<H3>Brief Description</H3>

The LIMITS project is an attempt to create a new method of 
providing access to relevant medical literature for students.  
The goal of this project is to overcome physical obstacles by 
providing readily accessible electronic information 24 hours 
a day to any location with Internet access.<P>

The LIMITS project consists of a core database of selected 
references to the medical literature (Medline abstracts) with 
indexing links to common medical problems.  In addition, 
annotations or reviewers comments can be appended to the 
abstracts to further clarify the usefulness or relevance of 
a particular article.<P>

Initially this pilot project will consist of indexing 500 core articles on 80-100 common clinical problems with selected annotations.  We plan to implement a WWW forms based system for submitting additional articles for inclusion on this system.<HR>

</UL><HR>
<H3>Background</H3><PRE>
Medical students can be overwhelmed by the medical information 
explosion and ever expanding medical literature. While the availability 
of the Medline database has improved accessibility to the literature, it 
has not aided the student in distilling the relevant information from the 
unimportant or erroneous literature. Many poorly designed research 
studies may still reach publication and need to be interpreted with 
caution. <A NAME="CITE1" HREF= "#REF1">Prior studies</A> [1-3] have also questioned the ability of students 
to perform effective Medline searches. Medline does not attempt to 
prioritize information on either importance or relevance to the topic of 
interest. A typical Medline search on a common medical problem or illness 
may retrieve over 100 articles that a student would need to sort through 
to hopefully find several key articles of interest. <A NAME="CITE4" HREF= "#REF4">Larry Weed</A> [4] described 
the need for Problem-Knowledge coupling to link relevant literature to 
common clinical problems seen in everyday medical practice.  Medical 
students would be ideal candidates to use such a system since their own 
medical knowledge is limited and their judgment may not be sufficiently 
developed at this early point in their careers to be able to sort and 
prioritize relevant medical literature that they may encounter. 

</PRE>
<H3>Rationale</H3><PRE>
The LIMITS project is an attempt to create a new method of providing access 
to relevant medical literature by establishing a linkage between clinical 
problems and the literature. In the past, attempts have been made to create 
such information resources through the use of article files maintained by 
faculty or chief residents on various clinical topics. These files frequently 
became outdated and were often inaccessible, frequently being locked up in 
an office filing cabinet. Other attempts have included article handouts or 
bibliographies frequently included in a course syllabus. However, these 
are usually lost or filed away and are not accessible when clinical problems 
arise and the literature is needed. The purpose of the LIMITS project is to 
overcome these previous obstacles and provide readily accessible 
information 24 hours a day to any geographic location with computer access. 
This would be especially useful for off campus clinical rotations. 

</PRE>
<H3>Description</H3><PRE>
The LIMITS project consists of a core database of annotated references to 
the medical literature with links to common medical problems and the 
Medline database. This linkage will be dynamically structured to provide 
for regular updating and provide a flexible way to index the information. 
For example, for a particular disease you may have a "table of contents" 
and then be able to choose an article on "diagnosis" or "treatment" of the 
condition. A "hypertext" capability could be used that would enable a user 
to select directly on those terms to link to an article.  In addition, the 
database may simultaneously have hypertext links to a course syllabus 
covering several different clinical problems that a student could search 
from. Thus, this system would allow for multiple "front-ends" to the 
article database. The database would also be accessible through boolean 
type "key word" searching used to access the traditional Medline database, 
or even a possible WAIS interface (Wide Area Information Server -  an 
indexed distributed text based search system). Future additions may 
include linkage to the controlled vocabulary of the NLM Metatheasaurus. 
Linkage to Medline may include pointers to U.I. (unique identifier) numbers. 
In addition to providing links to the relevant literature, provisions will 
be made to allow annotations or comments to be appended to the links 
to further clarify the usefulness or relevance of a particular article.

A pilot project has been funded by the MCW Learning Resources Subcomittee.
This will consist of indexing 500 core articles on 80-100 common clinical 
problems with selected annotations. These articles would be selected by the 
project faculty in cooperation with the clinical faculty, Chief Residents and 
student Clerkship Directors. If this project is successful, this could be 
expanded to additional problem areas while the existing indexed material is 
revised and updated as needed. In the future, we plan a WWW forms based 
interface to submit additional articles for  addition to this database.

</PRE>
<H3>Evaluation Strategy</H3><PRE>
We will assess the effectiveness of this project through the tracking of 
usage throughout the project period. A mechanism for immediate on-line 
user feedback through electronic mail (e-mail) will be made available. At 
the end of the project period, a survey instrument will be used to obtain 
user feedback and assess the utility of the information provided by this 
system in relation to the various student rotations. Course directors will 
also be surveyed to determine the degree to which use of this system was 
incorporated into their course curricula.

        often said that the 'past is prologue,' a testimonial,
        endorsement or result in a particular case does not
        constitute a promise, prediction or guarantee regarding

        represent The Alexander Law Firm commits its best
        efforts. Those efforts over the years are reported here.
        Each case was dependent on a multiplicity of factors and
        unique facts. Because of many different factors, results
        always will differ from case to case. For that reason the
        results that we obtained in these cases are no guarantee
        that we can again achieve the same results in any future
        case. In fact to understand what we achieved in these
        cases we have provided a substantial amount of
        information, including references to news articles and
        court files, so anyone can evaluate and make their own
        determination of the result and our record. There is only
        common factor in all the cases reported here: the
        plaintiff was represented by Richard Alexander or The
        Alexander Law Firm.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><a name="intro"><strong>COMMITTED TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU AND THE COMMUNITY</strong></a></p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm is committed to making a difference for our clients and to contributing to the improvement of life in 
our community and our country.</p>
<p>We represent consumers and owners of small businesses across the United States. Our expertise is in negligence, <a href="txt/intro.html#toxic">toxic 
chemical</a>, <a href="txt/intro.html#product">defective product</a>, mass accident, <a href="txt/intro.html#toxic">environmental</a>, and consumer fraud cases for individuals and in class actions, a 
powerful legal procedure for holding accountable wrongdoers who have injured groups of individuals.</p>
<p><a name="partner"><strong>YOUR LAWYER - YOUR PARTNER</strong></a></p>
<p>We only agree to represent clients for whom we can make a difference and with whom we share a common commitment to a 
common cause. It is the reason why we are known for our enthusiasm and driving effort to obtain a just result.</p>
<p>When we agree to become your attorneys we work on a contingency fee basis. We do not expect to be paid unless we are 
successful and under a written agreement we promise to bear the cost of preparing a case for trial. As long as our clients 
follow our advice, if there is no recovery, there are no charges: no fees and no costs.</p>
<p>If we are successful in a class action case, we petition the court for our fees to be paid as a percentage of a common fund or 
to order the wrongdoer to pay our fees. We view our relationship as a special responsibility and a partnership with our clients. 
As in any partnership we require that our clients work closely <strong>with us</strong> to assure shared and informed decision-making.</p>
<p><a name="people"><strong>THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</strong></a></p>
<p>Decades of experience in challenging litigation bring to The Alexander Law Firm an enviable infrastructure of staff, 
researchers, and experts who play a crucial role in preparing winning cases.</p>
<p>The firm's tight focus on difficult, complex cases for individuals and small businesses in negligence, <a href="txt/intro.html#toxic">toxic chemical</a>, <a href="txt/intro.html#product">defective 
product</a>, mass accident, <a href="txt/intro.html#toxic">environmental</a> and fraud cases provides a professional environment for these individuals to excel in 
developing leading-edge evidentiary techniques. This makes for second-to-none &quot;tactical support&quot;--an invaluable asset for any 
client.</p>
<p>All these things allow you to be confident that the firm will represent you in the most professional, exhaustive, and resolute 
manner.</p>
<p><a name="resources"><strong>RESOURCES</strong></a></p>
<p>Giving a client a 110% effort means not skimping on evidentiary resources. An example? When a BMW needed to be 
purchased and crashed to prove a point--we didn't hesitate. In fact, <i>we crashed two</i>. Whether it's a <a href="txt/compute.html">computer simulation</a> of a 
toxic cloud, a microscopic inspection of airborne asbestos, high speed photography of a gas tank failure, or complex 
programming to prove damages for homeowners living on defective foundations, we throw the full weight of audio, visual and 
sensory elements at making a case. Mastering these and other sophisticated technologies has become an essential tool in our 
practice.</p>
<p>Doing these kinds of things takes money--quite often, lots of it. We bear all costs in preparing a case. It's another investment 
we take very seriously. When faced with serious damages and institutions looking to protect their financial interests, our clients 
regard this financial capacity quite literally as the opened door to justice.</p>
<p><a name="readiness"><strong>READINESS</strong></a></p>
<p>Because we limit our practice we are able to focus our resources and skills to act quickly, forcefully and effectively. When a 
client is accepted, momentum is immediate. Years of representing clients with challenging cases has taught us the value of 
keeping cases moving. We know and understand that our opponents are afraid of the courtroom, where the public will learn 
the truth, so we push to bring our client's cases to trial, while striving to create imaginative solutions that are in our client's 
interest. Nothing brings about a defendant's willingness to act reasonably more quickly than 12 jurors ready to hear all the 
evidence we have mustered.</p>
<p><a name="results"><strong>RESULTS</strong></a></p>
<p>We believe the difference between getting an expedient settlement and a just award often comes down to an attorney's innate 
determination, spirit and commitment. Settling too low can stem from lack of preparation or a lack of will. Getting justice 
demands both solid case preparation and the will to insist on a fair result. Many claim that they can deliver. We prefer facts 
and on these pages we open our record for your inspection.</p>
<p>We have a strong record of success confronting wrongdoers who have taken from our clients their property and have injured 
their well-being. Not the type of tyrant and oppressor fought two centuries ago on village greens with muskets, but modern 
day Redcoats who can be equally arrogant in their efforts to avoid responsibility for the damage they have caused. We meet 
them in the courtroom and we fight with facts before juries of citizens that we trust to follow the law and to separate fact from 
fiction. Some say that our success is due to a &quot;tough&quot; attitude . We call it having a passion for justice and fairness. It's why we 
have chosen 1776 to identify our practice. </p>

<h2>Contact Lenses: Settlement of Bausch &amp; Lomb Lens Wearer
Class Action</h2>

<hr>

<p>A court-approved settlement of a consumer class action
settlement against Bausch &amp; Lomb was announced on August 1,
1996. </p>

<p>Final approval of the proposed settlement is scheduled for
hearing on Nov. 26 in Birmingham, Alabama to determine if it is
fair to consumers. The fairness hearing will be two years after
the court certified a national RICO class on behalf of all
purchasers of Bausch &amp; Lomb's Optima and Medalist contact
lenses in November, 1994. <a href="lenseset.shtml">See the Notice
of Class Action Settlement for full details.</a> </p>

<p>Under the settlement Bausch &amp; Lomb will pay up to $68
million in cash and products to 1.5 million buyers of the
company's disposable lenses. Many wearers will receive from $25
to $50 in cash and $25 to $50 in coupons under the settlement as
a result of a class-action filed in May 1994 which alleged that
the company sold the same product under different brand names at
widely varying prices and engaged in a fraudulent marketing
scheme in order to gain market share in the disposal lens market.
The result was that some consumers paid much more because they
believed they were getting different lenses. </p>

<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb denies any wrongdoing in its re-labeling
program but agreed to pay up to $34 million in cash payments to
consumers and in addition provide the same amount in free
products, including contact lenses, sunglasses and skin-care
items.</p>

<p>Competition from Johnson &amp; Johnson led Bausch &amp; Lomb
to relabel its lenses to compete with Accuview disposable lenses
which have long held a premier share of the contact lens market.
At the time, Bausch &amp; Lomb was selling a long wear lens under
the name of Optima, which wholesaled to optometrists for
approximately $25. In order to enter the disposable market Bausch
&amp; Lomb simply repackaged its Optima lens and renamed it the
Medalist for intermediate wear and as the Sequence for disposable
use.</p>

<p>These new and identical products were represented to be
different, but the only true difference was the name on the
package and the price charged. </p>

<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb obtained FDA approval for its package
statements, and urged optometrists not to prescribe in a manner
other than advised by the manufacturer on the package, although
FDA approval for packaging only confirms that a given description
is accurate. At no time did the FDA compare all Bausch &amp; Lomb
soft contact lenses to determine whether or not there was any
difference in the products. </p>

<p>At the same time that optometrists were warned to only
dispense the products as Bausch &amp; Lomb ordered, the company
began an aggressive marketing program with optometrists urging
them to increase the number of returning patients and profits via
the sale of its disposable lenses. </p>

<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb sold to optometrists and opticians its
SeeQuence 2 lens which were renamed as Medalist, Optima FW and
Criterion Ultra FW. The lenses were resold at $4 to $25 a lens.
The price was not based on quality but how often the lenses were
to be replaced and constituted a scheme to allow Bausch &amp;
Lomb to compete against over manufacturers, while maintaining
cashflow.</p>

<p>Under the settlement, anyone who bought a Medalist, Optima or
Criterion lens from 1990 through April 1996 would be eligible for
refunds ranging from $2.68 in cash and coupons worth $10.66 per
lens.</p>

<p>The deadline for making a application for a refund under the
claims process is February 1, 1997.</p>

Management Committee prosecuting Roberts v. Bausch &amp; Lomb,
Inc.,U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Western
Division, No. CV-94-C-1144-W. See Wall Street Journal, November
2, 1994 and August 2, 1996 [B-2].</p>

        company would be developing wireless cable television
        systems and a high-speed wireless Internet system, but

        in its Fuddruckers restaurant business and as a result
        the value of DAKA stock was falsely inflated to $33 per

        and currency futures beginning in the 1980s through the
        1990s. Dean Witter claimed the investments, in light of
        its expertise, were &quot;safe&quot; and would yield high
        rates of return, but never fully, adequately or properly

        that Donnkenny and certain of its officers made false
        representions concerning Donnkenny's operating condition
        and financial results, which led investors to believe
        that Donnkenny had achieved a historical 30% growth rate.

        net income, and earnings per share for its fiscal years

        <p><strong>OAK TECHNOLOGY</strong> - Oak Technology
        executives were quick to report to Wall Street analysts
        that their shipping department was working around the
        clock and anyone checking found it was true. But the
        product shipped had little relationship to Oak
        Technology's actual sales, according to a class action
        lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court,
        because Oak was shipping products that company officials
        knew would be returned to the manufacturer. In the
        electronics industry shipping unwanted products is known
        as &quot;stuffing the distribution channel.&quot; The

        misleading financial statements in connection with the
        acquisition of Champion Healthcare Corporation earlier in
        1996. On October 9, 1996, Paracelsus announced that its
        earnings would be &quot;substantially&quot; lower because
        of accounting and financial reporting practices and
        procedures, just two months after the acquisition of
        Champion for $168 million of Paracelsus stock. During the
        same time Pacacelus issued and sold $325 million in notes
        and sold $40 million of common stock. </p>

        action has been filed for holders of Performance
        Nutrition stock during March 8, 1994 through and
        September 4, 1996. The Complaint alleges that officers
        misrepresented the company's performance to the public
        and failed to report material information, including the
        embezzlement conviction of a senior officer and failing
        to use proper accounting procedures. As a result the
        firm's earnings for the nine months ending June 30, 1996,
        plus year were misstated, and that its stock price was
        artificially inflated. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>PHYSICIAN RELIANCE NETWORK, INC.</strong> - On
        Sept. 17, 1996, a class action was filed purchasers of
        Physician Reliance stock during Feb. 12, 1996 to July 11,
        1996, inclusive which claims that the company
        misrepresented and omitted material information
        concerning the Company's Medicare billing practices which
        misstated the Company's financial condition in addition
        to violating Medicare reimbursement laws. As a result the
        price of Physician Reliance stock was falsely inflated to
        $27 per share. Later the stock plummeted to $13. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>PROXIMA CORPORATION</strong> - Purchasers of
        Proxima Corporation (`Proxima`) common stock during the
        period July 26, 1994 to August 17, 1995 paid artificially
        inflated prices based on claims that the company had
        successfully developed and was introducing revolutionary
        desktop projectors which would generate high profits in
        1997, according to the complaint filed on August 19,
        1996. In addition the company claimed that its new
        microlaser was moving toward profitability as planned.
        Neither was the case according to allegations in the
        complaint due to major shortages of key materials and
        critical components. The end result was that stock that
        sold at nearly $37 dropped to $18 and then to $13.50.
        But,before the bottom fell out, corporate insiders
        unloaded 700,000 shares to unsuspecting investors,
        pension funds and retirement funds at $37 a share,
        pocketing $19,000,000 which, should the allegations of
        the complaint be proven, be repaid to unsuspecting
        buyers. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>QUANTUM CORPORATION</strong> - On August 28,
        1996, Quantum Corporation and several officers were named
        in a class action in Santa Clara County Superior Court
        alleging misrepresentations concerning customer demand
        for a new line of disk drives and insider trading during
        the period Feb. 26, 1996 to June 13, 1996. Later Quantum
        admitted that demand for its new drives was substantially
        below expectations and resulting price cutting would
        necessarily have a negative effect on profits, which
        caused Quantum's stock to collapse in value. But before a
        drop in value of one-third of the stock's price, insiders
        sold 265,543 shares of their Quantum stock at inflated
        prices, several of Quantum's insiders sold <br>
        nearly all of their stock and insiders took an estimated
        $6.5 million in illegal trading &quot;profits&quot; from
        the pockets of innocent investors who did not have access
        to inside information. </p>
        <p><strong>QUARTERDECK CORPORATION</strong> - On Dec. 3,
        1996, a class action was filed in California Superior
        Court on behalf of purchasers of Quarterdeck Corporation
        common stock between January 26, 1996 to June 13, 1996
        alleging the company issued materially false and
        misleading statements about its products, revenues and
        profits which artificially inflated the price of
        Quarterdeck stock until the company reported sharply
        lower sales and a substantial operating loss for the
        third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1996.</p>
        <p><strong>READ-RITE CORPORATION</strong> - On Dec. 12,
        1996, a class action lawsuit was filed in the California
        Superior Court on behalf of purchasers of Read-Rite
        Corporation common stockbetween April 19, 1995 to January
        22, 1996 alleging that Read-Rite falsely represented that
        it was enjoying strong demand for its products due to
        shortages for disk drive components, had competitive
        advantages due to its leadership position, was
        successfully developing new advanced thin film recording
        heads and would achieve high profit margins and expected
        sustained profitable growth of over $1 billion in 1996,
        which resulted in the company's stock being artificially
        inflated to $49-1/2 per share. The complaint states the
        company used $50 million of Read-Rite's cash to
        re-purchase two million of Read-Rite's own shares on the
        open market, allowing eight insiders to sell 815,000
        shares and pocketing over $26.4 million. In truth,
        Read-Rite's business was suffering from serious
        undisclosed adverse conditions, including difficulties
        developing its new products, softening demand,
        accumulation of excess inventories and erosion of its
        technological edge and competitive position. As a result
        of these problems, Read-Rite's stock fell sharply to
        $9-5/8 per share.</p>

        Court for the Middle District for buyers of Riscorp, Inc.
        common stock from February 28, 1996 through November 14,
        1996. The complaint alleges the company, a managed care
        worker's compensation insurance company, sold $190
        million dollars in stock to the public by falsifying the
        company's previous financial performance and making false
        statements about Riscorp's earnings prospects and
        operations, including the growth in Riscorp's in-force
        premiums, without revealing that some officers had been
        sued for extortion, mail fraud and other violations of
        federal and state law and that earning expectations would
        be impossible to achieve. With these disclosures the
        price of the stock collapsed form $19 to about $4 per
        share. </p>
        <p><strong>RISCORP</strong> - On Jan. 22, 1997, a class
        action was filed in the United States District Court for

        Riscorp Inc. Class A common stock between Feb. 28, 1996
        and March 16, 1996. The complaint alleges that Riscorp,
        certain of its officers and directors, and the
        underwriters of the IPO violated the Securities Act of
        1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing
        to the investing public false and misleading statements
        regarding, among other things, Riscorp's financial
        performance, revenue, and earnings growth and their
        impact on the company's future. The Complaint<br>
        further alleges that as a result of these
        misrepresentations and omissions Riscorp's Class A common
        stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class
        Period.</p>
        <p><strong>SOLV-EX CORP.</strong> - On October 4, 1996, a

        stock between Feb. 15, 1995 and Sept. 30, 1996 paid
        inflated prices as a result of officers of the
        corporation misrepresenting the business, technologies,
        reserves, business prospects and value of Solv-Ex and by
        failing to make full disclosure of pertinent facts
        concerning the companies sales and prospects. </p>

        of law concerning misrepresentations made concerning
        current and future operations of the Stratosphere Tower
        Casino in Las Vegas which open in April of this year. The
        misrepresentations caused the stock to nearly double
        between December 1995 and April 1996 and allow insider
        traders to dump artificially inflated stock on innocent
        investors before the price crashed when the true facts
        were revealed, resulting in the stock price dropping to
        one-third of its December 1995 value. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>SUMMIT TECHNOLOGY, INC.</strong> - Summit

        than $100 million. Anyone who bought Summit stock between
        March 31,1995 and July 3, 1996 has a claim that Summit's

        shares of Symantec stock at artificially inflated prices,

<h2><a href="index.html">The Consumer Law Page</a> &#153; : Consumers Fight Back!:</h2>
<hr>
<p><font size=5>F</font>iling a consumer complaint with a local county consumer agency or the Better Business Bureau, and in some cases a Small Claims 
Court lawsuit, can be the best way to put a stop to consumer abuse by a local wrongdoer. In other cases, in which consumers are 
abused by major corporations, only the power of a consumer class action can correct misdeeds. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you already have read <a href="article/complain.shtml">How To Resolve Your Consumer Complaint: Self-Help or Class Action</a> please answer this short 
questionnaire to help us determine if your consumer fraud could be a class action. There is no charge and you are not obligated to 
take any action until you decide to do so. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he Alexander Law Firm represents individuals, consumers and small businesses from across the U.S. who have suffered damage. 
Every day we are asked to participate in many cases. While we are approached on far more cases than we can accept, we welcome 
your inquiries and if we can help we will. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>ur expertise is in negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, environmental, mass accident and fraud cases. As you know from 
the information provided on <a href="http://seamless.com/alexanderlaw">our home page</a> we do not prosecute frivolous cases and offer a substantial range of experience which is 
far beyond that of the traditional plaintiffs' law firm. Our philosophy and our record is set forth in detail on this website and we 
encourage prospective clients to study our record and compare it with others when needing a lawyer. It is difficult finding the &quot;right&quot; 
lawyer for a particular case, but it is an ultimately important decision. If we are not the &quot;right&quot; lawyer for you, we may know the &quot;right&quot; 
lawyer near you who can help you.</p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>ur primary work is representing plaintiffs in <a href="article/complain.shtml#class">class action lawsuits</a> against national and multi-national companies in both federal and 
state courts. A class action is an extremely powerful tool to hold a wrongdoer accountable in circumstances where an individual case 
would be inefficient or uneconomical. We carefully investigate all prospective cases before filing suit. We do not accept frivolous 
lawsuits, because unless we are successful, we are not paid. After the successful conclusion of a class action, we petition the court to 
order the wrongdoer to pay our attorneys fees on behalf of the class and to pay the cost of prosecuting the case. In cases in which a 
common fund has been created to benefit class members, we petition the court to allocate a percentage of the recovery as attorneys 
fees, much the same as in our individual cases.</p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>e accept cases for individuals on a contingency basis. We agree to pay all trial preparation costs necessary to prosecute a case 
and are only paid for our services if, and when, we are successful. We do not send bills or ask for retainers. As long as our clients 
follow our advice, if there is no recovery in either a class action or in an individual case, there is no charge for attorneys fee and the 
costs of prosecuting a case are our responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>o determine whether or not you have a case that we can accept, we need to know about you, the damages you suffered, the 
persons that caused the damage and what you hope to achieve by working with a qualified lawyer on your problem.</p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he information you provide in this online questionnaire will be kept confidential and will be sent directly to the electronic mail center 
of The Alexander Law Firm. After we receive your inquiry, we will contact you to discuss how we can help you.</p>
<p><font size=5>R</font>emember, the Internet is not confidential. We do not believe that the large volume of individual email on the net is monitored, but if 
you prefer unquestioned confidentiality you can address a letter to The Alexander Law Firm, P. O. Box 1330, San Jose, CA 
95109-1330 or fax to 408.287.1776 providing the information requested below.</p>

<p><strong>I. </strong><a name="Introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>
<p>Since the early 1990&#146;s, defendants have been regularly arguing, and federal courts have been 
regularly holding, that the express preemption provision of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments 
(&quot;MDA&quot;) to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts damages actions brought by injured 
consumers against medical device manufacturers. The MDA&#146;s preemption provision, 21 U.S.C. 
360k(a), states that certain federal &quot;requirements&quot; that are &quot;applicable&quot; to medical devices 
preempt certain &quot;requirements&quot; that states maintain &quot;with respect to&quot; medical devices.</p>
<p>In its June 26, 1996 decision in <em>Medtronic v. Lohr</em>, the Supreme Court firmly repudiated the 
broad preemption rulings of the lower federal courts. The case involved injuries caused by a 
<em>Medtronic</em> pacemaker and its related components, including the lead, which is a wire connected 
to the pacemaker that delivers the electrical impulse to the heart. Specifically, the Court held that 
all three of Lora Lohr&#146;s claims&#151;based on defective design, defective manufacture, and failure to 
warn&#151;were not preempted by the MDA. <em>Medtronic</em> represents a wide-ranging victory for 
injured consumers. The Court&#146;s ruling, however, is a complex one and requires careful study. We 
believe that when <em>Medtronic</em> is properly applied, the courts will hold that few, if any, product 
liability claims are preempted.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to present our views on the meaning and application of the 
<em>Medtronic</em> decision. To fully appreciate MDA preemption arguments, however, it is necessary to 
understand how MDA regulation operates. In Part II below, we describe the MDA&#146;s regulatory 
structure in general, but a full explanation is outside the scope of this article. We direct the reader 
to the statute and regulations, the <em>Medtronic</em> opinion, which discusses the MDA in some detail, 
and lower federal court opinions, particularly the Eleventh Circuit&#146;s opinion in <em>Medtronic</em>.</p>
<p>In Part III below, we briefly summarize the decision in <em>Medtronic</em>. Obviously, anyone responding 
to a post-<em>Medtronic</em> preemption argument must study the opinions in detail.</p>
<p>Then, in Part IV, we apply the <em>Medtronic</em> decision to various types of product liability claims 
concerning different types of devices. We conclude that virtually all claims can proceed and that 
<em>no</em> cases will be preempted in their entirety. There is, however, work to be done in assuring that 
future medical device cases escape the preemption defense. Our optimism in the aftermath of 
<em>Medtronic</em> assumes a full understanding of the decision and its proper application.</p>
<p>Finally, in Part V, we discuss <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s application to preemption provisions in other federal 
regulatory statutes that are similar, although not identical, to the MDA&#146;s preemption provision. In 
particular, we consider how <em>Medtronic</em> will affect preemption of damages actions under the 
Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. 
Over the past few years, the lower federal courts have held that, like the MDA, these statutes 
broadly preempt personal-injury claims. In our view, these decisions are difficult to square with 
<em>Medtronic</em>, and we offer suggestions on litigating future FHSA and FIFRA cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. </strong><a name="Brief"><strong>A Brief Overview of the Medical Device Amendments</strong></a></p>
<p>For present purposes, there are three important facts about MDA regulation. <em>First</em>, each medical 
device falls into one of three classes. In theory, as the potential risks from the device increase, so 
does regulatory scrutiny under the MDA. Class I devices, such as band aids, are the least risky 
and are subject only to &quot;general controls&quot; applicable to all devices, such as general labeling 
requirements and good manufacturing practices rules promulgated by the Food and Drug 
Administration (&quot;FDA&quot;), the agency charged by Congress with implementing the MDA. Class II 
devices are more likely to cause harm if they are defective or misused, and thus the FDA may 
subject them to &quot;special controls,&quot; such as a specific labeling requirement. For instance, Class II 
tampons must carry a specific warning label required by the FDA. The vast majority of Class II 
devices, however, are not subject to any special controls.</p>
<p>Finally, Class III devices&#151;such as heart valves or the pacemaker leads at issue in 
<em>Medtronic</em>&#151;are those that, in theory, cannot be marketed until the FDA has found, after 
reviewing clinical data, that the device presents a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. 
This process is known as pre-market approval (&quot;PMA&quot;). However, there is an important 
exception to PMA for Class III devices: the &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; exception. If a Class III 
device is &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to a device marketed before the MDA&#146;s 1976 effective date, 
or to a device that itself was found to be substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 device, that device 
need not obtain PMA unless and until the FDA issues a regulation requiring PMA for that type of 
device. Products that enter the market based on &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; are known as 510(k) 
devices, after the section of the Act under which claims of substantial equivalence are made. Most 
Class III devices enter the market via section 510(k), and thus escape PMA, because the FDA 
has not issued the required PMA regulation. (Class I and II devices also enter the market 
pursuant to section 510(k), but by definition are not subject to PMA).</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, in rare instances, the FDA has issued device-specific requirements for particular types of 
devices. For instance, in addition to the tampon warning label mentioned above, the FDA has 
required that hearing aids bear certain labels, and that tampon absorbency be tested in a certain 
manner.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, the FDA has issued regulations concerning the scope of preemption under 21 U.S.C. 
360k(a). These regulations, which construe the MDA&#146;s preemptive effect quite narrowly, are 
discussed in considerable detail in the <em>Medtronic</em> decision. They should be carefully consulted in 
every case where an MDA preemption defense is raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Decision"><strong>III. The Decision</strong></a></p>
<p>Justice Stevens&#146; opinion is the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, the critical Part 
V, and Part VII. With respect to these Parts, the opinion is binding on all of the Nation&#146;s federal 
and state courts. Three other Justices joined the entire opinion including Parts IV and VI. Justice 
Breyer concurred in the judgment in full and joined in Parts I, II, III, V, and VII. The remaining 
four Justices concurred in part and dissented in part, in an opinion by Justice O&#146;Connor.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="Opinion"><strong>A. The Opinion of the Court</strong></a></p>
<p>Three holdings contained in Justice Stevens&#146; opinion are 
unanimous. (1) The Court unanimously rejected <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s 
position that the MDA preempts all common-law claims against 
manufacturers for damages caused by medical devices. (2) The 
Court unanimously ruled that design-defect claims involving 
section 510(k) devices are not preempted. (3) The Court 
unanimously ruled that claims based on a manufacturer&#146;s failure to 
comply with duties &quot;equal to, or substantially identical to, 
requirements&quot; imposed under the MDA or FDA regulations are 
not preempted.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Court, on behalf of five Justices, further held 
that the Lohrs&#146; manufacturing and labeling claims were not 
preempted, even if they did more than merely seek to enforce the 
federal requirements. Justice Stevens&#146; opinion looked to both the 
statutory language and FDA regulations and noted the 
&quot;overarching concern that pre-emption occur only where a 
particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific 
federal interest.&quot; The statute and regulations, the Court held, 
&quot;require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting 
federal requirement and the allegedly pre-empted state 
requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended 
pre-emptive scope of the statute and regulations.&quot;</p>
<p>The generality of the good manufacturing requirements and the 
labeling requirements applicable to <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s pacemaker lead, 
the Court held, militated against a finding of preemption. Those 
federal requirements, the Court said, reflect &quot;important but entirely 
generic concerns about device regulation generally, not the sort of 
concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulation 
which the statute or regulations were designed to protect from 
potentially contradictory state requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, in probably the most significant passage in the entire 
opinion, the Court noted that the common-law claims at issue rely 
upon general state-law duties that are not directed specifically to 
medical devices. Thus, the Court found, the general duties to use 
due care in manufacturing and to warn users of potential risks 
pose no threat to federal requirements and are not the type of 
requirements that Congress or the FDA feared would impede 
FDA&#146;s ability to enforce specific federal laws and regulations. 
Because of their generality, such state-law claims are outside the 
prohibited category of requirements &quot;with respect to&quot; specific 
devices, within the meaning of section 360k(a).</p>
<p>Only three Justices&#151;Justices Kennedy, Souter, and 
Ginsburg&#151;joined Parts IV and VI of Justice Stevens&#146; opinion. In 
Part IV, Justice Stevens looked to the MDA&#146;s language and 
legislative history to conclude that section 360k(a) was not 
intended to preempt most, let alone all, damages actions. The 
statutory language and legislative history, Justice Stevens noted, 
distinguish the MDA from the statute at issue in <em>Cipollone v. 
Liggett Group</em>, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992). In Part VI, the 
four-justice plurality stated that it need not decide whether a 
damages action could ever be a preempted &quot;requirement&quot; within 
the meaning of section 360k(a). The Justices reasoned that, since 
none of the Lohrs&#146; claims was preempted, a decision on that issue 
was not necessary. Moreover, because both the state and federal 
requirements would have to be highly specific before preemption 
could occur under section 360k(a) and the FDA&#146;s preemption 
regulations, it appeared that few, if any, common-law duties 
would ever be preempted. And, even in a case where the Court 
might find a damages claim preempted by the MDA, it might not 
need to resolve the express preemption question if the claim 
would also be preempted under conflict preemption principles.</p>
<p><a name="Breyer"><strong>B. Justice Breyer&#146;s Concurrence</strong></a></p>
<p>Justice Breyer concurred entirely in the judgment, as set forth in 
Justice Stevens&#146; opinion. He wrote separately to state his view 
that the reference to state-law &quot;requirements&quot; in section 360k(a) 
<em>does</em> encompass state-law damages suits, an issue as to which he 
agreed with the dissent.</p>
<p>Justice Breyer agreed with the principal opinion that none of the 
Lohrs&#146; claims was preempted, joining fully in that part of the 
opinion that analyzed each cause of action and found none of 
them preempted by the MDA. He stated that the applicable FDA 
requirements concerning the Lohrs&#146; claims were not &quot;specific&quot; in 
any relevant sense and that the FDA, as expressed in the 
agency&#146;s preemption regulation, 21 C.F.R. section 808.1(d), did 
not intend general, non-specific requirements to be preemptive. 
He noted that the language of section 360k(a) reflected basic 
principles of conflict preemption, but found no conflict between 
any federal requirement and any of the Lohrs&#146; claims. He further 
found no indication that &quot;Congress or the FDA intended the 
relevant FDA regulations to occupy entirely any relevant field.&quot;</p>
<p>Justice Breyer explained that he did not join in Part IV of the 
Court&#146;s opinion because he thought it unnecessary to the 
disposition of the case. He did not join in Part VI because he was 
not convinced that MDA preemption of common-law claims 
would be &quot;rare.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Dissent"><strong>C. The Concurrence in Part and Dissent in Part</strong></a></p>
<p>Justice O&#146;Connor concurred in part and dissented in part. Her 
opinion was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia 
and Thomas. She stated that common-law claims can constitute 
&quot;requirements&quot; within the meaning of section 360k(a), and she 
rejected the notion that there need be any specificity of either the 
federal preempting requirement or the state preempted 
requirement. Although concurring with the majority that the Lohrs&#146; 
design-defect claim was not preempted by the MDA, she stated 
that the Lohrs&#146; manufacturing-defect and failure-to-warn claims 
should be preempted to the extent they seek to impose 
requirements that are different from or additional to those 
imposed by the FDA&#146;s general good manufacturing and labeling 
rules. But she agreed with the majority&#146;s position that the Lohrs&#146; 
manufacturing-defect and failure-to-warn claims were not 
preempted to the extent that they allege violations of federal 
requirements.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a name="Applying"><strong>IV. Applying the </strong><em><strong>Medtronic</strong></em><strong> Amalysis to Medical Device Cases</strong></a></p>
<p>In light of the <em>Medtronic</em> decision, we now analyze MDA preemption by considering devices 
marketed at different levels of MDA regulation and by reviewing different types of product liability 
claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="Products"><strong>A. 510(k) &quot;Substantial Equivalence&quot; Products </strong></a></p>
<p><em>Medtronic</em> involved a 510(k) product which arrived on the market based on the 
manufacturer&#146;s claim of substantial equivalence to a pre-MDA device. In Part V 
of its opinion, the Court held that <em>none</em> of the standard product liability causes of 
action&#151;design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure to warn&#151;were 
preempted by the MDA. Justice Breyer fully joined this portion of the opinion, 
and noted in his concurrence that the same result was also required by conflict 
preemption principles. Thus, section 360k(a) does not preempt <em>any</em> claims 
regarding 510(k) products. The ruling applies to the vast majority of devices 
currently on the market&#151;all Class I and Class II devices (such as tampons), and 
most Class III devices, including silicone gel-filled breast implants, most 
pacemakers and their component parts, penile implants, and most other prosthetic 
and implantable devices.</p>
<p><a name="Investigational"><strong>B. Investigational Devices</strong></a></p>
<p>Some devices are marketed under an Investigational Device Exemption 
(&quot;IDE&quot;)&#151;a sort of FDA-approved experiment which allows an unapproved 
device to be used in humans in order to collect data. The manufacturer is 
exempted from typical pre-market approval obligations and other MDA demands 
during the term of the IDE. As the FDA puts it, an IDE &quot;permits a device that 
otherwise would be required to comply with a performance standard or to have 
pre-market approval&quot; to be used &quot;for the purpose of conducting investigations of 
that device.&quot; A few circuit courts prior to <em>Medtronic</em> had found preemption in 
cases involving an IDE. Those courts held that, although an IDE imposes no 
specific substantive obligations on a manufacturer, its<em> procedural</em> demands (e.g., 
applying for an IDE, collecting the data under FDA procedures) had preemptive 
effect.</p>
<p>This analysis&#151;to the extent that it was ever justified&#151;was swept away by 
<em>Medtronic</em> for several reasons. <em>First</em>, the IDE process imposes no significant 
substantive requirements on the design, manufacture, or labeling of medical 
devices. Both Part V of the Court&#146;s opinion and Justice Breyer&#146;s concurrence 
make clear that a high degree of substantive regulation on the same subject matter 
as the state-law duty relied upon is necessary before preemption can occur. To 
use the example given in Justice Breyer&#146;s concurrence, even a federal rule as 
specific as one requiring that hearing aids use a 2-inch wire would not preempt 
state rules about the packaging or shipping of hearing aids. Thus, as applied to a 
state design-defect claim, for example, if the 510(k) process, which at least 
makes the demand of product equivalence, does not preempt (as the Court held), 
then the IDE process, which does not make even that demand, surely does not 
have preemptive effect. So, too, with other standard product liability causes of 
actions, such as those involved in <em>Medtronic</em>, under which IDE products are 
subject to <em>less </em>substantive regulation than other MDA-regulated products.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, the reliance on FDA regulations concerning the scope of preemption 
both by the Court majority and Justice Breyer is relevant in the IDE context. 
Under 21 C.F.R. 50.20, the informed consent form that the patient must sign 
before using an IDE device &quot;may [not] include any exculpatory language through 
which the subject ... is made to waive or appear to waive&quot; the manufacturer&#146;s 
liability for negligence. While not an interpretation of the MDA&#146;s preemption 
provision, section 50.20 is a gap-filling interpretation of the MDA, which makes 
clear that the IDE process was not intended to obliterate state damages remedies. 
Since the Court majority deferred to the FDA&#146;s views on preemption of state law, 
the similar concern toward state-law remedies expressed in section 50.20 should 
carry considerable weight in the IDE context.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, consistent with our understanding of <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s effect on future IDE 
cases, on the Monday after <em>Medtronic</em> was handed down, the Supreme Court 
granted certiorari in a Sixth Circuit case which had held that the IDE process 
preempted the plaintiff&#146;s claims, vacated the Sixth Circuit&#146;s ruling, and remanded 
for reconsideration in light of <em>Medtronic</em>. Particularly when juxtaposed with the 
Court&#146;s other rulings on pending MDA preemption cases issued the same day, the 
Court&#146;s action in the Sixth Circuit case is very favorable.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, as discussed in more detail in Part IV.E. below, even if the IDE 
regulations did impose substantive requirements that could have preemptive effect, 
a plaintiff would be free, under state law, to sue to enforce the IDE requirements. 
All nine justices agreed that damages suits seeking to enforce federal requirements 
are not preempted.</p>
<p><a name="Market"><strong>C. Pre-Market Approval Devices</strong></a></p>
<p>Although <em>Medtronic</em> did not involve a device that had gone through PMA, we 
believe that Justice Stevens&#146; majority opinion requires that preemption be rejected 
in such circumstances. In addition, rulings issued by the Supreme Court a few 
days after the decision in <em>Medtronic</em> strongly support this position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. As noted earlier, the position of the Court majority, as 
expressed particularly in Part V of the opinion, is that preemption 
requires a high degree of specificity and substantive overlap with 
regard to both the potentially preemptive federal requirement and 
the potentially preempted state law. On the federal side, just as 
the majority noted with respect to the 510(k) process, the FDA 
does &quot;not &#146;require&#146; [a PMA device] to take any particular form 
for any particular reason.&quot; The PMA process, while more 
scientifically rigorous than 510(k), applies to devices <em>generally</em>: it 
demands that all PMA devices have a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; of 
safety and effectiveness, but it does not &quot;require&quot;&#151;to use the 
language of section 360k(a)&#151;any <em>specific </em>design, manufacturing 
process, or labeling. Thus, as the majority put it in referring to 
FDA labeling and manufacturing rules, there is no &quot;specific 
mandate on manufacturers or producers&quot; in the PMA rules. This 
position is well stated in the Solicitor General&#146;s <em>amicus</em> brief in 
Medtronic in a discussion of Ms. Lohr&#146;s design-defect claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither the FDCA nor the FDA&#146;s regulations 
prescribe criteria for the design of devices. The 
design of a device originates with its 
manufacturer.... [Design] specifications are 
applicable to a device as a result of a voluntary 
decision of a private party, the manufacturer, to 
introduce the device into the market with a design 
of the manufacturer&#146;s choosing. That federal law 
attaches a consequence to such private decisions 
does not convert them into federal &quot;requirements.&quot; 
Cf. <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens</em>, 115 S. 
Ct. [817, 824 (1995)].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the final paragraph of Part V of the Court&#146;s opinion is 
highly significant. That paragraph shows that, for preemption to 
occur, a great deal of specificity is required on the state-law side 
of the preemption equation&#151;a specificity generally absent from 
state damages suits. Because of the importance of this paragraph, 
we quote it in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the general state common-law 
requirements in this case were not specifically 
developed &#146;with respect to&#146; medical devices. 
Accordingly, they are not the kinds of 
requirements that Congress and the FDA feared 
would impede the ability of federal regulators to 
implement and enforce specific federal 
requirements. The legal duty that is the predicate 
for the Lohrs&#146; negligent manufacturing claim is the 
general duty of every manufacturer to use due 
care to avoid foreseeable dangers in its products. 
Similarly, the predicate for the failure to warn 
claim is the general duty to inform users and 
purchasers of potentially dangerous items of the 
risks involved in their use. These general 
obligations are no more a threat to federal 
requirements than would be a state-law duty to 
comply with local fire prevention regulations and 
zoning codes, or to use due care in the training 
and supervision of a workforce. These state 
requirements therefore escape pre-emption, not 
because the source of the duty is a judge-made 
common-law rule, but rather because their 
generality leaves them outside the category of 
requirements that &#167;360k envisioned to be &quot;with 
respect to&quot; specific devices such as pacemakers. 
As a result, none of the Lohrs&#146; claims based on 
allegedly defective manufacturing or labeling are 
pre-empted by the MDA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having already disposed of the design-defect claim on the ground 
that section 510(k) has no preemptive effect, the above-quoted 
paragraph dealt only with the manufacturing and duty-to-warn 
claims. However, its rationale&#151;that the state-law duties are 
general duties to use due care or to inform&#151;applies fully to a 
claim of defective design concerning both PMA and non-PMA 
products. Indeed, under the common law of Florida (where the 
Lohrs&#146; claims arose), the scopes of the duties in design-defect 
and manufacturing-defect cases are identical. Thus, the fact that a 
device has received PMA should not, under <em>Medtronic</em>, bar any 
of the standard product liability causes of action.</p>
<p>Justice Breyer&#146;s concurrence adds force to this analysis. In his 
view, the FDA has the power to determine, within the broad 
statutory mandate, which kinds of federal law have preemptive 
effect, and the FDA did not intend the requirements applicable in 
<em>Medtronic</em>&#151;which are at the same level of generality as those 
applicable in the PMA context&#151;to have preemptive effect. It is 
worth noting, too, that at least as to the design-defect claim, 
nothing in Justice O&#146;Connor&#146;s dissent demands a conclusion of 
preemption in PMA cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, PMA products are subject to the very same labeling 
and good manufacturing practice rules that the Court in 
<em>Medtronic</em> found did not preempt Ms. Lohr&#146;s garden-variety 
manufacturing-defect and failure-to-warn claims. Thus, such 
claims are not preempted in the PMA context. Although the FDA 
reviews and passes on the proposed labeling when it considers a 
PMA application, the same general substantive &quot;requirements&quot; 
apply to the labels of all MDA products. Moreover, the Court, in 
the portion of its opinion holding that claims of non-compliance 
with federal law are not preempted, pointed out that an FDA 
regulation permits manufacturers of PMA devices to make certain 
labeling, quality control, and manufacturing changes to enhance 
product safety <em>without prior FDA approval</em>. In light of that 
regulation, damage claims regarding a failure to warn would not 
generally be &quot;different from, or in addition to&quot; the federal 
requirement within the meaning of section 360k(a).</p>
<p>Finally, it bears emphasis that, although not specifically addressed 
in the <em>Medtronic</em> opinion, a claim that a manufacturer should have 
warned by means other than the product label would not be 
preempted under either <em>Medtronic</em> or the reasoning of the 
Court&#146;s earlier decision in <em>Cipollone</em>. Part V of the Opinion 
requires an overlap between the specific federal rules at issue and 
the theory of the state-law duty at issue. Justice Breyer&#146;s 
concurrence also strongly suggests this point, by explaining that a 
federal rule on one aspect of hearing aid regulation would not 
preempt state-law on another aspect of hearing aid regulation. 
And in his <em>amicus</em> brief filed in <em>Medtronic</em>, the Solicitor General, 
relying on <em>Cipollone</em>, specifically stated that a non-label-related 
failure-to-warn claim would not be preempted. </p>
<p>2. On the Monday following the <em>Medtronic</em> decision, the Court 
disposed of numerous certiorari petitions in MDA preemption 
cases that had accumulated while <em>Medtronic</em> was pending. These 
actions were very significant. In each of the cases involving a 
510(k) device, where the lower court had held that some or all of 
the plaintiff&#146;s claims were preempted, the Supreme Court granted 
the petition, vacated the decision below, and remanded for 
reconsideration in light of its <em>Medtronic</em> decision. In addition, the 
Supreme Court granted, vacated, and remanded a Seventh 
Circuit PMA case involving injuries allegedly suffered from 
collagen injections, where the court of appeals had affirmed 
dismissal of the entire case on preemption grounds. However, in a 
second PMA collagen case, in which the Ninth Circuit had held 
that no common-law claims are ever preempted by the 
MDA&#151;<em>and in that case only</em>&#151;the Court simply denied 
certiorari, leaving the Ninth Circuit&#146;s no-preemption precedent in 
place.</p>
<p>To grant, vacate, and remand a petition, the Court must have the 
votes of five justices. Therefore, the disposition of the Ninth 
Circuit PMA case indicates that the Court did not have the vote 
of Justice Breyer to remand that case, but did have his vote to 
remand the Seventh Circuit PMA case. This outcome further 
confirms our reading of Part V of the Court&#146;s opinion and the 
effect of Justice Breyer&#146;s joinder in it. While, ordinarily, the denial 
(or even the grant) of certiorari does not have precedential effect, 
granting, vacating, and remanding a case constitutes a ruling on 
the merits of a case. The combined effect of the opinion in 
<em>Medtronic</em> and of the Court&#146;s actions on the various pending 
petitions leaves little doubt that standard product-liability claims 
with respect to PMA devices are not preempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Action"><strong>D. Other Causes of Action</strong></a></p>
<p>While claims of defective design and manufacture and failure to warn, pled under 
negligence and/or strict liability theories, are the standard product liability claims, 
other claims are also regularly pled in medical devices case. We address the two 
most common types&#151;breach of express warranty and fraud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="Warranty"><strong>1. Breach of Express Warranty</strong></a></p>
<p>Under <em>Cipollone</em>, breach of express warranty claims are not 
preempted because they are grounded in a contractual duty 
between the parties, not in an independent obligation imposed by 
state law. Whether or not expressed on the product label, such 
claims (e.g., that the product has a lower failure rate than do the 
competitors&#146; products), thus are not preempted because they do 
not impose state-law &quot;requirements.&quot; <em>Medtronic</em> reaffirms and 
deepens this understanding. There are no FDA &quot;requirements&quot; 
concerning promises that a medical device manufacturer may or 
may <em>not</em> make, other than that it may not generally claim that its 
product has received FDA approval. Certainly, no FDA 
requirement concerning manufacturers&#146; warranties contains the 
degree of specificity demanded by the <em>Medtronic</em> opinion. 
Moreover, a state-law breach of warranty claim is not preempted 
because it falls squarely within the Court&#146;s discussion of &quot;general 
state ... requirements [that] were not specifically developed &#145;with 
respect to&#146; medical devices....&quot; Accordingly, breach of warranty 
&quot;requirements ... escape pre-emption, not because the source of 
the duty is a judge-made common-law rule, but rather because 
their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements 
that &#167; 360k envisioned to be &#145;with respect to&#146; specific devices....&quot; 
Indeed, as the Court pointed out, the FDA&#146;s preemption 
regulations specifically note that warranty claims under the 
Uniform Commercial Code are requirements of &quot;general 
applicability&quot; that are not preempted by section 360k(a).</p>
<p><a name="Fraud"><strong>2. Fraud</strong></a></p>
<p>State-law fraud claims are not preempted for much the same 
reasons that express warranty claims are not preempted. They are 
claims of general applicability grounded not in any specific 
requirement that a device be made in particular manner, but, as 
<em>Cipollone</em> teaches, in a general duty not to deceive. A claim, for 
instance, that a plaintiff&#146;s doctor was misled into prescribing a 
certain medical device has nothing to do with whether the product 
is defective. In fact, in finding no preemption of the labeling and 
manufacturing claims in <em>Medtronic</em>, the Court relied on 
<em>Cipollone&#146;s</em> holding that the fraud claims there were not 
preempted because, while they dealt in some sense with the 
preempted field of &quot;smoking and health,&quot; they were grounded in 
the more general common-law duty not to deceive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, neither the MDA nor any regulations promulgated 
thereunder contain general anti-fraud provisions with which a 
state-law fraud claim could conflict, and thus a fraud claim would 
clearly survive under <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s requirement that specific 
federal requirements be in place for preemption to occur. If the 
federal requirements for labeling and good manufacturing 
practices were too general to have preemptive effect in 
<em>Medtronic</em>, then surely a manufacturer&#146;s even more general duty 
to be truthful in its dealings with the FDA has no preemptive effect 
under the MDA.</p>
<p>The ability to prosecute fraud claims in the aftermath of 
<em>Medtronic</em> survives regardless of whether the claims are pled in 
their traditional common-law form or under a modern consumer 
protection statute prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and 
practices. Indeed, the FDA&#146;s preemption regulations, relied on by 
the Court, specifically note that state unfair trade practices 
requirements are not preempted by the MDA.</p>
<p>Fraud allegations in medical device personal-injury cases have 
often taken two distinct forms and have been analyzed separately 
in some MDA preemption cases. <em>First</em>, plaintiffs have alleged that 
they and their doctors have been defrauded into using a product 
that they would not have used had the manufacturer not deceived 
them. With respect to that claim, the foregoing analysis applies.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, plaintiffs have claimed&#151;particularly in collagen and 
Bjork-Shiley heart valve cases&#151;that the manufacturer defrauded 
the FDA into granting PMA for a particular product or into taking 
or failing to take some other regulatory action. Usually the claim is 
based on both affirmative misrepresentations to the agency and on 
the withholding of pertinent safety information from the agency. 
This type of claim&#151;although focused on the manufacturer&#146;s 
conduct toward the FDA rather than toward the public or medical 
professionals&#151;is still grounded in the general duty not to deceive 
and, thus, is not preempted under <em>Medtronic</em> and <em>Cipollone</em>. 
And even though the claim may, in some cases, demand an 
inquiry into the FDA&#146;s processes, no preemption-triggering 
federal <em>requirement</em> would be at issue in pursuing a state-law 
fraud-on-the-FDA claim. Prior to <em>Medtronic</em>, several courts had 
held that section 360k(a) preempted a fraud-on-the-FDA claim 
on the ground that it was up to the FDA, not state law, to police 
such fraud. Those holdings cannot withstand the holding in 
<em>Medtronic</em>, because, as noted earlier, they simply cannot be 
squared with the preemption provision and its implementing 
regulations, which say nothing about exclusive FDA authority and 
require the existence of specific federal <em>requirements</em> before 
preemption can occur. Moreover, as discussed in more detail 
below, preemption of fraud-on-the-FDA claims is inconsistent 
with the views of all nine Justices that state-law claims premised 
on non-compliance with federal law are not preempted. Thus, 
even if some federal <em>requirement</em> were relevant to the 
fraud-on-the-FDA cause of action, preemption could be defeated 
wherever the plaintiff claimed that, as a result of the fraud, FDA 
standards for product approval or any other relevant standard 
had not been met. For instance, the plaintiff could allege that the 
general requirement that manufacturers be truthful with the FDA in 
its labeling was violated, giving rise to liability under state law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Compliance"><strong>E. Non-Compliance Claims</strong></a></p>
<p>In <em>Medtronic</em>, the plaintiffs&#146; back-up position with regard to the 
manufacturing-defect and failure-to-warn claims was that, even if the general FDA 
rules regarding manufacturing and labeling had preemptive effect, a claim of 
negligence or strict liability premised on violations of those general FDA rules did 
not establish a requirement &quot;different from, or in addition to&quot; any federal 
requirement, but rather a requirement that was the same as the federal 
requirement. The majority opinion and the dissent agreed, concluding that tort 
claims alleging violation of federal rules or standards are not preempted by section 
360k(a).</p>
<p>Although the plaintiffs in <em>Medtronic</em> did not make a non-compliance argument 
with regard to their design-defect claim (there being no federal design standards), 
the Court&#146;s opinion (as well as the dissent) would allow claims seeking to enforce 
all existing federal MDA standards, such as that for misbranding. Indeed, for 
years state regulatory agencies have enforced federal device standards in many 
areas, and the FDA has encouraged those agencies to do so.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that a non-compliance claim arises under state law and 
is <em>not</em> a cause of action under the FDCA. The lower federal courts are in 
agreement that there is no implied right of action under the FDCA, and it is 
unlikely that this view will change. The proper allegation is that the manufacturer 
was negligent (or violated other state-law principles embodied in a statute or the 
common law) in failing to abide by federal device standards. Although it is 
probably not necessary to allege violation of federal standards in the complaint, 
<em>no one should risk being bounced from court for failing to plead the case 
properly</em>. Therefore, to be safe, and assuming one has the facts, the complaint 
should allege that the defendant violated state law (<em>e.g.</em>, was negligent or the like) 
for failing to abide by FDCA standards. For a failure-to-warn type claim, the 
general federal labeling standards can be alleged. For a manufacturing-defect 
claim, discovery may or may not be necessary before violation of individual good 
manufacturing practice rules can be alleged. However, even there the standards 
are so general that allegations will often be possible at the inception of the case. If 
the case is ultimately tried partially or entirely on a non-compliance basis, jury 
instructions will have to track the general federal standards, as well as the general 
liability standards under state law.</p>
<p><a name="Preempted"><strong>F. What May Be Preempted Under </strong><em><strong>Medtronic</strong></em><strong>?</strong></a></p>
<p>Justice Breyer did not join Parts IV and VII of Justice Stevens&#146; opinion, which 
therefore speak only for a four-Justice plurality. Justice Breyer expressed his view 
that the language of section 360k(a) encompasses preemption of damages claims 
(which the plurality strongly questioned), but only when there is considerable 
specificity in, and subject-matter overlap between, state and federal device 
requirements. As an example of where preemption would occur, he described a 
hypothetical case in which a plaintiff claimed that a manufacturer was negligent for 
failing to use a one-inch wire in a hearing aid, when the FDA <em>required</em> a two-inch 
wire. This result, although not a part of the opinion of the Court, when combined 
with the analysis of the four dissenters, appears to represent the view of five of the 
justices. Few state-law claims take the highly particularized form suggested by 
Justice Breyer, and few FDA requirements operate at that level of specificity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his analysis may require a finding of preemption in a few instances. 
For example, a duty-to-warn claim in a case involving a tampon, where the 
manufacturer gave the FDA-mandated warning, might be preempted, if the 
state-law claim was that the warning should have been different from that which 
the FDA requires. Even there, however, an analysis of whether FDA rules <em>forbid</em> 
manufacturers from adding to the label might be warranted, and, of course, 
non-label-related claims&#151;such as defective tampon design&#151;would not be 
preempted. And, as noted earlier, a failure-to-warn claim premised on a 
manufacturer&#146;s duty to warn by means other than the label should not be 
preempted under <em>Cipollone</em>. Moreover, according to all nine Justices, a state-law 
claim that the manufacturer did not provide the federal warning would not be 
preempted.</p>
<p>Thus, while a quite limited universe of claims may be preempted by combining the 
Breyer and O&#146;Connor analyses, we want to emphasize that no opinion expressing 
the views of the <em>Court</em> held that common-law claims come within the reach of 
section 360k(a) and a four-Justice plurality strongly suggested that they do not. 
Therefore, as MDA preemption cases move forward, we suggest that plaintiffs be 
prepared to press the view that section 360k(a) does not reach damages actions. 
In many if not all cases, fully briefing this issue may not be necessary, since the 
claims will not be preempted under the majority opinion in any event. Thus, the 
plaintiff may only want to mention the point briefly, but with clarity, so as to 
preserve the issue. There are two reasons for doing so. <em>First</em>, while adding up the 
views of the justices expressed in two separate opinions may reveal a good deal 
about the individual thinking of the current justices, the result does not represent a 
precedent of the Court. The plurality view expressed in Parts IV and VI of Justice 
Stevens&#146; opinion may ultimately be seen as more persuasive in the lower courts. 
<em>Second</em>, the no-preemption view should be argued because if and when another 
MDA preemption case is before the Supreme Court, the composition of the 
Court may have changed, providing an opportunity for plaintiffs to expand the 
four-Justice plurality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Statutes"><strong>V. OTHER STATUTES</strong></a></p>
<p>Other federal statutes contain preemption provisions, and the preemption defense has become a 
favorite of defendants in personal-injury and property-damage cases involving a wide range of 
products. Below, we focus on preemption under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (&quot;FIFRA&quot;) and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (&quot;FHSA&quot;) because the 
defendants&#146; preemption arguments have been particularly effective in connection with those 
statutes. Much of our analysis, however, may be relevant to other statutes containing similar 
express preemption provisions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="Rodent"><strong>A. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</strong></a></p>
<p>FIFRA&#146;s preemption section provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[States] shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for 
labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those 
required under this subchapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defendants have had considerable success in using this provision to avoid liability 
for damage caused to crops and land by pesticides. In fact, a majority of the 
federal circuit courts, as well as a number of state supreme courts, have found 
broad preemption of damages claims under FIFRA. In the future, however, 
several aspects of the <em>Medtronic</em> decision will be of particular help in defeating 
FIFRA preemption defenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <em>Medtronic</em> held that state requirements &quot;equal, or substantially 
identical&quot; to federal requirements were not preempted under the 
MDA, which, similar to FIFRA, preempts requirements &quot;different 
from or in addition to&quot; federal requirements. Thus, putting aside 
the question whether a damages remedy constitutes a 
&quot;requirement&quot; within the meaning of FIFRA&#146;s preemption 
provision, where a state-law damages claim alleges failure to 
comply with federal requirements, that claim is not preempted.</p>
<p>In FIFRA cases, this holding may be particularly useful for two 
reasons. <em>First</em>, the key language of FIFRA&#146;s preemption 
provision, referring to &quot;requirements&quot; that are &quot;in addition to, or 
different from&quot; federal requirements, is very similar to the language 
in section 360k(a) of the MDA.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, like many MDA requirements, the requirements of 
FIFRA are general and ongoing. For example, if a pesticide 
manufacturer knows or should know of an environmental risk 
posed by its product, the manufacturer is required to revise its 
labeling to reflect that risk. Thus, if a plaintiff claims that his or her 
land was damaged by a pesticide and that the risk of damage 
should have been disclosed on the product&#146;s label, the complaint 
should allege that the defendant negligently failed under state law 
to comply with duties imposed under FIFRA. In many cases, the 
common-law duties on which the plaintiff&#146;s allegations are based 
will mimic the defendant&#146;s duties under FIFRA, which places the 
burden of product testing, identification of product risks, and 
hazard labeling on the manufacturer.</p>
<p>2. Looking to the general language of section 360k(a) of the 
MDA and the generality of the FDA&#146;s regulations, <em>Medtronic</em> 
identified an &quot;over-arching concern that pre-emption occur only 
where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a 
specific federal interest.&quot; Thus, in considering the plaintiffs&#146; 
defective manufacturing and failure-to-warn claims, the Supreme 
Court made &quot;a careful comparison between the allegedly 
pre-empting federal requirement and the allegedly pre-empted 
state requirement to determine whether they fall within the 
intended pre-emptive scope of the statute and regulations.&quot; The 
Court concluded that the relevant federal requirements&#151;the FDA 
good manufacturing practices and general labeling 
rules&#151;reflected important but altogether generic concerns, not 
specific concerns which the statute or regulations were designed 
to protect from potentially contradictory state requirements. 
Similarly, the general common-law duties at issue in <em>Medtronic</em> 
were not specifically developed with respect to medical devices, 
and thus, the Court held, are not the kind of requirements that 
Congress or the FDA feared might impede the FDA&#146;s 
implementation and enforcement of the MDA.</p>
<p>Like the good manufacturing requirements and general labeling 
requirements of the MDA, FIFRA&#146;s labeling requirements are 
general. The Act&#146;s misbranding provisions require manufacturers 
to draft labeling to warn about their products&#146; principal dangers 
and to alter and supplement labeling after a product receives 
marketing approval. And in contrast to the statutorily prescribed 
warnings of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 at 
issue in <em>Cipollone</em>, pesticide registrants are obliged under FIFRA 
to update their labels to protect against adverse environmental 
effects.</p>
<p>Thus, in staving off a preemption defense in cases involving 
products regulated under FIFRA, it will be important to 
emphasize the generality of FIFRA&#146;s labeling requirements and 
the flexibility that FIFRA and the EPA give to manufacturers to 
draft labeling. FIFRA&#146;s preemption provision applies only to 
labeling and packaging and thus preemption of common-law 
claims should be relevant, if at all, only with regard to a claim that 
the defendant failed to warn about a product&#146;s hazards. However, 
some courts have recast various other claims as failure-to-warn 
claims when considering FIFRA preemption. Therefore, 
application of <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s analysis may be useful in preserving 
not only failure to warn claims, but also claims of negligent testing, 
defective design, and the like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Hazardous "><strong>B. Federal Hazardous Substance Act</strong></a></p>
<p>The FHSA, which is enforced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(&quot;CPSC&quot;), applies to thousands of products, ranging from toys to paint remover. 
The FHSA contains two preemption provisions, but in reported cases defendants 
have focussed on only one, section 18(b). Section 18(b), which is in some ways 
similar to the MDA&#146;s section 360k(a), provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f a hazardous substance or its packaging is subject to a 
cautionary labeling requirement under [the Act] designed to 
protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with the 
substance, no State or political subdivision of a State may 
establish or continue in effect a cautionary labeling requirement 
applicable to such substance or packaging and designed to 
protect against the same risk of illness or injury unless such 
cautionary labeling requirement is identical to the labeling 
requirement under [the Act].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although defendants have had substantial success in avoiding liability under this 
provision, <em>Medtronic</em> may alter this trend. As noted earlier, <em>Medtronic</em> deferred 
to the FDA's regulations narrowly interpreting the preemptive scope of the statute. 
This aspect of the decision is highly relevant in the FHSA context because the 
CPSC has promulgated preemption regulations that strongly suggest that <em>only</em> 
state statutes, regulations, and other positive laws are within the preemptive scope 
of the FHSA. Moreover, when the CPSC's preemption regulations were 
proposed, manufacturers specifically asked the CPSC to include common-law 
rules in its definition of the types of state requirements subject to preemption. In 
promulgating its final rule, the CPSC rejected the manufacturers' request on the 
ground that the statute did not provide for preemption of state-law damages 
actions. Under <em>Medtronic</em>, this interpretation of the statute by the expert agency 
should receive deference. </p>
<p>As discussed above, <em>Medtronic</em> held that state requirements &quot;equal, or 
substantially identical&quot; to federal requirements are not preempted under the MDA. 
Applying this holding to the FHSA, and again putting aside the question whether a 
damages remedy constitutes a &quot;requirement&quot; under the FHSA&#146;s preemption 
provision, a state-law damages claim alleging failure to comply with an FHSA 
cautionary labeling requirement is not preempted, since the Act expressly saves 
from preemption &quot;identical&quot; state requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, like FIFRA&#146;s preemption provision, section 18(b) applies only to<em> 
labeling</em> requirements. Moreover, many courts have stated that FHSA&#146;s 
preemption provision is effectively identical to FIFRA&#146;s. Accordingly, the above 
discussion of FIFRA can be applied in large part to FHSA cases. For instance, 
like labeling regulations under the MDA and FIFRA, FHSA&#146;s labeling rules are 
general and leave manufacturers significant freedom. Labels must include any 
language required by CPSC, and they must also include &quot;an affirmative statement 
of the principal hazard or hazards&quot; and &quot;precautionary measures&quot; for avoiding 
hazards. Labels may also include any other material, as long as that material does 
not negate or disclaim any federally required statement. Manufacturers do not 
even submit labeling to the CPSC for review, much less approval.</p>
<p>Thus, in pleading a failure-to-warn claim in a hazardous substance case, or in 
defending against a motion for summary judgment based on preemption, it will be 
important to emphasize the generality of FHSA&#146;s labeling requirements and the 
freedom accorded to manufacturers to design their own labels. Applying the 
<em>Medtronic</em> analysis, a manufacturer&#146;s duty to warn about hazards under the 
FHSA is substantially identical to the common-law duty to warn.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Medtronic</em> held that the MDA did not preempt the Lohrs&#146; design-defect 
claim because no federal requirement regulated the <em>design</em> of the medical device 
at issue. To use the example given by Justice Breyer in his concurrence, a specific 
design requirement for the length of a hearing aid wire would not preempt claims 
based on state-law requirements for hearing aids that were unrelated to the 
wire-length requirement. In the context of FHSA, <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s insistence on 
subject-matter congruence between the state and federal requirements means 
that, even where a federal cautionary labeling requirement is in place in connection 
with one product hazard, state-law claims alleging a failure to warn about a 
different hazard would not be preempted.</p>
<p>For example, if a specific CPSC requirement mandates that the label of products 
containing a particular chemical disclose a risk of poisoning if the product is 
ingested, a claim alleging failure to warn about the risk of toxicity through 
inhalation of that product should not be preempted because that claim would not 
create any risk of conflict with the federal requirement regarding the ingestion risk. 
Even before <em>Medtronic</em>, some decisions applied such an analysis because the 
FHSA&#146;s preemption provision preempts only state cautionary labeling 
requirements designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury as the 
federal cautionary labeling requirement. <em>Medtronic</em> affirms the reasoning of those 
cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Conclusion"><strong>VI. CONCLUSION</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Medtronic v. Lohr</em> represents a substantial victory for medical device consumers. With perhaps a 
few exceptions, <em>Medtronic</em> lifts the burden of the preemption defense from tort plaintiffs in 
personal-injury cases involving medical devices. In addition, <em>Medtronic</em>&#146;s reasoning should prove 
useful to plaintiffs seeking to defeat preemption defenses in cases involving products regulated 
under other federal laws.</p>

<h2>GM Pickup Truck Saddlebag Gas Tank Settlement</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Report of November 6, 1996 Fairness Hearing in Louisiana</strong></p>
<p>I do not know when the proposed GM gas tank pickup truck settlement will be final for several reasons and no one knows 
when you will be able to expect to receive your transferable certificate.</p>
<p>First, Judge Marionneaux of Iberville Parish, Plaquemine, Louisiana advised everyone appearing at the hearing on November 
6, 1996 that he would not rule until he first had heard from Judge Yohn of the federal court in Philadelphia. Judge Yohn is the 
federal judge coordinating all federal cases which have been consolidated for pre-trail proceedings in the U. S. District Court 
in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Second, several objectors have hired lawyers to object to the settlement and argue that it should not be approved because it 
did not force a recall of the 1973-87 GM C and K trucks with saddlebag tanks.</p>
<p>I explained to the court that fighting for a recall is extremely difficult in this case. There is not one reported decision in all of the 
U.S. in which a court has ordered an automobile manufacturer to recall vehicles. </p>
<p>Every recall that I am aware of has been under the legal authority of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 
Washington, D.C. In the case of saddlebag gas tanks, NHTSA has abandoned truck owners and has refused to demand a 
recall. That left lawyers for truck owners with only the ability to pursue economic compensation.</p>
<p>The economic package though is only one part of what we have proposed to the court. </p>
<p>As part of the settlement, GM has agreed to fund fuel tank safety research through an independent research effort in the 
amount of $4.1 million. In addition the lawyers representing truck owners have agreed to contribute another $1 million to 
unrestricted research specifically addressing the saddlebag gastanks.</p>
<p>In open court and in my declaration submitted in support of the proposed settlement as fair and reasonable under the 
circumstances, I explained my belief and hope that a high density polyethylene tank liner, such as has been successfully used in 
the Corvette since 1978, would prove to provide a low cost retro-fit that would be much safer than the present tank. The $1 
million research project would actively test such a fix, as GM did in some of its own crash testing in 1982 when three<br>
trucks were fitted with HDPE lined tanks and hit with a Chevrolet Citation at 50 miles per hour. In the final test, minimal gas 
was lost from a fully loaded tank. I believe that such a retro-fit can be designed and tested so that an after-market tank could 
be made available for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>As for the proposed settlement, no one can predict what a judge will do, but Judge Marionneaux's questions indicated he has 
a firm understanding on the limits of our class action and that an overwhelming number of owners have not objected or 
opted-out. </p>
<p>In fact, only .04% of all owners have objected to the proposed settlement and .17% have opted-out of the settlement, leaving 
99.79% of all owners expecting certificates. That is purer than Ivory Snow, which is what I told the court, and is a significant 
reason why this proposed settlement can and I believe will be finally approved. People want it. </p>
<p>But do not hold your breath for a certificate. In fact, you may choose to complain to the lawyer leading the opposition to the 
settlement who is keeping you from getting a certificate that you or a member of your family could use or keeping you from a 
certificate that you could sell: That lawyer is Joe McCray, 433 Turk Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, 415.775.3900. Mr. 
McCray is a fine lawyer who has objected to the settlement, although he readily admitted in open court that he &quot;does not have 
the foggiest idea about class actions&quot; for property damage, which is the essence of the current case. </p>
<p>I respectfully recommended and urged Mr. McCray and the other lawyers who have joined with him that this settlement is 
fair, reasonable and adequate in light of all the circumstances in this case and that his efforts in fashioning relief should have 
been focused on bringing this case, as I did in 1992, not objecting now when a recall in this case is an absolute impossibility. </p>
<p>To object now that the settlement should not go forward because it does not provide for a recall ignores the reality of this case 
and the decisive roll NHTSA plays in auto safety recalls. No matter what efforts he undertakes and no matter how long the 
appeal, there will never be a recall in this case because NHTSA has specifically said it will not require such action.</p>
<p>In short Mr. McCray and his colleagues are focusing on the role of courts in personal injury and wrongful death cases under 
products liability laws. Unfortunately those laws DO NOT APPLY TO PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES. Product liablity or 
strict liability in tort is a concept that is exclusive limited to personal injury and wrongful death claims. So, these lawyers are 
making the mistake of coming at a case from the wrong direction and with the wrong legal rules.</p>
<p>I have been involved in several recent and significant cases in which there were recalls: the buyback of 33,000 Nissan 
1987-89 minivans and the Chrylser rear hatch latch lock cases involving 4,000,000 vehicles. But in both these cases, the 
actual recall was part and parcel of a joint settlement of all civil claims and official NHTSA action. The details of those cases 
can be found on The Alexander Law web page [<a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">http://www.alexanderlaw.com</a>].</p>
<p>There will be no such NHTSA action in this case, because NHTSA has publicly refused to take such action and has agreed 
with GM that it will not.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that well intended, but misinformed objectors, are demanding a recall and retro-fit which is something that is 
impossible to accomplish under the special facts of this case. </p>
<p>Had NHTSA not abandoned truck owners when it reported it would not be pursuing a recall, then these objectors would 
have some basis on which to base a claim. </p>
<p>As it now stands, I believe the settlement will be approved by the trial court and that Mr.McCray's group will take an appeal, 
thereby delaying the implementation of the settlement until the court of appeal rules. The appeal will be based on claims that 
the truck should be recalled and retro-fitted and in addition that the transferable certificate, which for many has a market value 
close to that of an old truck, is not a preferred economic remedy.</p>
<p>Because the settlement meets the terms of all previous objections, specifically addresses the concerns of appellate courts, and 
is supported by Public Citizen and the Center for Auto Safety, founded by Ralph Nader and currently headed by Clarence 
Ditlow, I expect the court of appeal will give its approval when the day is done and will find that the overall setttlement is not 
perfect, but certainly fair, reasonable and adequate. When that will occur, I do not know.</p>

PICKUP TRUCK at the time of purchase of the NEW GM VEHICLE and provides proof of current ownership (registration 
or title).</p>
<p>2. For the final 18 months, $500 toward the purchase of a NEW GM VEHICLE when used by the CONSUMER (as 
defined in paragraph II.(c)) named on the CONSUMER Certificate.</p>
<p>3. During the final 18 month period, the Certificates shall be freely transferable following endorsement by the CONSUMER, 
provided that upon transfer a Certificate may only be used by a transferee for $250 toward the purchase of any NEW GM 
VEHICLE by the transferee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

final notice pursuant to paragraph VII.7. for the following amounts and shall only be transferable to other departments or 
divisions of that GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, except as provided below:</p>
<p>1. For the first 15 months, $1,000 toward the purchase of a NEW GM VEHICLE when used by the GOVERNMENTAL

of the GM PICKUP TRUCK identified on the GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY Certificate, except an authorized General 
Motors dealer or its affiliated entities, and may be used by the transferee toward the purchase of any NEW GM VEHICLE in 
the same manner as it could have been used by the GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, provided the transferee is the current 
owner of the GM PICKUP TRUCK at the time of purchase of the NEW GM VEHICLE and provides proof of current 
ownership (registration or title).</p>
<p>2. For the next 35 months, $250 toward the purchase of a NEW GM VEHICLE when used by the GOVERNMENTAL 
ENTITY named on the GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY Certificate.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>D. Alternatively, CONSUMERS, FLEETS and GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES with CONSUMER Certificates, FLEET 
Certificates or GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY Certificates (collectively referred to as &quot;Certificate&quot; or &quot;Certificates&quot;) may sell 
or transfer their entire interest in any or all of their Certificates. In the event of such a sale or transfer, each Certificate may be 
exchanged for a Third Party Certificate which shall be issued in the name of the person or entity designated on the written 
request referred to below. The Third Party Certificate may only be used for the unexpired portion of the first 15 months and is 
not transferable further. Any time that elapses between submission of a request for Third Party Certificate and the issuance 
shall be excluded from the unexpired portion of the first 15 months. To obtain a Third Party Certificate, the Certificate must be 
sent to an entity or entities, selected by CLASS COUNSEL and General Motors and approved by the Court, with a written 
request that the Third Party Certificate be issued in the name of the designated person or entity. The written request shall state 
the name and address of the designated person or entity. The charge for issuance of the Third Party Certificate will not exceed 
$5.00 and will be paid by the party seeking Third Party Certificate. The third party named on the Third Party Certificate may 
use it toward the purchase of a NEW GM VEHICLE without proof of ownership of a GM PICKUP TRUCK. The Third 
Party Certificate may be used for $500 toward the purchase of any NEW GM VEHICLE, except that when used, at the 
user's election, with any GM rebate and/or discount, it may be used for $250 toward the purchase of any NEW GM 
VEHICLE.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>E. The following conditions are applicable to all Certificates:</p>
<p>1. No trade-in of a GM PICKUP TRUCK is required to purchase a NEW GM VEHICLE with the use a Certificate.</p>
<p>2. Certificates may only be used toward the purchase of a NEW GM VEHICLE from an authorized General Motors dealer 
of that line and make. Any Certificate may be used toward the down payment on the purchase from an authorized General 
Motors dealer of that line and make. Any Certificate may be used toward the down payment on the purchase from an 
authorized General Motors dealer of that line and make of a NEW GM VEHICLE. Certificates may not be used toward the 
rental or lease of NEW GM VEHICLES.</p>
<p>3. Holders of Certificates are not required to disclose their intention to use a Certificates toward the purchase of a NEW GM 
VEHICLE until they have made their best deal with the dealer.</p>
<p>4. If a NEW GM VEHICLE is ordered by the holder of a Certificate from an authorized GM dealer during the Redemption 
Period, but General Motors is unable to deliver the vehicle within that period, the Certificate will be honored when the NEW 
GM VEHICLE is purchased at the value of the Certificate at the time of the order.</p>
<p>5. One (1) Certificate will be issued for each GM PICKUP TRUCK owned by the requesting SETTLEMENT CLASS 
member. Only one (1) Certificate of any kind provided by this Agreement may be applied toward the purchase of each NEW 
GM VEHICLE.</p>
<p>6. No certificates of any kind provided by this Agreement may be used by any authorized General Motors dealer or its 
affiliated entities toward the purchase of any vehicle from General Motors.</p>
<p>7. Certificates may be used toward the purchase of any NEW GM VEHICLE from an authorized General Motors dealer of 
that line and make in addition to any rebate and/or discount otherwise available to the purchaser at the time of the purchase of 
a NEW GM VEHICLE, except as specifically provided in paragraph III.D. of this Agreement. General Motors and CLASS

<p>&#160;</p>
<hr>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. WHY SETTLEMENT IN LOUISIANA?</strong></p>
<p>That is where our plaintiffs live and by law we are required to bring the case in Louisiana. Also, representatives of three 
groups of lawyers, involving more than 30 law firms, signed the agreement and are proceeding in Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>2. WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR CERTIFICATES?</strong></p>
<p>Any registered owner as of July 4, 1996 of a GM (Chevrolet or GMC) 1973-87 &quot;C&quot; or &quot;K&quot; series full-size pickup truck, 
including general &quot;CONSUMERS&quot;, &quot;FLEET&quot; owners (three or more trucks), and 8CGOVERNMENT&quot; entities.</p>
<p><strong>3. HOW MUCH ARE THE CERTIFICATES WORTH?</strong></p>
<p>Value of certificates change with time and if transferred. Certificates are worth $1,000 towards a new GM vehicle in the first 
15 months for Consumer, Fleets, or Government entities. If the certificate is sold, the purchaser receives a new certificate 
worth $500. For consumers, there is an extended 18 month period when the certificate is worth $500. If sold during these 18 
months, the purchaser's certificate is worth $250. Fleets and Government entities have an extended 35 month period during 
which the certificate is worth $250. Fleets and Government entities cannot transfer their certificates after the first 15 months. </p>
<p><strong>4. CAN THE CERTIFICATES BE USED WITH OTHER REBATES?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. In the hands of the original owners, the certificates can be stacked upon any GM rebate at full value.</p>
<p><strong>5. MUST OWNERS TRADE IN THEIR OLD TRUCKS TO USE THE CERTIFICATES?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>6. HOW LONG ARE THE CERTIFICATES GOOD FOR?</strong></p>
<p>For Consumers, the certificates must be used within 33 months of the mailing of the final notice. For Fleet owners or 
Governments, the certificates may be used for 50 months.</p>
<p><strong>7. WHAT EFFECT DOES THIS SETTLEMENT HAVE ON EFFORTS TO RECALL THE TRUCKS?</strong></p>
<p>None. In 1993, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requested GM recall the trucks. GM refused 
claiming its trucks were as safe as its competitors' models.</p>
<p><strong>8. WHY IS THIS SETTLEMENT BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE?</strong></p>
<p>This settlement is better because everyone can now get a minimum of $100 if they decide to sell their certificate. More 
importantly, the $100 is more than what the class members could have gained through litigation.</p>
<p>This is a &quot;truly transferable&quot; certificate. During the first 15 months, Consumers, Fleets and Government entities just sign the 
certificate and give it to the purchaser who can have a new certificate for $500 issued. During the final 18 months, the 
Consumer simply endorses the back of the certificate and it is good for $250 without the issuance of any new certificate.</p>
<p>The previous certificate was good toward the purchase of any GM trucks -- this one is good toward the purchase of all GM 
vehicles (except Saturn).</p>
<p>The previous certificate was good for only 15 months -- this one is good for 33 months for Consumers and 50 months for 
Fleets and Governments.</p>
<p><strong>COMPARISON: FORMER v. NEW SETTLEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>FORMER SETTLEMENT</i></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Truck owners receive $1,000 certificates good towards the purchase of any GM pickup trucks. </li>
<li>No distinction between ownership entities. </li>
<li>Certificates valid for 15 months by any ownership entity. </li>
<li>Certificates had very limited, if any, transferability. Sale of certificate requires notary. </li>
<li>No requirement for GM to provide funding for safety research. </li>
<li>Because of difficulties with transferability, if truck owners, with the assistance of the $1,000 certificate, could not afford 
or did not choose to purchase a truck, there was no additional compensation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><i>NEW SETTLEMENT</i></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Truck owners receive $1,000 certificates good towards the purchase of any GM vehicles (except Saturn). </li>
<li>Three distinctions among ownership entities: 1) &quot;Consumer&quot;, 2) &quot;Fleet&quot; - someone owning three or more GM trucks, 3) 
&quot;Government&quot; - city, county, parish, state, etc. </li>
<li>Consumer certificates are valid for 15 months at $1,000, and an additional 18 months at $500. Fleet and Government 
certificates are valid for 15 months at $1,000, and an additional 35 months at $250. </li>
<li>Certificate is &quot;Truly Transferable&quot;. No notary is required. During first 15 months, Consumers, Fleets &amp; Governments 
can sign over certificate to a purchaser, who then receives a new certificate worth $500. During final 18 months, the 
Consumer can endorse certificate which is now worth $250 to a purchaser without issuance of a new certificate. </li>
<li>Requires GM to provide $4.1 million in funding for a research project to promote enhanced fuel system safety for 
motor vehicles. </li>
<li>If the truck owners, with the assistance of the $1,000 certificate, could not afford or did not choose to purchase a car 
or truck, they can easily sell their certificate for $100, more than what would have been won through litigation. </li>
</ol>

<hr>


<p><font size=5>T</font>he United States is both the most successful economy and the most complicated legal society in the 
history of the world. Open any newspaper on any day and more than half of all the news concerns the law. 
Full time legislatures, plus Congress and numerous federal agencies, produce volumes of rules. In short, 
there are laws, rules, and legal regulations that impact everyone's life on a daily basis. The legal and 
political system of the United States is heavily influenced by campaign contributors, those with real power 
over politicians, and the resulting special interest legislation is routinely added to unrelated legislative 
proposals as &quot;riders.&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>ore and more law is being generated which is only fully understood by those few lawyers who are 
specialists in specific areas. For example, despite the fact that tax law is a recognized specialty, there is no 
one in the United States who has read all of the U. S. tax code and all I.R. S. regulations. There are 
legions of subspecialists the area of taxation from personal taxation to leasing, estate planning and the 
perpetuation of subchapter S corporations. Law, like medicine, has become a specialty of information 
providers. Finding the &quot;right lawyer,&quot; a specialist with substantial knowledge and experience, is what you 
want when you need a lawyer. </p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>inding the &quot;right lawyer&quot; is a great challenge, even for lawyers themselves. When you have a medical 
problem, a doctor will help decide whether you need specialized care and assist in providing immediate 
and necessary care. On the other hand, when you are in need of legal assistance, you are on your own. 
Few states recognize a vast range of legal specialties and outside of the Yellow Pages there is little readily 
available information to help in the selection of an experienced lawyer. Unfortunately the advice offered by 
bar associations, such as The State Bar of California, is so general that it is of little value. After you have 
read this article and the specific advice provided here, open The State Bar of California's advice on how 
to hire a lawyer <a href="http://www.calbar.org/2con/3conhowc.htm">[http://www.calbar.org/2con/3conhowc.htm]</a> and compare. It is a well intended piece but 
it is so general and lacks specific recommendations that it is not very helpful. The purpose of this article is 
to provide specific advice and to explain how lawyers find the &quot;right&quot; lawyer. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>ften, people begin looking for a lawyer to represent them when they are confronted with a crisis. They 
may be dealing with a family death, serious injury, divorce, or criminal charge. Many times it is easiest to 
choose a lawyer who is friendly and supportive, without conducting research into his or her background 
and experience. </p>
<p><font size=5>C</font>hoosing a lawyer simply because he or she is understanding may lead to later dissatisfaction. While the 
Yellow Pages or a television advertisement may be a good place to start, keep in mind that such sources 
are merely that and only a starting place. </p>
<p><font size=5>L</font>awyers should be selected for their expertise and experience in specific categories of cases. The &quot;right 
lawyer&quot; is the person who has substantial experience handling a case very similar to yours, who can and 
will take action at once. She or he does not have to &quot;look into it,&quot; &quot;think about it and call you back&quot; or 
&quot;check the most recent court decisions.&quot; The &quot;right lawyer&quot; knows what to do immediately, acts effectively 
and with little wasted effort or wasted expenditures of your money. </p>
<p><font size=5>Y</font>our search for the &quot;right lawyer&quot; should be expected to take several days. Although it is a challenging 
process, this commitment will yield important rewards. Begin as soon as possible because there may be 
statutes of limitations or other deadlines that may be critical. In some cases you have only a limited 
window of opportunity to take legal action. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>hink carefully about the legal services you require. You may need on-going, regular legal advice from 
someone who has experience advising individuals or businesses in your line of work. Other attorneys have 
particular experience in drafting contracts or wills, representing estates or working through land 
development or zoning-related issues. Many lawyers practice law for a lifetime and never set foot in a 
courtroom because their work is primarily consultative and oriented toward planning. Other attorneys 
focus on providing remedies that require litigation, and are experienced in appearing before juries and 
trying complex civil and criminal cases. The bottom line is that there are many, many lawyers. You just 
need one. The &quot;right&quot; one. </p>
<h3>Finding Legal Specialists</h3>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you were forced to bet your home on the outcome of an athletic event between two players in boxing, 
tennis or golf, you would do a substantial amount of homework. You would do a literature search, call 
coaches, talk with players, call Las Vegas to learn what the professionals had to say, and find videotape 
on film of previous matches. The same approach applies when it comes to finding the &quot;right lawyer.&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>L</font>awyers find the &quot;right lawyer&quot; by networking with the members of their profession who have experience 
in related areas. After making multiple calls they develop a &quot;short list&quot; of attorneys with special expertise. 
There are many ways that you can achieve the same goal. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you are reading this article on the Internet, you have access to search engines, such as Netscape's 
Netsearch, Infoseek, Excite or Lycos that allow you to enter &quot;class action,&quot; &quot;defective products,&quot; toxic 
chemical&quot; or the like to locate lawyers with special experience. Check the law lists on the World Wide 
Web. These lists are growing daily. You need URL capability through Mosaic or Netscape both of which 
are freely available. One of the best is The Seamless Web. Also see, Yahoo, Einet, P-Law and West's 
Law Directory, which has a website listing lawyers which is searchable. Check out the home page of The 
Alexander Law Firm. Look for a lawyer with the same dedication, commitment, experience and record of 
success in the types of case that you have that is shown there. In addition, America Online's Court TV 
provides a database of lawyers and if your local newspaper is online, a search of that database can 
provide information about lawyers with special background and experience. In using any of these sources 
look for qualifications and experience that are factual. </p>
<p><font size=5>E</font>very community has lawyers who are experts in specific areas of the law. Finding a specialist requires 
more than asking friends and relatives for their recommendations. Unless they have extensive experience 
with the legal community, their advice has to be considered in the context of their background in retaining 
lawyers. To rely merely upon advice from friends and relatives may greatly limit your prospects unless they 
are involved in a line of work that is related to your problem. Artists and decorators know who does the 
best job of picture framing in town. For example, if your brother or sister has been served with divorce 
papers and in looking for a lawyer you learn of two family law specialists and a &quot;brilliant trial lawyer.&quot; 
Remember, the key is networking. Call the &quot;brilliant trial lawyer&quot; and ask him or her who they would hire if 
they were sued for divorce. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you have a family or business attorney upon whom you rely, your work is all the easier, but watch out. 
If your lawyer refers you to someone in his/her firm, this person may not be your best choice. Consider 
that person as someone to be added to your short list but nonetheless follow the guideline and suggestions 
you will find here before you make a final decision. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he best place to start is your county law library. Here you will find a number of directories and source 
books which will help you develop your &quot;short list.&quot; But since everyone starts with the Yellow Pages, 
understand what you can learn there. The Yellow Pages are paid advertising. The bigger the ad, the larger 
the volume of common cases handled by that lawyer. This may be what you need for a common or garden 
variety case, but no major corporation picks its lawyers out of the Yellow Pages. Ignore the hype and 
look for facts confirming experience you can call upon. </p>
<p><font size=5>Y</font>our County law library and most main libraries contain a national listing of attorneys published by 
Martindale-Hubbell, one of the best all-around sources of information. The Martindale-Hubbell Law 
Directory lists lawyers in practice by state and city. You'll be able to learn about attorneys' particular 
backgrounds, areas of practice, bar activities, honors, articles, and other aspects of their practices. But, 
more importantly, Martindale-Hubbell rates lawyers for their legal skills, ethics, and professionalism. While 
the rating system is not perfect, Martindale-Hubbell conducts confidential surveys of local judges and 
lawyers. Few very good lawyers are unrated. </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>artindale-Hubbell also publishes the Bar Register of Preeminent Lawyers in the United States, which 
categorizes only those lawyers with the highest ratings, and organizes them into 34 specialized fields of 
practice. Here you may find some of the best informed attorneys in your community or state. </p>
<p><font size=5>N</font>othing beats experience, and you can find expert trial attorneys in the Association of Trial Lawyers of 
America's Desk Reference. It contains a special section called &quot;Life and Sustaining Members.&quot; This list is 
an outstanding resource of the top trial lawyers in the United States. ATLA awards Sustaining 
Membership to attorneys who have made significant contributions to further the goals of the association 
and who are recognized for their expertise in the practice of trial law. Sustaining members must have 
practiced for ten years or more, have experience trying ten or more jury cases, have served as an ATLA chapter officer, board member, section chair or state delegate, and have been an ATLA member for at 
least five years. Reach ATLA, located in Washington, D.C., by calling 202-298-6849 if the library does 
not carry their directory. </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>any trial lawyer and consumer attorney organizations conduct peer review of studies of their members 
experience and recognized those with special experience. For example the author is recognized for his 
experience as a trial lawyer in the fields of products liability, professional negligence, insurance bad faith 
and public entity liability cases by the Consumer Attorneys of California. CAOC publishes a list of 
California lawyers with recognized experience in trial law, general personal injury, product liability, 
professional negligence, workers' compensation, criminal defense, family law, appellate, public entity 
liability and insurance bad faith. While this list does not make any evaluation of the competency of an 
individual lawyer and does not certify the expertise of the recognized lawyer in any specialty, it does make 
one important contribution to your search. It provides independent recognition of actual experience for 
you to consider, as opposed to accepting an attorney's self-proclamation. Once again, the key is 
experience and for that reason this list is invaluable. For a copy of the Recognition of Experience List try 
CAOC's website at <a href="http://seamless.com/consumer">http://seamless.com/consumer</a>, write Consumer Attorneys of California, 980 9th 
Street, Sacramento, CA 95814-2721, 800.767.2852 916.442.6902 or fax 916.442.7734. Other state 
Trial Lawyer Associations are also opening websites which will be helpful. </p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>or more information on experienced trial attorneys, consult the membership directory of the National 
Board of Trial Advocacy, founded in 1980 and located in Boston. It is the only board of trial specialists 
approved by the American Bar Association, and the only national organization certifying civil trial lawyers, 
based upon substantial competency as a trial advocate. It is highly respected because everyone certified 
by the NBTA must meet objective criteria and no one was &quot;grandfathered&quot; into membership as a founder. 
Certification requirements include experience in at least 15 trials, evaluation by judges and opponents, 
peer review, and written examination. If your library does not have a copy of the NBTA directory, you 
can reach this organization for a list of NBTA members in your state by calling 617-720-2032. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>o check an attorney's most recent record of courtroom successes, jury verdict reporting services are 
available. Every law library contains these commercial services subscribed to by lawyers, insurance 
companies, and others interested in what is taking place in courtrooms on a daily basis. A jury verdict 
reporter details the results of cases and provides information concerning lawyers, the particular facts of 
cases, testifying experts, and the result, usually on a regional, statewide and national basis. Some of the 
services provide annual compilations listing lawyers and experts who have appeared in jury trials over a 
given year. Because the reporting of trial results is unofficial and voluntary these reports are not perfect or 
complete. </p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>or many people &quot;cold calling&quot; is not easy, but you may gain valuable information if you contact some of 
the local legal community's leaders. The local bar directory contains the names of current and former bar 
presidents, the heads of bar association committees, and editors of legal publications. It will also give the 
names of the directors of continuing legal education programs or CLE as it is commonly known. Attorneys 
must attend a specific number of hours of continuing legal education each year to keep current their license 
to practice under the rules of many state supreme courts or state bar associations. Those lawyers who 
organize these educational programs are excellent contacts who can refer you to attorneys who have 
expertise in your line of work. The best lawyers in fields unrelated to your problem know who they would 
hire. Birds of a feather not only flock together, but they read legal decisions, legal newspapers, know the 
current county scuttlebutt, and chat with their colleagues. When they need help, they know who to call. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you know a specialist in Chicago, but need a lawyer in Santa Barbara, call the Chicago expert. The 
best lawyers in any state know the best lawyers across the country. Many times lawyers from different 
states work together on cases. Your expert in Chicago may not know the right lawyer in Santa Barbara, 
but he/she can put you in contact with someone in San Jose or Los Angeles who will have worthwhile 
recommendations. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s you are developing a &quot;short list,&quot; do not hesitate to call either a current or former county bar president 
and to ask whether you would be making an error selecting any one of your nominees to represent you in 
a particular kind of case. It would be rare for you to receive a recommendation for any one particular 
individual, but you may learn whether an attorney has retired, suffered a major illness or limited her or his 
practice. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n smaller communities, the same information may be obtained from the presiding judge of your local 
court. Keep in mind that while judges seek to be independent, they are also, in many states, elected. To 
be reelected requires popular support of the bar and the electorate. Do not be surprised if the local 
presiding judge declines to comment, but don't be afraid to ask. Experienced trial lawyers have used this 
technique from time to time. Keep in mind that you may learn more by what a judge does not say, than by 
what he or she says. As long as you're cordial, explain that you have a problem and ask for any guidance 
that can be provided, there are very few judges that will turn down your request. Ask for comments on 
your &quot;short list.&quot; &quot;Would I be making a mistake hiring either A, B or C? Or, &quot;of A, B and C who has the 
most recent experience in defective products cases?&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you have access to computerized data bases and your local newspaper is online, run a newspaper 
search of the people on your short list. Prominent lawyers who have taken on challenging and difficult 
cases are regularly mentioned in newspapers. More and more newspapers are on-line these days through 
Compuserve, Prodigy, America On Line, or other services. </p>
<p><font size=5>N</font>umerous county bar associations provide low-cost referrals, which in large part provide advice on 
routine matters. For a fee of about thirty dollars, these services will arrange a consultation with an attorney. 
Many lawyers contribute their time to this endeavor, although a large percentage of the members of 
referral panels are younger attorneys. Large bar associations, usually found in major metropolitan areas, 
require lawyers have some minimum level of experience in a particular field of law before assigning them to 
a referral panel. &quot;Minimum&quot; means just that. You most probably will not find the county's leading expert 
offering referral panel services. Bar associations in small communities normally use a rotational method of 
assigning their lawyers to requests for assistance by the public. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>o not expect to find the &quot;right lawyer&quot; by calling a local bar association. These are voluntary 
organizations designed to serve the needs of attorneys and they do not wish to alienate any of their 
members. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>o use a referral service to meet with a lawyer to determine whether or not you should be making a claim 
and learning what steps are immediately necessary to protect your rights. It is also an excellent opportunity 
to gain experience talking with a lawyer and practicing your negotiating skills. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>nterviewing the Specialist There is no substitute for a face to face meeting when you are trying to select 
an attorney. You will not only learn whether a lawyer has the necessary expertise, but also whether you 
could form a comfortable working relationship with him or her. </p>
<p><font size=5>C</font>all each attorney on your &quot;short list&quot; to see who would be available to be interviewed about taking on 
your case, and what the fee schedule would be for this meeting. Some law firms provide clients with a 
brochure, press clippings, or a curriculum vitae, which details a lawyer's education, achievements, and 
experience. Ask for any information available on the lawyer or your subject matter, and review it carefully. 
This is the time for comparison shopping. Read for substance and compare the background and work 
experience of one lawyer with another before you call for an appointment. </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>hen you call for the appointment, describe your problem in twenty words [&quot;I need an estate plan; my 
wife and I have a net worth of $1,000,000.&quot; &quot;My husband filed for divorce, he's an engineer, we have two 
children and we own two houses.&quot; &quot;I work for the city maintenance department with strong chemicals and 
was just diagnosed with leukemia.&quot;]. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>t your meeting you should give a clear summary of your situation and the services you are seeking. It is 
helpful to bring a one page summary of all the relevant information, including dates, times, names and 
addresses and which provides basic &quot;who, what, where, when, why and how&quot; information. For an 
example of basic information a lawyer will need open How To Become A Client Of The Alexander Law 
Firm [http://seamless.com/talf/].. Come prepared with documents that help tell your story, such as 
correspondence, photographs, accident reports, police reports and medical records. By examining this 
information the lawyer can quickly determine if she or she has a conflict of interest, in which she or he 
represents someone whose legal interests are in opposition to your own. </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>hen talking with a lawyer pretend you are talking with your auto mechanic and ask the same questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>How bad is it? </li>
<li>How soon do I have to do something? </li>
<li>Have you done this before? </li>
<li>Are there any options? </li>
<li>What are the odds of getting it fixed? </li>
<li>At what price? </li>
<li>When will it be done? </li>
<li>Who is going to do the work? </li>
<li>When can you get started? </li>
</ol>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you or a family member have been injured, you may discover that your case requires prompt action. 
There are critical deadlines, called &quot;statutes of limitations,&quot; that restrict the time you have to file a claim 
against the party responsible for your injury. In most states the rules adopted by the legislature requires all 
claims for personal, property or business injury be filed within two years. A few states, such as California, 
require all such cases be filed with the court within one year of the injury and if a governmental entity is a 
potentially responsible party, an administrative claim must first be served on a designated city or county 
official within six (6) months of the incident and you must file a claim before you can file suit. These rules 
vary from state to state and worse yet, how and when they come into play also varies. It can be 
unnecessarily complicated and has been made that way as a result of the influence of big business in 
passing legislation and in selecting cases to appeal. In most states if you file one day late, you lose. So, 
always move quickly to preserve your rights. Acting quickly also serves to preserve important evidence 
that may otherwise disappear. Every major insurance company and corporate defendant begins 
investigating potential claims immediately. So should you. Evidence should be preserved instanter [an old 
but wonderful legal word that best explains how important this advice is] and in some cases a professional 
engineer is required rather than an investigator. Discuss what kind of investigation would be appropriate 
and whom the lawyer recommends. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>n experienced lawyer's record should speak for itself. Check the results this attorney has obtained for 
clients who needed the same kind of services. Learn if he or she generally works with a certain category of 
individuals or businesses, since specialization is to your advantage. Ask a trial attorney how many cases 
like yours she or he has both tried, won, lost or settled. Do not be afraid to ask for a copy of a trial brief, 
settlement conference, or pre-trial statement that was filed with the court so better acquaint yourself with 
the type and quality of the attorney's work. </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>any attorneys will work with other lawyers, their partners and employees who are called &quot;associates&quot; 
on your case It is important to know what their qualifications are, check what their level of involvement 
would be, and whether the person you are interviewing would be the lead attorney or decision-maker on 
your case. Find out who will be working on your case on a day-to-day basis. Ask to meet the legal staff, if 
they have not been introduced to you. Remember that when you are in a hospital you see the doctor 
usually once a day, but it is the nursing staff that provides hourly care. The same is true in the law office. 
Lawyers perform direct services, but they also give instructions and orders to others. Find out who those 
people are and what they do. </p>
<p><font size=5>Y</font>ou should ask what course of action the lawyer suggests in your case, and be wary of an answer that 
contains lots of assurances but lacks concrete steps and a range of time the tasks would require. 
Determine what procedures will be followed to make sure all time deadlines will be met in your case. 
Many cases require the testimony of an expert, who is a specialist in a given field, many times a university 
professor, medical doctor, economist, accountant, or scientist. You should ask whether your case would 
be assisted by an expert, what kind of expert should be considered, which experts your attorney 
recommends, and when they should be retained. How much will they charge and who pays is discussed 
below. </p>
<p><font size=5>K</font>eep in mind that if you are going to litigate, your attorney will have to tell your story to a judge and a 
jury. You should try to imagine what kind of impression the attorney would make on them, and how 
convincingly he or she would present the facts of your case. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s a routine practice, determine how you and the attorney would resolve how your case should proceed. 
Does his attorney want to make all the decisions or does she or he enjoy shared decision-making? If there 
is a disagreement, are they open to second opinions and what happens if you do not get along. How 
would a change of counsel be accomplished? You should determine whether the attorney carries adequate 
professional liability insurance for a case like yours. In addition, ask if he or she has ever been sued for 
malpractice, how many times and more importantly the outcome. No professional should be offended if 
you explain that you are bringing up these unlikely possibilities as a matter of policy. </p>
<p><font size=5>N</font>o interview would be complete without finding out what your own responsibilities would be. Ask if 
there are any tasks you would be involved in, and what your role in decision making would be. Most 
clients make the mistake of expecting the lawyer to initiate communication with them and most lawyers 
intend to do so and desire having a well informed client. But without a formal structure, it will not happen. </p>
<p><font size=5>U</font>nderstand that initiating communication is your responsibility and do not expect to be able to accomplish 
it by telephone. Many lawyers are frequently out of the office, appearing in court or taking depositions. 
Busy lawyers do not remain in their offices all day. Court appearances, arguing motions, interviewing 
witnesses, taking depositions into the dinner hour, traveling to meetings outside the office, attending 
continuing education programs and bar meetings are common. They will routinely not be there to accept a 
random call and may not be able to call you back when you will be available. Telephone tag does not 
accomplish your goal of being informed. </p>
<p><font size=5>B</font>e sure that you talk about the best ways to keep each other updated. Telephones do not work nearly as 
well as regular face-to-face meetings or scheduled telephone conferences. Plan on follow-up meetings 
with your lawyer at agreed upon times, perhaps every 30 days at first and thereafter as needed. Ask for 
copies of correspondence and documents filed in court. If you do not understand what they mean, save 
those questions for your next meeting. You must stay informed, but you do not want to abuse your 
welcome, even though you may be very anxious about your case. </p>
<p><font size=5>C</font>onsider your lawyer in the same manner as you do your doctor. After you see a physician it is common 
for him or her to order tests, prescribe medication or to take some other action, but always you are asked 
to come back in a certain period of time. The doctor does not make the appointment. You do. Follow the 
same practice with your lawyer and arrange for follow-up meetings. One of the best ways to do this is by 
scheduling telephone conferences. Ask the lawyer, legal secretary or other person responsible for 
scheduling to set a meeting by phone when the lawyer expects to be in the office. This will help you avoid 
telephone tag and increases the probability of a successful exchange of information. </p>
<h3>Understanding the Fee Agreement</h3>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you think you have found the &quot;right lawyer,&quot; you will want a written fee agreement. Unless you sign a 
written fee agreement at the outset, the probability of your having an amicable conclusion to your 
relationship is zero. Ask for a copy of the attorney's fee agreement. As with all documents, make sure that 
you understand it fully before you sign it. No reputable attorney will pressure you to accept a fee 
agreement on the spot. Be sure to read <a href="legalfee.shtml">Understanding the Legal Fee Agreement: Consumers' Rights in the 
Legal Marketplace</a>. </p>
<h3>Creating a Working Relationship</h3>
<p><font size=5>A</font>fter your interview, take time to consider whether you would be comfortable in working with this 
person as your lawyer. Ask yourself whether or not she or he gave you clear and direct information. Will 
they be available in an emergency? Consider if the attorney spoke knowledgeably and with a minimum of 
legal terms. Think about whether this lawyer understood and shared your goals. As a client will you be a 
co-participant or will the lawyer be making all the decisions? Did the attorney give you his/her home phone 
number if you have an emergency? </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he importance of creating a comfortable working relationship with your lawyer cannot be 
underestimated. The road to obtaining the legal services you are seeking may be long, and it will take a 
considerable amount of teamwork to get there. If you make the commitment to find an experienced lawyer 
with whom you can work jointly, you will be well on your way to the best possible result. </p>

<p>The Attorney General of Missouri and the General's consumer protection staff were the impetus for 
this article, which in large part has adopted an outstanding brochure on consumer fraud prepared for 
citizens of Missouri. Because of this valuable contribution to consumer education The Consumer 
Law Page salutes the Missouri AG in its leadership on this issue. </p>
<p>Unfortunately consumer fraud laws differ from state to state and for a California lawyer to attempt to 
set forth all the law as it varies from state to state is a monumental undertaking. We did not do that 
here. What is here is a general primer on consumer law scams and what you should protect yourself 
against. This article is a general statement of consumer law issues and obviously is not legal advice. 
That can only come from a lawyer admitted to practice in your state, after you have explained to him 
or her all the facts concerning your particular legal issue. </p>
<p>For additional information on a wide range of consumer topics open The Consumer Law Page 
section entitled Brochures, where articles on automobiles, banking, credit, career, employment, 
funerals, general consumer, health &amp; medical, investing, loans, mortgages, products &amp; services and 
timeshares can be found. </p>
<p>Exercising and affirming consumer rights starts with you, providing you are informed and alert. </p>
<p>To learn the specific laws in your state on the issues discussed here, always check with your local 
city or county consumer agency administrator, legal aid office, state or country bar association, 
county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's office for the specific laws 
in your state on a particular issue. </p>

<h2>Tom Nolan: Criminal Defense Lawyer of Choice:</h2>
<h3>The &quot;Right Lawyer&quot; When You Are Charged With a Crime in California or the Western

San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.

</p>
<p>&quot;If Tom tells you he's going to prove something . . . you can pretty well figure its in the bank. I guess there are some attorneys 
who would welcome the challenge of trying a case against him. But for others it's, Oh no!'&quot; -Jack Marshall, Chief Trial 
Deputy, Santa Clara County D.A.'s Office &quot;Ingenious tactics . . . .&quot;L.A. Times&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best money [can] buy&quot; -Randall Sullivan, author, The Price of Experience.</p>
<p>&quot;. . . larger than life reputation as the San Francisco Peninsula's premier criminal defense lawyer.&quot; -San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>&quot;He is first of all a big hearted, passionate person . . . in court, that personal attribute is amplified and the jury and judge are 
really sold on the idea that he believes what he is saying and the rightness of his client's cause.&quot; -Santa Clara County Superior 
Court Judge Conrad Rushing</p>
<p>Thomas J. Nolan, a nationally recognized criminal defense lawyer, brings nearly thirty years of trial and appellate experience to 
bear for his clients. Known for his ability to obtain success under the most adverse conditions (he once took over a complex 
trade secrets case on the first day of trial and won), Tom approaches each case with the tactical skills of Ghengis Khan, a 
great understanding of human nature, both judges and juries, with an eye towards total victory. </p>
<p>Located in the Silicon Valley, Tom Nolan and his premiere criminal defense firm, Nolan and Armstrong, have substantially 
shaped the practice of high-tech criminal defense in California. From obtaining a dismissal in one of the first major software 
trade secret case, People v. Magnusson, to obtaining acquittal after a four and one half month jury trial in the Intel/ULSI case, 
Tom's successful defense of numerous Silicon Valley notables facing complex business crime prosecutions is legendary. </p>
<p>Author Randall Sullivan captured Nolan's trial presence in the renowned Billionaire Boys Club case, describing Nolan's 
closing argument as moving, &quot;several members of the [jury] panel to tears.&quot; Sullivan continued, &quot;[w]hat worked best for Nolan 
was his decision to place a chair on the courtroom floor only a few feet away from the jury box so that he might sit at 
eye-level with those who would judge his client.&quot; The prosecutor in that case consistently summarized Tom's approach with 
one word: &quot;formidable.&quot;</p>
<p>Recognized around the country by fellow criminal defense lawyers and a former president of California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, Tom Nolan maintains a thriving, aggressive practice in both state and federal court. He is certified as a Criminal Law 
Specialist by the State Bar of California, he has served as a member of the Criminal Law Advisory Committee of the State 
Bar; and he was recently inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers. </p>
<p>Tom has been recognized by the Best Lawyers in America as one of the top criminal defense lawyers in the country. In 
addition, he is a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit and a member of the ABA Liaison committee for the Criminal 
Justice Section, having practiced criminal law exclusively since receiving his J.D. from the University of California at Davis in 
1970. </p>
<p>Tom is also a consulting professor at Stanford Law School, teaching classes on White Collar Crime, and Advance Criminal 
Procedure, among others. In addition he lectures throughout the country on criminal defense practice, trial practice and trial 
ethics. He has also been an expert witness on the responsibility of criminal trial lawyers as well as effective assistance of 
counsel. In this capacity he testified as an expert concerning the reasonableness of fees in the Delorean matter. </p>
<p>Tom has developed a law practice that is devoted exclusively to the defense of the citizen accused. Working with partners 
Mike Armstrong and Dan Barton, and associate Rebecca Laibson, the firm comprises a full-service criminal defense firm, 
handling all levels of criminal cases, from the most technically complex, white collar cases to forensically complicated 
homicides to misdemeanor and drunk driving offenses. </p>
<p>Tom has been extremely successful in sheltering clients from adverse publicity and public exposure. The firm also provides top 
quality, discreet representation to low profile clients. The attorneys of the firm assist individuals who face police questioning as 
part of a criminal investigation, who may be called as witnesses, who are being prosecuted in criminal courts, or who need

<h2>Companies that Cheat:</h2>
<h2>Stop Corporate Rip Offs - Blow the Whistle on Crime </h2>
<p>When you stop your employer form stealing from the U.S.Government, the False Claims Acts of both the United States and 
California recognize your significant contribution to honest, decent conduct by providing major rewards - incentives for you to 
do what is right and to encourage citizens to come forward to protect the government from cheats and thieves.</p>
<p>These special lawsuits are known as qui tam actions and are encouraged by the government to uncover fraud,thefts and sharp 
practices by corporations and companies ripping off state and federal government. A qui tam case is brought by an individual 
through a private attorney, after providing the government with an opportunity to proceed directly. </p>
<p><strong>Frauds and False Claims</strong></p>
<p>A false claim can be selling something that is not delivered, making false reports about the quality of good, failing to properly 
test products, and any schemes intended to cheat, defraud or otherwise steal.</p>
<p>Thousands cases have been filed against businesses that rip off taxpayers, and many have been settled. Nearly $1 billion has 
been repaid to the U.S.Government through the efforts of honest employees, who in return have received nearly $200 million 
in compensation for telling the truth and stopping corporate crime and fraud. </p>
<p><strong>Rewards and Incentives</strong></p>
<p>Rewards paid by the government range from 10% to 30% of the recovery, providing you are the FIRST to blow the whistle. 
The percentage paid to the whislte blower depends upon whether the government actively participates in prosecuting the case 
or if the whistle blowers private attorney shoulders the burden of litigation. </p>
<p>The goal of the law is to uncover unknown frauds. If the fraud has already been reported, a subject of testimony before a 
court or legislative proceeding and is public knowledge, it does not qualify as a potential whistle blower claim.</p>
<p><strong>Other Whistle Blower Rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No public disclosure until after a lawsuit is filed.</li>
<li>If an employer seeks revenge you can sue for all your damages, and can recover punitive damages.</li>
<li>Your attorney is paid only if you win. </li>
<li>Attorney fees are paid by your employer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>
<p>If you have any knowledge of a false claim being made by your employer against any agency of the government, contact an 
experienced law firm and arrange for a confidential telephone conference to discuss your options. DO NOT USE YOUR 
EMPLOYER'S EMAIL OR TELEPHONE SYSTEM TO DISCUSS MAKING A WHISTLE BLOWER CLAIM.</p>

<hr>
<p><font size=2>The Consumer Law Page is pleased to honor this work by attorney Michael Hugo. His compelling analysis comparing the misconduct of 
vaccine and breast implant manufacturers is commended to you. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>Mr. Michael Hugo, a respected advocate, legal scholar and caring practitioner, stands in the vanguard of American lawyers who are 
advocates for the public good. He serves as a leader in the plaintiff's committee on breast implant litigation and is highly regarded for his 
conscientious commitment to the cause of justice for victims of corporate abuse. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>This article was first published by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America in its 1996 Boston Convention Syllabus where it was 
discovered by The Consumer Law Page. We are extremely pleased to have Mr.Hugo's permission to reprint his work here. We salute his 
distinguished efforts on behalf of the victims of breast implants and we commend him as a leader in the legal profession to be emulated by all 
aspiring attorneys. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>It is indeed appropriate that he makes his office in historic Faneuil Hall, a stone's throw from the site of the Boston Massacre and the home of 
America's most distinguished lawyers whose clients included a new nation at its birth. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>To Mr. Hugo and his colleagues fighting for the cause of women and children victimized by medical devices, vaccines and drugs, our highest 
compliments for your vigilant efforts on the side of human justice. Godspeed in your efforts to achieve justice for the victims of corporate 
abuse. You are a tribute to the legal profession. </font></p>

<p><strong>I.	Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>If pertussis vaccine is administered to children who have pre-existing conditions or have had a severe reaction to a previous 
administration, the result can be devastating. Pediatricians must be ever vigilant. For manufacturers of vaccine to allay the fears 
of pediatricians by suggesting that DTP is safe is one thing; for them to do so under the auspices of a reputable peer reviewed 
journal, by authors who fail to disclose their financial interest, is quite another. </p>
<p><strong>II.	Revealing Critical Conflicts of Interest Regarding DTP</strong> </p>
<p>One such journal, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) ran an article several years ago.<sup> [1]</sup> In an editorial 
run in the same issue, the writer sought to convince readers that pertussis vaccine encephalopathy was a &quot;myth.&quot; <sup>[2]</sup> The 
editorial was authored by James D. Cherry, M.D., the leading defense expert witness in vaccine litigation. Dr. Cherry failed to 
disclose his significant financial ties to Lederle Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, Connaught Laboratories, Parke-Davis &amp; 
Company, or Eli Lilly &amp; Company -- the major DTP vaccine manufacturers in this country. Similarly, Dr. Edward Mortimer, 
of Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, failed to disclose his ties to the industry in the underlying article that appeared 
in the same issue. <sup>[3]</sup> JAMA authors must sign a statement that they have no financial interest in the subject matter, including 
&quot;consultancies&quot; between the author and the manufacturer of the drug being reported. There is an editorial policy of JAMA 
concerning ethical and financial conflicts of interest. In any publication, the integrity of the articles is a direct function of the 
integrity of the authors. As peer reviewers for JAMA, Drs. Cherry and Mortimer<sup> [4]</sup> have been entrusted to ensure the 
scientific integrity of the works they review for that journal. The obligation of a journal's editorial board members is to come 
forward with information concerning potential ethical violations prior to the publication of an article in the journal if they know 
of the existence of such conflicts. </p>
<p>Dr. Cherry has been actively reviewing DTP cases on behalf of the pharmaceutical manufacturers since the early 1980s. He 
was a collaborator in the UCLA/FDA study carried out in the late 1970s. That study revealed an incidence of 1:1750 seizures 
and an additional 1:750 hypotensive hyporesponsive episodes within 48 hours following DTP administrations. The study was 
originally funded to examine 50,000 administrations of DTP, but was terminated after 15,752 DTP and 784 DT 
administrations. The study was plagued by an unacceptably high incidence of seizures in the first 1500 doses. Dr. Larry 
Baraff, the principal investigator of that study, reported to Wyeth Laboratories on September 6, 1978, that DTP vaccine has 
produced 5:1500 (1:300) generalized seizures, all in infants under six months of age which is below the usual lower limit 
defined for febrile seizure disorders. There had been 2:1500 (1:750) incidents of hypotensive hyporesponsive shock 
collapse.<sup>[5] </sup></p>
<p>Following the completion of the UCLA/FDA study, Dr. Cherry was named associate editor of the Report of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, known as the Red Book. He served under Dr. Jerome O. Klein, 
the editor, and Dr. Vincent A. Fulginiti, the chairman of the committee, and is a current member of the JAMA editorial board. </p>
<p>At about this time, in December of 1981, Dr. Cherry was contacted by Patrick Hast, a lawyer representing Parke Davis in a 
DTP case. So began his participation in hundreds of lawsuits on behalf of defendants being sued for vaccine liability.<sup>[6]</sup> Dr. 
Cherry recently began a presentation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with an unpublished slide of an elephant that 
had various parts depicting the factions in the vaccine injury controversy. He selected the anus as the lawyers.<sup>[7]</sup> In 1988, Dr. 
Cherry estimated that he was making about $50,000 per year testifying for manufacturers, based on an hourly fee of $200, in 
about 90 cases. Today. he charges over $260 per hour and has reviewed hundreds of cases.<sup>[8]</sup> </p>
<p>In addition to these sums, Dr. Cherry has attained $400,000 in grant funds for UCLA, much of which is applied to his 
research, expenses, and salary. Although this sum is applied to his department at UCLA, Dr. Cherry eventually receives the 
benefit of most of it. Dr. Cherry's department has also recently received $450,000 in unrestricted funds he calls a &quot;gift,&quot; from 
Lederle. This was so designated to allow Dr. Cherry free access to more of the money. </p>
<p>When confronted with his failure to declare this money on his JAMA financial disclosure form which he signed prior to 
publication of his editorial, Dr. Cherry, a member of Lederle&#185;s editorial board, told a television reporter, &quot;I don't know what I 
signed.&quot; Following the airing of the television news story on WHDH Television in Boston, the Los Angeles Times, Dr. 
Cherry's home-town newspaper, viewed the WHDH-TV film and contacted Dr. Cherry for further comment. From the time 
WHDH spoke with him to the time the Los Angeles Times contacted him, Dr. Cherry amended his response, telling the Los 
Angeles Times, &quot;When I signed this thing, I actually thought about it and read it sort of carefully because I know this is a 
sensitive area. As it turns out, I did think about this. I thought this is generic, not really specific.&quot; </p>
<p>The rationale behind the &quot;generic&quot; comment is explained in the Los Angeles Times as Dr. Cherry's belief that his article did not 
concern Lederle's product in specific, but referred to pertussis vaccines in general. Because he is a consultant for Lederle, 
Cherry did not believe it was necessary to declare the existence of the funding. He stated, &quot;[t]his particular editorial relates in 
no way to a specific manufacturer, it relates to the pertussis vaccine.&quot; Lederle, one of two United States manufacturers, is by 
far the largest supplier of DTP in this country. While WHDH-TV has discussed Dr. Cherry's ties to Lederle only, Dr. Cherry 
has also taken grant money and consulted for Wyeth Connaught, Parke Davis, Merrell Dow, Burroughs-Wellcome, and 
Connaught Canada. Additionally, Dr. Cherry has shared his manuscripts with the legal department of at least one 
manufacturer prior to submission for peer review and publication. How can he claim that he is not in conflict? </p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer, one of the co-authors of the Griffin study, has also failed to reveal a conflict of interest. Dr. Mortimer has 
testified that he participated in many case reviews for DTP manufacturers. He failed to disclose that, as a member of the AAP 
Red Book Committee, he participated in a policy decision to testify on behalf of the manufacturers in DTP suits. He testified 
under oath that: </p>
<p>Several years ago, because of the increasing number of litigation over DTP, members of the so called Red Book Committee . 
. . agreed in a sense that we would sort of divide up the cases to try to help the manufacturers in these lawsuits, and therefore 
I and a number of my colleagues agreed to serve as expert witness[es].<sup>[9] </sup></p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer has gone on at least three trips to Japan on behalf of Wyeth Laboratories. Like Dr. Cherry, he has appeared in 
litigation for most of the manufacturers, and has lectured to Wyeth's team of defense attorneys on how to better defend 
themselves against the vaccine-damaged children. Dr. Mortimer has also consulted for Lederle on a large scale. He has 
lectured to their legal staff and assisted them with defense strategies. In addition, he has lectured lawyers for Connaught and 
Parke Davis in similar strategy sessions. Dr. Mortimer failed to disclose this to the JAMA in the submission of his manuscript, 
notwithstanding the position of trust bestowed upon him as a member of peer review staff. </p>
<p>The casual mention accorded the endowment of the chairs occupied by Drs. Griffin and Ray, as Burroughs-Wellcome 
Scholars in Pharmicoepidemiology at Vanderbilt University is also an incomplete statement of the truth. The article should 
have mentioned that Burroughs-Wellcome is the largest supplier of DTP vaccine to the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that Dr. Griffin, notwithstanding her connection to that DTP manufacturer, is also a member of the 
Institute of Medicine&#185;s Committee to Review the Adverse Consequences of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines. This is supposed 
to be an impartial and uninfluenced committee. During his prefatory remarks at the public meeting of the committee held on 
January 10, 1990, the chairman of that committee, Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, stated: </p>
<p>I wanted to emphasize that the committee is dedicated to seeking the scientific basis of evidence and will not be influenced by 
political, financial, or legal considerations.<sup>[10] </sup></p>
<p>These are not doctor versus lawyer issues. These are doctor-patient issues. Politics and self interest must never take a part in 
such considerations. </p>
<p><strong>III.	Cover-Ups Involving Silicone Breast Implants</strong> </p>
<p>Similarly, and more recently, the manufacturers of silicone breast implants have affected the medical literature in an attempt to 
color the studies in a light most favorable to their litigation agenda. Some of America's largest companies have spent millions of 
dollars attempting to persuade the public that breast implants do not cause disease despite the growing body of evidence 
demonstrating that silicone breast implants do, in fact, cause harm. The manufacturer&#185;s position is based on two seriously 
flawed population-based studies that purport to show a lack of causal connection between breast implants and disease. </p>
<p>Similar to that of the vaccine manufacturers, this campaign has two purposes. The first is to improve its position in the litigation 
over breast implants by attempting to persuade the public that implants are safe. The second, and more devious reason, is to 
divert public attention from the fact that they sold a medical device intended for long-term implantation in the human body 
without any testing to determine whether it was safe or defective. Indeed, the information they possessed raised serious 
questions about the safety of implants, but the companies elected to put profit before public safety. Contrary to the 
manufacturers' media oriented assertions, there was and is compelling scientific evidence that silicone breast implants cause 
atypical diseases in women -- diseases that can be seriously debilitating and come with tremendous cost to the individual and 
society. Most of this information comes from studies conducted by the manufacturers before implants were marketed. 
Moreover, the breast implant controversy is another tragic example of the way in which women have been injured by 
inadequately tested products. </p>
<p>In 1962, Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Co. and Corning, Inc., introduced the first silicone breast 
implant. Prior to the introduction of liquid silicone gel implants, women had liquid silicone injected directly into their breasts. 
These injections caused, in most if not all cases, severe complications. The liquid based silicone gel implant was intended to 
remedy the problems caused by direct injections of silicone. </p>
<p>These implants, promoted as being fit to last a lifetime, were constructed of a rubberized silicone shell surrounding a silicone 
gel which, in finished form, is 80 to 85 percent liquid silicone. By the late 1960s, silicone manufacturers were aware that this 
silicone gel would bleed out of the implants and migrate throughout the body. Indeed, in 1965, one Dow Corning scientist 
wrote &quot;we know that something is getting out of the bag . . . .&quot; And by 1980, the manufacturers were aware that silicone gel 
would pass through breast milk. The manufacturers never informed the public of these or other findings that raised further 
serious questions about the safety of implants. </p>
<p>The chemical makeup of silicone gel implants was virtually identical to the chemical makeup of liquid silicone that was injected 
into the breasts of women. The known complications associated with liquid silicone injections included atypical immune 
diseases that the researchers at the time termed &quot;human adjuvant disease.&quot; </p>
<p>Silicone gel implants did not remedy the problems caused by direct injections, and even caused other equally serious 
problems. The shell was fragile; it permitted the silicone to leak out of the implant and into the women&#185;s bodies and rupture 
under normal use. The gel, largely made up of fluid, escaped from the shell and moved throughout the woman's body. </p>
<p>Dow Corning was not alone in its discoveries. By the 1970s, all of the manufacturers had become aware of a growing leakage 
and rupture problem. Indeed, as plastic surgeons began to see complications in their patients -- complications that appeared 
remarkably similar to those seen with liquid silicone injections -- they expressed their alarm to the manufacturers. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding these complaints, the manufacturers assured the plastic surgery community that its concerns were 
unwarranted. They repeatedly restated their position that silicone was biologically inert and was safe for use, despite having no 
long-term studies to support this claim. </p>
<p>Shockingly, while making those representations, the leading manufacturer, Dow Corning, was engaged in a secret program, in 
conjunction with its parent Dow Chemical Co., to utilize liquid silicone as pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, and insecticides. 
Indeed, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dow Corning conducted a series of research studies that concluded that silicone 
does stimulate the immune system. This is in contrast to the position they now assert that liquid silicone from their implants 
does not stimulate the immune system. </p>
<p>At the same time, Dow Corning and Dow Chemical, to whom the other manufacturers looked for leadership, were also 
investigating the use of liquid silicone as insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. The same liquid silicone found in breast 
implants succeeded in killing cockroaches. The public, and specifically the women who were being induced to purchase 
implants, were never told of these studies, nor the potentially toxic properties of the silicone. </p>
<p>Again, Dow Corning was not alone in its failure to look into possible problems with the implants. One of its competitors, 
Heyer-Schulte, had been an early manufacturer of intracranial hydrocephalic shunts. Prior to introducing those shunts, 
undeniably medically necessary products, Heyer-Schulte spent three years studying potential consequences. It, like other 
manufacturers, did no such research on breast implants. </p>
<p>The manufacturers did not maintain any registries of implanted women so that their health and complication rates could be 
tracked over the years. Such registries are common among manufacturers of potentially hazardous products. Michelin Tire 
Co. and Chrysler could not accomplish a meaningful product recall without maintaining such registries. Surely, a manufacturer 
of an implantable medical device should be held to a standard at least as rigorous as that of an automotive manufacturer or a 
software development company. </p>
<p>Even though the manufacturers put implants on the market without any long term testing of their safety, the manufacturers had 
ample evidence of local complications long associated with implants -- evidence they chose to ignore. For example, problems 
of contracture (severe hardening of the breasts), rupture, bleeding, and migration of the silicone to various parts of the body 
were well known to the industry. When a medical device is implanted into a human body, a capsule forms around the implant 
as part of the body's attempt to wall off the implant. Such a reaction is not abnormal. With breast implants, however, the 
manufacturers quickly learned that the capsules were different. In many women (estimates as high as 80 percent), the capsule, 
consisting of scar tissue, would tighten and compress the implant, causing severe pain, hardening of the breasts, deformity, 
and, in some instances, rupture of the implants. </p>
<p>Coupled with the contracture was the development of chronic inflammation. All breast implants bleed, allowing silicone to 
escape into the body, even if the implant shell does not rupture. At first the manufacturers denied that the implants bled, but 
when faced with uncontroverted evidence that liquid silicone was escaping from the implant shell, they changed their marketing 
strategy, asserting that &quot;low bleed&quot; was beneficial. Again, they had no medical or scientific evidence to support such a claim. </p>
<p>But the local complications do not stop with contracture and chronic inflammation. The shell of the implant was fragile and 
became increasingly fragile in use as silicone fluids passed through the shell and the shell interacted with body fluids. Doctors 
often had a difficult time determining whether implants ruptured due to hardening of the breasts, and rupture rarely showed up 
on mammography. </p>
<p>The consequences of ruptured silicone breast implants are serious and deforming. The surgery to remove the ruptured implant 
and the attendant loose gel can result in serious disfigurement because the surgeon often must scrape and cut away large 
amounts of otherwise viable breast tissue in order to excise the gel. </p>
<p>In recognition of the potential harm caused by liquid silicone, the manufacturers admitted that ruptured implants should be 
removed. The migrated silicone has been found, in large amounts, in lymph nodes, knees, arms, and even, in a recent case, in 
spinal fluid. One woman found silicone gel in her elbow, gel that had migrated from her ruptured Heyer-Schulte implant. In 
fact, her plastic surgeon has testified that he removed a half Dixie cup full of silicone from her arm. Repeat surgeries to remove 
continuing evidence of silicone have led to further disfigurement not to mention serious financial demands on women. </p>
<p><strong>IV.	Autoimmune Conditions and Breast Implants</strong> </p>
<p>As painful as the disfigurement may be, an even more serious problem exists -- silicone breast implants cause severe and 
debilitating autoimmune conditions. </p>
<p>In the early 1960s, medical literature reported diseases and conditions caused by liquid silicone injections. Many doctors who 
have seen and attempted to treat women with these conditions believe that this atypical autoimmune presentation is the result 
of a chronic immune response to the silicone that the body is exposed to when the implant bleeds or ruptures. Indeed, from 
the early manufacturer studies to more recently published studies, the silicone gel and the fluid contained therein has been 
proven to be a powerful booster of immune response. </p>
<p>While the silicone fluid and gel have been proven to have their own immune effects, even more disturbing is research 
conducted by both the manufacturers and independent scientists demonstrating the breakdown of the gel in the body and 
attendant formulation of even more toxic substances. Recent studies show that the gel degrades into other substances, 
including silica. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to silica leads to a variety of autoimmune 
conditions. Because it may take years for the body to break down silicone into its constituent silica, symptoms in many women 
may not surface until six to ten years or longer after implantation. This is similar to the latency period for asbestos-related 
diseases, which at times did not appear for decades. </p>
<p>Recent controlled epidemiology studies show that women with breast implants have elevated antibodies, which are the most 
common markers (indications of) for autoimmune disease. These studies used blood samples from exposed women and 
compared them to double blinded controls and have led to the conclusion that the serologic hallmarks of autoimmune disease 
are found in women with implants and not in women without implants. Similarly, one researcher has recently published 
DNA/genetic susceptibility. </p>
<p>The symptoms of this atypical disease process include: sicca symptoms (climically determined dry eyes, dry mouth, and dry 
vagina); joint pains; muscle pains; and cognitive dysfunction. In its more serious presentation, the disease includes central 
nervous system impairment (often as a result of an immunological response), kidney failure, and even death. The unique group 
of symptoms seen in women with breast implants is not seen in the general population. </p>
<p>From animal studies, which demonstrate convincingly and unassailably that silicone produces chronic immune response, to 
well-conducted clinical studies, which report on the results of examinations and evaluations of thousands of women with breast 
implants, to controlled epidemiology studies proving elevated antibodies in implanted women, the scientific evidence 
overwhelmingly shows that silicone breast implants cause systemic disease. Moreover, the data submitted to the Claims Office 
in Houston showing that one in ten women with breast implants suffers from an atypical disease further bolsters this 
conclusion. </p>
<p><strong>V.	Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>In 1991, facing a growing public outcry over implants and their consequences, the president of Dow Corning Wright Co. 
wrote, &quot;the cover-up is going well.&quot; Since 1991, the manufacturers have deliberately engaged in a campaign designed to 
misdirect public attention and to cover up the very real and serious consequences that women with implants suffer. The 
centerpiece of the manufacturers' efforts has been the design and funding of several misleading statistical studies. These studies 
were narrowly designed to look for a limited set of classical diseases, rather than for the atypical disease process now 
recognized to exist in thousands of women with breast implants. The studies were reviewed, not by the company scientists, 
but by the company lawyers in an effort to ensure that the results would support the manufacturers' position in litigation. </p>
<p>Neither the much-touted Harvard Nurses' Study nor the oft-cited Mayo study looked at the atypical disease process that the 
literature says is caused by implants. Indeed, neither even address the issue of whether silicone causes atypical disease and 
neither look at the issue of latency. In fact, the Harvard study of 876 women included one woman who had her implants for 
thirty days. More shockingly, however, that study also included at least two women whose implants preceded the date of 
invention of the device, according to the text of the study. These two studies were carefully designed not to find the obvious, 
or the truth. </p>
<p>The manufacturers' attempts to cover up the real science is consistent with their pattern of covering up the real consequences 
of their products. </p>

<h2>10 Common Consumer Law Violations that a Class Action Lawyer Can 
Make Them Wish They Never Committed</h2>
<p>The National Consumer Law Center in Boston is the nation&#185;s leader in providing legal research, legal publications and direct 
support for lawyers representing consumers. The following list of common consumer law violations was prepared by the 
NCLC. </p>
<p>This common illegal conduct can and does lead to significant penalties against wrongdoers in cases prosecuted by private 
attorneys, but only when consumer seek and obtain informed legal advice and representation from attorneys with experience 
in consumer law who can make a difference. </p>
<p>1.	Attorneys letting collectors use their name in collection letters without first adequately reviewing the debtor&#185;s file. Attorneys 
are now covered by the Fair Debt Collection practices Act, and this and other violations can result in the collection attorney 
being liable for up to $1,000 plus actual damages plus attorney fees. See NCLC's Fair Debt Collection Manual. </p>
<p>2.	Credit bureaus&#185; failure to prevent the same error from recurring in the consumer&#185;s file. As many as 50 million consumers 
have inaccurate credit records, and reporting agencies failure to take appropriate steps to permanently correct errors can 
result in a consumer&#185;s recovery under the FCRA for actual and punitive damages and attorney fees. See NCLC's Fair Credit 
Reporting Manual. </p>
<p>3.	Loan flipping and rip-off second mortgages. Frequent flipping of consumers into new loans often makes a bad deal even 
worse. Second mortgages related to debt consolidation or home repairs may contain outrageous terms. Consumer attorneys 
are finding new ways to stop foreclosures, cancel loans and recover hefty damages and attorney fees for these and other 
examples of lender overreaching. See NCLC's The Cost of Credit: Regulation and Legal Challenges. </p>
<p>4.	Sellers jacking up the cash price for high risk debtors. This and other types of hidden finance charges (such as junk fees, 
fictitious broker&#185;s fees, or bogus insurance) violate TILA and state credit statutes, and can lead to $1,000 or more in statutory 
damages, actual damages, and attorney fees. See NCLC's Truth In Lending Manual and The Cost of Credit Regulation and 
Legal Challenges. </p>
<p>5.	Pursuing collection contacts, lawsuits, garnishments, or repossessions despite the bankruptcy stay or discharge. Violations 
of the automatic stay or bankruptcy discharge can lead to actual and punitive damages and attorney fees. See NCLC's 
Consumer Bankruptcy Law and Practice Manual. </p>
<p>6.	Car lessors withholding interest on security deposits or mis-disclosing early termination penalties, purchase options, 
trade-ins, taxes, or warranties. These and related practices can all violate the Consumer Leasing Act and can result in $1,000 
statutory damages, actual damages and attorney fees. See NCLC's Truth in Lending Manual. </p>
<p>7.	Faulty notice of or commercially unreasonable conduct of a repossession sale. These are just some of the wide array of 
defenses to an auto loan deficiency action that can result in a net recovery of thousands of dollars for the consumer and, in 
many cases, attorney fees for the consumer&#185;s attorney. See NCLC's Repossession and Foreclosure Manual. </p>
<p>8.	An astonishing percentage of used car sales involve reset odometers, salvaged vehicles, or lemon laundering! These 
violations can lead to $1,500 minimum damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. See NCLC's 
Odometer Law Manual and Sales of Good and Service Manual. </p>
<p>9.	Contracts providing that a lease, future service contract, or other transaction cannot be canceled or that a dealer is not 
subject to the oral promises of its employees. These and similar attempts to limit consumer rights are unfair and deceptive, and 
can lead to consumer recoveries of multiple, statutory, or punitive damages and attorney fees under a state UDAP statute. See 
NCLC's Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices Manual. </p>
<p>10.	Requiring a spouse to co-sign a loan. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act limits a lender&#185;s ability to require a spouse to 
co-sign a loan and also requires lenders to promptly notify the consumer of any denial of credit. Violations lead to actual 
damages [such as the amount of the co-signer&#185;s obligation], punitive damages, and attorney fees. See NCLC's Credit 
Discrimination Manual. </p>
<p>In the cases listed above the NCLC has prepared in-depth legal research memoranda and sample class action pleadings that 
can provide consumers with significant recoveries, multiple and punitive damages and force the wrongdoers to pay the 
attorney fees of consumers. </p>
<p>Superlative manuals, which are noted above, contain legal research, practice suggestions and form complaints. All available 
from the NCLC, 18 Tremont Street, Boston, MA 02108, phone 617.523.8089, fax 617.523.7398. In addition attorney 
consulting services are also available. </p>

<h2>Over-the-Counter Herbicides Pose a Significant Threat of Soft-Tissue 
Sarcoma, Leukemia and Lymphoma</h2>
<h4>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h4>
<hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">The Alexander Law Firm</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com], a medium size law firm specializing in individual and class action litigation arising from negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, mass accident, environmental and fraud cases on behalf of consumers and small businesses. The firm holds Martindale-Hubbell's highest rating and is recognized in the List of Preeminent Law Firms in the United States.

<hr>

<p>In October, 1996 CNN reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had conducted a test of lawn herbicides and 
found that after outdoor spraying the level of contamination found INSIDE homes was TEN to ONE HUNDRED times 
stronger than what was found outside. Brought in on shoes and by pets, the floor and carpet concentrations were readily 
picked up by children from direct dermal contact as well as orally. In fact the video portion of the story showed four babies 
crawling on the floor and thoroughly mouthing every toy.</p>
<p>This report is indeed sobering, especially when it is known that one popular herbicide for many years contained high levels of 
dioxins.</p>
<p>On our webpage is a case report concerning Joe Pickering who died from a soft tissue sarcoma - very rare in a 40 year old - 
as a result of being exposed to dioxin laced &quot;Weed B Gon&quot; manufactured by Chevron and sold as part of its Ortho line of 
gardening products. Mr. Pickering, a 38 year old high school teacher, died in 1994. During the early 1970s he was employed 
by Chevron at its pesticide bottling plant in California and was exposed to Weed-B-Gon. The main ingredients of this 
pesticide during the early 1970s were 2,4 D and 2,4,5 TP. </p>
<p>A search of local homes in the South San Francisco Bay area produced twenty year old cans of Weed-B-Gon that when 
tested proved to be contaminated with dioxins and furans. Mr. Pickering died of a soft-tissue sarcoma which has been 
identified in medical literature as being associated with the contaminants found in this common household pesticide. </p>
<p>This is not the first case in which we have found &quot;archived&quot; samples of chemical carcinogens sitting on garage shelves. We 
successfully used the same protocol in our leukemia cluster in Northern California where we proved that dioxin laced 
pentachlorophenol was the cause of four leukemia illnesses in employees of a small lumber mill. In that case again the 
contaminated sample came from twenty year old buckets of Woodlife.</p>
<p>Weed B Gon found on the store shelf today is a much different formulation than what was sold in the past, but the untold story 
is that Weed B Gon using silvex was sold across the U.S. through 1980 and it was heavily contaminated with dioxins and 
furans. </p>
<p>Gardeners who regularly used the product and therefore had a chronic exposure are progressing towards a time when soft 
tissue sacrcomas, leukemia, and Non-Hodgkins Lymphomas, among others, may be presenting. The latency period is on the 
order of 10 to 20+ years. That's what we learned from the dioxin exposure to the residents of Seveso, Italy.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that many who will suffer from these diseases may never learned that it is because of chronic toxic exposures 
that occurred years ago. </p>
<p>That silvex is dangerous is confirmed in EPA's file on the product that was the focus of regulatory action beginning in the 
mid-70s. I have been to EPA and have read most of this file. The industry fought regulation very hard and for many years, but 
then in the late 70s simply gave up, and EPA banned 2,4,5 TP from public use. Obviously the time and money spent in fighting 
regulation allowed the manufacturers to clear their warehouses and shelves of 2,4,5 TP and ship all available stock 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The public needs to know that the old can of Weed B Gon on the back shelf in the garage may be loaded with dioxins and 
should never be touched, let alone used. </p>
<p>The public also needs to know that anyone who has used Weed B Gon for years who has been diagnosed with a soft tissue 
sacrcoma, leukemia, or Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma must take legal action at the earliest possible date in order to avoid having 
their legal rights barred by the passing of their state's statute of limitations. </p>
<p>Tests are available to determine the nature and extent of a person's exposure to 2,4,5 TP and mass spectroscopy can be used 
to verify the actual signature of dioxins in the body. </p>

<h2>Adoption Fraud in California:</h2>
<h3>Children Adopted Before December 31, 1983</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>
<p><hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">The Alexander Law Firm</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com], a medium size law firm specializing in individual and class action litigation arising from negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, mass accident, environmental and fraud cases on behalf of consumers and small businesses.

</p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm has unique experience helping parents and their adopted children in special cases where county 
social workers have withheld important information which has caused emotional and financial disruption to families. The details 
of our casework and a special article on adoption fraud can be found on our websites. </p>
<p>Under California law parents have a lifetime duty to maintain a child who is unable to maintain himself or herself. </p>
<p>If your family is facing major medical, psychiatric, or residential care bills for your adopted child because of a failure to 
disclose information before the adoption, we may be able to help you.</p>
<p>If your child was placed with you by a California county adoption agency before December 31, 1983, and if you did not 
receive a full report in writing of your child's medical and psychological history, development, family life and birth parents' 
background, you should complete the following questionnaire and arrange a meeting with us to discuss your options. </p>
<p>To hold a county responsible for an adopted child's special needs a claim that complies with the requirements of California's 
Government Code must be served on the County Clerk within six months [or one year for a late claim] of the parent's learning 
of fraud or misrepresentation by adoption workers. </p>
<p>If a parent learns of fraud, but does not file a claim or files late, California law is brutal: both the parent's rights and the child's 
rights are lost forever. Make no mistake. There is no second chance for your child. This law is brutal in the extreme.</p>
<p><strong>If you suspect adoption fraud, do not contact social workers without first understanding the law</strong>. </p>
<p>If any critical information was concealed from you or if you suspect that has been the case, under California law you must file 
a claim against the county the was responsible for the adoption within six months of discovering fraud or misrepresentation. </p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more, please complete the following questionnaire. With The Alexander Law firm there are no 
charges unless, and until, we prove you were defrauded and secure a recovery that is acceptable to you and approved by the 
Court for your child. All of our work is on a contingency basis. Recoveries for a child are supervised by us in conjunction with 
the Superior Court to assure the child receives full benefits. As long as our clients follow our advice if there is no recovery, 
there are no fees, no costs, no charges. We guarantee it in writing.</p>

<h2>Asthmatic Children with Seizures:</h2>
<h3>Theophylline May be the Cause</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>
<p><hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.

</p>
<p>Bronchodilators, can help prevent asthma attacks, and are safe and effective when used properly, but one specific 
bronchodilator, Theophylline, is known to have a therapeutic range that is extremely narrow and requires careful monitoring.</p>
<p>When doses of this Theophylline were not carefully monitored, an overdose could have readily occurred causing seizures and 
brain damage in children. </p>
<p>The hazards of Theophylline were known as early as 1981 but the manufacturer concealed this information from pediatricians 
during the 1980s. </p>
<p>As a result some children who were prescribed Theophylline during the 1980s and who had seizures while treated with this 
bronchodilator have gone undiagnosed. </p>
<p>Today these children suffer from disabilities caused by Theophylline. If your daughter or son:</p>
<ul>
<li>has not yet reached the age of majority</li>
<li>has asthma, </li>
<li>was treated with prescription or over-the-counter bronchodilators</li>
<li>suffered a seizure</li>
<li>has had learning disabilities of unknown origin</li>
</ul>
<p>you should take action now. </p>
<p>Under California law a person injured as a child has until his/her 19th birthday to file a legal action for injuries against a 
manufacturer responsible for causing their injury. </p>
<p>In other states the statute of limitations is generally longer, but on average the time for filing suit is two years after reaching 
adulthood, except in California. </p>
<p>The important point is that unless suit is filed before the running of the statute of limitations, your daughter or son will forever 
lose their right to take action.</p>

<hr>
<p>While it is often said that the &quot;past is prologue,&quot; a testimonial, endorsement or result in a particular case 
does not constitute a promise, prediction or guarantee regarding the outcome of any other case. For 
those whom we represent The Alexander Law Firm commits its best efforts. Those efforts over the 
years are reported here. Each case was dependent on a multiplicity of factors and unique facts. 
Because of many different factors, results always will differ from case to case. For that reason the 
results that we obtained in these cases are no guarantee that we can again achieve the same results in 
any future case. In fact to understand what we achieved in these cases we have provided a substantial 
amount of information, including references to news articles and court files, so anyone can evaluate 
and make their own determination of the result and our record. There is only common factor in all the

<h3><a name="concluded">CONCLUDED CLASS</a> ACTIONS </h3>
<p><strong>Allstate Insurance Agents</strong>. With our co-counsel we represent 1,809 California Allstate Insurance 
agents who had not been reimbursed for the cost of maintaining Allstate offices under R830, R1500 or 
R3000 employment contracts between January 1, 1990 and April 30, 1996. Although these agents 
legally were employees of Allstate, Allstate required them to personally pay for the costs of operating 
company offices under its Neighborhood Office Agency program. Under the California Labor Code, 
employees cannot be forced to pay for an employers' business expenses as a condition of 
employment. In January, 1995 the court certified this case as a class action and final settlement was 
approved on March 20,1996. With the settlement of this case Allstate simultaneously decided to 
convert all employee agents to independent contractors in order to operate its agent network in 
conformance with California law. Of the total of 2,288 agents, 304, representing 13% of the agent 
force, have chosen to opt-out of the settlement and to pursue individual claims against Allstate. Under 
class action procedures, the filing of a class action tolls every class ' statute of limitations and the 
opt-out agents are now able to go forward at this late date to attempt through their individual attorneys 
to litigate with Allstate over reimbursement terms and to contest Allstate's changing their status from 
employees to independent contractors. Although on this latter issue, in response to the objection of 
several agents, the National Labor Relations Board has concluded that Allstate's decision was made 
for lawful business reasons. By mid-June, 1996 1,334 of 1,809 claimants had received 
reimbursements of $6,170,000. In addition to receiving reimbursement of office operating expenses, 
one of the benefits of the settlement is the recognition of the agent's ownership interest in his book of 
business one year from the date of conversion to independent contractor status. Without the settlement 
an agent would have had to wait five years from conversion under Allstate's previous rules in order to 
be able to sell his or her book of business acquired prior to conversion. Many agents are expected to 
sell their book of business to other agents in the Spring of 1997. This case is the second case for 
insurance agents that we concluded in 1996 [see Kohler and Orlando v. Nationwide]. In re Insurance 
Agent Cases I and II, J. C. C.P.Nos. 2984 and 2985, Alameda County Superior Court before Hon.

<p><strong>Bausch &amp; Lomb Contact Lenses</strong> A court-approved settlement of a consumer class action 
settlement against Bausch &amp; Lomb was announced on August 1, 1996. Under the settlement Bausch 
&amp; Lomb will pay up to $68 million in cash and products to 1.5 million buyers of the company's 
disposable lenses. Many wearers will receive from $25 to $50 in cash and $25 to $50 in coupons 
under the settlement as a result of a class-action filed in May 1994 which alleged that the company 
sold the same product under different brand names at widely varying prices and engaged in a 
fraudulent marketing scheme in order to gain market share in the disposal lens market. The result was 
that some consumers paid much more because they believed they were getting different lenses. 
<em>Roberts v. Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc.</em>,U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Western 
Division, No. CV-94-C-1144-W. See Wall Street Journal, November 2, 1994 and August 2, 1996

<p><strong>Chrysler Minivans</strong>. We are one of eight firms in the United States that filed suit seeking correction 
of defective rear hatch door lock failures in nominal impacts for 3,300,000 owners of Chrysler 
minivans. Actions were filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court, U. S. District Court for the 
Northern District of California, and state courts in New York, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama. 
Because door locks are not subject to any federal motor vehicle safety standard, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration had limited authority to force a recall absent Chrysler's 
willingness to do so. Chrysler announced a &quot;service action&quot; and its intention to replace all such locks 
on March 27, 1995 the day before our motion for class certification was set to be heard in Santa 
Clara County Superior Court. These related class actions resulted in a negotiated settlement under 
which Chrysler became contractually bound to all owners of 1984 through 1995 Chrysler minivans to 
replace existing rear hatch door locks. Chrysler estimates that the total cost of this contractual recall is 
approximately $120,000,000. <em>Mann v. Chrysler</em> Corporation Santa Clara County Superior Court 
Action number CV 746017. The provisional settlement agreement of July 21, 1995 was given final 
approval by Judge Charles A. Legge on November 30, 1995, <em>Stuart Hanlon, et al v. Chrysler 
Corporation</em>, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 95-2010 CAL. 
Despite several objections, Judge Legge held that the settlement was &quot;fair, reasonable and adequate.&quot;

<p><a href="cases.html#chemical"><img src="richchem.gif" alt="Richmond Chemical Plant Aerial View" align=right hspace=0 width=200 height=263></a> $180,000,000 Final Settlement. <strong>The Richmond Toxic Cloud</strong> 
class action litigation, Contra Costa County Superior Court, arose 
from the explosion of a tank car of oleum, concentrated sulfuric acid 
and sulfuric trioxide, in July, 1993 at the sulfuric acid manufacturing 
plant operated by General Chemical Company in Richmond, 
California. General Chemical was the sole provider of sulfuric acid 
to Chevron's Northern California gasoline refinery. In the afermath 
of the explosion, which sent 12 tons of oleum into the atmosphere, 
63,000 Californians were exposed and thousands were seen at 
hospital emergency rooms for chemical exposure. As one of seven 
firms appointed by the Court to manage this massive toxic chemical 
class action, our mission was to prove medical causation and the full 
range of injuries caused by this disaster and to serve as Chair, 
Science/Medical Causation Committee. As an active member of the 
Class Action Executive Committee and the Plaintiffs' Management 
Committee, which was responsible for overseeing and prosecuting this combined class and mass tort 
action, our responsibilities included formulating, planning and executing the organization of the plaintiffs' 
proof of scientific and medical evidence including the retention of a mutli-disciplinary team of 
meterologists, atmospheric scientists, and computer modeling scientists to conduct a detailed study of 
the sulfuric acid plume caused by the venting of acid into the atmosphere, participation in the execution 
of the computerized windfield and plume study to identify and replicate the path and concentrations of 
the cloud of sulfuric acid as it dispersed, selection and screening of class representatives for the Model 
Complaint, retention of experts in toxicology, occupational medicine, pulmonology and allergy 
medicine, participation in focus group presentations, preparing and appearing with our 14 class 
representatives at their depositions and active involvement in extended settlement discussions leading 
to the final recovery of $180,000,000. In addition we conducted an aerial reconnaissance and 
inspection of General Chemical's sister facility in Wilmington, Delaware which revealed barns and 
sheds for housing tank cars, unlike the Richmond facililty where loading and unloading of tank cars 
occurred in the open. The settlement,which was negotiated during the winter and spring of 1995 was 
first announced on June 20, 1995 and reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury, 
Associated Press and PR Wire on June 21, 1995. The final approval hearing was held on October 
27, 1995. The Court rendered its final decision confirming the settlement on November 13, 1995. 
This outstanding result occurred as a result of a team effort that successfully proved outrageous 
misconduct in the heating of the tank car which exploded, carefully selected class representatives, 
diligently marshalled medical and scientific evidence and created a computerized program for reporting 
exposures and injuries for each of the 63,000 claimants. For more information see In re GCC 
Richmond Works Case, Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 2906, Contra Costa County 
Superior Court, Martinez, California. </p>
<p>$200,000,000 estimated total recovery for 33,000 owners of 1987-90 <strong>Nissan minivans</strong> which were 
the subject of three recalls because of engine failures and fires before The Alexander Law Firm filed 
suit in April 1993. On February 2, 1994, one week before the hearing on plaintiff s motion to certify a 
national class action, Nissan negotiated a settlement of the class action, stipulated to the certification of 
a national class, and resolved a federal investigation by the National Highway Traffic and Safety 
Administration by voluntarily agreeing to an unprecedented buy back of 33,000 vans at fair market 
value [$5,000 to $7,000]. <i>Johnson v. Nissan Motor Company Inc., U.S.A.</i>, Santa Clara County 
Superior Court No. 730558. Wall Street Journal, February 4, 1994, page A2. San Jose Mercury,

<p>Co-lead <strong>Alviso Asbestos Class Action</strong>. This is the first medical monitoring class action certified in 
California. Settled October, 1994 on behalf of a Hispanic neighborhood of 2,500 who have been 
exposed to asbestos-laden dust from adjacent businesses. </p>
<p><a href="cases.html#train"><img src="train2.gif" alt="photo" align=left hspace=0 width=300 height=200 heigth="200"></a> Spearheaded $15,500,000 recovery for the 
victims of the pollution of the <strong>Sacramento River</strong> 
of July, 1991 when a 19,000 gallon tank car 
derailed at the Cantara Loop spilling metam sodium 
and releasing methyl isothiocyanate, a respiratory 
irritant, affecting 3000 residents of the Dunsmuir 
and Lake Shasta area. Major responsibilities, as a 
member of the ten law firm steering committee for 
this class action, involved proof of medical 
causation, selection of experts in epidemiology, air 
dispersion, toxicology, occupational medicine, 
pulmonary medicine and psychiatry, and trial preparation. Active member of four attorney team that 
negotiated the final settlement. See San Francisco Chronicle, July 29, 1993. San Francisco Superior 
Court, <i>Sacramento River Spill Litigation</i>, Judicial Council Coordination Nos. 2617 and 2620. </p>
<p>$48,000,000 national recovery in the <strong>Sears Automotive Repair Fraud</strong> action on behalf of 
consumers defrauded by Sears commission sales program for auto repairs. Filed in U.S. District Court 
in San Francisco and successfully concluded August, 1992. Participated as support counsel on the 
Plaintiffs Steering Committee. <i>In re Sears Automotive Center Consumer Litigation</i>, Action No. 
C-92-2227, Honorable Robert H. Schnacke. </p>
<p>In <i>Plotkin v. General Electric</i>, The Alexander Law Firm led the nation in charging General Electric 
with defrauding the American public in the sale of <strong>Energy Choice Light Bulbs</strong> which were claimed 
to be energy efficient, required less electricity and would preserve the environment. In actuality, the 
100 watt replacement bulb was simply a dimmer 90 watt bulb and was sold for twice the price of a 
standard 100 watt bulb. Embarrassed by the public exposure of misconduct, General Electric readily 
settled this national class action. Forty-four million Energy Choice Light Bulbs sold over a two year 
period. Settlement provides for national reimbursement by special coupons to all consumers refunding 
overcharges. <i>Plotkin v. General Electric</i>, U.S District Court, Northern District of California, Action 
No. C-92-4447, Honorable Barbara Caufield. See San Francisco Chronicle, October 28, 1993, 
page 2. </p>
<p>In <i>Evarkiou v. Ford Motor Company</i>, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 
C-93-0844-SAW, an action on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of 429,000 owners of 
1988-91 3.8 Liter <strong>Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental</strong>, we sought relief as a 
result of power steering hoses that were prone to rupture due to a design defect resulting in loss of 
steering and possibly fires. This action sought recovery for property damage and injunctive relief. 
Discovery established that engine fires were caused by improper service work that resulted in 
dislocation of the power steering hoses and improper repositioning by mechanics. In a unique 
settlement, in which no class member released any claim, Ford agreed to issue a Technical Service 
Bulletin addressing this problem and to sell power steering hoses only in special boxes containing the 
TSB, all appropriate warnings and installation instructions with the appropriate heat shield and tie 
straps at a 30% discount. In addition the TSB was issued to all dealers and associations of mechanics. 
Total value of the benefit conferred is approximately $2,000,000. </p>

<h3><a name="current">CURRENT CLASS</a> ACTION AND MASS TORT RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<p><img src="3stacks.gif" align=left hspace=0 width=265 height=181> <strong>Columbus Dioxin</strong>. In January, 1996 a class action suit 
was filed against the City of Columbus and the Solid 
Waste Authority of Central Ohio for the operation of a 
trash burning power plant which has been reported to 
have produced 10% of all dioxin emitted by municipal 
incinerators in the United States. The trash plant received 
municipal waste directly from refuse handlers where it was 
shredded and then carried by conveyor belts to metering 
bins and air blown into boilers to drive three steam turbine 
generators, which in turn generate electricity purchased by 
the City of Columbus for use in its operations, and electricity for sale to the public. In 1992, the trash 
incinerator was found to be emitting dioxin into the atmosphere at a level which resulted in ambient 
levels at least 17 times greater than urban background, and 85 times greater than rural background. 
Subsequent ambient air analysis confirmed that The Facility was emitting dioxin at levels far greater 
than that allowed by EPA and ATSDR guidelines. The lawsuit seeks compensation for diminished 
property values and to require medical monitoring of exposed residents. <i>Myers, et al v. City of 
Columbus, a municipal corporation, and the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, a solid 
waste management district</i>, United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern 
Division. </p>
<p><strong>GM Pickup Gas Tank</strong>. On July 3, 1996 a $5 billion dollar settlement of this national class action 
was announced. The <a href="http://www.seamless.com/alexanderlaw/txt/reserved.html">complete details</a> of the settlement can be found on this web site. The new 
settlement meets all the objections raised to a previous class action settlement for GM truck owners 
which was reversed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and by the Texas Court of Appeals. All 
lawsuits against GM filed in federal courts across the United States were transferred to the U. S. 
District Court in Philadelphia under federal Multi-District Litigation rules. The Alexander Law Firm 
represents 278 of 283 plaintiffs before the Honorable William H. Yohn, Jr. Our case was the only one 
entitled to be heard under federal court jurisdiction rules because it is based on the U. S. 
Magnusson-Moss Act for breach of warranty, which requires 100 plaintiffs to prosecute a class 
action. Our contribution to the legal team focused on our practical experience in gas tank failure cases: 
retention of experts and preparation of direct testimony of liability experts for preliminary motions and 
trial focusing on defects in the saddlebag tank, proposed alternative placement and designs which 
would maintain fuel system integrity. <em>In re: General Motors Corporation Pickup Truck Fuel Tank 
Products Liability Litigation,</em> U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, MDL No. 961, 
Master File No. 92-6450. San Jose Mercury News, August 27, 1993; Wall Street Journal, 
December 17, 1993. The federal court plaintiffs by agreement with attorneys in state cases filed 
across the South joined all cases for settlement purposes in the Louisiana state court where preliminary 
approval of a new settlement was given on July 3,1996. A final approval hearing will take place on 
November 6, 1996 and approval is expected. In the absence of an appeal the settlement will become 
effective in early January 1997. New York Times, July 4, 1996, San Jose Mercury New July 4, 
1996, San Francisco Chronicle July 4, 1996, Wall Street Journal July 5, 1996, Associated Press 
Wire Services July 3, 1996.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Computer Dealers</strong>. In 1991 Apple Computer discharged 400 of its 800 dealers who sold 
Apple products exclusively to school districts and in 1993 fired 381 of its remaining dealers, leaving 
19 sellers in the K-12 market. In this national class action, it is claimed that at the time Apple entered 
into the 1991 dealer contracts it acted in bad faith and intended from the outset to glean proprietary 
sales data from its &quot;partners&quot; in the education market. </p>
<p><strong>Arsenic</strong>. Sutter Creek, California, population 2,000, is the location of the Central Eureka Mine, a 
closed gold mine site and an 11 acre pile of mine tailings containing arsenic upon which a new 
subdivision was built. We rerpesent 143 adults and children who live in the Mesa del Oro 
neighborhood of Sutter Creek in an action against the owner of the mine, Allied Signal. The lawsuit, 
filed in April, 1995 in Amador County Superior Court, seeks compensation for property damage, 
nuisance and fear of cancer. Arsenic is a known carcinogen and is strongly associated with an 
increased risk of skin cancer and cancers of the lung, liver, bladder, kidney and colon; chronic 
inhalation of arenicals has been closely linked with lung cancer. The latency period for skin cancer 
associated with ingestion of arsenic may be 30 to 40 years. For details on the Mesa del Oro, see Time 
Magazine, September 25, 1995, Arensic and Old Mines, page 36.</p>
<p><strong>Breast Implants</strong>. We represent 250 women with implants in conjunction with this national class 
action in Birmingham, Alabama. </p>
<p><strong>Honda Dealers</strong>. In May, 1994 we filed a national class action for 1,250 Honda and Acura dealers 
who refused to pay bribes or kickbacks to Honda sales executives. Twenty-three former senior 
Honda sales executives have been indicted and twenty-one have pled guilty. Two were found guilty at 
trial. We are seeking to hold the company responsible for treble damages under the federal RICO 
racketeering laws on behalf of dealers who did not participate in Honda's program of allowing its sales 
staff to allocate vehicles to dealers based on bribes, kickbacks and under the table payments. Cases 
filed across the U.S. are now coordinated for pretrial discovey in the U.S. District Court for Maryland 
in Baltimore and we served as one of two class action firms on the Plaintiffs Executive Committee. </p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Druggists</strong>. The major drug companies have been trying to put the unaffiliated, 
independent pharmacist out of business with a pricing system that in many cases requires sales at 
prices that are below cost. This class action on behalf of neighborhood pharmacists is pending in San 
Francisco. </p>
<p><strong>Radiation Experiment Victims</strong>. We are one of four firms in pending class actions in Cincinnati, 
Ohio against General Hospital for experimenting with radiation on terminal cancer patients. We 
represent the only living survivor of the program. </p>
<p><strong>Radioactive Gravel</strong>. In federal court in Columbus, Ohio we are suing a nuclear waste facility for 
selling gravel and fill dirt that has a level of radioactivity that is five times greater than allowed by the 
Nuclear Regulatory Agency. This class action seeks clean-up and medical monitoring for all people 
living within 20 miles of the waste facility who have been exposed. </p>

<p>While it is often said that the &quot;past is prologue,&quot; a testimonial, endorsement or result in a particular case does not constitute a promise, prediction or guarantee 
regarding the outcome of any other case. For those whom we represent The Alexander Law Firm commits its best efforts. Those efforts over the years are reported 
here. Each case was dependent on a multiplicity of factors and unique facts. Because of many different factors, results always will differ from case to case. For that 
reason the results that we obtained in these cases are no guarantee that we can again achieve the same results in any future case. In fact to understand what we 
achieved in these cases we have provided a substantial amount of information, including references to news articles and court files, so anyone can evaluate and 
make their own determination of the result and our record. There is only common factor in all the cases reported here: the plaintiff was represented by Richard 
Alexander or The Alexander Law Firm.</p>

<p>$8,132,000 jury verdict for plaintiffs in <i>Byer v. Market Transport</i> after an eight-day trial, tried by Richard Alexander <i>after rejecting a settlement offer of $4.5 
million</i>. Byer, age 15, suffered irreversible brain damage when the Byer family car was sideswiped by a tractor and trailer. The jury deliberated one day before 
delivering its unanimous verdict. Reported: California Jury Verdict Reporter, February 7, 1986; The Recorder, January 7, 1986, page one; San Francisco 
Examiner, December 21, 1985; San Jose Mercury News, December 21, 1985, B-1; Times Tribune, December 22, 1985, A-1. </p>
<p>Lead attorney in <i>Nevarez v. Foremost Dairies</i>, a multi-vehicle auto-truck collision that resulted in identical C- 5/C-6 quadriplegic injuries to a father and daughter, 
when their car was rear-ended on smoke-covered I-5 by the defendant's tractor and trailer. More than 25 depositions and motions were required to bring the case 
to trial in San Francisco. Following a five-day settlement conference, the defendant's insurance carriers offered $10,000,000 in settlement or promised they would 
try the case in response to my demand of $13,500,000. While trailing for a trial department in San Francisco, an additional $1,000,000. was forthcoming and the 
plaintiffs accepted a total settlement of $11,000,000. Reported in the California Jury Verdict Reporter, February 7, 1986. </p>
<p>Trial attorney for the plaintiff in <i>Aceves v. Regal Pale</i> <i>Brewing</i>, 24 C.3d 502, in which the California Supreme Court unanimously recognized the special risks

<p>Trial attorney for an employee of a roofing contractor in <i>Perry v. Western Refrigerating and Cold Storage</i>, a suit for injuries caused by a fall of 25 feet from a 
domed warehouse roof. Western Refrigerating, the building's owner, offered $16,000 in settlement before trial. Because of a $16,000 worker's compensation 
insurance lien, the offer would have resulted in no recovery for the plaintiff. The jury agreed with the plaintiff that the contemplated work by the contractor required 
the taking of special precautions by the owner to prevent falls. After an eight-day trial the jury awarded the plaintiff $285,000, less twenty-five percent for the 
plaintiff's comparative fault. </p>

Superior Court, a total settlement of $420,000 was paid by a child molester's homeowners insurance company for psychological injuries suffered by a minor. 
Although the insurance company originally denied coverage for the homeowner's criminal act, the settlement was obtained by proving the molester was &quot;negligent by 
reason of mental incapacity&quot;, an act covered by homeowner's insurance coverage. These unique cases were the subject of a front-page article in the San Jose News 
on June 23, 1983, and a feature article in the San Jose Mercury News on June 24, 1983. See also feature article, San Francisco Examiner, page 1, August 5,

<p>Trial attorney for a 27-year-old construction laborer employed by Pestana Construction Company who was injured by a backhoe during the installation of a sewer 
line for the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency. The total award for Robert Dante was $325,000, plus waiver of the worker's compensation lien. 
The lien was waived because of Pestana's negligence in ordering the plaintiff into a trench when heavy equipment was operating nearby. Morrison-Knudsen and 
MRWPCA both held liable under Restatement 416 requirements of <i>Aceves v. Regal Pale</i>. Salinas Californian, January 26, 1984. </p>

<p>Trial attorney in <i>McGreevy v. Abbott</i>, first civil child molestation case tried in Santa Clara County. The child molester claimed he accidentally brushed this 
six-year-old plaintiff's cheek and pled no contest in his criminal prosecution to save his family further embarrassment. The victim's therapist reported the child had 
substantially recovered during one year of therapy but may require further counselling during adolescence and adulthood. Rejecting a good faith settlement offer of 
$100,000, Farmers Insurance Company offered $40,000. Five-day trial resulted in a $175,000 verdict for the child and her mother. San Jose Mercury News, B-1, 
December 1984. </p>
<p>Obtained $750,000 recovery for burn injuries caused by a defectively designed electrical switch for PG&amp;E lineman who admitted causing his own injury. 
<i>Smethurst v. G&amp;W Specialty Company</i> settled the morning of trial after extensive pre- trial discovery against manufacturers of a 12,000 volt oil-filled switch 
which exploded when Smethurst turned the switch to the wrong position and, contrary to good practice, attempted to return the switch to its original position. 
Similar switches caused 10 deaths and 21 serious injuries over a 25-year period, but no warnings were ever distributed to users. Smethurst suffered burns over 
60% of his body and was disabled for 14 months before returning to work as a PG&amp;E lineman. San Francisco Chronicle, January 31, 1985; Times Tribune, A-1,

<p>Chief counsel for plaintiffs in <i>Furchtenicht v. Peabody</i> <i>Barnes and General Electric</i>, a product liability case for wrongful death settled for $750,000. Plaintiffs' 
decedent, father of three, electrocuted himself when he clipped the grounding plug from an extension cord that was attached to a three-prong submersible sump 
pump. During a heavy downpour, Mr. Furchtenicht attempted to drain his swimming pool of ground water by using the submersible sump pump with the modified 
extension cord. The sump pump shorted as he stood next to it and he suffered cardiac arrest. Subsequent investigation showed the pump wiring had shorted due to 
defective insulation and the manufacturer's assembly protocols were designed to pass defective pumps, which all helped overcome the decedent's high level of 
contributory negligence (as an engineering student in college he had taken three courses in electricity). Unreported settlement paid by Gibraltar Casualty Company 
of Newark, New Jersey, Check 6562 of October 11, 1985, in the sum of $750,000. </p>
<p>Chief counsel for the victims of child molestation in <i>California Casualty v. Weber</i>, a case of first impression in Santa Clara County. Weber, a convicted pedophile, 
had molested two young girls, ages 8 and 9. After suit was filed he was advised to tender his defense to his homeowner's insurance company, which brought the 
instant action seeking to avoid defending Weber and not satisfying the children's claims. The court held that Weber suffered from a mental disease, could not control 
his conduct in accordance with reason and the insurance carrier, under these limited circumstances, was obligated to satisfy the victims' claims for damages, even 
though a result of criminal conduct. Decision rendered February 26, 1986, by Hon. Read Ambler. </p>
<p><i>Bucol v. City of Oakland</i> arose from the shooting death of an 18-year-old in the Oakland Auditorium at a Kool and The Gang Concert, by unknown assailants. 
Thorough investigation and discovery showed that the City and rock promoter failed to establish reasonable security precautions, despite knowing the reputation of 
the character of the crowd usually attracted by this type of concert and not stopping the concert when multiple fights and thefts were reported. Despite intervening 
criminal conduct, the rock promoter agreed to settle this tragic death for the sum of $250,000. </p>
<p>Chief trial counsel in the first jury trial in the United States contesting the power of cities to grant an exclusive monopoly to a cable television firm, <i>Pacific West 
Cable</i> <i>Company v. City of Sacramento</i>, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. Called into case one month before trial. In four weeks, six feet 
of pleadings, 4,000 pages of deposition testimony, and more than 1,000 documents were digested and analyzed. Trial began March 23, 1987, and after thirteen 
weeks, the jury found that cable television was not a natural monopoly, that the construction of a cable television system did not cause significant disruption, noise, 
environmental or safety hazards, that the franchising process did not result in a better cable television system, that the franchising process was adopted to enhance 
the contributions and political power of local politicians, and that the granting of monopoly to disseminate news, information and entertainment was a violation of the 
constitutional right of free speech. Co-counsel Harold Farrow, Oakland. Reported, The Sacramento Bee, June 6, 1987, A-34. See also &quot;City Ends Cable TV

<p>$1,750,000 recovery in <i>Whiteley and Cox v. The State of California, </i>a personal injury action against the California Highway Patrol arising from a late night 
pursuit of an escapee from the California Youth Authority who was driving a stolen vehicle. Depositions of 21 experts were taken in this case. The central liability 
issue, which was strongly disputed, was whether the CHP had activated its siren to warn the general public that it was an emergency vehicle. The fleeing escapee 
violated a red light and collided with plaintiffs causing multiple fractures and head injuries. At the time of the settlement, two years post- injury, both plaintiffs were 
preparing to return to work. Settled June 19, 1989, Fresno County Superior Court, Action No. 376393-5. </p>
<p>In <i>Repetto v. Weyerhauser</i>, a vehicle was driven under a trailer parked across a commercial street in San Jose at night. The owner, Mr. Repetto, had a blood 
alcohol level of .18 and had a suspended license at the time of the collision. Discovery revealed several alternative places for parking trailers for unloading and the 
failure of Weyerhauser to maintain reflectors on the side of the trailer, which resulted in a settlement of $120,000 in an otherwise impossible case. <i>Repetto v. 
Weyerhauser</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court Action No. 604529. </p>
<p><i>Collins v. Van Waters &amp; Rogers, </i>a products liability action, involved the first medically reported case of lip cancer secondary to repeated exposure to liquid 
chromate solvents used as cleaning agents in the manufacture of electronic components. Exposure occurred between 1979 and 1984. During this time the product 
carried warnings that it was hazardous and could cause death. While there had been no known cases of cancer caused by these compounds, a $250,000 recovery 
was obtained for the failure to warn of the cancer causing potential of these products. Settlement involved waiver of a $57,000 worker's compensation lien for 
previous benefits and an additional cash payment of $60,000 from the worker's compensation carrier. Total recovery $367,000 for a case of first impression. Santa 
Clara County Superior Court, 516914. </p>

child, 17 year old daughter Jennifer, a high school senior, who lived with her mother following her parents divorce in 1985. Swanson, a former refining engineer, 
was Chevron's manager of public relations in Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, earning $72,000 per year. Each surviving child received 
$800,000, plus worker's compensation death benefits of $70,000, less $7,500 in repayment of worker's compensation liens. Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Action No. C671784. </p>

Trucking</i>, San Joaquin County Superior Court Action No. 186124. </p>
<p>In <i>Barger v. Morrison Homes</i>, plaintiff, an employee of a framing contractor suffered a head injury when he fell from a second story of a single family home after 
the frame structure was struck by his employer's fork lift. In another Restatement 416 peculiar risk of harm case, the general contractor was sued for failing to take 
special precautions to prevent such an injury from occurring and settled prior to trial for $300,000 in cash, waiver of the worker's lien of $158,877.53 and a lifetime 
payment of $1,500 per month, which will pay plaintiff $1,953,731 over his lifetime. Contra Costa County Superior Court, 1987. </p>

in proving medical care by Chinese physicians, with hospitalization and surgery in Taiwan. </p>
<p>In <i>Meyer v. Skillicorn</i> cattle escaped from a pasture and wandered onto Route 1 in Monterey County, near the Presidio. Meyer, a twenty year old from Missouri 
stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, was killed when his motorcycle collided with a cow. Settlement of $175,000 for both parents after setting aside a pre-case

<p>$400,000 wrongful death recovery for two sons who lost their 62 year old father and a son and daughter who lost their 64 year old mother, both residents of Texas 
vacationing in California when they were victims of a head-on collision. <i>Wigley v. Tru-Products,</i> Los Angeles County Superior Court Action No. NVC 5723. </p>
<p>$140,000 recovery for a mountain climber against the Sierra Club in <i>Shaoul v. Sierra Club</i>. Brought to the eve of trial fifteen months after the fall, the key issues in 
this case involved proving the plaintiff did not accept the risk of falling during a practice rock climbing session at Handley Rock, was not at fault in failing to check 
rigging used by others before him, and was not an uninvited recreational user for whom the Sierra Club was immune from suit. Because this was a case of 
extraordinarily difficult liability, this settlement represents an excellent recovery in what was clearly a defensible case. San Francisco Superior Court, No. 896640. 
September, 1989. </p>
<p>$178,500 recovery in Natchitoches Parish (Shreveport) Louisiana for a fractured humerus and closed head injury suffered by a University of California student

<p>In <i>Tonne v. Statewide Foreclosures</i>, three teenagers lost their mother when the Cessna 182 in which she was a passenger crashed into the ocean after departing 
Oceano County Airport. The aircraft was never recovered after the crash and the FAA reported the crash due to unknown reasons. In extensive recovery it was 
established that the pilot planned to make a left turn upon take-off and conduct a low level flight over friends vacationing on the beach. Plaintiffs contended the pilot 
had insufficient night flying experience to make an instrument turn on a dark moonless night that did not provide him with external visual references and that the pilot 
in flying his intended and announced route had flown the Cessna into the ocean. Witnesses on the ground claimed the aircraft caught on fire after they heard a loud 
bang and defendants claimed the crash, therefore was not due to pilot error. Settled at the beginning of trial for $600,000 on July 17, 1989. Santa Clara County 
No. 640888. Jury Verdict Reporter, volume 33, page 11, December 29, 1989.</p>
<p>In <i>Pedroza v. Westinghouse</i> an employee of Ray Wilson Construction Company fell 63 feet to his death from the top of a warehouse platform crane. Prior to his 
death Steven Pedroza, age 20, had climbed to the warehouse ceiling to plan for repairs to the roof and onto the horizontal beam of the crane which spanned the 
width of the building. Leaving the safety of the catwalk, he walked on the greased trolley track and fell. Despite overwhelming comparative negligence, a settlement 
of $435,000 was obtained for his family after investigation and discovery showed that Westinghouse security employees had provided his access to the crane 
building without providing an escort as required by Westinghouse company rules. In the absence of an escort, Pedroza did not comply with Westinghouse 
regulations which forbid anyone from climbing on a crane and which require all crane inspections to be conducted from safety scaffolds. Santa Clara County 
Superior Court No. 542030. </p>
<p>$87,500 recovery in <i>Byrnes v. Palo Alto Square, </i>Santa Clara County 597610. A 24 year-old computer systems programmer was injured when an elevator 
abruptly stopped between the fifth and sixth floors. Maintenance workers had left a ceiling hatch cover open on top of the elevator which collided with the elevator's 
counter-weights causing an emergency stop jarring plaintiff's back. Plaintiff suffered a herniated disc at L4-5, had previously had surgery at L4-5, and had a long 
history of low back pathology. Settled this difficult of medical causation against the building owners for new money and independent of the worker's compensation 
lien of $30,338. The worker's compensation carrier proceeded to trial and recovered nothing. The jury found Palo Alto Square was negligent BUT by a vote of 
12-0 held that its negligence was not a cause of plaintiff's injury. All of plaintiff's medical expenses of $21,281 were paid by the worker's compensation carrier and 
plaintiff was not required to repay $9,000 in temporary disability benefits previously received. Reported in California Jury Verdicts Weekly, September 1, 1989. </p>

90 miles per hour. The BMW exploded into a fireball and caused third degree burns to 65% of Dr. 
Chin's body. Following the collision, the BMW wreckage mysteriously disappeared near the time 
BMW's investigators photographed the scene and the bullet vehicle. An identical vehicle was lost in a 
nearly identical case arising in New York which was defensed by BMW in 1982. Crash testing of two 
full size BMW's proved the fuel system failed at low speeds in rear end collisions. This settlement was 
the first known occasion of a settlement by BMW in a case alleging a design defect. BMW models 
involved in this design include the 1600 and 2002 for 1966-73. Specially presented to the California

Mills was employed by California Commerce Bank when her heel pierced the carpeting and lodged in an uncovered hole in the concrete slab. During the six day 
trial plaintiff contended the carpeting company negligently inspected the premises and failed to permanently attach metal plates over holes with bolts or screws. 
Medical expenses $13,818, wage loss of $18,733, and future surgery costs of $15,000, plus six months loss of work to recuperate. Jury out four hours. $210,516

<p>In <i>Singh v. National Real Estate</i>, two year old Ciera Singh suffered brain damage when she and her father crossed a dark street and were stuck by an oncoming 
vehicle operated by a real estate salesman who was showing property to prospective customers on behalf of a local realty firm. Re-creation of the collision 
sequence with night photography and the testimony of accident reconstruction, bio-mechanical and human factors experts combined to show that the salesman's 
explanation of his speed and the collision sequence was unprovable. The broker was an independently owned and operated franchisee of a national real estate firm. 
The franchisor routinely avoided liability in similar cases throughout the United States, claiming that it was not responsible for its franchisee's torts, that it had no 
control over day-to-day operations and merely provided a trademark, logo, and national advertising program. By undertaking in-depth research of economic 
literature, retaining economists who have studied franchising, conducting a detailed investigation of operating policies, it was apparent that the creation of a national 
real estate network amounted to a joint venture. The confidential recovery was structured to provide a monthly stipend, increasing annually, to provide 
round-the-clock care for Ciera for the balance of her life. All funds are now administered through a bank's trust department, serving under court supervision. 
Because Ciera's care required prompt funding, this September 27, 1989 injury was brought to trial on July 30, 1990 and settled on July 31, 1990. In the interim, 
plaintiff's counsel offered 14 expert witnesses and completed discovery of an additional 29 parties, witnesses and defense experts, for a total of 43 pre-trial 
depositions. Santa Clara County Superior Court No. 693716. For legal analysis, see <i>Proving a National Real Estate Franchisor's Joint Venture Tort Liability</i>,

<p>$100,000, policy limits, recovery in <i>Tejnil v. Yem</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court No. 687474 arising from an automobile collision in which the injured-owner 
suffered a head injury and as a result did not recall any of the events involving, or preceding, the collision. The defendant driver, a high school classmate of the 
plaintiff, reported to police that he recalled driving his friend's sports car. Defendant located a witness who reported seeing the car speed pass him and<i> seeing the 
defendant in the passenger's seat.</i> At the crash site he again identified the plaintiff behind the wheel and the defendant in the passenger's seat, both unconscious. 
Defendant insurance carrier, facing an exposure well above its coverage, offered its $100,000 coverage the morning of trial. </p>
<p>Scott Cunningham, an aspiring pre-med student, suffered a traumatic hearing loss when a automobile battery exploded while he was &quot;jump&quot; starting a co-worker's 
car. The exploded battery was discarded the day of the explosion and in a short time the car was sold. After locating the car in Nevada, an inspection of the engine 
compartment confirmed the explosion path and a pattern of debris commonly left by an explosion of a defective battery. Repair records of the original owner 
revealed the manufacturer of the battery. The battery had been designed with two &quot;gang&quot; caps on the top of the battery that were each intended to plug three 
separate battery cells and to be held in place by compression. Accordingly any unit difference would result in leakage of hydrogen gas, which is acutely present in 
batteries that have been run down and in need of charging. Leaking hydrogen gas from automobile batteries readily explodes when ignited by a spark from jumper 
cables and for that reason the absence of individually screwed caps and warning labels was mandated. After an eight day jury trial in Santa Clara County Superior 
Court, the jury found for the defense and later explained that the absence of the actual defective battery was fatal to the plaintiff's case of design and product defect.

<p>$274,867 verdict, after rejecting a $20,000 settlement offer, by a 12-0 vote in <i>Adisa v. Yellow Cab</i>, San Francisco Superior Court No. 888921. Yellow Cab 
claimed that its driver had not &quot;blown&quot; a stop sign and that plaintiff had caused his own injuries as a result of speeding at 35-40 mph in a 25 mph residential area, 
was a convicted felon, and had received medical care for previous injuries to his neck. Defendants claimed at trial that plaintiff had suffered a neck strain which 
should have resolved in 6 to 8 weeks and that he could work as an operating engineer. Because of the lack of proof that plaintiff's bulging discs were in fact caused 
by this collision, the settlement demand was $300,000. Defendant offered $20,000 in settlement; the settlement conference judge valued the case at $125,000 to 
$150,000. Medical damages were $16,876. Following argument when defense counsel boasted that he expected a defense verdict, he was told the verdict would 
be $275,000. After a five day trial before Judge Pro Tem Craig Needham the jury deliberated for a day before rendering its verdict for $274,867, which was the 
largest single loss suffered by Yellow Cab in San Francisco in the previous ten years according to defense counsel. The verdict was 12-0 as to negligence, 
causation, and damages. Judgment entered March 11, 1991; paid March 13, 1991. Reported in California Jury Verdicts Weekly, August 16, 1991. </p>
<p>In February, 1991, an extremely broad gag order in <i>Vagshenian v. Palo Alto Unified School District,</i> Santa Clara County Action No. 687672, was imposed by 
the Court after jury selection, opening statements, and the testimony of Dr. Gregory Vagshenian. The San Jose Mercury News, July 29, 1989, reported that a nine 
year old boy was burned by a model rocket engine that shot up his sleeve. At the time the youngster, a third grader at Ohlone School, was attending a science fair 
at school and was observing a demonstration set up by Roland Horne, a Stanford professor. The experiment was intended to demonstrate how a rocket would 
burn in the absence of oxygen. According to one witness, the rocket was tied to one end of a pole with the other end of the pole placed in a bucket of water. When 
the rocket was ignited it flew off the pole and lodged itself near Erik's right armpit. Suit was filed against the Palo Alto Unified School District, the boy's teacher and 
the Stanford University engineering professor who set off the rocket, according to the Mercury. Under the gag order the victim and attorneys are only allowed to 
say: &quot;The matter is concluded.&quot; Sealed by Order May 2, 1991. </p>
<p><i>DeBruin v. Beach</i> arose from an assault by Dr. Christopher Beach, a chiropractor, upon Dr. Michael DeBruin, a chiropractor, who was dating Beach's estranged 
wife Dr. Cindy Gambelli, also a chiropractor. Beach's carriers denied coverage, but contributed a total of $50,000 towards a stipulated judgment of $150,000. 
Beach claimed that he was temporarily insane when he found Dr. DeBruin visiting his estranged wife; Dr. Beach was engaged during the pendency of his divorce, 
the divorce became final one month after the assault, and Beach knew that Dr. DeBruin and Dr. Gambelli had spent their summer vacation traveling together in 
Europe. During the pendency of this case the California Supreme Court decided J.C. Penny Casualty Insurance Co. v. M.K. in favor of the insurance industry 
holding that criminal conduct that on its face is harmful is precluded from coverage, even when there is underlying psychopathology that is severe. Santa Clara 
County Superior Court No. 689762. Judgment entered March, 1991. </p>
<p>$100,000 recovery for a backhoe operator who failed to wear eye protection and lost an eye while replacing a steel bucket tooth with a steel hammer, in violation 
of the manufacturer's safety warnings and written warnings on the hammer. Original attorney consulted by plaintiff declined to take the case because of the victim's 
fault in causing his own injury. Investigation showed that the original H &amp; L fabricated digging tooth had been designed to be attached to a steel shank by the use of 
a ball peen hammer. Hensley USA, a casting foundry, produced the tooth as a casting of extreme hardness, knowing that the primary mode of attachment in the 
field was by hammering. Judicial arbitration resulted in an award for the defendants, confirming the difficult liability presented in this case. Settled April, 1991.

<p><i>Ingvardsen</i> v.<i> Lucky Stores</i>, Santa Clara County No. 705350, because of aggressive representation, was one of the first defective product L-tryptophan 
poisoning cases to be set for trial [October 28, 1991] in California. June Ingvardsen, a 56 year old, Los Altos mother of three boys and paralegal assistant of 18 
years, consumed one bottle of the contaminated L-tryptophan, an essential amino acid and food supplement, in September, 1989. She began experiencing 
symptoms and was diagnosed with EMS in November, 1989. EMS is a painful and progressive, multi-system disease which causes permanent scarring and fibrosis 
to nerve and muscle tissues, continuing inflammation, and provokes a permanent change in the body's immune system. In October, 1990, a complaint was filed 
against Lucky Stores, Inc.; Showa Denko was sued by Lucky Stores and joined as a cross-defendant. Showa Denko's plan to delay Ms. Ingvardsen's case by 
consolidating all California L- tryptophan cases in Los Angeles was successfully opposed and discovery was actively pursued to bring the case to trial. The case 
settled immediately prior to trial in a day long settlement conference before the Hon. David Leahy. Pursuant to the demand of Lucky Stores and Showa Denko 
K.K. the settlement sum is confidential and neither counsel or plaintiffs are allowed to comment on the adequacy of the recovery. </p>
<p>Another confidential recovery in <i>Wyatt </i>v. <i>Longs Drugs</i> for EMS injuries caused by L-tryptophan. Settled prior to March, 1992 trial. </p>
<p>Confidential recovery against Showa Denko for contaminated L-tryptophan in <i>Selbach v. Stanford University Hospital</i>, Santa Clara County Action No. 704321. 
Settled May, 1992 prior to June 15, 1992 trial date. </p>
<p>Additional confidential recoveries against Showa Denko for contaminated L-tryptophan in <i>Aguiar v. Showa Denko</i>, <i>Bransford v. Showa Denko</i> and <i>Zigalo v. 
Showa Denko, </i>San Francisco Superior Court. </p>
<p>Served as a consultant to San Francisco attorney and assisted in a confidential recovery in <i>Bailey v. Showa Denko</i>, case in which the victim suffered eosinophilia 
leukemia. The Mayo Clinic EMS team of physicians had concluded that Mr. Bailey's leukemia was unrelated to the L-tryptophan he had taken. Immediately prior 
to the final day for disclosure of expert witnesses, The Alexander Law Firm was consulted and arranged for experienced physicians to evaluate the plaintiff's claims. 
Settled upon being called to trial for a sum thirteen times greater than plaintiff's counsel was willing to accept prior to contacting us. Verification available from Bruce 
Krell, Esq. 415-861-4414. </p>
<p>$210,000 recovery for a head injury in <i>Fierro v. Firestone</i>, in which a 16 inch tire was installed on a 16.5 inch wheel and exploded due to a defect in the bead 
splice. The defendant claimed the tire had been abused in the course of being installed and that plaintiff's drinking of six beers was a major contributing factor. 
Normally in this type of explosion both the tire manufacturer and the wheel manufacturer [there are only two in the United States, Budd and Kelsey-Hayes] are 
joined as defendants. Unfortunately prior counsel never named the wheel manufacturer, although he had represented the client for three years. Upon entry we 
attempted to serve the wheel manufacturer as a fictitious defendant and were denied the right to join Kelsey-Hayes, which we appealed and lost. Fortunately the 
expert hired by previous counsel was forced to retire due to health and age, which allowed us to retain a formidable expert for trial. With alcohol and misuse 
defenses, this case under the best of circumstances would be difficult to win, but with an empty chair defense due to the absence of Kelsey-Hayes any settlement 
was considered a victory. Fresno County Superior Court 379634-9. For a detailed explanation of tire explosions see Product Liability: Preventing Deaths From 
Tire Explosions Caused By Known Design Defects, 22 CTLA Forum 17, Sept. 1992. </p>
<p>Forty year old Santa Clara Traffic Officer suffered a fractured elbow and wrist, with permanent nerve damages resulting in forced retirement, when his motorcycle 
was struck by a vehicle making a u-turn. Retained June, 1991 and obtained a recovery of $925,000 on April 28, 1992. Worker's compensation lien of $133,000 
was compromised for $100,000, despite no employer's negligence, in exchange for a compromise and release of the workers' compensation claim. Medical 
specials of $33,000 and projected partial wage loss of $350,000 argued despite the fact that the plaintiff had found full-time employment as an investigator in the 
electronics industry. <i>Robert Dorsey v. Oregon Plan</i>, Santa Clara County Action No. 712292. </p>

<p>Largest known recovery in the United States - $1,450,000 - in an adoption fraud case on behalf of a 16 year old and his parents. The boy had been the victim of 
years of abuse as an infant when he was placed for adoption at age four. The adopting parents were told there had been one instance of abuse, but the actual extent 
of the abuse and the youngster's complete psychiatric history were concealed from both the adopting parents and the child's pediatrician. Years later, a severe 
personality disorder erupted which required hospitalization from age 13 to 17. Referred by a family attorney who had the case pending for three years with no 
progress, trial preparation began in mid-1991. After securing psychiatric, social work, economic, and life placement expert testimony, completing 20 depositions, 
and defeating multiple motions to dismiss, the case was called for trial on July 6 and settled on July 7, 1992. Extremely difficult legal liability presented because 
under California law the county was immune from liability for negligent misrepresentation and could only be held liable for willful acts for which the insurance carriers 
would not be responsible. In addition, under Prop 51, the Anti-Deep Pocket Law, the county was not responsible for the harm caused by the minor's family prior to 
the adoption and a jury could have found his natural parents and relatives substantially at fault for his current psychiatric condition. County had also raised a statute 
of limitations defense that the adopting parents were on notice of the child's severe problems within one year of the adoption and clearly within three years after he 
was adopted. <i>Forter v. County of San Mateo</i>, Action No. 332087. San Jose Mercury News, July 8, 1992, B-1; July 9, 1992, B-1, July 12, A-1. Peninsula

<p>Confidential recovery for the death of a 16 year old who lost his life in a rollover of a CJ-7 Jeep in <i>Mock v. Chrysler Corporation</i>, Fresno County Superior Court 
Action Number 442560-9. One of three sons, Aaron Mock, was driving on a two lane, paved farm road with a keg of beer enroute to a high school party. He 
executed a right turn at a higher than safe speed, drifted into the oncoming lane, and in attempting to maneuver the Jeep back to the right side of the roadway, lost 
control. Jeep's classic instability, due to a narrow wheel base, short overall length, and high center of gravity, resulted in the rollover. The seat belted passenger 
suffered minor injuries. Aaron Mock was thrown from his seat and crushed by the rollbar. In addition to the seat belt defense, father's previous separate counsel's 
pursuit of a claim against Fresno County for a dangerous condition of a public roadway provided Chrysler with Prop 51 defense that the roadway was a major 
contributing cause of the death. The roadway was not a cause of this rollover. <i>Settled July 1992 on a confidential basis at the demand of Chrysler and agreed 
to by surviving parents. </i></p>
<p>$950,000 recovery in <i>Takeuchi </i>and <i>Kamiya</i> v. <i>Keegan</i>, Monterey County Superior Court Number 92486, arising from a head-on collision on August 4, 1991 on 
Route 156 near U.S. 101. Mari Kamiya, a 28 year old Japanese development engineer with IBM Japan in Tokyo was visiting the Bay Area and sharing a Sunday 
excursion with Dr. Tatsu Takeuchi, a family friend research physicist with the Stanford Linear Accelerator when the collision occurred. Ms. Kamiya, a passenger, 
incurred $87,000 in medical expenses immediately following the crash for severe fractures to her right clavicle, left ulna [forearm] and a fracture of L-1 with 
Harrington instrumentation and fusion of T-10 through L-2 lumbar vertebrae. With these extensive injuries the defense pressed a seat belt defense which was 
disproved by our expert accident reconstruction and testimony of a biomechanical engineer which established that in high speed collisions substantial injuries are 
often suffered even with seat belts in place. Total recovery for Ms. Kamiya was $900,000. She is expected to enjoy a full recovery. Dr. Takeuchi suffered a 
penetrating wound to the knee and has fully recovered. His medical bills totaled $8,500 and he approved a recovery of $50,000. Trial date of September 21, 
1992. Case settled on September 11, 1992 at the second extended settlement conference. Aggressive preparation and a prompt referral by original attorney on 
August 14, 1991 resulted in this early and very good result. </p>
<p>$1,350,000 recovery in a defective product case where a model airplane caused a leg fracture. Plaintiff, a 48 year old United Airlines pilot, on October 15, 1989 
was struck by a high speed model airplane being clocked for speed at a sanctioned competition of the Academy of Model Aeronautics at Whittier Narrows. The 
crash of the model airplane and the injuries to plaintiff were caused by faulty construction, faulty pre-flight inspection, and the failure to conduct such races in 
protected fenced arenas. In addition, the standard AMA pre-flight pull test is believed to have caused the failure of fuselage bolts which caused the plane to fly out 
of control at a speed of 184 m.p.h. Because he was a co-participant in the racing competition and had started the doomed aircraft, the Academy claimed the 
plaintiff assumed the risk of this injury, although this was the first known case of such an injury occurring. Assumption of risk is a complete defense in recreational 
activities under recent decisions of California courts. Because of a non-union of the tibia and fibula, eleven medical procedures were required at a cost of $220,000. 
Fortunately plaintiff returned to return to work as a pilot. <i>Armstead</i> v. <i>Academy of Model Aeronautics</i>, Alameda County Superior Court No. H-150430-1 settled 
before Hon. Daniel Weinstein, retired judge of the Superior Court, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, on September 8, 1992. </p>
<p>The evidence was in the victim s body in the case of a $550,000 recovery for the family of Tim Skaggs who died of leukemia in 1991 at age 40, having been 
exposed to Woodlife during the years 1971-72 while employed by Simpson Lumber Company in Arcata, California. In an investigation of three other leukemias at 
the Simpson mill by the State Department of Health, Simpson concealed from officials that for years it had used wood preservatives with pentachlorophenol. The 
state concluded this cancer cluster arose from unknown causes. The Alexander Law Firm undertook an extraordinarily detailed investigation which began with an 
indepth analysis of pentachlorophenol and other lawsuits in the United States. See <i>A Developing Toxic Tort: Lumber Mills, Log Cabins, Leukemia, 
Lymphomas and Soft Tissue Sarcomas - The Case Against Pentachlorophenol</i>, 21 CTLA Forum 195 (1991). Following numerous interviews of mill workers, 
many of whom had no recollection of Tim s part-time work on the paint line where Woodlife was applied twenty years ago, the paint line operator confirmed that 
Woodlife had been used in painting machines, but he had no recollection of Tim working there. Although Simpson s mill records no longer existed, its purchasing 
agent confirmed it had purchased Woodlife by the barrel from Champion International. Champion s sales manager of twenty years ago was located and he testified 
Woodlife was sold to the Arcata plant for use on the paint line. To prove Tim s exposure, a fat sample was taken from his abdomen and analyzed for dioxins and 
furans suspected to have contaminated Woodlife. After an extensive search, a twenty year old bucket of pentachlorophenol was located and tested, revealing an 
80% correlation between the pattern of dioxins found in Tim s fat and those found in the sample product. Settled April 29, 1993 before Judge Michael Brown, 
following the denial of Champion s motion for summary judgment and after the completion of expert depositions before the May 17th scheduled trial. <i>Skaggs v. 
Champion International</i>, Humboldt County Superior Court No. DR 85488. See also The Times Standard, May 6, 1993, page one. Served as lead counsel in

<p><em>GM Pickup Gas Tank.</em> On July 3, 1996 a $5 billion dollar settlement of this national class action was announced. The <a href="http://www.seamless.com/alexanderlaw/txt/reserved.html">complete details</a> of the settlement can be 
found on this web site. The new settlement meets all the objections raised to a previous class action settlement for GM truck owners which was reversed by the 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals and by the Texas Court of Appeals. All lawsuits against GM filed in federal courts across the United States were transferred to the 
U. S. District Court in Philadelphia under federal Multi-District Litigation rules. The Alexander Law Firm represents 278 of 283 
plaintiffs before the Honorable William H. Yohn, Jr. Our case was the only one entitled to be heard under federal court jurisdiction rules because it is based on the 
U. S. Magnusson-Moss Act for breach of warranty, which requires 100 plaintiffs to prosecute a class action. Our contribution to the legal team focused on our 
practical experience in gas tank failure cases: retention of experts and preparation of direct testimony of liability experts for preliminary motions and trial focusing on 
defects in the saddlebag tank, proposed alternative placement and designs which would maintain fuel system integrity. <em>In re: General Motors Corporation Pickup

In <i>Plotkin v. General Electric,</i>The Alexander Law Firm led the nation in charging General Electric with defrauding the American public in the sale of Energy 
Choice Light Bulbs which were claimed to be energy efficient, required less electricity and would preserve the environment. In actuality, the 100 watt replacement 
bulb was simply a dimmer 90 watt bulb and was sold for twice the price of a standard 100 watt bulb. Embarrassed by the public exposure of misconduct, General 
Electric readily settled this national class action. Forty-four million Energy Choice Light Bulbs sold over a two year period. Settlement provides for national

<p>$850,000 recovery for Cherie and Mark Collister as a result of being defrauded by Tulare County social workers when they adopted Katrina. The birth mother s 
history of schizophrenia, mental retardation, and institutional confinement was never revealed to the adopting parents, but aggressive trial preparation confirmed the 
county at all times knew the birth mother s history and the county s employees never advised the adopting parents of Katrina s debilitating disabilities. Because 
Katrina s schizophrenia was congenital and inevitable, Katrina was not harmed by the county s fraud. Mark and Cherie for opening their home and their hearts to 
this youngster were forced to suffer 10 years of living with a tragically mentally ill child. The parents recovery against the county represents the parents general 
damages for personal pain and suffering. <i>Collister v. County of Tulare</i>, Tulare County Superior Court Action No. 93-159371. Filed August, 1993; settled

<p>On Christmas Day, 1991 four teenage boys, Jason St. John, Christopher Benjamin, Jesse Cepeda and Edwin Martin, were burned to death when a 1978 four 
wheel drive Dodge Ramcharger over-turned at 20 miles per hour and landed on its roof in a creek bed. The case settled in April, 1994 after two years of extensive 
trial preparation which showed that Chrysler anticipated this vehicle would roll in the field and for that reason installed a rollbar in the passenger compartment, while 
allowing the rear mounted filler tube, which was bolted to sheet metal at the rear of the vehicle to remain unprotected in a rollover. None of the boys suffered any 
orthopedic injuries and this single vehicle crash would have been readily survivable if the fuel system had not failed. Chrysler knew that this covered pickup truck 
design lacked rear end structural stability, but nonetheless the company hard mounted the gas tank filler tube to the side of the vehicle that was sure to fail in a 
rollover. Other vehicles sold by Chrysler in 1978 had breakaway filler tubes to avoid the type of failure well documented in both full-size Fords [see Claudine 
Brown and Caryl Meslo v. Ford Motor Company above] and Pintos. We represented all four families. One of the most emotionally challenging cases we have 
encountered in twenty-five years of practice. This case is every parent s nightmare. These boys were doing nothing terribly wrong, had not been drinking and should 
have survived if the fuel system had performed properly. They were outstanding youngsters, good students, respected athletes, and full of live. For their families 
Christmas Day will never again be the same. The total recoveries at the request of both Chrysler Corporation and the families is not to be revealed. The amounts 
that were paid were those that I recommended. It was, and will always be, an honor to represent these families. <i>Howard and Mary St. John, Fran and Wendy

Discovery established that engine fires were caused by improper service work that resulted in dislocation of the power steering hoses and improper repositioning by 
mechanics. In a unique settlement, in which no class member released any claim, Ford agreed to issue a Technical Service Bulletin addressing this problem and to 
sell power steering hoses only in special boxes containing the TSB, all appropriate warnings and installation instructions with the appropriate heat shield and tie 
straps at a 30% discount. In addition the TSB was issued to all dealers and associations of mechanics. Total value of the benefit conferred is approximately 
$2,000,000. </p>
<p>The winter of 1993 left the Bay Area in sub-freezing temperatures but Caltrans did not give a second's thought to the fact that mountain springs that cross the Route 
17 south of San Jose would cover the roadway with ice well before the valley floor froze. Prior to January 3, 1993, a series of seven collisions occurred at the same 
location due to ice on the roadway. On the evening of January 3, Judith Manning was northbound on Route 17 when she lost control of her Jeep Cherokee as it slid 
across black, invisible ice and crossed the roadway where she invaded the path of Christopher Smith who was headed southbound. Smith died in the collision 
leaving a wife and three young children. We represented Ms. Manning who suffered a ruptured bladder, punctured lung and fractures of the pelvis and ribs. She 
obtained a recovery of $300,000 against the State. The Smith family recovered $725,000 against the State and $25,000 from Ms. Manning, leaving Ms. Manning 
with a net recovery of $275,000. Closed September 22, 1994. <i>Manning v. State of California</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court No. 731042. </p>
<p>In <i>Varvais v. State of California</i>, Kathleen Matheson was driving southbound of Highway 49 through a construction zone under contract with Granite 
Construction Company and supervised by Caltrans. Ms. Matheson s vehicle dropped four inches off the surfaced roadway onto the right shoulder. As she 
attempted to regain the road, she over corrected and turned directly into the path of the Varvais family. Both vehicles were travelling at 35-40 mph and all 
occupants were seat belted. In the collision of August 13, 1992, Kathleen Matheson and her two month old son Brennan were killed. We represented the Varvais 
family. Kristen Varvais, age 8, was killed. Cindy Varvais, mother and driver, suffered torn ankle ligaments, rib fractures, collapsed right lung and a sprained knee. 
Jordan Varvais, age 9, sustained a closed head injury, and fractures of the skull, T-6 [compression] and ankle. Lindsay Varvais, age 6, suffered limited physical 
injuries and emotional distress. Placer County is a rural county in the Sierra Mountain where the primary industries are lumber, cattle and summer recreation 
activities. The county has a history of pro-defendant verdicts, no recorded verdicts against the State Department of Transportation, and the handful of plaintiffs 
verdicts have been extremely low. A focus group showed conclusively that local residents appreciate and think highly of Caltrans, no matter what errors in 
supervision or judgment were made, and that local jurors were hostile to out- of-county visitors such as Ms. Matheson. The total recovery for the Varvais family 
was only $350,000 for total losses which would have been recognized as having a value of $1,000,000 or more in any major jurisdiction. Unfortunately cases 
against the State of California for defective roadways must be brought in the county where the loss occurred. Another law firm representing the Matheson losses 
was made a zero offer by the State and suffered a defense verdict in July, 1994, confirming our pre-trial analysis. <i>Varvais v. State of California</i>, Placer County 
No. SCV 01222. </p>
<p>A court-approved settlement of a consumer class action settlement against Bausch &amp; Lomb was announced on August 1, 1996. Under the settlement Bausch &amp; 
Lomb will pay up to $68 million in cash and products to 1.5 million buyers of the company's disposable lenses. Many wearers will receive from $25 to $50 in cash 
and $25 to $50 in coupons under the settlement as a result of a class-action filed in May 1994 which alleged that the company sold the same product under 
different brand names at widely varying prices and engaged in a fraudulent marketing scheme in order to gain market share in the disposal lens market. The result 
was that some consumers paid much more because they believed they were getting different lenses. <em>Roberts v. Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc.</em>,U.S. District Court, Northern 
District of Alabama, Western Division, No. CV-94-C-1144-W. See Wall Street Journal, November 2, 1994 and August 2, 1996 [B-2].</p>
<p>$500,000 recovery for the family of Edward Peterman, age 73, who lost his life on a rural road in San Benito County on February 24, 1994 when an employee of a 
car dealer fell asleep at the wheel and struck Mr. Peterman s pick-up head on. A retired Air Force colonel, he flew 65 missions over German occupied territory in 
WWII and was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Air Medal with nine clusters. Mr. Peterman was active as an 
insurance agent in the Gilroy area, maintained regular office hours and at the time of his death was delivering policies to customers. He was survived by his wife of 
27 years and two adult children: a college professor and a deputy county sheriff. Our clients elected to settle their claims for the available insurance policy limits in 
July, 1994 immediately prior to filing suit. We were proud to be selected to represent this family and to help them conclude their case in a dignified and prompt 
manner. </p>
<p>Confidential recovery in <i>Blair v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc.</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court, Consolidated Action Nos. 735492 and 736954. Kristin Blair, age 
21, daughter of Patricia and Randolph Blair, accepted a ride home from a Grateful Dead concert on August 23, 1993 in an Agency Rent-A-Car van that was 
driven by an unlicensed teenage driver. Agency Rent-A-Car held responsible for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. February, 1995.</p>
<p><i>Guerrant v. Forbricht</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court action number 729175, involved sexual harassment and molestation by a prostheticist, who would 
touch his stepdaughters at night while they slept and who installed a false heating vent for peeping into the youngsters' bathroom. Confidential recovery. April, 1995.</p>
<p>A $1,000,000 recovery for Nicole Freeburn represents only partial compensation for traumatic brain injury to a 16 year old who was thrown from a utility vehicle 
that carried five teenagers, but seatbelts for only four passengers. The owner and driver carried primary policy limits of $100,000/$300,000 and a $1,000,000 
excess policy was shared with another injured passenger. This case illustrates the need for everyone,especially parents of teenagers, to purchase and keep in force 
excess Uninsured/Underinsured coverage on their own vehicles. A family excess liability and underinsured insurance rider providing coverage in excess of 
$1,000,000 would have been extremely valuable in this case. <i>Freeburn v. Wehman</i>, Santa Clara County Superior Court action number 742048; consolidated with 
746364. Filed July 1994; settled May, 1995.</p>
<p>$750,000 recovery for the family of Joseph Pickering, a 38 year old high school teacher, who died in 1994. Mr. Pickering during the early 1970s was employed by 
Chevron at its pesticide bottling plant in California and was exposed to Weed-B-Gone. The main ingredients of this pesticide during the early 1970s were 2,4 D 
and 2,4,5 TP. A search of local homes produced twenty year old cans of Weed-B-Gone that when tested proved to be contaminated with dioxins and furans. Mr. 
Pickering died of a soft-tissue sarcoma which has been identified in medical literature as being associated with the contaminants found in this common household 
pesticide. This case again proved that chemical exposure cases are the most challenging and most expensive of the defective product cases. Mr. Pickering was 
survived by his wife and three children. All discovery was completed when this case settled in June, 1995 at the third pre-trial settlement conference conducted by 
Judge Daniel Weinstein, JAMS, San Francisco. <i>Pickering v. Chevron Chemical Company and Dow Chemical Company</i>, San Francisco Superior Court 
Action Nos. 938467 and 952025. (Posted June 27, 1995).</p>
<p>Chrysler Minivans. We are one of eight firms in the United States that filed suit seeking correction of defective rear hatch door lock failures in nominal impacts for 
3,300,000 owners of Chrysler minivans. Actions were filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court, U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and 
state courts in New York, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama. Because door locks are not subject to any federal motor vehicle safety standard, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration had limited authority to force a recall absent Chrysler's willingness to do so. Chrysler announced a &quot;service action&quot; and its intention to 
replace all such locks on March 27, 1995 the day before our motion for class certification was set to be heard in Santa Clara County Superior Court. These related 
class actions resulted in a negotiated settlement under which Chrysler became contractually bound to all owners of 1984 through 1995 Chrysler minivans to replace 
existing rear hatch door locks. Chrysler estimates that the total cost of this contractual recall is approximately $120,000,000. <em>Mann v. Chrysler Corporation</em> 
Santa Clara County Superior Court Action number CV 746017. The provisional settlement agreement of July 21, 1995 was given final approval by Judge Charles 
A. Legge on November 30, 1995, <em>Stuart Hanlon, et al v. Chrysler Corporation</em>, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 
95-2010 CAL. Despite several objections, Judge Legge held that the settlement was &quot;fair, reasonable and adequate.&quot; See The Recorder, December 1, 1995, page 
1; San Francisco Daily Journal, December 1, 1995, page 1. </p>
<p><a name="chemical"><img src="richchem.gif" alt="Richmond Chemical Plant Aerial View" align=right border=1 hspace=0 width=200 height=263></a> $180,000,000 Final Settlement. The Richmond Toxic Cloud class action litigation, Contra Costa County Superior Court, arose 
from the explosion of a tank car of oleum, concentrated sulfuric acid and sulfuric trioxide, in July, 1993 at the sulfuric acid 
manufacturing plant operated by General Chemical Company in Richmond, California. General Chemical was the sole provider of 
sulfuric acid to Chevron's Northern California gasoline refinery. In the aftermath of the explosion, which sent 12 tons of oleum into 
the atmosphere, 63,000 Californians were exposed and thousands were seen at hospital emergency rooms for chemical exposure. 
As one of seven firms appointed by the Court to manage this massive toxic chemical class action, our mission was to prove 
medical causation and the full range of injuries caused by this disaster and to serve as Chair, Science/Medical Causation 
Committee. As an active member of the Class Action Executive Committee and the Plaintiffs' Management Committee, which was 
responsible for overseeing and prosecuting this combined class and mass tort action, our responsibilities included formulating, 
planning and executing the organization of the plaintiffs' proof of scientific and medical evidence including the retention of a 
mutli-disciplinary team of meterologists, atmospheric scientists, and computer modeling scientists to conduct a detailed study of the 
sulfuric acid plume caused by the venting of acid into the atmosphere, participation in the execution of the computerized windfield 
and plume study to identify and replicate the path and concentrations of the cloud of sulfuric acid as it dispersed, selection and 
screening of class representatives for the Model Complaint, retention of experts in toxicology, occupational medicine, 
pulmonology and allergy medicine, participation in focus group presentations, preparing and appearing with our 14 class representatives at their depositions and 
active involvement in extended settlement discussions leading to the final recovery of $180,000,000. </p>
<p>In addition we conducted an aerial reconnaissance and inspection of General Chemical's sister facility in Wilmington, Delaware which revealed barns and sheds for 
housing tank cars, unlike the Richmond facililty where loading and unloading of tank cars occurred in the open. The settlement,which was negotiated during the 
winter and spring of 1995 was first announced on June 20, 1995 and reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury, Associated Press and PR Wire 
on June 21, 1995. The final approval hearing was held on October 27, 1995. The Court rendered its final decision confirming the settlement on November 13, 
1995. This outstanding result occurred as a result of a team effort that successfully proved outrageous misconduct in the heating of the tank car which exploded, 
carefully selected class representatives, diligently marshalled medical and scientific evidence and created a computerized program for reporting exposures and 
injuries for each of the 63,000 claimants. For more information see <em>In re GCC Richmond Works Case</em>, Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 2906, 
Contra Costa County Superior Court, Martinez, California. </p>
<p>On June 8, 1994 a 65 pound smoke bomb exploded on the campus of Palo Alto's Gunn High School causing serious injuries to two high school women and 
requiring medical treatment for 16 others. Because of decisions by the California Supreme Court which have denied insurance coverage for intentional conduct 
which accidentally results in unintended injury, collecting damages for the injured in this case was a challenge. We were happy to obtain recoveries of $100,000 and 
$50,000 for our clients. For a detailed report of this case see The Consumer Law Page &quot;Explosive Devices, Public Schools, and Lenient School Administrators:

<p>On March 29, 1993 Larry Kohler and Joe Orlando, business lines agents of Nationwide Insurance filed an action against Nationwide in the Superior Court of the 
State of California for the County of San Francisco which was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, <em>Lawrence B. Kohler and 
Joseph Orlando v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Employers Insurance of Wausau, et al</em>, Civil Action No. C 93-1584 SC alleging that Nationwide 
engaged in various acts including breached their contract for failure to pay delayed compensation, for improper chargebacks to extended earnings payments, by 
making changes in the Nationwide contract, breached their implied-in-fact contract for good cause termination, breached an implied-in-fact contract for exclusivity 
and alleging that Wausau tortiously interfered with contract. After completing all discovery, prior to the January, 1996 trial date, a settlement conference before the 
Honorable Eugene Lynch resulted in an amicable settlement which is confidential. In January, 1996, Nationwide Insurance and Employers Insurance of Wausau 
retained The Alexander Law Firm to furnish advisory and consulting services for a period of five years. Under the retainer agreement the firm is not 
prohibited from representing any party in an action against an insured of Nationwide or Wausau in which the issues or facts litigated in Kohler and Orlando are not 
in issue. Nationwide, the fifth largest casualty insurer in the United States with total assets of $35 billion, has issued public reports confirming its retention of 
The Alexander Law Firm. </p>
<p>Allstate Insurance Agents. With our co-counsel we represented 1,809 California Allstate Insurance agents who had not been reimbursed for the cost of maintaining 
Allstate offices under R830, R1500 or R3000 employment contracts between January 1, 1990 and April 30, 1996. Although these agents legally were employees 
of Allstate, Allstate required them to personally pay for the costs of operating company offices under its Neighborhood Office Agency program. Under the 
California Labor Code, employees cannot be forced to pay for an employers' business expenses as a condition of employment. In January, 1995 the court certified 
this case as a class action and final settlement was approved on March 20,1996. With the settlement of this case Allstate simultaneously decided to convert all 
employee agents to independent contractors in order to operate its agent network in conformance with California law. Of the total of 2,288 agents, 304, 
representing 13% of the agent force, have chosen to opt-out of the settlement and to pursue individual claims against Allstate. Under class action procedures, the 
filing of a class action tolls every class ' statute of limitations and the opt-out agents are now able to go forward at this late date to attempt through their individual 
attorneys to litigate with Allstate over reimbursement terms and to contest Allstate's changing their status from employees to independent contractors. Although on 
this latter issue, in response to the objection of several agents, the National Labor Relations Board has concluded that Allstate's decision was made for lawful 
business reasons. By mid-June, 1996 1,334 of 1,809 claimants had received reimbursements of $6,170,000. In addition to receiving reimbursement of office 
operating expenses, one of the benefits of the settlement is the recognition of the agent's ownership interest in his book of business one year from the date of 
conversion to independent contractor status. Without the settlement an agent would have had to wait five years from conversion under Allstate's previous rules in 
order to be able to sell his or her book of business acquired prior to conversion. Many agents are expected to sell their book of business to other agents in the 
Spring of 1997. This case is the second case for insurance agents that we concluded in 1996 [see<em> Kohler and Orlando v. Nationwide</em>]. In re Insurance Agent 
Cases I and II, J. C. C.P.Nos. 2984 and 2985, Alameda County Superior Court before Hon. Joseph Carson.</p>

SANTA CLARA COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION
CODE OF PROFESSIONALISM

Adopted June 1992

PREAMBLE

	Members of the Santa Clara County Bar Association have practiced
law with a level of professionalism that goes well beyond the requirements
of the State Bar mandated Code of Professional Conduct.  To make that level
of professionalism the standard for practice in Santa Clara County, this
Code of Professionalism is adopted to apply to all attorneys who practice
in Santa Clara County because, as lawyers, they owe duties of
professionalism to their clients, opposing parties and their counsel, the
courts and other tribunals, and the public as a whole.  Those duties
include among others:  civility, professional integrity, personal dignity,
candor, diligence, respect, courtesy, cooperation, and competence.

	This Code is structured to provide a general guiding principle in
each area addressed followed by specific examples which are not intended to
be all encompassing.

	Attorneys are encouraged to comply with the spirit of these tenets
and not simply blindly adhere to the strict letter of these tenets.  The
goals stated herein are equally applicable to all lawyers regardless of
area of practice.

	This Code should be read against the context of the lawyer's
underlying duty to zealously represent the lawyer's client.  Nothing in
this Code should be read to denigrate the lawyer's duty of zealous
representation.  However, all lawyers are encouraged to zealously represent
their clients within the highest bounds of professionalism.

SECTION 1
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PUBLIC

	A lawyer should always be mindful that the law is a learned
profession and that among its goals are devotion to public service,
improvement of the administration of justice, and the contribution of
uncompensated time and civic influence on behalf of persons who cannot
afford adequate legal assistance.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should contribute time on a pro bono basis to community
activities;

b.      A lawyer should become actively involved in organized activities
designed to improve the courts, the legal system and the practice of law;

c.      A lawyer should donate legal services to individuals unable to
afford those services.

SECTION 2
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE CLIENT

	A lawyer should work to achieve his or her client's lawful and
meritorious objectives expeditiously and as economically as possible.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should be committed to his or her client's cause, but
should not permit that loyalty to interfere with giving the client
objective and independent advice.

b.      A lawyer should advise his or her client against pursuing
litigation (or any other course of action) that does not have merit.

SECTION 3
SCHEDULING

	A lawyer should understand and advise his or client that civility
and courtesy in scheduling meetings, hearings, and discovery are expected
and not to be equated with weakness.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should make reasonable efforts to schedule meetings,
hearings, and discovery by agreement whenever possible and should consider
the scheduling interests of opposing counsel, the parties, witnesses, and
the court.  Misunderstandings should be avoided by sending formal notice
after agreement is reached.

b.      A lawyer should not arbitrarily or unreasonably withhold consent to
a request for schedulig accommodations.

c.      A lawyer should not engage in delay tactics in scheduling meetings,
hearings and discovery.

d.      A lawyer should try to verify the availability of key participants
and witnesses either before a meeting, hearing or trial date is set or if
that is not feasible, immediately after so that he or she can promptly
notify the court, or other tribunal, and opposing counsel of any likely
problems.

e.      A lawyer should notify opposing counsel and, if appropriate, the
court or other tribunal as early as possible when scheduled meetings,
hearings or depositions must be canceled or rescheduled.

SECTION 4
CONTINUANCES AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME

	Consistent with existing law and court orders, a lawyer should
agree to reasonable requests for extensions of time when the legitimate
interests of his or her client will not be adversely affected.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should agree to reasonable requests for extensions of time
or continuances without requiring motions or other formalities.

b.      A lawyer should agree as a matter of courtesy to first requests for
reasonable extensions of time unless time is of the essence and even if the
counsel requesting it previously refused to grant an extension.

c.      A lawyer should, after agreeing to a first extension, consider
additional requests for time by balancing the need for prompt resolution of
matters against the consideration which should be extended to an opponent's
professional and personal schedule, the opponent's willingness to grant
reciprocal extensions, the time actually needed for the task, and whether
it is likely a court would grant the extension if asked to do so.

d.      A lawyer should be committed to and advise clients that the
strategy of not agreeing to reasonable requests for time extensions simply
to appear &quot;tough&quot; is inappropriate.

e.      A lawyer should not seek extensions or continuances for the purpose
of harassment or extending litigation.

f.      A lawyer should not condition an agreement to an extension on
unfair and extraneous terms except those a lawyer is entitled to impose,
such as preserving rights that an extension might jeopardize or seeking
reciprocal scheduling concessions.

g.      A lawyer should not, by agreeing to extensions, seek to cut off an
opponent's substantive rights, such as his or her right to move against a
complaint.

h.      A lawyer should agree to reasonable requests for extensions of time
when new counsel is substituted in for prior counsel.

SECTION 5
SERVICE OF PAPERS

	The timing and manner of service of papers should not be calculated
to disadvantage or embarrass the party receiving the papers.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should not serve documents, pleadings, or motions on the
opposing party or counsel at a time or in a way that would unfairly limit
the other party's opportunity to respond.

b.      A lawyer should not serve papers so close to a court appearance
that it inhibits the ability of opposing counsel to prepare for that
appearance or to respond to the papers, if permitted by law.

c.      A lawyer should not serve papers simply to take advantage of an
opponent's known absence from the office or at a time or in a manner
designed to inconvenience an adversary, such as late on Friday afternoon or
the day preceding a secular or religious holiday.

d.      A lawyer should serve papers by personal delivery or by facsimile
transmission when it is likely that service by mail, even when allowed,
will prejudice the opposing party.

e.      A lawyer should serve papers on the individual attorney known to be
responsible for the matter and at his or her principal place of work.

f.      A lawyer should never use the mode, timing or place of serving
papers primarily to embarrass a party or witness.

SECTION 6
PUNCTUALITY

	A lawyer should be punctual in communications with others and in
honoring scheduled appearances.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should arrive sufficiently in advance of trials, hearings,
meetings, depositions, or other scheduled events so that preliminary
matters can be resolved.

b.      A lawyer should timely notify all other participants when, for a
reason beyond his or her control, the lawyer will be unavoidably late.

c.      A lawyer should timely notify the other participants when he or she
is aware that a participant will be late for a scheduled event.

SECTION 7
WRITINGS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT
including but not exclusively briefs, memoranda, affidavits and declarations

	Written materials submitted to the court should always be factual,
concise, and accurately state current law and fairly represent the parties'
position without unfairly attacking the opposing party or opposing counsel.

Specifically:

a.      Facts that are not properly introduced in the case and part of the
record in the case should not be used in written briefs or memoranda of
points and authorities.

b.      A lawyer should avoid degrading the intelligence, ethics, morals,
integrity, or personal behavior of the opposing party, counsel or witness
unless such matters are at issue in the proceeding.

SECTION 8
COMMUNICATIONS WITH ADVERSARIES

	A lawyer should at all times be civil, courteous, and accurate in
communicating with adversaries, whether in writing or orally.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should not draft letters assigning to an opposing party a
position that party has not taken or to create a &quot;record&quot; of events that
have not occurred.

b.      A lawyer should sparingly use letters intended only to make a
record and then only when the lawyer thinks it necessary given all the
circumstances.

c.      A lawyer should not send a letter addressed to opposing counsel to
the judge unless specifically permitted or invited by the court.

SECTION 9
DISCOVERY

	A lawyer should not use any form of discovery, the scheduling of
discovery, or any other part of the discovery process as a means of
harassing opposing counsel or the opposing party or as a means of delaying
the timely, efficient and cost effective resolution of a dispute.

Specifically:

a.      As to Depositions:
(1)     A lawyer should take depositions only where actually needed to
learn facts or information or to preserve testimony.
(2)     In scheduling depositions, a lawyer should within reason
accommodate schedules of opposing counsel and the deponent, where it is
possible to do so without prejudicing the client's rights.
(3)     When a deposition is scheduled and noticed by another party for the
reasonably near future, a lawyer should ordinarily not schedule another
deposition for an earlier date without the agreement of opposing counsel.
(4)     A lawyer should not delay a deposition for bad faith purposes but
only if necessary to meet real scheduling problems.
(5)     A lawyer should not ask questions about a deponent's personal
affairs or question a deponent's integrity where such questions are
irrelevant to the subject matter of the deposition.
(6)     A lawyer should avoid repetitive or argumentative questions or
those asked solely for the purpose of harassment.
(7)     A lawyer representing a deponent or representing another party
should limit objections to those that are well founded and necessary for
the protection of the client's interest.  A lawyer should remember that
most objections are preserved and need be made only when the form of a
question is defective or privileged information is sought.
(8)     Once a question is asked, a lawyer should not, through objections
or otherwise, coach the deponent or suggest answers.
(9)     A lawyer should not direct a deponent to refuse to answer a
question unless the question seeks privileged information or is manifestly
irrelevant or calculated to harass.
(10)    Lawyers for all parties should refrain from self-serving speeches
during depositions.
(11)    Lawyers should not engage in any conduct during a deposition that
would not be allowed in the presence of a judicial officer.

b.      As to Document Demands:
(1)     A lawyer should limit demands for production of documents to
documents actually and reasonably believed to be needed for the prosecution
or defense of an action and demands should not be made to harass or
embarrass a party or witness or to impose an inordinate burden or expense
in responding.
(2)     A lawyer should not draft demands for document production so
broadly that it encompasses documents clearly not relevant to the subject
matter of the case.
(3)     In responding to document demands, a lawyer should not interpret
the request in an artificially restrictive manner in an attempt to avoid
disclosure.
(4)     A lawyer responding to document demands shouldwithhold documents on
the grounds of privilege only where appropriate.
(5)     A lawyer should not produce documents in a disorganized or
unintelligible fashion, or in a way calculated to hide or obscure the
existence of particular documents.
(6)     A lawyer should not delay producing documents to prevent opposing
counsel from inspecting documents prior to scheduled depositions or for any
other tactical reason.

c.      As to Interrogatories:
(1)     A lawyer should use interrogatories sparingly and never to harass
or impose undue burden or expense on the opposing party.
(2)     A lawyer should not read or respond to interrogatories in an
artificial manner designed to assure that answers are not truly responsive.
(3)     A lawyer should not object to interrogatories except when a good
faith belief exists in the merit of the objection.  Objections should not
be made for the purpose of withholding relevant information.  If an
interrogatory is objectionable only in part, a lawyer should answer the
unobjectionable portion.

SECTION 10
MOTION PRACTICE

	Motions should be filed sparingly, only in good faith and when the
issue cannot be otherwise resolved.

Specifically:

a.      Before filing a motion, a lawyer should engage in more than a mere
pro forma effort to resolve the issue.

b.      A lawyer should not engage in conduct which forces opposing counsel
to file a motion and then not oppose the motion.

SECTION 11
DEALING WITH NONPARTY WITNESSES

	Dealings with nonparty witnesses should be courteous and designed
to leave that witness with an appropriately good impression of the legal
system.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should not issue subpoenas to nonparty witnesses except in
connection with their appearance at a hearing, trial or deposition.

b.      Deposition subpoenas should be accompanied by notices of deposition
with copies to all counsel.

c.      Where a lawyer obtains documents pursuant to a deposition subpoena,
copies of the documents should be made available to all other counsel at
his or her expense even if the deposition is canceled or adjourned.

SECTION 12
EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE COURT

	A lawyer should avoid ex parte communications on the substance of a
pending case with a judge (or his or her law clerk) before whom such case
is pending.

Specifically:

a.      Even when applicable laws or rules permit an ex parte application
or communication to the court, before making such an application or
communication, a lawyer should make diligent efforts to notify the opposing
party or a lawyer known to represent or likely to represent the opposing
party and should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the schedule of
such lawyer to permit the opposing party to be represented.

b.      Where rules permit an ex parte application or communication to the
court in an emergency situation, a lawyer should make such an application
or communication (including an application to shorten an otherwise
applicable time period) only where there is a bona fide emergency such that
the lawyer's client will be seriously prejudiced if the application or
communication were made with regular notice.

SECTION 13
SETTLEMENT AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

	A lawyer should raise and explore the issue of settlement and
alternative dispute resolution in every case as soon as the case can be
evaluated.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should always attempt to de-escalate any controversy and
bring the parties together.

b.      A lawyer should not falsely hold out the possibility of settlement
as a means for terminating discovery or delaying trial.

c.      In every case, a lawyer should consider whether the client's
interest could be adequately served and the controversy more expeditiously
and economically disposed of by arbitration, mediation or other form of
alternative dispute resolution.

d.      A lawyer should advise the client at the outset of the availability
of alternative dispute resolution.

SECTION 14
TRIALS AND HEARINGS

	A lawyer should conduct himself or herself in trial and hearings in
a manner which promotes a positive image of the profession, assists the
court in properly reviewing the case, and displays appropriate respect for
the justice system.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should be punctual and prepared for all court appearances.

b.      A lawyer should always deal with parties, counsel, witnesses,
jurors or prospective jurors, court personnel and the judge with courtesy
and civility.

c.      A lawyer in making objections during a trial or hearing should do
so for legitimate and good faith reasons and should not make such
objections only for the purpose of harassment or delay.

d.      A lawyer should honor requests made by opposing counsel during
trial which do not prejudice his or her client's rights or sacrifice
tactical advantage.

SECTION 15
DEFAULT

	A lawyer should not seek an opposing party's default to obtain a
judgment or substantive order without giving that opposing party sufficient
advance written warning to allow the opposing party to cure the default.

SECTION 16
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH JUDICIAL OFFICERS
OR COURT APPOINTED EXPERTS

	A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety or bias in
relationships with judicial officers and independent, court appointed
experts.

Specifically:

a.      When a lawyer is assigned to appear before a judicial officer with
whom the lawyer has a social relationship or friendship beyond normal
professional association the lawyer should notify opposing counsel (or an
unrepresented party) of the relationship.

b.      A lawyer should disclose to opposing counsel (or an unrepresented
opposing party) any social relationship or friendship between the lawyer
and any independent, court appointed expert taking a role in the case, so
that opposing counsel or party has the opportunity to object to such expert
receiving the assignment.

SECTION 17
PRIVACY

	All matters should be handled with due respect for the rights of
privacy of parties and non-parties.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer should not inquire into, nor attempt to use, nor threaten
to use, facts about the private lives of any party or other individuals for
the purpose of gaining a psychological advantage in a case.  This rule does
not preclude inquiry into sensitive matters which are relevant to an issue,
as long as the inquiry is pursued as narrowly as reasonably possible and
with due respect for the fact that an invasion into private matters is a
necessary evil.

b.      If it is necessary for a lawyer to inquire into such matters, the
lawyer should cooperate in arranging for protective measures designed to
assure that the information revealed is disclosed only to those persons who
need it in order to present the relevant evidence to the court.

SECTION 18
COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THE LEGAL SYSTEM
AND WITH PARTICIPANTS

	Lawyers should conduct themselves with clients, opposing counsel
and parties, and the public in a manner consistent with the high respect
and esteem which they should have for the courts, the civil and criminal
justice systems, and the legal profession and its members.

Specifically:

a.      A lawyer's public communications should at all times and under all
circumstances reflect appropriate civility, professional integrity,
personal dignity, and respect for the legal system.  This rule does not
prohibit good faith, factually based expressions of dissent or criticism
made by a lawyer in public or private discussions having a purpose to
motivate improvements in our legal system or professions.

b.      A lawyer should not make statements which are false, misleading, or
which exaggerate, for example, the amount of damages sought in a lawsuit,
actual or potential recoveries in settlement or the lawyer's
qualifications, experience, or fees.

c.      A lawyer should not fail or refuse without justification to respond
promptly by returning phone calls or otherwise responding to the calls and
letters of his or her clients and/or opposing counsel.

d.      A lawyer who is serving as a prosecutor or defense counsel should
conduct him or herself publicly and within the context of a particular case
in a manner that shows respect for the important functions that each plays
within the criminal justice system, keeping in mind that the defense of an
accused is important and valuable to society as is the prosecution.

SECTION 19
NEGOTIATION OF BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS

	A lawyer should ensure that all business transactions are
negotiated, documented and consummated in an atmosphere of cooperation and
informed mutual agreement.

Specifically:

a.      In non-confrontational transactional settings, with client
approval, lawyers should consider given each other permission to contact
the employees of the other party for the purpose of promptly and
efficiently obtaining the information and documents necessary to complete
the transaction.  When granted such permission, a lawyer should not use the
contact to communicate on any issue in controversy or to gain any advantage
&quot;against&quot; that party or their attorney.

b.      A lawyer should not encourage a party with superior knowledge or
negotiating position to take unfair advantage of the other party.

SECTION 20
REDLINING

	A lawyer should clearly identify, for other counsel or parties, all
changes that a lawyer makes in documents.</pre>

<hr>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm represents individuals, consumers and small businesses from across the U.S. who have suffered damage. Every day we are asked to 
participate in many cases. While we are approached on far more cases than we can accept, we welcome your inquiries and if we can help we will. </p>
<p>Our expertise is in negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, environmental, mass accident and fraud cases. As you know from the information provided on <a href="talf.html">our 
home page</a> we do not prosecute frivolous cases and offer a substantial range of experience which is far beyond that of the traditional plaintiffs' law firm. Our 
philosophy and our record is set forth in detail on this website and we encourage prospective clients to study our record and compare it with others when needing a 
lawyer. It is difficult finding the &quot;right&quot; lawyer for a particular case, but it is an ultimately important decision. If we are not the &quot;right&quot; lawyer for you, we may know 
the &quot;right&quot; lawyer near you who can help you. To help you find the right lawyer we have written an article explaining an approach that will make sure you are getting 
advice from a well qualified and experienced professional: <a href="txt/article/howhire.shtml">How to Hire the &quot;Right Lawyer&quot;: Consumers' Rights on the Legal Marketplace. </a></p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm represents plaintiffs in cases of serious injuries, wrongful death and in <a href="txt/complain.html#class">class action lawsuits</a> against national and multi-national companies in 
both federal and state courts. A class action is an extremely powerful tool to hold a wrongdoer accountable in circumstances where an individual case would be 
inefficient or uneconomical. To review our experience in a wide range of cases, check our <a href="cases.html">record</a>.</p>
<p>We carefully investigate all prospective cases before filing suit. We do not accept frivolous lawsuits, because unless we are successful, we are not paid. After the 
successful conclusion of a class action, we petition the court to order the wrongdoer to pay our attorneys fees on behalf of the class and to pay the cost of 
prosecuting the case. In cases in which a common fund has been created to benefit class members, we petition the court to allocate a percentage of the recovery as 
attorneys fees, much the same as in our individual cases.</p>
<p>We accept cases for individuals on a contingency basis. We agree to pay all trial preparation costs necessary to prosecute a case and are only paid for our services 
if, and when, we are successful. We do not send bills or ask for retainers. As long as our clients follow our advice, if there is no recovery in either a class action or 
in an individual case, there is no charge for attorneys fee and the costs of prosecuting a case are our responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>To determine whether or not you have a case that we can accept, we need to know about you, the damages you suffered, the persons that caused the damage and 
what you hope to achieve by working with a qualified lawyer on your problem.</p>
<p>The information you provide in this online questionnaire will be kept confidential and will be sent directly to the electronic mail center of The Alexander Law Firm. 
After we receive your inquiry, we will contact you to discuss how we can help you.</p>
<p>Remember, the Internet is not confidential. We do not believe that the large volume of individual email on the net is monitored, but if you prefer unquestioned 
confidentiality you can address a letter to The Alexander Law Firm, P. O. Box 1330, San Jose, CA 95109-1330 or fax to 408.287.1776 providing the information 
requested below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Alexander of The Alexander Law Firm was designated as the Chairman of the Medical Causation

<h3><a href="cb-intro.html">The National Consumer Complaint Center</a> for Food, Drugs, Cosmetics, Medical Devices, 
Radiation-emitting Electronic Products, Veterinary Drugs and Feeds</h3>
<hr>
<p>Before you report a product that you suspect caused an illness or injury, ask yourself the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Did you use the product for other than its intended purpose? </li>
<li>Did you fail to follow carefully the instructions for the product? </li>
<li>Was the product old or outdated? </li>
<li>Do you have an allergy or other medical condition that might have something to do with the suspected harmful effect? </li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to any of these questions, it's unlikely that reporting the problem will be of any benefit. (Nevertheless, you 
should, of course, get proper medical care for your injury, if necessary.) Otherwise, report any complaint concerning the 
following: </p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Report any product, including seafood and dairy products (but not meat or poultry if it is unsafe, decomposed, filthy, or defective; 
contains foreign substances or particles, such as hair or insects; is not properly labeled; is processed or stored under insanitary

        represent The Alexander Law Firm commits its best
        efforts. Those efforts over the years are reported here.
        Each case was dependent on a multiplicity of factors and
        unique facts. Because of many different factors, results
        always will differ from case to case. For that reason the
        results that we obtained in these cases are no guarantee
        that we can again achieve the same results in any future
        case. In fact to understand what we achieved in these
        cases we have provided a substantial amount of
        information, including references to news articles and
        court files, so anyone can evaluate and make their own
        determination of the result and our record. There is only
        common factor in all the cases reported here: the
        plaintiff was represented by Richard Alexander or The

<hr>
<p><font size=5>E</font>ach year, millions of consumers experience problems with a product or service. There are several strategies for resolving those complaints. First contact the seller. 
If that does not work, contact a consumer complaint agency. If that does not bring satisfaction, consider other options, such as arbitration or filing a lawsuit. This 
article begins with the assumption that you do not yet need a lawyer to help you. If you are sure you need a lawyer open &quot;<a href="article/howhire.shtml">How to Hire the Right Lawyer</a>&quot; and 
&quot;<a href="article/legalfee.shtml">Understanding the Legal Fee Agreement</a>.&quot; There are many lawyers with many different levels of expertise and experience, who practice in widely different arenas. 
You will want someone with specific experience in prosecuting a specific case for you. These two related articles explain how an experienced lawyer goes about 
finding the &quot;right lawyer&quot; for a particular case and what you can and should expect in negotiating a contract for legal services. </p>
<h4>CONTACT THE SELLER </h4>
<p>Whether your problem is a defective hair dryer or a leak in your newly installed roof, the first step in resolving your problem is to contact the merchant who sold you 
the product or service. Most consumer complaints are settled at this level.</p>
<p>But first be prepared.</p>
<p>Always make a record and document what went wrong with a letter, by taking photos or by having your neighbor confirm that the ceiling under the new roof was 
leaking after the rain. Save boxes, brochures, and other written materials that were provided by the seller or contractor.</p>
<p>For a detailed list of considerations in cases of defective products, open the article on The Consumer Law Page entitled <a href="article/product.shtml">Preparing the Defective Product Case</a>.</p>
<p>Gather together all relevant documents, such as receipts, cancelled checks, photographs, credit card bills, warranties, contracts, brochures, package inserts or bills 
of sale. Think about what you would accept as a reasonable resolution of your complaint. Do you want your money back, or would a store credit suffice? Would 
you accept a replacement item? Can the product be repaired? Think through your goal.</p>
<p>In approaching the seller, call first, indicate that you have a complaint, and ask to make an appointment with the appropriate person, typically the store manager or 
customer service representative. At that meeting, explain as briefly and accurately as possible both the nature of the problem and what you want the merchant to do. 
Be firm, but polite, avoiding displays of temper. (If it's not possible or practical to meet with the business, you can try calling or writing.)</p>
<p>If this proves unsuccessful, take your complaint to the person on the next rung up the chain of command. This may be the supervisor or manager, the store owner if 
the store is locally owned, the corporate consumer complaint department, or even the president or CEO of the company. You may also decide at this point to 
pursue your complaint through the manufacturer, rather than through the merchant, particularly if your problem is covered by a warranty.</p>
<p>At this stage, you should put your complaint in writing. Your one- to two-page letter should be polite, well organized, and either typed or written legibly in ink. It 
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, address, home and work phone numbers (and when you can generally be reached at those numbers), and your account number, if appropriate; </li>
<li>a brief statement of the important facts concerning your purchase, including when and where you made the purchase, and specific information about the item 
in question, including make and model and serial number, if applicable; </li>
<li>if your compliant involves a service, a description of the service and the name of the person who performed it; </li>
<li>a brief statement describing your problem with that product or service; </li>
<li>a description of what you have already done to try to resolve your complaint and the response you received; and </li>
<li>what you want the merchant to do and a reasonable time period for a response.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should include copies, not originals, of all documents related to your complaint, and you should keep a copy of your letter for your files. Also, be sure to keep 
copies of any correspondence you receive from the company, and keep dated notes on any telephone conversations you may have regarding the complaint. This 
documentation could determine your success or failure if you need to take your complaint further.</p>
<h4>CONTACT A COMPLAINT AGENCY</h4>
<p>In most cases, contacting the seller or manufacturer will produce a satisfactory resolution to your complaint. When the merchant and manufacturer are not 
cooperative, however, you can seek assistance from a government or non-profit complaint agency. Your phone director or local library often lists these 
organizations. It is best to contact them individually, instead of copying one letter to many agencies.</p>
<h4>State, County, and City Consumer Protection Offices</h4>
<p>In most states, there are agencies that can assist in resolving consumer complaints. These agencies may be in independent state, county or city offices, the governor's 
office, the county District Attorney's or City Attorney's office, or the Attorney General's office. It is important to notify these governmental consumer protection 
offices of any complaints. Consumer complaints that report abusive practices or indicate an on-going pattern of fraud are often the basis of investigations and 
changes in the law.</p>
<p>Contact the agency first by phone, since most will want to mail you a complaint form to use in filing your complaint. You will also need to provide copies, not 
originals, of relevant documents, and you will need to describe what you have already done to resolve your complaint. If your complaint involves a business in 
another state, you may be referred to a consumer office in that state.</p>
<h4>Better Business Bureaus</h4>
<p>Better Business Bureaus (BBBs) are non-profit organizations, sponsored by local businesses, that promote good relations between buyers and sellers. While BBBs 
have no authority to force even their members to resolve complaints, most will at least contact the merchant, and some offer more formal binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Most BBBs prefer that you call first, so that they can determine whether your complaint is within their jurisdiction and, if so, mail you a complaint form. Once it has 
received your completed form, the BBB generally will contact the company for its response and try to negotiate a solution. If this effort does not resolve your 
problem, some BBBs will also offer arbitration, in which both you and the merchant agree to let a neutral third party decide on a fair resolution.</p>
<p>For more information about BBS, open the <a href="resource/index.html">Resources Section of The Consumer Law Page</a>. </p>
<h4>Consumer Action Hotlines</h4>
<p>In some communities a television news program, radio talk show host, or newspaper columnist will offer a hotline to help resolve consumer complaints. These 
services use the leverage of media exposure to encourage stubborn businesses to respond.</p>
<h4>Other Non-Profit Organizations</h4>
<p>A variety of other non-profit organizations try to resolve consumer problems. They include legal clinics associated with law schools and grassroots community 
organizations.</p>
<h4>Federal Agencies</h4>
<p>Most federal agencies do not handle individual consumer complaints. But it is important for you to bring complaints to their attention so that they can take any 
appropriate legal or regulatory actions to prevent future problems. Do not hesitate to report defective products to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
Report defective automobiles to the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. For more information about these agencies 
open the Resources Section of The Consumer Law Page.</p>
<h4>Industry Trade Associations </h4>
<p>Some industry trade associations offer assistance in resolving complaints pertaining to their members. The assistance offered usually resembles the information 
mediation provided by BBBs. Some of the better established services of this type include the Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel (1-800-621-0477) and the 
Direct Marketing Association Mail Order Action Line (written complaints only to Mail Order Action Line, 6 East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017).</p>
<p>Certain products and services are under the separate jurisdiction of specific state agencies.</p>
<h4>Banking</h4>
<p>Every state has a banking division which regulates state banks. Many will help consumers resolve complaints involving state-chartered banks.</p>
<h4>Insurance</h4>
<p>Consumers with complaints involving insurance companies or agents can get assistance from the state insurance division.</p>
<h4>Investments</h4>
<p>Every state has a securities division to regulate securities investments. If you have a complaint about a broker, investment adviser, financial planner, or a specific 
investment product, call your securities division for assistance.</p>
<h4>Electric, Gas, or Telephone Company</h4>
<p>In each state, the Public Utility Commission or Public Service Commission assists consumers with complaints involving public utilities. In some states, these utility 
commissions also regulate and handle consumer complaints against in-state moving, trucking, charter buses, and airport shuttle vehicles. In addition, some states 
have Consumer Utility Boards that will help consumers resolve their utility complaints.</p>
<h4>Licensed Trades</h4>
<p>Many states license certain trades, particularly building trades, such as general contractors, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. In some states, the departments 
which license these trades will assist consumers to resolve their complaints about licenses.</p>
<h4>New Car</h4>
<p>Every state but South Dakota and Arkansas has a &quot;lemon law&quot; establishing procedures to resolve complaints involving chronic car problems. These state laws 
specify the number of days and repair attempts needed to qualify. Contact your state consumer protection agency for information on the state's lemon law. Some 
states also have lemon laws covering used cars.</p>
<h4>Mail Order</h4>
<p>Postal inspectors assist consumers in resolving mail order problems as well as with fraud cases in which the mails are used in any way to advance the fraud. Contact 
the postal inspector (not the Post Master), whom you will find listed under the Postal Service in the U.S. Government listings or in the white pages of the phone 
book.</p>
<h4>FILE A LAWSUIT</h4>
<p>If all else fails, consider pursuing your complaint in court, either through small claims court or, if the amount of money involved is large, through a civil lawsuit.</p>
<h4>Small Claims Court</h4>
<p>Located in nearly every county and city, small claims courts provide a relatively fast, efficient, and inexpensive way to resolve consumer problems. Most accept 
claims up to several thousand dollars and allow consumers to present their own case without the assistance of an attorney. In fact, in some states lawyers are not 
permitted in small claims court. Many of these courts and some consumer agencies make available written material about the small claims process and how to 
prepare for it.</p>
<p>When your case is called, you will have a chance to explain your problem to a judge in the presence of the subjects of your complaint. After hearing both sides of 
the case, and reviewing any written evidence provided, the judge will make a decision. Be aware that collecting small claims court awards may be difficult and 
include additional costs. Consult the court or your consumer agency about how best to ensure payment.</p>
<h4>Finding the &quot;Right&quot; Lawyer for a Civil Suit</h4>
<p>If your claim exceeds the small claims court limit, consider pursuing it through a civil suit. For such a suit, you will need a lawyer.</p>
<p>To find a lawyer, you can ask friends or any professionals you know for recommendations. If you have a low income, you may be able to get help from the legal aid 
or legal services office. Also, check to see if your employment benefits include a group legal services plan.</p>
<p>Finding the &quot;right&quot; lawyer for your case will be a significant challenge and it will take time. Your goal is to find someone who has experience representing consumers 
in cases involving commercial fraud or defective products. A lawyer experienced in consumer litigation will have immediate answers to your questions, will not 
postpone providing advice, will not promise to &quot;think about it,&quot; and will not have to conduct any research before making recommendations. In short, the lawyer you 
want will be an expert.</p>
<p>First, plan to devote 16 to 24 hours finding the right lawyer. This is a difficult task. Stay with it. Avoid most county bar referral programs which may or may not be 
manned by the &quot;right&quot; person. Despite advertising, most lawyers live behind letterheads that tell consumers absolutely nothing about what they do and their areas of 
speciality.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is becoming an excellent sources of information for consumers who need lawyers with special skills. Check the law lists on the World Wide 
Web. These lists are growing daily. You need URL capability through Mosaic or Netscape both of which are freely available. One of the best is <a href="http://seamless.com">The Seamless 
Web</a>. Also see, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Law.html">Einet</a>, <a href="http://www.dorsai.org/p-law/">P-Law</a> and <a href="http://www.westpub.com/WLDInfo/WLD.htm">West's Law Directory</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the home page of <a href="http://seamless.com/alexanderlaw">The Alexander Law Firm</a>. </p>
<p>Look for a lawyer with the same dedication, commitment, experience and record of success in the types of case that you have that is shown there. Dedicated 
lawyers who are fiercely proud of their record of success can be found across the country, but you have to search them out. Take the time to find the &quot;right&quot; lawyer 
and you will not regret the effort that it takes.</p>
<p>In addition, America Online's Court TV provides a database of lawyers and if your local newspaper is online, a search of that database can provide information 
about lawyers with special background and experience. For a detalied description of how to conduct your search read <a href="article/howhire.shtml">How to Find the &quot;Right&quot; Lawyer: Consumer 
Rights in the Legal Marketplace</a> here on The Consumer Law Page.</p>
<p>Be creative. Start with a trip to the local county law library. Find out if the state bar organization in your state has a section or group of attorneys who deal with your 
issue. Local and state bar association have groups or sections of lawyers interested in special areas of the law. Once you identify a section that meets your needs, 
call the section chair directly and ask for referrals. Most states require lawyers to attend Continuing Legal Education courses. Lawyers in charge of these programs 
are excellent sources of referrals. Open Martindale-Hubbell at the county law library to find specialists. This is a national rating guide and many lawyers provide 
detailed information about their practices, articles, and teaching experience.</p>
<p>Local bar presidents and the presiding judges of your general trial court are also good sources to identify a group of practitioners with a speciality in your problem.</p>
<p>Skilled trial lawyers are listed by the American Trial Lawyers Association in its membership list. The section on sustaining members contains prominent trial lawyers 
who can also be a good source for referrals to specialists. Skilled lawyers know the &quot;right&quot; lawyers in their community with special skills. Call your State or local 
Trial Lawyers organization or Consumer Attorneys Association for referrals.</p>
<p>The National Board of Trial Advocates in Boston [617.720.2032] can refer you to a certified civil trial advocate in your location and the National Association of 
Consumer Advocates [617.723.1239] is another good referral source.</p>
<p>Once you start developing a list, call and ask for an appointment concerning a &quot;new matter.&quot; Expect to be screen by a member of the attorneys staff. This is 
common. It is extremely helpful to prepare a one page typed summary of the relevant information concerning your case. Offer to fax it to the paralegal assistant 
screening your call and at the same time ask to be mailed a copy of the law firm's brochure describing its services and the lawyer's professional resume.</p>
<h4>Important Information to Provide Prospective Lawyers </h4>
<p>Provide prospective lawyers with copies of your complaint letters. If you have not done that type up a brief report of the events involving your case, make it one or 
two pages long, so that when you meet with the lawyer there is something for him/her to review. Your one page summary should provide the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your First Name </li>
<li>Your Last Name </li>
<li>Number Street </li>
<li>Apt. </li>
<li>City, State Zipcode </li>
<li>e.mail </li>
<li>day phone </li>
<li>night phone </li>
<li>fax </li>
</ul>
<p>Many times lawyers are contacted by someone other than the person in need of help, such as a parent on behalf of a child, or wife on behalf of a husband. Provide 
the following information on behalf of person who needs assistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The following information is for [describe relationship] </li>
<li>First Name </li>
<li>Last Name </li>
<li>Age </li>
<li>Occupation </li>
<li>For how long? </li>
<li>Current or last employer </li>
<li>City and state where last employed </li>
<li>Highest grade completed </li>
<li>Schools/College attended </li>
<li>Degrees </li>
<li>Year degree granted </li>
<li>Special training or experience in: </li>
</ul>
<p>Describe in 25 words or less why you need a lawyer. The following are examples from actual cases.</p>
<p>Consumer fraud examples ABC Company is defrauding consumers who buy its lightbulbs; my contact lens company sells three different lenses which can be worn 
for different periods at different prices, but they are all the same product.</p>
<p>Small business examples: I have a franchise with XYZ Corporation and other franchisees are getting preferential treatment; RST Company took a down payment 
for a franchise and never returned my money.</p>
<p>Toxic chemical examples: I worked with strong chemicals for years and was just diagnosed with leukemia; the EPA just told us that our home is built on a toxic 
waste disposal site.</p>
<p>Defective product examples: My minivan has been recalled three times and still overheats;</p>
<p>The important point is to provide a brief overview of the type of problem you need resolved.</p>
<p>State the date you were injured or when you first learned that you had been damaged?</p>
<p>How did you learn you were injured? Many times actual knowledge of injury does not occur until well after a wrongful act occurs.</p>
<p>Describe the damage or injury that you have suffered.</p>
<p>Where did it happen?</p>
<p>Who caused the harm?</p>
<p>Full address of wrongdoer</p>
<p>What additional information do you believe the lawyer should have to help you?</p>
<p>What is your goal? Explain here what you hope to achieve by working with a lawyer on this issue.</p>
<p>State if you are interested in serving as a representative in a class action.</p>
<h4>Contingency Fee Contracts</h4>
<p>Search for a lawyer who will take your case on a &quot;contingent fee&quot; basis, where the lawyer is paid a percentage of your recovery if you win and no fee if you lose. 
Also, consumer laws in some states allow for recovery of &quot;reasonable attorney's fees.&quot;</p>
<p>If you have a claim that makes economic sense and one that will provide a lump sum recovery, hire a lawyer who will work on a contingency and who will advance 
costs without recourse. In many states a lawyer can only promise to advance the costs of prosecuting a suit. In California, an attorney can lawfully agree that in the 
event there is no recovery,the client owes nothing for fees or costs, but that is not true under the Rules of Professional Conduct in most states.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that lawyers, like other professionals, have office overhead that must be paid for staff salaries and all the other usual costs of running a business. The 
percentages charged by most lawyers are not set by law and are subject to negotiation. There has been much public discussion about attorneys fees instigated by 
the insurance industry and major manufacturers who are working to deny consumers the right to hire lawyers under a contingency fee or percentage contract. That 
fact alone should confirm what a valuable right Americans have under this type of fee arrangement. Nearly no one else in the U.S. agrees to provide services and 
pay for the cost of a project only if they are successful and the client controls whether or not to give approval to the final result. This is a distinguishing aspect of 
American law and its support of consumers and individuals.</p>
<p>Historically, under a net fee contract case costs would be repaid to the lawyer off the top, and then the net recovery would be be shared 33/66 or 40/60. Because 
of recent court decisions, many lawyers now are offering a fixed percentage to cover both fees and costs, usually 33% to settle before filing suit and 40% after filing. 
These agreements provide the client with a guaranteed percentage in those cases where the expense of preparing a case are high and encourage lawyers to spend 
efficiently. Contingency contracts where the attorney requires a 45% fee off the top and requires the client to reimburse costs out of the client's portion of the 
recovery are an indication that the case may have more negatives than positives.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, always have a written fee agreement and do not sign it unless it is in clear English that you can understand.</p>
<p>This is all the more important when you are hiring a lawyer on an hourly or fixed fee basis. Reputable lawyers prepare an agreement that spells out what he/she is to 
do and what your obligations are as well. Do not sign it unless you understand it and it contains terms that you consider fair.</p>
<p>In evaluating lawyers, only hire a lawyer who agrees to &quot;work&quot; with you. Do not expect the lawyer to initiate contacts with you. Playing telephone tag is for 
amateurs. Real lawyers are extremely busy and they do not sit by the telephone to take calls. The type of lawyer you will want will be spending time in court, in 
depositions, meetings with other lawyers and clients, traveling a good deal, and responding to motions set by my opponents. To keep open communication with 
your lawyer, set meetings in the office or by telephone with the attorney's assistant. Understand that most active lawyers do not control their calendar and your 
conference may be continued from time to time. Be flexible and ready to reschedule. The key is to regularly meet, make sure your case has not fallen through the 
cracks, that you are confident all the work is getting done, and that you understand what is developing.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you cannot locate an attorney to take your case on a contingency basis, you might try paying an attorney for one hour for a consultation to discuss the 
potential merits of your case. If your case really has no merit (and many of do not), you are better off not dwelling on the subject because the focus of your 
frustration will shift from the wrongdoer to the attorney who told you you did not have a case.</p>
<h4>Free Consultations are Available </h4>
<p>Many lawyers offer initial consultations, typically for half an hour, either for free or for a small fee. Such a consultation does not commit you to using the lawyer or 
taking your case to court. During that consultation, you should ask the lawyer about his or her experience bringing similar cases. You should present the facts of 
your case, and ask for an estimate of your chances of success. You will also need to find out how the lawyer charges and what the expected cost for your case 
would be.</p>
<h4><a name="class">Class Actions are Powerful Tools to Correct Misconduct</a></h4>
<p>Be sure to ask whether your case qualifies as a class action, a powerful legal tool which can be used by one person to remedy wrongs committed against many 
consumers. Class actions provide individuals having claims that are inefficient to prosecute separately to be joined together providing there are common issues 
shared with others and the person filing the action as a class representative is willing to represent the interests of all persons similarly situated.</p>
<p>If you agree to serve as a class representative you will be representing the interests of all members of your class in litigation to recover money damages for the class. 
In short, you will be representing the rights of everyone who has been similarly injured because you have claims which are typical of those of the class, and thus 
involve common issues of law or fact. You are required by law to consider the interests of the class just as you would consider your own interests and you will 
participate actively in the lawsuit, such as by testifying at deposition and trial, and answering written interrogatories, and by keeping generally aware of the status and 
progress of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A class action gives you effective power to force a defendant to deal with everyone fairly. Any resolution of the class claims is subject to court approval and must 
be designed in the best interests of the class as a whole. Your main obligation is to provide your lawyers and the court with all relevant facts of which you are aware.</p>
<p>As a class representative you volunteer to represent many other people with similar claims and damages, because you believe that it is important that everyone 
benefits from this lawsuit equally, that a class lawsuit will save time, money, and effort, and thus will benefit all parties, and the court, and that the class action is an 
important tool to assure compliance with the law and honest practices.</p>

to put a stop to consumer abuse by a local wrongdoer. In other

the power of a consumer class action can correct misdeeds. </font></p>

<p>[The authors trace the history of arrest record expungement in California stressing the controlling case of Sterling v. Oakland. 
They conclude that the controlling case law as well as the applicable state constitutional provisions and statutes in some case 
are too vague and uncertain to be applied effectively. They point out that if the constitutional right of privacy is to be 
protected, the courts must put more emphasis on an individual's privacy and scrutinize more closely the need of agencies to 
maintain these arrest records.] </p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>A question of growing importance in today's world of expanding computerization is the extent to which an individual who has 
been arrested, but later exonerated <sup>[1]</sup>, should continue to be affected by the existence of arrest records. In the absence of 
governing statutes<sup> [2]</sup> many courts adopt the position that they have the power to order-expungement of arrest records or to 
provide other more limited forms of relief. In this respect the problem is viewed as one of balancing two conflicting 
considerations: 1) the necessity for law enforcement agencies to maintain adequate identification records so that they may 
efficiently perform their statutory duties; and 2) the potentially disastrous effect the existence of such records might have on the 
individual. While some courts take the position that the judiciary totally lacks the power to order expungement of arrest 
records<sup> [3]</sup>, others view retention of such records as involving an infringement of the fundamental right to privacy. As a 
consequence those courts require the state to justify its action by establishing a compelling state interest.<sup>[4]</sup> The leading 
California case of Sterling v. Oakland <sup>[5]</sup> avoided the question of when circumstances might warrant the expungement of arrest 
records by holding that the determination was more properly one for the legislature. </p>
<p>This article will investigate the present California position with respect to expunging arrest records of adults not convicted of 
the charges for which they were arrested. Current trends in other jurisdictions will be examined to discern any changes in the 
climate for judicial decision which might influence the California Supreme Court to overrule Sterling. </p>
<p><strong>I. Sterling v. Oakland </strong></p>
<p>The controlling case in California on the issue of expungement of arrest records is the Court of appeal decision of Sterling v. 
Oakland.<sup>[6]</sup> Sterling involved a citizen's arrest made by a taxicab driver in a dispute with his passenger over payment of the 
fare. The misdemeanor charges were eventually dismissed, and Ms. Sterling was later vindicated in a civil action against the 
driver and the cab company for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.<sup>[7]</sup> She then brought suit to enjoin the city and 
its police department from retaining her fingerprints and photographs. </p>
<p>The Court of appeal held that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action, affirming the lower court's decision.<sup>[8]</sup> Although 
Sterling is regularly cited for the proposition that the exonerated arrestee cannot seek expungement of arrest records in the 
absence of any legislative mandate, a full reading of Sterling reveals that the Court believed that this was not an area in which it 
was desirable for the court to exercise its power: We base our decision chiefly upon the omission of the Legislature of this 
state to prescribe any duty to return photographs or fingerprints, and upon certain statutory relief which does exist in this state; 
but we find some support for the judgment in the decisions of other states.<sup>[9]</sup> </p>
<p>Thus Sterling does not deny that California courts have the equitable power to remedy manifest injustices caused by retention 
of arrest records. </p>
<p>In reaching its decision that there was no duty to return the photographs or fingerprints of an exonerated arrestee, the court 
relied on four major grounds: 1) the omission of the legislature to provide for the return or expungement of arrest records; 2) 
the sufficiency of existing statutes to protect an exonerated arrestee by insuring that the eventual disposition of the case is 
made part of the arrest records and limiting the access to such reports; 3) the supposition that the existence of an arrest record 
would not adversely affect the arrestee; and 4) the belief that any invasion of the arrestee's right of privacy caused by 
maintaining such records was insignificant. </p>
<p><strong>A. Legislative Omission</strong> </p>
<p>Although the court stated that its decision was based primarily on the &quot;omission&quot; of the legislature to create a duty on the part 
of law enforcement agencies to expunge certain records, it was not actually relying on legislative silence. The previous year a 
bill had been considered by the California legislature which would have required the return of both local and state arrest 
records of all arrestees later exonerated, upon demand and payment of a small fee to defray administrative costs. The court 
looked on failure to enact the bill as an indication that the legislature believed such a remedy was not &quot;necessary or proper or 
expedient.&quot;<sup>[10] </sup></p>
<p><strong>B. Existing Statutes </strong></p>
<p>The court also stressed the sufficiency of protections afforded by California Penal Code section 11116,<sup>[11]</sup> which requires that 
a disposition report be made in those cases in which a criminal complaint or accusation is filed,<sup>[12]</sup> and California Penal Code 
section 11117,<sup>[13]</sup> which requires that such a report be included in the plaintiff's arrest file. Since both the dismissal of the 
charges against Ms. Sterling and the resolution of the private suit in her favor were matters of public record, thus constituting 
the disposition in her official arrest records, the court concluded that she could have no particular interest beyond a &quot;personal 
desire&quot; in return of the arrest records.[14] </p>
<p>While a disposition report is required to contain certain designations and explanations regarding the reasons for a dismissal, it 
is quite apparent from an examination of these designations that improper inferences of guilt may readily be drawn.<sup>[15] </sup>Thus, 
even though such reports are included in an arrest file, they fail to shield an exonerated arrestee from the inference that he is 
really just another criminal who &quot;got off on a technicality.&quot; </p>
<p>California has also enacted certain statutory restrictions on the dissemination of information contained in arrest files.<sup>[16]</sup> Such 
limitations are designed to protect the arrestee from disclosures of information not necessitated by the proper performance of 
official duties, and thus to some extent they afford such information the status of confidentiality. </p>
<p>The range of individuals and agencies which may properly obtain this &quot;confidential&quot; information is extremely broad,<sup>[17]</sup> and the 
ability of police agencies to monitor the use of such information is generally limited to an investigation of whether the stated 
purpose for requesting such information is a statutorily permissible one.<sup>[18]</sup> The result is that arrest records have often fallen 
into unauthorized hands despite the supposed statutory restrictions. </p>
<p>From an examination of the above statutes, it is easily discernible that if an arrestee is adequately insulated from any adverse 
consequences arising from arrest, it is not because of the existence of a disposition report or the statutory limitations on the 
dissemination of such information. Judge Freedman, dissenting in White v. California<sup>[19]</sup> was also unimpressed with the 
sufficiency of these statutes to protect individual liberties: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our nation's current social developments harbor insidious evolutionary forces which propel us toward a 
collective, Orwellian society. One of the features of that society is the utter destruction of privacy, the 
individual's complete exposure to the all-seeing, all-powerful police state. Government agencies, civilian and 
military, federal, state and local, have acquired miles and acres of files, enclosing revelations of the personal 
affairs and conditions of millions of private individuals. Credit agencies and other business enterprises 
assemble similar collections. Information peddlers burrow into the crannies of these collections. Microfilm and 
electronic tape facilitate the storage of private facts on an enormous scale. Computers permit automated 
retrieval, assemblage and dissemination. These vast repositories of personal information may easily be 
assembled into millions of dossiers characteristic of a police state. Our age is one of shriveled privacy. Leaky 
statutes imperfectly guard a small portion of these monumental revelations<sup>.&quot;[20]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>C. Adverse Consequences The Sterling court brushed aside the contention that mere existence of an arrest record could be 
injurious by making it more likely that Ms. Sterling would be arrested sometime in the future and that if she were ever 
convicted of a crime, such records would be considered in sentencing and might result in imposition of a harsher sentence. The 
court concluded that such an argument was specious on the facts presented. Plaintiff had been arrested for a &quot;trivial&quot; 
misdemeanor which had been resolved in her favor and the circumstances which had been the basis for the arrest had also 
been the basis for her recovery of damages.<sup>[21]</sup> </p>
<p>Today the burden of an arrest record cannot be so easily ignored. Courts are increasingly cognizant of the severe 
consequences which may result from mere existence of an arrest record. In 1970 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit stated: </p>
<p>Information denominated a record of arrest, if it becomes known, may subject an individual to serious difficulties. Even if no 
direct economic loss is involved, the injury to an individual's reputation may be substantial. Economic losses themselves may 
be both direct and serious. Opportunities for schooling, employment, or professional licenses may be restricted or nonexistent 
as a consequence of the mere fact of an arrest, even if followed by acquittal or complete exoneration of the charges involved. 
An arrest record may be used by the police in determining whether subsequently to arrest the individual concerned, or 
whether to exercise their discretion to bring formal charges against an individual already arrested<sup>.[22]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>D. Invasion of Privacy</strong> </p>
<p>Sterling was also based at least in part on the court's belief that any invasion of the right of privacy was slight. The court 
argued that the taking of fingerprints had become so commonplace that it should no longer be considered an &quot;indignity,&quot; and 
that in any event, only an expert could decipher fingerprints<sup>.[23]</sup> As for the photographs, which obviously could be easily 
associated with the plaintiff, the court believed that it was for the legislature to determine the permissible extent of their use, 
which would imply that the result might have been different if there had been special facts indicating misuse of the 
photographs.<sup>[24]</sup> The court even argued that retention of records was in plaintiff's interest since the records would enable her 
to prove that she was the person exonerated, a tenuous and unrealistic argument since there was no reason to believe that 
such an issue would ever arise<sup>.[25]</sup> </p>
<p>Sterling was decided in 1962, three years before the landmark United States Supreme Court decision of Griswold v. 
Connecticut<sup>.[26]</sup> In Griswold the Court struck down as violative of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment a 
statute which prohibited the dissemination of birth control information. The Court held that the statute was an impermissible 
invasion of the constitutional right of privacy emanating from the &quot;penumbras&quot; of the first, third, fourth, fifth and ninth 
amendments. The Court further noted that the right of privacy was &quot;older than the Bill of Rights&quot; and as such was a 
fundamental right.<sup>[27]</sup> Later Supreme Court decisions have made it clear that in order to justify an infringement of the 
fundamental right of privacy, the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that a compelling state interest 
be shown<sup>.[28]</sup> </p>
<p>Prior to emergence of the right of privacy as a fundamental right, the majority position was that any invasion of the right of 
privacy was justified by the interest of the state in providing effective law enforcement<sup>.[29]</sup> Griswold heralded a change in this 
attitude toward invasion of privacy and resulted in a growing trend to apply ever more stringent standards in determining 
whether particular infringements should be upheld. </p>
<p>In addition to post-Sterling decisions recognizing the fundamental nature of the right of privacy, an amendment to the 
California constitution was adopted in 1972 which expressly assures Californians the right of privacy.<sup>[30]</sup> This express 
affirmance, together with Supreme Court decisions elevating the importance of the right of privacy, justify a reappraisal of the 
Sterling decision. Sterling dealt with the right of privacy issue in an offhand and ambiguous manner as if it were of minor 
importance. At best, the court applied a balancing test to weigh the particular interests involved on the basis of the facts before 
the court. Arguably, the proper test which should be applied today is the much more stringent compelling interest test<sup>.[31]</sup> In 
any event, it may be helpful to review the approaches of other courts in the post-Griswold era as an aid in anticipating the 
result of any forthcoming California reappraisal. </p>
<p><strong>II. Decisions Following Griswold </strong></p>
<p>There is a split of authority on the issue of whether an exonerated arrestee has the right to have his arrest records expunged or 
returned to him upon request in the absence of a statute granting such a right. The majority view maintains that there is no such 
right.<sup>[32]</sup> </p>
<p>There is wide diversity among the jurisdictions in their approach to the issue of expungement. Some courts take the position 
that they are without power to provide such a remedy<sup>.[33]</sup> Other courts adopt the position that even though they have the 
power, it should not be exercised in the absence of legislative action<sup>.[34] </sup></p>
<p>The better reasoned view, however, is that courts do have the general equitable power to order the expungement of arrest 
records, or other more limited forms of relief, in the appropriate case. The Colorado supreme court so held in Davidson v. 
Dill,<sup>[35]</sup> reversing the lower court's dismissal of a complaint requesting expungement or the return of arrest records for failure 
to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court stated that &quot;courts should be wary of dismissing a case where 
the pleadings show that an alleged violation of a constitutional right is at issue, since fundamental rights and important public 
policy questions are necessarily involved.&quot;<sup>[36]</sup> </p>
<p>Federal courts have also generally adopted this position.<sup>[37]</sup> In Kowall u. United States,<sup>[38]</sup> the district court held that it had 
the inherent power to order records in &quot;the possession and control of federal agencies&quot; to be expunged and therefore denied a 
motion for relief from the trial judge's expungement order. The court did not view the statutes regarding collection of such 
records as affecting its power, at least in the absence of express statutory language, and thus rejected the government's 
assertion that as a matter of law any invasion of an arrestee's right of privacy was outweighed by the state's interest in 
maintaining comprehensive arrest records: </p>
<p>In each case, the court must weigh the reasons advanced for and against expunging arrest records. If it is found after careful 
analysis that the public interest in retaining records of a specific arrest is clearly outweighed by the dangers of unwarranted 
adverse consequences to the individual, then the records involved may be properly expunged.<sup>[39]</sup> </p>
<p>Those courts adopting the position that they do have the power to order expungement of arrest records have generally 
approached the issue on a case-by-case basis, balancing the conflicting interests of law enforcement agencies to maintain such 
records in order to insure efficient performance of their duties against the individual's fundamental right of privacy.<sup>[40] </sup></p>
<p>The fact that the mere existence of arrest records may have disastrous consequences for an innocent arrestee is well 
recognized today.<sup>[41]</sup> Against this consideration must be balanced the argument that efficient law enforcement requires the 
maintenance of complete arrest records. This argument rests upon the supposition that if a person was arrested in the past, 
there is some reason to believe that that arrest was justified, (that is, that the arrestee was engaged in criminal activity, even if 
he was actually never convicted) and that this provides some basis for the inference that he will be involved in criminal conduct 
in the future. Ignoring the question of whether such an inference is permissible in a system of criminal justice which is based on 
the presumption Of innocence, this reasoning contains several obvious fallacies. If someone was arrested solely by mistake, 
there is no basis whatsoever for any inference of possible future criminality.<sup>[42]</sup> Furthermore, there would be no basis for such 
an inference if in fact no arrest had been made, although criminal records of a supposed arrest did exist.<sup>[43]</sup> </p>
<p>The courts have also recognized that there is no permissible basis for an inference of future criminal misconduct in those cases 
involving arrests which violated some constitutional guarantee, such as an illegal mass arrest or an arrest which was part of an 
illegal plan of police harassment.<sup>[44] </sup></p>
<p>An arrest not based on probable cause also presents difficulties, raising serious constitutional issues with respect to the fourth 
amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures<sup>.[45]</sup> In order to safeguard these rights, the Supreme Court 
has adopted an exclusionary rule prohibiting the introduction in state or federal court of evidence obtained in violation of the 
fourth amendment.<sup>[46]</sup> The rationale of adopting such exclusionary evidentiary rules to prevent infringement of fourth 
amendment rights has not been extended to non-evidentiary situations, such as compilation of arrest records, even though such 
actions might involve use of the &quot;fruits of the poisonous tree.&quot;<sup>[47]</sup> At least one court has expressed serious concern about this 
problem: </p>
<p>There is, to say the least, serious question whether the Constitution can tolerate any adverse use of information or tangible 
objects obtained as the result of an unconstitutional arrest of the individual concerned. . . . [I]f appellant can show that his 
arrest was not based on probable cause it is difficult to find constitutional justification for its memorialization in the FBI's 
criminal files.<sup>[48]</sup> </p>
<p>Even if retention of records of an arrest made without probable cause does not offend the fourth amendment, drawing any 
inference of criminality from such an arrest would nevertheless seem tenuous. If at the time of arrest there was no probable 
cause to believe the arrestee had committed a crime, there is clearly no reasonable basis for this inference of criminality, since 
if it is justified at all, it must be justified as of the time the arrest records were made. </p>
<p>In cases in which there is a valid arrest not due to a mistake and in which there is a later exoneration of the arrestee, courts 
have been willing to afford some relief against retention of arrest records where they have been misused. Such misuse has 
been found to exist when photographs of arrestees are displayed in a &quot;rogue's gallery&quot; fashion<sup>.[49]</sup> United States v. Kalish<sup>[50]</sup> 
furnishes another example of misuse of arrest records. Just prior to the time for his induction into the army, defendant was 
arrested for a previous refusal to report for induction. Defendant's refusal was based on the advice of counsel in order to test 
the propriety of the local board's determination of his draft status. A habeas corpus petition had been filed and the Selective 
Service had been ordered to show cause why such petition should not issue. At the hearing to show cause, even though 
Kalish stated the reasons for his prior refusal and stated his then willingness to be inducted, the United States attorney insisted 
that he be arrested. Previously, the U.S. attorney had also agreed that Kalish should be permitted to reopen the selective 
service proceedings before being inducted.<sup>[51]</sup> </p>
<p>The charges against him were subsequently dropped. However, the facts indicated threatened use of the arrest process to 
frustrate a federal constitutional right.<sup>[52]</sup> Under such circumstances, the court held that retention by the FBI and other federal 
agencies of criminal arrest records constituted an unwarranted attack upon his character and violated his right of privacy.<sup>[53]</sup> 
The court ordered the attorney general to destroy all arrest records. </p>
<p>In the above situations a balancing test was employed to determine the relative strength of any inference drawn from an arrest 
which would support the state's contention of the need to retain particular records. In Eddy v. Moore<sup>[54]</sup> the Supreme Court 
of Washington held that retention of arrest records where all charges had been dismissed invaded the arrestee's fundamental 
right of privacy, thus invoking the compelling state interest test: </p>
<p>We believe the right of an individual, absent a compelling showing of necessity by the government, to the return of his 
fingerprints and photographs, upon an acquittal, is a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and that it is as 
well within the penumbras of the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights. . . .<sup>[55]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>III. Remedies</strong> </p>
<p>Although this society prides itself on the philosophy that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, as a practical matter 
that policy is more honored in the breach than in the observance. In our mass media society, an initial allegation of criminality is 
regularly voiced to the world as news and as such is indelibly noted by the public, regardless of the outcome of the charges. 
This reaction is due in part to the high number of criminal cases resulting in termination in favor of the government. </p>
<p>Regardless of the empirical results, neither the presumption of innocence nor the innocent arrestee should suffer, whether 
dismissal comes by way of grace, in the interest of justice, by judicial dismissal on the merits or by acquittal. Respect for the 
presumption of innocence until guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt requires that termination of criminal proceedings 
in favor of the arrestee be coupled with a favorable inference compatible with that presumption. Accordingly, arrest records 
should at that time be automatically expunged by rule of law. </p>
<p>Critics argue that such expungement amounts to rewriting history. They maintain that only when no probable cause for arrest 
can be found in the record should expungement follow. </p>
<p>Present practice requires retention of arrest records, and an order of expungement is the most radical remedy available to a 
court. Judicial reluctance to take this step is no doubt premised on a belief in the value of arrest records. Dealing with that 
reality, sealing of such records under a plan whereby records would only be admitted in a criminal proceeding involving the 
arrestee as a principal would serve to protect the innocent person from the stigma of arrest and yet at the same time would 
also serve some of the desires of prosecutors. </p>
<p>Retaining arrest records obviously enhances the intelligence capability of law enforcers. The major concern of the individual is 
the potentially devastating effect a resurrected arrest record can have on his or her life. One solution adopted by the courts is 
to &#179;neutralize&#178; arrest records. By removal of all notations and other indications of the person behind the record, the individual 
is relieved of the arrest record stigma. In Menard v. Saxbe,<sup>[56]</sup> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
adopted this approach and ordered expungement of criminal arrest records while retaining fingerprints which were kept in a 
civilian, noncriminal file and which did not indicate their true source. </p>
<p>Another remedy available to a court is restriction of the dissemination of arrest records. Generally availability of this remedy 
has not been held to be limited by statute, except to the extent that the court views such statutes as being sufficient to protect 
the interests of the exonerated arrestee.<sup>[57]</sup> As noted above this protection is relatively meaningless since basically there are 
too many potential disseminators to control. </p>
<p>Another suggested remedy is a modified form of expungement premised upon a modified belief in the presumption of 
innocence. Individuals with a single record of arrest would have their records expunged after the passage of several years 
without a subsequent arrest. Under this plan minor offenses would be expunged more quickly than serious charges. The defect 
in this approach is that regardless of the validity of the arrest the innocent individual still bears the burden of a record for some 
time. </p>
<p>Aside from the substance of the relief, unless law enforcement officials are under a mandatory duty to expunge upon the 
dismissal of charges, any relief that is fashioned may well be meaningless to those citizens who are unable to cope effectively 
with government bureaucracy. Limiting the right of expungement to those who can hire lawyers to pursue expungement places 
an unjustifiable burden on the innocent and procedurally denies relief to many people. Requiring mandatory expungement 
would not only solve this problem but in the long run would also generate respect for our legal system by reinforcing the 
validity of the premise that all are innocent until proven guilty. </p>
<p><strong>IV. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>When a balancing test is used to weigh the conflicting interests of law enforcement agencies in retaining arrest files and the 
individual's right of privacy, circumstances such as the misuse of records, an arrest which itself violates a constitutional 
guarantee, or a mistaken arrest have generally resulted in the balance being struck in favor of the individual. In the absence of 
such special circumstances, courts have been hesitant to interfere with the executive discretion to compile such records. 
However, in recent years courts have been more willing to question the propriety of retaining arrest records of exonerated 
arrestees. </p>
<p>This growing trend is primarily a function of two variables: the increasing recognition by the courts of the severe consequences 
that may flow from mere existence of an arrest record, and emergence of the right of privacy as a fundamental right protected 
by the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and the equal Protection clause of the fourteenth 
amendment. Both of these factors are in turn directly related to the increasing use of computerization to pool agency 
information, a development which has caused a &quot;growing concern for the individual's loss of privacy as a natural by-product of 
our modern technology.&quot;<sup>[58]</sup> If &quot;Privacy&quot; is not to become a meaningless word for an innocent arrestee, the courts must be 
willing to scrutinize the need of agencies to maintain such arrest records. Sterling v. Oakland should be recognized as obsolete 
and should be overruled, especially in light of the mandate of California's most recent constitutional amendments. </p>
<p><strong>Endnotes </strong></p>
<p>1.	&quot;Exoneration&quot; as used in this article refers to the release of an arrestee without formal charges being brought, to dismissal of 
charges, or to acquittal of the arrestee after a trial on the merits. The number of arrests ending in exoneration is not 
insignificant. In 1973 there were 1,021,617 arrests of adults in California and, on the basis of past statistics, approximately 
one-half of these arrests will be resolved by release, dismissal, or acquittal of the arrestee. Documentation by the California 
Bureau of Criminal Statistics. </p>
<p>2.	Those states having expungement statutes as of 1966 are listed and discussed in Gough, The Expungement of Adjudication 
Records of Juvenile and Adult Offenders: A Problem of Status, 1966 WASH. U.L.Q. 147, 162-68, 174-78. In addition, 
Illinois has recently enacted such statutes. ILL. REV. STAT. ANN. ch. 38, &#167;206-5 (1970). It should be noted that most 
&quot;expungement&quot; statutes actually provide for the return or sealing of arrest records, rather than for their literal destruction.

<p>11.	California Penal Code section 11116 as amended in 1972 is substantially the same as the earlier version discussed in 
Sterling v. Oakland, 208 Cal. App.. 2d 1, 24 Cal. Rptr. 696 (1962), and in pertinent part provides: </p>
<p>Whenever a criminal complaint or accusation is filed in any superior, municipal or justice court, the clerk, or, if there be no 
clerk, the judge of that court shall furnish a disposition report of such case to the sheriff, police department or other law 
enforcement agency primarily responsible for the investigation of the crime alleged in a form prescribed or approved by the 
Department of Justice. </p>
<p>12.	California Penal Code section 11115; requires that a similar disposition report be made in cases in which the suspect is 
released without a criminal complaint or accusation having been filed and whenever the arrestee is transferred to the custody 
of another agency. In addition, this section provides in part: </p>
<p>If either of the following dispositions is made, the disposition report shall so state: </p>
<p>(a) &quot;Arrested for intoxication and released,&quot; when the arrested party is released pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of 
Section 849. </p>
<p>(b) &quot;Detention only,&quot; when the detained party is released pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 849. In such 
cases the report shall state the specific reason for such release, indicating that there was no ground for making a criminal 
complaint because (1) further investigation exonerated the arrested party, (2) the complainant withdrew the complaint, (3) 
further investigation appeared necessary before prosecution could be initiated, (4) the ascertainable evidence was insufficient 
to proceed further, (5) the admissible or adducible evidence was insufficient to proceed further, or (6) other appropriate 
explanation for release. </p>
<p>13.	California Penal Code section 11117 was also amended in 1972, but remains substantially unchanged. It requires the 
Department of Justice to place disposition reports required under California Penal Code sections 11115-16 in the 
&quot;appropriate criminal records.&quot; </p>
<p>14.	Sterling v. Oakland, 208 Cal. App. 1, 7, 24 Cal. Rptr. 696, 700 (1962). </p>
<p>15.	California Penal Code section 11116 governs those cases in which a criminal complaint was filed and requires that a 
disposition report contain one or more of the following labels: </p>
<p>(a) &quot;Dismissal in furtherance of justice, pursuant to Section 1385 of the Penal Code.&quot; In addition to this disposition label, the 
court shall set forth the particular reasons for the dismissal as stated in its order entered upon the minutes. </p>
<p>(b) &quot;Case compromised; defendant discharged because restitution or other satisfaction was made to the injured person, 
pursuant to Sections 1377 and 1378 of the Penal Code.&quot; </p>
<p>(c) &quot;Court found insufficient cause to believe defendant guilty of a public offense; defendant discharged without trial pursuant 
to Section 871 of the Penal Code.&quot; </p>
<p>(d) &quot;Dismissal due to delay; action against defendant dismissed because the information was not filed or the action was not 
brought to trial within the time allowed by Section 1381, 1381.5, or 1382 of the Penal Code.&quot; </p>
<p>(e) &quot;Accusation set aside pursuant to Section 995 of the Penal Code.&quot; In addition to this disposition label, the court shall set 
forth the particular reasons for the disposition. </p>
<p>(f) &quot;Defective accusation; defendant discharged pursuant to Section 1008 of the Penal Code,&quot; when the action is dismissed 
pursuant to that section after demurrer is sustained, because no amendment of the accusatory pleading is permitted or 
amendment is not made or filed within the time allowed. </p>
<p>(g) &quot;Defendant became a witness for the people and was discharged pursuant to Section 1099 of the Penal Code.&quot; </p>
<p>(h) &quot;Defendant discharged at trial because of insufficient evidence, in order to become a witness for his codefendant pursuant 
to Section 1100 of the Penal Code.&quot; </p>
<p>(i) &quot;Proceedings suspended; defendant found presently insane and committed to state hospital pursuant to Sections 1367 to 
1372 of the Penal Code.&quot; If defendant later becomes sane and is legally discharged pursuant to Section 1372, his disposition 
report shall so state. </p>
<p>(j) &quot;Convicted of (state offense).&quot; The disposition report shall state whether defendant was convicted on plea of guilty, on plea 
of nolo contendere, by jury verdict, or by court finding and shall specify the sentence imposed, including probation granted, 
suspension of sentence, imposition of sentence withheld, or fine imposed and if fine was paid. </p>
<p>(k) &quot;Acquitted of (state offense),&quot; when general &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict or finding is rendered. </p>
<p>(1) &quot;Not guilty by reason of insanity,&quot; when verdict or finding is that defendant was insane at the time the offense was 
committed. </p>
<p>(m) &quot;Acquitted; proof at trial did not match accusation,&quot; when defendant is acquitted by reason of variance between charge 
and proof pursuant to Section 1151. </p>
<p>(n) &quot;Acquitted; previously in jeopardy,&quot; when defendant is acquitted on a plea of former conviction or acquittal or once in 
jeopardy pursuant to Section 1151. </p>
<p>(o) &quot;Judgment arrested; defendant discharged,&quot; when the court finds defects in the accusatory pleading pursuant to Sections 
1185 to 1187, and defendant is released pursuant to Section 1188. </p>
<p>(p) &quot;Judgment arrested; defendant recommitted,&quot; when the court finds defects in the accusatory pleading pursuant to Sections 
1185 to 1187, and defendant is recommitted to answer a new indictment of information pursuant to Section 1188. </p>
<p>(q) &quot;Mistrial; defendant discharged.&quot; In addition to this disposition level, the court shall set forth the particular reasons for its 
declaration of a mistrial. </p>
<p>(r) &quot;Mistrial; defendant recommitted.&quot; In addition to this disposition label, the court shall set forth the particular reasons for its 
declaration of a mistrial. </p>
<p>(s) Any other disposition by which the case was terminated. In addition to the disposition label, the court shall set forth the 
particular reasons for the disposition. </p>

<p>All people are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and

privacy. </p>
<p>The booklet on the proposed amendments to the California constitution which accompanied voter packets in 1972 stated: </p>
<p>The proliferation of government snooping and data collecting is threatening to destroy our traditional freedoms. Government 
agencies seem to be competing to compile the most extensive sets of dossiers of American citizens. Computerization of 
records makes it possible to create &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; profiles on every American. </p>
<p>At present there are no effective restraints on the information activities of government and business. This amendment creates a 
legal and enforceable right of privacy for every Californian (emphasis in original). </p>

<p>33.	See, e.g., Spock v. District of Columbia, 283 A. 2d 14 (D.C. Ct. App. 1971) which held that the District of Columbia 
courts were without the power to order expungement, but remanded for the lower court to determine whether some lesser 
form of relief should be awarded. But see Menard v. Mitchell, 430 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1970), distinguished in Spock as 
dealing with the expungement of F.B.I. records, rather than the local police records authorized to be compiled by local statute. 
Compare Morrow v. District of Columbia, 417 F.2d 728 (D.C. Cir 1969), which held that the lower court had ancillary 
jurisdiction to issue an order regarding arrest records in a criminal case which had been heard before it. On remand in In re 
Alexander, 259 A.2d 592 (D.C. Ct. App. 1969), the lower court held that the local statutes limiting dissemination of arrest 
records provided sufficient protection of the arrestee's rights and that &quot;no further order is required . . . except in rare cases 
presenting such unusual facts as to justify the trial court in ordering a particular arrest record completely expunged.&quot; Id. at 593. </p>

(D.C. Ct. App. 1971). One court, after denying the existence of any expungement remedy, took the position that in order to 
obtain some lesser form of relief based on a mistaken arrest, it was necessary for plaintiff to make an affirmative showing of 
nonculpability. Spock v. District of Columbia, 283 A.2d 14,19 (D.C. Ct. App. 1971). However, this decision was based in 
large part on the court's determination that the existing statutes afforded adequate protection. See In re Alexander, 259 A.2d 
592, 593 (D.C. Ct. App. 1969). </p>
<p>43.	In Menard v. Saxbe, 498 F.2d 1017 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that an 
asserted arrest was merely a detention under California Penal Code section 849b(1) and that although the F.B.I. was 
authorized by federal statute to collect and maintain arrest records pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 534, this statute did not 
authorize the F.B.I. to maintain criminal records of mere encounters. The court noted that it was not prohibiting the collection 
of neutral identification records, but merely retention of such records in criminal files. </p>
<p>44.	See, e.g., Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (injunction against dissemination of mass arrest records

<p>55.	Id. at 345, 487 P.2d at 217 and Annot., 46 A.L.R. 3d 889, 898. The Washington court held that state statutes providing 
for the confidentiality of such arrest records were insufficient to protect the exonerated arrestee's right of privacy. These 
statutes were repealed in 1970, but were similar to present California statutes. For example, the Revised Code of Washington 
section 72.50.140 provided that upon dismissal or acquittal all such records would be considered confidential and limited by 
sections 72.50.100 and 72.50.080 to the official use of law enforcement agencies and other authorized persons, except upon 
court order or the notarized request of the arrestee. In effect California Penal Code section 11105 also attempts to make 
arrest records confidential, although it does not distinguish between arrests ending in acquittal or conviction. </p>

<p>57.	See, e.g., In re Alexander, 259 A. 2d 592 (D.C. Ct. App. 1969) which held that in the absence of unusual facts, the 
statutory limitations on the distribution of arrest reports in those cases in which there was no conviction or forfeiture of 
collateral to law enforcement agents were sufficient. See also Comment, Retention and Dissemination of Arrest Records:

<h2>Survivors of Sexual Assault: </h2>
<h3>A General Information Guide for Women, Their Families and Counselors </h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Editor </h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Published in 1978 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Special Announcement</strong></p>
<p>This book was first published in 1978 as special project of the Santa Clara County Bar Association and the Santa Clara 
County Criminal Justice Advisory Board. At the time I served as the chair of the county justice advisory board and was a 
Trustee of the Santa Clara County Bar Association. A committee was formed to produce a brochure for women who had 
been assaulted, but like many such efforts the tasks fell on the committee chair and over a period of six months I compiled the 
information that became this book. I claim no authorship, but merely borrowed, re-wrote and brought together the work of 
those acknowledged below into one document so it could be a ready reference, adding my own perspective and experience 
throughout. As part of a special project at San Jose State University, 15,000 copies of the book were printed and circulated. 
It was well used for many years as a training manual for rape counselors. </p>
<p>The information contained here has not been updated. I leave that task to others. This book should only be used as a general 
guide and it obviously is not legal advice, that can only come from a lawyer in your state who knows the law and the facts of 
your case. </p>
<p>This book now is offered on the internet as a general guide for anyone to use to develop a resource manual for survivors of 
sexual assault in their community, rather than simply gather dust on my library shelf. I hope someone can and will use this 
material to benefit others. That was my original intention when I compiled this information. This book may be copied and used 
by any non-profit organization with my permission, and best wishes, just please send an email to access@alexanderlaw.com 
notifying me that the material is being put to good use or write me at P. O. Box 1330, San Jose, CA 95109-1330. </p>
<p>Originally this book was titled &quot;Rape Crisis: The Victim's Right.&quot; I have changed the title in this re-publishing to focus not on 
&quot;victimization,&quot; which as a concept empowers criminals, rapists and abusers, and instead have chosen to place the emphasis 
where it properly belongs: on surviving, overcoming and living. To those who struggle to do that and to those who love and 
care for them, I respectfully dedicate this re-publication. </p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Rape is a crime of violence carried out through sexual means. One out of ten women can expect to be assaulted during her 
lifetime. Any woman can be raped - regardless of race, age or occupation - anywhere, anytime. Although men are sexually 
assaulted too, by other men, the primary targets are women. </p>
<p>The Santa Clara County Bar Association prepared this booklet as a public service to women in Santa Clara County. The 
booklet's focus is not on rape prevention, but on the Survivor's personal experience, and on her involvement with agencies 
such as police, hospitals, district attorneys' offices, courts and mental health facilities. </p>
<p>Why is this important? </p>
<p>Because rape is traumatic and knowledge of the Survivor's needs, her rights, where to go for help and what she can expect to 
feel will help her survive the trauma. </p>
<p>The chapters of the book represent the steps in the legal/medical process which follow a rape. </p>
<p>Chapter I describes the law, some of the myths surrounding rape, and precautionary measures. </p>
<p>Chapter II describes the emotional aftermath of rape for both women and men, and discusses mental health services. </p>
<p>Chapter III describes police procedures. </p>
<p>Chapter IV discusses emergency room procedures and medical after care. </p>
<p>Chapter V describes the district attorney's role and municipal court procedures. </p>
<p>Chapter VI describes superior court procedures. </p>
<p>Chapter VII discusses compensation for the rape Survivor. </p>
<p>Chapter VIII is a referrals section, listing medical facilities, mental health counseling, police departments, temporary 
emergency housing, legal information, and support networks in Santa Clara County, as well as out of county services. </p>
<p>Chapter IX is a bibliography of booklets and articles dealing with rape. </p>
<p>Every effort has been made to include as wide a range of services as possible. However, no list can be complete. There may 
be other services available in your community. </p>

<p><strong>The Law </strong></p>
<p>Before deciding whether or not to press charges, the survivor of rape should be familiar with the applicable law. </p>
<p>The California Penal Code section 261 defines the crime of rape as an act of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a person 
not the spouse of the perpetrator, under any of the following circumstances: </p>
<ol>
<li>Where a person is incapable, through lunacy or other unsoundness of mind, whether temporary or </li>
<li>permanent, of giving legal consent. </li>
<li>Where it is accomplished against a person's will by means of force or fear of immediate and unlawful </li>
<li>bodily injury on the person or another. </li>
<li>Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating, narcotic or anesthetic substance, </li>
<li>administered by or with the privity of the accused. </li>
<li>Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act, and this is known to the accused. </li>
<li>Where a person submits under the belief that the person committing the act is the Survivor's spouse, and </li>
<li>this belief is induced by any artifice, pretense, or concealment practiced by the accused, with intent to induce such </li>
<li>belief. </li>
</ol>
<p>Section 261.5: Commonly known as statutory rape, this is any sexual intercourse with a female &quot;not the wife of the 
perpetrator&quot; where the female is under 18. </p>
<p>Section 262: &quot;Rape of a person who is the spouse of a perpetrator is an act of sexual intercourse&quot; accomplished against the 
will of the spouse by means of force or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the spouse or another. </p>
<p>There is no arrest or prosecution under this section unless the violation is reported to a peace officer or to the county district 
attorney within 30 days of the violation. </p>
<p>Section 263: &quot;The essential guilt of rape consists in the outrage to the person and feelings of the Survivor of the rape. Any 
sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.&quot; </p>
<p>Section 264: The punishment for rape as defined in section 261 is three, six or eight years in the state prison. As defined in 
section 262, rape is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or in state prison for three, six 
or eight years. If the defendant committed rape and also inflicted great bodily injury on the Survivor, the punishment is 15 
years to life imprisonment in the state prison. </p>
<p>Section 1203.065: This major piece of legislation passed in 1979, makes certain sexual offenders ineligible for probation: 11 
probation shall not be granted to any person convicted of violation of subdivision (2) (3) of- section 261, or section 264.1 or 
committing sodomy or oral copulation in violation of section 286 or 288a by force, violence, duress, menace or threat of great 
bodily harm.&quot; </p>
<p>If convicted, the sexual offender would not remain in the community, but would instead be sent to state prison or to an 
appropriate state level facility. </p>
<p>There are several limitations inherent in the rape laws. First, the State of California must prove &quot;lack of consent,&quot; which is 
difficult if the Survivor has had previous sexual relations with the suspect. Second, rape historically has been viewed as 
requiring &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; or &quot;penetration.&quot; Because the law defines rape in terms of sexual intercourse, it tends to view 
rape as a purely sexual crime, rather than the violently aggressive physical crime that it is. Third, according to court decisions, 
&quot;great bodily injury&quot; means substantial or significant physical injury in addition to that already present in every rape case. 
Although courts agree that sexually abusive conduct constitutes a serious crime and that Survivors experience substantial 
psychological and emotional distress, &quot;great bodily injury&quot; does not include the Survivor's emotional trauma. (People v. 
Caudillo (1978) 146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274, 21 C. 3d 562.) </p>
<p>People often refer erroneously to other sex crimes such as sodomy, or oral copulation as rape. These are separate crimes and 
are covered by separate sections of the Penal Code. Even if one is a Survivor of a sex crime other than rape, the facts and 
services in the book are relevant. </p>
<p><strong>Myths</strong> </p>
<p>There are many myths about the crime of rape, which affect the way the Survivor views herself and is treated by society. It is, 
perhaps, the only crime of violence for which the Survivor feels responsibility and guilt. </p>
<p>One lingering myth, is that rape is a sexual crime, which the Survivor asked for and secretly enjoyed. This is nonsense! No 
matter what circumstances led up to the attack and subsequent rape, no one ever &quot;asks&quot; to be raped, or to suffer the 
accompanying degradation and long term emotional effects. Further, profiles of convicted -rapists show that the perpetrator 
usually experiences no enjoyment of the sex act, but only rapes as an expression of violence to degrade the Survivor. </p>
<p>Another myth is that the Survivor should never fight against her attacker. Every rape is different. Fighting can be appropriate 
or foolish. Submission may be the best course when the rapist is armed with a weapon. However, the Survivor's best defense 
is to maintain control of the situation, because the rapist, whether a sick or angry person, usually wants to overpower the 
Survivor both physically and psychologically. </p>
<p>The Survivor may try to catch the rapist of off guard, by reacting differently from the rapist's expectations. She should use her 
imagination. Unless she is fighting for her life, she may go along with the assault until she can see a chance to safely react. The 
Survivor should go along attitudinally, not sexually. Whatever she does, if it does not help her, she should make sure it does 
not harm her. </p>
<p>By thinking creatively at the time of the attack, the Survivor might extricate herself from the situation and contribute to the 
rapist's arrest and conviction. </p>
<p>Weapons, such as a nail file, rat-tail combs, or tear gas, are often ineffective for the simple reason that they are usually in a 
purse or bag and not immediately available. The best defense against assault is the study and continued practice of physical 
defense. The time and money spent is well worth the effort. </p>
<p>Society's attitudes about rape do seem to be changing. The police, hospitals, attorneys, and courts are generally more 
sensitive to rape Survivors than in years past. For instance, today the past sexual history of the Survivor is not normally 
admissible in evidence during a rape trial. </p>
<p><strong>Precautionary Measures </strong></p>
<p>A woman should not have to fear for her body and life every time she goes somewhere alone. Realistically, however, women 
can and should protect themselves from rape by adopting some of the following suggestions. </p>
<p>The greatest precaution is simply the use of common sense. </p>
<p><strong>At Home</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure hallways, garages and grounds are lighted. </li>
<li>Have key ready to open door. </li>
<li>Leave a spare key with a friend rather than leaving it under the doormat or over the door. </li>
<li>Lock windows and doors that are easily accessible. Pull shades or curtains after dark so as not to advertise that no one 
else is home. </li>
<li>List only last name and initials on mailbox, door and phonebook. </li>
<li>Do not give out personal information or make appointments with strangers over the phone. </li>
<li>Check who is at the door before answering it. Make sure repair and salesprsons, police and survey-takers have 
identification. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Town</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid isolated places at night. Try not to travel alone; at least, tell someone of the intended destination. </li>
<li>Use well-lighted paths at night. Make use of public transportation instead of walking long distances alone in the dark. 
Wait at well-lighted stops where there are other persons, if possible. </li>
<li>Take bike lights always when biking at night. </li>
<li>Yell &quot;Fire&quot; rather than &quot;Rape&quot; or &quot;Help&quot; for faster results. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the Car</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Park in well-lighted areas. </li>
<li>Walk back to car with key ready. </li>
<li>Check back seat before getting in to make sure no one is hiding. </li>
<li>Keep doors locked at all times. </li>
<li>If the car breaks down: raise the hood, put on the emergency lights and lock the doors. Wait for someone to stop and 
offer help. Stay in the car and ask them to call the police or a garage. </li>
<li>Avoid hitchhiking and hitchhikers. Get a ride from women and older couples if hitchhiking is a must. if there is more 
than one man in the car, do not get inside. Always look at the license number of the car and jot it down. Ask first where 
the driver is going and keep baggage in the car. Above all, if the driver and passengers do not look trustworthy, refuse 
the ride. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="emotional"><strong>Chapter II</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>The Emotional Reaction to Rape </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emotional Aftermath of Rape </strong></p>
<p>Rape traumatizes both the Survivor and her husband or partner. Rape fosters physical and emotional reactions in all Survivors 
which continue long after the immediate danger has passed. All rape Survivors share certain feelings about themselves and 
those around them, but the degree to which an individual experiences the emotional reaction varies. A Survivor can take steps 
to lessen the effect and shorten her recovery. Recovery comes from regaining control over her life and from receiving support 
and understanding from family and friends. </p>
<p>Rape Survivors not only experience difficulties in sleeping but have nightmares and feelings of rage, of shame and of loss. 
Many Survivors experience fears of being alone and of being around men, and have difficulty with present and future sexual 
relationships. Often, family, close friends and lovers are not able to deal with the rape, which directly affects the Survivor. 
Usually rape Survivors resolve their feelings in six to eight weeks, in either a positive or a negative manner. The Survivor can 
make a positive resolution by communicating with people who understand the nature of the problem, who care about her, and 
who want to assist her in her resolution. </p>
<p><strong>Professional Counselors Are Available To The Rape Survivor </strong></p>
<p>Today, the emotional and physical reactions of Survivors of the violent crime are better understood than a few years ago. The 
rape Survivor has unique crisis symptoms which respond best to early crisis intervention techniques. </p>
<p>It is imperative that Survivors immediately use the available community mental health counseling, advocacy and family/friend 
support. </p>
<p>The crisis intervention counselor's goal is to help the Survivor focus on the help she needs, her future decisions, how to protect 
herself, and how to take positive control over her life. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Assault Survivor--Counselor Privilege </strong></p>
<p>A Survivor of sexual assault, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from 
disclosing a confidential communication between the Survivor and a sexual assault Survivor counselor. Evidence Code Section 
1035, et seq. A &quot;confidential communication&quot; means information transmitted between the counselor and the Survivor 
necessary in providing counseling, including the Survivor's prior or subsequent sexual conduct, the Survivor's opinions 
regarding sexual conduct and the Survivor's reputation in sexual matters. Advice given by the counselor on potential court 
testimony is not protected. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>
<p>In addition to seeking medical help after rape, the Survivor should be aware of: </p>
<ul>
<li>The availability of professional counselors. </li>
<li>The value of supportive friends and family, who can help her cope positively with the rape experience. </li>
<li>The benefits of rest, regular meals, exercise and maintaining as normal a daily routine as possible. </li>
<li>The &quot;rape crisis syndrome,&quot; (the situational crisis experienced by the Survivor and the important people in her life -- 
family, husband, lover). Studies have shown that immediate crisis counseling will help resolve this situation positively in 
the least possible amount of time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Rape Crisis Syndrome</strong> </p>
<p>Although some Survivors do not experience this syndrome, an awareness of its symptoms may help to guide those who do. </p>
<p>The stages of rape crisis syndrome are: Primary Crisis Stage (the rape experience through the following 24 hours). The most 
common physical reactions are: o coldness, clamminess, numbness (shock); </p>
<ul>
<li>shaking, cold sweats, nausea, over-reaction to noises; </li>
<li>loss of appetite; </li>
<li>change in facial expression; </li>
<li>sleeplessness, nightmares; </li>
<li>loss of normal energy level; </li>
<li>sudden crying jags, or the inability to cry at all; </li>
<li>confusion about time, loss of immediate memory recall. </li>
</ul>
<p>The most common emotional reactions are: </p>
<ul>
<li>a sense of loss, violation; </li>
<li>feelings of loss of control over life, helplessness, shame or humiliation (many rapists want Survivors to feel this), 
alternating anger and sadness; </li>
<li>fears of dying, darkness, of being alone or isolated, of the rapist returning, of falling asleep; </li>
<li>unusual impatience, inability to handle normal routines, and changes of personality in handling relationships. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note:	The emotional reactions appear to be most acute with Survivors who did not know their assailant, or the reason for his 
attack. Many Survivors who did not see or cannot identify the rapist experience an unfocused fear of all unknown persons and 
noises--probably because they could not &quot;identify&quot; their assailant. However, rapists are not always &quot;strangers&quot;; they are often 
acquaintances, friends, neighbors or relatives. </p>
<p><strong>Secondary Crisis Stage (second day through sixth week) </strong></p>
<p>The most common secondary reactions are: </p>
<ul>
<li>continued difficulty in sleeping; </li>
<li>continued loss of normal energy levels; </li>
<li>continued loss of appetite; </li>
<li>feelings of intense anger and rage, or of being &quot;overwhelmed&quot;; </li>
<li>depression (sadness, helplessness, grief); </li>
<li>difficulties with intimate relationships; </li>
<li>withdrawal from sexual activity; </li>
<li>change in feelings about physical appearance; </li>
<li>continued difficulty in coping with normal routine; </li>
<li>continued impatience and inappropriate displays of anger; </li>
<li>excessive and persistent fear of something associated with the rape (knives, cars, death, people following behind, men, 
etc.). </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The inability to reason her way out of these reactions and feelings can be frightening. The professional counselor has 
techniques to help the Survivor work her way through this crisis experience. </p>
<p><strong>Third Stage (post-crisis adjustment, sixth week on)</strong> </p>
<p>Some reactions may remain, but if the Survivor has had help, the rape will no longer be the only thing on her mind. The rape 
no longer dominates her life, and she will begin to feel more like her &quot;old self.&quot; If her crisis continues past eight weeks, then she 
may need more intensive help. </p>
<p><strong>Emotional Needs Of The Survivor During Court Procedures </strong></p>
<p>Questioning, identification and testifying can emotionally drain the Survivor. Many Survivors find it difficult to see the rapist 
again, to recount their story many times, and to relive the experience through testimony. </p>
<p>Many police agencies assign a female officer trained in sex crime investigation to interview the Survivor. The district attorney's 
off ice has deputies trained to deal with rape cases and Survivors. </p>
<p>If a Survivor needs additional support, advocacy services are available. The service may include counselors who give 
Survivors emotional support during interviews at the district attorney's office and during court appearances. </p>
<p>Supportive friends and family can help during this time. The Survivor should not be afraid to ask for support. </p>
<p>Finally, many women feel depression, anger and fear if the rapist is not found guilty. For some women the decision to report 
the rape, assist the police, and participate in the trial seems to help in dealing with such feelings. </p>
<p><strong>Emotional Needs Of The Survivor's Male &quot;Significant Other&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Although a great deal is known about the trauma of the rape Survivor, along with ways to help her cope with her crisis, it 
seems little is known about the effects of rape on the Survivor's male &quot;significant other&quot; - husband, boyfriend, brother or 
father. </p>
<p>By describing the impact upon men, it is hoped the issue of rape will be regarded as a joint concern of both women and men, 
as well as a community and societal problem. </p>
<p>Studies dealing with the male's ability to deal with rape and its consequences theorize that the affected male, like the assaulted 
female, undergoes his own rape trauma.&quot; Because his trauma is obviously less severe than the female's, it is often overlooked 
or suppressed in the rush to aid and comfort the rape Survivor. </p>
<p>However, it is important to recognize the male rape trauma syndrome and, if necessary, provide appropriate individual or 
&quot;couple&quot; counseling. The rapidity with which the female rape Survivor recovers from her attack largely depends upon the level 
of emotional support she receives from family and friends. If her male partner cannot handle her crisis, then the situation 
worsens. </p>
<p>Common symptoms of male rape trauma include guilt, rage and resentment. The degree to which a male partner suffers rape 
trauma, and his capacity to provide the Survivor with emotional support, turns on his definition of rape. For instance, whether 
a man regards rape as a crime of sex, a Survivor-precipitated crime, or a violation of property rights has a direct bearing on 
his ability to accept its consequences. </p>
<p>In the event his wife or girlfriend has been raped, the man should recognize that he has different, often conflicting feelings 
which he must acknowledge to her. Even if he feels totally frustrated and helpless, and incapable of dealing with the situation, 
he can at least admit that fact -- along with declaring his love and support. That attitude will help to ease the immediate crisis. </p>

<p><strong>The Report </strong></p>
<p><strong>How The Survivor Can Help: Preserve The Evidence </strong></p>
<p>If the Survivor decides to report the crime, she should do so immediately. The sooner the Survivor reports a crime, the more 
likely the rapist will be arrested and prosecution will be successful. In addition and perhaps more importantly, an immediate 
report is often considered corroboration of the complaint's validity. </p>
<p>While waiting for the police to arrive, it is essential that the Survivor: </p>
<ul>
<li>Does not douche; </li>
<li>Does not wash her hands, face, or any part of her body; </li>
<li>Does not change her clothes; </li>
<li>Does not clean or straighten her house or any other area if it was the scene of the assault; </li>
<li>Does not touch fingerprints the rapist may have left. </li>
</ul>
<p>By not washing or cleaning, the Survivor preserves important evidence. Without this evidence, it is difficult to prove in court 
that a rape occurred. When the Survivor's testimony is supported by objective evidence, then rape will be conclusively 
established. </p>
<p><strong>What The Police Need To Know Immediately </strong></p>
<p>When the Survivor calls the police emergency number, a dispatcher will request the following information: </p>
<ol>
<li>Her name and location; </li>
<li>Whether she is in need of emergency medical assistance; </li>
<li>When the assault occurred; </li>
<li>A brief description of the assailant, his vehicle, and his last known direction of travel; </li>
<li>Whether the assailant had a weapon. </li>
</ol>
<p>The dispatcher immediately sends an officer to the Survivor's location and broadcasts the assailant's description to the rest of 
the patrol force, alerting them to be on the lookout. </p>
<p>The Survivor can ask to speak with a female officer. The police make every effort to assign a woman to the case. </p>
<p>Frequently, though, the first report of a sexual assault is taken by a member of the patrol division on duty in the area. These 
uniformed officers can respond rapidly to the call because they are constantly on patrol throughout the community. </p>
<p>The officer will question the Survivor about the assault and obtain further information about the assailant. Unless the Survivor 
prefers to give a complete statement at this time, she will not be asked to discuss intimate details of the assault. </p>
<p><strong>Evidence Collection </strong></p>
<p>The police officer will want to know the location of the Survivor and the rapist, particularly at the time of the assault. An 
evidence technician skilled in handling and evaluating crime scenes will search the area. S/he will look for fingerprints, hair, 
blood, seminal fluid, bits of clothing, and any other indication of the assault. This is why it is crucial not to wash after the rape. </p>
<p>The Survivor can greatly assist the officer by pointing out where the assailant was, what he may have touched, and any other 
physical evidence she noticed. </p>
<p><strong>Other Important Help The Survivor Can Give </strong></p>
<p>The Survivor may be too upset to recall details immediately following the rape. Once she is calm, she should try to remember 
as much as she can about the rapist and exactly what happened when he attacked her. </p>
<p>It is important for the Survivor to try and remember: </p>
<ul>
<li>the rapist's height, weight, the color of his skin, hair and eyes, any facial oddities, scars or tattoos; </li>
<li>the color, style and type of clothing he wore; </li>
<li>any speech characteristics or accents; </li>
<li>exactly what the rapist said, including slang expressions or unusual comments; </li>
<li>the direction taken when he left; </li>
<li>the make, model, color and license number of his car (if he had one). </li>
</ul>
<p>At her first opportunity, the Survivor should write down everything she remembers about the attack. She may have already 
given information to the police, but as she concentrates, something new may come to mind. Writing down everything will help 
her if she has to testify in court. </p>
<p><strong>Advice For The Survivor Who Is An Illegal Alien </strong></p>
<p>Illegal aliens afraid of contact with police or other authorities may fear reporting sexual assault. Questions about citizenship, 
legal or parole status, are never asked of Survivors of violent crimes; but if the authorities learn of the illegal alien's status 
during the investigation, the information could be used in a deportation proceeding. </p>
<p><strong>The Follow-up Police Investigation </strong></p>
<p>Many police departments in the county and the sheriff's department have personnel especially trained in investigating the crime 
of sexual assault. An investigator assigned to the case will contact the Survivor within a few days after she reports the crime to 
the police. The Survivor must work closely with the investigators to help them apprehend the rapist. The Survivor may request 
a female investigator. </p>
<p><strong>The Interview With The Sexual Assault Investigator </strong></p>
<p>The detective will ask about the force and threats the rapist used against the Survivor, as well as any weapon the rapist used 
or said he would use. The detective will also ask her to recall anything she said or did to resist the rapist. These details help to 
establish that the Survivor did not agree to the sexual act, and help to prove the legal elements of the crime in court. </p>
<p>If the assailant was the Survivor's former boyfriend or if she knew him, she may be asked the nature of that relationship and if 
there had been similar attempts in the past. The Survivor will not be asked questions about her sexual history except as they 
relate to the rapist. A significant percentage of women are raped by men with whom the Survivor has had some form of prior 
contact, however slight. Thus, the rapist may not be a total stranger. The Survivor will not be asked if she enjoyed the assault 
or had an orgasm. </p>
<p>The detective will also ask questions about what happened before and after the rape. The Survivor must be candid and 
precise. She should not omit any details, even if she feels they weaken her account because in actuality this may not be the 
case. </p>
<p>However, if she has doubts about the appropriateness of some questions, she should ask the reasons for them, or refuse to 
answer them without the advice of her counsel. </p>
<p>The police officer should be able to explain the reason for every question. </p>
<p><strong>Photographs of Injuries </strong></p>
<p>The Survivor should report any cuts and bruises she received to the doctor (see Chapter IV on hospital procedures) and the 
detective. The detective may ask someone to take pictures of the injuries. Usually bruises do not appear for several hours and 
photographs can be taken later. This evidence may be extremely important after the cuts and bruises have healed and can no 
longer be seen. The Survivor does not have to consent to have the pictures taken, but she should know that such physical 
evidence can be very helpful to her case. </p>
<p><strong>Pictures Of Rapists (Mug Shots) </strong></p>
<p>The detective may ask the Survivor to identify the rapist from a picture. She will view mug shots of several men to try and 
identify the man who raped her. </p>
<p>The rapist's appearance may have changed considerably from the time the picture was taken and the Survivor might be unsure 
if the picture is of the rapist. </p>
<p>If the Survivor is asked to identify the rapist from mug shots, she will be asked to pick him out of a group of photos of men 
with similar characteristics (e.g., racial, age, coloring, etc.). The photos will be saved by the investigating officer for use at trial. </p>
<p><strong>The Polygraph Exam (Lie Detector Test) </strong></p>
<p>Polygraph examinations of Survivors are rarely used; and if so, only when the Survivor's credibility is questioned. </p>
<p>The police may ask the Survivor to take a polygraph examination. She does not have to agree to take it, but it may be 
advantageous to do so. A polygraph machine measures various bodily functions such as heart and breathing rates, and blood 
pressure. The polygraph expert will ask some neutral questions which have nothing to do with the rape, and some questions 
concerning the rape. The amount of change in the heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure indicates the truthfulness of 
the answer. Positive results from a polygraph exam can strengthen credibility. </p>
<p><strong>The Arrest Of The Suspect </strong></p>
<p>If the Survivor knows the rapist or has identified him from mug shots, the police can arrest him as a rape suspect. The 
detective may also find a suspect based on other evidence that the Survivor or others have given, such as a license plate 
number or description of his car. After the police identify a suspect, they normally obtain an arrest warrant signed by a judge 
and based on information supplied by the Survivor and the detectives. The police use this warrant to arrest the suspect. </p>
<p><strong>The Line-up</strong> </p>
<p>After the suspect's arrest, the detective may ask the Survivor to look at the man in a lineup of five or six men. During the 
lineup, the detective asks the men to turn and be viewed from all sides. This gives the Survivor a chance to concentrate on 
each man and to compare him to the other men. If she wants the men to do or say something that might help her recall how 
the rapist looked or sounded, she should tell the detective. Although the Survivor will be in the same room as the men, the 
lighting is arranged so that they will not be able to see her. If the Survivor is asked to identify the rapist in a lineup, she should 
be sure to pick him from a group. </p>
<p><strong>The Investigator's Report</strong> </p>
<p>The sexual assault investigator will write a report, and if the assailant is identified, the report will be sent to a deputy district 
attorney. He/she then reviews the report and determines if there is sufficient legal evidence to bring a criminal charge against 
the suspect. </p>
<p><strong>Juvenile Suspects</strong> </p>
<p>If the suspect is a juvenile, the rules for an arrest different from those for an adult suspect. The Survivor should ask the 
detective or prosecutor about any special juvenile procedures and if she will need to attend hearings and give testimony. </p>
<p><strong>Survivor's Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Survivor Has A Right To Have A Report Taken </strong></p>
<p>Under Penal Code Section 11107, each sheriff and police chief must give daily reports of felonies and misdemeanors 
committed in that area to the California Department of Justice. This implies that such reports must be made. </p>
<p>If a peace officer refuses to take a report of a crime, s/he may be disciplined, according to local regulations which require a 
crime report. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the crime's circumstances tend to disprove the occurrence of a reported crime. But the officer should still make a 
report, including in it those circumstances which dispute the crime's occurrence. Subsequent investigation should resolve the 
issue. </p>
<p>A separate matter is if the Survivor inaccurately describes the crime that occurred. For instance, if the circumstances indicate 
sodomy and not &quot;rape&quot; as the Survivor stated, then the officer should make a crime report of &quot;sodomy.&quot; The Survivor's 
inaccuracy should not detract from the reporting process. </p>
<p><strong>The Survivor Has A Right To Know The Status Of Her Case</strong> </p>
<p>An amendment to Government Code Section 6254 (f), effective January 1, 1977, requires local law enforcement agencies to 
inform Survivors of violent crime of witnesses and statements relative to their case. The Survivor should call the appropriate 
agency to find out if the case if under investigation, or has been completed. </p>
<p>If the case has been completed, (i.e., a disposition made), then the Survivor should be able to find out the disposition, as well 
as the circumstances and reasons for it. </p>
<p><strong>The Survivor Has A Right To Register A Complaint If She Is Dissatisfied </strong></p>
<p>If the Survivor is dissatisfied with the outcome of the case, either because no report was taken, or the case was not 
investigated or was dismissed, then she has a variety of remedies. </p>
<p>The Survivor may complain to the Internal Affairs Division of the local law enforcement agency or to the district attorney. 
Also, she could notify the county board of supervisors or the city council depending on whether the reporting agency was the 
sheriff&#185;s office or the, police department. </p>
<p><strong>The Decision To Press Criminal Charges</strong> </p>
<p>The criminal justice system on occasion may not seem to be supportive of the rape Survivor, because a criminal prosecution is 
not brought for the benefit of the Survivor. It is brought by the district attorney on behalf of the State of California to convict 
and punish a rapist. Some women do not have an unpleasant courtroom experience, but in any case, much time and energy 
are required. A woman may be made to feel that she is somehow responsible for the rape, and she must relive this trauma in 
the courtroom. </p>
<p>Many women decide not to press charges for fear of retaliation, while some do not believe that jail is the answer to rape. 
Some women do not want the rape and their personal lives examined in court. To compound matters, several conditions 
reduce the possibility the charges will reach the trial stage, such as whether the Survivor was hitchhiking, or was under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol. </p>
<p>A woman may want to press criminal charges because by initiating a court case, she forces the courts and the community to 
acknowledge that rape exists. Society will not condemn the existence and continuation of rape until the awareness of rape 
grows. Also, women may want to show that they will not react passively about their safety. Perhaps men would not rape as 
easily if they knew that women would fight back, both literally and legally. </p>
<p>Once the criminal prosecution is concluded, the Survivor should also consider bringing her own personal civil lawsuit against 
the rapist and others responsible for her injuries. The purpose of a civil suit is to benefit the Survivor and compensate her for 
the aftermath of rape she has suffered. A civil suit must be filed within one year after the attack. (See Chapter VII on 
Compensation for the Rape Survivor.) </p>
<p><a name="emergency"><strong>Chapter IV</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Why Immediate Medical Care Is Important </strong></p>
<p>Many Survivors experience a variety of physical symptoms after the attack. Some of these are caused by physical abuse or 
violence while others result from the Survivor's emotional distress. </p>
<p>These symptoms may include soreness, muscle tension, headaches, stomach pains, nausea and sleep disturbances. Common 
gynecological symptoms are vaginal discharge, itching, burning sensations, and generalized pain. There may be genital 
abrasions, lacerations or bleeding in the vaginal or rectal area. </p>
<p>Even if there is no discomfort or pain, the Survivor should receive medical attention. Many rape Survivors are in shock for 
varying amounts of time following the rape, and may not be as aware of their bodies and pain as they would be normally. For 
example, a Survivor may not be aware of internal injury or bleeding for several hours or days or she may not remember part 
of her rape experience. Because of the apparent shock, the danger of untreated internal injury and the possibility of venereal 
disease and pregnancy, every rape Survivor must seek immediate medical attention. </p>
<p>The rape Survivor's fundamental concern should be for her personal health and well-being. For this reason she should seek 
emergency medical attention as soon as possible. A Survivor may want her immediate examination from a family physician 
who is familiar with her medical history. The Survivor may relate better to a physician who knows her, and the physician may 
treat the Survivor more sympathetically because s/he knows the Survivor. Also, the physician may testify more readily at a 
later proceeding or trial on behalf of a patient s/he knows and understands. </p>
<p>Another concern is medical evidence. Unlike other crimes of violence, medical evidence that a rape has occurred should be 
collected within 12 to 72 hours after the attack. Even if the Survivor has decided not make a police report, the doctor will 
collect and record all possible evidence. If she changes her mind later, then this evidence can be used in arrest and court 
proceedings. </p>
<p>If the evidence is not collected within the allotted time by doctors who preserve and transfer it to the authorities, then it is of 
little use in court. The hospitals listed in this booklet train and instruct their staffs in the care of the rape Survivor and the 
collection and preservation of evidence. </p>
<p><strong>Getting In To See The Doctor </strong></p>
<p>If the police take the Survivor to the hospital, they will inform the intake worker, or triage nurse, that the woman is a rape 
Survivor and needs immediate medical care. If she is cooperating with the police, then the police department will pay for the 
medical tests needed for evidence. A police officer will assist the Survivor before and after the examination, but not during the 
examination. </p>
<p>If the Survivor comes in on her own, without the police, she should tell the receptionist that she is a rape Survivor. She may 
bring a friend or a rape counselor to the hospital. </p>
<p>If the Survivor prefers to see her own doctor, or to go to another hospital, she may do so. However, some hospitals may not 
have a doctor on duty, most will not collect the necessary evidence for prosecution of the case, and the Survivor will have to 
pay all costs. </p>
<p>An emergency room provides care to many people and attention is given to life-threatened persons first. Sometimes a person 
must wait due to the number of critical patients. At other times, the staff may be trying to arrange a few extra moments with 
the Survivor. Rape Survivors must not let an aide, a nurse, or anyone else clean off her body or assist her in douching before 
the medical examination. For the same reason, she should not use the bathroom. By refraining, she saves important evidence 
of the sexual assault. If the Survivor has already bathed, by force or by choice, she should tell the doctor. </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Paperwork&quot; Before You See The Doctor </strong></p>
<p>The nurse will explain hospital procedures and ask the Survivor about her medical history. The Survivor will then read two 
consent forms before the doctor examines her. One gives the hospital permission to examine and treat the Survivor. The other 
indicates whether or not she wants her medical record or any other evidence released to the police. The Survivor can cross 
out any sections she wishes before signing the forms. If the police have not been called, the nurse will ask if the Survivor 
wishes to make a police report. If so, the police will be notified immediately. </p>
<p><em>Under no circumstances</em> is a Survivor required to make a police report in order to receive emergency medical treatment. 
However, every physician and hospital in California is required by law to report the name, address, type of assault, nature and 
extent of injury of each Survivor of the violent crime treated. Even so, it does not constitute a formal police report that results 
in the prosecution of the rapist. The police cannot act, unless the Survivor personally reports the rape to them. The decision 
not to make a police report is a very serious one that may affect the Survivor's and other women's safety because rapists 
generally rape more than one woman. Fortunately, more women are reporting rape and cooperating with the police and the 
courts to control the problem of rape. </p>
<p>If the Survivor does not wish to report the crime to the police, she can still help to some degree. Other Survivors may have 
already reported similar rapes and described a rapist resembling the man who attacked her. A Survivor can ask the nurse, or 
a rape counselor to telephone the police if she wants to give information without actually reporting. The information may 
enable the police to arrest the rapist and protect other women. However, one problem is that some police departments will 
not take these reports. </p>
<p>After the Survivor has signed the appropriate forms, the nurse will help prepare her for the examination. She will be asked to 
remove her clothes and put on a hospital gown. The nurse will remain with her through the doctor's examination. When police 
departments require their official representative to be present during the examination, they always provide a female. Many 
police departments do not have such a requirement. </p>
<p><strong>Helping With The Assault Determination Examination </strong></p>
<p>The following procedures are used during the examination. In all cases, Survivors should feel free to ask the nurses, doctors or 
counselors any questions she has about the examination procedures. </p>
<p><strong>The General Examination </strong></p>
<p>The Survivor will be asked about her general state of health and about significant past medical history (i.e., if she is taking 
medication, has allergies). The doctor will perform a general physical exam which includes recording blood pressure, weight 
and temperature, and examining ears, eyes, mouth, heart, lungs, response and limbs. The doctor will ask specific questions 
about the sexual assault. They will include: </p>
<ul>
<li>The length of time between the rape and the examination; </li>
<li>Sexual acts that were performed during the rape (vaginal intercourse, oral intercourse, anal intercourse, other sexual 
acts, the degree of penetration, whether the male used a condom, and whether the male climaxed); </li>
<li>The date of her last menstrual cycle; </li>
<li>Her method of birth control; </li>
<li>The last date and time that she had consensual intercourse; </li>
<li>Any significant actions subsequent to the assault (showering, douching, changing clothes). </li>
</ul>
<p>The Survivor must tell the doctor what happened so that the doctor may give her proper treatment and obtain evidence of the 
assault. </p>
<p><strong>The Pelvic Examination </strong></p>
<p>The pelvic examination is similar to an annual examination and pap smear. The doctor checks external pelvic and internal 
genital areas for tears, cuts, bruises, or other signs that force was used. He will note these in the medical report. </p>
<p>The doctor will insert a speculum and then take smears and cultures from the vagina to test for semen, sperm cells, and 
venereal disease. If sperm cells are present, the doctor records whether the cells are alive and moving. The movement of the 
sperm cells helps the doctor confirm when the sexual acts took place. The doctor will need to know if and when the Survivor 
last had consensual sexual intercourse, to determine if the sperm cells were from the rape. </p>
<p>Many doctors will routinely perform a rectal examination during a rape examination. The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated 
index finger into the anal opening to feel for tears, or abrasions. If there is evidence of anal rape, then the doctor will take 
smears and cultures from the anal canal to test for sperm cells, semen, and venereal disease. This test is slightly uncomfortable, 
and pressure can be relieved during this brief exam by breathing slowly through an open mouth. </p>
<p><strong>Other Tests </strong></p>
<p>Other possible tests include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Fingernail scrapings. If the Survivor scratched or touched the rapist, any material found underneath the fingernails can 
be matched to the rapist, his clothing or things found at the scene of the crime. This may help identify the rapist or locate 
the exact place of the crime. </li>
<li>Wood's lamp exam. In a dark room this lamp causes semen left on the Survivor's body or clothing to glow in the dark 
(fluorescence). The fluorescence is not evidence, but it suggests areas of the body or clothing that should be examined 
more carefully. </li>
<li>Pubic hair exam. This test includes combing the pubic area for hairs which may have come from the rapist. These hairs, 
if found, can be matched with hairs later clipped from the rapist to help prove his identity. Several of the Survivor's 
pubic hairs will be removed to compare with any loose ones. If indicated, appropriate photographs of the assaulted 
areas may be requested. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Testing For Venereal Disease </strong></p>
<p>The Survivor may have contracted venereal disease from the assailant. The doctor cannot diagnose this immediately, but s/he 
will take blood tests and cultures to aid in the diagnosis. The doctor may offer preventive medication, usually penicillin. (If she 
is allergic to penicillin, she should inform the doctor so that alternative medications can be used.) </p>
<p>If she takes preventive medication, at the hospital, she is unlikely to contract venereal disease from the assault, but she must 
have follow-up tests. Her private physician or the hospital will arrange for follow-up retesting. </p>
<p>These tests are needed because of ten a woman does not have any outward signs that she has a venereal disease. Because 
gonorrhea and syphilis can greatly harm the body and the reproductive system, and can endanger life, Survivors should be 
very careful that they are retested at the right times. Also, until follow-up tests show that venereal disease is not present, it is 
possible to infect someone else through oral, anal, or genital contact. </p>
<p>Because of the severe emotional trauma caused by rape, Survivors are often advised to reestablish normal sexual relationships 
as soon as possible. Prophylactics offer protection during intercourse against venereal disease. </p>
<p>A gonorrhea test requires taking a culture from the vagina. It takes four to seven days for the disease to develop to the point 
of detection. Syphilis is detected by examining a blood sample, and takes about six weeks to develop. </p>
<p>Free tests and treatment are available at public health clinics or at women's clinics. The Survivor should contact a clinic or 
physician for a gonorrhea test within four to seven days after the rape and again within six to eight weeks for a syphilis test. </p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy Testing </strong></p>
<p>If the Survivor was not using some form of birth control at the time of the rape, she may worry about becoming pregnant. 
Although it is not certain that the Survivor will become pregnant as a result of the rape, the doctor will talk to her about 
methods to prevent pregnancy. If she knows or suspects that she is already pregnant, she must tell the doctor. </p>
<p>The emergency physician can offer medications which will terminate the pregnancy. This hormone will cause the Survivor to 
have a menstrual period in approximately three days. It is usually given as a shot since the pill form has to be taken over 
several days and may cause unpleasant side effects. Side effects include nausea, headache, breast tenderness and warm 
&quot;flashes.&quot; </p>
<p>Before the doctor gives pregnancy-preventing drugs to her, the Survivor must give a urine sample to determine if she was 
pregnant before the attack. No drugs will be given if the Survivor is presently pregnant or chooses not to have them. </p>
<p>The Survivor may decide to wait and see if she misses a menstrual period. If so, a doctor 'may give medication to bring it on. 
However, this does not rule out the possibility of pregnancy. </p>
<p>The Survivor should have a pregnancy test soon after the rape occurs. If the test establishes that the Survivor is pregnant as a 
result of the rape, then she has enough time to think about her options. If she decides to carry the pregnancy to term, then she 
will want early. pre-natal medical attention. </p>
<p>If she decides to terminate the pregnancy, a doctor can perform the procedure early. </p>
<p>It is important for her to discuss her choices with her doctor and her counselor. She may also want to talk it over with her 
family and friends. </p>
<p><strong>Before leaving The Emergency Room </strong></p>
<p>The Survivor should read or have read to her the medical report, in order to request any important changes or additions. 
Often bruises do not appear for several hours or days after an injury, but the doctor should note any soreness or tenderness. </p>
<p>If possible the Survivor should bring a change of clothing with her, as the police may collect some of her clothing for evidence; 
(especially underpants and articles with semen or blood stains). The hospital may provide a shower after the examination and 
panties to wear home. </p>
<p>The nurse or the doctor will instruct the Survivor on care of her injuries, venereal disease follow-up information, and 
medication if prescribed. Many Survivors have difficulty sleeping, so they may want to ask for a low-dosage sleeping 
medication or tranquilizer. </p>
<p>The police may wish to question the Survivor further, and will ask her to come with them to the station. She has the right to 
make an appointment to meet them at a later time is she feels unable to continue. In any case, the Survivor should read the 
completed police report carefully and make any needed additions or corrections. She should write down the telephone 
numbers and names of the police contacts, the investigative officer, the detective who will be handling the case, the doctor 
who examined her, and her counselor. </p>
<p>Survivors should arrange for a safe place to stay for the night. If she was raped in her home, she should arrange to stay at a 
friend's place, with her family or in a hotel. If she wants to return to her home, she should arrange for a friend or a family 
member to stay with her. She should contact a hotline or mental health center for counseling and advocacy before or 
immediately after leaving the hospital or police station, and make an appointment for the next day, or earlier, if possible. </p>
<p>Survivors should arrange for transportation from the hospital to the place where she is staying with family, friends, or the 
police. If she called the police into the case, they will take her from the hospital or police station to her destination. </p>
<p>It is important for a Survivor to plan her next few days (go to work, shop, seek counseling, etc.). She should try to continue as 
normal a routine as possible. </p>
<p>Once in safe surroundings she can take a bath, wash her hair, eat a good meal and try to get some sleep. </p>
<p><a name="municipal"><strong>Chapter V</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>The Deputy District Attorney (Prosecutor) </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decision To Charge The Suspect </strong></p>
<p>Very soon after the suspect's arrest, the district attorney's office must review the case to determine if there is sufficient 
evidence and a reasonable chance of convicting the suspected rapist. If so, a formal complaint is issued (charges are brought 
against the suspect) and filed with the court. </p>
<p>In making this decision, the deputy district attorney (DDA) judges the strength of the case by considering the supporting 
physical evidence collected in the emergency room, the Survivor's potential as a witness, and the availability of other 
witnesses. S/he may consider it necessary to interview the Survivor before filing charges. This is often done to verify the 
accuracy of the information in the police report, to obtain additional information, and to explain what to expect from the 
judicial process. </p>
<p>It is within the DDA's discretion to permit Survivors to have a friend or counselor present at interviews with the DDA. During 
the interview, the DDA will ask the Survivor to review the details of the rape to help determine whether to file charges against 
the suspect. The DDA will ask very specific questions. </p>
<p>The Survivor should ask any questions that she may have. </p>
<p>She may be concerned about personal information that might be brought out during the trial. She should discuss with the DDA 
how s/he will control this information during the trial. </p>
<p>During the interview, the Survivor should ask the DDA to explain words or procedures that she does not understand. Also, 
she should make sure that she has a name and telephone number to call in case she has additional questions or information for 
the DDA. Sometimes, the DDA decides not to file charges against the suspect. If this happens, she should ask the DDA about 
this decision, since the Survivor has a right to know why the case will not go to court. If the Survivor is not satisfied with the 
decision, she may ask for a review of the matter with the DDA's supervisor. </p>
<p>In Santa Clara County, rape and related cases are assigned in advance to one of the preliminary deputies who will work with 
the case prior to the time of the hearing. The DDA at the preliminary examination may not be the same DDA assigned to the 
case in superior court for trial. </p>
<p>All rape cases are prosecuted in Superior Court by the District Attorney's Rape Team, which is composed of senior deputies. </p>
<p><strong>The Defense Attorney </strong></p>
<p>The accused has a right to have a lawyer represent him at all stages of the proceedings against him. This person is called the 
defense attorney, and may be either an attorney hired by the accused or one assigned to the case by the public defender's 
office. Whether the defense attorney is paid by the defendant or by public funds, it is her/his duty to work solely for the 
defendant's interests. </p>
<p>The defense receives copies of all statements taken by the police. The defendant's attorney or his investigator may contact the 
Survivor and request an interview. </p>
<p>Do not confuse the public defender's office with the district attorney's office. It is also important not to confuse defense 
investigators with police investigators. The Survivor should always ask for identification and the purpose in contacting her. </p>
<p>The Survivor need not talk with any representative of the person charged with the offense. If she does not want to speak with 
him, she should refuse, but this fact will be raised at trial. </p>
<p>If the Survivor chooses to discuss the case, she is free to do so. She may want to consult the district attorney or police 
investigator beforehand. If she gives a statement to a defense investigator, she may choose to do so at either the police station 
or district attorney's office, with both the investigator and DDA present at that time. </p>
<p>If the Survivor's statement is put in writing, she is not required to sign the statement. If she decides to sign the statement, she 
should review it very carefully to assure that it is an accurate account of what occurred. The Survivor should retain a copy of 
any statements she signs. </p>
<p>If the defense contacts her, the Survivor should inform the police investigator of the nature of the contact as soon as possible. </p>
<p><strong>The Arraignment At Municipal Court </strong></p>
<p>Once the case has been charged, an arraignment date is set, and the accused rapist must appear at a municipal court. The 
Survivor does not have to appear at the municipal court arraignment. </p>
<p>At the arraignment, the judge reads the formal list of charges to the accused, who then pleads guilty or not guilty. (Once a 
suspect is formally charged, he is called the defendant.) The judge makes sure the defendant understands his constitutional 
rights and that he will be represented by an attorney during the court proceedings. The Survivor does not have--to appear at 
the arraignment; however, the defendant, his attorney, and the DDA must be present. </p>
<p>If the defendant pleads guilty, he will be referred to the Adult Probation Department for evaluation for his sentencing hearing 
and the judge will set a sentencing date. If he pleads not guilty, the judge sets a date for the preliminary hearing. </p>
<p><strong>The Preliminary Hearing </strong></p>
<p><strong>A Court Proceeding To Determine Whether Trial Is Warranted </strong></p>
<p>After the arraignment, the DDA presents the facts to a judge at a preliminary hearing in municipal court. There is no jury at this 
stage of the proceeding. </p>
<p>The hearing determines whether the prosecutor (representing the People of the State of California) can show sufficient 
evidence that a crime was committed and that the person accused is probably the person who did it. The judge will decide 
whether there is probable cause to warrant a trial. </p>
<p>Cases of this type are given priority for preliminary examination and later trial. The court recognizes the seriousness of the 
offense, and that the matter should be decided at the earliest possible time. This relates not only to the preliminary examination 
in the municipal court, but also in superior court for setting trial and for the trial itself. A greater majority of these cases 
proceed to trial than any other felony case. First, usually there are no witnesses to the offense other than the Survivor and the 
defendant, and second, if the defendant is found guilty, the penalty is severe. 'the Survivor should be prepared to testify not 
only at examination in municipal court, but also at trial in superior court. </p>
<p>The Survivor will be advised by means of a subpoena (a legal notice ordering her to appear in court) of the hearing's date and 
location. Usually, the DDA will contact the Survivor before the hearing, to prepare her for the court appearance. The Survivor 
need no longer give her address aloud in the courtroom, although she must give her name and occupation when she is sworn in 
to testify. </p>
<p>In the court proceedings, the Survivor will be referred to as a &quot;witness for the prosecution&quot; or a &quot;witness for the state,&quot; 
because a sexual assault is legally considered a crime against the state as well as against the individual. Therefore, the DDA 
prosecutes the case on behalf of the state, not on behalf of the Survivor directly. The state becomes the accuser, and the 
Survivor is a major witness for the prosecution. </p>
<p>The accused and his attorney will be present at the hearing. The Constitution provides that the accused person is entitled to a 
public trial. However, a preliminary hearing is not a trial and the defense can request the exclusion of all spectators. Only the 
accused can request a private hearing. </p>
<p>In a private preliminary hearing, the law provides that the judge may allow the prosecuting witness to have someone present 
for moral support. The person she chooses cannot discuss the testimony with any other witness. </p>
<p>During the hearing, the Survivor as the prosecuting witness will be called to testify. At that time, the DDA will ask questions to 
establish that there is probable cause to conclude that the defendant committed the crime and should stand trial. S/he will also 
have to ask if the prosecuting witness has ever been married to the defendant, and if she recognizes her assailant in the 
courtroom. If she does, she will be asked to point him out. </p>
<p>The defendant's attorney has the right to cross examine and to ask for details of the assault. A recent law has made it difficult 
for the defense attorney to ask questions about past sexual experiences, unless the judge decides they are relevant to the case. 
The DDA will try to prevent these questions from being ask ed. </p>
<p>The DDA may call other witnesses to testify if s/he feels they are necessary. Usually the defense does not present evidence 
and the suspect does not testify at the preliminary hearing. </p>
<p>After both sides finish, the judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence to send the case to superior court for trial. If 
the judge does not believe there is enough evidence, the charges will be dismissed and the accused will be released 
immediately. However, most cases are sent to superior court. </p>
<p><strong>How The Suspect Can Gain Release</strong> </p>
<p>Rapists may threaten to attack their Survivors again to discourage them from making a police report. Although threats to 
return are common, a second attack is extremely rare. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Survivors worry about their personal safety and whether the rapist will return. They want to know what 
happens to the rapist if he is arrested, how long he will be in jail, and whether they can prevent his release. </p>
<p>If a suspect is arrested after the Survivor makes a police report, he will be held in jail during the prosecution unless: </p>
<ol>
<li>the charges against him are dropped; </li>
<li>he posts bail; or </li>
<li>the judge releases him on his own recognizance (without \bail). </li>
</ol>
<p>In our legal system, every accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. A person is arrested because he is 
believed to be the person who committed the crime. Thus, the detective and the prosecutor will often call the person who is 
under arrest &quot;the suspect,&quot; &quot;the accused,&quot; &quot;the alleged rapist,&quot; or &quot;the defendant.&quot; Even if the Survivor knows that the suspect 
is the man who raped her, he is considered innocent until he confesses his guilt or is proven guilty in a trial. </p>
<p><strong>Bail </strong></p>
<p>Since any person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty, a judge must set bail. Bail is an amount of 
money the defendant must post if he wants to stay out of jail until his case is decided. The defendant must either pay the entire 
amount of bail or pay a percentage of the set amount to a bail bondsman, who arranges for posting a bond in the amount of 
the bail. Bail is used to assure that the defendant will attend all of his court appearances. </p>
<p><strong>Release On Own Recognizance (often referred to as &quot;O.R.)</strong> </p>
<p>Occasionally, a judge may release a defendant on his own recognizance, which means he need not post bail. The judge bases 
the decision on information about the suspect's background (residence, family, means of support, criminal history). </p>
<p>The defendant's release from custody is prohibited until the defendant has filed a signed release agreement. Such an agreement 
includes the defendant's promise to appear in court on all scheduled dates, and to not leave the state without the court's 
permission. </p>
<p>The judge must believe that the suspect will return for future court appearances in order to release the defendant. In addition 
the court may consider the severity of a potential sentence as it effects the likelihood the defendant will not return for future 
court hearings. The Survivor may influence the judge's decision if the suspect cannot post bail and requests release through this 
procedure. The Survivor should ask the investigator or the DDA if she can include a statement in the report to the judge. The 
statement should express concern for her personal safety and should mention any threats, violent behavior, or injuries inflicted 
by the suspect, or by anyone associated with him. </p>
<p>Upon releasing the suspect on bail or on his own recognizance, the judge instructs him that he is not to see or talk to the 
Survivor at any time or in any way. If the suspect or anyone associated with him contacts the Survivor, she should report the 
circumstances immediately to the detective. Any violation of the conditions of his release can be grounds for the judge to 
increase his bail or return him to jail. </p>
<p><a name="superior"><strong>Chapter VI</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Superior Court Arraignment </strong></p>
<p>This process is basically the same as the municipal court arraignment, except that a superior court judge presides. The 
Survivor does not have to appear at this arraignment. However, the defendant, his attorney, and the DDA must be present. </p>
<p>In some limited cases the district attorney may choose to institute criminal proceedings by indicting the defendant. If he selects 
the indictment course, then the district attorney will not file a complaint in the municipal court. Instead, the DDA will present 
testimony describing the crime to the county grand jury. If 12 of the 23 grand jurors find that there is probable cause to 
conclude that this case should go to trial, then the foreperson of the grand jury signs a &quot;true bill of indictment.&quot; When the 
district attorney follows this procedure, the indictment is filed in the superior court and after arraignment, a preliminary hearing 
(as previously described in the municipal court) will be scheduled. </p>
<p><strong>Pretrial Hearing</strong> </p>
<p>At the pretrial hearing, the court hears various procedural motions, such as discovery motions (disclosure of evidence before 
trial), motions to suppress illegally obtained evidence, motions for consolidation or severance (in cases where there are 
multiple defendants), or motions relating to the admissibility of identification evidence. There are approximately 70 different 
legal motions that could arise during the pendency of any case. </p>
<p>The DDA and defense attorney may enter into plea negotiations at this time by discussing the issues presented by the case and 
negotiating a conclusion, if possible, without trial. The Survivor may have to appear and testify at a pretrial conference 
depending which motion or motions are being heard and considered. The DDA will notify her in advance if her testimony is 
required at this hearing. </p>
<p>Before trial, the defense attorney may seek a psychiatric interview. However, according to a legislative mandate, effective 
January 1, 1981, all psychiatric interviews with the Survivor will be forbidden. In the meantime, the Survivor's refusal to 
submit to a psychiatric interview will be used against her at trial. The Survivor should agree to an examination only if the 
defendant agrees to such an examination as well. </p>
<p>A felony case settlement policy is followed by the district attorney's office. A defendant charged with a felony must plead to a 
felony charge(s) in the degree which accurately reflects the portion of the defendant's conduct for which there is sufficient 
evidence required by law for conviction, or proceed to trial. The essential part of the defendant's conduct is the controlling 
factor in case settlement or plea bargaining. </p>
<p>A DDA usually does not agree to the settlement of a case, by way of plea or submission on the transcript, which seeks to 
include any sentencing representations or commitments. </p>
<p>This policy is especially followed in cases involving forcible rape, sodomy, or oral copulation. </p>
<p><strong>Plea Bargains </strong></p>
<p>A plea bargain is a compromise between the prosecutor and the defense interests whereby the defendant pleads guilty to a 
crime in exchange for some leniency and the certainty of knowing the exact crime for which he will be punished. The 
prosecutor is not required to go to trial, the Survivor does not have to testify in an open court, and there is no chance of losing 
the case at trial. </p>
<p>The plea bargain can take many forms. If the defendant was involved in more than one crime, the prosecutor may agree to 
drop some charges if the defendant agrees to plead guilty to at least one crime. The prosecutor may agree to reduce the 
charge of rape to a less serious crime. The prosecutor may recommend a lesser punishment to the judge in return for the 
accused's guilty plea, which would conclude the case except for the defendant's sentencing. </p>
<p>This plea by the defendant must be acceptable to his attorney, the DDA, and ultimately the judge. The defendant will not be 
allowed to plead guilty, unless his plea is acceptable to all parties. Although the DDA will be representing the interests of the 
State of California in the case, the Survivor should discuss with him/her the possible plea and sentencing of the defendant to 
the pretrial date. If the Survivor is dissatisfied with the bargain, she has a right to a full explanation. </p>
<p>The Survivor is entitled to: </p>
<ol>
<li>a-complete explanation of all court procedures; </li>
<li>a complete explanation of any decisions by the DDA affecting the case; </li>
<li>be informed of the status of her case; </li>
<li>request a personal meeting with the 'district attorney or the DDA's supervisor; </li>
<li>know the defendant's sentence or the final disposition of the case (Penal Code Section 11116.10). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pretrial Motions </strong></p>
<p><strong>Continuances and Postponements </strong></p>
<p>Since courts have many cases to hear, there may be several postponements (&quot;continuances&quot;) before the Survivor actually 
testifies. She will receive a new notice each time there is a postponement. Continuances may be requested by either the 
defense or the prosecution. Survivors should be aware that the DDA is in a position to object to a postponement. </p>
<p>The defendant is entitled to a speedy and public trial under the California and the United States Constitutions. In California, 
the defendant is entitled to a trial within 60 days of the filing of the case in superior court, while the prosecution has no such 
right. The defendant, however, can waive his right to a speedy trial within those 60 days and, as a rule, most defendants do. </p>
<p><strong>Hearings On Relevant Evidence </strong></p>
<p>It is extremely difficult for the defendant's attorney to ask questions in open court about the Survivor's past sexual experiences. 
The law currently requires the defense to file a written document with the court, explaining what it believes the Survivor's 
background will show and its relevance to the defense. This generally occurs in cases where the Survivor was previously 
involved with the defendant, and if so, a hearing is held outside the presence of the jury. </p>
<p>At this hearing, the Survivor will be questioned about her background. If the judge determines that her past sexual experiences 
are relevant to the case, she will have to answer the questions. However, if the judge finds that her past sexual experiences 
have no bearing upon the case, s/he will inform the defense attorney that s/he may not question the Survivor about those 
matters. </p>
<p><strong>The Trial </strong></p>
<p>If there is a trial, it will probably occur several months after the rape. The prosecutor will know the trial date in advance. The 
Survivor should inform the detective and prosecutor where she can be reached because they may want to prepare her for the 
trial. Such preparations include reviewing police statements and examining pictures and diagrams of the crime scene. If the 
Survivor has never been to a trial, she may want to become familiar with the surroundings by visiting the courtroom, or by 
observing another trial in session. </p>
<p>At trial, the defendant can choose whether to have the judge or jury hear his case. If he waives the right to a trial by jury and 
the prosecution agrees, a judge will hear the case and determine the verdict instead of a jury. If he asks for a jury, the 
defendant's lawyer and the prosecutor will select the members of the jury. </p>
<p>Both the prosecution and defense present all the available evidence at the trial. The Survivor's role here will be similar to her 
role at the preliminary hearing. She will testify to basically the same information and she may be excluded from the courtroom 
when she is not on the witness stand. Usually, witnesses from either side are not allowed in the courtroom except when 
testifying. However, the Survivor may bring friends, relatives, or other supportive people with her. </p>
<p>It is not easy to testify, but it is not as hard as television and movies portray it. The prosecutor will ask simple questions, 
knowing the answers in advance. The Survivor's job is to tell the truth clearly and fully. If she does not understand a question, 
she should ask the attorney to repeat it or reword it. </p>
<p>When the prosecutor finishes asking questions, the defendant's lawyer will begin the cross-examination. These questions will 
be more detailed and may be harder to answer than those asked by the prosecutor. Survivors should pause and think before 
answering and ask the judge or the defendant's attorney to explain questions she does not understand. </p>
<p>As a witness, she should: </p>
<ul>
<li>remain calm and collected; </li>
<li>listen carefully to all questions; </li>
<li>not guess; </li>
<li>not volunteer any information; </li>
<li>not get angry. </li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone asks a question that the Survivor thinks should not have been asked, she may ask the judge's opinion. If the judge 
tells her to answer, she must do so. The Survivor may think some questions are arbitrary, but they may be necessary to satisfy 
the law. </p>
<p>She should always ask attorneys to explain questions that she does not understand. </p>
<p>If the questioning becomes too intensive while the Survivor is on the stand, she should ask the judge if she could please have a 
few moments before continuing. </p>
<p>The suspect does not have to testify, in which case the jury is told not to hold that against him. After all the evidence is 
presented and each lawyer gives a final statement, the judge tells the jury what laws apply to the case. The case is' then given 
to the jury to decide if the defendant is guilty. </p>
<p><strong>Types Of Verdicts</strong> </p>
<p>At the trial, the prosecutor must introduce enough evidence about the suspect's guilt to erase any reasonable doubt in the 
minds of the jurors or judge. A finding of not guilty does not mean that the defendant did not commit the crime or that the 
Survivor has not told the truth. It may simply mean that there was not enough evidence for the jury to believe that the 
defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>If all the members of the jury cannot come to the same verdict, they are called a &quot;hung jury.&quot; In this case, the court will 
probably order a new trial for a later date. </p>
<p>If the defendant was found not guilty, he will be released immediately. If the defendant is convicted, the court will set the case 
for hearing on the defendant's sentencing. Because other witnesses may be called and because a jury may have to reach a 
verdict, the Survivor may not be present in the courtroom when the verdict is announced. After the trial, the DDA will advise 
her of the outcome. </p>
<p><strong>The Sentencing Stage </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Probation Department </strong></p>
<p>If the defendant is found guilty or if he pleads guilty, then the probation department receives the case. It may be weeks or 
months before he receives the sentence stating his punishment. </p>
<p>During this time, the probation officer will prepare an evaluation report which includes an interview with the defendant; the 
defendant's personal statement; detailed background information; and statements from the police inspector, witnesses, and 
references. </p>
<p>The probation officer will want to interview the Survivor and include her statements in the report. S/he will contact the 
Survivor (or her parents if she is under 18) by mail and ask to make an appointment. During the interview, the probation 
officer will ask her to describe the assault and any violent behavior by the defendant. The Survivor's statement is a very 
important part of the pre-sentence report, because the probation officer will make sentencing recommendations based on 
information gathered for this report. </p>
<p><strong>The Sentence</strong> </p>
<p>At the sentencing, the judge may or may not follow the probation department's recommendations. The sentence imposed is 
the judge's decision within the guidelines of the law. The DDA will contact the Survivor to inform her of the details of the 
sentence. The prosecutor will also recommend a ' sentence. If the Survivor wishes to make a recommendation, she should 
inform the prosecutor. The prosecutor may suggest that the Survivor write a letter for submission to the judge or that she 
attend the sentencing in order to express her view. </p>
<p>Any letter written by the Survivor should be submitted to the probation officer in advance of the sentencing date. Probation is 
not a sentencing choice in this type of case; either state prison or a state hospital facility is the only alternative. </p>
<p><strong>Punishment Of The Guilty</strong> </p>
<p>The sentence for rape according to the 1979 amendment to the Penal Code section 264 is three, six, or eight years in state 
prison. The convicted defendant could possibly be sentenced to three years if mitigating circumstances are present or to eight 
years if aggravating circumstances are shown. However, he is entitled to one-third off his sentence for good behavior while in 
prison. </p>
<p>A convicted rapist cannot receive probation under California law if he prevented the Survivor from resisting by threat of great 
and immediate bodily harm or if the Survivor resisted but was overcome by force or violence. The judge sets the conditions 
which the defendant must fulfill to remain out of prison during the period of his probation. </p>
<p>The Board of Prison Terms makes all decisions concerning parole, and the Survivor will not be notified when the rapist is 
released. </p>
<p>If the rapist is considered a &quot;mentally disordered sex offender&quot; as defined by section 290 of the Penal Code, then he will be 
committed to a state hospital for an indefinite period of time. </p>
<p>Further, any convicted rapist or mentally disordered sex offender who has been sentenced to state prison must register with 
the city chief of police or county sheriff within 30 days of arriving in any county or city where he plans to reside, even if 
temporarily. All convicted rapists if placed on probation must, during the pendency of their probation, register as well. </p>
<p>The registration documents include the rapist's signed statement of information required by the Department of Justice, and his 
fingerprints and photograph. </p>
<p>If the convicted rapist willfully violates his duty to register, then he is guilty of a misdemeanor and must serve a term of not less 
than 10 days, nor more than one year in the county jail. </p>
<p><strong>The Appeal </strong></p>
<p>If the accused is found guilty, he may appeal the decision of the court. An appeal means that legal questions decided during 
the trial will be reviewed by another court to see if there were any errors made during the trial. The appeal often takes months, 
even years. The Survivor need not be present at the appellate argument. The court can release any accusee-from jail during an 
appeal. If the jury finds the accused not guilty, neither the Survivor nor the prosecutor can appeal the decision. </p>
<p><a name="compensation"><strong>Chapter VII</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Compensation for the Rape Survivor</strong></p>
<p>The Survivor may sue the rapist, or other persons legally responsible, for her injuries for money damages, even if the district 
attorney does not prosecute her case or if the rapist is not convicted at a criminal trial. </p>
<p>In a civil suit for her personal injuries, the Survivor need only prove her case by a &quot;preponderance of the evidence.&quot; The 
heavier burden of proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; only applies to criminal prosecutions. In a civil case, the Survivor can 
ask for money damages in either a court or jury trial. Such a trial is directly for her benefit and, unlike a criminal prosecution, is 
brought expressly on her behalf against the individuals responsible for her injuries. </p>
<p>She may sue the owner of the property where the rape occurred, if his negligence contributed to cause her injuries. The 
negligent apartment house or motel owner who failed to provide proper security can be held responsible for injuries to the 
rape Survivor. Other potential persons who have been held responsible for a rape Survivor's injuries include: lock 
manufacturers, owners and managers of unlighted premises (i.e., parking lots and hallways), locksmiths, architects and building 
contractors. These people have a duty to protect against known dangers, and at a minimum, to warn of any potential hazards 
presented to women. </p>
<p>The Survivor may represent herself in a civil suit but should hire an attorney, preferably one experienced in handling personal 
injury litigation. </p>
<p>A civil suit must be filed within one year after the rape. For this reason it is important to promptly retain an attorney. </p>
<p>Many lawyers offer their services on a &quot;contingency feel' basis and do not charge in advance. If the suit is successful, these 
attorneys receive a pre-agreed percentage of the recovery. If the case is unsuccessful, the rape Survivor owes nothing. </p>
<p>Although most civil suits settle before trial, if her case proceeds to a verdict, the Survivor is entitled to financial compensation 
for all of her injuries and damages including the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Doctors, hospital, surgery and other medical expenses incurred by the Survivor; </li>
<li>Psychiatric, psychological or other counseling expenses; </li>
<li>Rehabilitative services, including job retraining; </li>
<li>The Survivor's lost wages or if not employed, the reasonable value of her lost time due to the rape; and </li>
<li>The pain, humiliation, fears, anxiety, mental anguish and emotional distress suffered as result of the rape. </li>
</ol>
<p>The dollar amount of any award would be determined by the judge or jury hearing the case and would be based upon the 
facts presented by her attorney. </p>
<p>In cases where a financially solvent third party is not legally responsible, suing a rapist who currently has no financial resources 
may not seem worthwhile, but the Survivor can obtain a legal judgment enforceable for a ten-year period, which may become 
collectable. Circumstances change, and the financial picture of today's rapist could improve tomorrow. </p>
<p>Another form of Survivor compensation (not to exceed: $10,000 for medical, $10,000 for loss of wages, $3,000 job 
retraining) is available through California&#185;s Aid to Victims of Violent Crimes Act (section 13959 of the Government Code). In 
order to receive financial assistance from the State Board of Control, the rape Survivor must have: </p>
<ul>
<li>been a resident of California at the time of the assault; </li>
<li>cooperated with law enforcement agencies; and </li>
<li>suffered pecuniary loss. </li>
</ul>
<p>Expenses which may be reimbursed include medical/hospitalization and counseling fees, loss of wages or support, and job 
retraining or rehabilitative services. Coverage may also include attorney's fees, traveling expenses, child care, and &quot;other 
necessary expenses directly related to the injury.&quot; Also eligible are members of the Survivors family, or persons with a close 
relationship to the Survivor, who were present during the commission of the rape. </p>
<p>Effective January 1, 1981, the State Board of Control will advance up to $1,000 in compensation in cases where a Survivor 
has suffered a loss of income or support which creates an emergency for her. Disbursements are to be made within twenty 
business days from receipt of an application by the Board of Control. </p>
<p>If the Survivor does not receive an application form from the police, she should call the Victim Witness Assistance Program 
(See page 49), a rape hotline (See page 44), or write to the State Board of Control, 926 &quot;J&quot; Street, Suite 300, Sacramento, 
CA 95814. </p>
<p>The Survivor may obtain assistance in completing the application forms and in processing her claim from the National 
Conference of Christians and Jews Victim Witness Assistance Program, a private, non-profit agency funded by the State of 
California through Santa Clara County to assist Survivors of crime. </p>
<p>If the Survivor did not report the crime to the police, then her personal accident or medical insurance should cover the cost of 
medical exams. If she did not have personal insurance, she should ask the doctor, her rape counselor, or her attorney about 
financial assistance in paying medical bills. </p>

<h2>Consumers' Rights in the Legal Marketplace:</h2>
<h3>Problems of Contingency Fee Clients Who Change Attorneys</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>
<h3>Published in September 1979 in the California State Bar Journal, Vol. 54, No. 5</h3>
<p><strong>Special Notice</strong></p>
<p>This article was published by Richard Alexander in September 1979 in the California State Bar Journal as a proposal for 
modifying a decision of the California Supreme Court that failed to consider the needs of consumers when changing attorneys. 
While this article is not a current statement of California law, the proposal made in 1979 now has been adopted as the rule of 
law in California and for that I am pleased. RA 10.18.96 </p>
<hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">The Alexander Law Firm</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com], a medium size law firm specializing in individual and class action litigation arising from negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, mass accident, environmental and fraud cases on behalf of consumers and small businesses. The firm holds Martindale-Hubbell's highest rating and is recognized in the List of Preeminent Law Firms in the United States. The firm sponsors <a href=http://consumerlawpage.com>The Consumer Law Page</a> [http://consumerlawpage.com] on the World Wide Web. Copyright Richard Alexander 1996.</font></p>
<hr>

<p>In 1972 in Fracasse v. Brent <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, the California Supreme Court established a new rule of damages in actions by attorneys 
seeking payment of attorney&#185;s fees from clients who had retained counsel under a contingency fee contract but who 
subsequently discharged their attorney before the contingency occurred. The court, speaking through Justice burke, held that 
under these circumstances, an attorney is limited to a quantum meruit recovery, i.e., the reasonable value of services provided 
once the contingency has occurred.</p>
<p>While the holding in Fracasse is commendable, it has created problems which require further attention in order to protect the 
consumer and further promote the principle that a client should be able to change counsel at will. </p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>When a contingency client discharges Lawyer A and consults Lawyer B, normally Lawyer A and Lawyer B can agree, after 
full disclosure to the client, to allocate the contingency fee arising from the client&#185;s case based upon the work performed by 
each attorney. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The client should also be advised that in the event they cannot agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will owe to Lawyer A the reasonable value of Lawyer A&#185;s services, should the contingency occur;</li>
<li>Client will still be obligated to Lawyer B for Lawyer B's services;</li>
<li>Lawyer A, under current California law is required to sue the client to enforce his quantum meruit claim, even if Lawyer 
B agrees to indemnify and hold the client harmless against Lawyer A's claim. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, consumers are discouraged from changing attorneys freely. A more workable solution must remove this burden 
from the consumer. </p>
<p><strong>Case Law</strong></p>
<p>Prior to Fracasse, an attorney discharged under a contingent fee contract could recover the full amount of the contract from 
the client under the watershed rule of Baldwin v. Bennett. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The rationale behind this holding was that the client was deemed 
to have breached the contract, thereby becoming liable to the lawyer for the agreed fee. The contract price rule was 
specifically held applicable to contingent fee contracts in Bartlett v. Odd Fellows' Savings Bank <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> where the court also held 
that the wrongfully discharged attorney's cause of action accrued at the happening of the contingency and not at the time of 
discharge.</p>
<p>Fracasse reversed the contract price rule, reaffirming the consumer's absolute right to discharge counsel.<a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Such discharge 
does not discharge the attorney's lien itself <a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, which survives discharge, allowing plaintiff's former counsel to recover 
attorney's fees out of the proceeds of any settlement or judgment due and owing. <a href="#7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Later appellate cases have refined the 
procedural application of this rule. Bandy v. Mt. Diablo Unified School Dist. <a href="#8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> held that the discharged attorney cannot 
intervene in the underlying cause of action in order to establish his lien interest in he anticipated recovery; he must maintain a 
separate action against the client to enforce any lien rights. Later the same year the decision in Siciliano v. Fireman's Fund Ins. 
Co. <a href="#9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> established the discharged attorney's right to enforce his lien against a judgment or settlement as an equitable assignee 
of the client's recovery to the extent of the fees and costs which are due to him. As a result of this case, the discharged 
attorney can obligate the defendant and his insurer in the underlying cause of action by giving actual notice of the attorney's lien 
to the potential equitable debtor. Normally this is accomplished by filing a notice of lien in the original action. Remedies for 
enforcement of the attorney&#185;s lien are not abrogated or changed by Fracasse. <a href="#10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Siciliano also suggests by way of dicta that discharged counsel has the right to obtain declaratory relief and restraining orders 
to prevent the disbursement of recovery proceeds until the quantum meruit claim is satisfied, thereby causing the successful 
plaintiff delay in realizing the immediate benefit of his or her award.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Criticism</strong></p>
<p>Fracasse subjects the client to the jeopardy of paying additional fees.</p>
<p>To the extent that such discharge is followed by the retention of another attorney, the client will in any event be required, out 
of any recovery, to pay the former attorney for the reasonable value of his services. Such payment, in addition to the fee 
charged by the second attorney, should certainly operate as a self-limiting factor on the number of attorneys so discharged. 
<a href="#11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p>In effect, the client who changes attorneys may ultimately pay inflated prices for basic legal services. This could happen in the 
situation where the first attorney is paid for the reasonable value of his services; the second attorney is also paid his 
agreed-upon fee, and perhaps, in addition, a third fee for defending the fee dispute.</p>
<p>The threat of such additional fees clearly inhibits the client from freely changing attorneys in a system where public policy 
dictates the interest of the client is always superior to that of the attorney. <a href="#12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Consequently, the client who does change 
attorneys is prejudiced by just that kind of &quot;undue restriction&quot; the Fracasse court ostensibly desired to prevent.</p>
<p>The present rule requires the original attorney to sue his former client--an action which is repugnant to our traditional concept 
of the attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p>There are also conflict of interest problems inherent in any action based on the former confidential relationship. Legally, that 
relationship does not end when the client dismisses his attorney; and attorneys and client would be equally distressed with any 
rule of law which requires counsel to sue clients for whom they were formerly obligated to provide their best talents, industry 
and confidence. Such litigation is destructive of the attorney-client relationship and increases the public's present wariness of 
the legal profession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the client-consumer normally has little to contribute to the thorny problem of determining the reasonable value of 
services performed by either attorney. The difficulty presented by this question is one of the reasons that the quantum meruit 
rule of damages remains a minority view in the country today, <a href="#13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and it was one of the reasons Justice Sullivan registered his 
dissent in Fracasse. The Fracasse majority cited Los Angeles v. Los Angeles-Inyo Farms Co. <a href="#14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> for the criteria to consider 
in determining a reasonable fee for the first attorney. They are:</p>
<p>(T)he nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the success or failure of the 
attorney&#185;s efforts, the attorney's skill and learning, including his age and experience in the particular type of work demanded. 
<a href="#15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>
<p>Other factors to be considered are: </p>
<ol>
<li>The novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</li>
<li>The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other 
employment by the lawyer.</li>
<li>The amount involved and the results obtained.</li>
<li>The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.</li>
<li>The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.</li>
<li>The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the service.</li>
<li>Whether the fee is fixed or contingent. </li>
<li>The time and labor required.</li>
</ol>
<p>A normal contingent fee case also presents further difficulties. It is not easily divisible as to the quality of time or labor 
performed by the attorneys. Often the most difficult and valuable services are rendered in uncovering the true nature of the 
underlying liability, securing evidence, locating experts and counseling the client before substantial discovery begins or 
appearances are made. </p>
<p><strong>A Proposal</strong></p>
<p>When attorneys cooperate on the transfer of a case in which the fee will be paid on a contingency basis, current custom 
requires the client pay only one fee from either settlement or judgment. Counsel usually agrees to apportion the fee based 
upon the work performed, and they obtain the consent of the client pursuant to Rule 2-108 of the Rules of Professional 
Responsibility. This practice facilitates easy discharge of an attorney by the dissatisfied client-consumer.</p>
<p>Regrettably, California law fails to require a similar result when transfer of a contingency fee case cannot be accomplished 
cooperatively. California law should recognize that a client who retains counsel on a contingency basis should be charged only 
one fee from the proceeds of he recovery. Both former and subsequent counsel should expect to satisfy their competing 
quantum meruit claims solely from that fee. Where they cannot agree upon an allocation, the lawyer concluding the case 
should be authorized to discharge the paying parties and their insurers, if any, and to disburse to the client his or her share. The 
balance then should be either temporarily allocated between the attorneys by agreement or held in trust pending a 
determination of the quantum meruit interest of each attorney in the fee. Either attorney would then be free to pursue the fee 
dispute with the other lawyer without burdening the client.</p>
<p>Such a rule would allow defendants and their insurance carriers to promptly pay settlements and awards to the prevailing party 
and would relieve courts from applications for equitable relief pending determinations concerning attorney&#185;s liens and related 
hearings by discharged former counsel.</p>
<p>This proposal would allow the consumer of legal service, who has an absolute right without the burdens and restrictions 
imposed by present law. This rule would operate more efficiently than the present rule by no longer involving the client, 
defendants and insurers in the fee resolution process, thereby resulting in benefits for these persons and the courts as well.</p>
<p>More importantly, it would focus the fee allocation dispute upon the attorneys who actually performed services at no 
additional cost to the client. Furthermore, it would institute a rule of fairness for the consumer: The consumer who retains a 
lawyer on a contingency basis should pay only one attorney's fee.</p>

</p>
<p>Children exposed in utero to low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] have suffered long-term brain damage, 
decreased learning skills, and low I.Q. scores according to a study of 212 eleven year olds whose mothers had elevated 
concentrations of PCBs as a result of eating Lake Michigan fish contaminated with the chemical. These mothers at birth had 
PCBs in the blood and breast milk that was slightly higher than in the general population as a result of having consumed 
approximately 12 pounds of Lake Michigan fish in the preceding six years.</p>
<p>This study raises serious issues for the children of women employed in the electrical industry who were exposed to PCBs in 
the manufacture of motors, transformers, switches and related electrical equipment. Oil with PCBs for many years was as a 
coolant and to dampen sparks because the product was long-lasting, had a high tolerance for heat and did not readily 
breakdown. It has been banned in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but industrial residues still persist in the environment and are 
a source of food contamination as they are taken up by plants that are eaten by fish. Once consumed by humans the PCBs are 
deposited and stored in fat, virtually permanently. Numerous studies have documented increased levels of PCBs in Great 
Lakes fish.</p>
<p>Risks associated with developmental delays have been well documented in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>In a previous study in North Carolina, Rogan, W. J. et al Polychlorinated Biphenyls [PCBs] and Dichlorodiphenyl 
Dichloroethene [DDE] in Human Milk: Effects of Maternal Factors and Previous Lactation, American Journal of Public Health 
1986, 76:172-7, scientists showed that fetal exposure to PCBs affected neural development in children. </p>
<p>An earlier study by Drs. Jacobson showed the cohort of 313 children had suffered adversely impacted postnatal growth and 
short-term memory deficits in infancy and at age 4. Jacobson, J.L. and Jacobson S. W. et al Effects in Utero Exposure to 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Related Contaminants on Cognitive Functioning in Young Children, Journal of Pediatrics 1990, 
116;38-45.</p>
<p>Similar results have been found in Chinese children exposed to mothers who had eaten rice oil that contained PCBs.</p>
<p>The present Wayne State study followed up the 313 children previously tested by Drs. Jacobson and re-tested 212 at age 
eleven. Of this group 167 were born to mothers who had consumed fish from Lake Michigan contaminated with PCBs. The 
children were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children I.Q. instrument, the Wide Range Achievement Test - 
Revised and portions of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests -Revised.</p>
<p>&quot;Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls was associated with significantly lower full-scale and verbal I.Q. scores. An 
analysis of covariance indicated that the effect was primarily in the most highly exposed children . . . . . prenatal exposure to 
polychlorinated biphenyls was associated wit poorer verbal comprehension and freedom from distractibility.&quot; At 786.</p>
<p>These findings corroborate earlier findings by Drs. Jacobson, as well as other researchers, and show that children whose 
mothers were exposed to PCBs during pregnancy will have decreased &quot;intellectual ability, short-term and long-term memory 
and focused and sustained attention,&quot; all of which are critically necessary for success in school. Although no children were 
found to have been mentally retarded, the loss of I.Q. in this group is sufficient to impact learning to read and general school 
performance. </p>
<p>Most significantly, children who had suffered the highest level of maternal exposure were three times as likely to have I.Q. 
scores that tested in the low normal range and twice as likely to have difficulty in learning to read.</p>
<p>Drs. Sandra and Joseph Jacobson have concluded that children exposed in utero to PCBs have the same disabilities as 
children exposed to low levels of lead. The full study is reported in the New England Journal of Medicine: Intellectual 
Impairment in Children Exposed to Polychlorinated Biphenyls In Utero, New England Journal of Medicine, September 12, 
1996, 335:783.</p>

<h3>Children Harmed By Solvents During Pregnancy</h3>

<hr>

<p>Children who have been injured as a result of the negligent conduct of employers who expose pregnant mothers to hazards in 
the workplace are now entitled to bring a direct action against the mother's employer in California as a result of a long prayed 
for September 25, 1996 decision of the California Court of Appeal in Mikala Snyder v. Michael's Stores, Inc.</p>
<p>This decision expressly holds that an earlier California case that has precluded injured children from seeking relief in California 
courts since 1989, Bell v. Macy 212 Cal. App. 3d 1442, was incorrectly decided.</p>
<p>In a related article involving in utero exposure to methyl ethyl ketone which resulted in microcephaly we explain our analysis 
and approach to proof in one case arising from an exposure suffered by a pregnant woman and her fetus to solvents in an 
electronics industry &quot;clean room.&quot; In that case we successfully pursued a &quot;third party&quot; action against a solvent manufacturer on 
behalf of the brain damaged child, having been precluded from suing the employer under the draconian reasoning of the Bell 
case. See <a href="utero.shtml">Methyl Ethyl Ketone, Fetal Neurotoxicity, Microcephaly and Mental Retardation: In Utero Brain Damage Caused 
by Toxic Solvent Exposure</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com/txt/article/utero.shtml].</p>
<p>Bell held that a child's claim for personal injuries as a result of an in utero poisoning or developmentally damaging exposure 
was barred by the &quot;exclusive remedy&quot; provisions of California Labor Code section 3600 and 3602. The Snyder Court had no 
difficulty determining that a child in the womb was not an employee and that any injury inflicted upon a child by the mother&#185;s 
employer is actionable to the same extent as any nonemployee's direct injury by the employer.</p>
<p>In Snyder, Mikala's mother was employed by Michael&#185;s Stores in Modesto. During Naomi&#185;s employment the store permitted 
a buffing machine powered by propane gas to be used in the store without adequate ventilation and monitoring, even though 
management had been informed that a toxic level of carbon monoxide gas was accumulating in the store during the use of the 
buffer.. On one afternoon the CO reached such a high level that 21 customers and employees were taken to hospitals, 
including Naomi. All were diagnosed with carbon monoxide poisoning. </p>
<p>CO binds to hemoglobin and reduces the capacity of the blood to transport oxygen and poisons a variety of intracellular 
mechanisms, further impairing cellular respiration. In Mikala's case the deprivation of oxygen resulted in permanent damage to 
her brain and as a result she suffers from cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, abnormal motor function and other serious 
conditions.</p>
<p>California law provides, Civil Code section 1714, that everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his willful acts, but 
also for an injury occasioned to another by a want of ordinary care in the management of his person or property. In other 
words, negligent acts will be held liable. </p>
<p>In contrast the rules are much different for an employee who is injured at work. Under California Labor Code section 3600, 
an employer's liability is without regard to negligence and the sole and exclusive remedy for an on-the-job injury to an 
employee is controlled by the workers&#185; compensation system's schedule of benefits. The concept is that both employer and 
employee give up certain rights. The employer becomes liable notwithstanding whether or not the employer is at fault and if the 
injury is work related the workers' compensation system is the only available avenue for relief, including any derivative claims 
of family members, such as lost consortium, loss of support and emotional distress. It is a system without fault, but with 
severely limited damages and in some cases recoveries are precluded for certain injuries that are real but unrelated to one&#185;s 
ability to work, as victims of on-the-job castration or penile injury have learned to their gross dismay. The Bell decision was 
particularly mean-spirited because California's workers' compensation system has no provision of injuries to children, basically 
because they are not related to workplace productivity.</p>
<p>Over 40 states permit an action in tort for prenatal injuries to a child and even California law provides that an unborn child is 
&quot;deemed an existing person, so far as necessary for the child&#185;s interests in the event of the child's subsequent birth.&quot; Civil Code 
section 43.1.</p>
<p>California adopted a minority position with regard to the claims of children injure in utero in the Bell case where a company 
nurse misdiagnosed abdominal discomfort as gas when it fact it was a ruptured uterus. The child suffered brain damage and 
dies at the age of 28 months. The court held in Bell that since the injury was a direct result of Macy's work-related negligence 
it was include within the workers' compensation system of claims. But, the workers' compensation system has never provided 
any benefits for injured children. In short the court created a right which provides no remedy and withdrew a right that did. 
Clearly a mean decision by judges who care not that the victim and his or her family would be condemned to a life of injury 
and mandatory provision of care. That the California Supreme Court would allow such a decision to stand is beyond belief, 
especially in light of California's statutory policy that in utero injuries suffered by a child born alive shall be compensated in the 
same manner as injuries to a living person. Civil Code section 43.1.</p>
<p>Wisely the justices deciding Snyder conclude that the decision in Bell &quot;stretches the exclusivity rule beyond any reasonable 
bounds intended&quot; and held that the bargained exchange of rights in the workers compensation system is &quot;limited, however, to 
he consequences of injuries to the employee.&quot;</p>
<p>The practical impact of Bell was to confer virtual immunity on employers from claims of injured children and allowed 
employers to act negligently towards the unborn children of pregnant employees. </p>
<p>The wisdom of Justices Vartabdian, Thaxter, and Stone is indeed commendable. On behalf of a grateful parents of injured and 
handicapped children, &quot;thank you&quot; to his court for recognizing the plight of their children and families and for providing an 
avenue for relief.</p>

<p><a name="1"><strong>1. Internet Sources of Government Information, 2nd Edition, February 26, 1994, By Blake Gumprecht, 
Documents Librarian, Temple University</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a><strong> (back top)</strong></p>
<p>Internet users can now access hundreds of sources of current government information from around the world -- Census data, 
Supreme Court decisions, world health statistics, company financial reports, weather forecasts, United Nations information, 
daily White House press briefings and much more. The Internet has become a rich resource for government information, in 
part because works produced by many government agencies are not eligible for copyright protection. </p>
<p>So, while government agencies have been criticized for not making more information available online, enterprising individuals 
and organizations have themselves made a wealth of sources available via the network. A growing number of government 
agencies too are beginning to establish systems that can be accessed remotely. You can now e-mail the President, and 
enactment by Congress last year of the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Improvement Act assures 
the U.S. government's role in distributing information electronically will increase. A variety of other proposals suggest that in 
the future, more and more information produced by state, local and international governmental organizations will also be 
available online, sometimes exclusively. </p>
<p>In many cases, there are significant advantages to the sources accessible online over what can be found in the library or via 
other means. Internet resources are often more up-to-date than their paper counterparts. Frequently they can be searched by 
keyword. Sometimes they provide information simply not available in more traditional formats. A word of warning is 
necessary, though. Internet resources are constantly changing. What is available one minute may not be available the next. 
System addresses, source directories and file names are often changed without notice. Sometimes a remote system may be 
temporarily unavailable. </p>
<p>This is the second edition of a guide to Internet sources of government information originally created for the students, faculty 
and staff of Temple University. The second edition includes more than 325 sources, two-thirds of which were not listed in the 
first edition. The sources listed are intended to provide the simplest and clearest route known to the information described. 
The preferred source is often a Gopher source because of the ease of using the Gopher software. Often, however, there are 
several sources for the same information. Some may allow more sophisticated file manipulation. Frequently files can be 
downloaded to your personal computer using a feature known as file transfer protocol (FTP). </p>
<p>When the source listed is a Gopher source, the instructions assume users can escape the local Gopher menu structure to 
connect directly to a remote Gopher. This can normally be done by issuing the Gopher command in combination with a 
remote system address from your system's ready prompt. Contact your local systems administrator if this doesn't work. Many 
files accessible via Gopher are also available using a Telnet command, but don't assume a Gopher source can be accessed via 
Telnet. Telnet sources usually require an account or password and are sometimes not intended for outside use. </p>
<p>The second edition of this guide includes a few changes from the first. Because the new edition features many more sources 
than the first, sources in this edition are arranged by subject rather than alphabetically. Each source is listed in only one subject 
category. Sources that include information about a wide variety of subjects are usually included in one of three general 
categories that begin the list. Additional access points have also been added for many sources. Often in the first edition only a 
single access point was provided,typically a Gopher source. I now realize some Internet users do not have direct Gopher 
access, so I have supplied Telnet addresses when known. Instructions for retrieving files via FTP are generally not provided 
unless the information is otherwise unavailable. System addresses, source directories and file names for all sources have been 
verified at least twice. I have added in parenthesis the date I last accessed the source using the information provided. </p>
<p>The &quot;path&quot; listed is the &quot;address&quot; of the remote computer system where the information described can be found, along with the 
steps a user must take to locate the particular directory or file that contains the information. Slashes in the path separate 
commands, steps, or levels in a menu or file hierarchy. The first part of any path is a command statement that must be 
executed to access the remote source of the information. Type the first part of the path, up to any slashes, and press the Enter 
key. If there are no slashes, type the entire phrase. </p>
<p>I would like to thank Terese Austin, Maggie Parhamovich, Joe Ryan and Kim Tsang, whose guides helped me improve the 
quality of my own. I am indebted as well to the ever-helpful participants of the GOVDOC-L electronic discussion group, 
without whom this guide would not be possible. I'd also like to thank Calvin Boyer, whose U.S. Government Gophers 
gateway proved useful, and contributors to Gleason Sackman's Net-Happenings list, an important source of information about 
new network resources. Thanks to Larry Detweiler, Louis Rosenfeld, Mike Showalter and others too numerous to name who 
have helped make my guide more widely available. And thanks to all who have had kind words. </p>
<p>Current and future editions of this guide can be retrieved via Gopher, anonymous FTP and e-mail. The guide can be obtained 
via Gopher or FTP from the University of Michigan's Clearinghouse of Subject-Oriented Internet Resource Guides... </p>

<hr>

Across California juries are relied upon to determine the adequacy of warnings in cases involving claims that a product was 
defective. Whether a warning is adequate requires a weighing of all the factual circumstances against multiple criteria, none of which is 
totally controlling. Cavers v. Cushman (1979),95 Cal.App.3d 336, 157 Cal.Rptr. 142, one of the leading cases concerning 
warnings in the products liability field, is an excellent example of the factual balancing a jury must undertake.Cavers involved a motorized golf cart that rolled over causing injuries. The court instructed the jury that an otherwise 
faultlessly made article may be deemed defective if the manufacturer, fails to warn of dangerous propensities ... which in the 
absence of an adequate warning render the article substantially dangerous to the user.... Whether a danger is substantial or 
insubstantial must be determined from the evidence and measured in the light of several criteria none of which is totally 
controlling including the potential injurious consequences of such danger, the likelihood that injury might result, the quality and 
extent of danger to which the user is exposed and whether a danger is latent or patent .... (Id., at p 349.)Cavers is a good statement of California law because it summarizes into one standard forty years of decisional law on various 
types of products. Forty years ago in Tingley v. E. F. Houghton (1947) 30 Cal.2d 97, 179 P.2d 807, the jury was called upon to determine the 
adequacy of a limited warning that did not warn that contaminated chemicals could result in an unexpected explosion. The 
Supreme Court held, in affirming verdicts for the plaintiffs, that &quot;the jury nevertheless could have found that ... the resulting 
explosion was a direct consequence of defendant's negligence in failing to give an adequate warning of the dangerous nature of 
his products.&quot; Id., at p.811.Case after case since that time has reaffirmed the role of the jury in making a factual determination whether a given warning is 
adequate, appropriate, suitable or sufficient under the specific facts of a given case. The same should also be true after 
passage of Section 1714.45. Those cases in which the trial court has found for the manufacturer by granting a motion for 
summary judgment, judgment n.o.v., or a nonsuit are uniformly reversed, as the following products liability warning cases 
show.Gall v. Union Ice Co. (1952) 108 Cal.App. 303, 230 P.2d 48 involved the absence of sufficient warning labels on drums of 
sulfuric acid which exploded. Affirming verdicts for the plaintiffs, the court held that the question of defendants chemical 
companies' negligence in failing to place proper warning labels on sulfuric acid drums were for the jury.A theatrical smoke-producing device set fire to a child's dress in Laramendy v. Myers (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 636, 272 
P.2d 824. &quot;The written directions which were with the device when it was received, warned: to hold the device away from the 
face while filling the hole with powder; and to stand back without making contact (when the device is on the floor) so that 
'puff' will not strike face.&quot; Notwithstanding these warnings the court found the warning was incomplete, affirmed a verdict for<br>
plaintiff, and held that the &quot;defendants neglected to reasonably warn of the dangerous propensities of the device. There was no 
warning of danger from fire.&quot; Id., at p.639.In Crane v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 855,32 Cal.Rptr. 754, an inflammable mixture used to prepare 
surfaces for painting was ignited by a water heater. Among other things the label provided: &quot;Caution: Inflammable mixture. Do 
not use near fire or flame... Contains more that 15% Benzol-Beware of Poisonous Fumes.&quot; Id., at p.856. In affirming a 
judgment for the plaintiff the court found the warning incomplete and stated: &quot;The label cautioned that the surface preparer was 
an inflammable mixture, not to be used near fire or flame, and to beware of poisonous fumes. It did not say that the mixture 
was combustible or explosive.&quot; Id., at p.856. Because of the limited warning, the court held that it is a question of fact whether 
the label gave appropriate warning.... In view of the latent, dangerous qualities of the surface preparer herein involved, 
Universal, as manufacturer, had an independent duty of determining that adequate warning was given to the public with 
respect to its use. The facts herein presented a question for the jury to determine whether this was done. (Ibid.)In 1966 a judgment of nonsuit was reversed in Gherna v. Ford Motor Company (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 639, 55 Cal.Rptr. 
94, a negligence action arising from a fire that destroyed a new Thunderbird. Ford knew of the danger of fire resulting from 
transmission fluid contacting the exhaust manifold, but &quot;did not include a warning as to such dangers in its handbook, or 
otherwise, except for the admonition against rocking the car when stuck in sand or snow.&quot; Id., at p.651. The court held the 
question of negligent failure to warn &quot;should have been submit to the jury under appropriate instructions.&quot; Ibid.Toole v. Richardson (1967) Cal.App.2d 689, 710, 60 Cal.Rptr. 398 involves the infamous MER/29. In affirming a jury 
verdict for the plaintiff&#185;s eye damage as a result of inadequate warnings given with this prescription drug, Justice Salsman 
found there was substantial evidence to support the jury&#185;s verdict and award of punitive damages. On the strict liability 
question the court stated:The possibility of eye injury and age was known to appellant before product was placed on the market yet no warning of this 
danger was given until the weight of accumulating evidence and the insistence of the FDA compelled it. Thus strict liability 
justified on the ground that the product was marketed without proper warning of its known dangerous effect. (Id., p.710.)&quot;Questions of fact were presented with respect to the issue whether the manufacturer should have known that the general 
instructions to use a lubricant were more respected in the breach than by observance, and, if so, whether special warnings 
should have been given of the particular hazard from safety rims,&quot; was the holding in Casetta v. United States Rubber (1968), 
260 Cal.App.2d 792, 816, Cal.Rptr. 64 5, 661. The court reversed a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this tire 
mounting explosion case. Although the manufacturer knew that a special hazard arose in mounting tube-type tires on safety or 
hump-type rims, the evidence was in dispute on the extent to which warnings &quot;were communicated to the plaintiff himself.&quot; 
Ibid. &quot;There was substantial evidence to support a finding for the plaintiff on the foregoing issues, and it was error to withdraw 
them from consideration of the jury.&quot; Id., at p.817.Midgeley v. S.S. Kresge Company (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 67, 127 Cal.Rptr.217, reversed a jury verdict for a supplier in a 
case where a telescope was sold without proper warnings. Justice Pug found the warnings to be incomplete: Thus a product requiring . . . use in conformity with the supplier's directions is defective if the supplier fails to warn adequately 
of conditions and circumstances created by such ...which would render the product dangerous to the user. Therefore,the 
supplier is strictly liable for injuries proximately resulting from composing and furnishing a set of instructions for .... use which 
does not adequately avoid the danger of injury. It follows that plaintiff was entitled to jury consideration of the adequacy of the 
instructions for assembly and use of the telescope in the context of strict liability.&quot; (Id., at p.74.)In cases where the manufacturer knows that the product sold is dangerous, &quot;even though the circumstances under which the 
danger may occur are limited in number compared to the total number of uses of the product, the manufacturer is liable if he 
fails to warn of the latent defect.&quot; John Norton Farms v. Todagco (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 149, 175, 177 Cal.Rptr.215, 228; 
Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. v. Superior Court (1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 157, 162. The plaintiff in this case offered proof that 
defendants knew that using a chemical could result in limited, specific harm for which they did not warn. The court of appeal 
reversed a nonsuit and found that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case on his cause of action for negligent failure to 
warn.In failure to warn cases, where a warning label has been affixed to the product, defendants routinely claim that under Temple 
v. Velcro USA, Inc. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 1090, 196 Cal.Rptr. 531, a court can, as a matter of law, find that the warning 
is adequate and take the issue from the jury on a summary judgment.Temple arose under very unusual facts where consumers were directly warned by mail that the product in question was 
dangerous and was being taken off the market. When Velcro learned that its product was being used for an unintended use in 
hot air balloons, it wrote all hot air balloonists:Velcro closure has not been designed and is not proper for use to secure the deflation panels in hot air balloons. Any balloon 
which uses Velcro closure for this purpose is unsafe ... could cause uncontrollable descent and serious injury or death ... 
Velcro is immediately ceasing sales of Velcro closures for sale in hot air balloons ... do not fly any hot air balloon which uses 
Velcro closures ... Velcro ... is not responsible for loss or injury caused by the use of its product in this manner. Individuals 
who ignore this warning do so at their own risk and may suffer serious injury or death ... The use of Velcro in this manner is 
extremely dangerous and you must notify any hot air balloon under any circumstances unless and until it has been retrofitted 
with a deflation plane which does not employ or rely on Velcro closures to hold it in place.In Temple, the plaintiff admitted having received the warnings, &quot;but we didn't pay any attention to it.&quot; Id., at p. 1092. Under 
such facts, it is understandable why the order granting summary judgment was affirmed.Notwithstanding the unique facts in the Temple decision, the issue of adequacy of a warning is routinely a question of fact for 
the jury.<hr>

<p><font size=5>S</font>eatbelts save lives and those know firsthand the risks of high speed automobile collisions always &quot;buckle up.&quot; Rarely will you 
find highway patrol personnel, ambulance drivers, emergency room doctors, trial lawyers or professional racing drivers not 
wearing a seat belt. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>espite the reliability of manual seatbelts, under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, automobile manufacturers have 
been authorized to introduce passive restraints or so-called &quot;automatic seatbelts.&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>ith the 1995 increase in highway speeds from 55 to 65 mph, the severity of collisions will be enhanced substantially and the 
reliability of passive systems will be tested, unfortunately on real subjects. Even though the increased speeds appear nominal, the 
energy available in a crash increases in proportion to the square of the speed. For example the increased energy presented by a 
speed increase from 30 to 60 miles per hour is four times greater at the higher speed [30 x 30 v. 60 x 60 = 900 v. 3600]. At 
regular highway speeds an increase in speed by 15 mph from 55 to 70 mph represents a 50% increase in available energy. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>ncreased energy means that vehicles must now absorb more energy in crashes in order to allow for safe deceleration of 
passengers. Door latches and seat belt systems must remain secure despite higher levels of energy. Higher energy also results in 
more rollovers and there lies the real hazard. Understanding the dynamics of highway collisions and the less effective role of 
passive restraint systems at higher speeds is critical for an understanding of the limits of these systems. </p>
<p><font size=5>P</font>assive belt systems include door-mounted belts and motorized shoulder restraints that can induce a false sense of security in 
drivers and front seat passengers. Because of this serious deficiency they do not have the greater reliability of manual 
shoulder/lap belt systems. </p>
<p><font size=5>G</font>eneral Motors Corporation has been the leader in offering door-mounted belts. The lap belt is secured to the lower door and 
the shoulder restraint is attached to the upper door. Upon opening, both belts move forward and away from the seat to allow 
entry and egress. When the door is closed, both are intended to hold the passenger in place for crash protection, providing the 
door are fully secured and the latches hold tight. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>oor-mounted belts often contain excess slack and because they are loose they do not provided needed restraint. In an 
otherwise survivable collision, a loose belt can result in head contact with the windshield header or the roof, causing brain 
damage or spinal cord lesions. </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>otorized shoulder restraints require active latching of a lap belt which often is unsecured because of misplaced confidence in 
the role of the automatic shoulder belt. Testing of Japanese cars showed that drivers readily and routinely forget to latch the lap 
belt. On impact the occupant &quot;submarines&quot; the belt and the g load on the body is focused on the neck as it contacts the belt. </p>
<p><font size=5>G</font>eneral Motors fuel system crash tests mandated by the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration, show that GM 
type III or modified type III door latches will release in moderate to severe impacts and doors will open, releasing the occupants 
from passive belts. This is especially critical in a rollover, where ejection readily results in brain or spinal cord damage, 
amputations or death. The same is true in motorized shoulder restraint systems in which the absence of a lap belt and an open 
door is the cause for ejection. The best protection against injury in a rollover is to be securely belted inside the passenger 
compartment. Passive systems only work as well as the door latching system and do not provide the same level of protection as 
manually latched belts. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>ir bags can and will open unexpectedly, fail to open in a crash, cause skin burns and severely aggravate pre-existing hearing 
losses due to the discharge of the explosive charge that inflates the bag. Sensor switches are located aft of the front bumper in the 
frame itself and in the rear of the engine compartment's firewall, forward of the passenger compartment. Air bags inflators are 
designed to explode when two sensors are decelerated in the equivalent to a moderate [15 mph] crash into a wall, and the force 
emanates from within a 30&#154; angle of center. As a result steering wheel and dash air bags will not deploy in every collision. </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>ith the advent of chest level air bags preventing forward induced injuries to head, neck and chest, the need for lower leg and 
side protection has become evident. In addition, in cases where air bags have deployed, visible facial, head and chest injuries 
have now been replaced by delayed deceleration injuries which do not present until hours after the crash. </p>
<p><font size=5>P</font>assive seatbelt safety systems and air bags are subject to failure in readily foreseeable crashes and often times will fail due to 
factors beyond a driver's or passenger's control. Securely latched doors and the of use of lap belts in motorized shoulder 
restraint systems will result in increased safety. </p>

<hr>

<p>Under the modern view expressed by a majority of jurisdictions, including California, the effect of anticipated inflation is a 
proper factor to be considered by the jury in arriving at an award for damages for future losses. As early as 1948, California 
law approved consideration of inflation as a matter of economic reality. In Kircher v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. (1948) 32 
Cal.2d 176, 187, the Court stated: It is a matter of common knowledge, and of which judicial notice may be taken, that the 
purchasing power of the dollar has decreased to approximately one-half what it was prior to the present inflationary spiral 
[citations omitted], and the trier of facts should take this factor into consideration in determining the amount of damages 
necessary to compensate an injured person for the loss sustained as a result of the injuries suffered. See also Burke v. City 
and County of San Francisco (1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 314, 321-322.</p>
<p>In Miles v. City of San Rafael (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 230, 243, the court upheld a verdict of $4,025,000 for an 11-year old 
disabled boy and rejected the defendant's argument that the inflation rates were too high. The court stated that anticipated 
future increases in medical expenses may be considered by the jury and that expert testimony may be used with regard to a 
&quot;subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact,&quot; citing 
Evidence Code section 801.</p>
<p>Also, in Rodriguez v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1978) 87 Cal. App.3d 626, 662, the Court rejected the defendant's 
argument that in making the award it was improper for the jury to take into account inflationary trends. The court noted that 
California law has long approved consideration of the factor of inflation as a matter of economic reality. In United States v. 
English 521 F.2d 63 (9th Cir. 1975), the court, applying California law, recognized the propriety of considering future inflation 
in awarding damages, stating: &quot;We hold that a trier of fact may take into account future estimates of changes in the purchasing 
power of money in arriving at a damage award under California law.&quot; The Court cautioned that the estimate of future inflation 
must be supported by sound and substantial economic evidence. Id., at pp. 74-76. The correctness of this decision was 
recognized by the United States Supreme Court in Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer (1983) 462 U.S. 523, 541; 76 
L.Ed. 2d 768; 103 S. Ct. 2541. </p>
<p>Similarly, United States v. English, supra, was followed and approved in Sauers v. Alaska Barge, 600 F.2d 238, 244-246, 
(9th Cir. 1979), which held that the district court erred in refusing to adjust an award to reflect the impact of future inflation in 
view of the sound and substantial evidence presented by the plaintiff pertaining to the impact of inflation.</p>
<p>In Maheu v. Hughes Tool Co. 569 F.2d 459, 477 (9th Cir. 1977), a diversity action under California law, an estimate of 
future inflationary trends was taken into account when computing future lost earnings.</p>
<p>The need to consider the effect of inflation on damage awards also was noted in Vesey v. United States 626 F.2d 627, 
631-632, (9th Cir. 1980) where the court recognized that an inflation factor can increase the award of damages in a wrongful 
death action. The decision, however, was based upon plaintiff's failure to connect offered evidence that related to inflationary 
trends to the expected erosion of the decedent's future earning capacity. I.e., the plaintiff failed to meet the requirements set 
forth in United States v. English, supra, which requires that the trier of fact, in awarding damages, only consider estimates of 
future changes and the purchasing power of money which are based on sound and substantial economic evidence. Other 
Ninth Circuit cases recognizing that anticipated inflation is a proper factor to be considered by the trier of fact in determining 
the amount of future losses are Alma v. Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Co. 684 F.2d 622 (9th Cir. 1982); Shaw v. United 
States 741 F.2d 1202 (9th Gir. 1984); and Hollinger v. United States 651 F.2d 636 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys should always present expert economic testimony concerning inflation and request that the jury be 
instructed that inflation is a proper factor to be considered in determining the amount of damages for future loss before 
reducing future losses to present value.</p>

<h3 align=left>Recall of Gerry Baby Monitors</h3>
<p align=left>On October 4, 1996, Gerry Baby Products Company, of Thornton, Colo., is announcing a voluntary recall of approximately 
990,000 Model 602 Gerry Deluxe Baby Monitors. Wires inside the monitor may be improperly connected, resulting in the 
product overheating with the possibility of the monitor causing fire. Another contributing factor is when blankets or other 
bedding are placed around or on top of the monitor blocking ventilation. </p>
<p align=left>Parents should not place any monitor in the crib, among blankets or bedding, or in any position that interferes with ventilation 
for the monitor.The company is aware of one fire without injuries involving a Model 602 monitor with this manufacturing error. 
The two-piece monitor sets resemble walkie-talkies. The monitors have pale gray and royal blue plastic casing. A red &quot;on&quot; 
light and a blue &quot;Gerry&quot; label appear on the front of each monitor. The back of the monitors are embossed with &quot;GERRY 
DELUXE BABY MONITOR MODEL 602&quot; and the manufacturer's date code. The date code appears as a circle of 
numbers, with an arrow pointing to the number of the month and the two-digit year number on either side of the arrow. This 
recall involves monitors with date codes &quot;8806&quot; (June 1988) through &quot;9005&quot; (May 1990). </p>
<p align=left>Juvenile product and baby supply stores and department stores sold the recalled monitors nationwide from June 1988 through 
May 1990. The monitors were packaged in blue cardboard boxes labeled in part, &quot;Gerry Deluxe Baby Monitor...Listen to 
Your Baby from any Home Location...Gerry Baby Safetronics...&quot; </p>
<p align=left>Families who own Model 602 monitors should contact Gerry toll-free at (800) 672-6289 for instructions on how to return the 
recalled monitors for a free replacement monitor. </p>

<h3 align=left>Recall of Toro Tractors</h3>
<p align=left>The Toro Company of Bloomington, Minn., is recalling approximately 6,500 TORO Wheel Horse 
Yard and Garden Tractors as well as Ford and New Holland brand LS 25 and LS 45 Gear Yard 
Tractors. The tractors' brakes may wear out prematurely, eventually leading to brake failure. As a 
result, consumers could be injured if they lose control of the tractors. </p>
<p align=left>Toro has received reports of two consumers who each broke a foot after losing control of their 
tractors. </p>
<p align=left>This recall and repair program affects TORO model 72040 tractors with serial numbers ranging 
from 4900001 to 5999999; Ford or New Holland model LS 25 Gear tractors with serial numbers 
from T4A0001 to T4A1201, and T5A0001 to T5A0617; and Ford or New Holland model LS 45 
Gear tractors with serial numbers from T4C0001 to T4C0581, and from T5C0001 to T5C0168. 
The model and serial numbers are located on the fender underneath the seat. </p>
<p align=left>TORO and New Holland dealers sold the six-speed riding tractors nationwide under the names 
&quot;TORO,&quot; &quot;Ford,&quot; and &quot;New Holland&quot; from January 1994 to May 1996 for about $2,000 each.</p>
<p align=left>Consumers who own recalled TORO tractors should contact the nearest TORO Service Dealer to 
have the brakes modified at no charge. For information on how to locate a TORO Service Dealer 
or for more information about this recall, consumers should call Toro at (800) 348-2424 from 7:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Central Time.</p>
<p align=left>Consumers who own recalled Ford or New Holland brand LS 25 or LS 45 Gear tractors should 
contact the nearest New Holland Service Dealer. For information on how to contact a New Holland 
Dealer, consumers should consult the owners assistance page in their operators manual for the name 
or number of their closest New Holland branch. If the manual has been misplaced, consumers 
should look in the yellow pages under &quot;Tractors&quot; for the nearest New Holland dealer. </p>
<p align=left>This recall involves tractors purchased before May 1996. The brakes on tractors purchased after 
May 1996 were modified prior to sale. Consumers who are unsure whether their tractor was 
modified should contact the nearest appropriate brand dealer for a free inspection.</p>

<H3>Gerber Recalls Flip Fingers Rattle</H3>

Gerber Products Co. of Fremont, Mich., is voluntarily recalling approximately 60,000 Flip Fingers Rattles in one style. The spherical end-caps of the rattle may separate releasing small parts, such as spinning pieces and noise-making beads, which present a choking and inhalation hazard to young children. Consumers should take the rattles away from children immediately and call Gerber at (800) 4-GERBER. Gerber will send consumers mailing materials and instructions for returning the rattles to the company to receive a refund. For more information, consumers should call (800) 4-GERBER.<P>

<h2>Chemical Exposure and Disease: </h2>
<h3>The Professional and Layperson's Guide to Understanding Cause and 
Effect. </h3>
<h3>Review by Richard Alexander </h3>
<p><hr><p><font size=-1>

</p>
<p>Written by a physician-toxicologist after examining some 8000 patients over a 25 year span, 
Chemical Exposure and Disease is a must for every person asking the question, &quot;Why?&quot; Why did 
I get sick? Why is the cancer rate so high? Why was this child born with birth defects? </p>
<p><strong>Chemical Exposure and Disease</strong> by Janette D. Sherman, M.D., provides investigative and 
diagnostic techniques for the medical, legal and lay communities in an easy-to-read manner. The 
book gives case-reports for all body systems, from the central nervous system, pulmonary, 
gastro-intestinal to reproductive. The book covers inherently dangerous industries, including 
asbestos, plastics, construction, paints, automotive, and waste disposal. </p>
<p>Pesticides are reviewed in depth, explaining the toxicology and giving valuable case reports. 
Examples of chemicals that cause endocrine-disruption, immunological dysfunction, neurological 
damage, cancer, and birth defects are discussed. </p>
<p>Extensive bibliographic sources are provided, including historical references, dispelling the notion 
that &quot;more studies are needed&quot; before we can take action. Chemical Exposure and Disease is a 
must for medical and legal professionals, as well as consumers who want corrective action and 
prevention steps taken now. </p>

<h2>BREAST IMPLANTS: Dow's Manipulation of Public Opinion and the 
Media </h2>
<hr>
<p>The following document was obtained in discovery in breast implant litigation. It contains a detailed proposal by 
Burson-Marsteller Public Relations of October 14, 1991 outlining Dow's public relations efforts prior to anticipated FDA 
hearings on the safety of breast implants.</p>
<p><em><strong>BURSON-MARSTELLER PUBLIC RELATIONS	October 14, 1991</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>PRE-FDA HEARING MEDIA PLAN</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secure maximum exposure for key positive messages, primarily:<p>	--	Breast implants are safe<br>
	--	Women need and value them<br>
	--	Each woman has a right to make her own informed decision</p>
</li>
<li>Stimulate general public to contact Congress and the FDA</li>
<li>Establish fair media climate for advisory panel hearing</li>
<li>Lay groundwork for additional stories at time of hearing </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Women and the general public</li>
<li>Washington opinion leaders</li>
<li>The media itself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use existing doctor and patient spokespersons wherever possible</li>
<li>Work with patient support groups, tying in to their activities</li>
<li>Keep trying to obtain celebrity spokesperson(s) for work with high-profile broadcast media</li>
<li>Utilize Dow Corning events as pertinent</li>
<li>Follow up with cadre of patients who handled fly-in (or encourage ASPRS to do so), to stimulate further activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>PHASE 1 -- NOW UNTIL END OF OCTOBER</strong></em></p>
<p>Stories on individual patients and doctors who have sympathetic perspectives</p>
<p>Trained patient spokespersons</p>
<ul>
<li>See attached appendix on patient spokespersons from San Francisco, Atlanta and Los Angeles, already trained.</li>
<li>Activities now beginning with patient spokespersons from Tampa, Miami and Washington, D.C., already trained. 
Training being held this week with patients from Houston, Dallas, Baltimore and Chicago.</li>
<li>B-M offering media support to each spokesperson in her local market.</li>
<li>Most successful/assured spokespersons to be offered to national media and as part of editorial board briefings 
(see) </li>
</ul>
<p>Trained physician spokespersons</p>
<ul>
<li>Eleven surgeons already trained during ASPRS convention in Seattle.</li>
<li>B-M/Dow Corning is sending them periodic mailings to stimulate activity.</li>
<li>No word as yet from ASPRS on their actual activity (forms to be sent to ASPRS).</li>
<li>B-M/Dow Corning willing to provide additional training to doctors, either to expand local market reach or to 
prepare some doctors for national media work.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>--	Dow Corning needs input from Dr. Cole regarding key oncologists and other specialists who should be 
&quot;on call&quot; -- can this be arranged?</p>
<p>--	B-M recommends that ASPRS continue to pepper doctors and patients from &quot;fly-in&quot; with mailings 
designed to stimulate their letters, speeches, media activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Work to set up hearings by Congressional Women's Caucus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>B-M to contact office of Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-OH) ASAP to try to stimulate this.</li>
<li>Depending on specifics, B-M will follow up to develop media approach, including Washington-based press 
conference the week of the hearings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contact top medial columnists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>B-M drafting letter asking columnist to inform readers about danger that FDA may be pressured to ban implants</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	Letter to be sent by trained patient spokesperson(s), depending on where newspaper etc. is located.</p>
<p>	--	Selected spokesperson also to send letter to national health writers, such as Jane Brody of NEW 
YORK TIMES, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Letter also asks columnist for presentation of balanced view of risks/benefits to reassure those with implants, 
override media hysteria.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>--	Send the columnist a copy of the FDA's own background on implants as source material. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Contact top national issues columnists with information on women's rights issue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Letter from selected patient spokesperson to key columnists such as Anna Quindlen, James Kilpatrick.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional story ideas</strong></p>
<p>Basic governing idea of most stories:  many patients and doctors are very concerned and upset that the FDA is being 
pressured to ban implants by Cong. Ted Weiss and others.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The first implant patient, Timmy Jean Lindsey of Houston, is still active and a strong advocate of implants' benefits 
and a woman's right to choose.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>--	B-M to pitch Houston papers, wire services, national women's media</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feature: The nation's first woman plastic surgeon, 78-year old Alma Morani of Philadelphia, served Grace Kelly's 
family. Now retired, she strongly supports the endangered breast implant and a woman's right to choose.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M to pitch to Philadelphia media, national media.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feature:  Two Chicago plastic surgeons were motivated to help women recover from breast cancer via 
reconstruction after both their mothers died of breast cancer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M to pitch to Chicago newspapers, especially for possible syndication by TRIBUNE.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feature: The doctor who &quot;wrote the book&quot; on breast reconstruction, Bob Goldwyn of Harvard, is angry over 
misguided political attempts to ban breast implants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M to contact national print media, Boston area newspapers.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>News item:  Survey work by medical publisher Karen Berger shows that the vast majority of breast cancer patients 
who have been reconstructed find implants very valuable.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	K. Berger is considering how this might be used for news value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	If she agrees, B-M will pitch story to wire services.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>News item: National survey of women being commissioned to determine support for woman's right to make an 
informed decision.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M setting up survey, will craft results into wire service story.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Y-Me, which started out as a low-key support group for breast cancer patients, has become active on 
Capitol Hill, seeking funding for cancer research and maintenance of a woman's right to choose breast implants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M will work with Pam DeLuca, president of Y-Me, to approach Chicago media (e.g., Mary Ann 
Childers of ABC-TV affiliate) and possibly national media.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>B-M to work with My Image after Breast Cancer, local Washington, D.C. breast cancer support group affiliated 
with Y-Me, to generate all possible media coverage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>--	Pitch Washington women's/health care media on October 19 talk by Dr. Susan B. Love at Bethesda 
Naval Hospital (talk sponsored by My Image).</p>
<p>--	Investigate My Image's other planned activities, such as their possible protest letter regarding Connie 
Chung's Emmy nomination.</p>
<p>--	Pitch Rosemary Locke, My Image founder, to &quot;48 Hours&quot; to show &quot;48 hours in the life of an activist 
breast cancer patient.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Approach ABC-TV's &quot;Nightline&quot; to sell balanced examination of issue, tied to upcoming FDA advisory panel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	B-M working to attract Dr. Susan B. Love as spokesperson (well-regarded author, and strong 
interviewer -- out until October 15).</p>
<p>	--	Alternatives:  Reps. Mary Rose Oakar or Jolene Unsoeld, and/or a very strong patient spokesperson 
such as Rosemary Locke (My Image) or Darcy Sixt.</p>
<p>	--	High-stakes gambit, but could secure balanced, fair treatment if spokesperson is strong.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take above spokesperson to electronic &quot;morning shows,&quot; i.e., GOOD MORNING AMERICA, TODAY, CBS 
THIS MORNING.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	Tie to hearings.</p>
<p>--	Alternative spokesperson: Mrs. Priscilla Mack, Sen. Mack's wife, who was on &quot;GMA&quot; prior to her 
recent surgery.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Work with Karen Berger, medical publisher, who is contacting Barbara Walters (20/20) and Art Ulene (TODAY).<br></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>--	B-M in touch with Ms. Berger; should train her if she secures placement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	Again, her recent survey work should be peg</p>
<p>--	Possible tie-in with Dr. John Bostwick, her co-author, and Dr. Bostwick&quot;s patient Hilda Morris.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Editorial board briefings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put together team of oncologist or other doctor, two patients, Dow Corning spokesperson.</li>
<li>Focus on need (doctor), rights (patients), safety (Dow Corning).</li>
<li>B-M to begin pitching, now, to major national media:</li>
</ul>
<p>	--	NEW YORK TIMES<br>
	--	WALL STREET JOURNAL<br>
	--	WASHINGTON POST<br>
	--	WASHINGTON TIMES<br>
	--	LOS ANGELES TIMES<br>
	--	CHICAGO TRIBUNE<br>
	--	USA TODAY<br>
	--	Other major market newspapers, top 10-15 markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek meeting with key editorialists, Washington reporters, and appropriate women's/health editors and writers, for 
first week in November (or earlier if necessary).</li>
<li>B-M to provide media training for all participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Washington press conference</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the week of Congressional Women's Caucus hearings, or (if hearings don't materialize) just as lead-up to 
FDA advisory panel hearing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>	--	Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-OH) to try to set up (B-M to contact).</p>
<p>--	Press conference could include Rep. Oakar, Mrs. Priscilla Mack (Sen. Mack's wife; B-M to contact), 
and/or Rep. Jolene Unsoeld (D-WA) (B-M to contact).</p>
<p>--	B-M checking on possible women's groups who might be interested in participating.</p>
<p>	--	Press conference to be held on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>--	Key message: maintain women's right to choose.</p>
<p>--	Invite all Washington-based media who follow women's issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Premature to set plans in light of rapidly changing situation.  However, activities may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop feature stories on each breast cancer patient used as a panel presenter in favor of implants (speakers still 
to be selected).</li>
<li>Disseminate any prepared remarks to all media who had received editorial board visits the week before, as well as 
other interested media.</li>
<li>B-M to provide spokesperson training to all participants.</li>
<li>Develop range of scenarios for possible outcome; prepare to pitch &quot;day after&quot; stories based on each scenario.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CPSC, EZ Sales, Twin Oaks Hammock Company, and Safesport 
Manufacturing Company Announce Recall of Mini-Hammocks</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC), EZ Sales of Gardena, Calif., Twin Oaks Hammock Company of Louisa, Va., and Safesport 
Manufacturing Company of Chapin, S.C., are recalling 75,000 light-weight, net mini-hammocks that 
do not have spreader bars. Some EZ Sales hammocks were marketed using the &quot;Hang Ten&quot; label and 
trademark.</p>
<p>These manufacturers join 10 other manufacturers and importers of mini-hammocks without spreader 
bars who are recalling 3 million of the potentially dangerous products this year.</p>
<p>Without spreader bars to hold the mini-hammock bed open, the mini-hammock can twist around a 
child's neck as he/she is getting into or out of the mini-hammock, resulting in strangulation and death. 
When a net mini-hammock is attached to an indoor or outdoor location such as trees, decks, porches, 
or recreation rooms, it hangs like a thin rope. The mini-hammock can suddenly become twisted 
around a child's neck and strangle him. This can happen when children are attempting to climb into or 
out of, are playing on, or are swinging on mini-hammocks like swings.</p>
<p>Between 1984 and 1995, CPSC received reports of 12 children between the ages of five and 17 
years old who became entangled and died when using net mini-hammocks without spreader bars. 
CPSC is also aware of an injury to a seven-year-old girl who suffered permanent brain damage from a 
near-strangulation in a mini-hammock. Another near-fatal incident involved a five-year-old boy who 
was found entangled in a mini-hammock but was resuscitated by his mother.</p>
<p>Mini-hammocks are light-weight, portable, thin net hammocks that are made without spreader bars. 
They measure between five to seven feet wide and seven to 20 feet long. This recall affects the EZ 
Sales &quot;Hang Ten&quot; mini-hammock, Twin Oaks Backpacker mini- hammock, and the Safesport 
Portable Hammock.</p>
<p>Sporting goods stores, such as Herman's World of Sports, sold the EZ Sales &quot;Hang Ten&quot; 
mini-hammocks nationwide from 1979 to 1991 for $6 to $16. Small outdoor equipment stores sold 
the Twin Oaks mini-hammocks nationwide since the early 1980s for $8 to $14. The Twin Oaks 
mini-hammocks were also sold through catalogues. Surplus and sporting goods stores sold the 
Safesport mini-hammocks nationwide from 1994 through 1996 for about $8.</p>
<p>Consumers should immediately take down mini-hammocks from porches, decks, trees, recreation 
rooms and other locations. Consumers should return the mini-hammocks to the store where they were 
purchased for a full refund or a replacement hammock. If consumers do not know the retailer or 
manufacturer of their net mini-hammock, they should destroy the mini-hammock immediately to 
prevent strangulation death or injury.</p>
<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from unreasonable risks of injury 
or death from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a 
dangerous product or a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, 
call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a 
press release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and 
enter the release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at CPSC's web site 
at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report product 
hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</p>

<hr>


<p>Following almost two hundred years of continuous and
unwavering support of the institution we know as the grand jury,
the United States Supreme Court recently announced an opinion
which suggests the first leak in the dike of its regard for that
once exalted institution. Speaking for the six-member majority in
United States v. Dionisio,[1] Justice Stewart acknowledged that
&quot;[tlhe grand jury may not always serve its historic role as
a protective bulwark standing solidly between the ordinary
citizen and an overzealous prosecutor . . . .[2] Even stronger
expressions of concern over the continuing viability of the grand
jury are found in the dissenting opinions of Justices Douglas and
Marshall. Justice Douglas observed: &quot;It is, indeed, common
knowledge that the Grand Jury, having been conceived as a bulwark
between the citizen and the Government, is now a tool of the
Executive.[3] Justice Marshall emphasized the dangers facing
grand jury independence as compounded by the Dionisio decision
itself.[4] </p>

<p>These comments are significant not only because of their
source but also because they were not germane to the resolution
of the problem before the Court. The volunteered concern of some
of the highest judicial officers of our land over the method by
which criminal prosecutions are initiated indicates the need for
careful scrutiny of the grand jury process, particularly in the
light of modem constitutional doctrines. Accordingly, this
article presents a discussion of an important due process-equal
protection issue inherent in the two contrasting felony-charging
procedures authorized under Article 1, Section 8 of the
California Constitution, prosecution by information following a
preliminary examination or by grand jury indictment. For a full
understanding of this problem, the discussion will begin with a
review of the origin of the two procedures. </p>

<p><strong>Historical Introduction </strong></p>

<p><strong>Origin of the Grand Jury System </strong></p>

<p>Historically, the grand jury has been looked upon as a
suitable device for protecting the weak or unpopular from
judicial harassment or politically motivated prosecutions. The
grand jury is supposed to function as a body of neighbors who aid
the state in bringing criminals to justice while protecting the
innocent from unjust accusation.[5] However, both the grand jury
and the criminal information have ceased to fulfill these
original role-obligations and have become increasingly subject to
incapacitating manipulation and abuse. All of the major recent
studies conclude that the grand jury has become, in effect, a
rubber stamp of the prosecutor and not the check on his power
that it is required to be.[6] </p>

<p>The origins of the institution of the grand jury are obscure.
In some form it was found early in all the Teutonic peoples,
including the Anglo-Saxons before the Norman conquest.[7] Forms
of the grand jury have also been traced in Scandinavian countries
where jurors came to determine both law and fact.[8] The grand
jury originated in Anglo-American law with the summoning of a
group of townspeople before a public official to answer questions
under oath, a system of inquiry used for such administrative
purposes as the compilation of the Domesday Book of William the
Conqueror.[9] </p>

<p>In 1166, the crown first established the criminal grand jury,
a body of twelve knights, or other freemen whose function was to
accuse those who, according to public knowledge, had committed
crimes.[10] The purpose was to give to the central government the
benefit of local knowledge in the apprehension of those who
violated the king's peace. Witnesses as such were not heard
before this body. The use of accusing juries provided for in the
Assizes of Clarendon (1166) and Northhampton (1176), closely
resembles the modern grand jury in personnel, duties and
powers.[11] During the thirteenth and early part of the
fourteenth centuries, the grand jurors themselves served as petit
jurors in the same matters in which they presented
indictments.[12] Not until the eventual separation of the grand
jury and petit jury did the function of accusation become clearly
defined and did crown witnesses come to be examined in secret
before the grand jury.[13] By the time of the appearance of le
graunde inquest in 1368, the grand jury had acquired the powers
and duties of the present-day grand jury and it has not changed
materially since that time. [14] Even as it was still developing,
prior to le graunde inquest, the grand jury was becoming lame. As
reported by Dean Morse: </p>

<p>Holdsworth points out that the sheriff's tourn, with its
presenting jury, became so powerful in the twelfth century that
it aroused the suspicion of the king who ordered an inquest of
the sheriffs in 1170. To check the power of the sheriff's tourn,
the office of the coroner was created.[15] </p>

<p><strong>Origin of the System of Prosecution by Information </strong></p>

<p>Parallel to the development of the grand jury was the
development of the criminal information. The use of the criminal
information dates at least from the time of Edward I,
1272-1307.[16] Other evidence tracing the origins of the criminal
information makes clear that its history and use in certain times
and cases is almost as old as that of the indictment.[17] Like
its counterpart, the grand jury, the criminal information was
also subject to manipulation and abuse from early ,times. As
stated by Dean Morse: </p>

<p>The king's council came to initiate criminal prosecutions
based on informations not only of the king, but also of private
persons, and as a result, there were many false and malicious
prosecutions started and then dropped. The procedure . . . came
to be abused in that it was used for political Prosecutions . . .
. To check private persons from using information to initiate
false and malicious prosecutions, a statute was passed in 1692 [4
W. &amp; M., c.18] which required that the informations of
private citizens should be approved of by the court. . . .[18] </p>

<p>Both the grand jury and the criminal information found their
way to America, and both are used here today.[19] </p>

<p><strong>Criticism of the Grand Jury System </strong></p>

<p>In this country numerous studies undertaken to assess the
efficacy of the grand jury have all concluded that it is no
longer effective in protecting individuals against arbitrary
prosecutions, and that it no longer exercises the independent
judgment required by due process. The landmark study in this
century was conducted by Dean Wayne Morse of the University of
Oregon Law School. After an exhaustive study of 7,414 indictments
and extensive questionnaires sent to prosecutors and judges, Dean
Morse concluded: </p>

<p>Grand juries are likely to be a fifth wheel in the
administration of criminal justice in that they tend to stamp
with approval, and often uncritically, the wishes of the
prosecuting attorney. At best the grand jury tends to duplicate
the work of the committing magistrate and prosecutor.[20] </p>

<p>Dean Morse found that in only 5.15 percent of the cases
initiated by the prosecutor in which he expressed an opinion was
there a disagreement between the opinion of the prosecutors and
the grand jury dispositions.[21] Similarly, the National
Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement concluded: </p>

<p>The grand jury usually degenerates into a rubber stamp wielded
by the prosecuting officer according to the dictates of his own
sense of propriety and justice. [The grand jury] has ceased to
perform or be needed for the function for which it was
established. [22] </p>

<p>These findings are reinforced by Professor Moley who
determined that the prosecutor &quot;seems to dominate the grand
jury to such a degree that its actions are in reality his own . .
. .&quot;[23] </p>

<p>Most recently, Weinberg and Weinberg, in discussing
preliminary hearings in federal courts, concluded with respect to
grand juries: </p>

<p>The grand jury is not a proper body to reach an
&quot;independent judicial determination&quot; of probable cause.
Its determination is unlikely to be &quot;judicial&quot; because
it is composed of laymen, whose sole guidance on legal questions
will normally come from the prosecutor. Its determination is also
unlikely to be &quot;independent&quot; in most cases because, in
practice, the prosecutor's influence is usually controlling.[24] </p>

<p>The Second Circuit recently described the grand jury as
basically &quot;a law enforcement agency&quot;[25] a conclusion
supported by numerous studies.[26] Most recently William J.
Campbell, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, recommended that the grand jury be
completely eliminated and replaced by a procedure encompassing an
advisory preliminary examination before a judicial officer to
determine probable cause.[27] </p>

<p><strong>Nature and Function of the Preliminary Examination </strong></p>

<p>The due process clauses of both the Fourteenth Amendment [28]
and the California Constitution [29] require that the state adopt
a procedure which will insure that no person is required to stand
trial at the whim or caprice of the prosecuting attorney. [30]
The form is not man dated to be either a grand jury or a
preliminary examination [31] but rather a procedure which
effectively secures to the accused the substance of due process:
an independent judicial determination of the reasonableness of
the charge.[32] </p>

<p>Two methods for initiating a felony prosecution are authorize
under the California Constitution in the following language: </p>

<p>Offenses heretofore required to be prosecuted by indictment
shall be prosecuted by information, after examination and
commitment by a magistrate, or by indictment, with or without
such examination and commitment, as may be prescribed by law.[33]
</p>

<p>The California Penal Code authorizes prosecution by either
information or indictment [34] with the overwhelming majority of
all criminal prosecutions being initiated by information pursuant
to Penal Code Section 858. [35] Under this procedure, an accused
is entitled to a preliminary examination before a magistrate [36]
and is afforded the right to representation by counsel [37] and
the right to present witnesses in his own behalf.[38] </p>

<p>The California Supreme Court has described these provisions
being declaratory of fundamental procedural rights and has
stressed the earlier view of the United States Supreme Court that
the preliminary examination process &quot;'carefully considers
and guards the substantial interest of the prisoner' and thus
constitutes due process of law.&quot;[39] </p>

<p>In People v. Elliot [40] the purpose of the preliminary
examine process was described in the following language: </p>

<p>The preliminary examination is not merely a pre-trial hearing.
&quot;The purpose of the preliminary hearing is to weed out
groundless or unsupported charges of grave offenses, and to
relieve the accused of the degradation and the expense of a
criminal trial. Many an unjustifiable prosecution is stopped at
that point, where the lack of probable cause is clearly
disclosed.&quot;[41] </p>

<p>In Jennings v. Superior Court [42] this constitutional and
statutory purpose was held to require that the defendant &quot;be
permitted, if he chooses, to elicit testimony or introduce
evidence tending to overcome the prosecution's case or establish
an affirmative defense.&quot;[43] </p>

<p>The critical nature of the preliminary hearing and its
constitutional concomitant assistance of counsel, during that
stage were established recently in Coleman v. Alabama.[44]
Although Alabama law forbade the use at trial of anything that
occurred at a preliminary hearing held without counsel,
nevertheless, the Court ruled: </p>

<p>[I]t does not follow that the Alabama preliminary hearing is
not a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the State's criminal process.
The determination whether !he hearing is a &quot;critical
stage&quot; requiring the provision of counsel depends, as noted,
upon an analysis &quot;whether potential substantial prejudice to
defendant's rights inheres in the . . . confrontation and the
ability of counsel to help avoid that prejudice.&quot; United
States v. Wade, [388 U.S. 218, 227 (1967)]. Plainly the guiding
hand of counsel at the preliminary hearing is essential to
protect the indigent accused against an erroneous or improper
prosecution. First, the lawyer's skilled examination and
cross-examination of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the
State's case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the
accused over. Second, in any event, the skilled interrogation of
witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital
impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State's
witnesses at the trial. Third, trained counsel can more
effectively discover the case the State has against his client
and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet
that case at the trial. Fourth, counsel can also be influential
at the preliminary hearing in making effective arguments for the
accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric
examination or bail. The inability of the indigent accused on his
own to realize these advantages of a lawyer's assistance compels
the conclusion that the Alabama preliminary hearing is a
&quot;critical stage&quot; of the State's criminal process at
which the accused is &quot;as much entitled to such aid [of
counsel] . . . as at the trial itself.&quot; Powell v. Alabama,
[287 U.S. 45, 57 (1932 )].[45] </p>

<p>Of equal, if not greater, import to our citizens is the fact
that a preliminary examination provides them protection from the
ignominy and expense of going to trial unless there has been an
evidentiary hearing and a holding that sufficient evidence exists
to justify trial. </p>

<p><strong>Prosecution by Information and Indictment: A
Comparison</strong> </p>

<p>In a prosecution by information, California law requires that
there be an independent evidentiary determination of probable
cause in an adversary proceeding before trial [46] but no
equivalent right is granted to an accused who is prosecuted by
grand jury indictment. Where an indictment is issued by the grand
jury, the accused is not afforded the safeguard of an independent
judicial evaluation of the evidence. </p>

<p>Indictment by grand jury affords none of the fundamental
rights provided in a preliminary examination.[47] Unless he is
called as a witness, the defendant has neither the right to
appear and present evidence to the grand jury nor to confront
witnesses against him [48] Only the district attorney, the
attorney general or special counsel may appear and present
evidence.[49] Even if called as a witness, a defendant may not
have the assistance of counsel to advise him.[50] Although the
grand jury may require the district attorney to issue process for
defense witnesses when it &quot;has reason to believe that such
evidence exists,[51] this provision is of little practical
value since the proceedings are held in secret with no notice to
a defendant. Furthermore, as indicate by the opening statement of
Penal Code Section 939.7, the grand jury is &quot;not required to
hear evidence for the defendant,&quot; and thus may reject such
evidence at the very outset [52] Without hearing the evidence in
the first place, the opportunity to determine whether evidence
exists to &quot;explain away the charge&quot; is in effect
foreclosed, virtually assuring the finding of an indictment under
Penal Code Section 939.8 on the basis of &quot;unexplained or
uncontradicted&quot; evidence.[53] </p>

<p>In support of its finding, the grand jury is required to
&quot;receive none but evidence that would be admissible over
objection at the trial of a criminal action . . . . [54] In
determining what is admissible evidence, the grand jury may ask
for the advice of the judge or district attorney. However, unless
such advice is requested, the judge is excluded from the
session,[55] leaving the jury to rely upon the prosecutor to
advise it.[56] These contradictions have been the object of
criticism by one commentator who has observed: </p>

<p>When the function of indictment . is mated with the
responsibility of determining the character of the evidence that
supports it, and with the right to exclude all evidence which
could explain or contradict, the result is not proper. In short,
it is both derogatory of the jury's basic purpose and devoid of
fairness.[57] </p>

<p>Thus, a defendant who is subject to indictment by grand jury
is denied the right to present evidence to explain or contradict
the charge, has no right to appear or to have the assistance of
counsel, and may not confront and cross-examine the witnesses
against him. On the other hand, a defendant charged by
information has all of these rights in addition to the fact that,
unlike the grand jury indictment process, the evidence is judged
by a neutral and detached magistrate capable of independently
evaluating the admissibility of that evidence. </p>

<p>In this regard, the criticism voiced against the grand jury
process during the 1878-79 California Constitutional Convention
is noteworthy.[58] A number of speakers stressed that
modification of the grand jury system had been actively espoused
and generally supported in political meetings leading up to the
convention.[59] The criticism voiced by a delegate named Mr.
Huestis is still applicable today: </p>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, in order to get a more distinct idea of
this matter, let us for a moment briefly consider the functions
and duties of Grand Juries; and, as I understand it, their main
duty is to examine the record of witnesses, or both, and come to
a conclusion as to whether persons accused of crime ought to be
tried or not. This they do under the advice of the District
Attorney. In many cases they are, in whole or in part, composed
of persons ignorant of the law; and in a majority of cases, if
the District Attorney tells them that the evidence is sufficient
to convict they indict, and on the contrary, if he tells them the
evidence is not sufficient, they do not indict. They are, in the
very nature of things, almost entirely under the control of the
District Attorney, in all matters coming up in the Grand Jury
room, and merely echo his opinions. The whole thing, then,
practically viewed, merely amounts to a roundabout and very
expensive method of getting the opinion of the District Attorney.
And I submit that if this be necessary in order to insure the
ends of justice, then, in the name of common sense, why not get
the opinion of the District Attorney directly, and thus curtail
the enormous expense attending the present system.[60] Despite
these critical sentiments and those expressed by other delegates
as well, the unlimited availability of the indictment procedure
and its arbitrary use as an alternative to prosecution by
information persists to the present day. </p>

<p>A recent blatant example of arbitrary use of the grand jury
procedure, aimed at avoiding the exercise of rights accorded to a
defendant at a preliminary examination, was presented in People
v. Uhleman.[61] The defendant had been charged with the sale of
marijuana. At a lengthy preliminary hearing at which the
defendant presented evidence of entrapment, the magistrate
sustained that defense and dismissed the charges. Thereupon, the
district attorney presented his case to a grand jury and obtained
an indictment. On appeal a majority of the California Supreme
Court upheld this procedure over the vigorous dissent of Justices
Mosk and Tobriner. The majority opinion rested its conclusion on
the historic interpretation of California Penal Code Section 1387
[62] allowing the prosecution to refile felony charges regardless
of a dismissal by a magistrate.[63] Despite the obvious motive of
the prosecutor to avoid extending to the defendant those
procedural rights accorded him at the preliminary examination,
the issue was not raised by the parties nor considered by the
court.[64] </p>

<p>Such a deliberate prosecutorial circumvention of a
magistrate's adverse ruling in a preliminary hearing is a
practice of long standing. Even before the enactment of the
constitutional provision authorizing alternative charging
procedures, at a time when the preliminary hearing was utilized
only as a detention procedure for later indictment, the practice
of ignoring a magistrate's contrary ruling was bitterly
criticized by a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of
1878-79.[65] </p>

<p>The distinction between the procedures for prosecution by
indictment and prosecution by information in regard to the rights
accorded to the accused obviously placed one charged by
indictment at a considerable disadvantage. Yet, there has never
been a judicial or legislative determination which has attempted
to define a basis for discriminating between those who are and
those who are not accorded these important rights. The decision
to proceed by grand jury indictment, and thus deny the accused
these fundamental rights, is left entirely to the absolute
discretion of the district attorney.[66] </p>

<p><strong>The Equal Protection-Due Process Issue</strong> </p>

<p>The arbitrary discrimination permitted under present law
raises a serious constitutional question in light of principles
recently recognized and applied by the California Supreme Court
in the enforcement of the equal protection and due process
provisions of the United States Constitution. While recognizing
that absolute equality is not required and that differences may
exist so long as an invidious discrimination does not occur, the
court has viewed the &quot;'concept of the equal protection of
the laws [as compelling] recognition of the proposition that
persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose
of the law receive like treatment.'&quot;[67] </p>

<p>The appropriate tests for determining whether an invidious
discrimination has occurred have been described by the court as
follows: </p>

<p>The traditional test has been that the &quot;distinction drawn
by a challenged statute must bear some rational relationship to a
legitimate state end and will be set aside as violative of the
Equal Protection Clause only if based on reasons totally
unrelated to the pursuit of that goal.&quot; But a stricter
standard has been prescribed in cases involving &quot;suspect
classifications&quot; or &quot;fundamental interests.&quot; In
Westbrook v. Mihaly, [2 Cal. 3d 765, 471 P.2d 487, 87 Cal. Rptr.
839 (1970)] the [occasion was offered] to epitomize the standards
to be applied in evaluating classifications and the equal
protection clause: &quot;As the California Supreme Court has
previously noted the United States Supreme Court has tended to
employ a two-level test in reviewing legislative classifications
under the Equal Protection Clause. In the area of economic
regulation, the high court has exercised restraint, investing
legislate with a presumption of constitutionality and requiring
merely the distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some
rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.
On the other hand, in cases involving &quot;suspect
classifications&quot; or touching &quot;fundamental
interests,&quot; the court has adopted an attitude of active and
critical analysis, subjecting the classification to strict
scrutiny. Under the strict standard applied in such cases, the
state bears the burden of establishing not only that it has a
compelling interest which justifies the law but that the
distinctions drawn the law are necessary to further its
purpose.[68] </p>

<p>The discrimination which results from the choice of a grand
jury indictment as opposed to prosecution by information
undoubtedly touches on fundamental interests, such as the right
to assistance of counsel, the right to confront witnesses and the
right to present evidence.[69] Accordingly, the &quot;strict
standard&quot; would be applicable, placing upon the state
&quot;the burden of establishing not only that it has a
compelling interest which justifies the law but that the
distinction drawn by law are necessary to further its
purpose.&quot;[70] </p>

<p>The legislature has made no effort to establish any standards
distinguish between accused persons who are or are not entitled a
preliminary examination; the power to make that determination has
been lodged entirely with the district attorney. His decision to
proceed by grand jury may be motivated solely by his desire to
foreclose the accused from obtaining an examination before a
magistrate and from exercising the fundamental rights accorded
therein. As noted above, district attorneys have cited a number
of typical reasons for using the grand jury process as an
alternative to the preliminary examination.[71] Of these, only
one can be considered necessary to the compelling interest of
enforcement of the criminal law, the tolling of the statute of
limitations in the case of a suspect who has fled the
jurisdiction of the court. In regard to the other reasons cited,
no necessity would appear to justify denying the fundamental
procedural rights which are accorded to persons prosecuted by
information. </p>

<p><strong>Past Decisions </strong></p>

<p>In People v. Sirhan [72] the California Supreme Court rejected
a contention that prosecution by indictment violated equal
protection and due process. But the issue was given only cursory
consideration. Furthermore, unlike People v. Uhlemann, [73] the
issue did not arise in a factual context which depicted the
procedure's potential for discriminatory abuse. There was no
initial effort by the prosecution to proceed by complaint and
preliminary examination and then to circumvent arbitrarily the
preliminary examination procedure, thus cutting off the
defendant's rights to confront and present witnesses. In Sirhan,
selection of the grand jury process could well be justified from
the standpoint of protecting the defendant's personal safety in
view of the great public furor directed against him. This issue,
one of many, was summarily resolved by the conclusionary
statement that &quot;a defendant who is proceeded against by an
indictment is not denied due process or equal protection,[74]
which was followed by the citation of several California Court of
Appeal decisions.[75] </p>

<p>The crucial omission in the Sirhan ruling was the lack of any
effort to apply the court's invidious discrimination test for
determining an equal protection violation involving suspect
classifications or fundamental interests as articulated in In re
Antazo [76] and Serrano v. Priest.[77] The court merely made
brief reference to several earlier United St Supreme Court
decisions on discriminatory classifications involving race,
indigency or type of offense,[78] brushing these aside as not
relevant to the provisions in question. </p>

<p>Analogous Precedents </p>

<p>Despite the Sirhan ruling, the conclusion that the indictment
process does violate due process and equal protection is clearly
support by several recent California and federal decisions. In re
Gary W.[79] and In re Franklin, [80] are two California Supreme
Court decisions involving procedural discriminations in which,
unlike Sirhan, the Antazo Serrano test was applied, resulting in
the declaration of an equal protection-due process violation. </p>

<p>The issue in Gary W. concerned the constitutionality of a
California statute which denied the right to a jury trial for
Youth Authority wards in proceedings to determine whether they
should remain subject to the control of the authority beyond the
normal discharge date based on the authority's determination that
the discharge would be dangerous to the public.[81] Referring to
the statutes allowing trial by jury for confinement of other
dangerous types,[82] the court recognized that the state may not
&quot;arbitrarily accord privileges to or impose disabilities
upon one class unless some rational distinction between those
included in and those excluded from the class exists.[83] While
allowing that any rational connection between the distinctions
and the legitimate purpose of a statute will normally suffice,
the court distinguished those statutes which affect fundamental
interest, placing upon the state the burden of establishing the
existence of a compelling interest and the need for a class
distinction to further that interest.[84] </p>

<p>A similar conclusion was reached in In re Franklin.[85]
Relying upon Gary W., the court ruled that equal protection and
due process required that persons committed after being found not
guilty by reason of insanity under the Penal Code,[86] were
entitled upon request to trial by jury to determine their fitness
for release. This was justified on the ground that trial by jury
was afforded to other persons committed as mentally ill under the
civil commitment statutes and no basis was shown for
distinguishing between the two categories. </p>

<p>In the above decisions, the California Supreme Court relied
upon the United States Supreme Courts ruling in Baxstrom v.
Herold.[87] In that case, a state prisoner had been involuntarily
committed for mental illness near the end of his prison term
without a jury trial even though such trials were afforded to all
other persons civilly committed. In declaring this procedure
unconstitutional, the Court observed that [t]he State, having
made this substantial review proceeding generally available on
this issue, may not, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, arbitrarily withhold it from some. .
. . Equal protection does not require that all persons be dealt
with identically, but it does require that a distinction made
have some relevance to the purpose for which classification is
made. . . . For purposes of granting judicial review before a
jury of the question whether a person is mentally ill and in need
of institutionalization, there is no conceivable basis for
distinguishing the commitment of a person who is nearing the end
of a penal term from all other civil commitments.[88] </p>

<p>The same reasoning seems equally applicable to the judicial
procedures leading to a determination of whether a persons
liberty is to be placed in jeopardy in a criminal prosecution. </p>

<p>More recently, the United States Supreme Court has had
occasion to apply the Baxstrom ruling in two unanimous and highly
pertinent decision, Jackson v Indiana [89] and Humphrey v. Cady
[90] In Jackson, the Supreme Court declared that Indiana's
statutory commitment procedures for accused persons found to be
mentally ill and unable to comprehend the proceedings against
them violated equal protection and due process because they
established a more lenient commitment standard and a more
stringent release standard than those applicable to other persons
civilly committed. In Humphrey, the Court reversed a summary
denial of habeas corpus and remanded for hearing a state
prisoner's claim that extension of his term of commitment on a
finding that he was a dangerous sex offender violated equal
protection and due process because he was not accorded trial by
jury and other procedural rights given to persons civilly
committed. The following statement from the opinion delivered by
Mr. Justice Marshall is especially pertinent to the present
subject: </p>

<p>The equal protection claim would seem to be especially
persuasive if it develops on remend that petitioner was deprived
of a jury determination , or of other procedural
protections,merely by arbitrary decision of the State to seek his
commitment under one stature rather than the other.[91] </p>

<p>Clearly, a defendant who is indicted rather than prosecuted by
information following a preliminary hearing is deprived of
fundamental procedural rights &quot;merely by arbitrary decison
of ths state to seek his commitment under one statute rather than
another.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A Suggested Remedy</strong> </p>

<p>The Franklin and Gary W. decisions suggest a remedy for
correcting the present iniquity of the indictment process. Those
rulings imposed a requirement of trial by jury where the
legislature has not so provided. Similarly, the legislature has
not provided for a preliminary examination as part of the
indictment process, despite authorization to do so under the
state constitution.[92] Accordingly , the equal protection-due
process defect could be readily corrected by merely requiring
that in cased of prosecution by indictment, a defendant be
allowed a preliminary examination upon request. Such examination
could be conducted after indictment and prior to trial before a
judge of the Superior Court acting as a magistrate, as allowed
under Penal Code.[93] </p>

<p>A similar procedural requirement was recently imposed by the
Michigan Supreme Court in People v. Duncan.[94] The defendant had
contended that his equal protection-due process rights had been
violated by not according him a preliminary examination. The
court deliberately avoided the constitutional question. Instead ,
in the exercise or its supervisory authority over lower court
procedures, the court did order that preliminary hearings be
granted in all indictment cases where requested prior to trial,
This was justified on the basis of the modern efficiency of the
preliminary examination process and the inequities of the grand
jury process.[95] </p>

<p>The requirement of an optional preliminary examination in
indictment cases is not likely to cause a significant burden upon
the courts because the indictment procedure is utilized in only a
small percentage of cases. During 1971 only 2.889 or 4.1 percent
of the 70,663 Superior Court felony filings were prosecuted by
indictment.[96] Furthermore, such preliminary hearings may result
in a greater number of dismissals or settlements without trial
because of prosecutors being persuaded after cross-examination of
their witnesses that their cases are weak or because of
defendants being convinced after confronting the witnesses
against them that they ought to plead guilty.[97] Such hearings
may result also in submission on the evidence presented, without
further trial, as is done with submissions on preliminary
examination transcripts which occurs in nearly 75 percent of the
trials held in Los Angeles county.[98] Excellent precedent exists
for judicial imposition of such a procedural requirement to
conform the indictment process to constitutional standards. As
noted above, recent California Supreme Court decisions now
require trial by jury for dangerous Youth Authority offenders and
for insane offenders.[99] </p>

<p>In addition, there is the example of a judicial remedy to
correct constitutionally defective procedures fashioned in the
United States Supreme Courts recent decision in Morrisey v
Brewer.[100] In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Burger the
Court imposed upon the states a due process requirement that, in
parole revocation cases,parolees must be afforded the right to
both preliminary hearings and formal revocation hearings. The
procedural requirements for these hearings, as set out in the
Morrisey opinion , are detailed and substantial. A parolee must
be given prior notice of the preliminary haring and be afforded
the opportunity to present relevant information and to question
adverse informants.[101] There must be a hearing officer who is
an uninvolved person and he must make a summary or digest of
the hearing and state the reasons for finding of probable cause
to hold the parolee.[102] More formal proceedings are required
for the final revocation hearing, including written notice,
confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, the right to
present evidence , a neutral and detached haring body and a
written statement of findings.[103] By comparison to this, the
above proposal for modification of the indictment procedure to
conform with settled dtandards of equal protection and due
process seems quite modest.[104] </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Felony suspects who desire to contest the existence of
probable cause to support a formal accusation against them
presently face a substantial handicap when accused by a grand
jury indictment as opposed to being accused by information. Under
the latter procedure, they are entitled to the right to counsel,
the right to confront witnesses and the right to present
evidence--rights which protect fundamental interests at a
critical stage of the proceedings.[105] Yet, those rights may be
entirely denied in the absolute discretion of the district
attorney to proceed by grand jury indictment in lieu of
prosecution by information. </p>

<p>No compelling state interest is apparent to justify such
discrimination. Because of the California Supreme Courts
recently articulated equal protection-due process test for
invidious discrimination [106] and the United States Supreme
Courts recent expansion of due process requirements [107] in
dealing with parole revocations, it would appear that a
modification of this arbitrary power to prosecute by grand jury
indictment sans preliminary hearing may soon be anticipated. </p>

&quot;The grand jury is not required to hear evidence for the
defendant, but it shall weigh all the evidence submitted to it
and when it has reason to believe that other evidence within its
reach will explain away the charge, it shall order the evidence
to be produced, and for that purpose may require the district
attorney to issue process for the witnesses.&quot; </p>

district attorneys, 272 true bills were returned, or 94.1
percent. Note, Some Aspects of the California Grand Jury System,
8 Stan. L. Rev. 631, 654 (1956). This is consistent with the
criticism that the grand jury system is merely a rubber stamp.
E.g. Morse, supra note 6 , at 363. On the other hand, one cannot
conclude that the preliminary examination screening rate is much
better. A recent study in Los Angeles indicates that roughly 90
percent of the preliminary examinations resulted in holding
orders. Graham &amp; Letwin, The Preliminary Hearings in Los
Angeles: Some Field Findings and Legal Policy Observations, 18
U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 636, 723-24 (1971). The authors also report that
in 1966, 30 percent of these dismissals failed to terminate the
prosecutions, and in 1967, the figure was 25 percent. Id. at 729.

<p>56. In McFarland v Superior Court, 88 Cal App. 2d 153, 160,
198 P.2d 318, 322 (1948), the court pointed out that, [t]he
district attorney or his deputies may properly appear before the
grand jury, upon request of the grand jury, or otherwise, to give
advice or to interrogate witnesses. Likewise, the attorney
general is empowered to procure counsel to present evidence in a
matter under investigation before the grand jury. In Stern v.
Superior Court, 78 Cal. App. 2d 9, 177 P.2d 308 (1947), the
district attorney and some of his assistants were with the grand
jury at times in the absence of the reporter. The court held that
the grand jury is entitled to the legal advice of the district
attorney . . . and the law does not require the presence of a
reporter while such advice is being given . . . . Id. at 13,
177 P.2d at 310. </p>

<p>57. Comment, The Nature of the California Grand Jury: An
Evaluation, 2 Santa Clara Law. 72, 76 (1962). The role of the
district attorney in presenting the evidence and advising the
grand jury on its admissibility is somewhat analogous to a
juvenile court referee presenting and examining witnesses and
ruling on the admissibility of their testimony. The latter
procedure has been held contrary to due process. In re Ruth H.,
26 Cal. App. 3d 77, 102 Cal. Rptr. 534 (1972); Gloria M. v.
Superior Court, 21 Cal. App. 3d 525, 98 Cal. Rptr. 604 (1971);
Lois R. v. Superior Court, 19 Cal. App. 3d 895, 97 Cal. Rptr. 158
(1971). The prosecutor's responsibility in assuring that
&quot;none but legal evidence&quot; is received by the grand jury
is carried out in some counties by the district attorney asking
all the questions with the jurors passing him written questions.

<p>64. In an amicus curiae brief, the California Public Defenders
Association did raise this issue, which was briefly alluded to by
Mr. Justice Mosk in a footnote to his dissenting opinion,
indicating that it &quot;touched on a sensitive nerve&quot; and
involved &quot;provocative due process and equal protection
problems.&quot; 9 Cal. 3d at 670 n.1, 511 P.2d at 614 n.1, 108
Cal. Rptr. at 662 n.1 (Mosk, J., dissenting). Although he did not
consider this issue, Mr. Justice Mosk did raise another point
urged by amicus, that the circumvention of the magistrate's order
was a violation of the constitutional doctrine of separation of
powers, Cal. Const. art. I, 1, as recently applied in Esteybar
v. Municipal Court, 5 Cal. 3d 119, 485 P.2d 1140, 95 Cal. Rptr.
524 (1971) and People v. Tenorio, 3 Cal. 3d 89, 473 P.2d 993, 89
Cal. Rptr. 249 (1970). People v. Uhlemann, 9 Cal. 3d 662, 676-77,
511 P.2d 609, 618-19, 108 Cal. Rptr. 657, 666-67 (1973) (Mosk,
J., dissenting). </p>

<p>65. The delegate, an attomey named Barbour, described the
following experience with this practice in a case in which he
defended Denis Kearney and others on riot charges stemming from a
meeting on San Francisco's Nob Hill: &quot;[T]he District
Attorney, for his own purposes . . . can make an engine of
oppression out of that very institution [the grand jury]. I
myself was concerned, and these delegates elected from San
Francisco, in a case that distinctly illustrates that
proposition. Denis Keamey, Dr. O'Donnell, Wellock, and various
parties, as is well known, were arrested in San Francisco upon
numerous charges. Among other charges preferred against them was
one that they had committed a riot, by holding a meeting on Nob
Hill, within the sacred precincts of the magnates of the railroad
corporation. They were taken before a committing magistrate. It
was fully examined before the committing magistrate. I myself
appeared as one of the associate counsel for the defense, and
after a full and complete examination of the foundationless and
groundless charge against these men he discharged them. Now he
did not send it before the Grand Jury. That ought to have been
the end of that charge. What happened? Hostility existed between
the magistrate and the District Attorney. After the sitting of
the next Grand Jury the District Attorney presents that very
identical case, that very identical charge, in the shape of an
indictment, before the very identical Court which had discharged
them. They were compelled to undergo the expense of a trial all
over again about the very identical matter, and which resulted in
the fiasco, the history of which is well known. 1 Debates and
Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of the State of
California 312 (1880). </p>

<p>66. A 1963 survey of several large district attorney offices
in Northern California reveals the variety of reasons given by
district attorneys for avoiding the preliminary examination
process: &quot;(1) when the accused has evaded apprehension and
the statute of limitations would bar an information requiring the
presence of the accused; (2) when the district attorney desires
to avoid premature cross-examination of emotional or reluctant
witnesses; (3) when there is great public interest in the case
and the district attorney, for political reasons, desires to
share responsibility for prosecution with the grand jury; (4)
when the investigative powers of the grand jury are useful, as in
complex fraud cases or those involving corruption in public
office, and (5) when the district attorney believes that
employing the grand jury would be speedier than using preliminary
examination procedures, as in cases involving multiple defendants
or offenses.&quot; Comment, The California Grand Jury--Two
Current Problems, 52 Calif. L Rev. 116, 118 (1964) (footnotes
omitted). In light of People v. Uhlemann, 9 Cal. 3d 662, 511 P.2d
609, 108 Cal. Rptr. 657 (1973) and the case described by delegate
Barbour, see note 64 supra, to these may be added cases in which
the magistrate has dismissed charges at a preliminary examination
due to the presentation of evidence by a defendant. </p>

defendant had not cited any authority. In People v. Newton, 8
Cal. App. 3d 359, 388, 87 Cal. Rptr. 394, 412 (1970) the argument
was rejected on the basis of the Flores decision. In People v.
Pearce, 8 Cal. App. 3d 984, 989, 87 Cal. Rptr. 814, 817 (1970) it
was turned down because &quot;[t]he defendant had not claimed or
presented facts to support the inference that the indictment
procedure was chosen in his case due to some arbitrary or
purposeful act on the part of some state official.&quot; In In re
Wells, 20 Cal. App. 3d 640, 649, 98 Cal. Rptr. 1, 5-6 (1971) the
court summarily rejected the argument citing Pearce, Newton and
Flores. Only in People v. Rojas, 2 Cal. App. 3d 767, 771, 82 Cal.
Rptr. 862, 864-65 (1969) did the court concede that a defendant
is denied procedural constitutional right by the indictment
process, but nevertheless overruled the equal protection claim
becuase of the historic origin and past approval of the grand
jury system. </p>

examination and its unrealized potential are discussed by
Professors Graham and Letwin in their extensive study of the
procedure in Los Angeles County. Contraty to earlier forecasts
that the preliminary examination would place tremendous power in
the hands of the prosecutor, they conclude that  the
preliminary hearing may well be the most important procedural
mechanism in the administrationof criminal justice in thes county
though few of the participants seem to have viewed it as such. By
virtue of procedural rules governing the hearing and its
constitutional role as the successor to the grand jury, the
magistrate in the preliminary is the only judicail officer with
sufficient discretionary power to counterbalance the vast
authority given the prosecutor. Id. at 953 (footnotes omitted) </p>

<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>

<p>Recent Supreme Court decisions in United States v.
Bisceglia,[1] California Bankers Association v. Schultz,[2] and
United States v. Miller [3] create concern about the intrusion of
government into areas of personal and financial affairs in which
citizens have had some expectation of privacy. The Bisceglia
decision held that the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) has
authority under Internal Revenue Code sections 7601 and 7602 [4]
to issue an administrative summons to a bank in order to discover
the identity of the depositor of four hundred deteriorated
hundred dollar bills. These bills raised the suspicion that
transactions involving the money might not have been properly
reported for income tax purposes.[5] In California Bankers
Association, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Bank
Secrecy Act of 1970 [6] and held that the maintenance of detailed
records pursuant to the Act did not violate a depositor's fourth
amendment rights.[7] Against this backdrop, the Court in Miller
held that a bank depositor has no protectable fourth amendment
interest in bank records relating to his account and maintained
pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. The Court, thereby, completely
opened the way for unrestrained government access to personal
banking records via an administrative summons.[8] The Supreme
Court decided Miller knowing that a section 7602 [9]
administrative summons is subject to abuse by I.R.S. agents since
the agents have unsupervised discretionary power to issue and
serve it. Thus, the combination of the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act's
record-keeping requirements and the ease with which an
administrative summons can be issued allows the I.R.S. to search
anyone's bank records with impunity. </p>

<p>The nation as a whole was surprised to be told by the Supreme
Court that no one had an expectation of privacy in his or her
personal bank accounts. The Miller decision was particularly
startling because the Supreme Court first recognized the concept
of privacy in 1963 [10] in a context suggesting a departure from
eighteenth century concepts emphasizing a property analysis.
Accordingly, in recent years, well respected courts have given
greater recognition to this developing privacy doctrine.[11] </p>

<p>The Supreme Court's return to an eighteenth century analysis
is alarming because the regression fails to address itself to the
problems of a modern technological society that makes possible
the maintenance and easy retrieval of a tremendous amount of
personal information, particularly with respect to customers of
financial institutions. The importance of such information to
investigators is well recognized.[12] In addition to records
voluntarily maintained by banks, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970
requires additional detailed recording of virtually every banking
transaction. Such well kept records create a serious threat to
privacy as we know it today and can lead to such abuses as the
covert investigation of citizens by the government. In order to
place the problem in perspective, this article explores the
procedural and substantive legal context of Miller, the
eighteenth century origins of the privacy doctrine, recent
changes in the definition of privacy, the effects of the Miller
decision, and the congressional response to this decision. </p>

<p><strong>II. BANK RECORDS AND THE I.R.S. PRIOR TO MILLER </strong></p>

<p>Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1976 [13] a depositor who
wanted to safeguard his banking records against uncontrolled
government inspection was procedurally precluded from attempting
to do so.[14] The rules allowing the I.R.S. to search bank
records did not provide for notice to the depositor.[15] The
depositor legally could rely only upon his bank to defend his
interests or to notify him voluntarily so he could take such
action. In either circumstance, however, both the bank and the
depositor were denied standing to litigate their claims. </p>

<p><strong>A. Standing Doctrine: Personal Injury to the Bank</strong>
</p>

<p>Whether a litigant has standing to sue involves a rule of
judicial economy which often is at issue when the legality of
government action is challenged on grounds that it exceeds
constitutional or statutory limitations or violates a private
right.[16] The doctrine requires the court to determine whether
the litigant is entitled to judicial review; that is, whether he
is the proper person to raise the claim. If the court decides
that the challenger is not properly situated, the merits of the
claim will not be heard. </p>

<p>Ordinarily, problems that arise in claims of private wrongs
are analyzed under real party in interest principles as set forth
in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a).[17] It is not unusual
to find standing requirements confused with real party in
interest requirements.[18] To the extent that standing means that
the litigant must establish that the - challenged governmental
activity caused &quot;injury in fact,&quot;[19] the standing
requirement bears a close resemblance to the real party in
interest rule.[20] Standing, however, is distinct from Rule 17(a)
to the extent that the requirement derives from the &quot;case or
controversy&quot; definition of judicial power expressed in
Article III.[21] In this sense, the doctrine represents a
constitutional limitation on the subject matter jurisdiction of
federal courts.[22] The standing doctrine is further
differentiated from Rule 17(a) in that it operates as a
discretionary method of judicial calendar management. </p>

<p>The doctrine of standing has been variously defined. Moreover,
its requisites remain so vague that it remains a powerful tool of
judicial policy making. At a minimum, the party seeking to be
heard must establish injury in fact to an interest or right that
was intended to be protected under a particular statutory or
constitutional rubric.[23] </p>

<p>The doctrine requires determining whether a party has
&quot;such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as
to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the
presentation of issues. . . .&quot; [24] This requirement
critically shifts the emphasis from a conceptual search for
direct injury to a functional process of determining policy or
the characteristics of a &quot;personal stake&quot; sufficient to
permit judicial review of the controversy. It also improperly
focuses attention on the party seeking to be heard rather than on
the issues to be presented. It implies that determination of
standing is to be made without considering the merits of the case
when the contrary is true. The critical question becomes that of
identifying the circumstances in which a litigant has enough of a
&quot;personal stake&quot; to ensure concrete, adverse legal
interests. Arguably, a bank has that kind of &quot;personal
stake&quot; both in terms of the cost burden imposed on it by the
federal record-keeping requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and
in terms of the cost of litigation in cases arising out of third
party summonses. In California Bankers Association, however, the
Court concluded that record-keeping requirements were far from
unreasonable and not so great an economic burden as to deny the
banks due process.[25] Further, in regard to the costs of
litigation, such expenditures may be too remote and speculative
to qualify as the kind of &quot;personal stake&quot; necessary to
establish standing. </p>

<p><strong>B. Standing Doctrine, Third Party Injury to Customers</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>1. Generally</strong> </p>

<p>The more difficult question is whether a bank or any other
financial institution has standing to assert claims on behalf of
its depositors or customers. The Court, in a limited class of
cases, has permitted a named party or one against whom a sanction
is applicable to assert the rights of injured third persons.[26]
There is no clear, fixed rule under which these exceptional cases
fall, but one common factor is that the third party whose rights
are being asserted is not in a position to assert or vindicate
his own rights.[27] Usually, a case is governed by the general
rule that a person has standing to vindicate only his own rights.
It should be noted, however, that this conclusory approach
frequently hides the fact that the court is refusing as a matter
of policy to define and determine certain issues because of the
identity of a party properly before the court, or because of the
circumstances in which the issues are being presented.[28] </p>

<p>While the Court in California Bankers Association left the
question undecided, it implied that a bank may not have standing
to litigate a depositor's claim of injury if the bank itself was
not injured by the third party summons.[29] If So, this stance
could be supported by invoking the jurisdictional limitations of
Article III and the requirement that a litigant must allege a
direct and immediate personal injury to his own protectable
rights.[30] In his dissenting opinion, Justice Douglas argued,
however, that a bank would have standing, based upon Sierra Club
v. Morton in which the Court had said that &quot;an organization
whose members are injured may represent those members in a
proceeding for judicial review.&quot; [31] The Sierra Club case
demonstrates that Article III does not invariably require
personal injury and that sometimes a relationship between a
proper party and a person injured in fact is sufficient,
particularly when there are &quot;weighty countervailing
policies&quot; [32] such that a court may appropriately exercise
discretion to grant standing.[33] </p>

<p>There is precedent for granting standing when the challenged
activity adversely affects a beneficial or advantageous
relationship existing between a litigant and a party not before
the court whose rights may be violated.[34] It is obvious that a
mutually beneficial relationship exists between banks and their
depositors. Its nature is analogous to that of any fiduciary
relationship, and there are direct economic benefits accruing to
both parties. </p>

<p>The other side of the coin is that a beneficial relationship,
to the extent it provides the third party with ability to
vindicate his own rights, may result in denial of standing to a
litigant who attempts to assert those rights on his own behalf.
If the third party's position is such that it is difficult or
impossible to protect his own interests, standing may be granted;
[35] but when he could easily protect his own interests, it may
be denied. [36] It has been suggested that when the person whose
rights are invoked is clearly in a position to assert them
effectively, there may be some advantage to a rule denying
standing even to a party in some relationship with that person.
The fact that a non-party has not asserted his own rights may
indicate that he views them differently, or for some reason
believes that it is better not to assert them in view of the
consequences likely to be entailed. This residual concept might
conveniently be thought of as a &quot;best plaintiff&quot; rule.
[37] </p>

<p><strong>2. The Depositor's Dilemma</strong> </p>

<p>It was nearly impossible procedurally for a bank depositor to
vindicate his own rights when an I.R.S. summons had been issued
to his bank because under the former law there was no requirement
that depositors be notified of such action. [38] Even if the bank
voluntarily notified its depositor,[39] his potential lawsuit
would become moot should the bank comply with the summons without
causing the I.R.S. to resort to judicial enforcement.[40] </p>

<p>When an organization and its members have corresponding
rights, it may be easier to determine that there is sufficient
injury to both parties to permit the organization to sue on
behalf of its membership.[41] Some lower courts, however, have
allowed standing to organizations without even exploring that
question.[42] On the subject of organizational standing, it has
been suggested that </p>

<p>[a]though there is little explicit indication in the opinions,
it seems inevitable that such standing will be confined to
interests central to the purpose of the organization. A labor
organization would have a much more obvious claim to challenge
job safety regulations than draft regulations. Likewise, the
organization ordinarily should be subject to the same procedural
requirements as the members whose rights it is asserting, unless
cumulation of their interests can be shown to affect the
organization itself. . . . And if only one or a small proportion
of members are affected, it may be preferable to require that the
members be left to their own litigation unless there is some
reason to fear intimidation of individual litigants,
[especially]. . . in situations of uniquely individual claims for
physical injury or other distinctive personal wrongs .[43] </p>

<p>Under this rubric, to assure even minimum representation of
the depositor's interest in the nondisclosure of his personal
bank records, a bank at its own expense has to refuse to comply
with an administrative summons, thus compelling the I.R.S. to
initiate an enforcement proceeding against the bank in the local
district court. Although the bank could seek to represent the
interests of the depositor at that proceeding, the depositor
would have a better chance to assert his interests if he could
appear on his own behalf. Former law, however, did not even grant
the depositor notice of the original administrative summons, much
less of a subsequent judicial proceeding to enforce it. If the
bank voluntarily gave notice, the depositor still encountered
problems in seeking to intervene. </p>

<p><strong>C. Intervention Problems for the Taxpayer-Depositor</strong>
</p>

<p>In First National Bank v. United States,[44] the Supreme Court
held that an I.R.S. summons directed to a third party bank did
not violate either the taxpayer's or the bank's fourth amendment
rights. That decision was reaffirmed in Donaldson v. United
States.[45] A section 7602 summons permits the I.R.S. to request
that a third party voluntarily disclose information on taxable
persons and objects.[46] The crux of the problem was the
procedural impasse encountered by a taxpayer who wanted to
contest the propriety of such solicitation by the Service. </p>

<p>Since neither the I.R.S. nor the bank was obligated to notify
a taxpayer-depositor that he was under investigation or that a
summons had been served on his bank concerning a tax matter
relating to him, [47] a great deal of government
&quot;spying&quot; could take place without the taxpayer even
being aware of it. So far as the record-keeping requirements of
the Bank Secrecy Act are concerned, Congress' announced purpose
was that the information 21 would have &quot;a high degree of
usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or
proceedings.[48] Justice Douglas has argued that it is
&quot;sheer nonsense&quot; to assume that all bank records of
every citizen will prove so useful unless we also assume that
every citizen is a crook.[49] He cautioned: </p>

<p>In a sense a person is defined by the checks he writes. By
examining them the agents get to know his doctors, lawyers,
creditors, political allies, social connections, religious
affiliation, educational interests, the papers and magazines he
reads, and so on ad infinitum. These are all tied to one's social
security number; and now that we have data banks, these other
items will enrich that storehouse and make it possible for a
bureaucrat-by pushing one button-to get in an instant the names
of the 190 million Americans who are subversives or potential and
likely candidates.[50] </p>

<p>Under former law, if the bank upon which the summons was
served decided to comply without compelling the I.R.S. to resort
to judicial enforcement, any potential taxpayer-depositor action
to restrict access to the summoned financial records was
mooted.[51] Even if the taxpayer-depositor was notified or
otherwise learned that a summons had been issued, he had no
mandatory right to intervene.[52] Under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 24(b), however, a trial judge had discretionary
authority to permit intervention [53] if the taxpayer could
demonstrate a proprietary interest in the summoned records, a
legally privileged or confidential relationship with the third
party custodian, or that the evidence leading to the records was
obtained by illegal means.[54] Once again, the depositor was
thwarted since he was unable to prove that an inspection of the
bank's records violated his fourth amendment rights. </p>

<p><strong>III BEFORE MILLER: PROTECTING BANK RECORDS UNDER THE
FOURTH AMENDMENT </strong></p>

<p><strong>A. Historical Perspective </strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, in order to claim the benefits of the
exclusionary rule, a claimant has had to prove not only that the
search was unreasonable [55] but also that it violated a personal
fourth amendment interest.[56] The latter requirement does not
include the right to claim a violation of another's rights to
possess property free from government intrusion.[57] </p>

<p>Historically, the right of possession has meant some actual
physical interest in the searched structure or the surrounding
premises.[58] The scope has been intended to include not only
places owned by the protected party, but also premises lawfully
occupied.[59] Since most seizures flow from searches of
particular premises, the great majority of cases have analyzed
the claimant's right to possess or occupy the particular place
searched. Until Miller, the Supreme Court had never directly
considered the question whether mere ownership of seized property
was sufficient to give rise to constitutional protections.[60]
While most individuals and banks consider banking records
personal and private, the problem in extending the protection of
the fourth amendment to bank records prior to Miller was t
demonstrate a protectable interest under traditional fourth
amendment analysis. Basically, a showing was required that the
search of the bank's premise violated the depositor's right to
possession.[62] When these requirements were applied to bank
records, the depositor's claim regularly failed on the ground of
insufficient constitutional interest since the premises searched
belonged to the bank, and the papers or documents seized either
belonged to the ban or were in the banks possession.[63] </p>

<p><strong>B. Toward a Changing Concept of Privacy </strong></p>

<p>The fourth amendment has long represented protection of the
basic American interest in privacy and the right to be left
alone.[64] The frame of the Constitution were responding to
abusive colonial police practices in the form of general search
warrants and writs of assistance when the mandated: </p>

<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.{65} </p>

<p>The framers quite clearly were addressing themselves to the
protection of personal information from government
inspection.[66] The words chosen to express their concerns are
interesting from a twentieth century perspective of drastically
altered technology and reflect to a great extent the on-going
problem of maintaining a system of rules against the rush of
technological change.[67] In the context of eighteenth century
technology, however, the solution to the terrorism of the general
search and writs of assistance was to specifically preclude
physical intrusion. This solution was accomplished by carefully
defining protected physical property. Understandably, traditional
analysis of fourth amendment problems employs a mechanical
property test to determine whether a searched area is within a
physical place protected by the fourth amendment.[68] The end
result is a body of search and seizure case law constantly
engaged in battle with new technology, and the creation of
narrow, rigid property rules by case law, which in turn are
regularly fragmented by new technology. Rules capable of
accommodating changing technology and norms would be much better.
While reliance upon precedent provides historical continuity and
the authority of historical justification,[69] the path in this
area has become so tortuous that it is indeed refreshing to
observe a court taking a forward view and creating rules designed
to solve not only today's but tomorrow's technological problems.
An analysis of case law in the privacy area shows several
examples of such foresight. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the watershed opinions involve issues
related to speech and sex since both of these areas are marked by
strong personal norms. In Katz v. United States,[70] the bugging
of a telephone booth provided none of the conventional handles
for rendering a search unconstitutional. In surveilling the
telephone conversation, government agents attached a listening
device to the exterior of the booth without any physical
penetration of the booth itself. In casting aside the questions
of whether a telephone booth is a protected area and whether
physical penetration of the space was required before a search
would be held illegal, the Court declared that the fourth
amendment protects people, not places, and that the bugging here
violated the &quot;privacy upon which [the defendant] justifiably
relied.[71] The Court rejected the traditional analysis which
looked only to the protection of property rights, which here
included the telephone booth user's interest in possession of
that space, and shifted to an analysis of his expectation of
privacy. </p>

<p>In Griswold v. Connecticut, [72] the Court concluded that a
statute which prohibited the dissemination of birth control
information was unconstitutional because it violated the due
process clause of the fourteenth amendment. The Court held that
the statute was an impermissible invasion of the constitutional
right of privacy emanating from the &quot;penumbras&quot; of the
first, third, fourth, fifth, and ninth amendments.[73] The Court
further noted that the right of privacy was &quot;older than the
Bill of Rights&quot; and as such was a fundamental right.[74]
Later Supreme Court decisions have made it clear that the equal
protection clause of the fourteenth amendment requires the
showing of a compelling state interest in order to justify an
infringement of the fundamental right of privacy.[75] </p>

<p>While there is no definitive rule explicated in either
Griswold or Katz, two currents are clear: the right of privacy is
an interest separate from a strict property right, and the
concept has evolved as a function both of conventional values and
of existing technology. </p>

<p>The &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; approach has been
adopted by the California Supreme Court. In People v. Krivda,
[76] the warrantless curbside search of a trash can awaiting
collection was held illegal. In reaching its conclusion, the
California Supreme Court expressly declared that a property right
in discarded trash was unnecessary and followed the Katz
analysis.[77] </p>

<p>In the area of arrest records, there has been judicial
recognition of the potential threat to privacy inherent in
centralized computer records.[78] The Colorado Supreme Court was
the first to recognize these dangers in its landmark opinion in
Davidson v. Dill [79] in which it expunged the arrest records of
innocent arrestees, resting its analysis upon the penumbra of
privacy rights enunciated in Griswold. The trend continued in the
State of Washington in Eddy v. Moore,[80] which overruled a state
statute providing for the maintenance of arrest records, and
recognized the devastating effect of disseminating arrest
records. In light of this judicial recognition of the right to
privacy and the acknowledgment that the fourth amendment protects
people not places, Miller placed law and order values and the
right to privacy on a collision course. </p>

<p><strong>IV. EXPECTATIONS OF BANKING PRIVACY PRIOR TO THE
SUPREME COURT DECISION IN MILLER</strong> </p>

<p>Although United States v. Miller subsequently was reversed by
the United States Supreme Court, a discussion of the analysis by
the court of appeals is appropriate.[81] That decision, and a
decision of the California Supreme Court,[82] had held that
although a bank had voluntarily complied with a subpoena, the
depositor's records were inadmissible at trial because the
depositor's legitimate expectation of privacy was violated by
such a disclosure. </p>

<p><strong>A. Defective Grand Jury Subpoena: The Fifth Circuit's
View </strong></p>

<p>In United States v. Miller,[83] a United States Attorney,
without the depositor-defendants knowledge, purported to issue
a grand jury subpoena for &quot;all records of account&quot; in
the depositor's name from two banks in which he had accounts. The
banks voluntarily produced microfilm copies of the depositor's
checks and a deposit slip. These items subsequently were used to
convict him. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit reversed the conviction holding that the defendant's
fourth amendment rights were violated by the search because the
subpoenas were fatally defective. In reaching its decision, the
court maintained that Boyd v. United States [84] applied and that
the government could not circumvent the Boyd doctrine &quot;by
first requiring a third party bank to copy all of its depositors'
personal checks and then, with an improper invocation of legal
process, calling upon the bank to allow inspection and
reproduction of those copies.&quot;[85] The court distinguished
California Bankers Association on the ground that the Supreme
Court, far from &quot;proclaiming open season on personal bank
records,&quot; had relied heavily upon the notion that depositors
were adequately protected because access to those records was
governed by proper legal process.[86] </p>

<p>The Fifth Circuit's rationale in Miller, while not entirely
clear, suggested that the depositor may have had both a
proprietary and a privacy interest in his bank records.[87] In
Harris v. United States,[88] the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit ruled that a check could not be considered a confidential
communication. The judges dissenting from the denial of a
rehearing in Miller cited Harris to support the proposition that
a depositor does not have a cognizable privacy interest to confer
standing under Katz v. United States [89] because a bank customer
is aware that any check he writes will be seen by various bank
personnel, although he expects that access to the check will be
restricted to bank employees.[90] </p>

<p><strong>B. Absence of Legal Process </strong></p>

<p>The California Supreme Court has found a right of privacy
protected by the California Constitution. In Burrows v. Superior
Court, [91] local police had obtained a warrant to search the
office of an attorney suspected of misappropriating his client's
funds. After seizing a large number of documents from the
attorney's office, a detective obtained, without a warrant or any
court process, photostatic copies of financial records from
several banks in which the petitioner maintained accounts. A
motion to suppress the bank records was denied and the depositor
sought a statutory writ of mandamus to compel suppression. The
California Supreme Court held that the accused had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in his bank records, and that the police
had unreasonably interfered with that expectation by obtaining
the records without legal process, thereby rendering the seizure
illegal under California law. The court reasoned that &quot;[a]
bank customer's reasonable expectation is that, absent compulsion
by legal process, the matters he reveals to the bank will be
utilized by the bank only for internal banking
purposes.&quot;[92] </p>

<p>The many federal cases that have denied standing to a
depositor seeking to resist a summons to a third party bank on
fourth amendment grounds were distinguished as involving more
than an informal request for information. In those cases records
were furnished either pursuant to a valid administrative
investigation or in a criminal proceeding in which the courts had
been called upon to enforce a summons. The mere fact that the
bank may have had a proprietary interest in the records was not
regarded as dispositive.[93] The California Supreme Court noted
that &quot;[t]he disclosure by the depositor to the bank is made
for the limited purpose of facilitating the conduct of his
financial affairs; it seems evident that his expectation of
privacy is not diminished by the bank's retention of a record of
such disclosure.&quot;[94] </p>

<p>The court also said that the bank's voluntary relinquishment
of records at police request did not constitute valid consent by
the depositor, since the depositor's right of privacy was at
issue.[95] Additionally, the court was not impressed by the
argument that a bank is a mere depository of records already
circulated in public. The court reasoned: </p>

<p>For all practical purposes, the disclosure by individuals or
business firms of their financial affairs to a bank is not
entirely volitional, since it is impossible to participate in the
economic life of contemporary society without maintaining a bank
account. In the course of such dealings a depositor reveals many
aspects of his personal affairs, opinions, habits and
associations. Indeed, the totality of bank records provides a
virtual current biography . . . . To permit a police officer
access to these records merely upon request, without any judicial
control as to relevancy or other traditional requirements of
legal process..... opens the door to a vast and unlimited range
of very real abuses of police power.[96] </p>

<p>The California Supreme Court declined to reach the question of
fourth amendment rights under the United States Constitution,
granting the motion to suppress based upon the California
Constitution. The court discussed the California Bankers
Association case at some length, and commented that it was
unclear whether its conclusion in Burrows would withstand a
constitutional challenge in the United States Supreme Court.[97] </p>

<p>In both Miller and Burrows, the courts found that intrusions
into the records of bank depositors without valid legal process
were unreasonable. Given the compelling privacy expectations of a
depositor with respect to financial records in the possession of
his bank, as developed in Burrows, it was anticipated that the
use of an administrative summons by the I.R.S. in the future
would be restricted. At the very least, the strong privacy
interest of the depositor was expected to accord him standing to
sue on his own behalf to quash an administrative summons served
on his bank, since it would be neither fair nor reasonable to
compel a depositor to rely upon the bank's attempt to assert his
rights on principles of third party standing. [98] Although it
has been argued that banks should be permitted to take such
action, there is no guarantee that in all instances they would do
so when faced with an administrative inquiry. Against this
backdrop, the Supreme Court considered the government's appeal in
Miller. </p>

<p><strong>V. THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN MILLER AND THE
CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE</strong> </p>

<p>On April 21, 1976, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of
the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Miller, holding that the
bank depositor had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the
contents of checks and deposit slips since the documents were not
confidential communications, but rather were negotiable
instruments voluntarily conveyed to the bank. Moreover, the Court
ruled that the fourth amendment does not prohibit a third party
from obtaining information and conveying it to the
government.[99] The Bank Secrecy Act, which requires that
detailed financial records be kept by banks, was viewed as not
altering these considerations so as to create a protectable
interest.[100] </p>

<p>The Supreme Court followed the old property interest line of
analysis under the fourth amendment and noted that banks have
&quot;a substantial stake in [the] continued availability and
acceptance [of checks]&quot; which are the business records of
the bank.[101] As. a practical matter, a bank has no real
occasion to inspect the transaction underlying a particular
check. The only inspection that occurs is clearly perfunctory to
insure against post-dating and inaccurate endorsements. The vast
bulk of the more than twenty-five billion checks annually cleared
by the American banking system are sorted and posted by data
processing machines. The hearings before enactment of the Bank
Secrecy Act showed that banks do maintain a high level of
confidentiality regarding checking account transactions and are
under a legal duty not to release such information except with
the depositor's approval.[102] Such confidentiality is due to the
long-standing recognition that the information contained in such
records is highly personal.[103] </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Miller decision clearly put to rest any
confusion concerning the availability of the favored
administrative summons for conducting investigations. After
Miller, any I.R.S. agent could complete a section 7602 summons
form and affidavit, present it to a bank, and neither bank nor
depositor could raise any valid objection to the inquiry. As a
result of Miller, the Supreme Court has effectively precluded a
taxpayer from keeping his banking records private. Even though
under present law access to a citizen's checking account records
by private parties is precluded, the government may inspect them
with impunity. </p>

<p>In light of the liberty given to the government to inspect
banking records through the use of administrative summonses, it
is impossible to reconcile Miller with Katz and Griswold. The
observations of Associate Justice Stanley Mosk of the California
Supreme Court in Burrows are particularly compelling: </p>

<p>Cases are legion that condemn violent searches and invasions
of an individual's right to privacy of his dwelling. The
imposition upon privacy, although perhaps not so dramatic, may be
equally devastating when other methods are employed. Development
of photocopying machines, electronic computers and other
sophisticated instruments have accelerated the ability of the
government to intrude into areas which a person normally chooses
to exclude from prying eyes and inquisitive minds. Consequently,
judicial interpretations of the reach of the Constitutional
protection of individual privacy must keep pace with the perils
created by these new devices.[104] </p>

<p>The United States Supreme Court rejected the Katz
&quot;justifiable expectation of privacy&quot; analysis, and
opted for a mechanical &quot;property interest&quot; analysis
which is unwieldy in its application to twentieth century
technology. In the late 1700's there was no concern about the use
of computerized records, central data banks, sophisticated
electronic eavesdropping tools, communication satellites, readily
available photocopying, or the mass use of national indexing
systems such as those provided by social security or drivers'
license numbers.[105 The articulation of rules that clearly are
not adaptable to new technological innovations is folly, unless
the Supreme Court intended to strengthen the investigative powers
of the I.R.S. at the expense of refusing to recognize an idea
whose time had come. As the Burrows analysis shows, the Supreme
Court's decision could easily, and most convincingly, have been
rendered in favor of the framers' understanding of the fourth
amendment. The decision is all the more curious because, while
Miller was under consideration by the Supreme Court, the Tax
Reform Act of 1976 was before Congress, including provisions for
reforming procedures regarding third party summonses. </p>

<p>The Tax Reform Act [106] remedies most of the evils of the
administrative summons. It provides that, in the case of a third
party summons, the taxpayer, or other persons to whom the
summoned records pertain, are to receive notice of the summons
from the I.R.S. within three days of its issuance and to have the
right to stay compliance by notifying the person summoned within
fourteen days not to comply. The I.R.S. then is required to seek
enforcement of the summons in federal court, and the taxpayer has
standing to challenge enforcement, including the right to
intervene in any proceeding seeking enforcement of a summons. In
the case of a John Doe summons,[107] the I.R.S. must go into
court, establish reasonable cause for requesting the summons, and
receive court approval before issuing the summons. </p>

<p>The notice requirement is suspended when a summons is issued
solely to determine if records exist or when notice may result in
a material interference with an investigation. This amendment to
the original House bill was intended to enable the I.R.S. to
avoid material interference with an investigation if it
reasonably believed that an investigation might occur. Petitions
by the I.R.S., however, are not to be granted automatically by
the courts and reasonable cause must be shown. </p>

<p>In addition, the new law provides for suspension of both
criminal and civil statutes of limitations when a notices who
protests enforcement of the summons is either the taxpayer
himself, his nominee or agent, or another person actually under
the direction or control of the taxpayer. A corporation
controlled by the taxpayer, for example, is covered under this
rule. On the other hand, if a third party record-keeper, such as
an attorney, accountant, or a bank, protests enforcement of the
summons, the statute of limitations will not be suspended with
respect to the taxpayer because the third party record-keeper is
not the notices and, presumably, is not under the noticee's
control. </p>

<p><strong>VI. CONCLUSION</strong> </p>

<p>The failure of modern courts to delineate and utilize a
consistent privacy analysis is evidence that the juxtaposition of
traditional property concepts and emerging concepts with respect
to rights of privacy are in a state of change which makes it
necessary to reexamine the ways in which the underlying and
conflicting values become expressed in rules. As one jurist has
noted: </p>

<p>Our nation's current social development harbors insidious
evolutionary forces which propel us toward a collective,
Orwellian society. One of the features of that society is the
utter destruction of privacy, the individual's complete exposure
to the all-seeing, all-powerful police state. Government
agencies, civilian and military, federal, state and local, have
acquired miles and acres of files, enclosing revelations of the
personal affairs and conditions of millions of private
individuals. Credit agencies and other business enterprises
assemble similar collections. Information peddlers burrow into
the crannies of these collections. Microfilm and electronic tape
facilitate the storage of private facts on an enormous scale.
Computers permit automated retrieval, assemblage and
dissemination. These vast repositories of personal information
may easily be assembled into millions of dossiers characteristic
of a police state. Our age is one of shriveled
privacy.&quot;[108] </p>

<p>The opposing views of the United States Supreme Court and
certain state courts, such as the California Supreme Court,
reveal an upheaval in existing law as old rules change to
accommodate new technology. Today's jurists, as they construe the
fourth amendment, must look both to the intent of the framers and
to the technological context in which it was drafted rather than
merely follow a mechanical extension of eighteenth century rules.
The &quot;justifiable expectation of privacy&quot; approach makes
it possible to deal rationally not only with today's but with
tomorrow's technological developments. </p>

<p>60. In Ex parte Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 733 (1877), the
ownership of letters in the mail was noted to be a sufficient
interest to provide constitutional protections (dictum). </p>

<p>61. Prior to Miller, it appeared that five Justices of the
Supreme Court also shared this view. See California Bankers Ass'n
v. Schultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974) (Powell &amp; Blackmun, JJ.,
concurring; Douglas &amp; Marshall, JJ., dissenting; Brennan, J.,
dissenting and concurring with Justice Douglas on depositor's
privacy expectations). The confidentiality of checking account
transactions has long been respected by the banking industry both
in the United States a foreign countries. This was well
documented by the Bank Secrecy Act Hearings and the Bank
Disclosure Hearings, supra note 12. See also cases cited at note
102 infra. </p>

<p>87. Id. at 756-58. This sentiment was expressed by the
dissenting judges on the denial of the rehearing. 508 F.2d 588,
590-95 (1975) (Simpson, J., dissenting). If this decision does
rest on a depositor's proprietary interest, standing may not be
the real issue. Rather, the depositor's right to object to the
evidentiary use of illegally seized records simply represents an
aspect of the exclusionary rule. </p>

authorize transactions solely through the use of a number,
symbol, code name or other device not involving the disclosure of
his identity. A person maintaining the account includes the
person who established it and any person authorized to use the
account or to receive records or statements. </p>

<hr>

<p>For the past twenty years, the FAA has been passing regulations restricting where pilots can fly. The FAA claims its sole 
purpose is to make flying safer, but FAA rule making clearly has been designed to protect the government from liability. The 
end result is an unnecessarily complex system that requires the most detailed working knowledge of airspace regulations from 
part-time private pilots.</p>
<p>Avoiding mid-air collisions between commercial flights and private aircraft requires pilots of both types of planes readily 
understand and follow a system of easily comprehensible rules. It is a goal that can be achieved by having simple rules that are 
easily understood and followed by every pilot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today's system has been made extremely simple for the professional and well-trained airline pilot who operates 
aircraft by instruments under the instrument flight rules (IFR) and very complicated for the general aviation pilot flying under 
visual flight rules (VFR). </p>
<p>The present regulatory scheme has evolved slowly, but the most drastic revisions came in response to spectacular accidents in 
which the FAA was sued. </p>
<p>For example, today's requirement that all aircraft flying between 18,000 and 60,000 feet above sea level must adhere to an 
IFR flight plan resulted from the collision of two airliners over the Grand Canyon on June 30, 1956 when a United Airlines 
Dc-7 and a TWA Constellation that killed 128 people. </p>
<p>On December 16, 1960, a United Airlines DC-8 and a TWA Constellation collided over Staten Island killing 134 and 
resulted in the rule that ordered slower aircraft speeds near airports and mandatory radar on airlines. On September 25, 
1978, a Pacific Southwest Airways Boeing 727 collided with a single engine Cessna 172 over San Diego killing 144, while 
both aircraft were under FAA radar control and operating with prescribed clearances. That crash accelerated the FAA's 
airspace restriction efforts. </p>
<p>On August 31, 1986 in the Cerritos tragedy, a Piper Archer without clearance crossed the path of an Aeromexico DC-9 jet 
within the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area, killing 82 and helped stiffen governmental attitudes toward traffic rule 
enforcement. </p>
<p>The 1987 crash of a PSA flight over Paso Robles, Califoria resulted in increased scrutiny of all persons, including crew 
members, accessing aircraft gateways, after a deranged employeee smuggled a gun onboard the PSA flight, shot the crew in 
flight and killed 43. [See <a href="http://alexanderlaw.com/injury/record.html#$1,732,500">The Alexander Law Firm: Track Record of Success</a> for details on the PSA disaster.] </p>
<p>Because the system has been designed in response to crises, it is a patchwork that places the heaviest working load on private 
pilots, as opposed to professional airline pilots, while ignoring the fact that the overall safety of the system heavily relies upon 
the non-professional pilot. Private pilots must maintain a safe distance from commercial aircraft, and at the same time perform 
a myriad of chores that make the airline pilot's job easy in comparison. </p>
<p>The extremely heavy workload placed on private pilots by the FAA makes little sense. Private pilots, as a practical matter, 
have to immediately recall, and be able to instantly and correctly apply, far more FAA rules and regulations than their airline 
counterparts. It is a system that screams for simplicity to maximize safety, but the FAA's response has been to protect itself 
and continually increase the complexity of an already over-complex system of regulations. </p>
<p>The following example typifies how the system works today. Imagine yourself at the controls of a private airplane approaching 
Palo Alto Airport from Sacramento at night, flying under visual flight rules. You are called by the controller just as the lights of 
a large jet pop out of the bottom of the overcast off your left wingtip. Every word after your call sign is blanketed by an ear- 
splitting squeal caused by another pilot's accidentally transmitting at the same time the controller speaks.</p>
<p>You must instantly apply the Federal Aviation Regulations, FAA Advisory Circulars, your airplane's FAA approved Pilot's 
Operating Handbook, the basic rules of flight learned in primary training and keep in mind the multiple sections of regulated 
airspace on the San Francisco Sectional Aeronautical Chart. At the same time, please continue your heading, controlling for 
the southerly winds and mild turbulence caused by the hills below, maintain your altitude, keep your wings level, and look for 
navigation lights in the dark from other airplanes on your left, right and coming straight at you from your Palo Alto destination. 
Now, what did that controller tell you to do? Is there a hazard present that you cannot see?</p>
<p>This is not a game, but a real, high stakes test of FAA's regulatory system, designed to provide safe flight for both the airlines' 
passengers and yours. It all boils down to the decisions you are about to make as a private pilot.</p>
<p>To safely complete this flight you must obey the right-of-way rules, maintain the proper legal distance from clouds and ground, 
remain clear of the San Francisco Terminal Control Area, the Oakland Airport Radar Service Area, and the Hayward and 
Moffett Airport Traffic Areas. You must provide your own navigation to your destination and monitor the Automatic Terminal 
Information Service broadcast for Palo Alto to know which approach and runway to use, the wind direction, and the correct 
setting for your altimeter, while remembering the ATIS identification code word so you can repeat it to the Palo Alto Tower to 
prove you heard the broadcast. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the controller still awaits an answer to the call placed to you. None of this is training. While it may quicken your 
pulse and accelerate your breathing, this situation is a typical flight situation you experience as an FAA approved private pilot. </p>
<p>To earn the right to fly under visual flight rules as a private pilot, your training could have consisted of as little as 20 hours of 
flight instruction, 20 hours of solo flight practice, correctly answering 35 of 50 multiple choice questions on a written test, and 
passing an on-the-ground oral quiz and a flight test. Your pilot's certificate is good for life. It entitles you to fly a piston- 
powered single engine airplane of U.S. registry weighing less than 12,500 pounds anywhere on earth, as long as you do not 
carry passengers or property for hire. </p>
<p>Tonight, to preserve your night vision, you dim the cockpit lights to provide the minimum illumination for your map, properly 
called a Sectional Aeronautical Chart, issued by the National Ocean Survey every six months. It is complicated to read 
because, in addition to picturing hills and mountains, it is also a crazy-quilt diagram of Federal Aviation Regulations. The 
magenta and blue tint bands mark areas known as controlled airspace. In these areas, you must avoid clouds by staying 500 
feet below, 1000 feet above, and by keeping a horizontal distance of 2,000 feet. In addition, you must have at least three 
miles of visibility mandated by the visual flight rules or else you cannot fly or land here. The blue arcs of airspace that fan out 
from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) are segments of the San Francisco Terminal Control Area which requires 
special aircraft equipment and special controller approval prior to entry. The braided magenta ropes about the Alameda Naval 
Air Station, Oakland, and Hayward Airports are the Oakland Radar Service Area, a special zone that requires two-way 
radio communication with Approach Control before penetration. Hayward, Oakland, Alameda, and San Jose airports are 
individually surrounded by broken blue lines to mark the presence of Control Zones where special rules apply. SFO also has 
a control zone marked with a circle formed of T's which tells you that with a special clearance you cannot operate an airplane 
here if there is only one mile of visibility, if clear of clouds (cloud separation rules of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 feet do not apply). 
You must pay special attention to airports depicted in blue. If the tower is operating, you must establish radio communications 
from five miles away if you are landing or flying lower than 3,000 feet. Do not look for the five mile boundary of the Airport 
Traffic Area; it is for you to estimate. The yellow areas on the map area purely cultural, showing the light pattern of ground 
settlement as seen from the air at night. </p>
<p>Since it is a moonless night, you have planned your flight route carefully to avoid nearly invisible unlit terrain. To make certain 
of your position, you have chosen to fly along the 177 degree course from the Sacramento VOR (very high frequency omni- 
directional range), a radio navigation transmitter, until intercepting the 210 degree course to the Woodside VOR on the hill 
behind Palo Alto Airport. If clouds have formed since you left Sacramento or fog has settled, flight law requires you to deviate 
on your own judgment, remaining clear of clouds and ground. </p>
<p>Add one more complication, intermittent rain has begun to splatter your windshield, making ground lights seem wavy and 
fractured as the windstream blows the water across the windshield. That large airliner on your left is descending on a crossing 
course and will be far to your right in Oakland by the time you intercept the wake of heavy turbulent whirlwinds that trail 
below the large jet as it plows through the air toward Oakland. It is an invisible hazard you must stay below or risk 
encountering violent turbulence, which is always dangerous, but especially so at low altitude. </p>
<p>The rain has become stronger to your right and the green and white beacon that marks the Hayward Air Terminal seven miles 
away has just disappeared from view. &quot;Am I still legal (VFR)?&quot; crosses your mind. At the same time, you continue to scan left, 
center, and right for small aircraft lights, carefully control your altitude, bring the wings back to level as the airplane buffets in 
the light turbulence caused by the incoming weather, keep an eye on the heading displayed on your directional gyro and your 
engine instruments, while your ear is tuned to the hum of the engine and the radio as you await an interruption in the radio 
traffic to report to the controller that the primary advice was not received due to radio interference. </p>
<p>In short, there is a lot going on in your cockpit, especially compared to the same scene from the cockpit of the passing airliner. 
Its captain is required to fly the Boeing under instrument rules solely by reference to the instrument panel, along the V-107 
airway, by staying at the published altitude. The captain's environment is serene because there is little to do except to monitor 
and control one visual display, called a flight director, that maintains heading through the use of an electronic piloting system. In 
the right seat, the co-pilot, also a fully qualified holder of an Airline Transport Pilot certificate, is tuning the navigation radios, 
communicating with the controller, monitoring landing information for Oakland International, and managing the jet's engine 
power. There is little else for the pilot to do because the flight has remained under the direct supervision of ground controllers 
since leaving Chicago. Across the country, the airliner has been on instrument flight rules, flying a pre-arranged route at 
specified altitudes and enjoying radar escort services by ground controllers and direct communications on special radio 
frequencies warning of any potential air traffic in the craft's vicinity. </p>
<p>The crew's navigational responsibility is to comply with the terms of the IFR clearance received before leaving Chicago. Those 
terms advised the crew of the exact route and altitudes assigned by the FAA's computer system. The crew's job is simply to 
follow the FAA's orders so the controllers can keep track of the jet across the United States. Should the jetliner's 
communication radios fail after takeoff, the clearance will take it from O'Hare all the way to 200 feet above the landing 
threshold on Runway 29 at Oakland without ever looking out the window; if the white approach lights are visible just short of 
the runway's end, the plan can descend another 100 feet. Finally, once the red bars on the light array appear, the plane is 
cleared all the way to the ground. </p>
<p>The workload in comparison to the private pilot is extraordinarily free from complexity. For pilots who do all their flying within 
the IFR system, the private pilot's VFR map is irrelevant. In fact, the IFR system is so protective of commercial aircraft, and 
many of the VFR restrictions so new, that many senior airline captains have never flown under the visual rules in Terminal 
Control areas and Airport Radar Service Areas. </p>
<p>Put yourself back in the small airplane's cockpit. The jet is now well off to your right. You are descending rapidly to get below 
the 2,500 feet floor of the San Francisco Terminal Control Area, which is reserved for instrument traffic. The radio crackles 
with your call sign, &quot;I say again. Radar Service terminated. Remain clear of the San Francisco Terminal Control Area. 
Squawk 1200. Good evening.&quot; </p>
<p>After acknowledging, you dial 1200 into your encoding altimeter so radar in the Bay Area will show you flying VFR and you 
switch to your second radio which you have pre-set for the Palo Alto Tower, announce your location and confirm that you 
earlier listened to the automatic weather broadcast by repeating that hour's special code word. </p>
<p>Time to retard the throttle and slow down to 156 knots, the maximum speed for entering an Airport Traffic Area. Who, pray 
tell, picked this peculiar number to be the speed limit? The map has been replaced with your written pre-landing checklist and, 
after you extend the landing gear, you perform each of the items on the list. All good pilots read the printed checklist, while 
scanning for unannounced traffic and watching for announced aircraft enroute to the airport. You enter the landing pattern 
heading downwind behind a small Cessna and slow down to maintain separation, turn on the base leg, then another 90 degree 
turn onto final approach for a landing, having completed a half hour's flight that saved you a two hour drive. </p>
<p>The last ten minutes of that flight required you to recall and apply virtually all the knowledge you acquired in your training. And 
to get it right the first time. </p>
<p>At Oakland, the Boeing has whistled up to the gate. The captain and first officer are already in the crew bus headed for their 
hotel. They too have had a routine flight. Leaving Chicago, they were in clouds most of the time until they reached 18,000 feet 
and entered the FAA's Positive Control Airspace where they remained under direct FAA supervision for the length of the trip. 
The autopilot worked well, maintaining the ship's heading and altitude and re-balancing the wings to keep the airliner level. On 
descent, the crew entered clouds at 19,000 feet and stayed in them until breaking out of the bottom in wispy stratus and light 
rain 14 miles east of Oakland. Throughout the flight, separation from other aircraft and correct altitude was constantly assured 
by an FAA controller. Once the Boeing broke out of the cloud deck, the co- pilot saw the lights of a half dozen planes, the 
closest already pre-announced by the radar-equipped approach controller, but all well below the protected TCA airspace 
reserved for IFR aircraft. Together pilot and co-pilot completed the Boeing's pre-landing checklist on their straight in landing 
at Oakland. </p>
<p>The FAA's system worked well, but it strategically relies upon the least trained pilots in the sky to honor all the rules, all the 
time, to make sure the skies are safe for the traveling public. </p>
<p>That's why it's time to overhaul and simplify the rules for visual flight. Simple rules will decrease the workload on the private 
pilot, and the result will be increased compliance, reliability and safety for everyone. </p>

<hr>


<p>On Friday, May 29, 1981, the nation's press reported an $8.5 million settlement paid by Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) for a sixteen year old San Jose 
boy, Steven Throop. </p>
<p>Thirteen year old Steven suffered severe electrical burns on July 4, 1978 when he climbed upon a boxcar parked on Conrail's mainline in Washington, D.C. The 
accident happened within yards of the National Air and Space Museum and the Smithsonian Institute. </p>
<p>Accidents like Steve Throop's are not new to Conrail, a quasi-federal corporation created to handle freight by the authority of the Regional Rail Reorganization 
Act of 1973. </p>
<p>On average, 24 deaths/major injuries per year have been suffered by children as a result of Conrail's overhead electrical catenary system and the failure of the 
Federal Railroad Administration to demand appropriate warnings and fencing systems. </p>
<p>Despite Washington, D.C.'s strict rule of contributory negligence, which precludes anyone who contributes to their accident in any way from recovering, thereby 
insuring a virtual absolute defense for the railroad, why did Conrail pay? </p>
<p>On April 1, 1976, Conrail took over the Northeast's railway network comprising seven bankrupt railroads, headed by Penn Central, including all transportation 
properties, equipment and existing employees. Passenger service was delegated to a separate corporation, the National Rail Passenger Corporation, Amtrak. On 
May 19, 1976 Conrail contracted with Amtrak to operate the electrical catenary system which provides electrical power for electrically operated trains. </p>
<p>Virtually every employee of Conrail and Amtrak today began with either the Pennsylvania RR or with the Penn Central, the successor to Pennsylvania and New 
York Central merger in 1968. Accident such as the one permanently disabling Throop are not new to these employees. </p>
<p>Since the Northeast Corridor electrification project was completed with WPA money in 1934, children have been killed and maimed at a regular rate. </p>
<p>On April 20, 1970, the New York Times carried a fifteen inch story headlined &quot;Measures Urged to Halt Electrocutions in Rail Yard.&quot; The story reported eleven 
cases of severe injuries and deaths to children 9 to 14 years of age who climbed railroad equipment and contacted the overhead catenary system. Penn-Central 
employees were quoted at length by the Times concerning the hazards of the catenary system. </p>
<p>On May 14, 1971, in Washington, D.C., 14 year old Preston Morris was killed and his rescuer, Metropolitan Police Officer Raymond Zilko, permanently 
disabled in an accident identical to Throop and which occurred at the same location as the Throop accident. </p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board, whose offices overlook the accident location, conducted an in-depth investigation of the May 14th accident. In its 
March 29, 1972 report, the NTSB stated: &quot;There are few effective warning indicators in an around the accident area and no barriers that would discourage 
trespassers. Compounding the hazard in the area is a parking lot on which children congregate to play. There are no positive separation barriers between the 
railroad and the parking lot.&quot; </p>
<p>The report also noted that the sole sign, a faded &quot;No Trespassing&quot; legend stenciled on the catenary poles in the immediate vicinity of the accident, was 
&quot;inconspicuous and marginally legible, did not contain specific warnings of the types of hazards present and therefore had no hazard warning effect.&quot; </p>
<p>Following the Morris-Zilko accident, no changes were ever made in the property by the railroad. No new signs or fences were erected by the railroad. </p>
<p>In November of 1971, the Department of Transportation, in a Report to Congress entitled &quot;Railroad-Highway Safety, Part 1: A comprehensive Statement of the 
Problem&quot; stated: &quot;Catenaries are the overhead wiring system used to carry energy to electric locomotives. Catenary accidents may or may not involve trains. All 
of the catenary accidents in the sample data involved juveniles and all resulted in serious injury or death. Minor catenary accidents are rare because all of them 
result in severe electric shock, and there is a strong probability that a fall from the top of a boxcar will follow.&quot; </p>
<p>The report went on to conclude: &quot;While there may be a general awareness of dangers associated with catenary systems as with power lines, few people outside 
the railroad industry are aware that the electrical potential is so great that shocks can result without actual contacting of the wire.&quot; [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>The same report recommended installation of warning signs easily understood by juveniles which would indicate the potential hazard. &quot;For example, a catenary 
warning could depict a stick figure on top of a boxcar below the catenary with a lightning bolt between the wire and the child,&quot; the report suggested. </p>
<p>In April 1975 the U.S. Department of Transportation presented its final report on the Northeast Corridor High Speed Rail Passenger Service Improvement 
Project, Task 10S, Grade Crossings and Fencings. The report contains the proposed catenary caution signs earlier suggested, which follow international signing 
standards. </p>
<p>The proposed signs designed by the Department of Transportation have never been adopted by the railroad. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Conrail and its predecessors have for years taken extensive precautions when their employees are required to work in the vicinity of the 
catenary wires. The railroad's Electrical Operating Rules, known as C.T. 290, prohibit any employee from getting upon, riding upon or working upon the roofs of 
any freight car or engine while it is under the energized catenary system. </p>
<p>The hazard potential is so extreme that &quot;after the catenary system has been de-energized and grounded over cars on which persons are to engage in loading and 
unloading material, all such persons must be warned to regard all the overhead wires as energized and that they must not allow their bodies or material of any kind 
to come within . . . three feet of the catenary system . . . wires. . . .&quot; according to the Electrical Operating Rules. </p>
<p>In April, 1978 Conrail was well aware of the open, easy access to its right-of-way at the accident location in Washington. Mr. Frank DiBonaventuro, Assistant 
Manager for Real Estate for Conrail, wrote the Washington, D.C. Redevelopment Authority concerning the railroad's property located between 6th and 7th 
Streets, S.W.: &quot;Recent inspection of the subject property indicates you are presently subletting our property to a parking operator without the benefit of an 
agreement from Conrail,&quot; stated Mr. DiBonaventuro. &quot;We are aware this condition existed prior to the conveyance from Penn Central to Conrail. . . .&quot; </p>
<p>Aerial photographs taken during the spring of 1978 and on-site photographs taken following the Throop accident show that the parking lot in question, Paul's 
Parking operated by Paul Hinzman of Oxen Hill, Maryland, routinely parked cars, vans, campers and motorhomes adjacent to the catenary poles, within feet of 
Conrail's tracks. </p>
<p>Mr. Fred McGrath, who operates Almac Parking, a neighbor of Hinzman's lot, testified in deposition that during the summer months the number of children in the 
area increases because of the nearby museums, and that it is not uncommon to see trains parked on the railroad tracks. Employees of the parking lots reported 
that children would regularly play in the area where the trains were parked, they could be seen climbing on cars and other children had been hurt playing on 
boxcars at the same location. </p>
<p>On July 4, 1978, Steven Throop, age 13, visited Washington with family friends The group parked their motorhome at 7th and C. Streets, S.W. in Paul's Parking 
Lot, directly adjacent to Conrail's mainline. The railroad tracks at that location run near the National Air and Space Museum on the Capitol Mall. Trains were 
parked on the mainline due to the regular closing for the 4th of July holiday of the Potomac Yard in nearby Virginia. </p>
<p>Even though the electrical wires over Conrail's tracks were not in use that day due to the closing of the Potomac Yard, the electrical power remained on. At other 
locations Conrail on occasion would de-energize the catenary when a train would be parked on the tracks in order to avoid injuries to children known to paly in 
the area, testified Charles D. Shertzer of Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, a power director supervisor of the catenary system for Amtrak. </p>
<p>On the day of the accident, Conrail Police Officer Finice McCabe, noting the heavy 4th of July traffic in downtown Washington, D.C., specifically asked Conrail 
management to de-energize the catenary wires in order to avoid injuries to members of the public who would be on Conrail property to watch a fireworks display 
on the Capitol Mall. His request was denied because it was &quot;regular operating procedure to keep the power on all the time.&quot; Joseph Gannon, Conrail tower 
operator testified. </p>
<p>The accident occurred when Throop and his playmate Robert Baum, age 13 of Lodi, California climbed a standing car which had been parked on the mainline 
waiting for the Potomac Yard to open the next day. </p>
<p>Baum stood atop the car and climbed down without injury. For Throop it was a different story. He climbed up next and contacted a 12,000 volt overhead 
catenary wire used to provide power for Conrail's engines. </p>
<p>The electrical current so severely cooked his right [major] arm and both legs that amputation was required. Dr. Carlos Silva of the Washington Medical Center 
Burn Unit reported that Throop's were among the worst burn injuries he had ever seen as Chief of Services for the burn unit. </p>
<p>Suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, before Judge Thomas A. Flannery, in 1978. </p>
<p>On May 27, 1981 Judge Edward Panelli of the Santa Clara County Superior Court approved an $8.5 million settlement, at the request of Throop's mother and 
guardian, Juanita Throop. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding this horrendous accident history, Conrail and Amtrak have never installed any warning signs at this or any other accident location. </p>
<p>That such precautions should be taken is evidenced by a special computer print-out prepared by the Federal Railroad Administration. </p>
<p>An exhaustive search of more than 3,000 pages of F.R.A. regular reports of train accidents failed to reveal any electrical accidents. This was unusual since all 
railroad accidents must be reported to the F.R.A. When F.R.A. officials were queried it was learned that no print-out had been made &quot;because no one had ever 
asked for this information.&quot; Although it still remained within the F.R.A.'s computer bank. </p>
<p>A special program was written by mr. Stanley Ellis (at the request of Throop's lawyers) which showed that during the three and one-half years preceding the 
injury to Throop, 89 similar accidents had occurred. Virtually all involved children climbing on standing equipment. The average age was 13.5 years. All injuries 
resulted in death or catastrophic maiming. Each of those 89 accidents had been reported to the F.R.A. by the Penn-Central, Conrail and Amtrak under F.R.A. 
regulations. </p>
<p>At a minimum, one would expect Conrail and Amtrak to take some preventative steps. None have ever been forthcoming. Conrail press relations officer Wilson 
will report &quot;off the record&quot; that no changes will take place even after the Throop settlement. </p>
<p>This is not surprising since no efforts have been made to upgrade or to otherwise maintain the property from a safety viewpoint since its original construction in 
1934, notwithstanding the federal government's reports and the continuing accidents. </p>
<p>This summer another ten to twelve children will be killed or maimed because Conrail has decided to pursue a corporate policy of indifference to the hazard 
presented to the public by the catenary system. </p>
<p>It has elected to defend lawsuits as they occur since wrongful death suits on behalf of parents for the loss of a child rarely present any extreme financial exposure 
to the railroad. The only real exposure exists in cases of catastrophic injuries such as suffered by Steve Throop. </p>
<p>&quot;Conrail's position is that it was not liable and the accident was caused by a boy trespassing on their property,&quot; said Eben Crawford of Squires, Sanders and 
Dempsey in Cleveland, Ohio, according to The Peninsula Times Tribune. Crawford also stated in the same interview: &quot;It was the judgment made by Conrail it was 
in the best interest to settle the case,&quot; [sic] refusing to elaborate further. That obviously is the case. </p>
<p>Conrail's corporate policy decision is identical to that made by Ford with regard to installing safety devices in gas tanks. Ford calculated, in the now famous Grush 
memo to the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that the $137 million cost of installing safety devices in gas tanks outweighed paying $49.5 million for 
settlements in cases of deaths and burns caused by unprotected tanks. </p>
<p>It took untold hours to investigate the facts behind Steven Throop's case. In light of the overwhelming evidence, Conrail agreed to settle the Throop claim for the 
sum of $8.5 million. While this may appear to be a large amount of money no one should doubt for a minute that Steven Throop would rather have two good legs 
and two good arms rather than the three stumps he is left with. </p>
<p>If this were to be the last such accident, then the settlement in Steven Throop's case would truly be a victory, but unfortunately that is not the case. </p>
<p>Children will continue to be killed and maimed by this arrogant giant because it simply lacks the social conscience to do what is right. </p>
<p>Conrail continues to hide behind antiquated laws, lumbering through the 20th century with all the concern of a 19th century robber baron. </p>
<p>Only if concerned citizens demand that their legislatures take action to require Conrail to erect the warning signs designed by the federal government and in high 
density areas maintain proper fencing, catastrophic injuries such as suffered by Steven Throop will be drastically reduced. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size=5>O</font>n April 15, 1996, Chrysler Corporation, facing a barrage of consumer complaints, a government investigation and a class 
action lawsuit, agreed to fix 275,000 1991-93 minivans [Caravan C-V, Dodge Caravan, Grand Voyager, and Town and 
Country], 67,000 Chrysler New Yorkers, Imperials and Dynasties, and 4,000 1991-92 Earle Premier and Dodge Monacos 
with Bendix ABS brakes manufactured by AlliedSignal. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he Bendix 10 ABS system utilizes a hydraulic pump that is erratic and results in reduced braking power assistance that 
causes a wide range of &quot;unusual&quot; responses under different braking conditions. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s part of its agreement, Chrysler will repair, free of charge, defective ABS brakes, will extend the warranty to 100,000 
miles on ABS brake parts, and will &quot;buy back&quot; from owners the cost of previous brake repairs. The terms of the 
&quot;reimbursement&quot; program are still being negotiated. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he agreement to pay owners for money they were induced into paying for repairs to defective vehicle is a key provision of 
the class action lawsuit Chrysler has been defending and has precedence in the 1994 buy back of 33,000 minivans by Nissan 
at an estimated cost of $200,000,000. 1987-90 Nissan minivans had been the subject of three recalls because of engine 
failures and fires before The Alexander Law Firm filed suit in April 1993. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>n February 2, 1994, one week before the hearing on plaintiff's motion to certify a national class action, Nissan negotiated a 
settlement of the class action, stipulated to the certification of a national class, and resolved a federal investigation by the 
National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration by voluntarily agreeing to the first known buy back of defective vehicles, 
in this case 33,000 vans at fair market value [$5,000 to $7,000]. For additional details see Johnson v.Nissan Motor 
Company Inc., U.S.A., Santa Clara County Superior Court No. 730558. Wall Street Journal, February 4, 1994, page A2. 
San Jose Mercury, C1, San Francisco Chronicle, A5. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n November, 1995 The Alexander Law Firm of San Jose, California and Berman, Devallerio, Pease &amp; Tabacco of San 
Francisco filed Villarreal v. Chrysler. Santa Clara CV 753706 arising from the sale or lease of thousands of vehicles 
manufactured by Chrysler Corporation from 1990 through 1995 which are equipped with defective anti-lock brake systems 
which can cause the brakes to unpredictably fail when the brake pedal is depressed. These defective ABS systems were 
manufactured by the Bendix division of the AlliedSignal Corporation, and are commonly known as the &quot;Bendix 10 ABS.&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>ll of the Chrysler vehicles which contain these defective ABS systems were sold or leased with express and implied 
warranties. These warranties assured consumers that these Chrysler vehicles were free from defects and were properly 
equipped for the use for which they were intended. In violation of these warranties, the Chrysler vehicles were equipped with 
defective ABS systems that were prone to failure. By equipping its vehicles with the defective Bendix 10 ABS systems, 
Chrysler breached its express and implied warranties. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>efendant Chrysler has been aware of the serious problems with its Bendix 10 ABS system for years, and has known of the 
possible injuries and deaths that could result from ABS brake failure. Since early 1990, and perhaps even earlier, Chrysler 
began to receive numerous complaints and requests for brake repairs by consumers. Indeed, internal Chrysler memorandum, 
written by Chrysler's senior staff supervisor Rick Cortright, state that Chrysler has seen an increase in consumer calls about 
the Bendix 10 system. </p>
<p><font size=5>N</font>otwithstanding notice of the defect, Chrysler, until April 15, 1996, has denied any obligation to its customers in all of its 
public statements and in its defense of this class action. Rather than honor its warranties, Chrysler has sought to forestall 
complaints arising from Bendix 10 ABS brakes through a deliberate and active public relations campaign of 
misrepresentations. </p>
<p><font size=5>R</font>ather than admitting to the defects in these vehicles, and seeking to repair them, Chrysler has repeatedly denied that the 
Bendix 10 ABS systems are prone to failure and has affirmatively misled its consumers with respect to the safety of its 
vehicles. Fortunately that has now changed. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s a result of Chrysler's previous failure to respond to consumer complaints, many consumers complained to various 
consumer or governmental groups, including the Center for Auto Safety (&quot;CAS&quot;) and National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (&quot;NHTSA&quot;). Virtually thousands of such complaints have been received by NHTSA, leading to its ongoing 
investigation into the ABS systems in various minivan and other car models manufactured by Chrysler. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he class action lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County is not a personal injury case. Plaintiffs and members of the Class brought 
this action for equitable relief to require Chrysler, at its expense, to warn all California consumers of the defects in its ABS 
systems and to require Chrysler, at its expense, to retrofit all vehicles with ABS in California before the brake systems fail and 
injure more people. Under Chrysler's announced action, some of the damage done by Chrysler will be corrected, but partially, 
incompletely and not for all owners. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>hrough this class action lawsuit, Plaintiffs, and members of the Class, have demanded that Chrysler be compelled to recall 
and retrofit all vehicles manufactured between 1990 and 1995 which contained Bendix 10 ABS system, be ordered to 
replace the existing Bendix 10 ABS systems with a non-defective braking system and pay restitution of all costs incurred by 
Plaintiffs in connection with the replacement or repair of the Bendix 10 ABS systems installed in their vehicles. The class 
action also seeks economic damages for the diminution in value of Chrysler vehicles and punitive damages to ensure that 
Chrysler never again callously disregards the safety of its customers and the public. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he complaint is based on Chrysler's breach of its written warranty and the implied warranty provisions of California's 
Uniform Commercial Code, breach of the implied warranty and fitness provisions of California's Song-Beverly Consumer 
Warranty Act, unfair and fraudulent business practices under California Business and Professions Code &#167;&#167;17200 et seq., 
negligent misrepresentation, and equitable relief. </p>
<p>As further information develops, we will post it here. <!--
    <FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>ecause Chrysler's announcement extends only to certain 1991 to
1993 models years and does not include all relief demanded by the class,
the class action will continue to assure all owners full and complete
restitution and repairs.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>wners of 1990-95 Chrysler cars, vans and recreational vehicles
have reported mysterious brake failures in which the brake pedal would not
respond to foot pressure; brakes seemed to work normally at slow speeds but
failed at speeds higher than about 25-30 MPH; the ABS warning light would
come on on briefly and then go out; and partial and complete brake
failures.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>thers have complained of flashing warning lights, odd sounds, rear
brake lockup, front brake lockup, stiff brake pedal, soft brake pedal,
smoking brakes, loss of power assistance in braking, partial loss of
braking, brake pedal going to the floor with little or not braking, and
total loss of braking without warning.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>any failures involve fluid leaking from the ABS hydraulic
components, which are expensive to repair but relatively easy to diagnose.
But many other ABS failures occur intermittently, and mechanics cannot
reproduce them. Intermittent failures should be recorded in the ABS
computer chip, but are not, making it difficult or impossible to diagnose
the malfunction.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>BS is designed so that even if it fails, a vehicle's regular
brakes remain operable. But this safeguard is failing with some Chrysler
vehicles. When ABS fails, many drivers say regular brakes fail as well.
Chrysler denies this, but drivers confirm it sometimes happens.

<h2><a name="title">GMC ABS Brake Investigation</a></h2>
<h4>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h4>
<hr>
<p><font size=5>R</font>e: 1992 - 1995 GMC AND CHEVROLET SUBURBANS</p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>o you have any problems with your brakes? This includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Poor brake pedal feel, or unusual brake pedal travel </li>
<li>Excessive front brake pad wear (less than 30,000 miles) </li>
<li>Unexplained bad stopping </li>
<li>Sliding through intersections </li>
<li>Excessive front tire wear </li>
<li>Slow stopping or the feeling that you won't stop in time. </li>
</ul>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f you have any of these problems or others with your brakes, you may have the same problem that others have with the Kelsey 
Hayes anti-lock brake system (ABS). </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>nother problem is that you may not be aware of all the limitations of the ABS. These limitations also include: </p>
<ul>
<li>ABS can increase stopping distance </li>
<li>ABS can increase stopping distances over non-ABS in certain snow and gravel road situations </li>
<li>The ABS stops operating at 4 mph when stopping </li>
<li>The ABS does not start operating until 8 mph </li>
<li>This system is one of the slowest if not the slowest system available </li>
<li>This system is allegedly not comparable to other GM systems </li>
</ul>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) is also reportedly investigating complaints of poor 
braking in GMC/Chevrolet Suburbans. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s part of our investigation we welcome hearing from you. Would you please complete the following questionnaire? The

<p>It is a strong but true statement that tires are designed to explode when being installed on wheels and for that reason, every tire 
explosion that occurs during the installation process, whether a passenger or light truck tire, is predictable and preventable result 
of a known design defect. </p>
<p>This design defect has been known since 1955 when Firestone engineers publicly confirmed that the failure of the bead during 
mounting of the tire commonly occurs in a predictable location and recommended a simple method to avoid failure. </p>
<p>The tire industry has vigorously litigated explosion claims and industry lawyers have succeeded in defeating cases of serious 
injuries and wrongful deaths caused by defective tires by overwhelming inexperienced tire litigators. </p>
<p>The history of this fraud on the American public is important for consumers and their lawyers to understand. </p>
<p><strong>Tire Bead Design</strong> </p>
<p>The traditional manufacturing process imbeds five steel piano wires in parallel in a continuous rubber tape or ribbon, which 
loosely secures the wires in a soft insulating rubber. The ribbon is wound into a hoop, commonly made of five courses. The end 
result is a grommet composed of a bundle or stack of wires. A cross-cut view of the bead grommet shows a stacking of wires, 
five high and five wires across, also known as a five by five stack. </p>
<p>The key to understanding this foundation for the automobile tire carcass and the role that it plays in explosions, is that this bead 
bundle or grommet has ten cut wire ends: five at the inside cut edge, or at the beginning of the bead wrap, and five on the outside 
cut edge, at the end of the bead wrap. Assuming the inside cut edge, or starting of the bead bundle, to be positioned at the 
twelve o'clock position, a clockwise wrap of the bead ribbon would result in the outside cut edge being found at the one o'clock 
position. This area of overlap between the twelve and one o'clock position is called the bead splice. </p>
<p><strong>Identical Failure Modes</strong> </p>
<p>Virtually every tire bead failure occurs in the location of bead splice at the inside cut edge of the five wires that start the bead. </p>
<p>Each of these strong wires, commonly .037 inches in diameter, is individually capable of holding 300 pounds and separated into 
two well constructed beads, these wires can easily hold 7 tons of air pressure, providing they are all carrying an equal load. </p>
<p>But when the wires in the grommet become unstabilized and distorted the combined strength of the bead grommet is lost. 
Preventable distortion can occur when the bead is being seated onto the rim of a drop center wheel. The drop center, or smaller 
interior portion of the wheel, is the feature which allows a tire to be button-holed over the outer rim flange. Drop centers are 
found on every passenger and light truck wheel. [Heavy duty truck tires, which because of their extreme stiffness, cannot be 
button-holed and these style tires use split or multi-rim wheels in which the outer rim flange on one side of the wheel is 
detachable. In mounting these tires, the rim flange is detached, the tire placed on the wheel, the outer rim is re-attached and then 
the tire is inflated. There is no button-holing in this process.] </p>
<p>When a tire is mounted on a drop center wheel, its beads are forced on by inflationary air pressure within the tire from the drop 
center well of the wheel onto and against the vertical surfaces of the rim flanges by proceeding outward and sliding up a ramp 
where the beads are said to &quot;seat&quot; in their final resting position against the rim flange. Distortion in the bead grommet naturally 
occurs in this process if the area of the bead splice happens to be the last portion of the bead to seat. One explanation for this 
fact is that a splice, by definition, is always a weakest point and prone to separation and distortion. </p>
<p>In the process the grommet of wires, or bead bundle, will separate into a configuration where not all 25 wires in the bead bundle 
are carrying an equal load. The wires forming the grommet can then become separated and only one wire can end up carrying 
the full inflation load of the pressurized tire. </p>
<p><i>If by chance </i>the unstabilized location happens to be in the area of the splice at the inside cut edge of the five wires where the 
bead bundle begins, the tensile strength of the wire carrying the full load of the inflating air is exceeded and it fails. At the instant 
when the first wire breaks, the load is immediately transferred to the next wire which breaks and in rapid succession all of the 
wires in the bead bundle rupture. But note that a bead will not break <i>unless the beginning of the bead wrap, splice, or area of 
overlap</i>, is trapped and is the last to seat. </p>
<p><strong>No Secret to the Tire Industry</strong> </p>
<p>The tragedy is that the tire industry has known this fact for years and, in fact, a Firestone engineer has acknowledged that when 
beads rupture in mounting &quot;the rupture frequently occurs at the ends of ribbon&quot; and bead breakage occurs when the area of the 
bead splice is the &quot;last to pass upon the rim.&quot; This same official admits that &quot;if the end of the ribbon on the radial inside of the 
grommet was not in the last portion of the bead to seat on the rim, no breakage occurred.&quot; </p>
<p>Since the ends of the ribbon cannot be determined after the bead grommet is built into the tire, whether or not the area of the 
splice is the last to seat on the rim is completely a matter of chance. </p>
<p>Another major tire manufacturer's chief of engineering, while declining to speculate why the beginning of the inside cut edge was 
the known place of failure, was forced to admit that the fact of breakage at this point is &quot;accepted by the tire industry and most of 
the tire engineers&quot; with whom he had been in contact. </p>
<p><strong>Common Defenses</strong> </p>
<p>Manufacturers have known for decades the reason why beads fracture and tires explode in the mounting process, but have been 
unwilling to reinvest in machinery that would produce explosion -proof bead. Bead failure arises as a direct result of the refusal to 
invest in new bead forming machinery and to put aside technology that is 50 years old. In short, the old way of making beads, on 
old equipment, gains the industry the most profits and there is a refusal to replace old equipment on an as needed basis with 
upgraded technology, since new fail-proof beads would constitute a severe indictment of the old design and an admission of 
industry misconduct. The industry finds it cheaper to allow predictable and preventable deaths and injuries to occur and pay for 
the damages in cases where their standard defenses do not succeed in defeating valid claims. </p>
<p>A main defense is over-inflation, notwithstanding the fact that it is impossible to explode a properly mounted tire with a fully 
seated bead tire by overfilling it with air. The primary reason is that air compression pressure at local service stations do not 
provide sufficient pressure to explode a tire. The tires on passenger vehicles and light trucks can easily be filled to 175 p.s.i. and 
they will not explode. The only way to explode a tire is to charge it to more than 250 pounds, at which time it will fracture into 
many pieces. This pressure level is not available at service stations, tire service islands, or in commercial tire shops. Suffice it to 
say that the only tires that explode while being mounted are those in which the area of the splice or overlap hangs up in the bead 
seating process and the bead fails at the inside cut edge of the bead grommet. </p>
<p>Blaming the victim for pinching the bead in the mounting process is common when there are external marks on the tire. As a 
practical matter, most tires can be easily button-holed onto the rim by hand and require few tools. Rarely does the bead break in 
any other location other than the inside cut edge of the grommet ribbon. When the bead fractures at the inside cut edge of the 
splice, any external marks on the tire itself have nothing to do with the failure. </p>
<p>In cases where the victim installs 16 in tire onto a 16.5 inch wheel the comparative negligence defense is bogus. Surprisingly, 
when 16 inch and 16.5 inch wheels are placed side by side, it is <i>extremely </i>difficult to tell the difference between the two since 
they are virtually identical in overall height. The deception is so dangerous and pregnant with major injuries and death that the 
16.5 inch wheel is banned in Europe. </p>
<p>Even more startling is the very well kept secret that a 16.5 inch wheel uses a <i>completely different</i> engineering system for 
securing the tire to the wheel. </p>
<p>The conventional drop center wheel [14 inch, 15 inch, 16 inch etc.] holds the tire in place on the rim by air pressing the <i>side</i> of 
the bead <i>against the inside portion of the rim flange</i>. </p>
<p>In comparison, the newer 16.5 inch wheel system, the tire is not held in place by the side of the bead against the flange. Rather, 
the wheel is designed very much like a jeweler's gauge for measuring the diameter of a ring and air pressure causes the bead to 
slide outboard, and upward along a ramp from the center of the wheel, until such time as the<i> bottom</i> of the tire bead is 
<i>restrained by the upward ramp of the wheel and the downward compression of bead grommet.</i> The rim flange plays 
virtually no roll in holding the tire onto the wheel. All the actual forces are at the base of the bead. </p>
<p><strong>Preventing Bead Failure</strong> </p>
<p>One solution to preventing bead failure at the inside cut edge was publicly proclaimed by another Firestone engineer in 1958 who 
proposed moving &quot;the beginning-end of the bead ribbon from the inside surface of the grommet&quot; by folding it around the bead 
and having it come to rest on the outer surface. He also suggested anchoring the inside cut edge by stapling or taping during 
fabrication, all of which &quot;does not require complicated machinery to mechanically build the grommet.&quot; </p>
<p>Unfortunately since 1958, no manufacturer has adopted this approach and the problem has continued. </p>
<p>One of the leading manufacturers of bead forming machines, National Standard Corporation of Niles, Michigan, directly 
addressed the problem with the introduction of in March, 1976. National Standard introduced a solid-state programmable 
single-wire bead machine capable of making 12&quot; through 24.5&quot; diameter beads. A single-wire bead, designed by computer 
program, can form, for example, a bead composing of 72 single wires that has the strength of a cable but <i>with only two cut 
ends</i> [as opposed to 10] which <i>can be placed on the final bead in a position where the inner edge of the bead grommet 
will not be harmed</i>. The advantages with this product is greater efficiency and strength. In addition, as National Standard 
employees have honestly admitted, </p>
<ul>
<li><i>the failure point of a conventional bead is almost always at the under lap or starting point of the ribbon. A single 
wire bead does not have this &quot;weak point&quot;</i>; it has one two wire ends, the leading end and trailing end. When subjected 
to burst tests, single wire beads failed at random circumferential points. [emphasis added] </li>
</ul>
<p>A second solution involves strengthening the bead wire. Bead wire is commonly .037 inches thick. Most bead wires could be 
easily replaced with .050 inch diameter wire. Since strength increases by the square of the diameter, this modest increase in 
diameter results in a wire that has 180% of the strength of the .037 inch wire. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>Bead fractures and tire explosions during the mounting process cause serious injuries and death. Identical breakage occurs in 
mounting standard tires and rims and in so called &quot;mis-match&quot; cases involving odd sized rims. The size of the bead bundle is 
academic. Bead fractures universally occur at the location of the inside cut edge, or starting edge of the ribbon forming the bead 
grommet which fortuitously catches during the normal seating process. The entire phenomenon depends upon the distortion of the 
bead bundle and the final loading of a single wire, which fails and causes a domino rupture of the balance of the wires in the bead 
grommet, resulting in an explosion. In every action for damages the industry continues to conceal its knowledge and always 
blames the innocent victim of a defect known to be inherent in the design and manufacture of a tire since the 1950s. While readily 
correctable, tire bead manufacturing techniques have not changed and manufacturers continue to make and sell defective beads. </p>

<h3>Deaths and Injuries to Children</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>

<hr>


<p>According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's latest estimates, from December 30, 1987 to the end of 1991, there 
were more than 1033 deaths and 224,500 injuries from all ATVs. Almost 40% of the victims have been, and will continue to be, 
children under 16. During this period approximately 415 children died and 90,000 were injured riding ATVs. The CPSC 
currently estimates that there will be 239 deaths and 48,100 injuries from ATVs in 1992 alone.</p>
<p>Although the number of deaths and injuries from three-wheel ATVs has decreased since 1988, this was expected to occur since 
ATV manufacturers had already begun shifting sales from the three-wheel to four-wheel models. By December, 1987 
manufacturers had already announced they were no longer producing three-wheel models.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the number of deaths from four-wheel ATVs has steadily increased since 1988. In fact, the CPSC estimates 
that the number of deaths from four-wheel ATVs will increase from 97 in 1986 to a projected 165 in 1992, a 70% increase. The 
number of injuries on four-wheel ATVs is also on the rise and the CPSC estimates that injuries will increase from 18,900 in 1986 
to a projected 28,600 in 1992.</p>
<h4>The Government's Response to the ATV Problem</h4>
<p>In 1984 the CPSC began investigating the hazards of ATVs and began rulemaking in 1985 to address the risk of ATV injuries. 
In December 1987, the Department of Justice filed an action in federal district court asking for a court-ordered remedy to 
protect consumers from ATV-related deaths and injuries on behalf of the CPSC. On the same day the CPSC filed a &quot;preliminary 
consent decree&quot; that it had negotiated with the ATV manufacturers.</p>
<p>Concerned that the preliminary decree would not adequately protect the public, especially children, the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group, Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen, and the American Academy of Pediatrics moved to intervene 
and requested a hearing on the adequacy of the decree before approving it in final form. Although Judge Gerhard Gesell denied 
intervenor status, he permitted the applicants to participate as amici, and to submit proposed amendments to the decree.</p>
<h4>The Consent Decree</h4>
<p>In April 1988, the Court finalized the Consent Decree and, instead of prohibiting the sale of ATVs for the use of children, 
required manufacturers to include certain age &quot;recommendations&quot; in their ATV advertising: ATVs with engine sizes greater than 
70 cc should be used only by children 12 and older, and ATVs with engine sizes greater than 90 cc should be used only those 
over 16.</p>
<p>The Consent Decree further requires ATVs to be labeled to warn purchasers that children under 16 should not ride adult-sized 
ATVs, and requires manufacturers to use their best efforts to ensure that dealers abide by these age recommendations and 
convey them to consumers, both orally and through the distribution of written materials. In addition, the decree required the ATV 
manufacturers to stop selling new three-wheel ATVs -- a practice the industry had already stopped before the CPSC complaint 
was filed -- to provide free driver training, and to launch a public awareness campaign to alert consumers to the hazards of 
ATVs.</p>
<p>In response to the concerns of the consumer groups and pediatricians, the Court asked the CPSC and ATV manufacturers to 
modify the Consent Decree to include provisions that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Require the CPSC to maintain in their Public Reading Room a complete library of materials relating to the Consent 
Decree; and,</li>
<li>Allow the CPSC to seek additional remedies if, after a two and a half year test period the decree had not been effective in 
significantly reducing the number of deaths and injuries from ATVs.</li>
</ol>
<h4>ATVs Kill and Harm Children</h4>
<p>Since the decree was approved, 95% of children 12-15 years old and 65% of children younger than 11 years old, who ride 
ATVs, continue to ride adult-sized ATVs. Ninety percent of the deaths and injures to children have occurred on adult-sized 
ATVs. Clearly, the Consent Decree's provisions which require manufacturers to warn prospective buyers that children under 16 
should not operate adult-sized ATVs have not been effective in protecting children.</p>
<p>ATV dealers continue to sell adult-sized ATVs for use by children. Nationwide surveys by the CPSC and PIRG have 
consistently found that ATV dealers are willing to sell adult-sized ATVs for children. For example, a 1989 U.S. PIRG survey 
found that 54% of the ATV dealers surveyed were willing to sell an ATV for use by a ten year old. </p>
<h4>CPSC Abandons ATV Safety Efforts</h4>
<p>Deaths and injuries on four-wheel ATVs are on the rise, and every year almost 100 children die and 20,000 are injured riding 
ATVs. The Consent Decree's age &quot;recommendations&quot; are clearly not effective in protecting children from this unnecessary risk. 
Nevertheless, on May 15, 1991, by a 2-1 vote, the CPSC decided to withdraw the rulemaking that had been pending since 
April 1985 and the agency terminated its efforts against the industry.</p>
<h4>Court Asked to Strengthen the Consent Decree</h4>
<p>One of the major goals of the Consent Decree was to protect children from the risk of death and injury, but the age 
&quot;recommendations&quot; included in the Consent Decree clearly have not worked. The same four organizations that submitted 
arguments to the court in 1988 in an effort to strengthen the Consent Decree have now asked Judge Gesell for additional 
protection. On September 17, 1991, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics filed a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of requesting the Court to enforce 
and modify the Consent Decree. The motion asked the Court to: 1) require the CPSC and ATV manufacturers to modify the 
Consent Decree to prohibit the sale of ATVs for the use of children, and 2) direct the CPSC to comply with its obligation to 
maintain a complete public library of materials relating to the Consent Decree. The groups argued that a prohibition on the sale of 
ATVs for use by children would send an unambiguous message to parents that the manufacturers are prohibited, by law, to sell 
an ATV for children. Thus, instead of &quot;warnings&quot; and age &quot;recommendations&quot;, both parents and their children would be told in 
strong, no uncertain terms, that the selling of ATVs for use by children is prohibited by the federal government. </p>
<h4>Consent Decree Found &quot;Not Nearly as Effective as Anticipated&quot;</h4>
<p>The Court responded with a memorandum and order on December 12, 1991, stating: </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;After examining the evidence, the Court is satisfied that the Final Consent Decree is not nearly as effective as anticipated. 
The decision of CPSC not to invoke its rulemaking authority to implement more stringent regulations represents an 
unwillingness or inability to recognize what appears to be an obvious need for exercise of its expertise.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Judge Gesell asked the groups for additional proposals for improving the decree, and allowed the groups, the CPSC, and that 
ATV distributors to submit additional evidence on the matter by April 15, 1992.</p>
<h4>Recall Demanded of ATVs Sold for Children </h4>
<p>In a submission filed January 15, 1992, the groups made several additional proposals to improve the effectiveness of the Consent 
Decree. For example, they asked the court to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Require the ATV industry to recall and provide a refund for any adult-sized ATV that was purchased for a child since 
December 30, 1987 -- the date the Consent Decree became effective; </li>
<li>Supplement the warnings required by the Consent Decree to ensure that children do not operate adult-sized ATVs; and, </li>
<li>Order the ATV industry to increase their efforts to ensure that their dealers do not sell adult-sized ATVs for use by 
children.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence in support of these proposals was submitted to the Court on April 15. Judge Gesell's decision is pending.</p>

<p><a name="intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> </p>
<p>When a consumer buys a fire insurance policy on their home they are betting in favor of a potential risk that most probably will 
not occur. To appreciate the rareness of a home fire consider all the times you have driven through your neighborhood or have 
flown into a major city. The number of house fires commonly encountered is rare. But if one does occur, it is a total financial 
catastrophe for most people. For that reason fire insurance policies are common. This is classic case of insurance at its best: 
everyone pays a small premium and in return receives the assurance they will not bear the full burden of a rare catastrophe. </p>
<p>In buying long-term health care, the consumer and the insurance company are engaging in a far different bet. The probability of 
the purchaser needing long-term health care at some time in the future is fifty percent. </p>
<p>Needing long-term health care is not rare. It is virtually guaranteed.</p>
<p>From an insurance standpoint the risk clearly becomes greater as the policyholder grows older and as expected, premiums 
can be expected to increase to cover this risk, otherwise there is no profit in being in this business.</p>
<p>When buying long-term care coverage, the consumer should anticipate that premiums will increase to levels that in all 
probability will severely strain a fixed-income budget, resulting in cancellation, just prior to the time when coverage is needed. 
All insurance companies know this because their records confirm an increasing level of cancellations as premiums increase 
with aging policies and aging policyholders. The customer does not. The end result is a system that is rich with the potential for 
fraud. Add to this situation the fact that sales agents are driven by high commissions and the potential for fraud can readily 
become a reality. </p>
<p>Just as in the case of health care coverage, once a consumer needs the benefits of a long-term care policy they are often 
physically, mentally and emotionally disabled and unable to assert their rights. This project was undertaken to alert, educate 
and warn consumers, and their families, now while they have the ability to make intelligent choices. Obviously this effort is not 
intended to be relied upon as legal advice and anyone who does so is making a dreadful mistake. The purpose of this 
compilation of information is to open the eyes of purchasers of long-term care insurance, describe some of the major 
problems consumers encounter and to warn of traps to be avoided. </p>
<p><i>The best possible advice</i> </p>
<p>Every insurance policy is a legal contract developed by teams of skilled lawyers working and modifying the document over a 
period of many years. Every time a new court decision alters existing law, trained contract specialists modify the contract in 
order to take advantage of new developments. </p>
<p>Understanding what a policy means and comparing the policies of different companies requires an understanding of the jargon 
of the insurance business and a familiarity with how terms of art have evolved and have been interpreted by courts. </p>
<p>If you have any doubts what the contract means and whether or not it will protect you after spending thousands in premiums 
and to avoid risking litigation in the future, it is far more sensible to pay for an informed opinion at the outset.</p>
<p>The key to having your expectations met when you submit a claim for benefits and to avoid being defrauded is to believe 
nothing you are told by a sales agent and to rely upon only what you read and understand in the policy. Ignore what you may 
read in promotional brochures. In 1994 a California appellate court declined to rule that a misleading advertising brochure was 
actionable and held that all that was needed to determine the relationship between the consumer and the insurance company 
was to read the policy. </p>
<p>If you do not understand the policy's terms, do not buy it until you fully understand what you are buying or else hire someone 
who can and will make sure you are making an informed decision. Some attorneys specialize in coverage questions. They 
know and understand insurance coverage issues. Ask potential lawyers if they have experience in insurance coverage 
questions and to detail that experience for you. Before you retain a lawyer, come to an understanding on the fees to be 
charged to interpret the policy. </p>
<p>If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer to interpret the contract you want to buy, you should ask yourself if you can afford to buy 
coverage and once you are in poor health and look forward to receiving policy benefits whether you then will be able to pay 
for a lawyer to enforce your rights under the contract if benefits are not forthcoming.</p>
<p>In the absence of an informed legal opinion, deal only with an established and respected insurance brokerage firm that has 
been in your community for years. An insurance broker is an independent agent for many companies and normally knows 
what the market is offering. Such a person can explain the advantages and disadvantages of various policies on the market.</p>
<p>Many insurance companies do not sell through brokers, but instead utilize exclusive agents. If you are considering a policy 
offered from such an agent, be sure to listen carefully and obtain opinions from independent brokers. Ask them to compare 
their best policy with the one you are considering, explain which is best and why. </p>
<p>When buying long-term care, make it a family decision. Bring together everyone who has an interest: your spouse, children, 
siblings, and closest personal friend. Their is a special value in collective decision-making that will help avoid some of the 
pitfalls that have been well documented. </p>
<p><i>Promises, easily made</i> </p>
<p>Nearly one out of every two persons age 65 and older will probably spend some time in a nursing home, which costs on 
average $30,000 annually across the United States and in major metropolitan areas the average escalates to $60,000 and as 
much as $100,000 per year. With an average nursing home stay of 19 months, seniors living in major metropolitan areas will 
spend $100,000 on long-term care in addition to medical bills and prescriptions.</p>
<p>Fearful of losing economic independence, older Americans are looking for security in long-term care insurance. Even though 
for seniors over 65 premiums can range from $2,000 to over $10,000 per year, long-term care insurance is &quot;the 
fastest-growing type of health insurance sold in recent years.&quot; Still, only five percent of those over 65 have purchased private 
long-term care insurance. Uninsured seniors constitute a lucrative market and as a result over 100 insurance companies now 
offer long-term care policies. </p>
<p>Long-term care policies pay the cost of the day-in, day-out care for a person with an acute or long-term illness or disability. 
Many seniors receive this care in nursing homes, but more effective and less expensive care at home and at adult day-care 
centers is growing in popularity, because it is less expensive and still provides the security of a longstanding home. </p>
<p>That is the theory, but in practice these policies are often riddled with loopholes that do not adequately protect a senior's life 
savings. Some policies have such strict disability criteria that many policyholders who need help do not qualify for benefits. 
Other policies narrowly define qualifications so that insurance company doctors, who are given bonuses for controlling costs, 
can overrule the medical orders of a policyholder's private doctor. Even when policyholders qualify for benefits, many will 
learn that their coverage has been out-paced by inflation. Yet only five of every one hundred 60-year-old consumers who 
take out long-term care insurance policies in 1995 will still have coverage in place at age 80 when they need it, because the 
high cost of premiums, which are likely to rise even higher, will force them to drop their coverage. Insurance companies 
carefully study buying and use patterns and know from experience that as the cost of policies increases the amount of policies 
in force declines at increasing rate, especially as consumers on fixed incomes find themselves facing increasingly tighter 
budgets as inflation continues. </p>
<p>Add to this cauldron of conflict the insurance company's sales commission structure. Insurance agents are loath to disclose 
policy pitfalls when it means risking the loss of a commission equal to life insurance commissions of 30% to 65% of the first 
year's premium, far more than the typical 10% commission many auto insurance agents earn. State regulatory agencies are 
insufficiently staffed to monitor sales presentations, except in undercover investigations such as the one conducted by the New 
York Superintendent of Consumer Affairs. In effect, no government agency holds insurance agents directly accountable for 
unacceptable sales practices. </p>
<p>In addition to the complicated terms in long-term care policies, the fear of actually needing long-term care can be even more 
difficult to face for seniors and their families. The expectation of needing long-term care strikes at the heart of personal 
concerns about losing one's health and economic independence. Seniors are particularly vulnerable to scare tactics and to 
stories of the infirm being thrown onto the street because they do not have long-term care coverage and lack the financial 
ability to provide for themselves. </p>
<p>Complicated policies loaded with fine print, sales agents driven by substantial commissions, and the vulnerabilities of seniors as 
consumers is fertile territory in which the strong can and will take advantage of those who cannot defend themselves.</p>
<p>Sales presentations are designed to overstate what policies will cover, explain eligibility criteria for benefits in terms that are 
not grounded in reality and manipulate statistics to make sales now. In addition, agents fail to explain significant aspects of 
policies and the high probability that premiums will increase. Scare tactics result in sales, so it is not uncommon for agents to 
report the cases of destitute seniors. Providing the new insured with a copy of the contract is also rare. </p>
<p>It is impossible for a consumer to make an informed purchase based on what is learned in a sales presentation. Even worse, 
insurance company promotional literature cannot be trusted to carefully explain the terms of the contract being sold. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>AMEX Assurance Company is a subsidiary of American Express Travel Related Services, is a name well known to 
consumers and enjoys the reputation of the American Express name. Nonetheless, a senior manager of the company relied 
upon blatant scare tactics in his sales presentation, pressing his customers to recall personal experiences with nursing home 
patients who were abused. Pushing to close the sale, he declared &quot;my grandfather would be turning in his grave now&quot; if we 
had passed up the chance to buy this protection. </p>
<p>A CNA agent falsely promised a level premium under the CNA. When pressed as to whether premiums can ever go up, the 
agent promised that a premium increase &quot;has never happened.&quot; Premium increases are common and to be expected. </p>
<p>Consumers should be equally leery of sales literature. An AMEX pamphlet tells buyers, &quot;Your nursing home stay is covered 
when your doctor certifies that it is appropriate.&quot; That is a lie. The policy clearly states that the company, not the 
policyholder's doctor, makes the final decision whether the policyholder qualifies for benefits. </p>
<p>Long-term care policies contain strict restrictions and limitations on benefits. Strict definitions control when and where patients 
can receive care. For example, it is not uncommon for policyholders to need &quot;continuous one-on-one assistance&quot; in 
performing daily activities in order to receive benefits. To qualify, one would have to be severely ill and be in need of 
admission to an intensive care unit to collect under the policy. </p>
<p>The solution to these abuses must come from government. Government has not acted because in large part insurance 
companies spend thousands of dollars in lobbying and consumers do not. In addition consumers lack the financial standing to 
prosecute cases and many times the actual damage is not suffered until the victim's health has so deteriorated that they are 
physically incapable of assisting their attorneys in fighting a major insurance company. In a perfect world government should 
mount undercover investigations of insurance agents who mislead consumers and make public examples of them by criminal 
prosecution. Insurance companies should be held strictly liable for the acts of their agents to make sure policies are not 
exaggerated and sales presentations are honest and straight forward. </p>
<p>Consumers should never believe they are smarter than the carrier's lawyers. Buying insurance is a legal gamble and consumers 
need to know the odds. Even with coverage, out-of-pocket costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars are not uncommon. 
Never buy a long-term care policy unless you fully understand it and have analyzed your complete financial needs. Always 
have a policy studied by a trained professional before spending. Make sure you know what you are buying. The General 
Accounting Office of the U.S. government is clear in its warning that consumers should never rely on the price of a policy &quot;as a 
good measure of value.&quot; The question of buying coverage is not what the price is today, but what will it cost in the future, what 
are the benefits and what do you need to do to qualify. </p>
<p><i>Defining long-term care</i> </p>
<p>As a result of disability or a prolonged illness, long-term care is the assistance provided when a person is unable to provide for 
himself or herself. It ranges from providing personal care at home, such as bathing and dressing, to skilled nursing services in a 
nursing home.</p>
<p>Long-term care is offered through home care agencies, senior centers, adult day care centers, traditional nursing homes, and 
retirement communities that provide on-going care.</p>
<p>In considering long-term care insurance policies various kinds of care are mentioned. Here are the most commonly used terms 
and their generally accepted meaning. Remember, the definitions given here can and often times are re-defined by carriers in 
their policy and given special meaning under a particular contract. It is important to read the fine print.</p>
<p>Skilled nursing care is needed for medical conditions that require care by specially trained nurses or therapists, who routinely 
are licensed by the state. This level of care is on the specific orders of a doctor who dictates the care to be provided and is 
usually required around the clock, 24 hours a day. It is the care given as part of a severe illness and can extend well after the 
severest level of an illness has passed. Skilled care can be provided in a person's home with help from practical, as opposed 
to registered, nurses.</p>
<p>Intermediate nursing care is associated with stable conditions that require daily supervision, but not around the clock care. It is 
less specialized than skilled nursing care, often involves more personal care and is supervised by registered nurses. 
Intermediate care is commonly needed for a matter of months and years.</p>
<p>Custodial care is intended to assist with daily living, which includes bathing, eating, dressing, and other routine activities. 
Special training or medical skills are not required. It is provided by unskilled nursing assistants in nursing homes, day care 
centers, and at home. It is often called personal care.</p>
<p>It is common for long-term care services to be provided in a person's home. It includes part-time skilled nursing care, 
practical nursing assistance, the services of a nurses aide, physical or occupational therapy, homemaker assistants, and chore 
workers, who provide assistance with daily living activities. The cost of long-term care Long-term care is expensive, 
depending on the severity of a disability, the degree of care needed and where it is to be provided. In 1991, the cost of a year 
in a nursing home averaged $30,000 across the United States. Skilled nursing care at home with two hour visits by a nurse 
three times a week over a year, would cost approximately $12,500. Personal care at home from a home health aide three 
times a week for two hours would cost approximately $8,400 a year. </p>
<p>In major cities, the cost can be expected to reach $60,000 a year and as much as $100,000. With an average nursing home 
stay of 19 months, seniors living in major metropolitan areas, can expect to pay $100,000 on long-term care in addition to 
medical bills and prescriptions. </p>
<p><a name="pays"><strong>Who pays for long-term care?</strong></a></p>
<p>The answer is simple: it comes from your cash and your assets, your family's assets and for those without assets it is paid by 
Medicaid programs administered by state government. More than half of nursing home bills are paid out-of-pocket by 
individuals and their families, and somewhat less than half are paid by state Medicaid programs. Insurance, and that includes 
Medicare, Medicare supplemental coverage and health insurance provided by employers, does not pay for most long-term 
care expenses. </p>
<p>Only in certain cases will Medicare cover the cost of some skilled nursing care in approved nursing homes or in your home, 
but there is no coverage for custodial or intermediate care or prolonged home health care.</p>
<p><i>Medicare does not offer long-term care as a benefit.</i></p>
<p>Medicare supplement policies are sold by private insurance companies and are offered to fill some of the gaps in Medicare 
coverage. Hospital deductibles and excess physicians' charges are routinely covered, but these policies do not cover 
long-term care expenses.</p>
<p>Standardized Medicare supplement policies, Plans D, G, I and J, do contain an at-home recovery benefit that may pay up to 
$1,600 per year but only for short-term, at-home assistance with activities of daily living, for an illness, injury or surgery during 
a limited recovery period.</p>
<p>Almost half of all nursing-home care billings are satisfied by Medicaid programs. This coverage is only for those who meet 
federal poverty guidelines for income and assets. For many people it means consuming assets to qualify for health care. 
Usually a personal residence is not counted when determining Medicaid eligibility, but other assets must be reduced to qualify. 
When it comes to long-term care it is common for the elderly to pay for care from their assets until they reach the poverty 
level and qualify for Medicaid to continue paying for nursing home expenses. As a result most people in nursing homes are so 
poor that financially they need to remain in the nursing home.</p>
<p>Qualifying for Medicaid differs from state to state as does the level of assets you are allowed to keep and remain eligible for 
Medicaid. While those requirements can and will be expected to change as the WW II Baby Boomer generation ages, it is 
strongly recommended that you ask your state Medicaid office, office on aging, state department of social services or local 
Social Security office to make sure you know the current eligibility rules before you begin looking at long-term care coverage. </p>
<p><a name="buy"><strong>Who should buy long-term care insurance?</strong></a></p>
<p>Long-term care insurance policy is not for everyone. For a limited population, long-term care policy makes sense as an 
affordable and worthwhile form of insurance. Buying long-term coverage should not cause financial hardship and force you to 
forego other financial needs. Whether long-term care insurance is appropriate requires a full financial analysis. For many 
people it is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Although the need for long-term care can arise gradually as a person ages and needs more and more assistance with activities 
of daily living, for most a stroke or a heart attack will be the precipitating need. Those with acute illnesses may need 
nursing-home care for a matter of months, while others may need care for years.</p>
<p>In any specific case it is difficult to predict who will need long-term care, but studies point out the likelihood of needing such 
care. In one study, it is anticipated that 43% of those who turned age 65 in 1990 will enter a nursing home at some time during 
their life. Of those who live to age 65, nearly 1 in 3 will spend three months or more in a nursing home and 1 in 4 will spend 
one year or more in a nursing home. Only 1 in 11 will spend five years or more in a nursing home.</p>
<p>Women outnumber men in nursing homes according to this specific study. Thirteen percent of the women as compared to 4% 
of the men, were projected to spend five or more years in a nursing home. And obviously the risk of needing nursing home 
care increases with age.</p>
<p>After assessing the odds that you will need long-term care, consumers must stringently analyze the reasons for a policy and the 
ability to pay for it for the balance of a person's life. It makes no sense to buy a policy unless it can be paid every year until 
death and far too many policies are cancelled by policyholders on fixed incomes as they grow older and their premiums 
increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Buying a policy is a function of your age, health status, overall retirement objectives, income and wealth. If the only source of 
income is a minimum Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), do not purchase a policy. If paying 
utilities, food or medicine stretches a budget, this person should not purchase a policy.</p>
<p>Long-term care policies are only for people with significant assets they want to preserve for family members, to assure 
independence and not burden families members with nursing home bills. Never buy a policy if paying the premiums will be a 
problem. If you have existing health problems that will result in the need for long-term care, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's 
disease, no company will sell you a policy because the probability of losses exceeds the probability the carrier will earn a 
profit on its contract with you. </p>
<p><a name="cover"><strong>What coverage is available?</strong></a></p>
<p>Standardized long-term care policies, such as can be found for Medicare supplement insurance, do not exist in the long-term 
care market. Comparing policies is extremely difficult because companies are selling policies with many different combinations 
of benefits and coverages. Most offer to pay a fixed dollar amount each day you receive care. Other companies offer to pay a 
percentage of the cost of services or a specified dollar amount to cover the actual charges for care. These policies are useless, 
unless they provide for benefits to increase as nursing home costs rise. Without inflation protection [described below] a 
consumer will be left with a benefit that is meaningless.</p>
<p>Long-term care benefits are offered as part of some individual life insurance policies Under this plan, a percentage of a 
policy's death benefit is paid when long-term care is needed and death benefit and cash values are reduced accordingly. These 
policies also commonly have strict rules for qualifying for coverage. </p>
<p><a name="offers"><strong>Who offers long-term care policies?</strong></a></p>
<p>Private insurance companies, both stock and mutual companies, sell long-term care policies through agents Some sell 
coverage through the mail and others through senior citizen organizations, fraternal societies, continuing care retirement 
communities and other groups. Employers are beginning to offer long-term care policies to their employees, their employees' 
parents, and their retirees. </p>
<p><a name="contract"><strong>What do contracts provide?</strong></a></p>
<p><i>What benefits are offered?</i></p>
<p>There are no &quot;standard&quot; benefits so it is difficult to compare policies offered by different companies. Some policies limit 
coverage for services provided in nursing homes and do not provide coverage for services delivered in your home, while 
others cover both nursing home and home care. Others companies pay for care only if it is provided by adult day care centers 
or other community facilities. Each policy defines what benefits it will pay, so it is imperative that you carefully read the fine 
print to understand what is offered.</p>
<p>In general, nursing home coverage usually pays for skilled, intermediate and custodial care. Some policies offer to pay for any 
care required, provided eligibility requirements are met.</p>
<p>Home care coverage is trickier. Some companies offer to pay for skilled nursing care in your residence but only if it is 
provided by certain providers: registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and licensed rehabilitation therapists. These policies 
usually do not provide home health aides. A home health aide has less education and training than registered or practical 
nurses and they are paid less than a licensed practical nurse. An aide assists with personal or custodial care. Only the 
exceptional policy will provide for homemaking services to cook in your home, run errands and perform work that otherwise 
could not be done. Because of the potential for being defrauded and the difficulty of monitoring benefits, rarely will an 
insurance company pay benefits to family members who perform home care services. Occasionally group policies sold to 
employers will provide some coverage allowing family members to provide care.</p>
<p>It's best to look for a policy that provides for a range of services, including home care services, since the nature and extent of 
the care to be required in the future is at best a guess.</p>
<p><i>Where are services provided?</i> </p>
<p>Insurance companies carefully limit and control where you can receive services to make sure they are paying benefits required 
under the policy and unless you are receiving services in an approved facility, companies will refuse to pay for your care. 
Many carriers will not cover custodial care unless it's provided in a skilled or intermediate nursing facility. Some will describe 
by name the types of facilities where you will not be covered. Most often these are homes for the aged and rest homes, even if 
they are in fact providing custodial care. There are so many different restrictions written by insurance companies that it is 
impossible to list them all here. Common descriptions include the type of nursing supervision, the size of the facility, type of 
care provided, and level of licensing. Check these rules very carefully and search for companies that offer a range of facilities. 
Remember, the insurance carrier wants you in the least expensive facility that will not provide any level of care above the 
minimum care it is obligated to provide.</p>
<p>Policy restrictions will often be in conflict with state licensing requirements and will not authorize payment for custodial care 
coverage in a particular facility even though it is licensed to provide custodial care. Another pitfall is that facilities certified by 
Medicare to provide skilled nursing care may be excluded as skilled nursing care providers .</p>
<p><i>Common exclusions</i></p>
<p>Do not expect any carrier to pay benefits for: </p>
<ul>
<li>mental disease and nervous disorders, other than Alzheimer's; </li>
<li>addictions to drugs and alcohol; </li>
<li>injuries and illnesses caused by war; </li>
<li>treatment paid by the government; or </li>
<li>injuries that are self-inflicted, such as in suicide attempts. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some companies cover Alzheimer's disease. As always, read the fine print.</p>
<p><i>Limits on benefits</i></p>
<p>Benefits are usually described in terms of the amount the carrier will pay per day for care in a nursing home and vary from $75 
up to $250 a day. Gain familiarity with the general charges for nursing homes in your area before you buy a policy. Keep in 
mind that prices will increase by the time you will need care, so all you are obtaining is a reference level to familiarize yourself 
with the market. Once you know prices in your area you can calculate the range of future charges by following the Rule of 72. 
This simple formula allows you to determine the length of time it will take for a price to double at a given rate of interest. 
Assuming a nursing home near you charges $100 per day and that nursing home charges will increase at an annual rate of 6% 
per year. How long will it take the price to reach the $200 level? The answer is calculated by dividing the number 72 by the 
interest rate. Seventy-two divided by six gives a quotient of 12. Assuming a six percent rate of inflation, the $100 a day 
charge will double in 12 years. So if you are 60 years of age and purchasing a policy with the expectation that you may need 
nursing home care in your early seventies, you should be looking for a policy that will be paying benefits of at least $200 per 
day twelve years from now.</p>
<p>Home care is growing in popularity with patients and carriers so read policies carefully for limits. Many policies usually agree 
to pay for home care at a rate that is one-half of the nursing-home rate. Other policies limit the benefits for home care to a 
specified daily sum or limit the number of hours at a specific rate per hour.</p>
<p>All policies allow you to specify how long you desire benefits to last. Benefit periods range from one year to life. Remember 
that most nursing home stays are three months or less and many people have illnesses that last for years. Obviously policies 
with long benefit periods cost more. How do you decide? If you own your home or have a minimum mortgage and will be 
depending upon Social Security and a company pension for retirement income, you will want to protect your equity in your 
home in order to preserve a place for your spouse to live. Assume that you will need up to 19 months in a nursing facility at 
current rates and compute that cost. Compare that to your available assets and you can begin making some intelligent choices.</p>
<p>Carefully consider any limits on benefits if you have a repeat stay in a nursing home. Some policies require that you must be 
discharged from a nursing home for a stated time period before you can be re-admitted. Others calculate the second 
admission as part of the first if you return within 30, 90 or 180 days. Does the policy require an elimination period to run again 
for a second stay? Repeat nursing home admissions are not the rule, so this is a minor consideration when comparing policies.</p>
<p>Under home care provisions, the benefit period is usually more limited than for nursing home stays and benefit periods of one 
to two years are available.</p>
<p><i>Calculating when benefits will start</i></p>
<p>Most policies do not pay benefits until after a waiting period, commonly called an elimination or a deductible period. That 
means benefits begin 20, 30, 60, 90 or 100 days after you are admitted to a nursing home. Some policies have no elimination 
period and they naturally cost more. During any waiting or elimination period, you are responsible for paying for your care, but 
there are significant trade-offs. Having a reasonable waiting period during which you are personally responsible for your care 
means the insurance company can expect to pay out fewer benefits and accordingly underwriters can establish lower prices 
for these contracts. </p>
<p><i>Inflation protection</i></p>
<p>Only a fool would buy a policy to provide long-term care that does not provide for inflation protection. Most people are fools 
and end up with policies that provide benefits which are meaningless and in the process have squandered years of premiums 
that have done nothing but enhanced insurance company profits. However, unless your policy provides a way for your daily 
benefit to increase, you will learn a very serious and sad lesson about the increasing costs of nursing home services. Assume 
nursing home costs today of $100 a day and 8% inflation, what will the cost per day be in 18 to 20 years? Apply the Rule of 
72, the cost will double every 9 years and in 18 years a charge of $100 per day will be $400 [double in nine and then 
re-double in an additional nine years]. If you bought a policy that did not provide for an annual inflator your insurance carrier 
would only pay a fraction of your expenses. Inflation protection is critically valuable and important.</p>
<p>Insurance companies provide inflation protection through two vehicles. Some offer customers the right to buy additional 
coverage in the future at the future price the company will be charging. The catch here is that the new premium will be based 
on your current age, which means it will be more expensive because it is more probable that you will need nursing care, but 
many companies will sell you the coverage without proof of insurability. If you have a policy with this protection and if you are 
suffering from a progressive condition you would be smart to exercise your option to buy more coverage. The major disability 
for the consumer is that the price of buying added coverage goes up rapidly, and many customers decline the additional 
protection because they cannot afford it. Furthermore, some companies require that you buy the additional coverage when it's 
offered or you lose the right to buy more in the future.</p>
<p>The second approach to inflation protection is to provide for automatic benefit increases. But even here while the daily benefit 
increases by a fixed percentage, carriers usually cap coverage at the end of 10 or 20 years. Some companies may offer 
unlimited increases and others end benefits when a customer reaches age 80 or 85. The next trick employed by the carriers is 
the method used to calculate the percentage increase. Some use a &quot;simple interest&quot; approach and add to the daily benefit each 
year by a stated percentage of the original coverage. In a 5% simple inflator policy the coverage on a $100 daily benefit 
would increase by five dollars every year. At the end of fourteen years the daily benefit would be $170 dollars, but if the 
company used the &quot;compound interest&quot; method, at the end of 14 years the daily benefit would be close to $200 [72 divided 
by 5]. Always buy a policy with automatic increases that are calculated using the compounded method.</p>
<p><i>Waiver of premium</i></p>
<p>A provision waiving premium payments is common in health insurance policies. It discontinues your legal obligation to pay 
premiums if you are receiving benefits. Some companies stop billing you as they make the first benefit payment. Others wait 
60 to 90 days. Often premiums are not waived while you are in a hospital or if you are receiving care at home. </p>
<p><i>Nonforfeiture benefits</i> </p>
<p>Nonforfeiture benefits in policies provide that at least some benefits will be paid even if the buyer fails to keep up premium 
payments and the policy is cancelled for non-payment. The benefits provided are usually minimal.</p>
<p><i>Death benefits</i></p>
<p>Death benefits are an agreement to refund to your estate any premiums you paid minus benefits paid to you. </p>
<p><a name="determine"><strong>Who determines if you are entitled to benefits?</strong></a></p>
<p>All policies have &quot;gatekeepers&quot; who have the power to decide if you are eligible for benefits. Every policy contains terms 
usually referred to as &quot;eligibility for benefits,&quot; &quot;qualifying for benefits,&quot; or &quot;benefit conditions.&quot; Gatekeepers are a critical feature 
of every long-term care policy and one you should carefully study before you buy because there is a big difference between 
companies when it comes to who decides if the company will pay out money. For some companies this issue is so important 
that the policies provides for more than one gatekeeper. </p>
<p>Under the best policies, you can qualify for benefits if your doctor orders specific care. Other policies will require that care be 
&quot;medically necessary for sickness and injury.&quot; You already know who will make that determination. If you are in need of 
nursing-home services, but are not sick or injured, you would not qualify. The insurance company would determine whether 
you were sick or injured. A third type of rule limiting your right to benefits requires that you be unable to perform a certain 
number of &quot;activities of daily living,&quot; commonly referred to as ADLs. These normally include bathing, dressing, walking, 
moving from bed to chair, toilet, maintaining continence, and eating.</p>
<p>Some policies evaluate mental functions to determine the qualifications for benefits. This gatekeeper standard is important in 
cases of Alzheimer's disease. Even though insurance regulators require policies to cover Alzheimer's disease, a policyholder 
who has the disease can be denied benefits if he or she is physically able to perform the activities of daily living specified in the 
policy, unless there is a mental functioning criteria. If the policy uses an ADL gatekeeper, an insured with Alzheimer's disease 
may not qualify even though they are at risk for forgetting to take medications and may forget to come home after they walk to 
the corner store for a loaf of bread. With a mental functioning standard, a policyholder with the disease is more likely to 
receive benefits.</p>
<p>ADL criteria are not the same from one company to another. Most insurers define what is meant by an inability to perform a 
particular activity such as failure to feed or bathe oneself. A definition that requires someone to physically assist in performing 
the activity is more restrictive than one that calls for someone to supervise the activity. It is the difference between being able 
to climb into a bath by yourself, needing someone to lend a hand or needing someone to actually make the transfer for you. 
The more specifically a company describes its requirements, the opportunities for disagreements and disputes will be lessened. </p>
<p>A few policies require customers to have a prior hospital admission of at least three days before qualifying to receive benefits. 
This requirement severely limits a disabled person's ability to receive benefits. Medicare uses this requirement to determine 
eligibility for skilled nursing benefits.</p>
<p>As explained in great detail below, gatekeepers are used to keep consumers from reaping benefits and are a major source of 
cost control for carriers. </p>
<p><i>Eligibility to buy coverage</i> </p>
<p>Insurance companies do not sell policies without first determining what the probability will be that they will have to make good 
on the bet. This is called &quot;underwriting&quot; and it means the company evaluates your health before it will sell you a policy. Some 
companies follow &quot;short-form&quot; underwriting. On the application for coverage, you will be asked to answer a few questions 
about your health. Have you been in a hospital during the last 12 months or are you confined to a wheelchair? If you answer 
&quot;no&quot; to all of the questions, the company believes you are a good bet to be a customer who will pay money in and not force 
them to pay out. The insurance sales person is authorized to issue coverage as soon as you write a check.</p>
<p>Other companies are more selective. They will examine your current medical records and ask for a statement about your 
health from your doctor. Having conditions that are likely to require long-term care makes you a bad bet and will disqualify 
you with these companies.</p>
<p>Always answer all health questions truthfully. If the salesperson completes the form as you are asked questions, change any 
entries that are not 100% correct before you sign the application. The reason is simple. Once you make a claim you become 
just another statistic and the company will not pay you a penny if it later can claim that you lied about your health. If there is 
anything the carrier can do to avoid paying it will and the carrier will lament that it relied on the misstatement to grant 
coverage. Even though you &quot;won&quot; the bet and are entitled to benefits, the carrier will rescind your policy and return the money 
you wagered. These companies do not investigate your medical record until you file a claim, and then they investigate it with 
extremely fine attention to every conceivable reason why they should deny benefits based on inconsistencies. This practice is 
called &quot;post-claims underwriting.&quot; It is illegal in many states. Companies that do their underwriting studies at the outset and 
thoroughly check on your health before issuing a policy are not as likely to engage in post-claims underwriting.</p>
<p>Never guess when filling out an application. Do not answer a question unless you understand it. If you do not know that 
&quot;pulmonary&quot; refers to lungs, then you should not respond to any inquiries concerning &quot;pulmonary&quot; conditions, complaints or 
symptoms. Just because you believe you know what a word means, does not mean you understand it. This is not a matter of 
pride. If you do not know what a word means, ask.</p>
<p>Trying to remember every condition you ever had and when you had it is not easy. It is far better to state that you believe you 
have had that condition but do not recall when or the details. Add an asterisk [*] to every section of the application where you 
are not sure and at the place for explanations add an asterisk and the words &quot;please see the records of Dr. Smith&quot; or whoever 
can provide the necessary information. If you follow this advice, the company can never deny you benefits after the fact 
because you were honest in disclosing what you remembered and offered the carrier access to a specific doctor's records 
where the information could be found. If a carrier tries to deny coverage for a customer with this information in their 
application, the insurance company's lawyers will be facing a lawsuit not only for the damage caused by the company, but in 
addition punitive damages.</p>
<p>Many companies will issue a policy if a customer has relatively minor health problems, but will not cover those particular 
conditions for a period of time, usually six months or longer. A pre-existing condition is one for which you sought medical 
advice or treatment or had symptoms within a certain period before applying for the policy. Companies also vary in the length 
of time they will look back at your health status, and you will want to consider these variations as well. If the company 
discovers you have not disclosed a pre-existing condition on your application, it may refuse to pay for treatment related to that 
condition and perhaps terminate your coverage. </p>
<p><i>The company's right to rescind</i></p>
<p>An insurer can rescind a policy and refuse to honor a claim where the policyholder has not provided full and complete 
information in the application.</p>
<p>Where the language of the application is clear and capable of only one interpretation, where there have been no modifications 
in the application made by the sales agent, the purchaser had knowledge of the information requested, the policyholder 
concealed requested information or misrepresented his/her history and the misrepresentation was material or critical, then the 
insurer can rescind the policy.</p>
<p>The burden of proving misrepresentation falls on the insurance company. In many cases the carrier must prove its case by 
clear and convincing evidence, which is a more stringent burden than the usual standard which requires proof by a 
preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many companies accept policyholders only to provide the most rigorous scrutiny when a claim is presented, 
which is natural and to be expected. Insurance companies and their employees have the highest duty not to pay a false, 
fraudulent or illegal claim. It is the nature of the beast. If a policyholder has failed to disclose his/her full medical history, the 
company would be a fool not to take advantage of such a failure to avoid paying a claim.</p>
<p>The best insurance against have a policy rescinded for failure to make a timely and full disclosure is to make a full and 
complete disclosure, not matter what the sales agents says. On this issue the agent should be thought of as the enemy. The 
agent's interest is in making the sale and earning the commission. It matters not that 10 years later coverage will be denied. 
What matters to the agent is getting paid this month for the policies submitted and accepted by the company.</p>
<p>Defend yourself by making a full disclosure no matter what the agent says. If the policy is not issued to you now, at least you 
can apply to other companies. This is a far better result than having the carrier issue the policy to you and then rescind once 
you have need for benefits and are not in a position to apply to anyone because of the condition of your health. </p>
<p>Check the application carefully. If any condition has not been fairly reported, added it to the form.</p>
<p>Tender your complete medical records with your doctors by name and address in answer to any question where you do not 
know the answer. Never answer &quot;no&quot; when you do not recall. &quot;I don't know&quot; is a common idiom in American speech. Literally 
it means absence of knowledge, but as a practical matter most folks use it when they do not recall. In a court of law there is a 
huge gulf of difference between the two. So, be smart and be safe, always answer &quot;I do not recall&quot; when an answer does not 
immediately come to mind, instead of answering &quot;I do not know.&quot; It may save you from losing coverage when you need it 
most. </p>
<p><i>Limitations on renewing</i></p>
<p>Today almost all policies are guaranteed renewable. Even if your health worsens after you buy the policy, it cannot be 
cancelled. But keep in mind that companies can raise premiums on guaranteed renewable policies. Renewability does not 
mean you will be guaranteed a good price. It only means you will be again offered the bet, although the amount you will have 
to put up may increase substantially. It is this aspect of long-term care that is the most troublesome. The older you get the 
greater is the probability that you will be injured or take ill. As a result carriers facing an older customer will routinely increase 
the amount of the bet to cover their losses, knowing full well that for a customer on a fixed budget the probability the insured 
will not renew increases as the amount of the premium increases. The carriers also know with a high degree of probability 
when the cost of a future year will be declined, at what age most customers give up their coverage and what price increase will 
cause the most cancellations for those in the highest risk groups. This is the real world and there are no free lunches, but this 
reality is still troublesome. </p>
<p><a name="cost"><strong>Cost of a policy</strong></a></p>
<p>A long-term care policy can be expensive. Before signing a contract analyze whether you can readily pay the premiums for 
long-term care, Medicare and Medicare supplement coverage. The annual premium for long-term care policies with good 
inflation protection is in the neighborhood of $2,000 for 65 year-olds. Premium are lower for those who are a better bet the 
carrier will not have to pay benefits, primarily those who are younger. Policies cost more for those who are older. At age 75, 
the premium will be two and a half times greater than if the policy had been purchased at age 65 and six times higher than if 
you bought it at age 55. It's common for a husband and wife age 65 to spend approximately $7,500 a year for health 
insurance coverage. A policy with a large daily benefit that lasts for several years, is more expensive. Inflation protection can 
add 25 to 40 percent to the benefits and nonforfeiture rights can add 10 to 100 percent to the bill.</p>
<p>When buying a long-term care policy you must consider whether you can afford to pay the premium now, and more 
importantly whether you will be able to continue to pay the premiums in the future. Policies that are &quot;guaranteed renewable&quot; 
only mean that the company guarantees that it will offer you the opportunity to renew the policy and continue the coverage; it 
does not mean that you are guaranteed renewal at the same premium. Premiums can and will rise over time as companies 
begin to experience greater payouts in nursing home claims. However, once you buy a policy the premiums won't rise just 
because you get older, although add-on coverage will increase in cost. </p>
<p>Perform a personal financial audit and decide how much income you have available to spend on a long-term care policy now. 
Project your future income, your living expenses, and how much you can pay. If you don't expect your income to increase, it 
would not be prudent to buy a policy now with a premium that is at the upper limit of what you think you can afford. </p>

<p><i>Loopholes and Fine Print Written by Insurance Company Experts</i></p>
<p>Now that the fundamentals of long-term care insurance are understood, it is time to look more closely at how long-term care 
insurance companies operate.</p>
<p>The most important concept to understand is that long-term care insurance policies will not protect a person's savings. </p>
<p>Despite the claims of sales personnel, most policies are so flawed that if agents were honest about the policies' limitations, 
many customers would probably not purchase them at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to properly cover anticipated future costs and reasonably hedge their bets against rising premiums, consumers 
would have to choose such high benefit amounts that most would decide that the policies would be unaffordable.</p>
<p>Consumers who are wealthy enough to afford adequate coverage most probably have the assets to cover the costs of 
long-term care without the high cost of long-term care insurance. The most common and most serious pitfalls of buying 
long-term care are detailed below. </p>
<p><i>Inflation Protection</i></p>
<p>Long-term care policies for seniors living in major metropolitan areas with high labor costs can expect to pay $167 per day 
for nursing home care. This translates into $61,000 per year. If a consumer purchases a policy that pays a fixed $100 per day, 
with an inflation rate of six percent per year, $100 per day will pay less than one-third of the daily cost in 12 years, and 14% 
of the cost in 24 years. The math is easy. At six percent inflation the cost of nursing care will double every 12 years and the 
daily charge will become $354. In twenty-four years the same nursing charge will have grown to $708 daily. So a consumer 
who purchases today at age 56 a long-term care with a fixed benefit of $100 per day who requires nursing-home care at age 
80 will have to pay more than 85% of the costs out of his or her own pocket.</p>
<p>The answer is to purchase compounded inflation protection that increases the benefit the policy will pay each year. Since 
health-care costs predictably will continue to inflate, the U.S. House Select Committee on Aging concluded that &quot;without 
inflation protection..long-term care insurance policies are not a wise purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>Carriers offer purchasers the option to buy inflation protection under four different options, none of which will fully protect 
buyers against increasing nursing home costs.</p>
<p>Simple inflation protection. This option increases the daily benefit annually by a given percent of the original base benefit. In 
other words, a $100-per day nursing home benefit which covers 60% of today's costs would increase $5 each year, making 
the daily benefit $150 after ten years and doubling the benefit after 20 years to $200. But if inflation in the long-term care 
market continues at 6%, the average daily cost of a nursing home is projected to $296 in ten years and $530 in twenty years. 
As a result, rather than maintaining a benefit at 60% of cost, simple inflation protection allows this coverage to erode to only 
37% of cost in 20 years.</p>
<p>Five percent compounded inflation protection. Rather than increasing the daily benefit by five percent of the original benefit, 
this option increases the benefit by five percent compounded, meaning that each successive year's benefits are increased by 
five percent over the previous year. So while the example above pays simple inflation protection and only covers 37% of 
expected future costs after 20 years, the compounded option at 5% compounded per year will pay approximately $265 per 
day, after twenty years. This approach is the best option available, but given the historical, as well as anticipated, six percent 
inflation rate for long-term care costs, this plan does not keep pace with inflation.</p>
<p>Indexed inflation option. This option gives the buyer the right to increase the amount their policy will pay once every three 
years. The amount of the increase is indexed and tied to the Consumer Price Index reported by the U.S. government. This 
option is based on the real rate of inflation. This is not much help for the consumer if the inflation rate for long-term care 
services continues to be higher than that for goods and services. Additionally as the benefit increases so does the premium. As 
the policy and the owner age the premium increases significantly and for purchasers on fixed incomes it is probable the policy 
will be discontinued because it is too expensive at a time when coverage is most needed.</p>
<p>Option to purchase additional coverage. This option offers little benefit to the consumer because it only allows the 
policyholder to purchase additional benefits at then-current rates. Sales agents tout this coverage as a worthwhile option 
because it offers a policyholder the right to purchase additional coverage without having to prove medical eligibility. Consumer 
Reports rated this the worst possible option. It is equivalent to no inflation protection.</p>
<p>Because these options increase the cost of a policy nearly 50%, sales agents interested in earning a commission do not urge 
inflation protection to sales prospects. As a result inflation benefits are not often sold and the Health Insurance Association of 
America (HIAA) reports that of the major carriers offering inflation protection across the United States only one-quarter of 
the policies sold include inflation provisions</p>
<p><i>Nonforfeiture Benefits</i></p>
<p>A nonforfeiture benefit is essentially a useless option added to a contract to give a sales person something to crow about. The 
promise is that the carrier will return to the policyholders some of their &quot;investment&quot; in the policy if they discontinue coverage. 
Without a nonforfeiture benefit term, these companies claim that it would be unfair if you drop the policy say 10 or 20 years 
later and never used it. These companies usually offer a nonforfeiture benefit in the form of a reduced paid up policy in which 
lesser benefits are provided after you drop the coverage. Other carriers may offer a &quot;return of premium&quot; in which they return a 
portion of the premiums after a certain number of years if the policy is cancelled. A nonforfeiture benefit is a cost item carefully 
calculated by the carrier's actuary. It has a cost that is added to the underlying policy.</p>
<p>Assuming a policy is purchased at age 60 and remains in effect until age 80, the age by which 50% of all seniors will need a 
nursing home, the average policyholder will have paid in the neighborhood of $60,000, about the cost of a year of nursing 
home care. Most seniors have difficulty maintaining their policies until they reach age 80, when they most probably will need 
them. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners reports that 16% of all nursing home insurance buyers drop their 
coverage each year because they can no longer afford it. Insurance companies know that of those who buy coverage at age 
sixty, 95% will have cancelled the coverage by age 80. The U.S. General Accounting Office confirmed those figures. Of 
insurance company files that were investigated and excluding those who had died, 60% or more of the original policyholders 
allowed their policies to lapse within 10 years and one insurance company reported a lapse rate approaching 90%.</p>
<p>Nonforfeiture benefits provide consumers who most probably will not be able to maintain their premium payments at least 
something for their premium dollars. Without nonforfeiture benefits, once a consumer stops paying all rights under the policy 
end. The most popular nonforfeiture benefits are:</p>
<p><i>Reduced paid-up benefit.</i></p>
<p>This benefit pays the policy benefits at a reduced rate, depending upon how much money was paid into the insurance 
company. For example, if an individual paid premiums for 10 years, he might receive one-third of the benefit of a $100 a daily 
policy or $34 per day. The amount of reduced benefits is specified in the original contract. The reduced paid-up benefit 
amount will not increase for inflation and all policy restrictions apply.</p>
<p><i>Extended term benefit.</i></p>
<p>Under this concept the customer receives the originally specified daily benefit, but only for a reduced period depending upon 
how much money was paid to the carrier over the life of the policy. For example, after 10 years, 25% of the premium paid is 
credited to a &quot;benefit account&quot; and, if the policyholder qualifies, the company will pay benefits until the money in the account 
runs out. So after paying nearly $30,000 over 10 years the customer would be entitled to $7,500 in long-term care benefits - 
little more than the cost of one month in a nursing home today in a metropolitan area The insurance company would only pay 
benefits from this account until the account was depleted.</p>
<p>At best, nonforfeiture benefits are similar to a consolation prize paid by the carrier to customers who have guaranteed a profit 
to the company by never making a claim, paying premiums and then cancelling the policy prior to qualifying for benefits.</p>
<p><i>Gatekeepers</i></p>
<p>&quot;Gatekeepers&quot; are what consumers typically refer to as the &quot;fine print&quot; when they are denied benefits they believe they are 
entitled to receive. To the insurance company expert these terms are the key aspects of the policy because they limit the rights 
of consumers to collect benefits, they specifically define what coverage is provided, and where it can be received. Gatekeeper 
rules are the reasons why claims are denied, and they can render policies virtually worthless. Important gatekeeper limitations 
are often contained in the &quot;definitions&quot; section of the policies which many consumers do not carefully read.</p>
<p>The most important gatekeepers a well informed consumer needs to understand and recognize are : </p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring prior hospitalization in order to qualify for nursing home and/or home care stays. According to a 
Congressional study, &quot;57% of all those who enter a nursing home were not hospitalized before their admittance.&quot; 
Insurance companies know this fact and those that include such a limitation in their policy know that 57% of all buyers 
are being defrauded because the policy is worthless. This is a classic example of a rip-off that is designed and intended 
to defraud an innocent and unsophisticated purchaser of a policy. </li>
<li>Requiring an acute condition before services would be covered. &quot;Acute&quot; is often defined as &quot;medically necessary,&quot; and 
refers to a specific illness with severe onset over a defined period of time, usually brief. A heart attack is an acute 
condition that requires immediate medical attention. But keep in mind that 47% of all nursing home residents have 
chronic illnesses. Chronic illnesses are those that are ongoing, long lasting and not likely to subside, including 
Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, immune system dysfunctions, and a host of slowly progressive illnesses that simply 
do not get better. As the patient ages these diseases take their toll. If a policy requires a hospital admission for an acute 
condition as a pre-condition for nursing care services and long-term care, do not buy this policy. As long as you are 
going to be giving away your money, give it to someone you love or someone that needs it more than an insurance 
company. The probability of seeing any benefits with both restrictions in place is highly doubtful. </li>
<li>Limiting services to those provided by registered nurses or licensed practical nurses. There are many custodial and 
home care needs that do not have to be performed by licensed nurses, these include cooking, cleaning, and general 
supervision at home or in a nursing home. </li>
<li>Requiring providers to be certified by Medicare. Hundreds of nursing home and home care providers are not 
Medicare-certified. Nonetheless they are capable of providing necessary services. By limiting coverage to 
Medicare-certified agencies carriers restrict the freedom to choose appropriate care providers. </li>
<li>Covering only &quot;skilled&quot; care. &quot;Skilled&quot; care is insurance language meaning services provided by a doctor or a nurse. 
Most &quot;skilled&quot; care is already covered by Medicare and most Medicare supplemental insurance, making policies 
covering only &quot;skilled&quot; coverage absolutely and totally worthless. Nearly 50% of people receiving nursing home 
services do not require skilled care. </li>
<li>The inability to perform three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The commonly recognized ADLs are: bathing, 
dressing, toileting, transferring (getting in and out of a chair or bed), continence (voluntary bowel and bladder 
functions). Approximately 2.9 million U.S. citizens need assistance with only one or two ADLs. A policy that requires 
assistance with three or more ADLs is designed and intended to rarely offer benefits to the policyholder. </li>
<li>Vaguely defining the inability to perform an Activity of Daily Living. What constitutes &quot;needing assistance&quot; with 
performing an ADL can be made a subjective standard by the insurance company, when it should be subject to 
objective verification. Many carriers define the inability to perform an activity as needing &quot;continual one-on-one 
assistance.&quot; This is tantamount to denying coverage since it is an impossible restriction. A person would have to be 
unable to do an activity such as getting up from a chair without always having the direct physical assistance of another 
person. So if a consumer often could not get out of a chair, but at times could get up with the help of a cane, then that 
person would not qualify as needing &quot;continual one-on-one assistance,&quot; and would not qualify for benefits. This type of 
gatekeeper is in reality a stone wall since a person would have to be so severely ill as to require an intensive care unit or 
be at death's door in order to meet the requirement. Under such conditions a hospital and not a nursing home would be 
needed. It would be virtually impossible under such a policy to qualify for benefits covering home care assistance for a 
portion of a day. </li>
<li>Having the right to have insurance company controlled doctors determine the health needs of the policyholders. Patients 
have close relationships with their doctors and expect to be covered for services their doctors prescribe. All companies 
reserve the right to demand that policyholders be examined by company's physician or &quot;benefit advisors&quot; who can 
overrule a consumer's own doctor. This restriction places the decision for health care in the hands of insurance 
companies motivated by cutting costs and maximizing profits. </li>
<li>&quot;Service based&quot; not &quot;disability based&quot; coverage. According to Consumer Reports &quot;the most liberal coverage would be 
provided by policies that allowed policyholders to obtain services wherever they wish when disabled.&quot; This is known as 
disability-based coverage. No long-term care policies have been discovered that meet this standard for nursing-home 
care. Instead, current policies are &quot;service-based,&quot; so that regardless of the type or level of disability, policyholders are 
limited to receiving particularly defined services at specific facilities. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Elimination Periods</i></p>
<p>Most long-term care insurance policies require policyholders to pay for their own care for a specified number of days before 
they are entitled to receive benefits. The days paid for directly by the policyholder are commonly referred to as an &quot;elimination 
period,&quot; which is very much like a deductible in accident insurance. In the long-term care policy the deductible is set forth in 
days rather than dollars, most probably to keep consumers from focusing on the fact that nursing care is always increasing in 
cost and defining the deductible in this manner is a direct benefit to the carrier. Some companies offer products without an 
elimination period, but most require as few as 30 days to as long as one year.</p>
<p>How the elimination period is calculated differs from company to company. Some carriers count the days cumulatively, where 
for example a patient moves in and out of a nursing home. Other companies demand that the waiting period be counted 
consecutively, namely, they do not allow any interruption in the days of nursing home care in order to qualify. Some require 
only one elimination period for the life of the policy and others begin counting every time a policyholder applies for benefits. 
Elimination period rules can require consumers to physically pay costs out of their own pockets, not just incur liability for 
services. Most policies even require the consumer to continue paying premiums while also paying health care costs during the 
elimination period. </p>
<p>Elimination periods are designed to contain costs and because carriers are interested in lowering the cost of total benefits to be 
paid, many push insureds into less expensive home care. As an incentive to encourage home care, waiting periods often are 
shorter than for nursing home benefits, but once the choice is made for home care obtaining more comprehensive care will be 
a problem.</p>
<p>In selecting a waiting period, you'll have to weigh the trade-off between paying more for coverage that begins when you enter 
a nursing home or paying out of your own pocket for the first days you spend there. Generally speaking you are better off 
choosing the highest deductible period that you can afford because the probability of an additional day in a nursing home 
decreases with each day of an illness. Another way to view this choice is to consider the length of a nursing home stay in terms 
of gambling odds. The odds are high that after spending the first night in a nursing home you will need to be there for at least a 
month. After ninety days in a nursing home the odds of your needing to stay there an additional day are much lower. That is 
exactly how an insurance company actuary views this situation. If a nursing home in your area costs $100 a day, a policy with 
a 30-day elimination period will require you to pay $3,000 or in other words your insurance company does not have to pay 
$3,000. Consider what you can afford today for a thirty day nursing home stay. If you have the discipline to put that much 
money into a long-term government treasury bill you will be guaranteed that money will be there when you need it. Only then 
you should buy a policy with a thirty day wait.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, there are significant savings the longer the waiting period you can accept. Look closely at this aspect of 
purchasing long-term care coverage.</p>
<p><i>Death Benefits</i></p>
<p>In a policy offering a death benefit the company agrees to refund to your estate a stated level of the premiums you paid minus 
the benefits paid to you. To qualify for a death benefit with most companies you must have paid premiums for a certain 
number of years. Others limit the payback if the policyholder dies before a certain age, usually 65 or 70. Death benefits are a 
cost to the carrier, increase the premiums to be paid by an insured and offer little value.</p>
<p>The main value of a death benefit is to provide the insurance company sales agent with an opportunity to present the carrier in 
a false, beneficent light, in the event premiums are paid for years and the policyholder promptly dies without ever qualifying or 
needing care. Should this case arise &quot;we obviously have no need to be unjustly enriched and for that reason pay the death 
benefit provided in the policy,&quot; is what you can expect to hear from the sales agent.</p>
<p>Remember, there is no such thing as a free lunches. Every aspect of an insurance contract has a specified cost. The idea is for 
money to come into the company and not to go out unless it is absolutely mandatory under the specific terms of the policy. 
Life insurance policies, while still having their own peculiar defenses, do not provide as many opportunities for denying 
coverage. The insured is either dead or alive in most cases. Long-term care because of the seemingly endless possibility for 
different facts to occur has that many more potential opportunities for carriers to hide behind policy provisions and to avoid 
paying benefits unless they are squarely mandated by the policy. </p>
<p><a name="senior"><strong>Seniors: targets for scams</strong></a></p>
<p>Seniors abhor losing physical independence and becoming financially dependent. They buy long-term care insurance coverage 
to avoid becoming dependent on family or friends. The fear of nursing homes makes them especially vulnerable to high 
pressure sales tactics that focus upon the risk of losing assets and with reassuring promises of protection.</p>
<p>Loneliness clearly magnifies seniors' concerns and their vulnerabilities as consumers. One-third of those who are older than 65 
live alone, and the ratio of women to men is two to one. Looking at those who own their own homes and who are often 
targeted to buy long-term care insurance, more than half live alone. When people are isolated their beliefs are readily 
influenced by those who fill the loneliness of their lives. This is a human factor well understood by long-term care insurance 
sales agents, who focus on these seniors as the most likely source of sales.</p>
<p>Lonely seniors have difficulty resisting sales pressure, especially those who live alone who do not have anyone looking out for 
their interest and no one with whom to discuss the decision to buy long-term care. The opportunity for fraud to occur in this 
setting is unchecked. The most common tactic is known as &quot;turning, turn to earn, or churning,&quot; in which sales agents return 
once a year to pitch a &quot;new and improved&quot; insurance policy. By convincing a buyer to cancel a good policy a sales agent 
subjects a customer to higher premiums and new waiting periods for the sake of earning a new commission. State insurance 
departments commonly report receiving complaints of this type of misconduct. </p>
<p><i>Sell, sell, sell</i></p>
<p>Long-term care insurance, like life insurance, routinely pays a high percentage of the first year's premium to the sales agent. In 
the long-term care field the sales commissions are usually 50 to 66% of the first year's insurance premium. The average 
long-term care insurance commission is 48.5%, which is enormous. When policies are renewed, a long-term care agent earns 
an average commission of 13% of the premium. By way of comparison, more readily sold auto insurance policies pay ten 
percent commissions on new policies and 5% on renewals, which in some cases only continue for a specified period. Because 
of the need to &quot;sell&quot; long-term care and the time necessary to secure a purchaser, companies offering a long-term policy with 
$200-per-day benefits for three years and with compound-inflation protection will pay commissions in the range of $2,000 for 
the first year of the policy, and $500 for every year the policy is renewed. If a consumer purchases such a policy at age 65 
and pays premiums for 20 years, the sales agent will earn $12,000 over the life of the policy. By focusing sales efforts on 
selected adult communities, such as synagogues, churches, senior centers, senior recreation programs, and senior 
neighborhoods, an aggressive agent with a thousand policyholders can generate a substantial cash flow with minimum 
overhead.</p>
<p>Because they are dealing with a gullible market of unprotected consumers, insurance agents are rarely reported to state 
insurance investigators and few are charged with misrepresenting benefits or rights under the policies they sell. In virtually all 
states the Insurance Commissioner or the State Department of Insurance does not have financial resources to conduct 
undercover investigations and that is the only way the unscrupulous are caught. The little undercover enforcement is targeted at 
thieves engaged in criminal activity, rather than misleading sales presentations, which is believed to be less serious, although the 
damage can be as equally devastating to the victim. </p>
<p><i>An undercover Investigation in New York</i></p>
<p>Salesmen promoting long-term care routinely urge the elderly to buy protection to preserve their life savings, as was shown by 
an undercover investigation spearheaded by the New York Superintendent of Consumer Affairs. A sales brochure claimed 
that the company's &quot;Individual Long-Term Care insurance plan will allow you to protect your assets and insure your 
independence should you require long-term care services.&quot; Unfortunately for the average American, with or without a 
long-term care policy, life savings are still at risk. Most policies, in all probability, will not cover the total cost of extended 
medical care 10 to 15 years after the policy is purchased. The policyholder will always be out of pocket for some portion of 
care, especially if the policy provides a limit, or cap, on the available benefit unless it provides for inflation protection. </p>
<p>To understand why this is the case apply the Rule of 72 to calculate how often the charge for nursing care today will double. 
Assuming a 6% rate of inflation in the medical sector, a nursing facility charging $150 a day will be charging $300 a day in 12 
years. Unless a long-term care policy has equivalent inflation protection, it will never keep pace. The policyholder will always 
have to pay for some care from accumulated savings or home equity.</p>
<p>A long-term care insurance policy purchased in 1995 that would actually cover the anticipated cost of an average nursing 
home in 2010 would have to pay $200 daily benefit inflated by five percent on a compound basis or a $235 daily benefit using 
a five percent simple inflation factor. And even at these high levels, seniors would still exhaust personal assets for each year of 
care after 2010, or even sooner assuming nursing costs home inflate at a greater than expected rate.</p>
<p>Although a policy with high benefit amounts could be expected to cost $3,000 annually, many agents sell policies providing 
much lower benefit levels costing $2,000 per year. These sales personnel routinely claim that such a policy will cover all 
long-term care expenses, which is not true.</p>
<p>In the New York special investigation, an agent selling a plan that provided $200 a day with a simple five percent inflation 
protection said, &quot;...this is the one most people go for because it pays all the costs that are involved. It pays up to $200 a day 
for your care in nursing home, $6,000 per month for the nursing home benefit, which is about what nursing homes are in this 
area...these benefits are going to increase every year for 20 years at the rate of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Sounds good, but if benefits increase at only a five-percent simple-inflation rate, less than the predicted six-percent rate of 
nursing home inflation, this proposal cannot &quot;pay all the costs that are involved.&quot; If the consumer should need benefits at age 
80 the policy is $16,000 short and every year thereafter the amount increases. At age 85 this customer would be out of 
pocket approximately $50,000 for every year of needed care.</p>
<p>A CNA agent reported: &quot;I think that if you have the five-percent simple interest, you'll be pretty much keeping up with it fairly 
well. You might have a little bit that's not covered, but you can buy $220 a day.&quot; In this case, at age 80 the shortfall would be 
$16,000 per year. If the consumer bought the $220-a-day benefit, the shortage would be $3,000, but then the difference in 
premiums paid in the interim would be substantial.</p>
<p>An IDS agent claimed that for a $2,400 annual premium, &quot;the best kind of protection&quot; could be bought, i.e. a $150 daily 
benefit. Obviously, this is totally insufficient to cover actual costs. </p>
<p><i>Protected from higher premiums </i></p>
<p>Customers are often told by agents that their policies could not be canceled and that premium costs would remain level, a 
promise that everyone would like to believe, but it is not that simple.</p>
<p>Insurance companies cannot unilaterally raise premiums on any one individual policy, but they can petition state insurance 
commissioners or departments of insurance for legal authority to raise premiums for all policy holders in a given pool of 
insured and then raise rates for everyone in that class.</p>
<p>Despite the promises by agents that premiums are fixed and will not increase, premiums have increased and are expected to 
increase in the future. Experts in industry, government, and consumer advocacy organizations expect it to continue. No one 
has yet found a company that decreased rates in the long term care field.</p>
<p>According to an officer with Standard Life and Accident, &quot;The next five years will produce rate increases as the rule rather 
than the exception for most companies currently marketing long-term care insurance.&quot; The U.S. Government Accounting 
Office also found that, &quot;because the long-term care insurance market is still developing, the extent to which policy prices will 
increase remains uncertain.&quot; Consumers Reports [July, 1991] describes the precarious future of long-term care premiums as 
follows: Companies can justify lower premiums by underestimating the dollar value of claims they will eventually have to pay 
or by overestimating the number of policyholders who will drop their coverage before they ever file a claim. Some insurers are 
doing both. Either way, if more claims materialize than the company has counted on, it will have to raise policyholders' 
premiums or risk going out of business.</p>
<p>Such predictions are a realistic appraisal of what can be expected. For example when Standard Life and Accident took over 
United Equitable's policies, the company raised premiums between 103% and 213%. The expected result would be that many 
would cancel their coverage. A U.S. Congressional study reports that 66 companies requested rate increases nationally in 
1990, and 60 were approved. The increases averaged 31.7%.</p>
<p><i>All care is not covered</i></p>
<p>Next to no one understands what long-term care involves at the time when they purchase a policy. Restrictions are not truly 
understood until care is needed. Agents readily gloss over restrictions on their policies and misstate what is actually provided. </p>
<p>A New York Life agent described respite care as informal care, even that provided by &quot;a friend.&quot; Actually, the policy defines 
it as &quot;care provided by or through a Home Care Agency, including companion care or live-in care, to temporarily relieve other 
care providers in the Home Convalescent Unit.&quot; This does not cover services provided by members of the policyholder's 
immediate family or friends.</p>
<p>When asked if consumers could spend their insurance benefits however they wanted, a CNA agent agreed. Read the fine 
print. The policy specifically lists what is covered by nursing homes as well as home-health-care services. The carrier is not 
going to turn over a check to the insured under this policy.</p>
<p><i>Qualifying will not be easy</i></p>
<p>In the New York investigation salesmen told customers that policyholders simply had to get a note from their doctor to qualify 
for benefits. That is far from the truth. Under all policies there are critical &quot;triggers&quot; for receiving benefits, such as not being 
able to perform activities of daily living or sustaining a mental disability. Even worse, some argue that the customer's personal 
doctor's order could not be overruled by the carrier's physician. This occurred even though nearly all policies can demand a 
medical examination of the claimant in order to determine eligibility for benefits.</p>
<p>An AMEX manager told undercover agents that &quot;your nursing home stay is covered when your doctor, not our doctor, not 
somebody else's physician, gives approval. This is what distinguished us from other companies, and this is why we have the 
American Health Care endorsement.&quot; Read the policy: &quot;we reserve the right, as part of the review, to do a face-to-face 
assessment or to require you to take a physical examination paid for by us. Similar reviews may be required, at reasonable 
intervals, to determine your eligibility for continued benefits. We may use an outside service to assist in evaluating your 
condition; but any decision will be made by us based on consistently applied, reasonable standards.&quot; </p>
<p>According to a New York Life agent promised if &quot;you're sick, they'll pay.&quot; Under the actual policy an insured could be sick 
and still not meet the restrictive &quot;continual one-one-one assistance&quot; standard in the policy.</p>
<p>Many times the trigger requirements are grossly misstated. In one case a Travelers agent said that not being able to take 
medications was a trigger. However, taking medications is not one of the &quot;activities of daily living&quot; described in the Travelers 
policy and a policyholder would not qualify to receive benefits if he or she could not take their own medications.</p>
<p>In another case when asked what activities-of-daily-living criteria were the triggers for benefits under an IDS policy, that agent 
said &quot;basic taking care of the house.&quot; However, the policy language is clear and unambiguous. The definition of daily living is: 
bathing, dressing, toileting, continence, transferring and feeding.</p>
<p><i>Filing a claim will be a challenge</i> </p>
<p>Most consumers know nothing about the important requirements for filing claims until policy benefits are needed. It is a tragic 
pitfall for the unwary. Nearly all long-term care policies in New York, for example, require that the insured give written notice 
to the company within 30 days of disability. Most policies require verification of disability not just once but every 30 to 90 
days. Giving timely notice and continuing to verify disability can be a daunting task for a long-term care claimant often suffering 
from a serious disability. Insurance companies can and will deny benefits if the insured does not comply with guidelines for 
filing claims or cannot meet exactly the criteria to qualify for benefits. If a claim is denied consumers have little recourse other 
than contacting their State Department of Insurance, or filing suit. Few contracts provide for appeal rights and force a 
policyholder to proceed with filing a suit to obtain benefits. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the New York investigation found agents promising that filing a claim was &quot;a very easy, uncomplicated 
process. You make a phone call to an 800 number, notifying the company that this individual is going to go on claim and that 
there's going to be a claim form that the doctor, your doctor, is going to complete and send up to us.&quot; A reading of that 
company's policy requires the insured submit a &quot;written notice of claim&quot; within 60 days after a covered loss and a &quot;proof of 
loss,&quot; including copies of medical records and/or telephone consultations with a primary physician and with providers of health 
care services.</p>
<p>An UNUM agent said, &quot;When you receive the policy, there's a form inside. But actually you would call me. That's why I'm 
here, to call me.&quot; The written policy though requires that the insured must give the company &quot;written notice of claim within 30 
days of the Loss of Functional Capacity or Cognitive Impairment&quot; and that the company &quot;will send you our initial claim forms 
when we receive your written notice of claim.&quot; The customer must also provide an initial proof of claim no later than 90 days 
after the date of loss, and must give proof of continued loss at intervals requested by the company. Finally, the contract notes 
that the company may require &quot;an independent medical examination&quot; and that it reserves &quot;the right to select the physician to 
perform the independent medical examination.&quot; Independent medical examination in this case is all to often an insurance 
company medical examination by a physician specially selected to be disposed towards the carrier. </p>
<p><a name="dirty"><strong>Dirty tactics</strong></a></p>
<p><i>Fear of Financial Disaster</i></p>
<p>Agents skillfully utilize carefully contrived scripts to stampede customers to buy now by using the fear of financial ruin, 
becoming dependent on family or going on &quot;welfare&quot; because of catastrophic medical bills. Sometimes more subtle tactics are 
used, but real scare tactics are effectively used because they motivate many seniors to buy coverage in the first place and sales 
agents readily manipulate this common concern.</p>
<p><i>Uninsurable tomorrow</i></p>
<p>Closing the sale is often accomplished by telling the customer that he/she risks being uninsurable in the future, but if the 
consumer hands &quot;over a check today,&quot; he or she would be covered even if an illness or disability struck tomorrow. Not so 
easy. Agents do not explain that a customer could still be turned down for the policy and he or she would not receive any 
benefits, regardless of whether the prospective insured paid the whole premium immediately.</p>
<p>Another technique is to threaten the risk of increasing premiums in the future so that consumers will &quot;buy now.&quot; But buying 
long-term care insurance at a younger age can be a mistake. Many policies limit increases for inflation after 20 years or at the 
point where the original benefit doubles, so a consumer buying early in life could be left with inadequate benefits when needed. </p>
<p><i>Small print and big disappointments</i></p>
<p>In 1990 the U.S. House Select Committee on Aging reported that it had received a wide range of complaints, which included 
delays in receiving premium refunds, twisting and churning, duplicate sales, overselling, clean sheeting, and agent 
misrepresentations. The Committee also heard numerous complaints from consumers who have been damaged by 
anti-consumer provisions in policies that benefited the carriers. The number and severity of those complaints are a direct 
warning to the elderly to protect themselves from similar abuses.</p>
<p>One customer wanted to purchase nursing home coverage for an 83-year-old aunt with arthritis and suspected Alzheimer's 
disease. An insurance agent sold the customer a policy with an annual premium of $1,735 promising that Alzheimer's was a 
covered disability. However, the company later denied a claim on the grounds that the application had not noted Alzheimer's. 
The aunt is now on Medicaid. Out-of-pocket cost for the first two months of care totaled $7,000. The only avenue for relief 
was to retain a lawyer.</p>
<p>A widow from Oregon died penniless in a nursing home, even though she had two policies and had paid thousand of dollars in 
premiums for nearly 10 years. The carrier denied nursing-home care because the care needed did not meet the definition of 
&quot;skilled&quot; care described in the policies. The sales agent had promised the policy would provide financial security. It did not.</p>
<p>An Illinois man purchased a nursing-home policy in 1981 for $1,000 a year. By 1985 his annual premiums had increased to 
more than $5,000. In 1987, he cancelled his coverage because his insurance company raised his annual premium to $8,000 a 
year. A few years later, he needed care, and paid the entire cost himself because he no longer was covered and did not have 
nonforfeiture of benefit protection.</p>
<p>In Missouri, a physician prescribes nursing home care for a man who was unable to care for himself and selected an 
intermediate-care facility. The director of the facility agreed the placement was correct. Nonetheless the carrier denied the 
claim on the ground there was &quot;no indication they any medical regimen was being pursued which would require the continued 
residency on a clinical basis.&quot; The carrier vetoes the personal physician and the nursing home director.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware. </p>
<p><a name="switch"><strong>Switching plans or upgrading coverage</strong></a></p>
<p>Before you buy a new policy, make sure it is better than the one you already have. Even if your agent has switched companies 
and wants you to switch too, carefully consider any changes. If you do decide to switch, make sure your new application is 
accepted before you cancel the old policy. If you cancel a policy in the middle of its term, most companies will not return any 
premiums you had paid. If you switch policies, pre-existing conditions clauses may have to run again, and you may not have 
coverage for certain conditions for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>It may be appropriate to switch, however, if you have an old policy with requirements for a prior hospital stay or for prior 
levels of care, and you are in good health and can qualify for another policy. If you have a good policy you bought when you 
were younger, you might ask if the insurance carrier can enhance the policy, for example, by adding inflation protection. It 
might be cheaper to keep the policy you have and improve it rather than buy a new one. </p>
<p><a name="consider"><strong>Considerations when buying a policy</strong></a></p>
<p>Here are some points to keep in mind as you shop.</p>
<p><i>Always check with several companies and agents</i></p>
<p>Is it wise to contact several companies (and agents) before you buy. Be sure to compare benefits, the types of facilities you 
have to be in to receive coverage, the limitations of coverage, the exclusions, and, or course, the premiums. (Policies that 
provide identical coverage and benefits may not necessarily cost the same.)</p>
<p><i>Take your time and compare outlines of coverage</i></p>
<p>Never let anyone pressure or scare you into making a quick decision. Don't buy a policy the first time an agent comes calling. 
Ask the agent to give you an outline of coverage. The outline of coverage summarizes the policy's benefits and highlights 
important features. Compare outlines of coverage for several policies.</p>
<p><i>Understand the policies</i></p>
<p>Make sure you know what the policy covers and what it does not. If you have any questions, ask the agent or call the 
insurance company's home office before you buy.</p>
<p>If the agent gives you answers that are vague or differ from information in the company literature, or if you have doubts about 
the policy, tell the agent you will get back to him or her later and don't hesitate to call or write to the company and ask your 
questions. Beware of an agent who claims the policy can be offered only once.</p>
<p>Some companies may sell their policies through the mail, bypassing agents entirely If you decide to buy a policy through the 
mail, contact the company if you don't understand how the policy works. </p>
<p><i>Don't be misled by advertising</i></p>
<p>Don't be misled by the endorsements of celebrities. Most of these people are professional actors who are paid to advertise. 
They are not insurance experts. </p>
<p>Neither Medicare nor any other federal agency endorses or sells long-term care policies. Be skeptical of any advertising that 
suggests the federal government is involved with this type of insurance.</p>
<p>Be wary of cards received in the mail that look as if they were sent by the federal government. They may actually have been 
sent by insurance companies or agents trying to find potential buyers. Be skeptical if you are asked questions over the phone 
about Medicare or your insurance. Any information you give may be sold to insurance agents who will call you or come to 
your home.</p>
<p><i>Don't buy multiple policies</i></p>
<p>It is not necessary to purchase several policies to get enough coverage. One good policy is enough.</p>
<p><i>Your medical history is extremely important</i></p>
<p>Accurately disclosing your medical history is extremely important. Make sure you fill out the application completely and 
accurately. If an agent fills out the application for you, don't sign it unless you have read it and made sure that all of the medical 
information is correct. If information about the state of your health is misstated, incomplete, or wrong, the company will refuse 
to pay your claims and cancel your policy. For that reason you should always fully and completely explain the full extent of 
your medical condition. If you are unsure about any particular item be sure to state &quot;do not recall.&quot; And as a catchall to protect 
yourself, always refer the carrier to your doctors' records of the care provided to you and list the names and address of your 
doctors.</p>
<p><i>Never pay the agent in cash</i></p>
<p><i>Write a check and make it payable to the insurance company</i>.</p>
<p><i>Get the name, address, and telephone number of the agent and of the company</i></p>
<p><i>If you don't receive your policy within 60 days, contact the company or agent</i></p>
<p><i>Read the policy again and make sure it provides the coverage you want </i></p>
<p><i>Reread the application you signed</i></p>
<p>It becomes part of the policy. If it's not filled out correctly, notify the insurance company immediately. Keep the policy in a 
convenient place where you or anyone else readily can find it, and tell a trusted friend or relative where it is.</p>
<p><i>Pay premiums automatically</i></p>
<p>It may be a good idea to have premiums automatically deducted from your bank account and paid electronically by your 
bank. Should an illness delay or prevent paying your statements on time, your coverage will not lapse. </p>
<p><i>Buy only from a financially stabile company</i></p>
<p>Several private companies or rating agencies conduct financial analyses of insurance companies and grade them. These ratings 
carry no guarantee of accuracy but can provide you with information on how some analysts view the health of particular 
insurance companies. Different agencies use different rating scales, so be sure to find out how the agency labels its highest 
rating as well as the ratings for the companies you are considering. Ratings from some agencies are available at most public 
libraries, or you can call the agencies directly at the numbers listed below. (Note that there will be an extra charge on your 
telephone bill for calls to a &quot;900&quot; number.)</p>

<p>Weiss Research, Inc. (800) 289-9222</p>
<p>The United States General Accounting Office in September, 1994 issued a special report to the Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Consumer Protection and Competitiveness of the U.S.House of Representatives committee on Energy and Commerce, 
entitled Insurance Ratings: Comparison of Private Agency Ratings for Life/Health Insurers [GAO/GGD-94-2094BR]. The 
report is worthwhile ordering at a cost of $2 by writing U.S. General Accounting Office, P. O. Box 6015, Gaithersburg, MD 
20884-6015. </p>
<p>In brief, the General Accounting Office concluded that the insurer ratings issued by Weiss, Best, Standard and Poor's, 
Moody's and Duff &amp; Phelps could not be easily compared because the companies did not use the same approach and 
methods to rate insurers. But, &quot;Weiss placed far less reliance than the other agencies on analysts' judgment.&quot; In addition, 
Weiss was the only agency to rate more than half of all insurers. Both Weiss and Moody's were less likely than others to 
assign insurers their top ratings.</p>
<p>On average Weiss' ratings reflected financial vulnerability much sooner than other companies. In comparing the two leaders in 
life and health carrier evaluations, the federal government study found that out of 26 cases of financially vulnerable insurance 
firms, in which both Weiss and Best issued &quot;vulnerable&quot; ratings, Weiss was the first to warn in 19 cases. In addition Weiss 
reported on 4 additional companies that Best did not report as financially vulnerable. Weiss also acted earlier than Best. On 
average Weiss acted 8 months before Best did.</p>
<p>In addition, Weiss has a record of reporting adverse ratings well before public regulatory commissions and state departments 
of insurance. Weiss identified Executive Life of California 379 days before the first public regulatory action. Executive Life of 
New York in 372 days, Fidelity Bankers in 308 days, First Capital in 617 days, Monarch in 162 days and Mutual Benefit in 
40 days. Best on the other hand reported on Executive Life of California only 6 days before regulators took action and in the 
case of the other reported failures only issued a report several days after public action had been taken.</p>
<p>Assuming that the past is prologue for the future, Weiss is the odds on choice for a rating agency, followed by Best. Weiss 
also provides a very valuable &quot;watch dog&quot; warning service to consumers interested in a specific company at a cost of $76 
dollars a year or consumers may choose to call for a verbal rating at a charge of $15, a brief written report for $25 or a 
personal safety report for $45. When you are planning on spending thousands of dollars on long-term care premiums, a 
detailed personal safety report and a &quot;watch dog&quot; reports make good sense. Reviewing a policy during the free-look period</p>
<p>If you decide you do not want the policy after you purchase it, you can cancel the policy and get your money back if you 
notify the company within a certain number of days after the policy is delivered. This is called the &quot;free-look&quot; period. Check 
with your state insurance department to find out how long the free-look period is in your state. If you want to cancel do the 
following: </p>
<ul>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li>Keep the envelope the policy was mailed in, or insist your agent give you a signed delivery receipt when he or she 
hands you the policy. </li>
<li>If you decide to return the policy, send it to the insurance company along with a brief letter asking for a refund. </li>
<li>Send both the policy and letter by certified mail and obtain a mailing receipt. </li>
<li>Keep a copy of all correspondence. </li>
<li>The refund process usually takes 4 to 6 weeks. </li>
<li>If you have questions about the agent, the insurance company, or the policies, you can contact the state insurance 
department. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="policy"><strong>Policies from your employer</strong></a></p>
<p>Your employer may offer long-term care insurance as an employment benefit. The coverage provided by these 
employer-group policies is similar to what you could buy from an agent. Companies providing long-term care insurance 
usually give their employees a choice of benefit periods, maximum payments, and elimination periods. Group policies may 
offer nonforfeiture benefits and inflation protection and allow employees to keep their coverage after they leave their 
employer. They do this by offering continuation of coverage or conversion options.</p>
<p>Many employers also allow employees to buy coverage for their parents, which could be an advantage. Typically, employees' 
parents must pass the company's medical screening to qualify for coverage; employees usually do not have to pass any 
medical requirements. If your child's company offers such coverage, be sure to consider it carefully. It may offer advantages 
you won't find if you try to buy a policy on your own. </p>
<p><a name="final"><strong>Final word</strong></a> </p>
<p>Look for policies that provide compounded inflation protection at a realistic percentage.</p>
<p>Avoid policies that use &quot;continual one-on-one assistance&quot; as the trigger to qualify for benefits. Few people needing long-term 
care meet this highly pro-insurance company requirement.</p>
<p>Only buy policies that clearly define and illustrate all criteria for qualifying for benefits, including the criteria that determine a 
policyholder's &quot;inability to perform&quot; the activities of daily living.</p>
<p>When a policy requires that services must be provided by a licensed agency or provider, the policy should state exactly what 
license is required so consumers can verify for themselves that they are being treated by an approved provider. </p>
<p>Policies should explain in detail the claim-filing process and the policyholder's rights to appeal the company's benefit decisions.</p>
<p>Ignore any promises made in promotional literature. If it is not in the contract, it does not exist. If you cannot read and 
understand the contract do not buy it, unless you have the advice of a trusted and established broker or have had the policy 
reviewed and explained to you by an attorney who has experience in insurance contract interpretation. </p>
<p>Before buying a policy calculate your income, your assets and your budget. How much of your income can you afford to pay 
for insurance premiums? Long-term care does not cover doctor bills and prescription drug costs. Elimination periods, 
waiver-of-premium clauses, benefit amounts, and inflation factors all affect the price of a policy. For the purpose of these 
calculations, consumers can assume that the average nursing home charges today are approximately $60,000 per year. To be 
prudent expect increases at a rate of six percent annually. Home care nationally averages $50 per visit for a health aid and 
$100 per visit for a trained nurse; this cost will also increase with inflation.</p>
<p>Premiums are likely to increase in the future. Know how much you are able to spend, and consider hedging your bet by 
purchasing nonforfeiture benefits in case you are forced to let your policy lapse.</p>
<p>Never be rushed into signing on the spot. Be sure to read and understand a policy's fine print before you give an agent your 
check. Do not accept assurances that you will be able to get a full refund if you decide not to buy the policy even after it is 
approved. The chances of being approved should not be hurt by simply taking a few days to look over the contract. Never do 
business with an agent who will not provide you with a copy of the contract you are considering.</p>
<p>Know the available options. Most policies give consumers choices in the following areas: benefit amounts, duration of benefits, 
elimination period, inflation protection, and nonforfeiture benefits.</p>
<p>Know how to qualify for benefits. Keep an eye out for highly restrictive criteria, such as &quot;continual one-on-one assistance&quot; and 
performance criteria for cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Know the restrictions on benefits. Under the criteria for qualifying for benefits, will you be able to receive benefits for 
home-care services? Are there facilities in your area which meet the policy requirements for nursing-home benefits?</p>
<p>Know how to file a claim and how to appeal an adverse decision. You can file a lawsuit against your insurance company, but 
most companies specify a short time period in which you are allowed to file a legal action, so waste no time in finding a 
competent lawyer with experience in suing insurance companies for breach of contract and for breach of the covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing.</p>
<p>Try to make sure the insurance company you choose is highly rated. Many premium increases are the result of one insurance 
company assuming the obligations of another company that has gone out of business. Be extremely cautious and only do 
business with companies that have &quot;A+&quot; or &quot;A&quot; financial ratings. High ratings are not a guarantee of a company's future 
stability.</p>
<p>Do not buy a policy primarily because it has the lowest price. Policy benefits and qualification requirements vary greatly 
among policies and no one can compare policies based solely on cost.</p>
<p>Once you have purchased a policy, do not readily trade it for what is promised to be a better contract. Trading up is often 
expensive and subjects you to new preexisting-conditions waiting periods and potentially new elimination periods. You will 
forfeit all of the money you have already paid in premiums. If you want additional coverage, it is usually better to add-on to 
what you already have. </p>
<p><a name="sue"><strong>When all else fails: suing for breach of contract</strong></a></p>
<p>First and foremost, what follows is not legal advice. That can only come from a qualified attorney who is familiar with all the 
facts and circumstances of a particular, specific case.</p>
<p>The following is a brief explication of the general law in the United States. By definition this explanation is flawed. There is no 
such thing as the general law of the United States, especially when you have a particular legal questions involving a specific 
case, because the law of each state, while following general common rules, is different.</p>
<p>In virtually all states the laws applying to the interpretation of the enforcement of insurance contracts are generally the same, 
but there are variations. This is only a general outline of what you can expect the law to be in your state.</p>
<p>Because insurance companies have years of legal experience litigating the terms of their contract and knowing how standard 
terms have been defined by judges, carriers have the upper hand in drafting policies and selecting the language it finds most 
advantageous for making a profit. As a result American law routinely provides that should there be an ambiguity or uncertainty 
in a policy, an uncertainty in choice of wording or ambiguity in meaning would be resolved in favor of the policyholder and 
against the insurer. In the absence of a misrepresentation regarding coverage or exclusions, if the language of the policy is clear 
and explicit, it will be enforced. </p>
<p>Insurance contracts are interpreted by judges and courts to effectuate only the objectively reasonable expectations of the 
insured. Any personal, or subjective, expectation of a policyholder which cannot be reasonably supported by the language of 
the contract is unenforceable. So, it matters not what the policyholder/customer truly and honestly believes in his or her own 
mind. That subjective opinion is never in issue in a court of law. The real contest is to decide what the words of the policy 
mean to an objective person.</p>
<p>The guiding public policy routinely followed by our courts is that judges will seek to find and enforce coverage in case of a 
loss rather than defeat coverage. In other words, if there is a fair and honest interpretation that will result in the policyholder 
enjoying the benefit of the bargain, then so be it. Courts do not leaned over backwards to interpret a contract to create losses 
for policyholders.</p>
<p>So, when reading an insurance policy, the words selected by the insurance company are to be interpreted by judges according 
to their plain meaning. A plain meaning is one which an ordinary person would attach to such words, not as the meaning which 
might be utilized by an insurance company executive or an attorney.</p>
<p>Exclusions and limitations in a policy, because they often result in denying coverage when there is a loss, must be in clear and 
unmistakable language. It is for this reason that exclusions and limitations are always narrowly, or strictly, construed. If there is 
more than one meaning to be given to an exclusion or a limitation, the narrowest interpretation will be adopted by the court. 
Any exclusionary clause that is not clear and conspicuous will be interpreted in the interests of the insured.</p>
<p>In cases where a policyholder's lack of knowledge could result in the loss of benefits or the forfeiture of rights under a policy, 
an insurer is required to bring such fact to the insured's attention and to provide relevant information to enable the insured to 
take action to secure rights provided by the policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an insurance agent is not obligated to advise a policyholder on the adequacy of the limits of coverage selected 
by the policyholder. The term limits refers to the amount of insurance coverage. In the context of long-term care, the limits of 
coverage involve the actual amounts that will be paid on a daily basis for care and the length of time such benefits can be 
enjoyed by the insured.</p>
<p>What an agent says in terms of &quot;puffing&quot; or exclaiming the virtue of a policy is often not actionable, except in the circumstances 
where an agent assumes additional duties, has a special relationship of trust with the buyer, or holds himself/herself out as 
having special expertise, then a special duty arises. But when an insurance agent gives assurance of proper coverage and it 
turns out to be false, that agent will be held liable for negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>That is not to say that an insured can remain intentionally ignorant of the terms of a policy. An insured is not required to 
independently verify the accuracy of representations made by the agent regarding the policy and an agent can be held liable for 
intentional or negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>When an insurance policy contains provisions that are extremely one-sided in favor of the company, courts will find that the 
contract, or any portion of the agreement, was unconscionable at the time it was made and the court may refuse to enforce 
that provision. The basic test followed in most states is to ask in light of the general background and the needs of the particular 
case, whether the causes involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time the 
contract was made.</p>
<p>When an insurance company has used advertising and solicitation materials that are unfair or deceptive, some states provide 
legal protection to the policyholders and others do not. For example, the California Insurance Code prevents insurers from 
engaging in such conduct, but California law does not provide the policyholder with a private cause of action against the 
carrier. A policyholder may only have a cause of action for negligent or intentional misrepresentation against the agent selling 
such a policy as opposed to the a cause of action against the carrier who often times is more likely to be able to pay a 
judgment rendered by a court in favor of the policyholder. In cases, under California law, only the words in the actual policy 
are actionable and falsely written advertisements do not give rise to a cause of action against the carrier. policyholders must 
realize that the are buying the contract, not the advertising. </p>
<p><i>In bad faith: breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing </i></p>
<p>Every insurance contract contains an unwritten, invisible, or implied term referred to as the covenant or promise of good faith 
and fair dealing. In direct terms, this is a promise by an insurance company to always act in good faith and to act fairly 
towards its insureds in handling their claims. Whether or not such a clause is included in the policy, judges will read the policy 
as if it were there. Carriers must meet the reasonable expectations of the policyholder and an insurer must always give as 
much consideration to the financial interests of its insureds as it does to its own financial interests. </p>
<p>In bad faith cases a jury is always asked whether under the facts the carrier acted reasonably. Denying benefits, delaying 
payments and paying less than what is owed are examples of bad faith. An insurance company is obligated to thoroughly and 
promptly investigate all claims and must inquire into all the possible issues that might support an insured's claim. This obligation 
is not terminated simply because the insured files a lawsuit against the company.</p>
<p>Where an insurer makes a belated offer of settlement, a cause of action for bad faith does not correct or set aside the previous 
wrongful conduct. Any payments to the insured only reduce the amount of the insurance company's final liability as it may 
determined by a jury.</p>
<p>In a bad faith action an insurance company's business practices or common course of conduct is routinely admissible to show 
motive, opportunity, intent, plan, knowledge or the absence of a mistake or an accident in the manner in which it dealt with its 
insured. It is not necessary to show that the insurer intended to cause harm in a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing. The policyholder need only show that the insurer failed to honor the agreement and had no cause not to pay what was 
due under the contract.</p>
<p>When a person buys an insurance policy, the very risks that are insured against make it clear that if a claim is not satisfied the 
policyholder will suffer financial pressure and emotional distress. Policyholders obviously will be vulnerable to oppressive 
tactics by a carrier and insurance companies are presumed to know that a denial of benefits will very well result in emotional 
distress to their insureds. Damages that can be collected </p>
<p>Where a policyholder successfully shows that an insurer breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the insured can 
recover all damages caused by the breach. This includes all consequential losses, loss of use of the insurance proceeds, 
general damages, attorneys' fees and in cases of egregious and outrageous misconduct, punitive damages.</p>
<p>To recover for emotional distress it must be shown to have been caused directly as a result of the insurer's conduct. Normally, 
once actual economic loss is established, the policyholder is entitled to recover damages for emotional distress as well, as long 
as that injury was caused by the insurer's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <i>Time limits on filing suit</i></p>
<p>The statute of limitations in a bad faith case varies from state to state. A statute of limitations is the legal deadline after which a 
lawsuit cannot be filed. In most states, the two-year statute for personal injuries and emotional distress governs a lawsuit for 
bad faith. California has a one-year statute.</p>
<p>Many insurance policies impose a contractual obligation on the insured to bring any lawsuit within one year after breach of the 
contract, no matter what the rule is under state law concerning when a lawsuit can be lawfully filed. Calculating this one-year 
period, though, is not simple. Most states hold the time limit in the contract is enforceable but suspend the running of the 
one-year statute between the period of time the policyholder gives notice of the loss and the date on which the claim is denied. 
Caveat emptor: let the buyer beware</p>
<p>In the case of long-term health care, be very wary.</p>
<p>Remember, you are betting you will need long-term care and the carrier is betting it will not have to pay because of the 
language that it has included in &quot;its&quot; [not &quot;your&quot;] policy.</p>
<p>It is far wiser to use the right attorney to determine if a policy provides the care you believe you are purchasing now, rather 
than litigate once you are ill and in need of care. At that time you become an easy target for abuse by an insurance carrier that 
has a corporate life, i.e. one that will outlive us all. Obtain informed legal advice from the right lawyer at the outset. </p>

<p>The perils of purchasing long-term care insurance presented here is the compilation of the works of others. Those efforts have 
received limited circulation and certainly cannot be found today on the Internet. Any credit for this effort belongs to those 
listed below who have made their work freely available to the public. Any errors are those of the editor.</p>
<p>Special thanks and appreciation is owed by all consumers to the Commission on Consumer Affairs for New York for its 
efforts in reporting insurance fraud in New York, its leadership in exposing the hazards consumers face in the long-term care 
insurance market, its undercover investigation of sales practices, and it significant contribution to public education which 
provides the backbone of this effort to expand public knowledge. While the scope of the Department of Consumer Affairs of 
the City of New York focused on New York law and experiences in New York City, the result of the Department's 
investigation and warnings have universal application.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging's 1991 report on the Abuses in the Sale of Long-Term Care 
Insurance to the Elderly deserves special mention and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is to be 
commended for its efforts to enhance public awareness of the pit falls of long-term care insurance contracts.</p>
<p>I take personal responsibility for the legal analysis presented here, which only attempts to generally state the law of the various 
state, but otherwise my contribution as an editor has been to bring these issues and this information to the attention of the 
public through the Internet. Because this work is intended to assist the widest number of consumers, it is not copyrighted and 
as long as it is freely distributed, it may be copied and republished. In fact, such efforts are encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>February 1996 Addendum</strong> </p>
<p>Here's the response of an LTC agent: </p>
<p><a name="jan2">January 2, 1996</a> </p>
<p>I am a Long Term Care Specialist who recently read your WWW pages. Unlike most insurance agents, I write more 
premiums in a month then most agents do their entire careers. I found your material very objective, detailed and informative. I 
am in the process of developing my own WWW page and with your permission, I would like to link my web site with your 
&quot;Avoiding Fraud&quot; WWW page. </p>
<p>While reading your materials, I found myself agreeing with much of the information. Although, there were several areas I think 
you need to be more open minded to. One such area in where you infer that all agents are &quot;driven by substantial commissions&quot; 
and that the consumer is vulnerable to be taken advantage of. Yes, there are many slimy, unethical agents, just like there are 
many slimy, unethical lawyers. Not all of us are driven by commissions. There are many companies that pay very high 
commissions and I have chosen not to write the policies, simply because I don't feel comfortable with the contact language or 
the overall situation with the carrier. I currently receive between 35% to 45% first year commission. Many carriers pay 
upwards of 75%. Also, to compare agents who take orders for insurance (auto &amp; homeowners) with those who sell a 
product, because a need has to be developed, is unfair. Consumers don't walk into agent's offices and ask to buy LTC 
insurance. At least they don't where I live here in Florida. To infer that agents selling LTC insurance should be paid the same 
as those selling auto and homeowners insurance is like saying that a lawyer specializing in class action litigation should be 
compensated at the same level as the lawyer who chases ambulances or who is a public defender. I am sure O.J. would have 
preferred that option but I doubt Johnny &amp; F. Lee would have. </p>
<p>Overall, your other views about what a consumer should be aware of are valid and with merit. One of the biggest problems 
with most agents who sell LTC insurance is that they don't understand the definitions within the policies and they don't have 
the patience in dealing with the older consumer who needs to be thoroughly informed. Also, most agents don't understand the 
competition so they bash them or their products. Many agents generally over-insure or present a program that is far too 
expensive for the consumer. The agents need to take into account various financial considerations of the consumer, not simply 
apply a cookie cutter approach to selling the product. Most of my clients have chosen to self-insure a portion of their risk. The 
average age of my clients is 72 and the average premiums are $1,290. </p>
<p>When contract language is addressed, the consumer must clearly understand what it says. There are many insurance 
companies selling the product but, in my professional opinion, there are only 5 that I would consider recommending: 
(alphabetically) AMEX, CNA Fortis/Time, John Hancock &amp; The Travelers. Of these 5 companies I believe that Fortis/Time 
has the easiest to understand policy language. A consumer doesn't have to be a Philadelphia Attorney to understand it. I 
suggest you take a look at the policy. With so many companies entering and then exiting the marketplace, I think it is 
important that the consumer choose a company with stability and commitment to the market. In addition, the insurance 
company must have ample financial resources. Companies like Fortis/Time, John Hancock and The Travelers have well over 
$100 billion in assets. This is important to not only the premium stability but to the ability to pay claims 15 to 20 years from 
now, when claims start to escalate. I firmly believe that companies will increase rates in the future. I generally convey that to 
my clients. The question becomes, which company will have the lesser rate increase? It will be a lot more difficult for 
companies like Fortis, Hancock and Travelers to raise their rates compared to companies who maybe have less assets. If a 
consumer is 75+, Fortis/Time will Guarantee To Never Increase Rates. No other company that I am familiar with gives this 
guarantee! </p>
<p>I currently work with an Elder Care Attorney here in Florida. We have an excellent working relationship that is based on 
commitment, trust and, yes, referrals. He knows that I SPECIALIZE in LTC and I know he specializes in elder care law. I 
suggest your organization consider the same. Simply because an agent has a CLU, CFP, ChFC or any other designations, 
doesn't mean he/she understands the market. Many of us who specialize in LTC insurance are competent, knowledgeable and 
professional. And like you, we financially earn what we deserve. </p>
<p>In closing, yes, the consumer must be very wary when purchasing LTC insurance. I guess the same can be said when 
choosing an attorney. Lets face it, attorneys, insurance agents, and used-car salesmen are the bottom of the heap when it 
comes to consumer confidence. Like anything else, the consumer should obtain recommendations or referrals from other 
friends or professionals they trust. The should deal with professionals that understand their needs and desires and those who 
are truly concerned about their well-being. </p>
<p>In this world, we will come into it and leave it with only our name. If our name is not respected, then our life has been without 
meaning. </p>
<p>Thanks for your attention. </p>

<p>Elderly consumers who are shopping for long-term care insurance now have more financially strong companies to choose 
from, according to Weiss Ratings, Inc. of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. There are 12 long-term care insurers receiving a 
Weiss Rating of B+ or better today, as compared to four in 1992. Among the largest strong long-term care insurers are New 
York Life, rated A, Nationwide Life (B+), Principal Mutual Life (B+), Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity (B+) and John Hancock 
Mutual (B+). However, several long-term companies still receive a rating of D+ (weak) or lower, including Union Bankers 
Life (D). Low-rated companies carry a higher-than-average risk of failure, which, in some cases, could occur by the time the 
nursing home care is needed. With the cost of a simple two-year stay in a nursing home averaging about $96,000, the failure 
of a long-term care insurer could be a serious tragedy for elderly consumers, but it&#185;s easy to avoid this by shopping for 
policies strictly among the strong insurers. Weiss Ratings, Inc., an independent publisher of insurance company ratings, was 
the most accurate in identifying life and health insurers that subsequently became insolvent or financially impaired, according to 
the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO). Weiss publishes the Life and health Insurance Directory, as well as the HMO 
and Health Insurance Directory -- the only directory available which includes ratings and financial data on nearly all HMOs, 
Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies, life insurance companies and property/casualty insurers that write health policies. </p>
<p>Consumers may obtain a rating over the phone for $15 per company, or a one-page Personal Safety Brief for $25 and 
industry-wide directories for $219, from Weiss Ratings, Inc., 4176 Burns Road, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, 
1-800-298-9222.</p>

<p><i>First and foremost, what follows is not legal advice. That can only come from a qualified attorney who is familiar with 
all the facts and circumstances of a particular, specific case and the law in which that cases arises.</i></p>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the general law in the United States. By definition this explanation is flawed because there is 
no such thing as the general law of the United States. The law differs from state to state and while there are similarities, do not 
rely upon this article as legal advice. American law is driven by different fact patterns. Change one or two facts in a common fact 
pattern and the results may be different. In virtually all states the laws applying to the interpretation of the enforcement of 
insurance contracts follow common public policy themes, but there are variations. As a result this is only a general outline of what 
the law may be in any particular state.</p>
<p>Insurance companies have years of legal experience litigating the terms of their contracts -- contracts written by skilled lawyers 
which have been carefully upgraded as new decisions are handed down by appellate court. Coverage attorneys incorporate new 
case law into policies and regularly re-write their contract. Terms that may appear to a consumer to be simple English may have 
their origin in a legal opinion and may have been given a special interpretation. Because companies make it their business to 
know how standard terms have been defined by judges, carriers have the upper hand in drafting policies and selecting the 
language they find most advantageous for making a profit.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Insurance law routinely provides that should there be an ambiguity or uncertainty in a policy, an uncertainty in choice of wording 
or ambiguity in meaning would be resolved in favor of the policyholder and against the insurer. In the absence of a 
misrepresentation regarding coverage or exclusions, if the language of the policy is clear and explicit, the clear meaning will be 
enforced.</p>
<p>Insurance contracts are interpreted by judges and courts to effectuate only the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured. 
Any personal, or subjective, expectation of a policyholder which cannot be reasonably supported by the language of the contract 
is unenforceable.</p>
<p>It matters not what the policyholder/customer truly and honestly believes in his or her own mind. That subjective opinion is never 
in issue in a court of law. The real contest is to decide what the words of the policy mean to an objective person or a 
disinterested, common reader.</p>
<p>The guiding public policy routinely followed by our courts is that judges will seek to find and enforce coverage in case of a loss 
rather than defeat coverage. In other words, if there is a fair and honest interpretation that will result in the policyholder enjoying 
the benefit of the bargain, then so be it. Courts do not leaned over backwards to interpret a contract to create losses for 
policyholders. So, when reading an insurance policy, the words selected by the insurance company are to be interpreted by 
judges according to their plain meaning. A plain meaning is one which an ordinary person would attach to such words, not the 
meaning which might be utilized by an insurance company executive or an attorney.</p>
<p>Exclusions and limitations in a policy, because they often result in denying coverage when there is a loss, must be in clear and 
unmistakable language. It is for this reason that exclusions and limitations are always narrowly, or strictly, construed. If there is 
more than one meaning to be given to an exclusion or a limitation, the narrowest interpretation will be adopted by the court. Any 
exclusionary clause that is not clear and conspicuous will be interpreted in the interests of the insured.</p>
<p>In cases where a policyholder's lack of knowledge could result in the loss of benefits or the forfeiture of rights under a policy, an 
insurer is required to bring such fact to the insured's attention and to provide relevant information to enable the insured to take 
action to secure rights provided by the policy.Unfortunately, an insurance agent is not obligated to advise a policyholder on the 
adequacy of the limits of coverage selected by the policyholder. The term &quot;limits&quot; refers to the amount of insurance coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Unconscionability</strong></p>
<p>When an insurance policy contains provisions that are extremely in favor of the company, courts will find that the contract, or any 
portion of the agreement, was unconscionable at the time it was made and the court may refuse to enforce that provision. The 
basic test followed in most states is to ask, in light of the general background and the needs of the particular case, whether the 
causes involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p><strong>Liability for Advertising</strong></p>
<p>When an insurance company has used advertising and solicitation materials that are unfair or deceptive, some states provide legal 
protection to the policyholders and others do not. For example, the California Insurance Code prevents insurers from engaging in 
such conduct, but California law does not provide the policyholder with a private cause of action against the carrier. A 
policyholder may only have a cause of action for negligent or intentional misrepresentation against the agent selling such a policy 
as opposed to the a cause of action against the carrier who often times is more likely to be able to pay a judgment rendered by a 
court in favor of the policyholder. In cases under California law, only the words in the actual policy are actionable and falsely 
written advertisements do not give rise to a cause of action against the carrier. Policyholders must realize that the are buying the 
contract, not the advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Liability of Agents</strong></p>
<p>What an agent says in terms of &quot;puffing&quot; or exclaiming the virtue of a policy is often not actionable, except in the circumstances 
where an agent assumes additional duties, has a special relationship of trust with the buyer,or holds himself/herself out as having 
special expertise, then a special duty arises. But when an insurance agent gives assurance of proper coverage and it turns out to 
be false, that agent will be held liable for negligent misrepresentation. That is not to say that an insured can remain intentionally 
ignorant of the terms of a policy. An insured is not required to independently verify the accuracy of representations made by the 
agent regarding the policy and an agent can be held liable for intentional or negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p><strong>Duty to Deal Fairly with Insureds</strong></p>
<p>Every insurance contract contains an unwritten, invisible, or implied term referred to as the covenant or promise of good faith and 
fair dealing. This is a promise imposed by law upon an insurance company to always act fairly towards its insureds in handling 
their claims. Whether or not such a clause is included in the policy, judges will read the policy as if it were there.</p>
<p>Carriers must meet the reasonable expectations of the policyholder and an insurer must always give as much consideration to the 
financial interests of its insureds as it does to its own financial interests.</p>
<p>In bad faith cases a jury is always asked whether under the facts the carrier acted reasonably. Denying benefits, delaying 
payments and paying less than what is owed are examples of bad faith. An insurance company is obligated to thoroughly and 
promptly investigate all claims and must inquire into all the possible issues that might support an insured's claim. This obligation is 
not terminated simply because the insured files a lawsuit against the company. Where an insurer makes a belated offer of 
settlement, a cause of action for bad faith does not correct or set aside the previous wrongful conduct. Any payments to the 
insured only reduce the amount of the insurance company's final liability as it may determined by a jury.</p>
<p>In a bad faith action an insurance company's business practices or common course of conduct is routinely admissible to show 
motive, opportunity, intent, plan, knowledge or the absence of a mistake or an accident in the manner in which it dealt with its 
insured. It is not necessary to show that the insurer intended to cause harm in a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing. The policyholder need only show that the insurer failed to honor the agreement and had no cause not to pay what was 
due under the contract. When a person buys an insurance policy, the very risks that are insured against make it clear that if a 
claim is not satisfied the policyholder will suffer financial pressure and emotional distress. Policyholders obviously will be 
vulnerable to oppressive tactics by a carrier and insurance companies are presumed to know that a denial of benefits will very 
well result in emotional distress to their insureds.</p>
<p><strong>Damages that can be Collected</strong></p>
<p>Where a policyholder successfully shows that an insurer breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the insured can 
recover all damages caused by the breach. This includes all consequential losses, loss of use of the insurance proceeds, general 
damages, attorneys' fees and in cases of egregious and outrageous misconduct, punitive damages.</p>
<p>To recover for emotional distress it must be shown to have been caused directly as a result of the insurer's conduct. Normally, 
once actual economic loss is established, the policyholder is entitled to recover damages for emotional distress as well, as long as 
that injury was caused by the insurer's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limits on Filing Suit</strong></p>
<p>The statute of limitations in a bad faith case varies from state to state. A statute of limitations is the legal deadline after which a 
lawsuit cannot be filed. In most states, the two-year statute for personal injuries and emotional distress governs a lawsuit for bad 
faith. California has a one-year statute. Many insurance policies impose a contractual obligation on the insured to bring any 
lawsuit within one year after breach of the contract, no matter what the rule is under state law concerning when a lawsuit can be 
lawfully filed. Calculating this one-year period, though, is not simple. Most states hold the time limit in the contract is enforceable 
but suspend the running of the one-year statute between the period of time the policyholder gives notice of the loss and the date 
on which the claim is denied.</p>

<h2>National Database of Long-Term Health Care Providers </h2>
<hr>
<p>On May 12, 1995 the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice approved a proposal which would allow a subsidiary 
of Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest operator of nursing homes, to provide a nationwide database on services offered 
by nursing homes and other long-term health care facilities. In a business review letter to the subsidiary, Assistant Attorney 
General Anne Bingaman said that the proposal appears to meet a consumer need, and should promote competition by facilitating 
informed consumer choice.</p>
<p>The subsidiary, AdviNet, Inc., will develop a nationwide service database and contract with employers, insurers, associations 
and individuals to make such information available for specific geographic areas to employees, group members or individuals 
who call a toll-free telephone number. The database will include publicly available information on all licensed facilities, but more 
detailed information will be available from operators who become participating providers in the network. Participation will be 
open to any provider that meets objective health, safety and quality standards. Participating providers will be encouraged, but not 
required, to offer a discount to AdviNet customers. The amount of any discount will be for the provider to determine.</p>
<p>In addition to providing information on long-term care facilities in a geographic area, AdviNet will assist in scheduling site visits 
by customers. It will provide suggestions on what to ask and look for during those visits. The list provided to a customer will not 
be limited to participating providers, and AdviNet will not recommend any specific facility to the consumer.</p>
<p>AdviNet will operate independently of Beverly, in a separate office building, with a separate computer system. AdviNet's 
employees' compensation will not depend in any way upon selection of Beverly facilities by AdviNet customers. Specific pricing 
information received by AdviNet from any provider will not be made available to any other provider.</p>

<h2>The History of No-Fault: Voters Say &quot;No&quot; to So-Called &quot;Reforms&quot; 13 Out

<hr>
<p><a href="http://seamless.com/consumer/alerts.html"><strong>California (1996)</strong></a></p>
<p>Prop. 200's no-fault system for auto accidents would have eliminated Californians' right to trial by jury and their ability to collect 
non-economic damages. It was defeated 65-35 percent. Prop. 201 would have limited the right of investors to sue those who 
defraud them in stock swindles. It was defeated 59-41 percent. Prop. 202 would have arbitrarily capped plaintiff's attorney's 
fees at 15 percent of any early settlement offer. It was defeated 51-49 percent. </p>
<p><strong>Arizona (1994)</strong></p>
<p>Prop. 103 would have overturned the Arizona Constitution's guarantee against restrictions on citizens' right to recover damages 
and allowed the legislature to pass caps on awards and limit the right to trial by jury. It was defeated 61-39 percent. Prop. 301 
would have required periodic payments, allowed insurers to have unlimited access to hospital/physician records and denied 
damages to plaintiffs who were more than 50 percent at fault. It was defeated 62-38 percent. </p>
<p><strong>Michigan (1994)</strong></p>
<p>Prop. C, identical to Prop. B measure placed on the 1992 ballot, would have limited auto insurance medical benefits. It was 
defeated 61-39 percent. </p>
<p><strong>Michigan (1992)</strong></p>
<p>Prop. B would have limited medical benefits under auto insurance policies to $1 million, but would have allowed the insurance 
industry to sell additional coverage for expenses exceeding $1 million to policyholders. It was defeated 62-38 percent. </p>
<p><strong>Arizona (1990)</strong></p>
<p>Prop. 105 would have changed the Arizona Constitution and permitted limits on the right to sue and collect damages. It was 
defeated 83-17 percent. Prop. 203 would have allowed consumers to opt into a no-fault auto accident system. It was defeated 
85-15 percent. </p>
<p><strong>California (1988)</strong></p>
<p>Prop. 101 would have reduced bodily injury liability rates in auto cases by 50 percent and limited damages and contingency fees. 
It was defeated 86-14 percent. Prop. 104 would have enacted a no-fault auto insurance system. It was defeated 75-25 percent. 
Prop. 106 would have limited contingency fees in all tort cases to 25 percent of the first $50,000 of an award; 15 percent of the 
next $50,000; and 10 percent of any amount above $100,000. It was defeated 53-47 percent. </p>
<p><strong>Florida (1988)</strong></p>
<p>Amendment 10 would have arbitrarily capped non-economic damages in all tort cases at $100,000. Non-economic damages 
include jury awards for intangible harms such as blindness, sterility and gross disfigurement. It was defeated 57-43 percent. </p>

<hr>


<p>The &quot;Harvard Nurses Study,&quot; officially titled Silicone Breast Implants and Connective Tissue Disease, was conducted by 
researchers at Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
The study, first presented at the October 1994 meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and published June 22, 1995 
in The New England Journal of Medicine, claims that there is no association between silicone breast implants and connective 
tissue disease.</p>
<p>This study is seriously flawed and raises serious ethical issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two of the authors of the study, Dr. Graham A. Colditz and Dr. Matthew H. Liang, admitted under threat of perjury that 
they were paid consultants of breast implant manufacturers. </li>
<li>Dr. Colditz admitted under oath that he knew Dow Corning had donated $5 million to Brigham Women's Hospital. </li>
<li>Inappropriate scientific methodology was used. The information was gathered from questionnaires and conclusions were 
based on follow-up medical records. The women in the study were never examined by the researchers. </li>
<li>The number of women in the study was too small and the time period too short. Of the 87,501 women studied, only 
1,183 women had breast implants. The study included women who had intact, as opposed to ruptured, implants, as well 
as women who had had implants for as little as one month. By including women with such recent implants, the study 
erroneously concluded that the women would not become sick. Experts have determined that the latency period for 
connective-tissue disease is between 8 and 15 years after implantation. </li>
<li>Conclusions about silicone poisoning were based on &quot;classic auto-immune diseases&quot; and symptoms. But silicone poisoning 
is a new disease, which does not show &quot;classic&quot; autoimmune symptoms. </li>
<li>The National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Health held a symposium in March 1995 on &quot;The Immunology 
of Silicone,&quot; to discuss recent evidence of high cancer rates in women with silicone breast implants. Experts at the 
symposium concluded that exposure to silicone mammary implants sets into motion significant and long-lasting diseases 
with many immunopathic findings. </li>
<li>There is a demonstrated association between silicone from breast implants and connective tissue disease. The silicone 
stimulates the immune system, causing the body to attack itself. </li>
<li>These diseases include lupus (persistent ulcerous lesions that spread over the skin); scleroderma (an autoimmune disease 
causing hardening of blood vessels and connective tissue); Sjogren's disease (dryness in the eyes, mouth, nose, vagina); 
neurological problems such as numbness or tingling in the joints; problems with vision and hearing; silicone poisoning can 
also cause a fibrotic condition in the lungs which can lead to suffocation. </li>
<li>Even the authors of the Harvard study admitted, &quot;...the study cannot be considered definitively negative&quot; regarding the link 
between silicone and connective-tissue diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Harvard study claims to support the findings of a previous pro-breast implant report by the Mayo Clinic, the Harvard 
study's flaws are similar to the flaws in the Mayo Clinic study which examined a small group of women in a single area of 
Minnesota over a brief period of time, with no follow-up research performed. In addition, </p>
<ul>
<li>The Mayo Clinic study was partially funded by the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. </li>
<li>The authors of the Mayo Clinic study themselves admit: &quot;...our study has several limitations...Our results, therefore, cannot 
be considered definitive proof of the absence of an association between breast implants and connective-tissue disease.&quot; 
(New England Journal of Medicine, 6/16/94)</li>

<h2>Owens Corning's Fiberglas &#174;, Fiber Glass, Glass Fiber and GlassWool: A 
Carcinogen That's Everywhere - The Asbestos of the 21st Century</h2>
<h3>Rachel's Environment and Health Weekly [1]</h3>
<hr>
<p><font size=5>A</font>n industrial process for making glass fibers was first patented in Russia in 1840. [1,pg.292] At the Columbian Exposition in 
Chicago in 1893, Edward Libbey, an American, exhibited lamp shades, a dress, and other articles woven from glass fibers. In 
1915, the Allied Forces blockaded Germany and created an asbestos shortage which resulted in full-scale U.S. production of 
fiber glass as an asbestos substitute.</p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>sbestos is a naturally-occurring fibrous material that can be woven into cloth, does not burn readily, has excellent properties for 
thermal insulation, and therefore came into common commercial use during this century.[2,pgs.390-392] Fiber glass has many of 
the same characteristics as asbestos.</p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1938, the Owens Corning Fiberglas Company was formed, and three years later, in 1941, evidence of pulmonary disease was 
reported by Walter J. Siebert, who investigated the health of workers with the cooperation of Owens Corning.[1,pg.292] That 
same year another investigator reported finding &quot;no hazard to the lungs&quot; of workers exposed to glass fibers in the air. Scientific 
disagreement of this sort has characterized the study of fiber glass ever since; meanwhile fiber glass production has increased 
steadily.</p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1941, the U.S. Patent Office issued patents for 353 glass wool products. Glass wool, fiber glass, fiberglas, fibrous glass, and 
glass fibers are all names for the same thing: man made thin, needle-shaped rods of glass.</p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>iber glass is now used for thermal insulation of industrial buildings and homes, as acoustic insulation, for fireproofing, as a 
reinforcing material in plastics, cement, and textiles, in automotive components, in gaskets and seals, in filters for air and fluids, 
and for many other miscellaneous uses. More than 30,000 commercial products now contain fiber glass.</p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s asbestos has been phased out because of health concerns, fiber glass production in the U.S. has been rising. In 1975, U.S. 
production of fiber glass was 247.88 million kilograms (545.3 million pounds); by 1984 it had risen to 632.88 million kilograms 
(1392.3 million pounds).[1,pg.302] If that rate of growth (10.4% per year) held steady, then production of fiber glass in the U.S. 
in 1995 would be 436 million pounds.</p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>iber glass is now causing serious health concerns among U.S. officials and health researchers. Dr. Mearl F. Stanton of the 
National Cancer Institute found that glass fibers less then 3 microns in diameter and greater than 20 microns in length are &quot;potent 
carcinogens&quot; in rats; and, he said in 1974, &quot;it is unlikely that different mechanisms are operative in man.&quot; A micron is a millionth of 
a meter (and a meter is about three feet). Since that time, studies have continued to appear, showing that fibers of this size not 
only cause cancer in laboratory animals, but also cause changes in the activity and chemical composition of cells, leading to 
changes in the genetic structure in the cellular immune system. Although these cell changes may be more common (and possibly 
moreimportant) than cancer, it is the cancer-causing potential of glass fibers that has attracted most attention.</p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1970, Dr. Stanton announced that &quot;it is certain that in the pleura of the rat, fibrous glass of small diameter is a potent 
carcinogen.&quot; The pleura is the outer casing of the lungs; cancer of the pleura in humans is called mesothelioma and it is caused by 
asbestos fibers. Stanton continued his research and showed that when glass fibers are manufactured as small as asbestos fibers, 
glass causes cancer in laboratory animals just as asbestos does. [4] Asbestos is a potent human carcinogen, which will have killed 
an estimated 300,000 American workers by the end of this century. [5] The finding that fiber glass causes diseases similar to 
asbestos was chilling news in the early 1970s, and an additional 25 years of research has not made the problem seem less 
serious. Workers in fiber glass manufacturing plants are exposed to concentrations of fibers far lower than the concentrations to 
which asbestos workers were exposed, yet several industry-sponsored epidemiological studies of fiber glass workers in the U.S., 
Canada, and Europe have reported statistically significant elevations in lung cancers. [6]</p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), of the World Health Organization, listed fiber glass as a &quot;probable 
[human] carcinogen&quot; in 1987. In 1990, the members of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP)-representatives of 10 
federal health agencies-concluded unanimously that fiber glass &quot;may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen&quot; in humans. 
NTP members were preparing to list fiber glass that way in the Seventh Annual (1992) Report on Carcinogens, the NTP's annual 
listing of cancer-causing substances, which is mandated by public law 95-622. But industry intervened politically.</p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>our major manufactures of fiber glass insulation campaigned for three years to prevent their product from being labeled a 
carcinogen by NTP. They managed to delay the publication of the NTP's Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens for more than 
two years, but on June 24, 1994, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Donna E. Shalala, signed the Report and 
sent it to Congress, thus making it official policy of the U.S. government that fiber glass is &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a 
carcinogen.&quot; In the U.S., fiber glass must now be labeled a carcinogen.</p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>nnouncing this decision, government officials tried to play down its significance. Bill Grigg, a spokes-person for the U.S. Public 
Health Service (a subdivision of Health and Human Services) told the Washington Post ,&quot;There are no human data I'm aware of 
that would indicate there's any problem that would involve any consumer or worker.&quot; [7] To make such a statement, Mr. Grigg 
had to ignore at least six epidemiological studies showing statistically-significant elevations in lung cancers among production 
workers in fiber glass factories.[6] Indeed, according to researchers fiber glass is a more potent carcinogen than 
asbestos.[8,pg.580]</p>
<p><font size=5>F</font>iber glass is now measurable everywhere in the air. The air in cities, rural areas,[1,pgs.311-314] and remote mountain tops [4] 
now contains measurable concentrations of fiber glass. If the dose-response curve is a straight line (that is to say, if half as much 
fiber glass causes half as much cancer) and if there is no threshold dose (no dose below which the cancer hazard disappears), 
then exposing the Earth's 5.7 billion human inhabitants to low concentrations of fiber glass will inevitably take its toll by causing 
excess cancers in some portion of the population.</p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>ccording to OSHA researchers, an 8-hour exposure to 0.043 glass fibers per cubic centimeter of air is sufficient to cause lung 
cancer in one-in-every-thousand exposed workers during a 45-year working lifetime.[8,pg.580] In rural areas, the concentration 
of fiber glass in out-door air is reported to be 0.00004 fibers per cubic centimeter, about 1000 times below the amount thought 
to endanger one-in-every-thousand fiber glass workers.[1,pg.314] But people in rural areas breathe the air 24 hours a day, not 8 
hours. Furthermore, a human lifetime is 70 years, not the 45 years assumed for a &quot;work lifetime.&quot; Moreover, one-in-a-thousand is 
not adequate protection for the general public; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses one-in-100,000 or one-in-a-million as 
a standard for public exposures. (And in urban air, there's 10 to 40 times as much fiber glass as in rural air.) Therefore, the 
amount of fiber glass in the outdoor air in the U.S. and Europe (and presumably elsewhere) already seems higher than prudent 
public health policies would permit. Assuming a straight-line dose-response curve and no threshold, there is ample reason to be 
concerned about the human health hazards posed by fiber glass in the general environment.</p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>t has been 25 years since researchers at the National Cancer Institute concluded that fiber glass is a potent carcinogen in 
experimental animals. During that time, additional research has confirmed those findings again and again.[8] During the same 
period, the amount of fiber glass manufactured has increased rapidly year after year. Ninety percent of American homes now 
contain fiber glass insulation. All of this fiber glass will eventually be released into the environment unless special (and very 
expensive) precautions are taken to prevent its release. The likelihood of Americans taking such precautions is nil. Billions of 
pounds of fiber glass now in buildings will eventually be dumped into landfills, from which it will leak out slowly as time passes. 
Elevated concentrations of fiber glass are already measurable in the air above landfills today.[4]</p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1991, Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, a standard reference book on work-place safety and health, said about fiber 
glass, &quot;...it is prudent for industrial hygienists to treat these materials with the same precautions as asbestos.&quot; [1,pg.324] How do 
we treat asbestos? In the U.S., all new uses of asbestos have been banned. A ban of fiber glass is long overdue.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis C from Gammagard&#174;</h2>

<hr>


<p>In February, 1994 Baxter Healthcare Corporation withdrew from world markets Gammagard&#174;, an immunoglobulin 
administered intravenously to those with acquired or congential immune disorders, after 112 people in the U.S. were reported 
having symptoms of hepatitis C, the most fatal form of the this liver disease. Also withdrawn at the same time was a companion 
drug, Polygam&#174;, also an IGIV product.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver failure and is a recognized precursor to cancer of the liver, taking nearly 10,000 
Americans every year. The virus is particularly dangerous because even though a person is infected he/she may show no signs of 
any disease until many years later. In the meantime, the virus can be transferred to others, primarily by sexual intercourse. 
Anyone with hepatitis C is a considered a lifelong carrier.</p>
<p>Gammagard&#174; was introduced to the U. S. in 1986. It is made by extracting human proteins from plasma. Plasma is obtain from 
blood donors by centrifuging donated blood, separating the plasma and returning the red blood cells to the donor. Plasma donors 
can sell or provide plasma several times a week. Polygam&#174; differs only to the extent that it is made from American Red Cross 
plasma.</p>
<p>Gammagard&#174; was most commonly used in the treatment of children with leukemia.</p>
<p>Beginning in early 1994 Baxter learned that Gammagard&#174; recipients were being diagnosed with hepatitis. At that time Baxter 
withdrew both drugs due to possible contamination with hepatitis C virus.</p>
<p>Reports of hepatitis C infections in the U.S. spiked dramatically in March, 1994 among persons who had received 
Gammagard&#174; or Polygam&#174;. The Center for Disease Control reports that the &quot;absence of other risk factors among these 
patients&quot; indicates that hepatitis &quot;was most likely transmitted by administration of Gammagard&#174;.&quot; The Center is actively seeking 
people who have received Gammagard&#174; or Polygam&#174; between September 1992 and February 1994 and who probably have 
been exposed to contaminated product. Not everyone who received either gamma globulin product will develop hepatitis. Those 
who have been exposed to the Hepatitis C Virus through contaminated Gammagard have a 60-70% probability of suffering 
chronic hepatitis, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>For those who have been exposed, early diagnosis and treatment increases the chances for a positive outcome. The CDC has 
written medical care providers to notify Gammagard&#174; patients to be tested for hepatitis. It is unknown how successful that 
notification effort has been.</p>
<p>In May, 1994 Baxter was authorized by the FDA to sell a new, purified version of Gammagard&#174; now labeled as Gammagard&#174; 
S/D. The &quot;S/D&quot; designation refers to treatment of gamma globulin with solvents and detergents that sterilize the drug of viruses, 
including HIV and hepatitis.</p>
<p>Nationwide litigation has developed as a result of the injuries and exposures caused by this contaminated drug. Anyone who 
received Gammagard, whether or not that person has tested positive for hepatitis, probably has a claim and should not delay in 
taking action once they discover the IGIV they received was a Baxter product. In all cases of delayed injury, the statute of 
limitations presents a serious concern.</p>
<p>By way of a general explanation, which is not intended to be legal advice since that can only come from a lawyer who knows all 
the facts concerning a particular case or claim, statutes of limitations are in effect in every state in the United States. These laws 
require that a person who knows, or reasonably should know, that they have been injured must file suit within a limited time 
frame. The most common limit is two years, although several states, including California, have a one year statute of limitations. In 
cases where an action for damages is filed one day after the allowable period for filing suit, the wrongdoer is judgment proof 
because the statute provides a complete and total defense. Anyone believing they may have a valid claim should take immediate 
action to make sure they have filed suit before the running of the statutory period.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Defective Product Case</h2>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>A products case is won of lost in the early days following the accident, when the preliminary investigation must be initiated. This 
article will offer some suggestions on how to proceed in order to increase the client's chance of success. </p>
<p><strong>IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION </strong></p>
<p>The first priority is to call an experienced products liability attorney who will make sure that all evidence is preserved. Remember 
that the product must be secured immediately. Never be afraid to buy wreckage and if anyone should have second thoughts 
about buying a wrecked Bronco, a Jeep that rolled or a vehicle that has a gas tank that failed, keep in mind that it is 
comparatively inexpensive to buy a wrecked car, for example, compared to the value of a successful product liability case and if 
worse comes to worse it can be sold, but once it is lost it is gone forever. </p>
<p>Once you gain ownership of the defective product, lock it up in a facility that you control. Never assume that no one will want the 
wreckage of a destroyed automobile. In two cases against BMW alleging the gas tanks in models 1600 and 2002 were 
defective, the hulks mysteriously disappeared. In another case in which a four teenagers burned to death in a 1978 Dodge 
Ramcharger equipped with a plastic tank, an investigating service believed to have been retained by Chrysler offered to buy the 
burned hulk from the wrecking yard. In the case of the BMW, investigators for the car manufacturer photographed the evidence 
six months before the injured plaintiff retained his own attorney. Major manufacturers carefully read newspapers and whenever 
possible secure evidence to deny plaintiffs the ability to pursue claims. </p>
<p>If the evidence cannot be bought, at a minimum put everyone on notice, including owners, tow operators, wrecking yards, police 
impounds, and the like, that they must take every step to preserve important evidence and the failure to do so will subject them 
to being sued for allowing evidence to be destroyed. </p>
<p>When the product is in the possession of a third party or one of the anticipated defendants, immediately file an independent 
action for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to avoid alterations or destructive testing. The temporary 
restraining order should be carefully drafted so that anyone receiving notice of the order and in control of the article will be 
required to deliver it to the possession of a neutral person and to initiate preventive measures against damage in transit. </p>
<p>Next, obtain the complete history of the article. Determine the date of the original sale, identity of the dealer, distributor, 
subsequent purchasers, lessees and users. Locate the instruction booklet, assembly booklet, warranties and all other written 
material that accompanied the new product at the time of the original sale and distribution. Determine whether the article was 
modified or otherwise changed after it left the possession of the manufacturer and distributor and, if so, the identity of the persons 
or entities which made the modification and the dates involved. </p>
<p>Obtain the basic background data. This includes a complete description of the article, the manufacturer, distributor, sources of all 
component parts and all written materials pertaining to the product; advertising brochures, instruction booklets, technical data, 
parts manuals, repair manuals, operating manuals, catalogs, technical and lay advertisements, blueprints and diagrams of the 
article and component parts. </p>
<p>Buy two or more duplicate products for later testing and use at trial. Often designs and product literature will change or are 
simply not available as trial time draws near. Buying exemplars at the beginning of a case can pay important dividends later when 
the defendant manufacturer explains that the original engineering drawings no longer exist as a result of a corporate destruction 
program. If you own exemplars it does not matter if you do not have the original plans. </p>
<p><strong>DEFENDANTS </strong></p>
<p>The potential defendants in a products case include the manufacturer, assembler, component supplier, testing laboratories, 
advertising agencies, distributors, retailers and repairers. [see generally, 8 Pacific L.J. 865 (1977), 9 Univ. of Cal. Davis L. Rev. 
421 (1976).] </p>
<p>It is always important to name not only successor, but predecessor corporate manufacturers. [<i>Ray</i> v. <i>Alad</i> (1977) 19 Cal.3d 
22.] In some jurisdictions, a purchaser of an existing business does not assume the liability of a former corporation unless such 
liability is expressly assumed in a contract of sale or under circumstances where two corporate entities have merged. In these 
cases it is important to name the predecessor corporation. </p>
<p>In addition, bailors and lessors can be held strictly liable. <i>Foster</i> v. <i>Day and Zimmerman Inc.</i> (8th Cir. 1977) 502 F2d 867. 
An employer who manufactured the defective product for sale to the general public can be liable in tort. [<i>Bell </i>v. <i>Industrial 
Vangus, Inc.</i> (1981) 30 Cal.3d 268.] </p>
<p><strong>GOVERNMENTAL ASSISTANCE </strong></p>
<p>In proving the plaintiff's case, a plethora of federal and state statutes, regulations, and safety orders concerning a variety of 
products can assist.</p>
<p>The discovery of a violation gives the plaintiff's attorney an outstanding advantage. Not only may a statutory scheme such as the 
Consumer Products Safety Act, provide for a direct civil remedy, but counsel may also locate agencies concerned directly with 
the product which can serve as a basis for gathering further information. Federal statutes encompass aircraft, automobile 
equipment, boats and boating equipment, insecticides, medical devices, hazardous substances, highway safety, household 
refrigerators, packaging to protect children, mobile homes, motor vehicles, natural gas pipelines and occupational safety and 
health. </p>
<p>In California, as well as other states, the Legislature has provided standards for a broad range of products: animal fee, blood 
products, brake fluid, canned foods, barbecue charcoal, electrical power lines, excavations, fire extinguishers, flame retardants, 
bedding, ceramic tableware, fireworks, honey, water, paint, meat, milk, petroleum products, pipelines, cranes, trenches, plastic 
bags, radio-active materials, swimming pools and toys. In addition the California Division of Industrial Safety issues safety orders 
regarding aerial trams, boilers, compressed air, construction safety, electrical safety, elevators, mobile equipment, plant 
equipment, dangerous machinery, power transmission equipment, high voltage electricity, sawmills, mines, oil drilling, oil refining, 
ship building, tunnels and window cleaning. </p>
<p>State police or the highway patrol should be checked for regulations concerning the use and equipment of motor vehicles. Most 
state fire marshals issue fire safety standards and basic building design and construction standards. </p>
<p>Numerous federal agencies can help the attorney prepare the plaintiff's case. </p>
<p>The U.S. Consumer Products Safety commission is an independent federal agency whose main purpose is to reduce injuries. The 
Commission issues consumer product safety rules and can ban hazardous products. It maintains an Injury Information Clearing 
House to investigate and disseminate data relating to the cause of injuries associated with consumer products. </p>
<p>The National Technical Information Service of the U. S. Department of Commerce supplies a wide range of technical information 
and has a literature search service. </p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) publishes numerous regulations and pamphlets on workplace safety 
and health standards, the use of industrial substances, and safety in industrial and construction operations. </p>
<p>Another source for information on regulated substances is the Environmental Protection Agency, which has the authority for air, 
water and pesticide standards. </p>
<p>Information concerning standards for various products and materials is available from the Office of Technical Information and 
Publications of the National Bureau of Standards. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration should be contacted in cases involving food, drugs, medical devices or cosmetics. The FDA 
establishes the standards for regulated products and also has information on drug ingredients and food and drug manufacturing 
methods. </p>
<p>Electronic products which may emit radiation are regulated by the Bureau of Radiological Health, which has information 
concerning research, testing, and recall campaigns. </p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (tel. 800-424-9393, fax 202-366-7990) develops and issues safety 
standards for all new cars, conducts research on accident prevention, investigates motor vehicle defects and enforces notification 
of defects to owners of record. Numerous publications are produced by the Administration for consumers and their lawyers. The 
Federal Highway Administration is concerned with improving highway safety and conducts highway safety research relating to 
trucks and busses. The Transportation Research Board will conduct a computerized search and furnish abstracts of all 
engineering articles pertaining to highway topics. </p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard sets standards, makes factory inspections and conducts investigations of consumer complaints of 
defective boats. The Coast Guard notifies boat owners when defects are found. </p>
<p>Some other federal agencies that can assist the plaintiff's lawyer are the Federal Aviation Administration, the National 
Transportation Safety Board, and the Federal Fire Council. </p>
<p><strong>PRIVATE SOURCES OF PRODUCT INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>Take advantage of the enormous amount of safety and accident prevention information published by insurance organizations. The 
Factory Mutual Engineering corporation of Norwood, Massachusetts, publishes a catalog of books, pamphlets and films on the 
prevention of industrial accidents and data containing technical information for preventing losses by fires, explosions and 
machinery accidents. </p>
<p>The American Insurance Association maintains an engineering and safety service and has pamphlets concerning a wide range of 
accident prevention topics. </p>
<p>Technical and scientific information can be located in several indices which contain references to scientific books, articles and 
reports on almost every product manufactured. The Applied Science and Technology Index, Engineering Index, and Science 
Citation Index should be checked. </p>
<p>The National Safety Council, National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, American Chemical 
Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Water Works Association, and the Manufacturing Chemist's 
Association all have scientific and technical data. </p>
<p>The Center for Auto Safety (202-328-7700) in Washington D.C., the Transportation Safety Department of Calspan in Buffalo, 
New York, and the Highway Safety Research Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan, all do research in the field of automobile design. 
The Society of Automotive Engineers in Warrendale, Pennsylvania, maintains a complete library on automobile components and 
safety standards. </p>
<p><strong>EXPERT ADVICE </strong></p>
<p>The search for product information is often an arduous task and in many cases will be assigned to an expert in the field. Finding a 
qualified expert at the outset is usually the major factor in successfully proving the plaintiff's case. </p>
<p>Although a university professor may make an excellent witness, the skilled technician or mechanic should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>Lists of experts in various fields can be purchased from the California Trial Lawyers, San Francisco Trial Lawyers and the Los 
Angeles Trial Lawyers Associations. The <i>Jury Verdict Reporter</i>, in addition to its monthly report of verdicts, publishes a 
valuable semiannual index of all experts who have testified during the preceding six months. The list is indexed by name and field 
and is cross-referenced to the reported verdict. Should a particular expert interest you, speak with the attorney for whom the 
expert testified. Determine the nature and extent of the expert's qualifications and his or her impact on the jury. </p>
<p>A literature search can usually provide a list of potential experts on the esoteric subjects or, at a minimum, will lead to qualified 
experts willing to consult with attorneys. In a recent case involving a vintage fire hose coupling which failed when placed under 
pressure, all identifying marks had been obliterated by use and the manufacturer was unknown. A literature search uncovered a 
San Diego author, an expert on fire hose coupling threads, who was able to identify the small Wooster, Ohio, manufacturer from 
a photograph of the coupling. After service the manufacturer admitted that the coupling had been originally designed with set 
screws to prevent failure, but this safety device had not been utilized until after field complaints confirmed the need for this 
feature. This information flowed from a few hours in the library and a telephone call and short letter to the author. </p>
<p>Often a competitor of the defendant manufacturer will refer you to a recently retired employee &quot;with forty years experience in the 
field&quot; who is now consulting. While many such persons can never shake their &quot;company&quot; orientation, they are useful for referrals 
to other qualified persons in the industry. </p>
<p>A patent search also can be a source of potential experts, and most patent files contain numerous references to industry data not 
catalogued or otherwise indexed. In a recent case involving the loss of an eye from a chip of metal from a backhoe tooth, a 
technical manager of the original patent explained the thirty year history of the product and how the accident backhoe tooth was 
never intended to be cast as a single piece and that this manufacturing method was in fact responsible for the plaintiff's blindness. </p>
<p>In addition to utilizing engineering testimony, consideration should also be given to psychologists or experts specializing in the field 
of human factors. On occasion a strict engineering approach fails to consider that a product must be designed so that people can 
safely use it. A bio-mechanical analysis can reveal a hidden trap for the unwary user or a practical way to prevent injuries. In a 
case against the manufacturer of a defective industrial switch that exploded and spewed burning oil, a human factors consultant 
envisioned an inexpensive safety lock that could be added to the existing design at little cost and which would have prevented the 
plaintiff's catastrophic injuries. </p>
<p>In appropriate cases, testing, either destructive or nondestructive, may be necessary to determine whether there is evidence that 
the product failed or could fail in the manner theorized by the plaintiff. </p>
<p><strong>APPROACHES TO DISCOVERY </strong></p>
<p>The plaintiff's expert should also help determine exactly what information needs to be developed or obtained in the course of 
discovery. </p>
<p>Carefully drafted interrogatories can be a strong tool to perfect the plaintiff's claim. Interrogatories should identify and locate 
blueprints and diagrams of the product and component parts, the materials used in manufacture and their suppliers, a breakdown 
and analysis of the manufacturing and quality control processes, the schedule of inspecting and testing of the product, patents and 
patent applications, dealer bulletins, advertising materials, trade journals and scientific journals. </p>
<p>In some instances, a manufacturer may have an indexing system to all its records. In the birth control pill litigation with Searle 
Company, manufacturer of Enovid, Searle denied that one of the known side effects what thrombophlebitis. In the course of 
discovery a computer printout listing complaints from doctors about the side effects was located which referred to numerous 
complaints of thrombophlebitis. </p>
<p>Interrogatories should also obtain information pertaining to subsequent design or manufacturing changes, since evidence of 
subsequent changes is admissible in products litigation. [<i>Ault</i> v. <i>International Harvester Co.</i> (1975) 13 Cal.3d 113.] </p>
<p>Interrogatories must identify pertinent standards issued by engineering associations concerning the product in question and locate 
the complete accident history file for the product and other similar models, and information concerning any other lawsuits. 
Counsel should determine if the manufacturer maintains a safety committee and whether or not minutes of discussions exist. 
Determine if there is a regular document destruction program and, if so, what documents have already bee n destroyed. </p>
<p>Interrogatories should identify each person connected with the design not only of the product in question but of similar products, 
including employees of the manufacturer and others consulted concerning the design. Reasons for selection of the design in 
question from alternates should be explored, as well as a description of safety features, the persons designing such safety features 
and all subsequent testing of safety features. Information regarding safety devices known to a manufacturer but not used should 
also be obtained. Much testing goes on during designing and a description of each test conducted with all test records should be 
elicited from the defendants. Counsel should also determine the intended use of the product when the design was originally 
considered and the contemplated conditions under which the product was to be operated. </p>
<p>Often answers to interrogatories will provide you with an opportunity to gain access to valuable test data and interoffice 
memoranda. During the MER/29 litigation against Richardson-Merrell Company, a number of skeletons were found hiding in 
corporate file drawers. [See <i>Toole</i> v. <i>Richardson Merrell</i> (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 689.] MER/29 was developed and 
marketed to help reduce blood cholesterol. One side effect was the appearance of cataracts on the eyes of some users, which 
led to partial loss of sight in some cases. </p>
<p>Over a thousand personal injury claims were eventually filed. In the course of discovery a memorandum detailing cataracts in 
laboratory dogs and monkeys was found. The fact that Richardson-Merrell had concealed this knowledge was proved through 
interoffice memos obtained through discovery. </p>
<p>When doctors began to realize the side effects of MER/29 they were contacted by Richardson- Merrell employees. One 
interoffice memorandum advised a Richardson-Merrell employee to respond to a complaining doctor by cooperating with him in 
hope that it might keep him from publishing before Richardson-Merrell could &quot;snow&quot; him with data from other sources. </p>
<p>In a 1974 Paris air crash 345 people were killed when an aircraft baggage door opened unexpectedly. Detailed discovery was 
the key to the plaintiff's success. Two years before the accident, in June 1972, one of the defendant's engineers wrote a memo 
stating: </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;the fundamental safety of the cargo door latching system has been progressively degraded since the program began in 
1968. The airplane demonstrated an inherent susceptibility to catastrophic failure when exposed to explosive 
decompression of the cargo compartment in 1970 ground tests.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>The Pinto case is another important example. [<i>Grimshaw</i> v. <i>Ford Motor Co.</i> (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 757, 791-792.] In this 
case internal Ford engineering studies concluded that the cost of paying victims for injuries and deaths would be less expensive 
than installing a device that could help prevent gasoline from escaping from vehicles in collisions. This famous &quot;Grush&quot; memo, 
named after its author, was the basis of a $127 million punitive damage award. </p>
<p>These documents also prove the truth of litigator's adage that &quot;the paper does not lie.&quot; Every successful product liability case 
rests on a solid foundation of thorough discovery of internal corporate records, which can provide unimpeachable, convincing 
proof of liability. </p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION </strong></p>
<p>Because product liability cases require detailed preparation, an early determination of potential liability is essential before 
expensive discovery is undertaken. The importance of promptly securing the defective product and fully utilizing inexpensive 
sources of product information can reduce the cost of litigation and at the same time provide valuable aids for establishing 
liability. </p>

<h2>Ending Secrecy In Defective Product Litigation:</h2>
<h3>New Federal Reporting Rule for Consumer Products</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>
<hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">The Alexander Law Firm</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com], a medium size law firm specializing in individual and class action litigation arising from negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, mass accident, environmental and fraud cases on behalf of consumers and small businesses.

<hr>


<p><font size=5>M</font>anufacturers of consumer products, as of January 1, 1991, are required to report to the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission settlements in cases involving &quot;grievous bodily injury or death&quot; caused by defective products. The new legislation, 15 
U.S. C. 2084, is an important advancement for consumers, since former regulations were vague and easily avoided. Previous 
rules only required a manufacturer report when it believed a product was defective or posed a substantial risk of injury. As a 
result, few manufacturers of consumer products reported and CPSC enforcement was extremely difficult. </p>
<p>The new requirement is part of a growing trend to avoid the sealing of court records and the concealment of litigation arising from 
consumer products that cause serious injuries: mutilation, amputation, dismemberment, disfigurement, loss of bodily functions, 
debilitating internal disorder, severe burns and electric shock and any injury which required extended hospitalization. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, nobody knows how many defective product personal injuries cases are actually filed each year in the United States 
and the number of major injury and death cases that are settled and sealed also is unknown. Locating court files on such cases is 
virtually impossible, unless a defendant truthfully answers interrogatories. </p>
<p>But now every manufacturer of a consumer product, in order to avoid enforcement action by the CPSC, must monitor personal 
injury and death claims for the purpose of reporting its product experience to the federal government. Within every consumer 
product manufacturing company, someone must be designated and given the responsibility for collecting claims data and 
determining whether or not it is subject to the reporting rules. As a result, &quot;more accurate&quot; answers to product litigation history 
interrogatories should be forthcoming. Unfortunately the new statute does not cover products under the auspices of the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, namely passenger vehicles, and is restricted solely to consumer products under the 
jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. </p>
<p>The threshold reporting requirement occurs whenever, during a two year period, three cases, filed in either state or federal court, 
result in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff or a final settlement. When a third action is settled or judgment entered, the 
manufacturer must within thirty days report to the CPSC. Thereafter, every subsequent settlement or judgment in that 24-month 
period must be reported within thirty days. The 24-month period commences January 1, 1991 and ends December 31, 1992. 
The next two year reporting period will begin January 1, 1993. </p>
<p>When information is required to be reported to the CPSC with regard to a concluded civil action, the manufacturer must provide 
the following minimum report: </p>
<p>a. Name and address of manufacturer; </p>
<p>b. The model and model number or designation of the consumer product which was the subject of the civil action; </p>
<p>c. A statement as to whether the civil action alleged death or grievous bodily injury, and in the case of an allegation of grievous 
bodily injury, a statement of the category of such injury. </p>
<p>d. A statement as to whether the civil action resulted in a final settlement or a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. </p>
<p>e. In the case of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the name of the civil action, the number assigned the civil action, and the court 
in which the civil action was filed. </p>
<p>In addition to this required information, most manufacturers will probably take advantage of the statute's provision to provide 
&quot;any other information which the manufacturer chooses to provide&quot; especially if it is exculpatory, such as the plaintiff's 
comparative fault, product misuse, claimed extenuating circumstances, or whether any judgment is under appeal or is expected to 
be appealed. </p>
<p>If this statute is to be effective, practitioners must be careful to plead that the product caused &quot;death or grievous bodily injury,&quot; in 
order to trigger the reporting requirements. Judicial Council form complaints should be amended in products liability actions to 
include, on page three under the category of &quot;other damage,&quot; the statutory language and a description of the categories of injury 
described in the statute (mutilation, etc.). </p>
<p>As part of any pre-filing investigation, counsel should contact the Consumer Product Safety Commission to obtain records of all 
defective product settlements and judgments involving the product and all related products by the same manufacturer, since such 
cases will invariably also be reported as defective product investigations, independent of the statute and such records are public 
documents available for purchase from the CPSC. </p>
<p>Since the statute fails to require the identification of plaintiffs, courts, and action numbers in cases of settlements, initial 
interrogatories in product liability cases should also be amended to include an inquiry concerning the defendant's reporting history 
under the 15 U.S.C. 2084 to the CPSC for the purposes of identifying further avenues of discovery and to identify the employee 
responsible for collecting data and reporting to the CPSC. Once any cases are reported under this new statute a defendant will 
not be able to deny specific knowledge or thereafter avoid producing complete identification of the case for plaintiff's counsel. </p>
<p>It is clear that compromises were negotiated by the National Association of Manufacturers in the final statutory language. Under 
the new statute the amount of a settlement paid by a manufacturer is not required to be reported and, as expected, the reporting 
of a civil action &quot;does not constitute an admission of unreasonable risk of injury, a defect in the consumer product which was the 
subject of such action, a substantial product hazard, an imminent hazard, or any other admission of liability under any statute or 
under any common law.&quot; </p>
<p>For the purposes of this reporting statute, a particular model of a consumer product is one that is distinctive in functional design, 
construction, warnings or instructions related to safety, function, user population, or other characteristics which could affect the 
product's safety related performance. </p>
<p>With increased reporting to the CPSC, the Commission will have greater access to the tremendous investigative power of the 
plaintiffs' bar and increased product safety will result. </p>
<p>But before any of this happens, plaintiffs' counsel must included in every products liability complaint an allegation of &quot;grievous 
bodily injury or death.&quot; Without this effort the statute will remain largely inoperative and ineffective. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>
<p>Under the proposed $4.25 billion settlement of the national class action brought by recipients of silicone gel breast implants that 
is presently pending before U.S. District Court Judge Sam Pointer in Birmingham, Alabama [Silicone Gel Breast Implant 
Multi-District Litigation Action No. 926], the Claims Administrator has begun the task of compiling an initial report on the 
number of persons who have submitted documented applications to the Current Disease Settlement Fund prior to the September 
16, 1994 deadline and the severity of the reported injuries. </p>
<p>This critical stage in the case will test the accuracy of previous estimates of the number of claimants and the distribution of claims 
across the range of disease categories, known as &quot;the grid.&quot; The grid, a matrix of compensation categories, sets forth a hierarchy 
of diagnoses and severity of injury by diagnosis on the vertical axis and the age of onset of symptoms on the horizontal axis. The 
resulting categories of proposed compensation on the grid range from $1.4 million [most severe injury and the youngest age of 
onset of symptoms] to $105,000 [lowest level of injury and oldest age of onset]. </p>
<p><strong>The Plaintiffs' Task </strong></p>
<p>The task now facing class action counsel is to make the adjustments that will be necessary between several proposed settlement 
fund categories [ongoing disease, explanation, implant recipient, diagnosis/evaluation, rupture, and attorneys' fees] and the grid 
categories and to determine whether the proposed settlement fund is sufficient. Once this analysis is concluded, if funding is 
insufficient to provide class members with acceptable individual recoveries, members will be afforded a second opportunity to 
opt-out of the settlement, unless additional funds are made available. There is broad agreement that additional contributions will 
be necessary if a nationwide settlement is to become a reality. </p>
<p>Our firm's experience illustrates the current dilemma. Of 238 breast implant recipients represented by The Alexander Law Firm, 
following a detailed analysis of individual medical records, laboratory tests and extended physical examinations, three 
independent rheumatologists evaluating this randomly selected group of women have documented that 119 have histories and 
symptoms that qualify as grid beneficiaries. According to the current grid, compensation for these class members alone totals 
nearly $36,000,000. If this experience is indicative of the total population of qualified class members and their expectations, 
additional contributions to the settlement fund will be necessary or the number of opt-outs will generate an avalanche of individual 
actions unprecedented in the history of the United States. </p>
<p>Clearly the most financially responsible potential contributors to the settlement fund are Dow Chemical Company of Midland, 
Michigan, an industrial colossus, and Corning Corporation. Neither is a contributor to the settlement fund because they are no 
longer parties to the litigation. Judge Pointer dismissed alter ego claims against Dow Chemical and Corning Corporation, the 
parents of Dow Corning Corporation, and temporarily saved them from exposure to general liability and punitive damages, 
leaving the lesser funded subsidiary solely liable for Dow Corning breast implants and generating rumors that it would be forced 
to seek bankruptcy protection. The decision initially was viewed as a setback for plaintiffs, but it was made without prejudice to 
bringing Dow Chemical and Corning Corporation back into the case if facts so warranted. </p>
<p>Obviously the prospect of successfully completing the proposed settlement is enhanced with Dow Chemical and Corning 
Corporation contributing to the settlement fund. As a result, since March, 1994 intensive discovery has focused on Dow 
Chemical's and Corning's relationship to Dow Corning. That effort has resulted in the identification of new documents, previously 
unknown to the plaintiffs, which will be the basis of a motion to reinstate these parties as defendants to be heard possibly in 
January, 1995. Should the Court find there are triable claims against Dow Chemical and Corning Corporation both will be 
brought to the bargaining table. </p>
<p><strong>The Case Against Dow Chemical </strong></p>
<p>Newly discovered evidence, detailed in a masterful motion to rejoin Dow Chemical and Corning Corporation as defendants in 
Michigan&thorn;s Wayne County Circuit Court by colleagues David Black and Douglas Peters, reveals previously unknown 
agreements between Dow Chemical and Dow Corning uncovered by MDL leaders Rick Ellis, Doug Peters and Ernie Hornsby 
which show that Dow Chemical had responsibility for researching the bioreactivity of silica and silicone compounds used in Dow 
Corning breast implants from 1943 until 1992 and for controlling the quality of the products manufactured, distributed and sold 
by Dow Corning, including silicone breast implants. As a result of both independent and joint research projects with Dow 
Corning, Dow Chemical knew as early as the 1950's that the silicone and silica in Dow Corning's breast implants were 
bioreactive, immunogenic, toxic and inflammatory in the human body. </p>
<p>Based on this evidence, plaintiffs claim Dow Chemical is liable on the theories of direct products liability, negligent performance 
of an undertaking, negligent misrepresentation and joint venture liability. Here in summary form is the substance of the motion by 
Brothers Peters and Black and the stunning violation of the public trust that has been uncovered by the plaintiffs' team. </p>
<p><strong>The New Evidence </strong></p>
<p>Dow Chemical's direct involvement with Dow Corning's products began in 1943, the year of Dow Corning's incorporation, 
when Dow Chemical agreed to provide Dow Corning with its technical expertise [including all plans, specifications, formulas, 
data, and information] and royalty free licenses under all patents in the field of organo-silicon products. Dow Chemical also 
agreed to supply Dow Corning with all newly discovered technical information until 1958. Dow Chemical also undertook 
responsibility for researching the bioreactivity of silicone compounds on behalf of Dow Corning and continued to do so until as 
late as 1992. <i>Dow Corning relied on Dow Chemical's expertise in the silicone field to such an extent that Dow Corning 
did not perform a single study on a breast implant before an implant was inserted into a woman&thorn;s body. </i></p>
<p>On another silicone track, Dow Chemical entered into a secret agreement in the 1960's to develop a product line of pesticides 
and insecticides from components of the silicone gel used in Dow Corning's breast implants. </p>
<p>In 1966 and 1967, Dow Chemical and Dow Corning entered into a series of express joint agreements for the purpose of 
research, development, evaluation and commercialization of biologically active silicone compounds. The first such agreement was 
on July 13, 1966, when Dow Chemical entered into a &quot;secrecy agreement...with Dow Corning Corporation on biological 
properties of silicones.&quot; On October 1, 1966, Dow Chemical entered into a second &quot;agreement... covering research and 
development in the field of physiological effects of certain organosilicon compounds.&quot; On February 1, 1967, Dow Corning 
entered into yet another &quot;joint research agreement with the Dow Chemical Company pertaining to certain silicone products 
designated as DC-555, DC-555A, and compounds derived from and related thereto...&quot; The two corporations also reached </p>
<ul>
<li>(a) joint development agreement relating to the physiological effects resulting from ingestion or injection into the systems of 
animals or men of particular physiologically active silicones, wherein in principle, the parties shall jointly share the costs and 
shall share the profits and losses of any commercialization. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, on December 5, 1967, Dow corning entered into an agreement &quot;with the Dow Chemical Company providing for joint 
research, development, evaluation and commercialization programs on the physiological effects upon the systems of animals or 
man of physiological active organosilicon compounds.&quot; </p>
<p>Pursuant to these agreements and for a period of nine years, the Dow Bioscience Research Center performed numerous 
experiments into the biological and pharmacological effects of silicone components of breast implants on animals and humans. 
Research from these joint enterprises produced results that silicones were not bio- inert. <i>This research was never published</i>. 
When the first evidence of silicone bioreactivity was discovered in the California trial of <i>Hopkins v. Dow Corning</i>,[1] hearings 
were convened by the FDA which resulted in the withdrawal of silicone gel implants from the market in 1992. </p>
<p>Consistent with these involvements, the scientists of Dow Chemical and Dow Corning shared a remarkable community of 
interest, particularly between the 1965-1975 time frame. These scientists commonly and frequently would exchange both 
knowledge and experience with each other. They shared laboratories and facilities to research the effects of low molecular 
weight organosilicon compounds, like those found in both Dow Chemical&thorn;s DC-555 fluid and Dow Corning&thorn;s silicone get 
breast implants. Dow Corning modeled its toxicology department after Dow Chemical&thorn;s laboratory pursuant to a letter by Dr. 
Groggin. In 1975, Dr. Robert Lake, a Dow Corning scientist, presented research showing that silicone was not bio-inert at a 
joint conference between Dow Corning and Dow Chemical&thorn;s scientists. In fact, the need and common interest of both 
corporations to study the bioreactivity of organosilicon compounds was so great that the exchange of scientists from one 
corporation to the other occurred through the entire time Dow Corning was in existence. </p>
<p>The relationship between Dow Corning and Dow Chemical was further solidified in 1975 when the two corporations entered 
into a Trademark Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, Dow Chemical admitted that it has &quot;controlled...the quality of its [Dow 
Corning&thorn;s] goods&quot; since 1943. More specifically, the agreement provided: </p>
<ul>
<li>The products manufactured, distributed and sold -- shall be of a nature and quality that is acceptable to Dow 
Company...When requested, associate companies shall... submit specimens of its products to Dow Company and shall 
permit inspection of associate companies&thorn; premises. . . to examine the quality of such products. </li>
</ul>
<p>In 1989, Dow Chemical agreed to perform a &quot;Good Laboratory Practices&quot; audit on Dow Corning. Finally, in 1990, Dow 
Corning reached an agreement with Dow Chemical to advise and consult them in toxicology laboratory practices and protocols. </p>
<p>In 1948, a seminal Dow Chemical research report was published by two Dow Chemical employees, Dr. Rowe and Dr. 
Spencer, in combination with a Dow Corning employee, Dr. Bass, which declared silicone to be <i>&quot;biologically inert</i>.&quot; This 
placed Dow Chemical in an authoritative position as the leader in silicone research.[2] </p>
<p>The importance of bio-inertness is well explained in the August, 1994 supplement to Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ideal biocompatible materials are devoid of immunological, inflammatory, or toxic reactions, resist deterioration of host 
tissues or the biomaterial, limit alteration of host proteins, and are noncarcinogenic. Silicone was promoted for clinical 
application because it was thought to be biologically inert. (David Borenstein, Toxicology of Silicone). </li>
</ul>
<p>However, by the 1950's, Dow Chemical and Dow Corning had performed studies which demonstrated toxic hazards associated 
with Dow Corning silicone; The first known study was in September of 1954, when Dr. Spencer of Dow Chemical reported that 
Dow Corning silica (this silica being the beginning and end product of silicone gel) had &quot;quite a high order of toxicity from dust 
inhalation.&quot; </p>
<p>In March of 1955, Dr. T. K. Rowe of Dow Chemical reported that Dow Corning Degussa Dust (fumed silica added to the 
elastomer shell to strengthen the implant) caused diffuse cellular infiltrates and fibrocystic changes in the lungs and organs of 
animals. </p>
<p>Dow Chemical learned specifically that the silicone used in breast implants was not bio-inert in 1956 when Dow Chemical 
studied the biological effects of Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4). D4 became the building block of the gel used in silicone 
breast implants from the 1960's until they were taken off the market in 1992. The 1956 study found that the compound, if 
administered orally or by intramuscular injection, led to traces of siloxane being found throughout the bodies of laboratory 
animals. The study also found the the compound caused a &quot;slight initial weight loss and moderate liver pathology. </p>
<p>A similar 1956 Dow Chemical study determined that D4 had a biological effect on the eye and that contact would cause painful 
and transient irritation of the conjunctival membranes. In fact, there were at least nine separate Dow Chemical reports of test 
results on Dow Corning Silicone Fluid. All of these reports indicate some irritation to the eyes and skin. One particular report 
indicates the silicone fluid caused hyperemia, edema, and general skin rawness in all cases. Some of the tests reported the 
biological effects of Dow Corning Fluid 360, which is &quot;chemically the same silicone formula utilized in many aspects of breast 
implants.&quot; </p>
<p>In 1956, Dow Chemical initiated a research project with University of Miami, on behalf of Dow Corning. Dow Chemical 
negotiated the price of the project and determined what testing would be performed. When the test results found that a Dow 
Corning silicone compound entitled Z-4141 caused fat or silicone deposits in the livers of laboratory rats, Dow Chemical (not 
Dow Corning) retested the results. The results of these retests indicated the deposits found in the rats' livers represented silicone, 
not fat. Although the final report published by the University of Miami referenced several employees at Dow Chemical, no 
mention was made of the Z- 4141 compound. . </p>
<p>In 1957, Dow Corning sent Dow Chemical reports that Dow Corning 200 Fluid was &quot;absorbed through the skin by the adrenal 
and kidneys of a rabbit.&quot; </p>
<p>In 1961, Dow Chemical tested Dow corning Fluid and found a substantial difference in the fluid when it was heat treated. 
Specifically, the fluid caused death in all but one of the rats, apparently because of &quot;irritation of the respiratory tract.&quot; </p>
<p>In 1970, Dow Chemical discovered that Dow Corning 360 Fluid caused spontaneous death in several rats, pulmonary 
deposition, and vacuoles [cavities] to develop in the liver, heart, kidney, spleen, pancreas, ovary, adrenal and stomach mucosa. 
Also in 1970, Dr. Olson, a Dow Corning scientist newly transferred from Dow Chemical, reported that &quot;if there is any leakage of 
the [breast implant], by diffusion, rupture, or by any means, some frequency of allergic reactions of patients will occur. In some 
cases, the problems posed are likely to be serious.&quot; </p>
<p>In 1975, Dr. Lake's study, which showed significant silicone bioreactivity, was presented to a joint conference between Dow 
Corning and Dow Chemical scientists. <i>This research was never published. </i></p>
<p>Finally, in 1976, employees from Dow Corning and Dow Chemical studied the effect of implantation on the physical properties 
of silicone rubber. The study found that the subcutaneous implantation [as is performed in mammary augmentation or 
reconstruction] changed the physical properties of medical grade silicone rubber. </p>
<p>Although it is clear from the above studies that Dow Chemical knew as early as the 1950's that the silicone used in breast 
implants <i>was not </i>biologically inert, neither Dow Chemical nor Dow Corning ever published the results of any of this research. In 
fact, Dow Chemical indicated just the opposite to the public -- that silicone was bio-inert and safe for human use. In 1954, and 
again in 1959, Dow Chemical promoted the suitability of silicone products for medical uses. In October of 1974, product inserts 
indicated that silicone breast implants were &quot;nonreactive to body tissue.&quot; The General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel, in a 
letter to the FDA which contains public information, declared that &quot;. . . although one pathologist has been widely quoted as 
claiming that he has found silicone in various organs of the body, we are not aware of any other medical professional who has 
observed this phenomenon.&quot; Finally, in 1992, the CEO of Dow Chemical, Frank Popoff, declared that Dow Corning's breast 
implants were &quot;beyond reproach.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>Dow Chemical had responsibility for researching the bioreactivity of silica and silicone compounds used in Dow Corning breast 
implants. Dow Chemical knew as early as the 1950's that silicone and silica used in Dow Corning's breast implants was 
bioreactive, immunogenic, toxic and inflammatory when introduced into the human body. The company did nothing to advise the 
public of these hazards or to stop the sale, despite the fact that Dow Chemical had the right to control and in fact controlled the 
quality of the products manufactured and sold by Dow Corning. </p>
<p>Every consumer injured by a breast implant owes a well deserved &quot;thank you&quot; for the effort in uncovering this public fraud. 
Clearly Dow Chemical and Corning Corporation will argue their own analysis of this evidence. Notwithstanding what they may 
claim, the evidence is indeed compelling. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that this violation of public trust should not go 
unpunished and that Dow Chemical should be held liable for the harm it has caused and most assuredly could have prevented. </p>

<hr>
<p>As the scientific evidence piles up, linking chemical exposures to serious human diseases, many chemical-dependent industries, 
such as pesticide purveyors, are searching for a strategy to buy themselves some time, to put off the inevitable. They needn't look 
far. The tobacco industry has demonstrated that 40 years of scientific bad news can be deflected and neutralized with relative 
ease. Roughly half-a-million Americans die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, and this assessment is not disputed by the 
federal government, or by thousands of scientific researchers and physicians, or by the nation's mainstream medical and health 
organizations. Yet the tobacco corporations have successfully maintained their privilege of selling a product that kills 10% of 
everyone who uses it as directed. What is the secret of such success? </p>
<p>A key component of the tobacco strategy is scientific research, funded by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which 
was formed in 1954 and later was renamed the Council for Tobacco Research <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Scientific research sponsored by the Council 
has served to create and maintain a &quot;scientific controversy&quot; surrounding questions of tobacco and health. The Council has funded 
studies of questions such as, Do some people have a genetic predisposition to cancer? Scientific controversy about 
tobacco-and-health gives the tobacco industry &quot;plausible deniability&quot; (a phrase made famous by Richard Nixon in another 
context). Scientific controversy allows the tobacco industry to insist that the case against their product in not conclusive. And it 
gives tobacco corporation executives the wiggle room they need--to deny that they are cut from the same cloth as drug dealers 
and murderers. For example, an official of the Tobacco Institute (an industry trade organization) said in 1987 -- 33 years after 
the American College of Surgeons identified smoking as major cause of lung cancer -- &quot;Smoking may cause illness; it may not. 
We don't know and we don't think anybody knows.&quot; <a href="#2">(2)</a> </p>
<p>We call this phenomenon &quot;cigarette science.&quot; Cigarette science is scientific study that serves the needs of a particular industry that 
finds itself beset by scientific bad news. One such industry is the pesticide trade. </p>
<p>The pesticide corporations have formed their own cigarette-science group called RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound 
Environment). RISE is made up of executives from companies like Monsanto, Sandoz Agro, DowElanco, Dupont Agricultural 
Products, The Scotts Company, and other pesticide manufacturers, formulators, and distributors. </p>
<p>The issue that has RISE's members worried is multiple chemical sensitivity, or MCS. MCS is an adverse reaction to low levels of 
many different chemicals with symptoms that range from sniffles to coma. Typical symptoms include irritability, insomnia, difficulty 
concentrating, memory trouble, daytime grogginess, chronic fatigue, headache, joint pain, muscle pain, abdominal pain, 
constipation, and ringing in the ears. In sum, for an MCS patient, life is hell. MCS afflicts 10% to 15% of the American public, 
and appears to be increasing, according to a publication of the American Chemical Society.<a href="#3">(3)</a> Pesticides and solvents are the 
chemicals mentioned most often as causes of MCS. For example, a recent article in Environmental Health Perspectives (a 
scientific journal published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a federal agency) says MCS is a 
&quot;syndrome with onset related to an environmental exposure, most commonly a solvent or pesticide.[Emphasis added.] After the 
initial exposure, individuals become sensitive to low-level chemical exposures with symptoms involving more than one organ 
system. Though this syndrome was described four decades ago, it remains highly controversial.&quot; <a href="#4">(4)</a> Keeping MCS controversial 
is a key task of the cigarette-science activities of RISE. So long as MCS is surrounded by scientific controversy, the pesticide 
industry has wiggle room to make statements such as this recent one by RISE regarding MCS: &quot;There is no scientific or 
documented evidence that pesticide application when used in accordance with label instruction has caused harm to human 
health.&quot; <a href="#5">(5)</a> </p>
<p>RISE's 1995-96 Strategic Plan (provided to us by the MCS advocacy group, MCS Referral &amp; Resources [phone: (410) 
448-3319]) describes 4 main objectives. Objective #3 is &quot;To promote the use of industry products as valuable pest management 
tools to enhance the quality of life and the environment.&quot; For achieving Objective #3, the RISE Strategic Plan identifies two 
&quot;tactics&quot; to be used by its &quot;Communications Committee:&quot; First, &quot;Host forum for industry user groups that are taking positive 
pesticide messages to schools.&quot; And, second, &quot;Conduct two 'MCS' phenomena seminars.&quot; </p>
<p>On September 9, 1995, RISE sponsored a seminar on MCS. One of the speakers was Suellen W. Priages, managing director 
of a brand new organization, the Environmental Sensitivities Research Institute (ESRI). ESRI is a new cigarette-science institute 
funded by chemical-dependent corporations &quot;to 'proactively' respond to the rising number of&quot; MCS cases. <a href="#6">(6)</a> Notice how the 
name of the institute shifts the problem from one of 'multiple chemical sensitivities' to one of 'environmental sensitivities.' The 
problem isn't chemicals, it's the environment. Executive director and founder of ESRI is Ronald R. Gots, who openly scoffs as 
MCS patients and the physicians who treat them. For example, Dr. Gots has said MCS is &quot;a peculiar manifestation of our 
technophobic and chemophobic society.<a href="#7">(7)</a> In other words, MCS patients aren't really sick -- they're just irrationally frightened 
by technology and chemicals. </p>
<p>Dr. Gots wears another hat, as director of National Medical Advisory Service (NMAS), which provides expert witnesses to 
attorneys defending corporations in product liability lawsuits. ESRI and NMAS are essentially indistinguishable; they share the 
same offices and have the same fax number; Dr. Gots heads both. ESRI and NMAS promote the same viewpoint toward MCS: 
it is an imaginary or psychological phenomenon, not an illness, so it couldn't be caused by chemicals. For example, on September 
15, 1995, Dr. Gots testified on behalf of a corporate defendant in a lawsuit, saying under oath, &quot;The MCS theory has been 
subjected to peer review evaluation and it has generally been rejected as 'junk science.'&quot; <a href="#8">(8)</a> </p>
<p>Dr. Gots himself has had some recent work subjected to review by one of his peers, and it was found wanting. His recent book, 
Toxic Risks: Science, Regulation and Perception was thoroughly trashed by a reviewer in the Journal of Occupational 
Medicine--an industry-dominated journal. Dr. Gots's book was described as &quot;of little value to public health professionals and 
scientists&quot; and &quot;replete with sweeping generalizations, over statements, and exaggerations.&quot; <a href="#9">(9)</a> </p>
<p>Despite the obvious anti-MCS bias of Dr. Gots and his anti-MCS organizations, a respected university and the federal 
government are now allowing themselves to become a vehicle for Dr. Gots's political agenda. October 30 through Nov. 1, Johns 
Hopkins University in Baltimore -- one of the nation's top research institutions, particularly in public health -- in conjunction with 
NIOSH [National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, a federal agency] -- is co-sponsoring a symposium with Dr. 
Gots's National Medical Advisory Service, assisted by the staff of the Environmental Sensitivities Research Institute. The 
symposium is called &quot;Multiple Chemical Sensitivities: State-of-the-Science Symposium.&quot; As you might expect from a group that 
doesn't believe there is any valid science supporting diagnoses of MCS, the symposium is heavily weighted in favor of 
pro-industry, anti-consumer, anti-MCS-patient viewpoints. No attempt is being made by conference organizers to include or 
accommodate MCS patients. </p>
<p>A ticket to the conference costs $625, and no scholarships are being offered to MCS patients, so their viewpoints on their illness 
will be missing from the conference. The viewpoint of the pesticide, carpet, perfume, and chemical industries -- as represented 
by Dr. Gots and his colleagues -- will receive a stamp of approval from NIOSH and from one of the nation's most prestigious 
universities. Thus does a major university slide into a role as provider of a public relations platform, and cover, for cigarette 
scientists promoting the anti-scientific agenda of the pesticide and petrochemical industries. </p>
<p>In the Baltimore area, MCS sufferers and people concerned about the integrity of science are outraged by Johns Hopkins 
University's capitulation to chemical-dependent industries, and they are planning a protest outside the OMNI-Inner Harbor Hotel 
in Baltimore at 8:30 am October 30th. In honor of Halloween, organizers of the protest are urging MCS patients to come 
dressed as &quot;An MCS Patient's Worst Nightmare -- an anti-MCS witness in a white lab coat masquerading as an unbiased MCS 
researcher.&quot; </p>
<p>In contrast to the anti-MCS bias dominating the conference sponsored by Johns Hopkins and its friends in the pesticide industry, 
some excellent scientific work is underway to find the causes of MCS. Recent work published in mainstream scientific journals 
indicates that MCS is a disease related to the olfactory (sense of smell) nerves in the nose. This nerve system provides a pathway 
for chemicals to pass directly into the brain. Chemicals traversing this path may affect the limbic system in the brain, which in turn 
influences both the endocrine and immune systems and also influences a person's moods.<a href="#10">(10)</a> Other recent scientific work 
implicates another mechanism in causing MCS -- inflammation of body tissues caused not by the immune system (which often 
causes inflammation to fight disease), but by a mechanism called &quot;neurogenic inflammation.&quot;<a href="#4">(4)</a> A great deal of controlled 
scientific experimentation is going on now to test these hypotheses. </p>
<p>In the end, good science will prevail. But in the meantime, millions of peoples' lives have been ruined by MCS. Worse, the Johns 
Hopkins/NIOSH conference has been designed by cigarette scientists to prolong the misery. </p>

<hr>


<p>A major breakthrough in understanding the toxicological impact of multiple chemical exposures has been discovered by 
researchers at Texas Southwestern Medical School and the Duke University Medical Center. </p>
<p>The discoveries may have a profound impact on the manufacturing, testing and warnings required for all chemicals sold in the 
United States. </p>
<p>While U.S. law requires manufacturers report the acute symptoms and immediate first aid treatment for an overdose exposure 
to chemicals used in industry, as well as household products, the symptoms caused by chronic or low level, long-term 
exposures are rarely mentioned in MSDS and the reports of interactions caused by other chemicals are non-existent. </p>
<p>For example, in the course of discovery in a lawsuit arising from an unusual cluster of four leukemia deaths in a group of 200 
Simpson Lumber Mill employees in Arcata, California, pentacholorphenol manufactured by Champion International and sold 
under the name of Woodlife, was used as a wood preservative and eventually proven to have high levels of dioxin. See <a href="lumber.html">Dioxin 
In Pentachlorophenol: A Case Study Of Cancer Deaths In The Lumber Industry</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that the manufacturer's technical staff was well aware of the chronic effects of exposure to this compound, 
Champion International never advised purchasers of Woodlife, or their employees, to be alert for an evidence of acne that 
was commonly associated associated with individuals working in the application of Woodlife, or reports of rashes, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, excessive perspiration, conjunctivitis or crusting of the eyes, depression or memory loss, 
insomnia or irritability, tingling or numbness in the extremities, blood in the urine or stool, burning sensation in the trachea or 
bronchi, nose bleeds, asthma-like symptoms, altered liver function, kidney or bladder infection or complaints, immune 
complaints, ongoing infections, children born with abnormalities, low sperm count, soft tissue sarcomas, unexplained fevers or 
night sweats, herpes sores or any skin disturbances below the eyes, at the temples or at the back of the neck or ears. </p>
<p>These symptoms are common signs of low level exposure to pentachlorophenol contaminated with dioxins and should not be 
confused with common conditions that have similar symptoms, such as colds or flu. </p>
<p>In fact these symptoms were commonly reported by Simpson Lumber Company employees, but no one ever made the 
connection between these symptoms and pentachlorophenol contaminated with dioxin until after plaintiffs' lawyers uncovered 
the fact Simpson had concealed the widespread use of pentachlorophenol from state department of health authorities. </p>
<p>Rarely can an MSDS be found that discusses harm from chronic exposures and equally rare is any mention of the synergistic 
effect of chemicals. Open any of these Material Safety Data Sheet sites to confirm that fact: </p>
<ul>
<li>Material Safety Data Sheets at Oxford University, UK -- <a href="http://physchem.ox.ac.uk:80/MSDS">http://physchem.ox.ac.uk:80/MSDS</a> </li>
<li>Material Safety Data Sheets at Case Western Reserve -- <a href="http://research.nwfsc.noaa.gov/msds.html">http://research.nwfsc.noaa.gov/msds.html</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Synergism is the simultaneous action of separate agencies which, together, have greater total effect than the sum of their 
individual effects. The phenomenon is readily seen in the impact of drugs, but never mentioned on Material Safety Data Sheets 
required for the sale of toxic chemicals in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
<p>A recent breakthrough in the understanding of Gulf War Syndrome may be changing scientific thinking and promoting further 
research on chemical synergy. </p>
<p>Researchers at the Duke University Medical Center and the Texas Southwestern Medical School reported in April, 1996 that 
the simultaneous exposure to topical insecticides [DEET and permethrin] and pyrido-stigmine bromide, a drug taken 
prophylactically to counteract toxic gas warfare agents, causes nervous system damage in chickens. The full written report is 
scheduled for publication in the May,1996 issue of the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. </p>
<p>Both the team led by Robert Haley at Texas Southwestern and Modhamed Abou-Donia's group of researchers at Duke 
found that the many symptoms experienced by Gulf War veterans, including headaches, fatigue, aches, decreased attention 
and rashes, were similar to the symptoms that presented in exposed chickens. </p>
<p>Chickens given any two chemicals became lethargic, unable to fly, lost weight and coordination and demonstrated tremors. 
For those administered all three chemicals, paralysis and death occurred. </p>
<p>This observed impact on nerve functioning is significant because survivors of the Gulf War who were exposed to these toxic 
agents also have demonstrated abnormal nerve function. </p>
<p>Further studies of Gulf War veterans who were exposed are being conducted at Texas Southwestern and are focusing on 
comparisons between physical findings in humans and those found in exposed chickens. </p>
<p>The results of that work is awaited by veterans, who until now, have been unable to show any relationship between their 
multiple symptoms and their exposures during the Gulf War. </p>
<p>More significantly, if these discoveries prove correct all manufacturers of commercial and household chemicals will be 
obligated to begin testing and instituting warnings of the synergistic effects of their products with other commonly used 
chemicals. </p>
<p>It is this new testing that holds promise for a better understanding of the impact of chemicals on health that has long been 
advocated by environmental activists, occupational health specialists, recipients of breast implants, those exposed to 
chlorinated hydrocarbons and sufferers of multiple chemical sensitivity. </p>
<p>Addendum July 22, 1996<br>
<br>
The research of Steven F. Arnold and others at Tulane University published in June, 1996 shocked the scientific community. It 
proves that hormone-disrupting chemicals, known to cause mild effects, when used in combination produce significantly 
dramatic hormonal effects &quot;Synergistic Activation of Estrogen Receptor with Combinations of Environmental Chemicals,&quot; 272 
Science 1489-1492 (June 7, 1996).</p>
<p>Combinations of two or three pesticides, which are commonly found in the environment at low levels, are up to 1600 times 
more powerful than any of the pesticides individually in their impact on hormones.</p>
<p>Some chemicals, which individually do not disrupt hormones, tremendously magnifies the ability of other chemicals to disrupt 
hormones. That was the finding with chlordane.</p>
<p>The study focused on endosulfan, chlordane, toxaphene and dieldrin, all of which impact a gene making estrogen in animals. 
Estrogen controls the formation and development of female organs and is strongly associated with both breast cancer and 
causing male sex organs to be deformed.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a revolution in scientific knowledge that will profoundly effect the way pesticides are screened and 
tested.</p>
<p>This research should prompt EPA to immediately require appropriate warnings. Regulations have long been based on studies 
of individual chemicals and their individual effects. Now EPA must take steps to regulate combinations of chemicals in order 
to assure appropriate levels of public safety. </p>
<p>The policy implications of the synergistic effect of chemicals will cause a top to bottom re-vamping of chemical regulations. 
For years, EPA has not tested pesticide products as sold in containers in combination with other chemicals.</p>
<p>The example of chlordane is particularly disturbing because it means that EPA, manufacturers and the scientific community 
must now assess and evaluate of chemicals long believed to have minor hormonal impacts. Accomplishing such testing will 
take years and all the while significant damage to people will continue unabated.</p>
<p>The prevailing view that chemicals are safe until proven otherwise is no longer valid and all manufacturers must be required to 
prove the safety of their products when used in conjunction with other chemicals.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we must reduced the wide variety of chemicals used today and eliminate the use of pesticides until proven 
safe.<br>

<p>A major break through in understanding the effect of dioxin exposure was published in December 1995 by Dieter Flesch-Janys 
and others, &quot;Exposure to Polychlorinated Dioxins and Furans (PCDD/F) and Mortality in a Cohort of Workers from 
Herbicide-producing Plant in Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany,&quot; 142 American Journal of Epidemiology 1165-1175 
(December 1, 1995). Dr. Flesch-Janys reports a significant in finding: a dose-relationship between dioxin and cancer and heart 
disease mortality for workers of a pesticide manufacturing plant located in Hamburg, Germany that had produced phenoxy 
herbicides including 2,4-D, chlorophenols, and other herbicides and insecticides known to be contaminated with dioxins and 
furans for a period of thirty-two years. </p>
<p>We report here a case study of millworkers in Northern California and the facts discovered in four lawsuits which support and 
confirm the hazard presented by dioxins to industrial workers and the challenge of proving such cases two decades after 
exposure. </p>
<p><a name="intro"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></a> </p>
<p>The actual proof of dioxin exposure was in a fat sample taken from Tim Skaggs who died of leukemia in 1991 at age 40, having 
been exposed to Woodlife during the years 1971-72 while employed by Simpson Lumber Company in Arcata [Humboldt 
County; county seat Eureka], California. </p>
<p>In an investigation of three other leukemias at the Simpson mill by the State Department of Health, Simpson concealed from 
officials that for years it had used wood preservatives with pentachlorophenol. As a result the State Department of Health 
concluded this cancer cluster arose from unknown causes. </p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm, in light of the scientific literature concerning the generation of dioxins in the manufacturing of 
chlorinated hydrocarbons and the proven relationship between dioxins and soft-tissue sarcomas, undertook an expensive and 
detailed investigation which began with an in depth analysis of pentachlorophenol and other lawsuits in the United States. See A 
Developing Toxic Tort: Lumber Mills, Log Cabins, Leukemia, Lymphomas and Soft Tissue Sarcomas - The Case Against 
Pentachlorophenol, 21 CTLA Forum 195 (1991). </p>
<p>In a three year investigation and numerous interviews of mill workers, many of whom had no recollection of Tim's part-time work 
on the paint line where Woodlife was applied twenty years ago, a retired paint line operator confirmed that Woodlife had been 
used in painting machines, but he had no recollection of Tim working there. Although Simpson's mill records no longer existed, its 
purchasing agent confirmed it had purchased Woodlife by the barrel from Champion International. Champion's sales manager 
during the 1960s and early 1970s testified that Woodlife was sold to Simpson's Arcata plant for use on the paint line. To prove 
Tim's exposure, a fat sample was taken from his abdomen by a Stanford plastic surgeon and analyzed for dioxins and furans 
suspected to have contaminated Woodlife by Triangle Laboratories Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. </p>
<p>After an extensive search, a twenty year old can of pentachlorophenol was located and tested, revealing an 80% correlation 
between the pattern of dioxins found in Tim's fat and those found in the sample product. </p>
<p>The following is a detailed report of the facts and scientific conclusions reached in these cases by our expert and legal team. </p>
<p><a name="background"><strong>BACKGROUND: SKAGGS V. CHAMPION INTERNATIONAL</strong></a> </p>
<p>Tim Skaggs, [born on March 5, 1950] died on October 17, 1991 from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Tim worked for Simpson 
Lumber Company at its Arcata mill starting at age 21. His initial employment as a night shift laborer resulted in his working at 
various jobs, including assignments to the paint line department where he handled and sawed lumber treated with Woodlife, a 
wood preservative manufactured and sold to Simpson by Champion. </p>
<p>Woodlife's principal ingredient was pentachlorophenol which was contaminated with dioxins and furans, the most carcinogenic 
chemicals known to man. Pentachlorophenol is an known and established carcinogen and is so listed by the State of California as 
a Proposition 65 cancer causing agent. It was Tim's exposure to this dangerous and defective chemical during the period 1971 
through late 1972 that caused Tim's leukemia and that of his co-workers at the Arcata mill. The diagnosis of leukemia in Tim 
some 17 years after being exposed to this known carcinogen was consistent with the latency period for this type of chemically 
induced cancer. </p>
<p>Although this action sought to hold Champion liable for negligence in not warning about the hazards of this product, which 
Champion knew was being handled improperly by its customers, and for breach of warranty, the primary legal basis for this 
action was for selling a defective product. </p>
<p>Tim is survived by his high school bride, Virginia, who was born on March 24, 1950 [now age 43] and two children, his son 
Clifford born September 16, 1969 [age 23] and Kristina born January 16, 1971 [age 22]. </p>
<p>The investigation of Tim Skaggs' leukemia was initiated by his personal physician Dr. Alan Glasseroff. The State Department of 
Health's report of that investigation documented three leukemias [of which Timothy Skaggs was one] and one non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma at the Arcata plant. It concluded: A statistically significant 16-fold increase in the acute leukemia rate and 7-fold 
excess for combined acute leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma rate were calculated. We cannot rule out that this cluster 
could have happened by chance though the probability of a chance occurrence is very low.&quot; Evaluation of A Potential Cluster of 
Hematopoietic Cancers among Workers in a Wood Manufacturing Mill in California, California Department of Health Services, 
Berkeley, April 23, 1990.[emphasis added] </p>
<p><a name="carcinogen"><strong>THE CARCINOGEN PENTACHLOROPHENOL</strong></a> </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol is an extremely dangerous carcinogen when it is used to preserve wood. Environmental Health Criteria 71, 
Pentachlorophenol, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1987, pp. 11-12. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol has been used for years to preserve telephone poles, fence posts, and water-exposed decking. In the 1960's 
it was introduced to preserve finished mill work, siding, casements, mullions, and to treat perimeter wall logs in log home kits 
marketed to the public. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol is a halogenated hydrocarbon, composed of a benzene ring to which is attached a hydroxide radical making a 
phenol which is then chlorinated. By-product contaminants of the process include tetrachlorophenol, hexachlorobenzene and 
various dioxins and furans. These chemicals are without any doubt the most toxic chemicals ever known to mankind. 
Grandstanders such as the late Californian Assemblyman B. T. Collins may drink malathion in front of television cameras to 
demonstrate the claimed safety of this insecticide, but nobody ever voluntarily places oneself in contact with any material that has 
even 1 part in 1,000,000,000,000 of dioxin, because it is a proven carcinogen. </p>
<p>Hexachlorodibenzodioxin appeared in commercially produced pentachlorophenol in the United States during the 1970s in 
amounts ranging up to 100 parts per million. As the toxicology evidence will unfold at trial, concentrations at this high level are 
outrageously dangerous. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol by itself is a known and proven carcinogen. It is readily absorbed by the lungs, skin and stomach. While there 
may be differences in the biological response of rabbits and humans to 10% solution of pentachlorophenol, the probable oral and 
dermal lethal doses for a 150 pound person, based on the animal toxicity literature, are 1.09 ounces orally and 4.4 ounces 
dermally. Very little is needed to kill. </p>
<p>The body absorbs PCP and discharges it in a number of ways. While much of it is excreted in urine, it accumulates in tissues, 
particularly muscle, bone marrow, and fat. Braun, et al., The Pharmokinetics and Metabolism of Pentachlorophenol in Rats 
[1977], Toxical. Appl. Pharmacol. 41:395-406. That is where it does long term damage to the formulation of blood cells. </p>
<p>The &quot;no effect&quot; and &quot;lethal&quot; dose limits of pentachlorophenol are not greatly different. For example, at a dose of 80 milligrams per 
kilogram, no experimental animals died. At a dose of 100 milligrams 83% died and at 110 milligrams 100% died. Kehoe, et al., 
Toxic Effects Upon Rabbits of Pentachlorophenol and Sodium Pentachlororphenate [1959], J. Ind. Hyg. Tox. 21: 160. This is 
important to understand: substantial amounts of pentachlorophenol can be absorbed with no observable effect. </p>
<p>German literature reports health problems due to residential exposure to PCP. Brandt and Schmidt, in an article entitled 
Chronische Lebererkrankung durch langjahrige Intoxikation im Haushalt mit Pentachlorophenol [1977], Deutschen Gesellschaft 
fur innere Medizin, pp. 1609-11, reported fluctuating abnormal liver enzymes directly associated with moving into and out of a 
dwelling which had its interior treated with PCP. Later, Gebefugi reported health problems associated with residential interior 
exposure to pentachlorophenol. Gebefugi, et al., Occurrence of Pentachlorophenol in Enclosed Environments [1979] 
Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety 3:269-300. </p>
<p>The health effects observed in both the occupational and residential exposures, especially those related to the skin and 
respiratory tract are best explained by laboratory findings involving immune system studies of laboratory animals. In a series of 
experiments reported in the early 1980's, Nancy Kirkvliet, et al., found that technical grade pentachlorophenol causes immune 
suppression in animals which she has linked to dioxins contained in pentachlorophenol and found that hepta and hexa dioxin are 
implicated. Kerkvliet, et al., Humoral Immunotoxicity of Polychlorinated Diphenyl Ethers, Penoxypheols, Dioxins and Furans 
Present as Contaminants of Technical Grade Pentachlorophenol [1985], Toxicology, 36:307-24 (see extensive articles cited). </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol was first known as a carcinogen in 1978. Greene, et al., Familial and Sporadic Hodgkin's Disease Associated 
with Occupational Wood Exposure, The Lancet, September 16, 1978, pp. 626-27; Goldstein, et al., Effects of 
Pentachlorophenol on Hepatic Drug/Metabolizing Enzymes and Porphyria Related to Contamination with Chlorinated 
Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzo-Furans [1977] Biochem. Pharmacol. 26:1549-57. </p>
<p>Adverse health effects associated with exposure to dioxins and furans, such as found in pentachlorophenol, are well documented. 
Schwetz et al., The Effect of Purified and Commercial Grade Pentachlorophenol on Rat Embryonal and Fetal Development 
[1974], Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 28:151-61. Dioxins were considered carcinogens in rodents since the late 
1970's. Kociba, et al., Results of a Two Year Chronic Toxicity and Oncogenicity Study of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin 
in Rats [1978], Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 46:279-303; Van Miller et al., Increased Incidence of Neoplasms in 
Rats Exposed to Low Levels of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin [1977], Chemosphere 10:625; Muranyi-Kovacs, et al., 
Bioassay of 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid for Carcinogenicity in Mice [1976] British Journal of Cancer 33:626. </p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture has vigorously opposed the use of both pentachlorophenol for residential use and 
warned that this product &quot;should never be used inside . . . for any reason.&quot; U.S.D.A. Forest Service Forest Products 
Laboratory, General Technical Report FPL-11, Protecting Log Cabins from Decay [1977], p.2. </p>
<p>Numerous studies associate occupations in the lumber and sawmill industry with acute leukemias, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas and multiple myelomas. Milham, Study of Mortality Experience of AFL-CIO United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners of American, 1969-70 [1974], DHEW Pub. No. 74-129, Springfield, Virginia, National Technical Information Service; 
Jappinen, et al., Cancer Incidence of Workers in Finnish Sawmill [1989], Scand. J. Work Environ. Health 15:18-23; Morton 
and Marjanovic, Leukemia Incidences By Occupation in Portland-Vancouver Metropolitan Area [1984] Am. J. Ind. Med. 
6:185-205; Burkart, Leukemia in Hospital Patients with Occupational Exposure to Sawmill Industry[1982], West. J. Med.

or Chlorophenols [1979], Lancet i:56; Milham and Hessler, Hodgkin's Disease in Woodworkers [1967] Lancet ii: 136-37. </p>
<p>Exposures to chlorophenol herbicides in the lumber industry have been the principal cause of the increased risk of hematopoietic 
cancers. Erickson, ibid.; Hardell, ibid. </p>
<p>Hardell in a 1981 study of forestry workers exposed to chlorophenols found an eight-fold increase in soft tissue sarcomas and 
malignant lymphomas due to herbicides containing chlorophenols, primarily PCP. Hardell, et al., Malignant Lymphoma and 
Exposure to Chemicals, Especially Organic Solvents, Chlorophenols and Phenoxy Acids: A Case-Control Study [1981], British 
Journal of Cancer, 43:169-76. </p>
<p>The State Department of Health study, supra, of the reported cancers at Simpson's Arcata mill shows the latency period from 
exposure to this carcinogen, until the clinical detection of cancer, was fourteen to seventeen years. Accordingly, Skaggs exposure 
in 1971-73 to be consistent with his being diagnosed with leukemia in 1988. </p>
<p>Today pentachlorophenol is recognized as a carcinogen by the State of California. </p>
<p><a name="simpson"><strong>PENTACHLOROPHENOL USE AT SIMPSON LUMBER COMPANY</strong></a> </p>
<p>Fred Jacobson worked for Simpson Timber Company for 35 years. Between 1966 and 1980 he was Simpson Timber's Arcata 
Plant's buyer and purchasing agent and was responsible for purchasing all chemical products used in the Arcata plant. The 
Arcata plant used to have a paint line which included a curtain coater that was used to coat redwood siding with Woodlife Clear 
RTU. </p>
<p>According to Mr. Jacobson, the only product purchased for use at the Arcata plant was industrial Woodlife Clear RTU. This 
product was delivered to the Arcata Plant in 55 gallon drums for use in the paint line. Woodlife was used on the paint line at the 
Arcata plant until the paint line was shut down in 1972. </p>
<p>During the period 1970 through 1974 Mark Taifer was the chief executive responsible for the production of wood preservatives 
for U.S. Plywood-Champion. He testified that the company produced Woodlife from the period 1970 until 1974. </p>
<p>During the period 1966 to 1974 there were discussions concerning medical literature associating illness or disease with 
pentachlorophenol and Taifer was told there were questions concerning whether an impurity present in pentachlorophenol might 
be deemed dangerous to humans. The discussions were with Lester Winebrenner in Kalamazoo and possibly Jim Knauss. Lester 
Winebrenner and Jim Knauss were the most informed persons with Champion with regard to the hazards of Woodlife and 
pentachlorophenol that Taifer can remember. In his view the person most familiar with the toxic properties of pentachlorophenol 
during the period 1970-1976 was Lester Winebrenner. </p>
<p>James S. Knauss had been responsible for quality control and in 1970 assumed the duties of technical service manager for U.S. 
Plywood-Champion Papers. He testified that when Woodlife was used on redwood or red cedar it was more prone to bloom 
with these species of wood. Knauss tested blooming on many different shapes and formulations of wood and tested Woodlife on 
redwood and on bevelled siding. It was more prone to bloom on the rough side of siding when it occurred. Knauss confirms that 
allowing dust to get into the air which contains pentachlorophenol was a hazard. </p>
<p>Lester Winebrenner was the technical director responsible for all technical issues concerning Woodlife at Champion's main 
headquarters in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Mr. Winebrenner identified a letter from Jim Knauss to Lester Winebrenner of December 
19, 1967 in which Knauss stated: . &quot;It should be noted that we currently handle penta incorrectly. In addition, our customers 
handle the finished penta solution incorrectly.&quot; </p>
<p>In his own letter of January 8, 1968, Mr. Winebrenner wrote &quot;in some instances we know that our customers are a little careless 
in the handling of Woodlife and certainly suggest that they instruct their workers to apply good habits of personal hygiene, use 
neoprene-lined gloves, aprons, boots and other protective clothing.&quot; </p>
<p>Frank Foss a former sales representative for Champion International. He was the salesman who had the Simpson Timber 
account between June 1967 and September 1973. He personally took all of Simpson Timber's orders and was Simpson's main 
contact with Champion. </p>
<p>Foss visited Simpson Timber's Arcata plant approximately 23 times between June 1967 and September 1973, and one of his 
contacts at the Arcata plant was Fred Jacobson, Simpson's purchasing agent. </p>
<p>Foss also confirms that Woodlife Clear RTU was sold to Simpson Timber's Arcata plant and was used on the paint line, to coat 
redwood siding. </p>
<p>Foss had been told by Champion's technical department that redwood siding had the propensity to bloom after an application of 
Woodlife. Generally when blooming occurred it was a piece of wood that absorbed an inordinate amount of Woodlife, took a 
long time to dry and crystal sometimes would come to the surface. Foss was aware that when sanding or sawing wood that had 
been treated with pentachlorophenol the pentachlorophenol crystals might dispel into the air. </p>
<p>Throughout his employment with Champion Foss was never told at any time that there had been documented cases of 
pentachlorophenol poisoning, that pentachlorophenol poisoning can result from a massive dose or from a prolonged exposure to 
a sublethal dose. </p>
<p>At no time when Foss worked for Champion did he ever alert any of his customers that they should be alert for any specific 
medical conditions that their employees might have who work with Woodlife. </p>
<p>No one at Champion ever told Foss at any time to be alert for an acne condition that might be associated with individuals 
working in the application of Woodlife, and he was never told to be alert for any rash condition in such persons. Foss was never 
told at any time by anyone at Champion that he should inquire of customers with regard to any of the following symptoms in 
persons who work with Woodlife: rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, excessive perspiration, conjunctivitis or 
crusting of the eyes, depression or memory loss, insomnia or irritability, tingling or numbness in the extremities, blood in the urine 
or stool, burning sensation in the trachea or bronchi, nose bleeds, asthma-like symptoms, altered liver function, kidney or bladder 
infection or complaints, immune complaints, ongoing infections, children born with abnormalities, low sperm count, soft tissue 
sarcomas, unexplained fevers or night sweats, herpes sores or any skin disturbances below the eyes, at the temples or at the 
back of the neck or ears. Foss was never told of the possibility of the skin absorbing pentachlorophenol as a result of handling of 
non-pressure treated wood that had received pentachlorophenol or Woodlife. </p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Winebrenner, Mr. Foss has no understanding whether or not leather or rubber gloves were appropriate protection 
for handling Woodlife products. Mr. Foss testified, &quot;I don't know about the safety because I'm not a medical doctor.&quot; He never 
recommended that respiratory gear should be used by employees who were working in applying Woodlife. </p>
<p>Foss was not aware at any time during his work in sales in the 11 western states that Champion executives had written memos to 
each other in which they stated &quot;it should be noted that we currently handle penta incorrectly. In addition our customers handle 
the finished penta solution incorrectly&quot; and &quot;unfortunately, as you are no doubt aware, we had badly used pentachlorophenol 
over the years and do not take the normal precautions for a product of this toxicity.&quot; </p>
<p>On September 5, 1991, the day of his deposition, Mr. Stafford was employed by Simpson Timber Company as a Senior 
Planning and Control Analyst and Project Manager. He confirms that beginning in 1966 until the Arcata plant closed, Fred 
Jacobson was the Purchasing Agent or Purchasing Manager in charge of ordering raw materials for the Arcata plant. Stafford 
explained that the paint line used a curtain coater to apply a repellent to the back of each piece and to put a second coat of paint 
on the face of the board. Altogether there were three curtain coaters, an airless sprayer, and infra-red drying ovens that were all 
part of the process. Stafford believes the paint line shut down in 1973. Stafford had no prior knowledge that Don Laughman, 
Section Chief, Coatings Research at Simpson Timber, had written Lester Winebrenner on March 21, 1962, reporting that 
Simpson was &quot;curtain coating Woodlife on both faces of redwood siding, which we sell as water repellant treated siding&quot; and that 
&quot;Woodlife to which the E.H.E.C. had not been added sometimes curtains and sometimes does not.&quot; According to Stafford the 
person who would know more precisely than Stafford what kind of solvents were used on the paint line would be the operator at 
the time, Harry Kirby and Fred Jacobson, the Purchasing Manager. Harry Kirby knew the difference between Woodlife and 
other items in use on the paint line because the nature of his job required that he knew each product that was used, its purpose, 
its handling, its mixing, and what it took to clean it up. </p>
<p>Mr. Kirby from March 1962 to March 1984 worked continuously in the Arcata mill of Simpson Timber Company. He worked 
on the paint line continuously between 1962 and whenever the paint line shut down in 1972. In 1963 he was a helper on the 
paint line. After two years as a helper he became the operator. Mr. Kirby recalls brushing Woodlife when he was the operator 
during the period from 1968 through the shutdown. Mr. Kirby recalls using Woodlife on the paint line for clear siding, 
occasionally as back prime for white paint, and that a brush was used to coat the ends with Woodlife. In addition, it was sprayed 
in the booth. </p>
<p>During the two (2) months Lloyd Taylor worked on the paint line in 1967, he recalls a curtain-coater was used to apply 
Woodlife. </p>
<p>Tim Skaggs testified at his deposition that he began work at Simpson on March 8, 1971. He started on the night shift as a 
laborer and would be assigned to work where he was needed. An hour lunch break would take place between 9:00 and 10 
o'clock and Skaggs would eat where he was working that shift, in the dry sorter shack, the planing mill, or on the paint line. </p>
<p>Tim described the paint line as having curtain coaters which would spray the lumber with paint or Woodlife, it included three 
dryers and two curtain coaters. One would do one side and flip the board over and then send it back to the other one. One of 
Skaggs' jobs on the paint line was to work where the lumber came off the paint line itself and he would stack it by hand. On the 
paint line he was handling lumber without gloves that was almost always dry but sometimes, when the sealant wouldn't permeate, 
&quot;it would be wetter.&quot; Very few people wore gloves on the paint line handling the warm treated wood, according to Skaggs. 
Another job he did in the paint line room was to trim lumber with a small trim saw located on the south wall. He also was 
assigned to work on the paper wrapper in the paint line room. The boards that were handled at the paper wrapping machine had 
been coated with a sealant. Of all the times Skaggs worked in the paint line room, half the time was spent on the trim saws, a 
quarter of the time was spent off loading at the paint line and a quarter of the time was spent on the paper wrapper. </p>
<p>Alan Glaseroff, M.D. testified at his deposition that Tim was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at Stanford University. 
He first learned from Dr. Neil Water that Dr. Water had three people who had some type of leukemia and all worked at the 
same place. It was at that time that Dr. Glaseroff contacted the State of California to explore a cancer cluster. </p>
<p>Dr. Glaseroff was aware of Woodlife prior to this case. It contains a chemical within it known as dioxin which is a &quot;big issue up 
here.&quot; There have been a number of dioxin concerns with dumping in the bay and two pump hill plants having to change their 
process of bleaching wood from a non-chlorine process to get rid of dioxin contamination. The statement that is generally 
attached to dioxin is that it is &quot;the most potent carcinogen known to man.&quot; In Dr. Glaseroff's opinion, Tim Skaggs' cancer was 
secondary to his workplace exposure to PCP (pentachlorophenol). </p>
<p>Dr. Frank Gardner is a Professor of Medicine, Division Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 
Galveston, Texas. He received an M.D. degree from Northwestern Medical School, interned at San Francisco Hospital, had 
served residencies at San Francisco Hospital and University of California Hospital, San Francisco. Dr. Gardner has served as an 
Assistant Professor of Medicine on the Faculty of the Harvard Medical School and from 1966-1975 was a Professor of 
Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. From 1975 through 1990 Dr. Gardner was a Professor of Medicine 
and Director of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. Dr. Gardner is certified in 
internal medicine, has received numerous honors and has published approximately 340 articles, chapters, monographs and other 
publications in his field. He is well respected by Champion's hematologist Dr. William Creger. </p>
<p>In Dr. Gardner's opinion pentachlorophenol exposure causes acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A study of the health effects of 
munition packing cases treated with pentachlorophenol handled in Madison County, Kentucky showed pentachlorophenol 
residues ranging from 16 parts per billion to 551 parts per billion and confirmed six cases of leukemia among former Army depot 
employees: five chronic lymphocytical leukemias and one chronic myelocytic leukemia. Two additional leukemia cases were 
identified from the community which might have a connection with the 1968 munition packing cases. One was an individual who 
emphasized his exposure to pentachlorophenol (PCP) by recalling the munition cases which he purchased from the Army depot 
during the time the 1968 wood was being sold and used to construct a tobacco curing shed. He spent large amounts of time in 
the shed until his 1977 diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. </p>
<p>Dr. Gardner reports that a study of of saw mill workers in southern Oregon reviewed hospital admissions in three counties where 
there was a three-fold increase in leukemia suggesting that chlorophenol could be a cause. He confirms that Dr. Hardell's 1981 
article in the British Journal of Cancer studying 105 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients exposed to chlorophenol and toxic 
acids shows an association between pentachlorophenol and tumors of the B Cell Lymphocytic line and non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas, as similarly occurred at the Arcata Mill. In summary, Hardell's investigation suggests that exposure to organic 
solvents, chlorophenols and/or phenoxy acids constitutes a risk factor for malignant lymphoma. In addition a case study from the 
Mayo Clinic in 1963 show an association between pentachlorophenol and leukemia. </p>
<p>Dr. Gardner was expected to testify at trial that pentachlorophenol is irritating to the bone marrow causing mutagenic or 
chromosome abnormalities that are stabilized for a period of months or years and then the disease is activated by mechanisms 
unknown to us to develop into an acute malignancy. </p>
<p>People that are trimming wood that has been treated with chlorophenol have a higher level exposure than those that had been 
involved in packaging. In Mr. Skaggs' case the exposure routes for pentachlorophenol were both dermal and by inhalation. With 
regard to pentachlorophenol absorbed through the skin the temperature of the wood is significant because a warm agent will 
allow better evaporation because there would be more vapor. </p>
<p>In Dr. Gardner's professional opinion, to a reasonable medical certainty, pentachlorophenol can cause acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia. Tim Skaggs' exposure to pentachlorophenol was the probable cause of his acute leukemia. </p>
<p>Dr. Richard Clapp holds a doctorate in epidemiology. He was expected to testify that there is substantial, reliable, and credible 
epidemiologic evidence for the proposition that pentachlorophenol causes leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. </p>
<p>In Dr. Clapp's opinion, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, exposure to pentachlorophenol was the most likely cause of 
Timothy Skaggs' leukemia. The International Association for Research on Cancer has determined that pentachlorophenol has the 
capacity to induce cancer. The State of California lists pentachlorophenol as a cancer-causing substance under Proposition 65. 
The Finnish epidemiologic study, &quot;Cancer Incidence of Workers in Finnish Sawmill,&quot; is confirmatory evidence that exposure to 
penta-chlorophenols can more than double the risk of developing leukemia. The appearance of four blood/lymph cancers at Mr. 
Skaggs' sawmill was sixteen times the expected rate of leukemia given the size of the workforce at the sawmill. </p>
<p><a name="liability"><strong>CHAMPION'S LEGAL LIABILITY</strong></a> </p>
<p>In the Skaggs case the plaintiffs claimed that Defendant Champion International was negligent in the production, retailing and 
distribution of Woodlife Clear RTU contaminated with dioxins and furans, was strictly liable for producing and distributing a 
defective chemical product and additionally liable for breaching an implied warranty that Woodlife with pentachlorophenal was of 
good and merchantable quality, safe and fit for its intended use. It was also claimed that the Defendants knew this product was 
hazardous, misrepresented that it was safe to use and concealed from Simpson that many people inadvertently and routinely 
handled it in a dangerous manner. </p>
<p><a name="damages"><strong>DAMAGES</strong></a> </p>
<p>This case combined a survival action [the original personal injury action filed by Tim Skaggs prior to his death ] and a wrongful 
death action under California law brought by his family. CCP&#167;377.34 sets forth the measure of damages in a survival action 
which are essentially the same as those in a personal injury action except general damages for pain and suffering cannot be 
recovered. In addition to monetary loses, the measure of damages for wrongful death under California law is defined as 
&quot;reasonable compensation for the loss, love, care, comfort and society&quot; to be determined by a jury based upon all the facts and 
circumstances of the case. </p>
<p>Tim Skaggs died at age 41 and prior to his illness he was earning $28,800.00 per year. According to U.S. government Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, the average work-life expectancy in the lumber industry is to age 57. </p>
<p>The Skaggs case settled before Judge Michael Brown, following the denial of Champion's motion for summary judgment and 
after the completion of expert depositions before the scheduled trial. While denying liability, the Defendant paid $550,000 in 
settlement of all claims, a substantial recovery in Humboldt County where the primary industries are logging and fishing and 
average income is in the lowest twenty percent of California counties. The complete legal file in Skaggs v. Champion International 
is archived with the Clerk of the Humboldt County Superior Court, No. DR 85488. </p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm also served as plaintiffs' counsel in three related dioxin/pentachlorophenol caused wrongful death cases 
involving Simpson employees who had worked at the Arcata plant. Settlements in those cases are confidential. Gordon v. U. S. 
Plywood- Champion Papers, Humboldt County Superior Court Action No. 92 DR 0135; Carper v. U. S. Plywood-Champion 
Papers, Humboldt County Superior Court No. 92 DR 0378; Freeman v. U.S. Plywood-Champion Papers, Humboldt County 
Superior Court No. 93 DR 0275. </p>

<hr>


<p>A major break through in understanding the effect of dioxin exposure was published in December 1995 by Dieter Flesch-Janys 
and others, &quot;Exposure to Polychlorinated Dioxins and Furans (PCDD/F) and Mortality in a Cohort of Workers from 
Herbicide-producing Plant in Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany,&quot; 142 American Journal of Epidemiology 1165-1175 
(December 1, 1995).</p>
<p>The work of Dr. Flesch-Janys is significant in finding a dose-relationship between dioxin and cancer and heart disease mortality 
for workers of a pesticide manufacturing plant located in Hamburg, Germany that had produced phenoxy herbicides including 
2,4-D, chlorophenols, and other herbicides and insecticides known to be contaminated with dioxins and furans for a period of 
thirty-two years.</p>
<p>The major strength of this study is the availability of a quantitative exposure measurement, which allowed a direct estimate of 
dose-response relations for the 1189 studied workers. Actual dioxin exposure was based on measurements of blood dioxin 
levels in 190 workers.</p>
<p>The study is comprehensive and includes all plant workers who were employed for longer than three months from 1952 until the 
plant was shut down in 1984. The workers then were followed medically through the end of 1992.</p>
<p>A control group was utilized which consisted of 2528 workers at a gas supply company located nearby who were not exposed 
to dioxins in their employment. This control group and the availability of actual blood dioxin levels results in this study being the 
most conclusive and reliable of any recent research on dioxin.</p>
<p>The study found an increase in all deaths, cancer deaths, and deaths due to heart disease, when compared to the control group. 
The increased deaths due to heart disease is new information.</p>
<p>Following the explosion of a pentachlorophenol-pesticide plant operated by Hoffman-LaRoche in Seveso, Italy in 1976, 
increased deaths due to heart attacks were acknowledged,but speculatively attributed to post-explosion stress. This study 
supports the conclusion that those deaths were most probably due to dioxin exposure.</p>
<p>More significant is the finding that disease-related deaths increased with increased dioxin exposure.</p>
<p>Employees with the highest dioxin exposures were three times more likely to die from cancer, and nearly three times as likely to 
die from ischemic heart disease [narrowing of arteries leading to heart attack], compared to the control group, thereby confirming 
a dose-response relationship.</p>
<p>Smoking was ruled out as a confounding factor in this study because both the studied workers and the control group had the 
same proportion of smokers. But exposure of the plant workers to other cancer-causing chemicals could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>The finding of cancer deaths in dioxin-exposed workers is not a new finding.</p>
<p>Three previous studies have reported that cancer increases death among dioxin-exposed workers. A. Zober, et al, &quot;Thirty-Four 
Year Mortality Follow-up of BASF Employees Exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin After the 1953 Accident,&quot; 62 
International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health 139-157 (1990); Marilyn Fingerhut, W.E. Halperin, et al, 
&quot;Cancer Mortality in Workers Exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin,&quot; 199 New England Journal of Medicine 
212-218 (1991); A. Manz, J. Berger, et al, &quot;Cancer Mortality Among Workers in a Chemical Plant Contaminated with Dioxin,&quot; 
338 The Lancet 959-964 (1991).</p>
<p>This new study is unique because it is based on actual blood dioxin levels, as opposed to previous studies which estimated dioxin 
exposures. With hard blood dioxin data available for this cohort, a dose-response relationship could be investigated and was 
clearly demonstrated. For this reason this study will be given much greater weight than previous research.</p>

<h2>Industry's &quot;True Lies&quot;</h2>
<h3>The Politics Behind the Scientific Debate on Dioxin</h3>
<h4>By Stephen U. Lester</h4>
<hr>
<p><font size=2>Stephen Lester is the Science Director of </font><a href="http://www.essential.org/orgs/CCHW/CCHW.html"><font size=2>Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste</font></a><font size=2>. The Consumer Law Page is proud to republished this 
exceptional article which is reprinted with permission from the Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. This article originally appeared in 
Everyone's Backyard (v. 13, n.3), CCHW's quarterly journal of the grassroots movement for environmental justice.</font> </p>
<hr>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he full story of dioxin is a complex one, and includes coverups, lies, and deceit; data manipulation by corporations and 
government; and fraudulent claims and faked studies. For the public, it is a story of pain, suffering, anger, betrayal, and rage; of 
birth defects, cancer and many uncertainties about health problems. </p>
<p>Although many companies have contributed to the dioxin story, three chemical companies have played particularly significant 
roles: Monsanto, BASF, and Dow Chemical. All three manufactured commercial products that were contaminated with dioxin. 
All three conducted health studies to evaluate dioxin toxicity, which were then used for many years to support claims that there 
were no long-term effects, including cancer, from dioxin exposure. </p>
<h3>The &quot;Classic&quot; Dioxin Studies</h3>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1949, an explosion at the Monsanto chemical plant in Nitro, West Virginia, exposed many workers to the 
dioxin-contaminated herbicide 2,4,5-T. Thirty years later, Monsanto scientists and an independent researcher, Dr. Raymond 
Suskind, compared death rates among workers they said had been exposed to the death rates of workers who were not 
exposed. When no differences between the two groups were found, Monsanto claimed that dioxin did not cause cancer and that 
there were no long-term effects from dioxin exposure (Zack and Suskind, 1980). Monsanto released additional studies from 
1980 to 1984 supporting this general conclusion that there was no evidence of adverse health effects, other than chloracne, in 
workers exposed in the 1949 accident. </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>imilarly, a chemical accident in 1953 at a BASF trichlorophenol plant in Germany released dioxin-contaminated chemicals, 
exposing workers and the nearby communities of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen. Again, scientists working for the company 
looked at cancer rates nearly thirty years later and reported no differences between workers who were exposed and workers 
who were not exposed during the accident. Both the BASF and the first Monsanto study were released in 1980, shortly after 
researchers at Dow Chemical Company found that very low levels of dioxin caused cancer in rats. BASF and Monsanto results 
to challenge EPA efforts to regulate dioxin as a probable human carcinogen, arguing that humans respond differently to dioxin 
than do laboratory animals. People must be less sensitive, they argued. Otherwise, some evidence of cancer would have been 
found in the two &quot;classic&quot; studies. But when both the Monsanto and BASF studies were re-examined, the methodology used in 
both was found to have serious scientific flaws. </p>
<h3>Monsanto</h3>
<p><font size=5>E</font>vidence of inaccuracies in both the Monsanto and BASF studies was first revealed during the Kemner vs. Monsanto trial, in 
which a group of citizens in Sturgeon, Missouri, sued Monsanto for alleged injuries suffered during a chemical spill caused by a 
train derailment in 1979. While reviewing documents obtained from Monsanto during discovery, lawyers for the victims noticed 
that in one of the Monsanto studies, certain people were classified as dioxin exposed, while in a later study, the same people 
were classified as not exposed (Hay, 1992). </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>hese documents revealed that Monsanto scientists omitted five deaths from the dioxin-exposed an put them in the unexposed 
group. This resulted in a decrease in the observed death rate for the dioxin-exposed group, and an increase in the observed 
death rate for the non-exposed group. Based on this misclassification of dat, the researchers concluded that there was no relation 
between dioxin exposure and cancer in humans (Kemner, 1989). </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n truth, the death rate in the dioxin exposed group of Nitro workers was 65% higher than expected, with death rated from 
certain diseased (such as lung, genitourinary, bladder, and lymphatic cancers, and heart disease) showing large increases 
(Kemner, 1989). </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>nother Suskind study did not look at an original group of workers known to be dioxin-exposed, but instead looked at 
hundreds of Monsanto workers at the Nitro facility. Some of the same classification sleight-of-hand was performed in this study. 
Again, documents uncovered in Kemner vs. Monsanto showed that in fact there were 28 cancer cases in the exposed-worker 
group and only two in the unexposed group. Suskind, however, reported finding only 14 cancers in the exposed-workers group, 
compared to six in the unexposed group. </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>uskind also examined a group of 37 exposed Monsanto workers during the four-year period following the 1949 accident. 
Medical documents obtained by Greenpeace from the Sloan-Kettering Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Suskind worked, 
showed that workers suffered &quot;aches, pain, fatigue, nervousness, loss of libido, irritability, and other symptoms, active skin 
lesions, and definite patterns of psychological disorders.&quot; All but one of the 37 workers had developed chloracne, a sever skin 
condition. But in a report to Monsanto at the time, Suskind concluded, without further explanation, that &quot;his finding were limited 
to the skin;&quot; in other words, all other health effects of dioxin exposure besides chloracne, were not reported (Greenpeace, 
1994). Out of these studies grew the industry claim that chloracne is the only long-term effect of dioxin exposure. </p>
<h3>BASF</h3>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he study of BASF workers exposed to dioxin in 1953 was also found to have serious scientific flaws. BASF workers weren't 
convinced by company scientists' claim that there was no evidence of any health problems, other than chloracne, linked to dioxin 
exposure. They hired their own independent scientists to review the data. This review found that some workers who had 
developed chloracne, known to occur only in people exposed to high levels of dioxin, were included in the low or unexposed 
groups in the study. In addition, the exposed group had been &quot;diluted&quot; with 20 supervisory employees who appeared to be 
unexposed. When these 20 people were removed from the exposed group, significant increases in cancer were found among the 
exposed workers (Wanchinski, 1989; Rohleder, 1989). </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n February 1990, Dr. Cate Jenkins, project manager for the EPA Waste Characterization and Assessment Division of the 
Office of Solid Waste, alerted EPA's Science Advisory Board about the revelations of fraud in the BASF and Monsanto studies. 
The Board, which is an independent group of scientists from outside the agency, had recently completed a review of the cancer 
data on dioxin, which included the BASF and Monsanto studies and concluded that there was &quot;conflicting&quot; evidence about 
wheter dioxin caused cancer in humans. The Board recommended that EPA continue to rely on data from animal studies 
(Jenkins, 1990). </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>his animal study data however, had been under attack since mid-1987 when, under pressure from industry, EPA stated that 
they may have &quot;overestimated&quot; the risks of dioxin. The agency was then preparing to weaken their risk estimate from dioxin 
(Inside EPA, 1987), based largely on the exposure effects reported in the Monsanto and BASF studies. </p>
<p><font size=5>J</font>enkins asked EPA to re-evaluate the proposed regulatory changes and to conduct a scientific audit of Monsanto's dioxin 
studies. Instead, in August 1990, the EPA Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) recommended a &quot;full field criminal investigation 
be initiated by OCI.&quot; After two years, OCI abandoned the investigation because some of the alleged criminal activities were 
&quot;beyond the statue of limitation.&quot; In fact, EPA actually spent two years investigating Cate Jenkins (Sanjour, 1994). </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>ubsequent studies on the exposed workers at both the Monsanto plant and the BASF plant have been published in scientific 
journals. In 1991, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) re-examined the causes of death in 
workers at the Nitro plant and found increases in all cancers (Fingerhut, 1991). Similarly, in 1989, data on the BASF workers 
was re-examined and an increase in all cancers was found for workers with chloracne and with 20 or more years since exposure 
(Zober, 1990). The re-examination of these once &quot;classic&quot; studies provides strong evidence that the workers exposed to 
dioxin-contaminated chemicals in these two accidents did indeed suffer higher rates of cancer. </p>
<h3>The Dow Chemical Company</h3>
<p><font size=5>D</font>ow Chemical Company produced the herbicides 2,4,5-T and Agent Orange, the defoliant that was sprayed on the jungles of 
Vietnam. Both herbicides are contaminated with dioxin during the manufacturing process. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1965, Dow conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the toxicity of dioxin on inmates at Holmesburg prison in 
Pennsylvania. Under the direction of Dow researchers, pure dioxin was applied to the skin of prisoners. According to Dow, 
these men developed chloracne but no other health problems. But no health records are available to confirm these findings, and 
no follow-up was done on the prisoners, even after several went to the EPA after they were released seeking help because they 
were sick. EPA did not help them (Casten, 1995). </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n 1976, Dow began studies to evaluate whether animals exposed to dioxin would develop cancer. Dow chose very low 
exposure levels, perhaps anticipating that the studies would show no toxic effects at low levels. Much to their surprise, they found 
cancer at very low levels, the lowest being 210 parts per trillion (Kociba, 1978). </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>round the same time, evidence was found of increased miscarriages in areas of the Pacific Northwest that were sprayed with 
the herbicide 2,4,5-T (USEPA, 1979). Based on these findings, the EPA proposed a ban on the herbicide (Smith, 1979). Dow 
brought their scientists to Washington and created enough pressure that by 1979 EPA had decided to only &quot;suspend' most used 
of 2,4,5-T. This enabled Dow to continue to produce this poison until 1983, when all uses of the herbicide were finally banned. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n mid-1978, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources found dioxin in fish in the Tittabawassee and Saginaw rivers. Dow 
discharged wastewater into these rivers from its plant in Midland. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>ow responded in a most unusual way. In November 1978, after an intense four and one half month effort that cost the 
company $1,8 million, Dow released a report called the &quot;Trace Chemistries of Fire,&quot; (Rawls, 1979) which introduced the idea 
that dioxin was present everywhere and that its source was combustion and any and all forms burning (Dow, 1978). Dow 
released the report at a press conference rather than in the scientific literature, which is the standard procedure with scientific 
studies. The report concluded that dioxin in the Tittabawassee and Saginaw rivers came not from Dow, but from &quot;normal 
combustion processes that occur everywhere.&quot; A Dow scientist stated at the time that, &quot;We now think dioxin have been with us 
since the advent of fire&quot; (Rawls, 1979). </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>ubsequent studies have proven the &quot;combustion theory&quot; claims to be more public relations myth than scientific fact. 
Measurements of dioxin in lake sediments show that dioxin levels dramatically increased after 1940, (Czuczwa, 1984, 1985, 
1986) when chemical companies such as Dow began to make products contaminated with dioxin. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>ther studies reveal that prehistoric humans, who burned wood for fuel, did not have significant quantities of dioxin in their 
bodies. Tissues from 2,000-year-old Chilean Indian mummies did not have dioxin (Ligon, 1989). EPA states in its reassessment 
that dioxin can be formed through natural combustion sources, but this contribution to levels in the environment &quot;probably is 
insignificant&quot; (USEPA, 1994a). </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>espite the persistent efforts of industry to detoxify dioxin, the weight of evidence from scientific literature today confirms its 
pervasive toxic effects. Faced with the toxic truth about the dioxin they create, industry has two choices: either stop producing 
dioxin, or continue to deliberately poison the public policy debate with lies and conflicting information. History tells us they will 
continue the lies until we make them own up to the truth. </p>

<p><font size=5>M</font>any authors have contacted The Consumer Law Page seeking inclusion on this site. This book so impressed us that we wrote 
this review. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n two words: thank goodness. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>his book is a long overdue source of essential information on common household pesticides by a highly respected medical 
doctor and scientist well versed in environmental and occupational medicine. It is a powerhouse of information on diseases, 
adverse health effects and potential injuries caused by household pesticides. </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>ritten by one of the nation's foremost authorities on pesticides, Dr. Marion Moses, Designer Poisons' major focus is on 
chronic effects: the seemingly small, and apparently minor, exposures which occur on a regular basis over a long period of time 
but which tragically result in cancer, reproductive disorders, and damage to the brain and nervous system. The culprits? A broad 
range of commonly available chemicals that are readily found at home and used day in and day out by the unsuspecting. Although 
acute health effects are also clearly described by the author, the major value of this book is that it addresses the devastating 
effect of chronic exposures. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he U.S. chemical industry prefers to ignore chronic effects and EPA and NIOSH mandated Material Safety Data Sheets are 
seriously deficient because they are limited to describing the symptoms of acute exposures, when for most workers it is the 
repetitive, long-term exposure that is the cause of devastating injuries and death. Moses is to be applauded for forthrightly 
addressing the chronic exposure issues in this new book. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he book is packed with unique, detailed tables listing potential chronic effects for the active ingredients in hundreds of brand 
name products sold over-the-counter and used by professional exterminators in the home, on humans, pets, and lawns. It also 
cross indexes chemical names with trade and generic names. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>esigner Poisons is a valuable and authoritative source of essential information on the health aspects of pesticides. This book is 
an invaluable reference for assessing potential pesticide-related illnesses and evaluating the responsibility of manufacturers for 
resulting injuries. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>his book is strongly recommended for physicians, toxicologists, occupational medicine clinics, public health officials, health and 
safety regulation administrators, attorneys and anyone interested in the diagnosis, etiology and prevention of chronic chemical 
exposure injuries and illnesses. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
<p>Congenital microcephaly, abnormally small head circumference, is caused by environmental or genetic factors. </p>
<p>Genetic causes of microcephaly do their damage through Mendelian patterns of inheritance of a defective or damaged gene or 
chromosome. Many cases of microcephaly are denominated &quot;idiopathic&quot; because the likely causal factor(s) are not known. 
Nonetheless the vast majority of the idiopathic cases of microcephaly are not genetic, but rather are environmental. </p>
<p>Environmental causes of microcephaly are the result of deleterious exposures which occur during pregnancy and which interfere 
with normal proliferation and migration of neural cellsthe fundamental building blocks of the central nervous system. 
Environmental factors commonly associated with microcephaly include: ethanol ingestion; inhalation of mixed solvent vapor [as in 
glue or paint sniffing]; certain pharmaceutical drugs; maternal infection, e.g. rubella; and radiation. Certain chemicals, such as 
methyl ethyl ketone [MEK], have the capacity to produce microcephaly because they target the developing fetal brain and 
interfere with proper, timely, and adequate proliferation and migration of the neural cells. </p>
<p><b>Properties of MEK</b> </p>
<p>MEK is a colorless, volatile, organic solvent with a pleasant pungent odor akin to lacquer thinner. It is commonly used as a 
cleaning solvent in industry.. </p>
<p>Chronic inhalation of MEK vapors at concentrations in the range of 100-300 PPM and higher is toxic to the adult central 
nervous system. Headache, dizziness, and mental confusion are common early signs of MEK's neurotoxic potential. MEK also 
has the peculiar property of potentiating the neurotoxicity of other organic solvents. </p>
<p>MEK's remarkable ability to enter the body through intact human skin has been known for years. For example,because the 
threshold limit value [TLV] for workplace exposure to concentrations in air of MEK does not take into account skin contact as a 
common route of exposure, one must question the reliability of the TLV concept as offering adequate protection even for adult 
workers. </p>
<p>Animal developmental toxicology studies on MEK in peerreviewed literature show it is fetotoxic; it has the capacity to interfere 
with normal fetal growth and development. </p>
<p>There are several ways that chemicals can cause harm to a fetus. This entire spectrum of harm is often referred to as 
developmental toxicity, and it comprises not only externally visible structural malformations but also fetotoxicity an endpoint often 
measured in terms of intra uterine growth retardation. </p>
<p>Thalidomide is the most famous example of how ingesting a toxin just once at a critical time in pregnancy can produce structural 
malformations [&quot;dysmorphologic&quot; effects] such as foreshortened limbs. </p>
<p>But chemicals which interfere with the normal growth and development of the fetus throughout gestation can actually cause much 
more devastating and irreparable harm, especially if the affected system is the developing central nervous system. </p>
<p>MEK's fetotoxic ability is dosedependent, with the nature and extent of fetal harm increasing as the daily dose and the duration of 
exposure increases. The animal toxicology studies on MEK are all large, welldesigned studies and all demonstrate significant 
doserelated fetotoxicity, namely intrauterine growth retardation. </p>
<p>A 1974 study by Schwetz et al, Embryo and Fetotoxicity of Inhaled Carbon Tetrachloride, 1,1Dychlorethane and Methyl Ethyl 
Ketone in Rats, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 28:452 (1974) [for Dow Chemical] reports significant fetotoxicity in rats 
at several doses and a significant incidence of structural malformations [imperforate anus and &quot;bird jaw&quot;] in the most 
heavilyexposed rats. </p>
<p>A followup rat study jointly commissioned by MEK manufacturers in 1978 and delivered to one manufacturer in 1979 also had 
strong positive findings of intrauterine growth retardation and other signs of fetotoxicity. Deacon et al, EmbryoFetoxicity of 
Inhaled Methyl Ethyl Ketone in Rats, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 59:620 (1981). </p>
<p>In 1991 a mouse study found significant fetotoxic effects in MEKexposed offspring examined immediately after birth. Schwetz et 
al, Developmental Toxicity of Inhaled Methyl Ethyl Ketone in Swiss Mice, 16:742 (1991). </p>
<p>After reviewing these three developmental toxicity studies and making appropriate inter and intraspecies extrapolations, the U.S. 
EPA set a &quot;reference dose&quot; of .3 PPM for human inhalation exposure to MEK. The dose of MEK absorbed into the 
bloodstream of a pregnant woman is approximately the dose delivered through the placenta to her fetus. As a result, if a pregnant 
woman is routinely breathing air containing significantly more than .3 PPM of MEK, her fetus will be receiving a fetotoxic dose of 
MEK. </p>
<p>Daily doses of MEK in common industrial settings, where MEK is used as a solvent without positive ventilation or protective 
equipment, result in air concentrations several hundred times greater than the socalled &quot;safe harbor&quot; reference dose. </p>
<p><b>MEK Targets the Fetal Brain </b></p>
<p>The rodent studies described above establish, beyond any doubt, that MEK induces intrauterine growth retardation and is thus a 
developmental toxicant. </p>
<p>These findings are confirmed by a 1990 European study reported in the peerreviewed literature in which rats were exposed to 
MEK during gestation and the postnatal period, when significant brain growth and development normally occurs in rodents. 
StoltenburgDidinger et al, Neurotoxicity of Organic Solvent Mixtures and Fetotoxicity, Neurotoxicology and Teratology, 12:585 
(1990). Examination of the MEKexposed brains showed significant retardation of growth and development of the cerebellar 
cortex. The implications of this finding are profound and compelling. Damage to the cortex interferes with intellectual functioning, 
reasoning, and judgment. </p>
<p><b>Defenses Raised by Manufacturers </b></p>
<p>Although exposure to organic solvents during pregnancy poses a very severe risk to the developing human fetus and had been a 
fundamental fact known to toxicologists for decades, in litigated cases of congenital brain damage caused by MEK, 
manufacturers argue that because there are no human epidemiologic studies or case reports which explicitly identify MEK, acting 
alone, as the cause of human developmental harm, it is &quot;junk science&quot; to attribute a given child's developmental harm to MEK. 
Such arguments weak for several reasons. </p>
<p>First, nobody has, or ever will, test MEK on pregnant women. The days of Mengele are over. It is immoral and unethical to 
knowingly expose pregnant women to a potential developmental toxicant to observe outcomes. In fact, a number of studies 
where volunteers were exposed to MEK for short periods explicitly excluded pregnant women from participation. </p>
<p>Second, and equally relevant, typically workplace exposures involve mixed solvents rather than a single agent. In contrast, 
medications are prescribed and taken during pregnancy on an individualistic and closely monitored basis. In the case of 
thalidomide, for example, there were realistic opportunities for alert clinicians to observe and report adverse developmental 
effects of drugs they prescribed to pregnant patients. </p>
<p>With workplace exposures to mixed solvents, on the other hand, because physicians and their patients are often unaware of the 
potential for harmful exposure, a reliable exposure history is not obtained and thus the potential role of a specific solvent 
exposure in any subsequent adverse outcome becomes virtually untraceable. </p>
<p>Given these significant threshold, frontend limitations to full documentation of workplace exposures, the numerous retrospective 
studies which do find associations between solvent exposure and adverse effects cannot possibly fill in the data gap in the way 
defendant insinuates it must be filled before there is &quot;proof&quot; that MEK has the ability to cause developmental toxicity in humans. </p>
<p>Reputable scientists concede that the scientific method involves considerations of the weight of evidence rather than some sort of 
&quot;litmus test&quot; for whether a given chemical can cause human developmental toxicity. </p>
<p>The evidence that MEK can cause human developmental toxicity, including microcephaly and mental retardation, does not stop 
with retrospective case control epidemiologic studies which link mixed industrial solvent exposure with central nervous system 
malformations and other fetal damage, either. A solid body of scientific literature confirms the biological foundation that MEK is a 
developmental toxin. </p>
<p>By the late 1970s two independent sources of human data were accumulating which pointed to organic solvents as a major 
factor in environmentallycaused microcephaly and mental retardation. </p>
<p>The first data concerned fetal alcohol syndrome [FAS]a devastating condition associated with maternal ingestion of ethanol 
during critical phases of fetal brain growth and development. FAS children are mentally retarded because their brain growth is 
slowed during gestation; ethyl alcohol and/or its metabolites disrupts orderly proliferation and migrational of neural cells, resulting 
in a small brain, a retarded intellect, and of course, microcephaly. </p>
<p>The second data focused on what has been dubbed &quot;fetal solvent syndrome.&quot; The first case report was published in 1979 and 
involved a woman who chronically inhaled solvents during pregnancy as a form of recreational stimulus. Her child was 
microcephalic and mentally retarded. Numerous case reports since have described mentally retarded, microcephalic children 
whose mothers sniffed the vapor from all manner of solventbased paints, glues, thinners, cements during pregnancy. While these 
unfortunate children are typically described as having &quot;toluene embryopathy&quot; it is more accurate to describe them as victims of 
&quot;fetal solvent syndrome&quot; for this reason: the chemical constituents in commercially available spray paints, glues, cements, 
adhesives and thinners are mixes of solvents and a significant constituent solvent in many of these mixtures is MEK. </p>
<p><b>Proving Chemically Induced Microcephaly </b></p>
<p>To determine the cause environmental or genetic of any case of microcephaly is an iterative process of systematically narrowing 
the possible explanations by ruling out as many potential causes as possible. </p>
<p>It is necessary to determine whether microcephaly is due to </p>
<ul>
<li>a recognized genetic condition, such as Fragile (X) syndrome </li>
<li>chromosomal anomalies </li>
<li>maternal infection, e.g. rubella </li>
<li>maternal exposure to radiation </li>
<li>maternal ingestion of medication </li>
<li>recreational &quot;sniffing&quot; of solventbased paint, glue and/or paint thinner </li>
<li>maternal ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy [&quot;fetal alcohol syndrome&quot;] or </li>
<li>toxic chemical exposure. </li>
</ul>
<p>The next question in the iterative process is: Of all the potential causes of microcephaly, genetic or environmental, how likely is 
any one of them in particular to have played a role? </p>
<p>In an actual litigated case of congential microcephaly there were several reasons for concluding that that the cause was unlikely to 
have been genetic, i.e., the result of a dominant or recessive trait passed on via the rules for Mendelian inheritance. First, the child 
not have any recognized genetic syndrome. Second, there was no family history and no consanguinity between his parents and 
thus no basis to suspect that a familial syndrome might be uncovered if one searched the family tree. Third, the patient had no 
physical features that suggest that his microcephaly was autosomal recessive in origin. </p>
<p><b>Idiopathic Often Means the Cause is Environmental </b></p>
<p>Although many cases of congenital microcephaly are labelled &quot;idiopathic&quot; because no apparent environmental or genetic cause 
can be convincingly identified, about four in five cases of isolated microcephaly fall into the idiopathic category. </p>
<p>It is commonly reported that of the universe of children with socalled &quot;idiopathic&quot; microcephaly, only 57% have younger siblings 
who are affected the sine qua non evidence that in these children the original microcephaly is of autosomal recessive origin rather 
than environmental. </p>
<p>Of the universe of children born with isolated microcephaly and mental retardation for whom no cause is apparent, a very small 
percentage are likely to turn out ultimately to be of true genetic origin. The inescapable inference is that the vast majority of 
socalled &quot;idiopathic&quot; cases are in fact the result of an environmental insult in the womb. Thus, any given case of &quot;idiopathic&quot; 
microcephaly is much more likely to be environmental than genetic. </p>
<p>The final question in the iterative process becomes: Can it be established to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that 
MEK was the specific environmental factor causing microcephaly? </p>
<p><b>MEK Can and Does Cause Microcephaly</b> </p>
<p>Once all other potential causes have been ruled out, environmental exposures are often the cause and if there is a chronic, in 
utero exposure to MEK, it is most probably the cause of microcephaly or mental retardation. </p>
<p>MEK is a fetotoxic chemical that induces developmental delay, including retarded brain development in humans and in utero 
exposure to MEK can readily cause microcephaly and mental retardation. The current scientific evidence is compelling. </p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Models for MEK's capacity to Induce Microcephaly: The evidence for MEK's developmental neurotoxicity is 
consistent and positive in four animal toxicology studies in peerreviewed literature, culminating with the dramatic evidence 
that MEK actually targets the developing central nervous system, producing abnormally small brains in exposed test 
animals. </li>
<li>IntraSpecies Differences: The weight of evidence is that the human species is at least as vulnerable as the rat or mouse to 
the effects of in utero MEK exposure. In fact, because humans are a higher life form, public health officials always assume 
that we are much more vulnerable to toxic exposures than rats, mice, guinea pigs or rabbits. </li>
<li>Maximum Safe Daily Dose During Pregnancy: The EPA's derivation from these animal data of a human Reference Dose 
of .3 PPM for MEK, i.e., the maximum daily dose of MEK a pregnant woman can absorb without risking fetal harm is far 
less than the amounts of airborne MEK to which industrial workers are commonly exposed. </li>
<li>Critical Time(s) in Fetal Brain Growth: In normal fetal development in humans, the most significant brain growth occurs in 
the second half of pregnancy. A child born with microcephaly and mental retardation has to have sustained a significant 
interference with brain growth over an extended period during pregnancywith the second half of pregnancy being most 
significant. </li>
<li>Human Evidence on Solvents and Fetal Brain Damage: The human epidemiologic data on mixed organic solvent exposure 
shows associations with adverse developmental outcomes, including microcephaly and mental retardation </li>
<li>Lessons from Alcohol Ingestion, &quot;Glue Sniffing&quot; etc.: The large body of peerreviewed literature on Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome, Fetal Solvent Syndrome, and on experimental chemical induction of microcephaly, elucidate the mechanisms 
by which microcephaly is actually produced. </li>
<li>Biologic Plausibility of the Association: The biological foundation for the existence of an association between in utero 
MEK exposure and damage to the developing fetal brain, is MEK's neurotoxic properties, its affinity for lipid rich tissue 
including the brain, its ready skin penetration, and its ability to cross the placenta, and the fetal liver's inability to detoxify it. </li>

<p>While the key to preparing and understanding a toxic tort case is working with a reputable toxicologist, once it is determined that 
a given chemical is in fact the cause of the victim's injury or death, the services of an expert in pharmacokinetics are required. 
Pharmacokinetics studies the way animals absorb, distribute, metabolize and eliminate a chemical. While the field of toxicology 
measures the effect of a chemical on an animal, pharmacokinetics attempts to measure the effect of the animal on the chemical. 
Originally designed to assist doctors in evaluating the therapeutic use of drugs in humans, pharmacokinetic studies measure the 
processes of absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of a chemical in the body. Because the body is a dynamic 
system in which the concentration of chemicals in various locations changes with time, pharmacokinetics is often the refuge of the 
defense where it can introduce multiple additional parameters and confounders to create misunderstanding in an effort to mislead 
the jury into believing that a given, proven toxic is no more dangerous than other known chemicals. Understanding the 
terminology of pharmacokinetics is helpful in proving and defending a toxic tort case. </p>
<p>The term <i>absorption</i> refers to how fast a chemical enters the body, and how much of it enters the body. The absorption of a 
chemical into the body varies depending on the route of administration. For instance, most chemicals penetrate through the skin 
into the body more slowly than they penetrate through the stomach or intestinal tract. For these chemicals the skin can act to limit 
the chemical's entry into the body. Other chemicals are readily absorbed by the skin which serves as a sponge, especially when 
the toxic solvent soaks clothing, gloves, or shoes, which serve as a continuously repeating application. Recent studies by 
dermatologists at the University of California confirm that skin absorption is a major route of entry. Chemicals absorbed in this 
fashion are usually undiluted and unchanged by the digestive process and readily lodge with lipid [fat] tissue. Dioxins and PCBs 
are readily found in fat samples. </p>
<p>An important concept is the distinction between exposure and dose. <i>Exposure</i> is the amount of chemical the body contacts 
externally. But all does not necessarily enter the body. <i>Dose</i> is the amount of chemical that actually penetrates into the body, and 
the <i>effective dose</i> ultimately determines toxicity. </p>
<p><i>Distribution </i>refers to the dynamic movement and temporary storage of a chemical within the body. Virtually every chemical has 
a defined target organ, of which the most common are the brain, heart, lungs liver, kidney, and colon. Different kinds of tissues 
and organs take up and release chemicals at different rates. Sometimes distribution may have an effect on elimination. All 
chemicals move in and out of various bodily tissues at varying rates. Some are dissipated within hours, while others, especially 
those that bind with lipid tissue, may accumulate and remain for years. </p>
<p>The process of <i>metabolism</i> is the conversion within the body of the original chemical (parent) to a different chemical 
(metabolite). While not all chemicals are metabolized in the body, metabolites are helpful in assessing toxicity. While some 
chemicals are not toxic in certain animals, the metabolites in humans are found to be extremely toxins. A common class of 
metabolites are <i>conjugates</i>, which are combinations of the parent compound and other naturally-occurring chemicals in the 
body. Conjugates can be excreted more rapidly than the parent chemical. </p>
<p><i>Elimination</i> refers to the process by which a chemical leaves the body, whether by perspiration, respiration, urine or feces. 
Metabolism and elimination are both ways the parent chemical can be discharged from the body. Most chemicals are eliminated 
or excreted from the body, but at greatly varying rates. </p>
<p>The rate is very important, because from the elimination rate, the <i>half-life</i> can be calculated. Half-life is the amount of time it 
takes to either eliminate or metabolize one-half of the amount of chemical dose to the body. For example, if the half-life for 
elimination of a chemical is one day, then one half of the dose will be eliminated during the first day. During the second day, one 
half of the amount remaining in the body (one-fourth of the original dose) will be eliminated. Therefore, after 2 days 75% would 
be eliminated; similarly, after 3 and 4 days, 87.5% and 93.75%, respectively, would be removed from the body. </p>
<p>Elimination or metabolic rates that are characterized by a half-life value are also called <i>first order</i> processes. First order 
processes are very common throughout nature, the law of radioactive decay being an example. Similarly, pesticide degradation 
often is expressed in half- lives. </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies also determine how much chemical is in the body when an animal is exposed repeatedly or continuously 
to a chemical, similar to a workplace exposure. Under these conditions, the amount in the body (the <i>body burden</i>) will increase 
for a certain period of time. But, when the rate at which the chemical is entering the body equals the rate at which it is being 
eliminated, the amount in the body will no longer increase and absorption is at a maximum or <i>saturation.</i> With repeated and 
continuous exposure, the chemical's body burden will level off at a constant value which is called the <i>steady state</i> level or body 
burden. The attainment of a steady state concentration of a chemical in the body upon repeated exposure is a consequence of the 
dynamic of the relationship between the body, the chemical and the fact that it is being eliminated. </p>
<p>The term <i>bioaccumulation</i> refers to the ratio between the amount of chemical in the body after a single dose, and the steady 
state amount in the body following repeated doses. Bioaccumulation factors vary and, even while bioaccumulation occurs, 
elimination also continues. </p>
<p>Most of the dynamic processes responsible for handling a chemical in the body are first order ones (i.e., they have a half-life). 
However, if the dose becomes too high the process will no longer be first order. High doses lead to <i>saturation</i>, and indicate that 
the capacity to metabolize or eliminate a chemical has been overwhelmed by high dose levels. At saturation levels or above, the 
internal concentrations of the chemical may no longer be proportional to the administered dose level, leading to higher body 
levels than would be predicted from data at lower, non-saturating doses. </p>
<p>Laboratory pharmacokinetic studies differ from a classic toxicology study. For example, a pharmacokinetic study is normally 
designed for small groups of three to six animals, and no control groups are needed. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies typically 
measure different parameters than the classic toxicology study. Tracing, identifying and quantifying minute amounts of a chemical 
(and its possible metabolites) passing through a human or animal require great skill and often involve very intricate scientific 
detective work, which defense experts may not choose to exercise. </p>
<p>Design considerations include the identification of end products expected to be produced, the synergistic reaction of the chemical 
with the environment, the proper length of the study, the correct dosing regimen, the appropriate parameters to be measured, and 
the desirability of radioactive labeling as an aid to tracing the test chemical. </p>
<p>Following completion of an acceptable protocol, and selection of healthy subjects, the test chemical is administered. Blood 
samples typically are taken at regular periods. All urine and feces are collected and analyzed. With humans, careful pre-study 
and post-study physical examinations are made by physicians. </p>
<p>In animal studies, when dosing and sample collection are complete, the animals are sacrificed. Typically, liver, kidney, lungs, 
heart, brain, muscle, fat, carcass and other tissues are removed and analyzed, to identify the parent compound and any 
metabolites formed. </p>
<p>All of the samples collected are analyzed in order to quantify the levels found in each sample. Chemical levels found in excretory 
products and tissue samples are then compared to the total dose administered. Efforts should be made to recover all the dose 
administered. Even the air passing through the animal cage should be collected and analyzed, and the cages are washed down 
with a solvent for analysis. </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies provide data useful in many ways. Clearly, pharmacokinetic data is valuable in gaining a better 
understanding of how an animal or human reacts to a chemical. For example, pharmacokinetic data are used to select proper 
dosages for therapeutic drugs. In addition, they can be utilized in assessing the hazards of chemical exposures. </p>
<p>Identification of chemical metabolites through pharmacokinetic studies is also important in making interspecies comparisons. If a 
chemical responds in a similar manner in several different species, then one species may be a good model for others. Identifying 
the existence of metabolites is also crucial in interpreting the results of environmental and human monitoring. </p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, pharmacokinetic data on the rate of elimination in humans, coupled with accurate 
analytical measurements and knowledge of the time of exposure, allows the calculation of the <i>dose</i> actually received by an 
exposed victim. </p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol (also known as PCP or penta) conclusively has been established as a carcinogen in laboratory studies. </p>
<p>Because there is a latency period of many years between exposure and diagnosis, health care providers, union representatives, 
workers' compensation attorneys and trial lawyer practitioners should inquire of anyone who is suffering from blood or lymph 
cancers who has worked in the forestry, lumber mill, window manufacturing, paint, and construction industries of possible 
occupational exposures to penta and, in addition, whether they have lived in direct contact with treated wood, such as found in 
log cabins. </p>
<p>Currently we represent employees of the Simpson Lumber Company who worked on the same planing unit at the Arcata 
remanufacturing, or finishing, mill during the 1970's and who have subsequently suffered acute leukemias and non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma. While our action against U.S. Plywood, Champion Papers, Roberts Consolidated Industries, Beecham Home 
Improvement Products, and DAP, Inc.is in its infancy and an article on this particular case is premature, our research shows that 
few California workers' compensation lawyers have experience in dealing with toxic torts and California's plaintiffs' bar, in 
general, has failed to organize on these issues and to develope the technical expertise to assist individual practitioners in 
identifying potential third party actions. This current situation has developed despite a strong social commitment to a safe 
environment, an extensive logging industry and the fact that forestry workers specifically have been identified in the literature as 
primary victims of PCP induced carcinomas, among other occupationally exposed workers. </p>
<p>Our research also shows that the application of PCP in log cabin homes in the Midwest has been the primary legal battleground 
concerning this carcinogen and only by chance did we located Midwest counsel with expertise in this aspect of PCP litigation. </p>
<p>It is for these reasons we now share our research on pentachlorophenol, and that of others, with the hope that we will generate a 
dialogue or network of informed professionals for the benefit of our clients and the general public. </p>
<p><strong>Pentachlorophenol </strong></p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol has been used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, in industry, agriculture and domestic applications, 
but it is primarily a wood preservative. PCP is an extremely dangerous carcinogen when it is used to preserve wood for inside 
applications <i>Environmental Health Criteria 71, Pentachlorophenol</i>, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1987, pp. 11-12. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol has been used for years to preserve telephone poles, fence posts, and water exposed decking. In the 1970's 
it was introduced to preserve finished mill work, casements, mullions, and to treat perimeter wall logs in log home kits marketed 
to the public. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol is a halogenated hydrocarbon, composed of a benzene ring to which is attached a hydroxide radical making a 
phenol which is then chlorinated. Byproduct contaminants of the process include tetrachlorophenol, hexachlorobenzene and 
various dioxins and furans. Hexachlorodibenzodioxin, an extremely toxic dioxin, has appeared in commercially produced 
pentachlorophenol in the United States during the 1970s in amounts ranging up to 100 parts per million. A purer grade of 
commercial pentachlorophenol was developed, manufactured and sold by the Dow Chemical Company in response to concerns 
raised by the Environmental Protection Agency about the high level of dioxins in PCP which was being marketed in the early 
1970's. The newly developed product, Dowicide E. C. - 7, contained approximately 1% of the dioxin contamination found in the 
technical grade of pentachlorophenol used in the manufacture of Woodlife, a mineral spirit solution used by Simpson as a 
fungicide and originally marketed by U.S. Plywood. It subsequently was manufactured and sold by the successors to U.S. 
Plywood: Champion Papers, Roberts Consolidated Industries, Beecham Home Improvement Products, and DAP, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>Toxicity and Carcinogenicity</strong> </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol is a known toxic chemical. It is readily absorbed by lung, skin and stomach. While there may be difference in 
the biological response of rabbits and humans to 10% solution of pentachlorophenol, the probable oral and dermal lethal doses 
for a 150 pound person, based on the animal toxicity literature, is 1.09 ounces orally and 4.4 ounces dermally. </p>
<p>The body absorbs PCP and discharges it in a number of ways. While much of it is excreted in urine, it accumulates in tissues, 
particularly muscle, bone marrow, and fat. Braun, et al., <i>The Pharmokinetics and Metabolism of Pentachlorophenol in Rats</i> 
[1977], Toxical. Appl. Pharmacol. 41:395-406. </p>
<p>Pentachlorophenol is eliminated mainly through urine and the half life of elimination by urine has been observed to be as long as 
18 to 20 days. Uhl, et al.,<i> Pharmokinetics of Pentachlorophenol in Man </i>[1986], Arch. Toxicol. 58:182-186. </p>
<p>The &quot;no effect&quot; and &quot;lethal&quot; dose limits of pentachlorophenol are not greatly different. For example, at a dose of 80 milligrams per 
kilogram, no experimental animals died. At a dose of 100 milligrams 83% died and at 110 milligrams 100% died. Kehoe, et al., 
<i>Toxic Effects Upon Rabbits of Pentachlorophenol and Sodium Pentachlororphenate</i> [1959], J. INd. Hyg. Tox. 21: 160. </p>
<p>Chronic toxicity associated with PCP first was reported in <i>California Health</i> in June, 1970 in the case of a woman who moved 
into a newly constructed home which had been treated with PCP. She experienced rapid weight loss, weakening and tightening 
in her chest, and symptoms which were suspected to be asthma and bronchitis. After leaving the structure her health improved. </p>
<p>German literature reports health problems due to residential exposure to PCP. Brandt and Schmidt, in an article entitled 
<i>Chronische Lebererkrankung durch langjahrige Intoxikation im Haushalt mit Pentachlorophenol</i> [1977], Deutschen 
Gesellschaft fur innere Medizin, pp. 1609-11, reported fluctuating abnormal liver enzymes directly associated with moving into 
and out of a dwelling which had its interior treated with PCP. Later, Gebefugi reported health problems associated with 
residential interior exposure to pentachlorophenol. Gebefugi, et al., <i>Occurrence of Pentachlorophenol in Enclosed 
Environments</i> [1979] Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety 3:269- 300. </p>
<p>The health effects observed in both the occupational and residential exposures, especially those related to the skin and 
respiratory tract are best explained by laboratory findings involving immune system studies of laboratory animals. In a series of 
experiments reported in the early 1980's, Nancy Kirkvliet, et al., found that technical grade pentachlorophenol causes immune 
suppression in animals which she has linked to dioxins contained in pentachlorophenol and found that hepta and hexa dioxin are 
implicated. Kerkvliet, et al., <i>Humoral Immunotoxicity of Polychlorinated Diphenyl Ethers, Penoxypheols, Dioxins and 
Furans Present as Contaminants of Technical Grade Pentachlorophenol </i>[1985], Toxicology, 36:307-24 (see extensive 
articles cited). </p>
<p>In addition to suppressing the immune system, laboratory and epidemiological studies have shown technical grade PCP to be a 
carcinogen. Pentachlorophenol was a suspected carcinogen in 1978. Greene, et al., <i>Familial and Sporadic Hodgkin's Disease 
Associated with Occupational Wood Exposure</i>, The Lancet, September 16, 1978, pp. 626-27; Goldstein, et al., <i>Effects of 
Pentachlorophenol on Hepatic Drug/Metabolizing Enzymes and Porphyria Related to Contamination with Chlorinated 
Dibenzo-p- Dioxins and Dibenzo-Furans</i> [1977] Biochem. Pharmacol. 26:1549-57. </p>
<p>Technical grade pentachlorophenol contains dioxins. Dioxins have been considered carcinogens in humans since the early 1970s. 
Ton That Tung,<i> Le Cancer Prmaire Due Foie Au Viet-nam</i> [1973], 99:427-36; Hardell,<i> Soft-Tissue Sarcomas and 
Exposure to Phenoxy Acids: A Clinical Observation</i> [1977] Lakartidningen 74:2753-54. </p>
<p>Like technical grade PCP, phenoxy acids also contain dioxins as contaminants. Adverse health effects associated with exposure 
to dioxins and furans are well documented. Schwetz et al.,<i> The Effect of Purified and Commercial Grade 
Pentachlorophenol on Rat Embryonal and Fetal Development </i>[1974], Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 28:151-61. 
Dioxins were considered carcinogens in rodents since the late 1970's Kociba, et al., <i>Results of a Two Year Chronic Toxicity 
and Oncogenicity Study of 2,3,7,8- Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin in Rats</i> [1978], Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 
46:279-303; Van Miller et al., <i>Increased Incidence of Neoplasms in Rats Exposed to Low Levels of 
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin</i> [1977], Chemosphere 10:625; Muranyi-Kovacs, et al., <i>Bioassay of 2,4,5- 
Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid for Carcinogenicity in Mice </i>[1976] British Journal of Cancer 33:626. </p>
<p><strong>Government Response</strong> </p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Products Laboratory has vigorously opposed the use of both 
pentachlorophenol and creosote for residential use and warned these products &quot;<i>should never be used inside . . . for any 
reason.&quot; U.S.D.A. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory, General Technical Report FPL-11, Protecting Log 
Cabins from Decay </i>[1977], p.2. </p>
<p>Unfortunately vaporization of PCP cannot be inhibited by paint, varnish, or shellac when treated wood is used for an interior 
application and in log homes sealants are ineffective according to the EPA. Hosenfeld, et al., <i>Pentachlorophenol in Log 
Homes: A Study of Environmental and Clinical Aspects</i>, Environmental Protection Agency Contract Nos. 68-02- 3938 and 
68-02-4252 MRI Project Nos. 8201-A(11) and 8801 A(02) COEH Subcontract No. 117-7900-17 and 180-7900-9, pp. 
1-195, December 11, 1986. </p>
<p><strong>The Log Home Litigation Record</strong> </p>
<p>In <i>Perkins v. Northeastern Log Homes, Inc. Roberts Consolidated Industries and DAP, Inc</i>., U.S.D.C. Western District of 
Kentucky, Omaha attorneys Richard McMillin and Timothy Cuddigan, whose work significantly contributed to this article, are 
seeking recovery for PCP exposure occurring in 1978 when Mrs. Perkins used a solution of bleach to scrub PCP stains from the 
interior logs of her newly constructed log home. In 1986 Mrs. Perkins was diagnosed as suffering from non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, but did not discover the connection to PCP until 1989. This is McMillin's and Cuddigan's second log home case 
against Northesatern Homes having previously represented plaintiffs in <i>Johnson v. Northeastern Log Homes</i> in U.S.D.C. in 
Omaha, Nebraska in 1985. They report that Roberts Consolidated Industries had special reason to be aware of the adverse 
health effects in humans caused by residential interior exposure to pentachlorophenol because its PCP-based product, Woodlife, 
was involved in several cases in the 1970s. In <i>Fertig v. U.S. Plywood</i>, Polk County District Court, Des Moines, Iowa, plaintiffs 
claimed adverse health effects and property damage caused by the interior use of Woodlife containing PCP. The makers of 
Woodlife also were sued by the Tran King family in Idaho Falls, Idaho in 1976 for toxic exposure causing personal injuries and 
property damage. </p>
<p>According to their research, Northeastern Log Homes of Omaha had direct knowledge of the adverse health effects of Woodlife 
containing PCP that caused it in late 1978 to cease the use of Woodlife for dip-treating perimeter logs. Despite knowledge of 
these concerns Northeastern took no steps to affirmatively warn its customers about the hazards created by its use of Woodlife, 
even though in 1981 Dr. Vernon N. Houk, Acting Director for the Center for Environmental Health of the Center for Disease 
Control, specifically recommended that Northeastern inform its customers of possible health risks from PCP exposure in its log 
homes. </p>
<p><strong>Cancer in the Lumber Mill Industry</strong> </p>
<p>Numerous studies link occupations in the lumber and sawmill industry with acute leukemias, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas and multiple myelomas. Milham, <i>Study of Mortality Experience of AFL-CIO United Brotherhood of Carpenters 
and Joiners of American, 1969-70</i> [1974], DHEW Pub. No. 74-129, Springfield, Virginia, National Technical Information 
Service; Jappinen, et al.,<i> Cancer Incidence of Workers in Finnish Sawmill</i> [1989], Scand. J. Work Environ. Health 15:18-23;

<p>It is thought that exposures to chlorophenol herbicides in the lumber industry have been the principle cause for the increased risk 
of hematopoietic cancers. Erickson,<i> ibid.;</i> Hardell, <i>ibid</i>. These factors are strongly suspected as potentially causative in our

statistically expected malignancies. </p>
<p>Hardell in a 1981 study of forestry workers exposed to chlorophenols found an eight-fold increase in soft tissue sarcomas and 
malignant lymphomas due to herbicides containing chlorophenols, primarily PCP. Hardell, et al., <i>Malignant Lymphoma and 
Exposure to Chemicals, Especially Organic Solvents, Chlorophenols and Phenoxy Acids: A Case-Control Study</i> [1981],

<p><strong>Plan for Action</strong> </p>
<p>In Humboldt County a study by the State Department of Health of the reported cancers shows a latency period from exposure 
to a carcinogen, until the clinical detection of cancer, was fourteen to seventeen years. </p>
<p>The clear significance of this long latency period is that other cases can yet be expected and vigilant health care providers, union 
representatives, and lawyers must always suspect the potential for chemically induced leukemias and lymphomas in 
woodworking, lumber, and forestry workers. </p>
<p>With cancer taking a devastating social and economic toll, government funding for the placement of industrial hygienists in every 
significant cancer care center for the purpose of taking detailed histories of potential exposures should be a top health care 
priority in order to identify industrial practices and products for which further study and precautions are necessary. </p>

torts should please write Richard Alexander and Robert Bohn, P. O. Box 1330, San Jose, CA 95109-1330. </p>

<h2>The Cancer War Needs An Informed Public:</h2>
<h3>Known Carcinogens To Be Avoided</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>

<hr>


<p>The World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C. reports that cancer mortality is increasing with little explanation of the cause. 
The first step in preventing cancer is public education on healthy living and idedntifying known carcinogens. The second step is 
empowering the courts and our tort system to hold accountable the manufacturers and distributors of known carcinogens. The 
plaintiffs' bar knows that cancer prevention will become the watchword of American business when it is no longer profitable to 
sell foods contaminated with hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and preservatives and manfacture products that contain known 
carcinogens. </p>
<p>Some chemicals, while causing no observable immediate harm after days or months of exposure, will cause cancer years later. 
An informed person must read labels and know exactly what chemicals they are using at home and at work. </p>
<p>Unfortunately most manufacturers do not report the effects of low level, long-term exposures. The following chemicals, for 
example, should never be used without protective clothing and breathing protection, and to find out exactly how dangerous they 
are ask your local dump operator how to legally dispose of them. </p>
<p><strong>Benzene</strong> </p>
<p>Benzene causes leukemia. It is used as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is also found in paints, inks, adhesives, rubbers, glues, 
old spot removers, and furniture wax. Rubber workers exposed to benzene had a tenfold increase in leukemia. The National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends workers should not be exposed to 1 parts per ten million. Gasoline 
fumes have 1,000 times the concentration recommended by NIOSH. Never breathe gas fumes. </p>
<p><strong>Polyvinyl Chloride</strong> </p>
<p>Polyvinyl chloride, a plastic used in pipe, electrical wire and cable, home furnishings, toys, packaging, upholstery and auto parts, 
is made from vinyl chloride. It causes liver cancer, with a latency period is 15 to 40 years. Never inhale smoke from burning 
foam or plastic, such as in a car fire, and never dispose of these materials in a scrap fire or fireplace. </p>
<p><strong>Methylene Chloride</strong> </p>
<p>Methylene chloride is a popular solvent for resins, fats, and waxes and is used in paint, thinners, removers, adhesives, film, 
plastics, inks, foams, hairsprays, anti-perspirants, air fresheners, and printed circuit boards. Exposed workers have an increased 
incidence of pancreatic and liver cancer deaths. It produces malignant liver and lung neoplasms in animals. EPA considers it a 
probable human carcinogen. </p>
<p><strong>Trichloroethylene</strong> </p>
<p>Trichloroethylene (TCE) is used for degreasing metal parts. It is found in typewriter correction fluids, paint removers and 
strippers, adhesives, and spot removers. TCE in mice produces liver and lung tumors, kidney cancers, testicular tumors and 
leukemia in rats. Exposed workers have a high incidence of bladder cancer and lymphomas. It is probably a human carcinogen. </p>
<p><strong>Perchloroethylene</strong> </p>
<p>Tetrachloroethylene and perchloroethylene have been used in dry cleaning, degreasing metal, suede protectors, paint removers, 
water repellents, silicone lubricants, adhesives, spot removers, wood cleaners and many products used by hobbyists. In studies 
of rats and mice, liver and kidney cancers and leukemia have been produced at a sufficient level to cause EPA to classify it as an 
animal carcinogen and a probable human carcinogen. Old cans of spot remover contain this material. </p>
<p><strong>Polychlorinated Biphenyls</strong> </p>
<p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) include 209 related chemicals and are found in transformers manufactured before 1977, older 
welding equipment, x-ray machines, refrigerators and in fluorescent light fixtures. In laboratory tests PCBs cause liver, pituitary, 
and gastrointestinal tumors, as well as leukemia and lymphomas. EPA considers PCBs probable human carcinogens. </p>
<p><strong>Dioxins and Furans</strong> </p>
<p>Dioxins and furans are found in chlorinated organic solvents, pesticides, weed killers, wood preservatives, and charcoal starter. 
Although no longer manufactured in the U.S., they can still be found in the herbicide 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. EPA considers dioxin to 
be a &quot;cancer promoter&quot; and classifies it as a probable human carcinogen. Be safe and take the old cans of weed killer in the 
garage to your closest hazardous waste disposal facility. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately while manufacturers should test suspected carcinogens, they do not conduct necessary testing for many reasons 
and we will never learn what causes cancer unless we are willing to pay for the research. A better understanding of what 
chemicals promote cancer will occur when some of the peace dividend is devoted to research. </p>
<p>In an ideal world, every cancer care facility should have a full-time professional whose sole duty would be to document a 
patient's history of chemical exposure. Oncologists cannot be expected to undertake the long interviews to learn about past 
chemical exposures that have little to do with keeping their patient alive. On the other hand, industrial hygienists are specially 
trained to gather this type of information and pilot projects at major cancer care centers would be invaluable in expanding our 
understanding. </p>
<p>We do not have time to waste. Unless we begin gathering information on chemical exposures, our children's death rate from 
cancer will make ours look good by comparison. </p>

<h2>Proving Chemically Induced Asthma Symptoms:</h2>
<h3>Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome, A New Medical Development</h3>
<h3>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h3>
<hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.

<hr>


<p>Five years ago patients and clients who associated adult onset asthma with chemical exposure found they were unable to prove 
medical causation and were precluded from pursuing their right to recover for significant injuries caused by others. </p>
<p>This is no longer the case as a result of 1985 medical research by Brooks and others identifying a new illness which is virtually 
identical to asthma, can persist for years, and is caused by exposure to chemical irritants. </p>
<p>Understanding this medical development is important for both plaintiff personal injury attorneys, as well as workers compensation 
lawyers, because victims of chemical exposures who suffer asthmalike symptoms can now prove how they were injured by a 
chemical. </p>
<p><strong>Occupational Asthma </strong></p>
<p>For years medical researchers have documented asthmalike conditions in firefighters precipitated by smoke. Certain occupations 
have been known to be associated with asthmalike responses: polyurethane foam workers exposed to isocyanates, laboratory 
workers exposed to formaldehyde, meat wrappers working with polyvinyl chloride soft wrap film and heat activated price labels, 
electronic fabricators who solder, and metal refiners working with nickel, cobalt, and chromium. </p>
<p>While these illnesses were clearly associated with certain occupations, proximate causation in the third party setting faltered 
because of the inability of medical experts to distinguish work and non-work related asthma and the inability to prove that a 
chemical caused the condition. Today physicians can identify certain asthmalike conditions as being caused by chemical 
exposures. </p>
<p><strong>Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome </strong></p>
<p>This newly defined illness, known as RADS or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, is identical to asthma, but is induced by 
chemical exposure. Individuals with RADS have difficulty breathing, continuing cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. In all 
cases the condition occurs <i>after only one exposure</i> to a lung irritant and respiratory symptoms occur within twenty-four hours 
after exposure. Although many patients resolve within six months, some continue to be symptomatic for five years. </p>
<p>The criteria for confirming the diagnosis of RADS are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Documented absence of preceding respiratory complaints. </li>
<li>The onset of symptoms occurred after a single specific exposure incident or accident. </li>
<li>The exposure was to a gas, smoke, fume or vapor that was present in a high concentration and had irritant qualities. </li>
<li>The onset of symptoms occurred within twenty-four hours after the exposure and persisted for at least three months. </li>
<li>Symptoms simulated asthma, with cough, wheezing and dyspnea predominating. </li>
<li>Pulmonary function tests may show airflow obstruction. </li>
<li>Methacholine challenge testing was positive. </li>
<li>Other type of pulmonary diseases were ruled out. </li>
</ol>
<p>The major medical break through in making the RADS diagnosis is methacholine challenge testing, which confirms airway 
hyperresponsiveness. As a result, patients injured on-the-job or by third parties now have available a means of proof of injury, as 
the following important case study establishes. The diagnosis of RADS, while requiring correlation with the patient's clinical 
history can be supported by methacholine challenge testing and also through the use of peak expiratory flow rate measuring 
devices which can document a greater than 20% drop in peak flow over a twenty-four hour period and thereby confirm 
bronchospasm due to environmental and work place exposures. </p>
<p><strong>Important Case Study </strong></p>
<p>In 1991 Dr. David Kern reported an in-depth study of a 1988 spill of a gallon of acetic acid (100% vinegar) at a community 
hospital which exposed 56 members of the clinical staff. While other researchers have reported individual cases of RADS, 
&quot;missing from all these reports, however, are control groups, validation of reported preexposure health status, assessment of 
dose- response relationships, and consideration of chance occurrence and methodologic bias.&quot; </p>
<p>Kern's study addresses these issues and lays the cornerstone of the scientific foundation for the reactive airways dysfunction 
syndrome. </p>
<p>In the acetic acid spill, an increasing risk of RADS was found at high acetic acid exposure levels. Eight workers developed 
asthmalike symptoms within twenty-four hours of the spill and nearly a year later four still met all the criteria for RADS. While 
acknowledging that the numbers reported are small, Kern concludes that his research supports &quot;the presence of a dose-response 
relationship between acetic acid exposure intensity and persistent asthmalike symptoms with demonstrated airway 
hyperresponsiveness.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Plaintiffs Now Have Provable Claims </strong></p>
<p>As a result of this medical development, whole new categories of plaintiffs now have provable claims. </p>
<p>For example, hospital employees working in endoscopy units have recently been identified as suffering from RADS due to 
exposure to glutaraldehyde, widely considered one of the best disinfectants for cold sterilization. For years doctors and hospital 
administrators have considered glutaraldehyde to pose little risk and it is normally used in unprotected, open environments. 
However, British researchers for the past several years have reported that methacholine challenge testing confirms a definite 
association between glutaraldehyde exposure and respiratory symptoms. As a result, one manufacturer's disclosure on its 
Material Safety Data Sheet [that 2 per cent glutaraldehyde can be categorized as merely an inhalation irritant that can be safely 
used without ventilation] clearly fails to warn of the known dangerous propensities of this product. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>To lose the ability to enjoy clear breathing is a major, significant and life threatening injury. Thanks to recent developments 
medical science can now identify necessary precautions for using chemicals and products once thought to be safe. In addition, 
these developments now provide juries with the ability to legally hold accountable manufacturers and sellers who neglect to 
properly warn the public concerning their product's hazards. The criteria listed above for making the diagnosis of RADS is 
equally important to lawy ers representing victims of RADS as an important checklist for proving chemically induced injury and 
for ruling out asthma of unknown origin. Defendants will continue to claim that survivors of chemical exposure suffer from a 
pre-existing tendency, but with current medical knowledge the combination of clinical history and exposure allows well-trained 
physicians to make the diagnosis of RADS. </p>

<h4><font size=5>I</font>ntroduction</h4>
<p>Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.</p>
<p>Radon decay products attach to particles which are inhaled and become lodged in the lungs. Once lodged, they can radiate and 
penetrate lung tissue initiating the process of carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Smoking increases the risk of exposure to radon.</p>
<p>State surveys to date show that about 1 out of 5 homes has elevated screening levels.</p>
<p>The only way to know if a home has elevated levels of radon is to test it. Testing is simple and easy. Homes with high radon 
levels can be fixed for about $500 to $1,500.</p>
<p>Congress has recognized the health consequences of radon and passed legislation in October 1988 that establishes a national 
goal that indoor radon levels not exceed ambient outdoor radon levels (0.2-0.7 pCi/L). The law recognizes the need for radon 
testing in schools and workplaces and provides funds for states to initiate a variety of radon activities.</p>
<h4><font size=5>O</font>rigin of Radon</h4>
<p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. You cannot see it, smell it, or taste it. Radon comes from the natural breakdown 
(radioactive decay) of uranium. Most soils contain varying amounts of uranium. Since radon is a gas, it can be found just about 
anywhere. It's usually found in rock and soil, but in some cases, well water may be a source of radon, exposing you when you 
are showering, washing clothes, and performing other household activities.</p>
<p>Radon emanates from soil, rock and water into the air we breathe. Outdoors, radon is diluted to low concentrations and poses 
no problem. However, once inside an enclosed space (such as a home) radon can accumulate to significant levels. The 
magnitude of radon buildup indoors depends both on type of construction and concentration of radon in underlying soil.</p>
<p>The soil composition under and around a house affects indoor radon levels and the ease with which radon migrates towards a 
house. Normal pressure differences between the house and the soil can create a slight vacuum in the home which can draw radon 
gas from the soil into the building. Radon gas can enter a home from the soil through dirt floors, cracks in concrete floors and 
walls, floor drains, sumps, joints, and tiny cracks or pores in hollow-block walls. Radon levels are generally highest in basements 
and ground floor rooms in contact with the soil. Factors such as design, construction and ventilation of the home affect the 
pathways and forces which can draw radon indoors.</p>
<h4><font size=5>H</font>ealth Effects</h4>
<p>Radon decay products (polonium-218 and polonium-214, solid form) can attach to the surface of aerosols, dusts, and smoke 
particles which may be inhaled, and become deeply lodged or trapped in the lungs. Once lodged, they can radiate and penetrate 
the cells of mucous membranes, bronchi, and other pulmonary tissues. Energy deposited in these sensitive tissues during 
irradiation is believed to initiate the process of carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>EPA and other scientific organizations estimate that thousands of lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to elevated levels of 
radon. Epidemiological studies of thousands of uranium and other underground miners have been carried out over more than 50 
years in five nations including the U.S. and Canada. These studies provide convincing evidence that exposures to radon and its 
decay products are associated with an increase in lung cancer mortality. The risk of lung cancer is directly proportional to the 
level and duration of exposure. For example in one study, miners with cumulative exposures of about 30 WLM [one WLM is 
equivalent to an average exposure of 1 WL (200 pCi/L) for 170 hours, about 21 workdays] had an increased mortality from 
lung cancer. Similar exposures might result from people living in homes with average radon levels of 4 pCi/L for about 40 years, 
assuming 75% occupancy. In addition to the miner data, radon and its decay products in experimental animals cause lung cancer.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Science's BEIR IV Report, the World Health Organization, the Surgeon General, and other national 
and international authorities have also identified radon as a serious national health problem. Lung cancer due to inhalation of 
radon decay products currently constitutes the only know risk associated with radon. Variables such as age and duration of 
exposure, time since initiation of exposure, and the use of tobacco influence individual risk.</p>
<p>There is evidence from some of the epidemiological studies of underground miners, primarily the U.S. uranium miners, that radon 
exposure and smoking may have a synergistic relationship. Exposure to both may exceed the effects of either alone. However, 
both can act independently to increase the risk of lung cancer. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that the increased 
risk of lung cancer to smokers from radon exposure is 10 or more times greater than to non-smokers.</p>
<p>Some scientific studies of radiation exposure indicate that children may be more sensitive to radon. This may be due to their 
higher respiration rate and their rapidly dividing cells which may be more vulnerable to radiation damage. The International 
Council on Radiation Protection concluded that the relative lung cancer risk to children and youths from radiation may be three 
times that for adults.</p>
<h4><font size=5>R</font>isk of Lung Cancer</h4>
<p>The following risk chart compares exposures to various radon levels over a life time to the risk of developing lung cancer from 
chest x-rays.</p>
<pre>

ANNUAL RADON            IF 1000 PEOPLE WERE EXPOSED     THE RISK COMPARES TO
LEVEL                   TO THIS LEVEL OVER A LIFETIME   HAVING THIS MANY
                                                        CHEST X-RAYS A YEAR

20 pCi/L        About 90 people could get lung cancer    2000 chest X-rays

10 pCi/L        About 50 people could get lung cancer    1000 chest X-rays

4 pCi/L         About 20 people could get lung cancer    400 chest X-rays

2 pCi/L         About 10 people could get lung cancer    200 chest X-rays

1.5 pCi/L                     Average indoor radon level

.5 pCi/L                      Average outdoor radon level

</pre>
<p>The risks shown in the above chart are for the general population. The risks to smokers are even greater because of the 
interaction of the two carcinogens. For example, smoking and being exposed to 4pci/l of radon is like having 800 chest x-rays a 
year. If you have never smoked, being exposed to 4pci/l of radon is like having 80 chest x-rays a year. Children may be more at 
risk from radon than adults because their lungs may be more sensitive to radiation.</p>
<p>Radon is a national environmental health problem. Elevated radon levels have been discovered in virtually every state. The EPA 
estimates that as many as eight million homes throughout the country have elevated levels of radon.</p>
<h4><font size=5>T</font>esting for Radon</h4>
<p>Radon is completely invisible to sight, smell or taste. That's why special detection kits are necessary.</p>
<p>Short-term testing (a few days to several months) is the quickest way to determine if a potential problem exists. Charcoal 
canisters, electret ion detectors and alpha track detectors are currently the most common short-term testing devices. Short-term 
testing should be conducted with the doors and windows shut, preferably during the cooler months of the year.</p>
<p>Long-term testing (up to one year) is the most accurate way to test radon. Alpha track detectors and electret ion detectors are 
the most common long-term testing devices.</p>
<p>Both short-term and long-term testing devices are easy to use and relatively inexpensive.</p>
<p>Both long- and short-term kits can be purchased for about $20, through the mail or from hardware stores or other retail outlets. 
After testing is completed, the kit is simply returned to the manufacturer for analysis. The analysis is usually included in the price 
of the kit. Or, a company can be hired to test a home.</p>
<p>Because no level of radon is considered absolutely safe, radon levels in a home should be reduced as much as possible. The 
average radon level in homes is about 1.5 pCi/L. Action should definitely be taken to reduce radon levels in a home if the 
average annual level is higher than 4 pCi/L. In most cases, radon levels can be reduced to as low as 2 pCi/L to 4 pCi/L, and 
sometimes even below 2 pCi/L.</p>
<p>Short- and long-term results should be interpreted differently. If long-term results are high, homeowners should definitely take 
action to fix their home as soon as possible. If a short-term measurement result is high, the best way to determine the annual level 
is to conduct a long-term test of one year. As radon levels indoors tend to be somewhat higher during the fall and winter, 
short-term measurements made during the cooler months generally overestimate annual levels somewhat. If shout-term test 
results are low, another test sometime in the future is suggested to ensure that a measurement was not conducted at a time when 
radon levels happened to be much lower than usual.</p>
<h4><font size=5>R</font>emediation</h4>
<p>In deciding about remedial action, the risk of exposure as well as the benefits and costs of the remedial actions, including those 
over the long term, should be considered. However, possible risks to the family's health should always be the primary concern. 
The presence of children might encourage remediation of radon levels.</p>
<p>The EPA conducts the Radon Measurement Proficiency Program to evaluate companies that make and analyze test kits. 
Therefore, to ensure the public gets accurate results, people should look for a company that has successfully completed the 
Proficiency Program. Most companies indicate approval on the test kit box. In addition, many states require licensing of radon 
testing companies and contractors. State radon offices have a list of all radon measurement companies that are state or EPA 
approved.</p>
<p>When radon testing indicates elevated radon levels, a trained contractor should be consulted to correct the problem. In most 
cases, homes can be fixed for $500 to $1,500. EPA conducts a Radon Contractor Proficiency Program to evaluate contractors' 
ability to reduce radon levels. The names of these contractors appear in a national listing. Trained radon reduction contractors 
offer their services in virtually every state. Individuals can call the state radon office to locate a contractor.</p>
<p>Radon levels in homes can be reduced by preventing radon entry, increasing the ventilation within the home, and removing radon 
and its decay products from the air. Preventing radon entry is the preferred approach. One of the most effective techniques is 
ventilating the soil surrounding the home so that radon is drawn away before it can enter the home. This method is called soil 
depressurization. This system can be installed in an existing home, or economically installed during construction of a new home.</p>
<h4><font size=5>M</font>ore Information</h4>
<p>More information on how to reduce radon levels in the home can be found in an EPA booklet &quot;Radon Reduction Methods: A 
Homeowner's Guide&quot;, which is available from state radon offices.</p>

<hr>


<p>Each year, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with 52,000 deaths and accounts for one third of all injury deaths in the 
United states . <a href="#1">(1)</a> </p>
<p>TBI is an injury to the head that is documented in a medical record, with one or more of the following conditions attributed to 
head injury: observed or self-reported decreased level of consciousness, amnesia, skull fracture, objective neurologic or 
neuropsychologic abnormality, or diagnosed intracranial lesion; or 2) death resulting from trauma, with head injury listed in the 
sequence of conditions that resulted in death on the death certificate, autopsy report, or medical examiner's report <a href="#2">(2)</a>. </p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 persons who survive TBI incur some loss of function, residual disability, and increased medical-care 
needs because of these injuries <a href="#3">(3)</a>. Major causes of TBI are motor-vehicle crashes, falls, assaults, and sports and recreational 
activities <a href="#4">(3,4)</a>. </p>
<p>During 1992-1993 in Oklahoma, horseback riding was the leading cause of sports-related TBI <a href="#5">(5)</a>. To further characterize 
horseback-riding-associated TBIs, the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) and CDC analyzed these injuries for 
1992-1994. This report summarizes the findings of this analysis. </p>
<p>In 1992, the OSDH established surveillance statewide in Oklahoma for all cases of TBI resulting in death or hospitalization. A 
case is defined as a TBI recorded on a medical examiner report or coded on a hospital discharge report as specified by 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes N800.0-801.9, N803.0-804.9, and N850.9-854.1. Medical 
records of persons with TBI are reviewed by state injury-prevention service personnel at all 125 hospitals in the state either one, 
two, or four times per year (frequency depends on the size of the hospital). A standardized data-collection form is completed for 
each case. Information for all fatal cases is provided by the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which investigates all 
trauma deaths. Horseback riding and other causes of injury are specified in the narrative of the medical record or medical 
examiner report. </p>
<p>During 1992-1994, a total of 9409 TBIs occurred in Oklahoma, of which 109 (1.2%), including three deaths, were associated 
with horseback riding; 23 other TBIs were attributable to horses but were not riding-associated. The numbers of these injuries 
were nearly equal among females (55) and males (54), and riders ranged in age from 3 years to 71 years (median: 30 years). 
Cases occurred more commonly during the spring (38) and summer (34) than winter (19) and autumn (18). Nearly one half 
(48%) of the riding-associated TBIs occurred on a Saturday or Sunday. Of 93 cases for which time of injury was known, 64 
(69%) occurred between noon and 8 p.m. Of the 105 cases for which the mechanism of injury was specified, 100 (95%) 
involved riders who struck their heads either on the ground or a nearby object after falling from the horse, four (4%) who were 
kicked or rolled on by the horse after falling from the horse, and one (1%) who fell to the ground after his head struck a pole 
while riding. Of the 96 persons for whom information on type of activity was available, most (86 [90%]) were associated with 
recreational activity, and 10 (10%) were work-associated. A total of 107 persons were hospitalized (two persons died at the 
scene) and accounted for 388 hospital days (median duration of stay: 2 days). </p>
<p>Among the 106 survivors of riding-associated TBIs, 84 (79%) had one or more indicators of brain injury severity: 67 (63%) had 
loss of consciousness, 49 (46%) had post-traumatic amnesia, and 14 (13%) had persistent neurologic sequelae on discharge 
from the hospital (e.g., seizures or cognitive, hearing, vision, speech, and/or motor impairment). Among those hospitalized, the 
Abbreviated Injury Severity scores [an anatomic injury-severity scale ranging from one for minor injury to six for maximum 
injury] for the head region ranged from two (moderate) (64% of cases) to five (critical) (5% of cases). TBI was listed as the first 
(of a maximum of 10) discharge diagnosis for 90% of the hospitalized cases and as the first or second diagnosis for 99%. </p>
<p>Among the 23 TBIs attributable to horses not identified as riding-associated, 21 (91%) resulted from a direct kick to the head by 
a horse; one person died, and two others required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Thirteen (57%) of these occurred among 
children aged &#190;10 years. Of the 19 cases for which place of injury was specified, 15 occurred on a farm. </p>
<p>Even though only 1% of the TBIs in Oklahoma were associated with horseback riding, the medical burden of these injuries is 
substantial as reflected by the adverse neurologic outcomes and number of hospitalization days. In addition, the 
horseback-riding-associated TBIs described in this report probably underestimate the total number of all such injuries receiving 
medical care. For example, during 1991, 66% of persons in the United States who received medical care for TBIs were not 
hospitalized <a href="#4">(4)</a>, and 79% of regular (i.e., six or more times per year) horseback riders who incurred a concussion or other 
nonfacial head injury were not hospitalized (6; CDC, unpublished date, 1995). In Oklahoma, only persons with TBIs who are 
hospitalized are identified by the surveillance system. </p>
<p>In Oklahoma, during 1992-1994, bicycle riding accounted for more than twice the number of TBIs as horseback riding (234 
versus 109). However, the risk for injury during horseback riding probably was substantially greater than for bicycle riding: 
during 1989-1991, the rate of horseback-riding injury sufficiently severe to require hospital-based emergency care was an 
estimated 28 per 100,000 riding hours <a href="#6">(6)</a>, while the rate for bicycle-associated injuries was 3.7 per 100,000 riding hours <a href="#7">(7)</a>. </p>
<p>The occurrence of most horseback-riding-associated TBIs during warm weather months, on weekends, and in the afternoon 
probably reflects greater ridership during those times. The high proportion of nonriding horse-related TBIs among children 
underscores the need for reducing the risk for direct contact with horses and the importance of using protective head gear for 
children who cannot be continuously surpervised when near horses. </p>
<p>Horseback-riding-associated TBIs can be prevented by wearing protective helmets that meet the American Society of Testing 
and Materials (ASTM) standards <a href="#8">(8)</a>. This measure is based on the documented effectiveness of helmet use for preventing 
bicycle-associated TBI by 88% . <a href="#9">(9)</a>OSDH has included a recommendation for helmet use in the state's Strategic Plan for Injury 
Prevention and Control to promote helmet use among horseback riding clubs and organizations in Oklahoma. Additional efforts 
to prevent this problem should include direct assessment of the effectiveness of helmet use during horseback-riding activities, 
characterization of the biomechanics of horseback-riding-associated injury, educational programs in safe grooming and riding of 
horses, and careful matching of horses and supervision to the skill level of the rider. </p>

<hr>


<p>California's civil courts routinely consider, understand and appreciate the significant impact of brain injury, but when it comes to 
criminal prosecutions our criminal justice system is not designed to provide any special consideration for survivors of traumatic 
brain injury. Brain injury is considered in sentencing criminal offenders, providing the survivor has a well informed advocate, but 
that's really not much solace, when many survivors of brain injury should be diverted from the criminal justice system from the 
outset. </p>
<p>To understand how the system works requires a very basic course in criminal law and practical politics. As a personal injury trial 
lawyer, I am not the best informed on all the intricacies of criminal law, but from years of representing survivors of major trauma, 
I unfortunately understand well the public policies issues that drive our legal system and I know the devastating long-term 
aftermath of a major head injury. So, let's look at how our legal system operates this morning. </p>
<p>California's criminal justice laws are driven by political decisions, which are based on social and moral views concerning crime. In 
general there is an extremely wide range of opinion about how to best deal with crime, stemming from three different positions. </p>
<p>From the first perspective, American society has been too lenient with those who break the law. Accordingly, the most promising 
solution is to get tougher will all criminals, to step up enforcement efforts, appoint tougher judges, impose longer jail sentences 
and build more jails and prison facilities. </p>
<p>The second view believes we can control violent crime by identifying the relatively small group of criminals who are high-rate 
offenders and recognize that in important ways they re not deterred by harsher prison sentences. The only realistic way to deal 
with such chronic criminals is to acknowledge that they are incorrigible. Considering the threat they pose to society, they should 
be locked up indefinitely. </p>
<p>Lastly, a third view argues that it is essential to recognize the corrosive social and economic forces that lead to criminality, and 
make a serious effort not just to contain crime, but to prevent it. Proponents of this position recognize that it is no small task to 
change the social and economic conditions which now provide a breeding ground for crime. As an immediate measure, 
alternatives to incarceration should be explored, alternatives which promise to help offenders return to productive lives. </p>
<p>Each of these perspectives begins with a claimed explanation of why people commit crime. Because very few people are well 
informed about criminal justice issues, political decisions about the causes of crime are based upon totally inaccurate information, 
largely from television and newspapers. </p>
<p>News by definition is the unusual, strange, aberrant, and the exception to the norm, i.e. it is newsworthy. </p>
<p>In today's world, on a slow news day criminal violence that occurred somewhere you never heard of is reported locally, not just 
once, but more than a 1,000 times a day in morning television, drive-time radio, t.v. &quot;live at five&quot; evening news, and the statistical 
1.7 newspapers skimmed by your average metropolitan Californian. We are inundated with news concerning crime because it 
presents visually and it &quot;sells newspapers.&quot; </p>
<p>The end result is that day-after-day repetition of the strange, the exotic and the unusual has led many voters to believe the 
criminal justice system is bizarre. So it is no surprise that nearly every voter will tell you that the criminal does not work, that 
wholesale numbers go scott free, that the courts are run by lunatics and are supervised by appellate courts which are even worse. </p>
<p>On the other side of the ledger, nobody ever reports, and I doubt few in this room, let alone any newspaper editor, assignment 
editor or reporter, can tell us, how many people were sentenced to state prison in the Bay Area this month, or the total number 
of county jail inmates at any one time, because that just isn't news. </p>
<p>So in large part, our criminal justice system has been dictated by the average politician's response to voters who know that the 
answer is to &quot;lock them up.&quot; Like any other field of endeavor, if without special training or experience someone immediately 
knows the answer to a complex problem and can readily dictate an obvious solution, they clearly have not thought through the 
question or considered the ramifications of their solution. That is our criminal justice system in a nutshell. </p>
<p>Historically the principal issues in every criminal trial are two fold: did he/she commit a specified act and did he/she intend to do 
it. </p>
<p>Largely intent is derived from the fact that some complex act was attempted, such as armed robbery of a bank. By the time the 
robber obtains the gun, walks in, presents the demand note and terrorizes the bank teller, it is pretty clear he/she intended to rob 
a bank. </p>
<p>Analysis of levels of intent is critical to determine the level of punishment in our system of justice. </p>
<p>For instance, if a person commits murder, but is legally insane, there is no criminal punishment because in large part, they are 
outside the system of rational adults and are unable to appreciate the nature or quality of their act and do not know the difference 
between right or wrong. </p>
<p>If there is no cold, cunning, preconceived and premeditated plan to kill, but a momentary rage or blindness to reality driven by an 
emotional outburst which results in a death, most states recognize this mental state as less culpable than cold-blooded murder, 
and hold the wrongdoer responsible for second degree murder, with a lesser penalty. If there is no specific intent to kill, but 
conduct in conscious or reckless disregard of life results in death, we generally find those persons not guilty of murder, but of 
manslaughter, with a lesser penalty. </p>
<p>The key to understanding these different levels of murder is that the criminal justice system is focusing on the actor's cognitive 
skills to determine the extent of liability and only in cases where the actor meets a 100% standard does exculpation occur. </p>
<p>The rules are simplistically designed to be &quot;all or nothing&quot; because they were generated by a political process. Either the killer 
was insane or not. There is no middle ground or sliding scale. We all know that, except in the rarest of cases, nothing is 100% 
pure and &quot;all or nothing&quot; rules do not reflect clinical realities. </p>
<p>Similarly in the evaluation of competency to stand trial, we also evaluate cognitive skill on an absolute basis. In order to stand trial 
one must be presently free of a mental disease, mental defect or mental disorder the nature or severity of which precludes the 
accused [that also is a 100% standard] from understanding the nature of the proceedings or the ability to cooperate with his/her 
attorney. </p>
<p>This inflexibility in defining mental status by absolute, &quot;either/or,&quot; rules, occurs because our criminal justice system serves many 
functions. First it is a blend of political, constitutional, moral, and personal judgments forged in a political process controlled by 
voter expectations. It states the moral values of the community. It is intended to deter the populace generally, although not all 
activity can be deterrent. It is intended to specifically deter wrongdoers by taking them out of circulation with the general 
populace, and it is intended to punish. </p>
<p>There is one thing it is not designed to do and that is, it is no longer designed to treat or rehabilitate, although unquestionably 90% 
of all convicted criminals at some time will be back on the street. The American public has not figured that out just yet, because 
the bill has not gotten big enough, although that day appears to be coming soon. </p>
<p>This is not a cynical view, but in a world of limited resources choices have to be made about allocating resources and until such 
time as the public understands that our prison system is the most pervasive, and unnecessarily expensive, in the world - once that 
fact becomes a reality for the body politic - the next step will be to determine why the politicians have been approaching the issue 
&quot;unscientifically&quot; or perhaps &quot;with little business or economic sense.&quot; Once the case is stated in those terms, as opposed to the 
current public fear of crime and concern for personal safety, there will be wholesale changes in our criminal law. </p>
<p>As it stands today, the criminal justice system is primarily intended to serve public safety. Criminal law is drafted to reflect 
widespread public fear and misinformation about the causes and prevention of crime. As a result there no special place for or 
appreciation for the role or impact of traumatic brain injuries in the current system, because the survivor of traumatic brain injury 
does not fit into the all or none thinking of our law. </p>
<p>The only arena in which traumatic brain injury is considered is in post- conviction settings, even though a good case can and 
should be made that politically, morally, and economically many survivors of brain injury should not be involved in the criminal 
justice system at all, but the traumatically brain injured have not sufficiently impacted the criminal justice system in any one county 
to merit economic consideration. It is only a matter of time until that occurs since the rate of persons being diagnosed as brain 
injured has been occurring at a relatively constant rate of approximately 2,000 per year here in Santa Clara County and once 
seriously injured complete cures are rare. Demographically, three quarters of the victims are males, one half of whom are ages 15 
to 34. They are the &quot;go for the gusto,&quot; high speed, consumers of alcohol who are going to live forever and who dominate ERs 
Friday night through Sunday morning and the Monday morning arraignment calendars in the courthouse. From a public health 
perspective, the top priorities for public education are alcohol abuse, roll bars, air bags, and helmet protection for motorcyclists, 
bicyclists, skateboarders, and skiers. These annual conferences clearly are making an important contribution to raising the 
public's knowledge on this issue, but the number of TBI persons is not expected to significantly diminish over the next ten years. </p>
<p>In my practice I have learned that there is widespread misunderstanding concerning traumatic brain injury even in otherwise 
knowledgeable medical circles. Anecdotal evidence does not replace scientific research, bur recently in one of my cases a well 
regarded Welch Road neurologist concluded that a moderate head injury in a bicycle/truck collision, which resulted in a fractured 
bicycle helmet, was not responsible for chronic fatigue six months post-injury. Even after presented well documented medical 
references describing fatigue as as the most common complaint in two-thirds of all minimal to moderate head injury patients, the 
practitioner still opined that the fatigue was simply secondary to depression, unrelated to the head injury. Such a misinformed 
view by a treating physician is devastating for the victim and in this case her ability to achieve fair compensation in a strongly 
contested case of liability. </p>
<p>At the criminal justice level, next to nobody, including public defenders and judges, appreciates that TBI has been closely 
associated with criminal histories and specifically with violent rages. Current research from the University of Chicago by Dr. 
Stuart Yudofsky shows that the most common cause of explosive anger is brain injury or neurological disease and that there are 
now medications available to control violent rage. Beta-blockers can be used to effectively treat not only high blood pressure, 
but also violent rages. This research is confirmed by the University of Pennsylvania study of 286 psychiatric patients who showed 
unprovoked rage; in that cohort 94% had some kind of brain damage. </p>
<p>And all this is of dramatic consequence since it correlates with the studies by Dr. Dorothy Lewis of the NYU School of 
Medicine, and others, of 15 death row inmates in the American Journal of Psychiatry [143:7, July, 1986] and a separate study of 
31 incarcerated delinquents reported in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [1987, 26, 
5:744-752]. There is no question that much violent crime can be traced to brain injury, especially in criminals who are repeatedly 
violent. While brain damage alone may not be likely to promote intense violence, the most lethal combination is a history of 
neurological damage and abuse in childhood. When a child has some organic vulnerability, like a brain injury, and is raised in a 
violent household in which the child has been brutally abused and has witnesses extreme violence, then the end result is a very 
violent person. </p>
<p>In addition Dr. Lewis's research found that victims of physical abuse were readily distinguished as more aggressive. As Dr. Lewis 
explains, &quot;children imitate what they see. * * * Second, the kind of abuse to which such children are subject often results in injury 
to the central nervous system. This injury, in turn, contributes to the impulsiveness, emotional instability, an cognitive impairment 
that diminishes their ability to control their behaviors. * * * Finally, the brutality directed toward these children engenders 
extraordinary rage and contributes to their paranoid orientation. * * * (T)his rage is rarely directed toward the abusing parent but 
rather is displaced onto a host of others in the abused child's environment, teachers, peers and police.&quot; </p>
<p>As a consequence, individuals with &quot;this combination of vulnerabilities are especially at risk for committing violent acts when 
confronted with stressful stimuli, such as interpersonal discord, sexual frustration, and verbal or physical provocation. Their 
threshold for aggression is lowered even further by ingestion of alcohol or drugs. </p>
<p>Dr. Lewis terms this condition Limbic Psychotic Aggressive Syndrome, which is an important step forward in forensic psychiatry 
rather than trying to explain the conduct of repeatedly violent individuals whose disorders do not fit current diagnoses conduct 
disorders or anti-social personality. </p>
<p>Lewis's work confirms that there is a &quot;constellation of neuropsychiatric and experiential factors that differentiate&quot; violent 
delinquents from nondelinquents and provides a scientific foundation for the forensic psychiatrist to move the debate from issues 
of guilt and punishment to treatment and prevention. </p>
<p>Against these exciting developments in understanding of the causes of violent crime, we find ourselves confronting the real world 
where millions are spent on modern jails that lack funding for adequate operating budgets and where the director of the county's 
mental health unit resigns after a team of state experts roundly criticized the county jail's program from inadequate staffing, to 
failing to diagnose and treat, to ignoring mental health patients, to failing to prevent suicides. </p>
<p>At the same time, not surprisingly, a nationwide survey has ranked California 31st among the states in the delivery of mental 
health services, a further decline form its 25th place two years ago. The survey by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 
which was conducted by the Public Citizen Health Research Group, rates Los Angeles as having the worst public mental health 
services of any major city in the nation. Particularly striking was the report's conclusion that 3,600 severely mentally ill inmates 
housed in Los Angeles County Jails comprise the &quot;largest de facto mental institution in the nation.&quot; </p>
<p>I know from my own practice and working closely with the families of survivors and their health care providers that there is no 
organized long-term system of care for the traumatically brain injured in our area. TBI patients without families are relegated to 
the street or incorrectly diagnosed as mentally ill. For those with families, the families do not simply become care providers: they 
suffer one of the most outrageous burdens that destroys families, causes siblings to leave home prematurely, and mandates that 
someone give up their life to care for the injured. That's why the research of Dr. Harvey Jacobs on the long term impact of brain 
injury is so extremely important and why I seek and value his assistance in court to explain that the real impact is continuous, 
never ending, and always fraught with on-going disaster. </p>
<p>So it is no surprise that when survivors of traumatic brain injury encounter the courts, it takes substantial litigation muscle to get 
the system to comprehend the special needs of the brain injured. </p>
<p>So what do I propose? </p>
<p>First, our system of mental health evaluations needs to look at states like Massachusetts which have established fully operating 
psychiatric clinics in the courthouse. The clinic provides evaluation, therapy, education and consultation, research and 
supervision. At the Cambridge Massachusetts Court Clinic, operated by Dr. James C. Beck, the major focus of daily activity 
involves the evaluation and treatment of individuals referred through their contact with the court system as part of the state 
Department of Mental Health and as an academic division of the Department of Psychiatry at the Cambridge Hospital, Harvard 
Medical School. Staff psychiatrists are called on daily for in-court emergency consultations. In addition, psychiatrists and other 
staff members offer on-going therapy. </p>
<p>What has evolved is an on-going partnership venture between mental health professionals and the trial court which provides a 
wide a variety of clinical services in an effort to serve the generally underserved court-related individual and his/her family, of 
which perhaps the most valuable is prompt and early diagnosis, evaluation and referral. </p>
<p>But the real benefit of the system is that it provides the court, judges, probation officers, mental health, schools, social services 
and youth services with immediate access and daily contact with mental health professionals. </p>
<p>Although no empirical data is available, a system such as this is probably more cost effective than those which fail to identify and 
divert individuals from the expense of the criminal justice system. </p>
<p>Prompt identification is the key. </p>
<p>Because the number of TBI patients present a small problem in any city or county, a stateside system of prompt identification and 
verification would well serve this population. The State of California's computerized Criminal Information and Identification 
system, known as C.I. &amp;I., can and should identify victims of TBI. I realize of course the thin line between identification and 
stigmatization, but when a survivor of brain injury is arrested, anything that can minimize and avoid the abuse of incarceration and 
result in diversion to a treatment program or special placement should be pursued. The State's computerize system contains 
substantial controls preventing unauthorized access to the data base, including strong documentation and recording of access. In 
short, this statewide system has extremely good security and will not stigmatize victims, but will aid in providing realistic options. 
It is used by every law enforcement agency in the state and is routinely accessed at the time of booking. Identification of persons 
with brain injury at this stage would greatly assist in in-take classification and release on own recognizance decisions. Hopefully at 
some time in the future it would also serve to aid in diversion as well. And that brings me to my last point. In large part many 
survivors of brain injury, who are not violent, do not belong in the criminal justice system. But before the public recognizes that 
fact that a substantial public education effort is needed. </p>
<p>So lastly, I challenge you to make the legal system respond to the advances being made in understanding the role of brain injury 
by taking the forefront in an educational effort directed to both the bench and bar. A series of local programs for both 
prosecutors and defenders, followed by presentations to the annual meetings of the California Judges' Association, California 
District Attorneys' Association, California Public Defenders' Association and California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, will 
advance the time for better understanding of the long term impact of traumatic brain injury on the victims as well as the 
community. Once this occurs the next step of changing state law to aid diversion from the criminal justice system will be more 
easily accomplished. </p>
