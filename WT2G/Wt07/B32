<H1>Media Kit</H1>

<P>
A media kit need not be in glossy full color.  It usually consists
of a folder with pockets, which contain information on the product
or service.  The information contained in the press kit usually
includes several components:  
<UL>
<LI>A business card which is glued on the pocket or set in die
cuts.
<LI>A background sheet on the history of the area, attraction,
business and owner.  The philosophy of the company or what makes
it unusual is generally included with hours of operation, the
products sold or services offered, etc.  
<LI>Press clippings of coverage (copies) may also be included
to add credibility (only 2 or 3 of the best stories are needed).
 
<LI>A brochure which includes a diagram of the product and directions
to the company.  Photos really do say a thousand words, so try
to include a color copy or, if budget permits, a color slide.
 Your media kit must paint a picture of your story.   
<LI>Some PR professionals like to include &quot;canned&quot;,
pre-written features, but our advice is that pre-written material
should rarely be used.
<LI>If a promotional item is available (a sticker, a luggage tag,
a button), include it if your budget allows.  Remember to factor
in postage cost.  Sometimes small gift items are included, such
as flower seeds sent by a seed distributor.  
<LI>Video releases are also becoming more common in reaching the
media.  As the world becomes more visually oriented, video footage
is often an easier way to communicate a message to media.  Obviously
there is a cost involved and not all journalists have access to
a VCR.  If a video release is used, the need for the written media
release still remains vitally important as an introduction and
accompaniment.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Again, the envelope and folder are important, because you must
generate enough interest for the journalist to take the time,
open the envelope, look through the folder and glance at the headline
on the press release in the right-hand pocket.  So, making an
effort to decorate the folder and/or envelope with a photo or
pasted company logo/design is usually worth the time and expense.
 Make the overall presentation intriguing-but with easy-to-find
information.  You may want to stairstep the information (with
background sheets of different heights, from the first sheet peeking
out just above the pocket and building incrementally to the last
page at 11 inches in height).

<H1>Media Release</H1>

<P>
The key to a good media release is to give accurate, pertinent
facts that answer who, what, when, where and why.  Journalists
are sometimes wary when they see superlatives and adjectives (best,
biggest, most, cheapest, etc.) in the copy.  Make sure the information
is accurate.  If you can't verify a fact, don't include it.  If
you have support documentation (a photo, research statistics,
a registration form), attach it to the release.  A release is
not an opportunity to write that novel you've always dreamed about.
 Keep it concise, make sure the headline will draw attention,
and present important information.
<P>
Include contact information (name and phone number are a must),
keep the copy in the active voice, have a friend proofread it
and try to include a quote from someone who can substantiate and
give credibility to your message.  If your event is open to the
media, list the location and event time.  Is the news time-related?
 Then mention the release date, and be certain to send the information
early enough for each media market:  magazines, three months to
two years; newspapers, three days to six weeks depending on the
section; television, one day to two months; radio, one day to
one month.  Mention additional documentation photos, interviews,
etc. which are available.  Make the ONE page release easy to read-double-
or triple- spaced on white or a light-colored paper.  Avoid acronyms
and industry jargon.  BE CREATIVE!  
<P>
Make your release stand apart from the other 50 white envelopes
with releases in them that hit a journalist's basket each day
by including colorful designs on the envelope, or use an unusual
size of envelope.  What would make you open an obvious solicitation
mailing?  One Department of Energy PR professional super-glued
plastic fish (her cost was $.25 per release) to her release on
watershed protection. Make certain you are mailing or faxing the
release to the appropriate person and that you are spelling the
journalist's name correctly.
<P>
At the time of this printing, most media releases are still sent
by mail.  However, more and more journalists are going on-line,
and releases may be sent by e-mail.  From anecdotal information
collected, approximately 30 percent of Oregon media are on-line,
60 percent of the top national publications (magazine and newspapers)
are on-line and nationally, approximately 30 percent of journalists
get their information on-line.

<br><HR>


<H1>Create your Media Relations Plan</H1>

<H2>Step 1:  Determine your media relations goal(s).</H2>

<P>
Example:  To reach more families in the San Francisco market by
placing stories in Bay Area newspapers and city/community magazines
such as San Francisco Focus, the Lifestyle section of the San
Francisco Chronicle, etc.
<H2>Step 2:  Determine who you are and what your story is.</H2>

<P>
Determine what is newsworthy about your story.  What makes you
different?  Keep in mind that the story should be of interest
to the particular audience you are trying to reach, and be critically
honest.  Does it pass the &quot;Who cares?&quot; test?  Are you
the only person who cares about the product or service, or would
a specific audience really be interested?  Perhaps your story
is about a new wine being served, a new chef, a children's attraction,
a new historical tour, a recycling program or a new product that
is being launched.  
<H2>Step 3:  Determine who your customers are and, subsequently,
who your media targets are.</H2>

<P>
Media relations is the means of conveying messages to the public
through the media.  Developing a list of media outlets (newspapers,
radio stations, magazines or television stations) and determining
who might be interested in your story is important.  Watch for
bylines, or note a journalist's name in publications you read.
 There are many reference books that include information on media
outlets, the size of their readership, viewership or listenership,
and contact information.  These references may be found in your
library.  They include:  Bacon's Publicity Checker, Editor &amp;
Publisher International Yearbook, BPI Media Services, Writer's
Market, Gebbie Press, and Broadcasting &amp; Cable Marketplace.
 
<P>
Familiarity with the media outlets and their reporters will help
you determine who to contact with your story idea (food editor,
assignment editor, living section editor, morning deejay).  Seek
out connections you may have with local media through local civic
organizations or friends.  Once you have established a connection
with a journalist, nurture the relationship through press kit/news
release mailings when appropriate.  Target the appropriate media
for each story.  Remember to concentrate on local coverage, and
then expand to larger markets.  Larger media markets are more
difficult to reach and generate a story within, unless particularly
appropriate to your product or service.  If you offer tours of
Oregon for European customers, for example, then target European
publications.

<H2>Step 4:  What is your message?</H2>

<BR>
You have determined who you are and what you are &quot;selling&quot;,
but how are you differentiating yourself from the rest of the
pack (i.e., your competition)?  Because we are so close to our
product/service, it is difficult to see ourselves and our &quot;goods&quot;
as everyone else does.  Take advantage of networks you are part
of in order to bounce ideas off of colleagues.  For the cost of
a lunch you may develop some excellent ideas on how to stand apart
from the competition.  For example, one national video store conducted
an event for families to come in and videotape their children.
 It was a fun thing for families to do (this was at the advent
of video cameras, when they were a novelty), and the video the
family created  served as a record of the child's height, build
and visage for security purposes.  Thus, the promotion was a public
service for store patrons.  
<H2>Step 5:  How will you convey your message to the media?</H2>

<BR>
The primary ways of communicating your story to the media include:
<ul><li>
Face-to-face visits
<li>
Media release
<li>
Personal letter
<li>
Press conferences
<li>
Press kit
<li>
Slides and photos (usually part of the press kit)
<li>
Telephone calls
<li>
Word of mouth/networking/personal experience
</ul><BR>

<br><HR>

<H1>Media Relations Do's and Don'ts</H1>

<H2>Do your homework.</H2>

<P>
Find out what topics a targeted journalist covers.  What section
does she write for?  What is a recent story she has written/produced
that you can refer to?  What are her personal interests?  Is she
familiar with your service/product?  Is she new to the media outlet
or to the region of the country?  What are her deadlines and lead-times?
 Ask her what she is looking for in a story.  Does a photo help?
 Is she on-line?  Does she read on-line releases, or does she
prefer mail or fax?
<H2>Do nurture personal relationships with journalists.  </H2>

<P>
Contacting one journalist you know personally is likely to turn
up more coverage than sending out 1,000 releases to media outlets
that aren't in your target market and/or for which you don't have
a specific name.  Don't send a press release to a newspaper without
a contact name; it's worth a phone call to get a properly spelled
name.
<H2>Do stop at news stands and pick up publications with which
you are not familiar, but which might be likely candidates for
a story.</H2>

<P>
Take the name of the appropriate editor and the address for the
publication with you.  Reading an airline in-flight magazine is
an excellent time to find out who is writing what.  If a freelancer
is contributing the story, look for a mini-bio at the front of
the publication or immediately following the last sentence of
the story.
<H2>Don't forget your own backyard.</H2>

<P>
Yes, a story on the evening network news would be wonderful coverage
to receive, but don't put all of your efforts into striving for
something that's nearly impossible.  Target your local newspaper,
magazines and television stations, and when you have time, approach
the nationally televised shows.  Often a national network will
learn about a story after it has been run by a network affiliate.
<H2>Do be persistent, but don't be a pest.  </H2>

<P>
Stay in touch with your media contacts, but don't inundate them
with frivolous stories that aren't newsworthy (remember the &quot;Who
cares?&quot; test) or that don't pertain to their readers, listeners
or viewers.
<H2>Do give contact information on all materials you send out,
including a name, phone number and address.</H2>

<P>
If you will be away from the office attending an event for which
you sent out a release, make sure it includes contact information,
so the media can reach you even during non-office hours.
<H2>Do take a  journalist's response of &quot;I don't think I
can use this story, but call me if something else interesting
turns up&quot; as positive.</H2>

<P>
Accept a &quot;no&quot; this time, and thank her for her willingness
to listen.
<H2>Do be honest!</H2>

<P>
Be an expert on the story you're pitching, but tell her  when
you don't have an answer . . . and get back to her.

<H1>Phone and Face-to-Face Media Calls</H1>

<P>
Like you, journalists are very busy people. However, they have
the additional burden of an ever looming deadline hanging over
their heads.  Be sensitive to their schedules.  (Don't call a
television newsroom at 4 p.m. as they're preparing for the 5 p.m.
news and ask if it is a good time for a brief chat.)  Even if
you think they know who you are, remind them, and succinctly tell
them the reason for your call.  
<P>
Try to engage the journalist quickly with your story, or convince
him to give you ten minutes for a face-to-face meeting.  It is
important to be genuine, both on the phone and in person, and
not be overly consumed with the importance of your story.  Obviously,
the story dictates the tone of the meeting (serious, fun, etc.),
but try not to dominate the conversation with a 15- minute speech.
 Be a good listener.  If you don't know the answer to a journalist's
question, tell him you'll do some research and follow up promptly.
 
<P>
If you run into a dead end with a journalist, ask if there is
another journalist at that media outlet for whom the story might
be appropriate.  You cannot dictate anything to a journalist:
 whether to write the story, how to write the story, or when to
write the story.  Again, keep in mind that a long-term, positive
relationship with a journalist is more important than placing
an individual story.
<P>
Keep your telephone call or face-to-face meeting brief, and follow
up with requested information.  If you take more time than the
journalist can afford, he won't be as willing to talk/meet with
you next time.
<P>
A follow-up thank you note for meeting in person or for a story
is a professional gesture that will further nurture the long-term
relationship.

<br><HR>
<H1>Activities for Generating Awareness</H1>

<H2>1. Hold a contest.</H2>

<P>
Trade out time on the air or in print in exchange for tickets
to your event, attraction, etc. Have a photo contest, a drawing
for a trip, or a recipe contest featuring locally grown products.
<H2>2. Hold a press conference.</H2>

<P>
Make certain it is visual.  Does the story work better for print
(longer, in depth coverage of stories of a static nature) or television
(a newborn animal at a local zoo).
<H2>3. Send out a press release/video release.</H2>

<P>
Make sure you're getting the information to the right person.
<H2>4. Conduct radio interviews.</H2>

<P>
Deliver breakfast to deejays during the early-morning rush hour.
 Follow up a press release, and set up an interview with your
business' spokesperson and local media.
<H2>5. Host a sampling event.</H2>

<P>
A sampling of a food product or a casting demonstration for a
new fly rod.
<H2>6. Media Tour</H2>

<P>
Have your business' spokesperson visit media in targeted markets.
<H2>7. School Promotions</H2>

<P>
Offer curriculum, clean-up (SOLV) programs, coloring contests
or field trips.
<H2>8. Stage an event.</H2>

<P>
Pinpoint why you wish to stage the event, and make certain your
message and your event sponsor's message are communicated.
<H2>9. Issue a proclamation.</H2>

<P>
Typically issued from a government agency (Mayor's Office, Governor's
Office) it usually generates local coverage if truly newsworthy,
unusual or includes good back-up information on why the proclamation
has been issued.
<H2>10. Media Kit Mailing</H2>

<H2>11. Public Service Announcement (PSA)</H2>

<P>
Produced in both audio and video format, it is wise to approach
the radio and television stations in advance to make certain that
the efforts and money put towards producing a psa actually pays
off by eliciting airtime.
<H2>12. Speakers Bureau</H2>

<P>
Have a team of ambassadors that can speak about your issue or
business.  Make service organizations, event coordinators and
business organizations aware that the speakers are available.
 Send out a mailing of who the speakers are, what visuals are
available, etc.
<H2>13. Business Cards</H2>

<P>
Create mini-stat sheets that can printed on the backs of business
cards.  If a group of international visitors is coming to town,
print key welcoming phrases on a business card, so it serves as
a cheat sheet.  Words such as welcome, good morning, thank you
and good-bye are helpful, with phonetic pronunciations.  These
could be made available to employees working the front lines,
welcome center volunteers, etc.
<H2>14. Volunteer Hand-outs</H2>

<P>
Send volunteers out during rush hour to pass out cookies to greet
visitors, or clowns to hand out buttons/balloons to kids.
<H2>15. Writing Contest</H2>

<P>
Host a writing contest and tie in a corporate sponsor who prefers
to sponsor educational activities.  Have the winning essays published.
<H2>16. Volunteer Information</H2>

<P>
Have volunteers at key information sources (gas stations for visitors)
give excellent advice and distribute maps and something indigenous
to the area.
<H2>17. Information Centers</H2>

<P>
Add new information at key information points (rest stops for
visitors) with new, up-to-date information, as well as information
concerning how important their visit is to the area.
<H2>18. Legislative Buy-In</H2>

<P>
Have a local organization host a legislator or key influencer
monthly, with updates on economic development activities and tourism
programs.
<H2>19. Community Quiz</H2>

<P>
Issue a quiz through a local paper with questions on the visitor
industry and visitor attractions.  (How deep is Hells Canyon?)
 Introduce a product inventory (what your community has to offer
a visitor) through the quiz.
<H2>20. Surveys</H2>

<P>
Conduct research with visitors in town and release it to the media.
 Stop visitors in the downtown area and conduct &quot;on the street
live reports&quot; of visitors' experiences.
<H2>21. Banners</H2>

<P>
Drape banners with key messages in the downtown, high traffic
areas.
<H2>22. Product Co-ops</H2>

<P>
Put your message on a locally produced product label, or use the
product as a giveaway (microbrewed beer, wines, tea, chowder,
kites)
<H2>23. Newsletter</H2>

<P>
Create a regular newsletter (quarterly or monthly) with updates
on your business, region, etc., and mail it to a list of key influencers.
<H2>24. Direct Mail</H2>

<P>
Create a brochure or mailing that can be direct mailed to a list
of individuals that are targeted for your needs.  Mailing lists
can be purchased based on psycho-graphic information.  Partner
with a bank or utility company and have them include your mailer
in one of their monthly mailings.
<H2>25. Advertising</H2>

<P>
Advertise in business or regional publications on the importance
of the issue.
<H2>26. Conduct hospitality training or business leadership classes
in your area and invite the community to attend.</H2>

<H2>27. Volunteers</H2>

<P>
For volunteer activities, advertise or generate media coverage
of the importance of volunteers to your business and/or promote
an activity that includes volunteers.  How many hours have they
worked for the organization?  Is there a group affiliation of
the volunteers (PTA, AARP, etc.)?
<H2>28. Printing Projects</H2>

<P>
Restaurant  placemats, bumper stickers, pins or posters can be
printed and distributed with a diagram of how the industry affects
many non-traditional visitor businesses and jobs such as department
stores, galleries, wineries, bakeries, utility companies, graphic
designers, architects, etc.
<H2>29. Scavenger Hunts</H2>

<P>
Have locals participate in a treasure hunt that takes them to
the attractions of the area.
<H2>30. Payroll</H2>

<P>
Pay visitor industry employees in two dollar bills (or have visitor
industry employees purchase all groceries and restaurant bills
with two dollar bills), so the community can see how quickly the
money is circulated throughout the community. Have travel suppliers
give visitors two dollar bills as change, to demonstrate how quickly
the money works through the community.
<H2>31. Billboards</H2>

<P>
Buy billboards that convey the importance of the industry message.
<H2>32. FAM Tour</H2>

<P>
Conduct a familiarization tour of local attractions with regional
dignitaries as guests.
<H2>33. Ambassador Program</H2>

<P>
Have key business leaders serve as local ambassadors,  They officially
greet visiting dignitaries and serve as an area representative
when traveling.  Suitcases, luggage tags and garment bags could
all have the awareness campaigns key phrase printed on them.
<H2>34. Industry Forum</H2>

<P>
Have business leaders convene with a local dignitary for a forum
to discuss the state of the industry and future plans.
<H2>35. School Programs</H2>

<P>
Select high school students to work at visitor attractions for
credit, to introduce them to the visitor industry.  Include students
in business meetings and industry forums when possible.
<H2>36. Employee Appreciation </H2>

<P>
Organize a &quot;vote for your favorite visitor industry employee&quot;
contest, with the winner(s) being awarded a trip throughout the
region.  This could include restaurant, lodging, attraction, airline,
tour operator, etc.
<H2>37. State Police</H2>

<P>
Have state troopers pull visitors to the side of the road and
share a travel guide with free coupons to visitor attractions.
 Make the &quot;arrested&quot; visitors VIP's for the day.

A marketing and sales background, a creative and entreprenurial nature and an MA in Business Management.  If anyone has suggestions or is interested in specifics about my qualifications I will be happy to forward a resume to you.  Please contact me at my e-mail address.  Thank you, John

David,Could not figure out how to utilize TICO's Discussion Groups.  All the links seemed to be dead ends or circular references.  I'm confused!  Although, it could also be my internet ignorance shining through.  Please let me know how this program works.

I would like to participate if possible.Thanks, John StavrosOregon Outdoors Magazinejdstav@bendnet.com

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Hello.  Welcome to Mannatech's Automated Customer
Service Agent. <BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mannatech has a new online telephone system that
allows associates to quickly access information about orders,
checks, QV and leadership and All Star status.  To access the
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, call <B>(972) 602-3035</B>
and have your Control Number ready in order to log into the system.
 After gaining access to the IVR, select from the following menu
items:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>1</B> to access information about orders.
 You will need the order number to access this information.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>2</B> to access information about your
last 4 checks.  The last 4 digits of your Tax ID number is required
to access this information.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>3</B> to obtain the current month's
qualifying volume.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>4</B> to obtain your leadership and
All Star status (based on last commission run).</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>5</B> to access order, QV or leadership
and All Star information on associates in your downline.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Press <B>9</B> to disconnect from the IVR system.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When accessing information through the IVR, you should
be aware of the following:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Orders cannot be placed through the IVR system.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Automatic orders cannot be checked because the
system requests an order number when accessing check information.
 The associate will not know the order number of an automatic
order.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>You can verify a <I>phone</I> order is in the
system 5 minutes after the order is placed.  Shipping information
for the order will not be available for 24 hours or until the
order is shipped.   </FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A faxed or mailed order will be in the system
24 to 48 hours after the order is <I>received</I> by Mannatech.
 You must contact customer service to obtain the order number
for mailed and faxed orders.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Orders paid for with a credit card are not shipped
until the credit card clears processing.  Wait 1 business day
after placing the order before attempting to access information
about a credit card order. The IVR system will let you know if
there was a problem processing your credit card order.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Orders are shipped 24-48 hours after receipt
of an order (next day orders arriving before noon on a business
day are shipped same day).  The shipping status of an order and
its qualifying volume are automatically given as part of the order
information.</FONT>

It is then transferred to the RNA which is the duplicate blueprint required to express this information. This message is then put into the language of cell (glycoform) through the use of eight known saccharides. These glycoforms are then attached to proteins which create glycoproteins. Glycoproteins then penetrate the outer cell wall to enable the genetically coded information of that cell to be communicated to other cells.</I><BR><BR><BR>Those who do not know much about Mannatech Inc., had better get prepared! Mannatech, a three-year-old company located in Grand Prairie, Texas, has been patiently laying the groundwork to become a major player in the complementary health care industry that is exploding worldwide. The company's unprecedented commitment to research and development has propelled it years ahead of the nutritional pack and onto the same playing field shared by some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. All are developing patented technologies that meet the criteria for a new category of health care products.<BR>The focus is nutraceuticals, the new term used by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to describe functional food products with a proven relationship to health maintenance. Their potential for revolutionizing our attitudes toward nutrition and health has led companies worldwide on an all-out search for new functional food patents.<BR>While Mannatech has been quietly building an Associate base of over 150,000 and processing a monthly wholesale product sales volume exceeding $8 million, (as of September 1996), the company has been proactive in securing its position in an industry that Newsweek sees as the "next financial blockbuster." The launch of this industry is facilitated by two enormous factors: One is demand, the other legislation. <BR><BR><BR><H3>The Demand</H3>A recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), estimated that 40% of Americans have turned away from the traditional use of drugs and are searching for alternative products to treat their medical problems. The reasons most often cited for this change were that drugs are (1) too toxic, (2) too expensive, and (3) too unreliable. A CBS story on the same subject estimated the number to be in the range of 50%.<BR>Based on this trend of taking responsibility for one's own health, Mannatech has established itself as the forerunner in an industry that provides products to help maintain optimal good health. Thus, the need for expensive, potentially toxic and sometimes unreliable drug therapy may be minimized before it even becomes necessary.<BR><BR><BR><H3>The Legislation</H3>In October of 1994, the President signed into law the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). As a manifestation of public opinion, this legislation demonstrates the trend for consumers to take responsibility for their own health maintenance programs.<BR>The DSHEA was written to empower American consumers to make choices about their own preventative healthcare programs so that the need for expensive drugs is minimized.<BR>In the DSHEA, Congress acknowledged that:<BR><BR>1) Science has linked good nutrition and the benefits of dietary supplements with health promotion and disease prevention;<BR><BR>2) Preventative health measures, including appropriate use of safe dietary supplements will decrease disease; and<BR><BR>3) Prevention of disease will reduce the country's health care expenses.<BR><BR>The commission on Dietary Supplement Labels, set up by the DSHEA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are currently working out specifics of how the law will be enforced. The original target date of late 1996 has been extended; and while the deadline for completing this enormous task remains uncertain, the industry is moving ahead and taking on a life of its own. This has created an environment in which Mannatech is solidifying its initial successes and preparing to move to the next levels in both products and business.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Big Bucks</H3>Providing access to natural, non-toxic health care products for the public has proven to be overwhelmingly successful in Europe where nutraceuticals have been marketed for several years. The JAMA issue of February 22, 1995, reported that in 1993 over $7 billion was spent on nutraceuticals in Germany alone. Nutraceutical regulation in Europe is the basis for much of the new U.S. legislation. <BR>As yet, we're only seeing the tip of the nutraceutical iceberg. The Chairman of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine, Dr. Stephen DeFelice, estimates that 50% of the $503 billion spent on food products is used for nutraceutical purposes (Genetic Engineering, January 1, 1995, p. 40). The opportunities for nutraceuticals are absolutely unprecedented.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Who Benefits?</H3>The cost of conducting research for nutraceutical products doesn't approach the estimated $300 million expense in bringing a new drug to market, but is nevertheless substantial. In Europe, companies have found that the only reason to seek nutraceutical approval is to protect patent claims. Otherwise, the cost of nutraceutical approval for a food component available to anyone is unrealistically high. <BR>The key to profitability is in proprietary patents. JAMA reports that since nutraceuticals now sell as well as drugs in Europe and since the US market is poised to open, the world's largest pharmaceutical companies are buying every available functional component patent they can get their hands on which meets the criteria of a nutraceutical. A patent does not necessarily guarantee a product's standardization, efficacy, or safety; however, each of those unique substances that can qualify are worth their weight in gold in this new arena.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="/pics/Mole.jpg"><BR><I>A computer representation of Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex.</I></CENTER><H3>Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> Complex- Patented Cornerstone</H3>If carbohydrate technology is medicine's next frontier, then Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex will take man to undreamed of places (see the article in this newspaper on Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex). Developed and patented by Mannatech's scientific team, headed by Dr. Bill McAnalley, Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex is what distinguishes Mannatech products and opportunity from the competition.<BR><BR><BR><H3>The Company</H3>Mannatech is a privately held company founded in 1993 which began operations in early 1994. Among its three primary stock holders is a strong, diverse assortment of skills and experience with which they support their key roles in company management. <BR>Responsibilities for international expansion and corporate finance fall under the direction of the Chairman of the Board, Skip Fioretti. A successful entrepreneur, Skip was the first Outback Steakhouse franchisee outside the state of Florida. When Outback went public in 1992, Skip was offered a substantial buyout for his multiple franchise units. Skip's financial and administrative track record aided Mannatech in securing its original licensing agreement with Carrington Laboratories for its patented aloe vera extract. <BR>Developing the marketing strategy and the compensation program was the responsibility of Mannatech President Sam Caster. Known nationally for his creative marketing concepts, Sam has brought companies in both direct sales and MLM from inception to annual sales exceeding $50 million and $100 million respectively. <BR>Utilizing his years of biotech experience, Bill Fioretti, Chief Science Officer, heads a scientific team that is second to none in carbohydrate technology and new product development. Together, Skip, Sam and Bill comprise the voting Board of Directors who will guide Mannatech as it becomes a major player in the international arena of nutraceutical technology.<BR><BR><BR><H3>The Bottom Line</H3>No one group of products has ever generated the level of enthusiastic endorsements coming from Mannatech's notable consumers. Endorsements from some of the world's top athletes, doctors, researchers, professional sports teams and business people regarding the products' effectiveness are on file. Compound this promotional bonanza with the unlimited potential of Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT>-based products in the nutraceutical market, and you have the opportunity of a lifetime. Many full-time Mannatech Associates are already generating significant incomes. Many more see the potential to position themselves to benefit from the ground level of this enormous opportunity. Mannatech has designed the most comprehensive, flexible, and lucrative compensation plan in network marketing. It provides opportunities to cash in on unlimited width and depth in an organization's sales as well as from the infinity bonuses on training programs. The entire program has been designed to position our part-time Associates for maximum success. Those who wish to go full-time immediately can also benefit from up-front sales commissions on entry packages. Professional network marketers agree; Mannatech has designed the most innovative bonus program in the entire industry. <BR>Yet, the power of the Mannatech opportunity lies in the Associates' ability to harness all the proprietary products' self-selling qualities simply by making a small monthly qualifying purchase. It makes the business simple, the results achievable, step by step. By design, none of the usual distractions, such as tracking group sales, keep Associates from their primary objective: introducing our products' effectiveness and the unlimited opportunity. The figures show that it works. Nowhere else is it possible to find such a substantial financial opportunity for both full- and part-time participants. <BR>By now, one point should be crystal clear: Mannatech is not just another nutritional MLM company trying to compete with a copycat product line. With patented, proprietary cutting-edge products and innovative compensation design, Mannatech has carefully plotted a strategy that could make it the next giant in this industry.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The company moved to secure a proprietary position in the rapidly changing, constantly expanding health care industry with the filing of a new set of composition and use patent claims that belong exclusively to Mannatech. In an industry in which prevention and natural alternatives have become the new national focus, no technology offers more promise than the discovery and use of certain carbohydrates recently recognized as vital in the function and structure of cellular synthesis.An increasing number of scientists believe that certain carbohydrates represent the next frontier in the search for non-toxic treatments of various degenerative conditions. Even though science has only scratched the surface in understanding the full potential of these carbohydrates, the research reported in the last decade alone has generated a new level of hope and cautious optimism for some of the world's leading immunologists. <BR>Until recently, very little was known about carbohydrates other than their ability to provide energy. But recent discoveries of how certain carbohydrates support such critical functions as immune response and cellular communication has triggered enormous growth in the new science of glycobiology. One of the world's most renowned veterinary immunologists, Dr. Ian R. Tizard, wrote "There has long been a tradition in folk medicine that extracts of certain fungi and plants may be of assistance in the treatment of cancer. On investigation, many of these extracts have been found to possess potent immune-stimulating activity. In many cases, this activity is attributable to complex carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are usually large polymers of glucose (glucans and lentinans), mannose (mannans), xylose (hemicelluloses), fructose (levans) or mixtures of these sugars." (Tizard I.R., Carbohydrates, Immune Stimulating. Encyclopedia of Immunology. San Diego 1992.)<BR>The carbohydrates he refers to are long chain sugar molecules called polysaccharides, poly meaning many and saccharides meaning sugar. Even though they're all polysaccharides, not all polysaccharides are created equal. Dr. Tizard continues, "Although common polysaccharides such as starch (alpha-1,4-glucan), dextran (alpha-1,6-glucan) and inulin (fructan) do not have anti-tumor activity, there is abundant evidence that some mannans and glucans are very potent anti-cancer agents."<BR>Motivated by these incredible findings, the world's largest pharmaceutical companies are allocating hundreds of millions of research dollars to develop chemically synthesized carbohydrates. They hope that these synthetics will mimic the effect of their natural counterparts. Synthesizing these carbohydrates will hopefully provide their patentability. The July 1991 (Vol. 9) issue of BIO/TECHNOLOGY states, "New carbohydrate technology will provide novel products for treating diseases, including immune disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. . . . By the year 2000, most biopharmaceutical companies will have demonstrated widespread involvement in carbohydrate product development. Several research and development collaborations-for instance, Monsanto with Oxford Glycosystems and Genetech and Eli Lilly with Glycomed-have already formed. . . But manufacturing, regulation, patents, and drug development uncertainties may mean that many companies will play the waiting game."<BR>Mannatech is at the forefront of this widespread trend in carbohydrate product development, with a couple of important differences. Instead of attempting to develop synthetic carbohydrates as drug companies are doing, Mannatech has developed naturally occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based products. Rather than waiting until a person is sick to provide assistance, Mannatech's products are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to maintain optimal health through improved nutrition.<BR>A large body of the research conducted on naturally-occurring carbohydrates was provided by Dr. Bill McAnalley at Carrington Laboratories through his now world-renowned discovery and stabilization of the mannan-linked carbohydrate in the gel of the aloe vera plant.<BR>So significant was this discovery that Dr. McAnalley was able to obtain 66 worldwide patents for Carrington Laboratories on the composition and use of this unique aloe vera molecule. Over $50 million have been spent on the research and development of the pharmaceutical applications of this discovery. More than 150 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been presented to support these uses, making the aloe molecule the clear frontrunner in carbohydrate technology. <BR>Mannatech's first generation products utilized the patented aloe vera extract Manapol&#174; powder as its proprietary carbohydrate ingredient through an exclusive licensing agreement. As word of these products spread, exponential sales growth facilitated incremental increase in the research budget. When Dr. McAnalley's contract of employment ended with his previous employer, he was encouraged to accept a full-time position with Mannatech. He immediately began examining the body's use of other complex carbohydrates. This led to the discovery of the expanded role that certain polysaccharides play in the body's ability to communicate and revealed the potential benefit of  the nutritional supplementation of these unique polysaccharides in today's diets. This discovery and use is the basis for Dr. McAnalley's newly filed patent claims. <BR>Manapol&#174; powder provided the proprietary technology that helped establish Mannatech as a major player in this new health care environment. Dr. McAnalley's new composition, Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex, which includes the freeze-dried aloe vera extract as a key component, broadens the potential of our exclusive product line. We are now going beyond the potential of any single polysaccharide to build and maintain health. The true genius of this discovery and patent is that Dr. McAnalley has established the need for these eight essential natural carbohydrates from a nutritional basis, eliminating the need to develop a synthetic counterpart for pharmaceutical use. All society benefits from this insight, especially when health maintenance through nutritional supplements cost a fraction of medical expenses. <BR>The article "A Solid Scientific Foundation," by Dr. Bill McAnalley, discusses the scientific basis for these new patent claims and, while none of us can truly estimate the potential of this product in our continuing efforts to solve our health care crisis, its value to Mannatech's marketing efforts is clear. It simply puts us in a league of our own, in control of our own destiny, as Mannatech takes the nutraceutical industry into the next generation of nutritional supplements. For this, each of us owes a true sense of gratitude to the genius of Dr. Bill McAnalley and his staff.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> Complex Patent Inventors:</H3>Bill H.

Reg McDaniel, MD, pathologist. ANMA, the largest association for natural health care practitioners in the U.S., presented a plaque citing work of the research team (also including Eric Moore, DChem and William C. Fioretti, biochemist) for the development of the nutritional carbohydrate complex, Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT>, and the subsequent patent filing on this complex. The selection committee of the ANMA presents this award annually for the most significant progress made in biochemistry.<BR>Dr. McAnalley, in his acceptance response, explained that this patent protects the proprietary combination of the eight naturally derived saccharides used by mammalian cells to synthesize the molecules responsible for cell-to-cell communication. Of the 200+ saccharides occurring in nature, only these eight saccharides are known to be used by the body to synthesize glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids). <BR>Dr. McDaniel stressed that, "The best medical therapy in the world will never be as effective as it could be without the support of good nutrition, which can be enhanced greatly with dietary supplements."

No team in America has more experience in the discovery and utilization of carbohydrates, the organic compounds experts consider to be the next frontier in nutritional science. Harnessing the future of this infant industry can only be done by those with the ability to establish proprietary rights to these new discoveries. It's the arena in which members of Mannatech's scientific team have earned their spurs. They're responsible for the filing and receipt of over 65 patents for Carrington Laboratories worldwide.<BR>Coordinating the team is Mannatech co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, William C. Fioretti, a biochemist with years of experience in product formulation. Bill's work on the standardization and use of plant sterols from the herb Dioscorea created national awareness of the health-building potential of prohormone (DHEA) precursors. That information made Mannatech PLUS and MVP two of the most copied products in the health food industry. <BR>Mannatech was finally able to distance itself from imitators when Bill discovered the enormous potential in combining plant sterols with certain carbohydrates. His work stemmed from discoveries by Bill McAnalley, Ph.D. and medical research by H. Reg McDaniel, M.D. concerning the uniquely structured mannan-linked carbohydrates from the aloe vera plant. Their work, which has generated global recognition, was begun at Carrington Laboratories.The core group of this team which first did research at Carrington Laboratories, including Dr. McDaniel, Dr. McAnalley and Dr. Eric Moore, has been reassembled at Mannatech. Their goal is to look beyond, from the immune-modulating capabilities of various carbohydrates to the unique nutritional value these carbohydrates provide to the body. From this work have come the latest and most significant patent claims: those for the nutritional use of the eight known monosaccharides required in the production of glycoconjugates. Trademarked Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT>, this proprietary carbohydrate complex is the cornerstone of Mannatech products and represents one of the most significant nutraceutical-grade discoveries to date. The American Naturopathic Medical Association recognized that fact with the association's annual award presented in 1996 to Dr. McAnalley and Dr. McDaniel for the most important progress in biochemistry.<BR>These achievements are just the beginning, the team reports. In the hands of this scientific powerhouse, the future is bright indeed. Enhancing this team of standouts are Eileen Vennum, RAC and Bob Ward, PED. Eileen, a Certified Regulatory Affairs Specialist, was brought on board to help Mannatech navigate the minefield of FDA regulations. Eileen's work is critical as the laws pertaining to the use and labeling of dietary supplements continue to evolve. <BR>Providing unique insight into the role nutraceuticals can play in fitness and athletics is Dr. Bob Ward. Conditioning coach and sports scientist for the Dallas Cowboys Football Club for 14 years, Dr. Ward is also the co-author of the Encyclopedia of Biomechanics. His knowledge and experience bring together a unique blend of pure and applied research that draws upon the fields of biomechanics, exercise physiology, information processing, computer prescription technology, martial arts skills and conditioning program technology for application in the emerging field of human performance measurement and assessment.<BR>Clearly, this is a pre-eminent team of experts which makes Mannatech the unquestioned leader in the field of nutraceuticals and positions the company for prominent involvement in the emergent disciplines of prevention and wellness.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

When a cell needs glycoproteins, that part of the DNA is assembled into a message called messenger RNA. It is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the assembly line of the cell - where enzymes are used as factory workers to assemble glycoproteins or other substances. (Stryer, 1995)</I><BR><BR><BR><BR>The Mannatech tradition of innovation and excellence is being further strengthened and enhanced with the introduction of an exciting new dietary supplement available to Associates within the next few months. Unique, the first of its kind, this product's design is based on current scientific knowledge about how the body communicates at the cellular level. <BR>Healthy bodies, comprised of many components working together in sophisticated harmony, must have accurate internal communication to function correctly. In its most basic form, this communication occurs at the cellular level. Molecular biologists refer to it as cell-cell communication. To maintain a healthy body, cells must "talk" to other cells. When the language of the cells is garbled so that the message is no longer clear, health problems occur. <BR>In an article called "Capitalizing on Carbohydrates" in the journal, BIO/TECHNOLOGY, John Hodgson writes, "Almost without exception, whenever two or more living cells interact in a specific way, cell surface carbohydrates will be involved. From the first meeting of sperm and egg, through embryo genesis, development and growth, carbohydrate molecules confer exquisite specificity upon cell-cell interactions."<BR>Any molecule where a sugar (saccharide, glyco) is bound covalently to a moiety (a portion of a functional group of a molecule) of another chemical classification is considered a glycoconjugate, i.e., sugar bound to a lipid forms a glycolipid or to a protein forms a glycoprotein. In other words, nature uses the carbohydrates on glycoconjugates as recognition molecules because they are the most specific form of biological information. These glyco-molecules are collectively known as glycoconjugates. Since more is known about glycoproteins than any other glycoconjugate, let's now look at their structure and function in relation to cell-cell communication.<BR>Scientists have learned that glycoproteins - molecules found on the surface of all cells - play a key role in all cellular communication. The name, glycoprotein, is derived from the molecules' composition: sugar (glyco) and protein. The carbohydrate (sugar) content of glycoprotein molecules is significant, ranging from 1% to over 85% by weight. Most of the proteins that serve multiple functions in the body are glycoproteins.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="/pics/Alpha.jpg"><BR><I>All letters in the English language are made from 4 basic forms. <BR>The body uses 8 monosaccharides to comprise the letters of communication in the body.</I><BR></CENTER><BR><BR>Scientific knowledge concerning the importance of glycoproteins in cell-cell communication is relatively new. Proteins, which are made up of various combinations of amino acids, were originally thought to be the primary communication molecules of the body. What we know as The Biotech Revolution began as an attempt to create new drugs based on proteins. However, the structural simplicity of the protein molecule limits the number of possible configurations it can make in combination with other molecules. The body performs many more functions than those that can be attributed to the molecular configurations possible with proteins. <BR><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="/pics/Asp.jpg"><BR><I><H3>A closeup of the inside of a cell and the assembly line of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER. (Stryer, 1995)</H3></CENTER>Just as words are made from letters of the alphabet, our DNA builds cellular "words" from its own form of "letters" called glycoproteins. Each glycoprotein is produced from certain combinations of these eight monosaccharide substrates (sugars): galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, fucose, N-acteylgalactosamine, N-acetyglucosamine, and xylose (shown here in different colors). This diagram shows the products line of a glycoprotein "letter". Each sugar combination is built and changed by enzymes (the numbers shown between the sugar formations) until the "letter" is complete. If any of these sugars is missing or in short supply, glycoprotein "letters" are not formed or are altered. This can result in non-existent or inappropriate cellular communication experienced as symptoms or disease.</I><BR><BR><BR><BR>Several decades ago a theoretical mathematician, in calculating the number of configurations possible with proteins, found that another "language," yet unknown, had to be responsible for performing most of the communication functions of the body. Today we know that this language is the "language of carbohydrates."<BR>In contrast to the simpler proteins, many more molecular configurations are possible with the more structurally complex carbohydrate molecule, which has two isomeric forms and six binding sites. For example, while only 24 oligopeptide configurations are possible with four peptides (proteins), more than 100,000 different oligosaccharide configurations are possible with four sugars (Stryer et al., Biochemistry, 1995; p 477). So carbohydrates on the surface of cells make many more cellular "words" possible.<BR>Many diseases have altered glycoproteins in common. For example, individuals with collagen diseases have genetically unique glycoproteins. These patients have widespread immunologic and inflammatory alterations of connective tissue.<BR>These illnesses share certain symptoms. Common among them are synovitis, pleuritis, myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, peritonitis, vasculitis, myositis, skin rash, alterations of connective tissues, and nephritis. Laboratory tests may reveal Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, immunoglobulin excesses or deficiencies, antinuclear antibodies (which include antibodies to many nuclear constituents, including DNA and extractable nuclear antigen), rheumatoid factors, cryoglobulins, false-positive serologic tests for syphilis, elevated muscle enzymes, and alterations in serum complement (Tierney et al., 1994; page 681).<BR>Examples of collagen (autoimmune) diseases exhibiting one or more of the above symptoms include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), progressive systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma), polymyositis-dermatomyositis, overlap (or mixed) connective tissue disease, and Sjšgren's syndrome.<BR>Although these autoimmune disorders are regarded as acquired diseases, their causes have not been determined. Genetic factors, however, play a role, since one family often has sequential generations with the same disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is one example of this. Since it's known that these patients have genetically unique collagen glycoproteins, it's immediately obvious that glycoproteins are extremely important to the healthy functioning of the body's structural molecules. Glycoprotein collagens acting as structural molecules illustrate just one of the numerous functions glycoproteins serve in the body. From the preceding list, it is clear that many diseases have altered glycoproteins in common.<BR>What raw materials does the body use to build these important glycoprotein molecules? Ultimately, only plants can capture the sun's energy to produce the carbohydrates (sugars) required by the body. Thus, the plants in our diet are the primary building blocks for the sugar portion of these molecules that are vital to continued good health. The body breaks down plant carbohydrates, restructures them into small sugars, then uses those sugars to build the glycoproteins required for accurate cellular communication and the resultant good health.<BR>Until now the fields of glycobiology and nutrition have never been adequately investigated together. This is true, even in light of 1) the above discussed current scientific knowledge concerning the importance of glycoproteins in cell-cell communication, 2) the importance of sugars in formation of glycoproteins and 3) in spite of the fact that diet is the major source of all carbohydrates (sugars). Although current nutrition textbooks stress the importance of essential vitamins, minerals, proteins (amino acids) and fats in great detail, sugars are currently recognized only as a source of energy (Shils et al., 1994)-not as substances essential to glycoprotein production for good health. <BR>In contrast to the nutrition textbooks, the textbook Harper's Biochemistry (Murray et al., 1996) lists eight monosaccharides commonly found in human glycoproteins which are known to be important to the healthy functioning of the human body. These are: galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and xylose. These eight come from a universe of approximately 200 monosaccharides found in nature. <BR>Of the required eight sugars named in Harper's Biochemistry, only glucose and galactose are addressed in the classic nutrition texts; the other six are omitted. Modern nutrition textbooks give the principal sources of dietary carbohydrates as: 1) maize, rice, wheat, and potato which yield starches composed of glucose; 2) sugar cane and beet sugar which yield glucose; and 3) milk which yields galactose and glucose (Shils et al., 1994). Lactose-intolerant individuals who do not eat dairy products will be deficient even in galactose since the body manufactures galactose from the lactose in dairy products. The remaining six sugars must either be synthesized by the body or obtained from dietary supplements. <BR>While the body uses certain dietary sugars as raw materials to build the glyco- portion of glycoproteins, enzymes are the tools the body uses to build them. Enzymes cause (catalyze) chemical reactions in other substances without being destroyed or altered themselves when the reaction is completed. To function properly, enzymes require adequate supplies of substrate (i.e. raw material). In the case of glycoprotein production, the substrates are the eight sugars mentioned above. Most important: This process does not occur at optimal capacity if adequate supplies of substrate (necessary sugars) are not available (Murray, 1996).<BR>The following equation (Michaelis-Menten Equation), which defines the kinetic properties of most enzymes, demonstrates the importance of consuming adequate amounts of dietary sugars for glycoprotein production:<BR>V=Vmax [S] / [S] + Kmwhere V is the velocity of the reaction; Vmax is maximum velocity; [S] is substrate (sugar), concentration; and KM is the Michaelis constant. This equation means that at high substrate concentrations the rate of the reaction is maximized, i.e. V = Vmax.<BR>Recognizing this, Mannatech has developed supplements to provide the various sugars needed for correctly structured and, therefore, optimally functioning glycoproteins. We have already experienced the results of adding only one of these sugars-mannose-to our diets; so, we are excited about the potential of providing other sugars essential for healthy glycoprotein production. Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex is a mixture of proprietary, standardized natural saccharides. <BR>Mannatech is thrilled to be able to bring this exciting technology to market with the introduction of Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex. This is totally in keeping with Mannatech's continuing mission: To provide cutting-edge proprietary technology to the marketplace. The patent claims which have been filed are focused on protecting Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex from competition for the next 20 years.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In preparation for that day, and to maximize MLM's potential, some companies have tried big royalty payouts, celebrity endorsers, elaborate promotional materials, and even high-pressure pitches to employ distributors and generate revenue. Grand Prairie-based Mannatech Inc. is trying an unusual tactic that perhaps should not be so unusual: letting the product sell itself...After all, MLM is all about word-of-mouth: The message of one distributor motivates another person to go out and become a distributor... fueled solely by the quality and popularity of the product; no one is going to personally tout a product they feel is a dud.<BR>"This is central to why Mannatech decided to market its products through multilevel distributors: they are convinced their products have the level of quality needed to generate a significant buzz in the industryÉ<BR>"'As a physician, I've seen every kind of hype imaginable,' says Maurice Stevens, M.D. and Mannatech distributor. 'I am not stretching the truth when I talk about the amazing results I've seen from the products. In fact, I actually have to restrain myself because it sounds so unbelievable. The bottom line is: these products work.' Leroy Burrell, one-time world record holder in the 100-meter dash and '96 Olympian, credits Mannatech products as a very important part of improving training times and recovery from hard workouts.' Mike Marsh, 1992 Olympic gold-medalist in the 200 meters, says: 'Mannatech's products have improved my workouts, my recovery, and my performance. I believe they will give me the edge I need to bring home the gold again.' Mannatech has a veritable Who's Who list of athletes (none of whom are paid) singing endorsement-like praise. The company also boasts more than 130,000 distributors throughout the U.S. and Canada and $7 million in monthly sales.<BR><BR><B>But why MLM?</B><BR>Mannatech's incredible growth can be credited entirely to multi-level marketing, a method that admittedly makes some people cringe and others falsely suspect the product's credibility. Many still wonder: Can a MLM company be legitimate in the food supplement industry? Is there such a thing?<BR>"'If you would have asked me that question five years ago,' Dr. Bucci says, 'I would have said no. I would have bashed them. But they've really cleaned up their act. Some of the best supplements are sold by multi-level marketing companies. The reason is they educate consumers better than anyone.' Education, of course, is why multi-level marketing is a necessary choice for many companies; their products can have little impact on the market unless the customer has a clear understanding of what they do and how they operate.<BR>Mannatech credits its striking sales performance to properly educating consumers. The education affords Mannatech one other crucial benefit: it helps consumers understand why their products are in a class of their own."Mannatech announced August 9 that it has taken a step in securing a proprietary position in the rapidly changing health care industry with the filing of a new set of patent claims for their recently trademarked complex called Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex."<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Why not? Health is our basic wealth. Staying well is a priority, especially for those who've been ill or injured. With skyrocketing costs and health care provider uncertainty, patients still need the assurance that there are solutions to their health problems. Wellness is a hot media topic. Start with the September 1996 issue of "Texas Business" magazine. When the table of contents declares, "Give this company some respect. Mannatech is moving multilevel marketing and supplements out of the dark ages and into welcoming arms," you can be sure this leading business publication has found a lot to like. It's important to know that "Texas Business" came to Mannatech. Mannatech didn't contact the magazine. The article's author, Joe Grey, was so impressed with the company that he called recently, requesting information for an article slated for another publication.<BR>The November 1996 issue of Veggie Life magazine calls phytochemicals "Nature's Pharmacy." "Phytochemicals," it says, "are the biologically active substances in plants that give them their color, flavor, odor, and protection against plant diseases. During the past few years, scientists have discovered that many of these plant chemicals may also protect the body against disease." There's much more. This article is a mini-education which, at the same time, validates current information available on phytochemicals.Life magazine's September 1996 article, "The Healing Revolution," should be required reading. Here's an excerpt: "It is no secret that during the past few years an increasing number of Americans have been turning to alternative medicineÉ What's news is that their doctors are joining them: A recent survey of family physicians found that more than half regularly prescribe alternative therapy or have tried it themselvesÉ Even the American Medical Association, which two decades ago declared it 'unethical' for its members to associate with chiropractors, grudgingly passed a resolution last year suggesting that its 300,000 members 'become better informed regarding the practices and techniques of alternative or unconventional medicine.'" New wellness information is news!<BR>In 1992 The National Institutes of Health set up an Office of Alternative Medicine, acknowledging the existence of other therapies. Twenty-six modest but groundbreaking grants have been awarded to study such alternative therapies as guided imagery to control asthma and hypnosis to treat back pain.Public Radio recently reported FDA approval of acupuncture needles as medical instruments opening the way for acupuncture as valid therapy. It may soon be one of the alternative therapies insurance companies have begun to cover. The state of Washington became the first in the nation this year when it began requiring insurance reimbursement for treatment performed by any licensed or certified health-care practitioner of massage, acupuncture and approximately 30 other techniques. Various studies suggest that interest in and demand for alternative therapies is at an all-time high.<BR>The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, of Feb. 22, 1995 says, "The growing use of botanicals (products derived from plants) by the U.S. public is forcing moves to evaluate the health claims of these agents and to develop standards of quality and manufacture."<BR>Demand is the key. As people learn more about the less expensive, less invasive, more effective therapies with implications for long-term benefits, they demand them. Other parts of the world are ahead of the U.S. in that regard. In Europe, more herbal remedies are sold than prescription drugs. In the Orient, a variety of alternative therapies has flourished for at least a thousand years. A direct result of such demand is the learning program for health care practitioner at the University of Arizona. Directed by Andrew Weil, M.D., a 1968 graduate of Harvard Medical School, U of A offers M.D.s a two-year postdoctoral program in alternative medicine, a process Weil calls "the integrative medicine movement."<BR>Phytochemicals' perceived health benefits position Mannatech in the forefront of this integrative movement. Mannatech's products, while not intended for use as disease treatments, are designed to support optimal health. Mannatech leads the way in the current trend to take responsibility for ones own health maintenance. Newsweek magazine stated in 1994, "In a world where science merges with health, phytochemicals are the next big thing. Private firms are eyeing them as a health blockbuster."

And although Ray would be the first to say that he didn't do it alone, he is, without a doubt, largely responsible for all of us having the opportunity and the products we all value so much. When the Mannatech product line and network marketing strategy were just concepts in Bill Fioretti's and Sam Caster's minds, Ray saw the beauty in the "diamond in the rough" and, like a master craftsman, went quickly to work to make it all that it should be. Night and day he travelled the country helping us build our businesses and now the diamond beautifully adorns the lives of grateful people throughout this great nation.<BR>Nearly everything Ray has touched in his professional career has prospered. Whether as a commander in a military helicopter unit, the fourth employee of Legg's Pantyhose, the owner of the first 46 Pac Man machines, or any of many other ventures, Ray has an uncanny eye for opportunity and the energy to capitalize on it.<BR>Ray immediately saw the marketing potential of Fioretti's product formulations and labored with Caster to formulate a compensation plan that would benefit the distributors as much financially as the products would their health. Together, they have created what network marketing professionals unanimously agree is the most flexible, lucrative, and comprehensive bonus structure ever to grace the MLM industry-a genuine masterpiece. Ray knew from personal experience that the ideal plan could generate sufficient supplemental revenue to meet the immediate financial needs of the new part-time distributor, or quickly replace the income of the career-minded individual, and ultimately provide opportunity for unlimited wealth for everyone. The true test of a network marketing compensation plan is how quickly, and how many people with varying levels of activity and talent prosper through it. Their formulation worked. Not only did Ray make over one million dollars in less than two years, but we have hundreds of part-timers who substantially supplement their monthly incomes, many others who are making mid-to-high-five-figure monthly incomes, and another group approaching Ray's achievements. In short, the proof of our compensation plan's genius is in the large numbers of others who are fast approaching that "million dollars earned" mark themselves.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

EM&#183;PACT can be described as a high-tech pre-exercise/during exercise supplement that could assist in the body's efficient conversion of fuel into energy.<BR>There is a tremendous amount of information associated with exercise physiology-the scope of which this article does not allow me to cover. However, I will explain some of the body's basic biochemical and physiological processes as it responds to varying levels of exercise intensity. During exercise, the single most important biochemical and physiological event is the supply of energy to the muscles. The basic philosophy behind the EM&#183;PACT product is to assist these biochemical events for the production of energy.<BR><BR><B>Fuels</B><BR>The three basic fuels used during exercise are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Predominantly, the body uses carbohydrates and fats as a source of fuel during exercise. The higher the intensity of exercise, the higher the percentage of carbohydrates used as a source of fuel. Therefore, during long duration, low-intensity exercises, such as walking or jogging long distances, there is a tendency to burn more fat. During high-intensity workouts, such as running at a competitive pace, sprinting, weight lifting, or resistance-type movements, there is a tendency to burn more carbohydrates. The body has a built-in mechanism regulated hormonally that switches the metabolism between these two basic fuels. The conversion of fat into energy has a limit that, when the energy demand exceeds this limit, causes the body to burn either carbohydrates or protein. Protein usually contributes less than 5% of the energy needed during an exercise bout because the body's mechanism is to spare protein and use fuels in the form of carbohydrates and fats instead.<BR>"Getting into shape" or becoming physically fit, basically involves stimulating the enzyme systems that make these biochemical conversions from stored fuel into usable energy. Along with this is an increase in muscle mass to insure that the body can handle the physical demand of exercise. Improving your physical performance level is achieved by continually putting increased demands on the body so that biochemically and physiologically the storage of fuels and the production of energy become as efficient as possible.<BR>The major energy-producing metabolic pathways in the body were some of the original biochemical discoveries, dating back as far as the 1930s and 40s. The body breaks down glucose (the major carbohydrate in its system) through a series of biochemical conversions into a chemical called pyruvate and then into a chemical called Acetyl CoA. This process of breaking down glucose or carbohydrates is called glycolysis. Acetyl CoA is a combination of Coenzyme A (made from the vitamin pantothenic acid, B5) and 2 of the 6 carbon molecules contained in each glucose molecule. (Acetyl CoA can also be formed from the breakdown of fat.) This is the point in energy metabolism at which the basic fuel supplies converge during the aerobic production of energy. Acetyl CoA then goes through the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle), and roughly 38 adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP) molecules per molecule of glucose are generated. ATP molecules fuel the body at rest as well as during all levels of activity.<BR><BR><B>Storage forms of the basic fuels</B><BR>The body's major storage of glucose is in the form of a substance known as glycogen. The body has a very limited storage capacity for glycogen. It is primarily stored in the liver and muscle. Glycogen could be compared to a string of pearls with each pearl being a glucose molecule. It has been estimated that approximately 2 pounds of glycogen can be stored by the average person. That represents about 3,500 calories of energy production. The body's major storage of fat is in the form of substances called triglycerides. These are merely 3 fat molecules connected to a glycerol molecule. In order for fat to be burned as energy, it must first be broken down from triglycerides into free-fatty acids. These free-fatty acids must then enter the mitochondria, described as the powerhouse of the cell because this is where the vast majority of energy production takes place in all cells, including muscle cells. To enter the mitochondria, free-fatty acids need to be combined with a substance known as Carnitine, which serves as the carrier molecule. Once in the mitochondria, the fat molecule is broken down by a process called beta-oxidation to form Acetyl CoA. From here, the process is exactly as we described above for carbohydrates.<BR> The body's ability to store energy in the form of fat is basically unlimited. Any calories that are not used for energy production and basic bodily functions are stored as fat. So in comparison to the energy stored in the form of glycogen, we have an almost unlimited supply of energy in the form of fat. For example, a man in reasonably good condition who weighs approximately 175 pounds with 15% body fat has about 26 pounds of stored fat. That amount of stored fat can produce roughly 110,000 calories (or 30 times the energy stored in the form of carbohydrates). One can easily see why the body prioritizes the use of fat as fuel when the exercise intensity permits fat to be used as fuel.<BR>Obviously, the production of energy is not just associated with exercise, it's essential to life. What we do during exercise is put a demand on our system that requires increased energy production. So how do we optimize this? Mannatech's EM&#183;PACT and some of its other products could help maximize the use of the body's energy supplies in order to accomplish the single most important goal of conditioning: to provide sufficient energy to allow an increase in workout intensity and duration, which over time could lead to improved physical condition.<BR><BR><B>Product Components</B><BR>EM&#183;PACT could help produce these results by providing various biochemical intermediates that are used in the breakdown of both carbohydrates and fats as well as to help accelerate and optimize the use of these stored bodily fuels. EM&#183;PACT is designed to be taken within 15 minutes of the start of an exercise bout. It provides several different components, such as energy in the form of crystalline fructose. Fructose is a carbohydrate that is readily converted to glucose in the system but does not induce the release of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that drives carbohydrates into the cell. If you ingest a large dose of carbohydrates immediately prior to exercise, you can induce a hypoglycemic state called exercise-induced hypoglycemia. That's why the use of candy bars and other such foods have been proven not to be beneficial to the system. Fructose, on the other hand, does not induce an insulin response and provides a readily available source of carbohydrates, which is essential for the body in the initial phases of exercise. Also contained in EM&#183;PACT are medium-chain triglycerides. These are readily broken down by the body to provide a short-chain free-fatty acid that is burned at a high rate of speed, used efficiently by exercising muscles, and helps the system burn fat as fuel. In essence, efficiently used bodily fuels are a basic component of EM&#183;PACT.<BR>The second major group of supplement components in EM&#183;PACT contains some of the biochemical intermediates that could assist in more efficient energy production through the use of stored carbohydrates and fats. These include calcium citrate, magnesium aspartate, magnesium succinate, potassium aspartate, and potassium succinate. These are specific biochemicals used in the TCA cycle, or direct precursors that provide the system with the ability to enhance energy production. EM&#183;PACT also contains Carnitine and lecithin, which could assist in the metabolism of fat that also use the TCA cycle for energy production. In all, EM&#183;PACT provides fuels and metabolic intermediates, that could help in the TCA cycle, as well as choline, magnesium, and potassium aspartate. These aspartates help buffer the cells from lactic acid build-up effects and also convert lactic acid back to pyruvate. Lactic acid is a by-product of anaerobic energy production. It causes muscle soreness after a workout and is the reason why, after sprinting a few hundred yards, you may get a very bad pain in your side or feel tightness in your legs.<BR>EM&#183;PACT is essentially a high-tech mixture of very specific biochemicals and bionutrients that could provide the basis for increased energy production. And of course, to complete the system, we have also added our patented and proprietary substance, Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex. EM&#183;PACT is a tremendous boost in preworkout supplementation that could provide the body with energy and the ability to convert its stored energy for use during sustained exercise. <BR><BR><B>Product Use</B><BR>Now, I would like to spend some time explaining how various Mannatech products can be combined to form an advanced nutritional supplement program for serious athletes as well as general exercise enthusiasts. As we have stated in our literature and training programs, the Mannatech SPORT product is used primarily as a post-exercise supplement. It combines several different bionutrients and phytochemicals, the basis of which is the dioscorea herb (wild yam). Mannatech SPORT could help assist the body in its exercise recovery process. Many physiological and biochemical events occur in the body as a result of exercise. Exercise is the great physiological equalizer because everyone recovers from exercise stress using the same metabolic pathways.<BR>Mannatech SPORT was developed with these metabolic activities in mind. Its basic component, dioscorea, provides important precursors (plant sterols) that the body could use to help support the endocrine system (hormonal system), which orchestrates the recovery process from exercise. Mannatech SPORT also provides additional supplements. Many of you have heard me speak about the importance of dioscorea (among other phytochemicals and medicinal herbs) and how it could help support the body's natural production and balance of hormones. Mannatech SPORT could help enhance the body's natural ability to recover from exercise stress by providing a large selection of plant sterols. This concept is the basis for the formulation of this product. We have taken this philosophy one step further by adding herbs and glandulars that assist in enhancing the anabolic state. The processes of metabolism are two: catabolic processes and anabolic processes. Catabolic means breaking down (such as breaking down glucose into energy), and anabolic means building back up. Mannatech SPORT could help the body in the postexercise rebuilding phase.Numerous testimonials have been received from people stating that their postexercise recoveries have occurred faster and that their next day's exercise routine is much easier. They also feel they have experienced an overall sense of well-being. Many people, athletes or not, report that Mannatech SPORT is the one Mannatech product they like best.<BR>Over the past year, we have gained a great deal of insight and information from people who use our products. This input has greatly assisted us in the formulation of a more advanced nutritional supplement program for athletes and exercise enthusiasts alike. Prior to exercise, using the combination of EM&#183;PACT and Mannatech SPORT might assist in fat breakdown and might increase the availability of fat as a fuel source during exercise. <BR>Specific hormones are known to stimulate an enzyme called carnitine acetyl transferase. Carnitine, one of the components of EM&#183;PACT, could assist in getting fat molecules into the mitochondria in order to be burned as fuel. In that way, the use of the dioscorea product one half hour to an hour prior to workout could possibly set the hormonal condition up so that you get a more efficient burning of fat during your workout. The benefits are twofold. First, if you are exercising as a means of weight management (most of us being more concerned with fat loss than just weight loss), it could promote fat loss. The second benefit is that when the body uses fat during exercise, it conserves carbohydrates. Most of us, and even well-trained athletes, normally have more fat energy stored than carbohydrates. Any time we can make better use of the fat molecules and the energy they contain and spare carbohydrates, we have an ability to extend our exercise routine and/or increase the intensity. <BR>I think what we, as a company, are learning through our experience with these products, particularly in the athletic area, that the use of our dioscorea-containing products in combination with EM&#183;PACT prior to workouts and then Mannatech SPORT following workouts, is a supplemental system that could have a significant effect in improving your exercise routines. I think that this combination is definitely the way for athletes at all levels to get maximum benefits from the use of Mannatech products.<BR>We hope this information has provided you with a better understanding regarding the body's complex energy production system. It is also important to understand that Mannatech products alone do not substitute for the other nutritional components provided by our diets that are essential for life and increased athletic performance. The recent advances in phytochemical discoveries and exercise physiology research have provided Mannatech with the information to formulate products that help to optimize these processes.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

A '70s survey of marathon runners included this question: "If you could take a single magic pill that would guarantee you an Olympic gold medal even though it took several years off your life, would you do it?" A shocking 70% said they would take it, and, there's every indication that the problem is getting worse.<BR>In the past five years, more swimmers have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs than in the previous two decades. These facts have created great interest among responsible coaches and trainers to examine more closely the potential of certain plant substances that have been shown scientifically to support the body's normal exercise physiology. The following test was conducted for that reason.<BR><BR><BR><H2>The Efficacy of Mannatech Products in Competitive Swimming</H2><H3>Purpose</H3>The purpose of the study was to determine the measurable benefits of Mannatech products on swimmers after 12 weeks of intensive training. <BR><BR><BR><H3>Research Team</H3>Bill Jewell, Head Swim Coach, with his assistants, Ken Hamdorf, Steve Bentley, Study Director, and Bob Ward, Research Consultant with Mannatech, contributed to the implementation of the study. Study Director, Steve Bentley, compiled and analyzed the swimming data.<BR><BR><BR><H3>Golden West Swimming Program - <BR>Background/History</H3>Golden West College's swim record is superlative. Behind every good program, however, is outstanding leadership. That's just what Head Swim Coach, Bill Jewell, provides. Bill will be the first to tell you that being successful requires the right mix of talent, coaching, scientific training programs, and of course, the good luck generated by hard work. <BR>For some teams, winning one state meet would be enough to validate the program's efficacy. However, Golden West College has gone significantly beyond that achievement, exceeding the laws of probability for winning over the last 25 years. Golden West teams have been Conference Champions 22 out of the last 25 years; California State Champions in 1985, '86, '90 and '95. Golden West teams were runners-up in 1983, '91, '92 and '94. It would be safe to say that men's swimming and water polo are strongly emphasized at Golden West College. The 17-member swim team has swimmers from California, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Hawaii, Mexico, Sweden and Switzerland, an indication that the program's reputation extends far beyond the California border.<BR><BR><BR><H4>Objectives:</H4>Does the use of Mannatech products:<BR>A. Enhance performance<BR>B. Improve endurance<BR><BR><BR><H4>Subjects:</H4>17 male swimmers were eligible for the study, ranging from 18 to 21 years of age. All of the swimmers had trained intensely for the 12 weeks prior to the study and were in peak condition.<BR><BR><BR><H4>Groups:</H4>All 17 swimmers were given the option of taking the Mannatech products. 12 swimmers opted to try the products. Five opted not to try them. That presented the opportunity to break the team into two groups. The Test Group consisted of 12 swimmers: four Distance Swimmers, three Middle Distance Swimmers, five Sprinters. The Control Group of five swimmers included one Distance Swimmer and four Middle Distance Swimmers.<BR><BR><BR><H4>Length of Study:</H4>The study was 22 days in length, starting on April 13, 1996, and concluding May 4, 1996. It included the most important meets on the swim team calendar: The Golden West Invitational, April 13; The Conference Champion-ships, April 26-27; The State Champion-ship Meet, May 2-4.<BR><BR><BR><H4>Training During the Study:</H4>All swimmers trained the same amount of time per week. Intensity of the training sessions were varied according to the events swum. Training sessions included one hour swimming, a.m., five days per week; two hours swimming, p.m. six days per week; one hour of weights three days per week.<BR><BR><BR><H4>Mannatech Products Used:</H4>The following Mannatech products were used each day:<BR>1).

Meet Personal Trainer, Mark Madole! Degreed in Exercise Science with certification as a Personal Trainer, Weight Room Instructor and in PTR Biomechanics, Mark is co-owner of The Studio, a Dallas personal training facility. A sponsored Nike Fitness Athlete, he is a member of Nike's Personal Training Elite Team of lecturers and researchers. Voted one of the "Top ten Personal Trainers in Dallas," Mark is a distinctive addition to the Mannatech Team.<BR>Adding Mark to our team wasn't easy. His reputation as a fitness consultant attracts hundreds of companies selling nutritional products who want his endorsement. Before Mannatech approached him, he'd found nothing out of the ordinary. <BR>As he read Mannatech literature and listened to the tapes, he discovered that these products are different; they're based on science, not hype. "Mannatech not only said their products were the best; they proved it," Mark said. "For me, network marketing was the only drawback. Eventually, I realized that marketing products one-on-one is necessary so that people can appreciate the value of these products."<BR>Mark selected Mannatech for several reasons: "First, thorough research," he said. "Any type of supporting research I've ever requested, I've received. Every one of my questions has been answered. Mannatech has scientific evidence that people are seeing positive life-style changes through these products. Second, integrity," Mark continued. "The research team is a highly respected group. I've found that in no other MLM company. McAnalley, McDaniel and Fioretti are all accomplished scientists, but they don't hoard their knowledge. They use it to help all people understand why the products are so beneficial.<BR>"Most important," Mark emphasized, "the products work! When you take them on a continuous basis, you get positive results. In my line of work, that generates enthusiasm. When people feel better, they start making better choices about what they put in their bodies, and this helps them reach their goals faster. The fact that Mannatech products are natural makes them even more attractive to my clients. I believe Mannatech products are the best that have entered the fitness industry in years.

Butch Johnson, Bob Lilly, and Randy White were "great" athletes who made a tremendous contribution to football, and it was exciting to be working with them on another playing field where they could apply their unique talents toward accomplishing a different goal. Mannatech provides the opportunity for them and me to create big plays for ourselves as well as others in the areas of health and wealth. <BR>The exposure of network marketing has enabled Mannatech's products to make a difference to athletes from a variety of sports arenas. I have had the privilege of meeting and working with a broad spectrum of male and female athletes of all ages, experience and ability. From the testimonials I receive daily, it is becoming obvious to me that these products are beneficial to people participating in a variety of sports. Since the components in these products are not found in a normal diet, they may be able to impact performance in a way that no other product could.<BR>Professional athletes are continually bombarded with opportunities to endorse a multitude of products with the promise that using the product will enhance their performance. So, it is very interesting that the athletes quoted on this page are not paid to endorse Mannatech's products. Through personal experience, they have recognized the value of these products, and they want to share them with as many people as possible. Their testimonials bear witness to the incredible potential of these products and their athletic achievements read like a who's who in athletic performance. Testimonials from some of the world's greatest athletes, coaches, and trainers as well as documented clinical tests results, have convinced me that Mannatech sport products are the best natural, nutritional non-toxic alternative to steroids and other dangerous performance enhancing drugs.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><I>Reproduction of athlete and celebrity endorsements is strictly prohibited.</I></CENTER><H2>Professional Sports Coaches and Trainers</H2><IMG SRC="/pics/harg.jpg"><BR><BR><B>Mike Hargrove</B><BR>Manager, Cleveland Indians<BR><BR><BR><B>Rick Griffin</B><BR>Trainer, Seattle Mariners<BR><BR><BR><B>John D.

And that's not an isolated opinion. In professional basketball, a game dominated by men, there is one dominant woman: Nancy Lieberman-Cline. She's a model for women of every age in sports, sports broadcasting, business, motivational speaking and civic involvement. She's also put together an enviable string of honors:<BR><BR><UL><LI>1996 inductee into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.<BR><LI>First woman inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame.<BR><LI>First woman to play in a men's professional basketball league: Springfield Fame, U.S. Basketball League.<BR><LI>First woman to play with the Harlem Globetrotter World Tour: Washington Generals, 1988.<BR><LI>#1 Draft choice of the Women's Basketball League in 1980, of the Women's American Basketball Association in 1984.<BR></UL>A standout at Virginia's Old Dominion University, Nancy led the school to two consecutive national championships and was twice selected National Player of the Year. She won a gold medal in the 1975 Pan American Games, a silver medal in the 1976 Olympic Games and was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Team which did not compete in the games due to the U.S. boycott.<BR>Any girl who's wanted to compete with the boys can envy Nancy. She's appeared in the Utah Jazz Summer League and in Spud Webb's All-Star Game where she competed with such high-profile guys as Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas and has gone one-on-one with Michael Johnson.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="/pics/NanHF.jpg"><BR><BR><I>1996 NBA Hall of Fame inductees from left to right: <BR>George Gervin, Gail Goodrich, Nancy Lieberman-Cline, David Thompson, George Yardley</I><BR><BR><BR></CENTER>Her talents extend well beyond the basketball court. Nancy is recognized as the driving force behind Martina Navratilova's rise to the pinnacle of women's tennis. As Martina's conditioning coach, Nancy developed strategies and methods that revolutionized the way women train. She was the first female named to President Reagan's "Sports Drug Awareness Program." As a part of Governor Mario Cuomo's Anti-Drug Student Leadership Program, Nancy has helped educate youngsters about the hazards of drug and alcohol use.<BR><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/pics/NanF.jpg">She's an accomplished broadcaster, a popular keynote speaker whose regular audiences include members of the Fortune 500, the owner of a sports marketing company: Events Marketing Inc., and she also conducts basketball camps for several weeks each year. She serves on the boards of the Women's Sports Foundation, and Nebraska Sports Magazine, also contributing time and effort to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Special Olympics, and Boys' and Girls' clubs, among others. On top of all this, she relishes her role as the wife of Tim Cline and mother of two-year-old Timothy Joseph Cline Jr., called TJ. Whew! The traveling squad and the Terrible Two's?<BR>How does she do it? She's sneaking up on age 40, but it's not at all apparent. In fact, Nancy could have originated the "I'm not getting older, I'm getting better" phrase. Last spring, a reporter for the "L.A. Times" asked Nancy how she expected to keep up with the young women in their twenties who would be her Women's NBA teammates and opponents next year. "At the time," Nancy says, "I acknowledged that I probably wouldn't have the endurance to play more than half a game, 18 - 20 minutes, of quality basketball. Since I've been taking the Mannatech products, I've found that I'm able to play a full 40 minutes of high-quality ball. I talked to the same reporter recently and told him that I was retracting that estimate and I told him why. Do you know what he said? He said, 'I'm shocked!' I had to laugh. I'm shocked, too! This is totally unexpected." When her teammates quiz Nancy about her surprising endurance and lack of muscle soreness, she shares information on Mannatech products with them, especially EM&#183;PACT and SPORT. Nancy says, "The older you get, the more you need an edge. Mannatech products give me that edge. This is an arena where every percentage point of difference counts. When something can give you even a 1% edge - and I know I gain much more than that - it makes the difference between being just a good player and being a star. Mannatech makes the difference. I love this company!"<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><I>Reproduction of athlete and celebrity endorsements is strictly prohibited.<BR>Athletic performance was achieved through the combination of exercise, <BR>good diet and nutritional supplementation.

Probably the most extraordinary of these athletes is Tony Volpentest.Tony is classified as the fastest amputee athlete in the world. In the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona, he won two gold medals and set world records in the 100 and 200 meter races. He is also the U.S. record holder for the 100 and 200 meter races. He was the Everett Herald Man of the Year in Sports in 1991. He was "Sports Illustrated" Athlete of the Month and first runner-up for Athlete of the Year in 1993, and received the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Award for the Physically Challenged for 1994.<BR>The youngest of six children, Tony was born without wrists, ankles, hands or feet. His legs and arms were only partially formed. That made no difference to his family who always encouraged him to be as active as other children. He grew up with the idea that he could do anything, and his accomplishments prove him right. Running on specially designed spring-release prostheses, Tony has achieved speeds that are impressive by any standards.<BR>In 1995, Tony was introduced to Mannatech products. After being on the products for just three weeks, he stated, "My workouts now are absolutely phenomenal! Every day I go to training thinking there is no way I can top what I did yesterday, but when I leave at 4:30, I tell my coach I had another great workout." Tony said he especially likes SPORT and PLUS because he believes the products help him recover quickly from his intense workouts.<BR><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/pics/TV3.jpg">In Barcelona in 1992, Tony set the previous world's record in the 100 meters: 11.63 seconds, a time he thought unbeatable. At the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, after having trained for the last year on SPORT and PLUS, Tony set a new world record of 11.36 in the 100 meters and won another gold in the 200 with a time of 23.28. Tony says emphatically, "I feel that these products definitely give me an edge on my competition. Mannatech is great." <BR>Now that the games are over, Tony has determined his next goal. "I plan on building my Mannatech business and sharing these great products with people everywhere," he said. "I couldn't be more excited about my future with Mannatech." When he speaks at a Mannatech event, Tony always attracts large audiences. This young man is a remarkable athlete and an even more outstanding, inspirational role model for people of all ages.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><I>Reproduction of athlete and celebrity endorsements is strictly prohibited.<BR>Athletic performance was achieved through the combination of exercise, <BR>good diet and nutritional supplementation.

But what separates Mannatech products from the tens of thousands of other nutritional products? <BR>Mannatech is at the forefront of a widespread trend in research and development of carbohydrate-based products. However, rather than attempting to develop synthetic carbohydrates as drug companies are doing, Mannatech has developed naturally occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based products. Rather than waiting until a person is sick to provide assistance, Mannatech's products are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to maintain optimal health through improved nutrition.<BR>Mannatech has filed a patent on the supplementation of eight specific monosaccharides used by the body in synthesis of glycoconjugates-cell-surface molecules that are important in cell-cell communication. Scientists are just beginning to identify the importance of this communication in supporting all functions of the body. <BR>Mannatech has been preparing for this unprecedented opportunity by scientifically testing and standardizing the functional components in other plants as well. The following segments will cover some of these beneficial plants used in the formulation of Mannatech's patent-protected products.<BR><BR><B>Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT></B><BR>The foundation of all Mannatech products is centered around the use of Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex. Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> describes Mannatech's new product line, which we believe contains the most important phytochemical discovery to date. This patent-protected complex is utilized as a stand-alone dietary support product, as a key ingredient in combination with other beneficial food components, and as the primary component in a unique line of skin care products. Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> products are designed to help provide eight known monosaccharides used in glycoconjugate synthesis. Manapol&#174; powder helped provide one of these eight sugars.<BR>"Almost without exception whenever two or more living cells interact in a specific way, cell surface carbohydrates will be involved. From the first meeting of sperm and egg, through enbryogenesis, development and growth, carbohydrate molecules confer exquisite specificity upon cell-cell interactions. Complex carbohydrates are essential in the correct functioning of the body's immune defenses. . ." (Hodgson J. "Capitalizing on Carbohydrates". Biotechnology. 1991; 8:109).<BR><BR><B>The Precursors of Dioscorea</B><BR>There are more than 600 species of the botanical dioscorea. Certain species of the herb have been used anecdotally for centuries for relief of chronic conditions, as a fat-controlling agent, and as a lean tissue builder. Researchers believe the reason for these benefits is that these dioscorea species are storehouses of phytochemicals called plant sterols. Not found in our daily diets, these plant sterols may help support the body's natural production and balance of hormones. As hormones help regulate all metabolic processes, these functional food components could provide invaluable benefits in building and sustaining healthy bodies. Mannatech uses processing methods that provide a dioscorea complex with standardized levels of these plant sterols that, when combined with Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex, could provide effective building blocks not obtainable in any other products.<BR><BR><B>Beyond Vitamins</B><BR>For years, companies have formulated vitamins, minerals and enzyme supplements for nutritional support. As controversy builds regarding the actual benefits of these supplements, scientists have found common ground in the exciting potential of phytochemicals. New processing techniques allow manufacturers to emulsify, dehydrate and freeze-dry raw fruits and vegetables. These techniques protect the essential components of the whole food, including the valuable phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals and enzymes, and provide them to the consumer in an effective and convenient manner.<BR>Mannatech is truly on the cutting edge in nutraceutical technology and is the clear frontrunner in the race to capture market share in this explosive new industry.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Our internal systems have strengths and weaknesses dictated by our own special genetic codes just as our physical characteristics have strong and weak features imposed by our genes. We can see physical differences on the outside. Behavioral differences show us the genetic uniqueness on the inside. <BR>That's why Mannatech's Metabolically Formulated Nutritional Supplements make so much sense. They're designed to optimize any weak elements in a person's system while supporting and enhancing the strengths. Whether you're a Profile 1, 2 or 3-as revealed through your self-testing metabolic profile-your health can benefit from the dietary recommendations and the specific formulation for your metabolic type.<BR>Time for a little high school biology review: Most of us have a general idea of what metabolism is and does; few of us remember precisely what's involved. (Try to act like you knew all this, and you're just going over it for review!) Here goes:<BR>Metabolism is the name for the chemical and physical processes going on continuously in all living organisms and cells. Metabolism has two parts: Anabolism: the process in which assimilated food is built up into protoplasm (the essential living matter of all animal and plant cells), and Catabolism: the process in which protoplasm is used and broken down into simpler substances or waste matter, at the same time releasing energy for all vital processes (breathing, thinking, digesting, moving-insignificant stuff like that).<BR>Why are we torturing you with this? So that you can appreciate the fact that metabolism 1). is a critical function, uniquely different in each individual, and that 2). it requires specific nutritional elements in specific amounts to get the maximum value from the process. <BR>If you don't have enough of one element, or have too much of another, it will alter your metabolic processes. Because we're biochemically unique, it's obvious that one diet won't work for everyone. Each of us has different requirements and needs. <BR><BR><B>Biochemical Individuality</B><BR>Biochemical individuality is not NEW news. In the first century B.C., the Roman philosopher, Lucretius commented, "One man's meat is another man's poison." By 1919, Dr. Frances Pottenger was examining metabolic individuality. In the 1950s, Drs. Melvin Page and Henry Bieler concurrently developed concepts of "endocrine types" and their relationship to various foods. In the same time frame, Dr. George Watson described Fast and Slow Oxidizers and their characteristics.<BR>Dr. Roger Williams, the University of Texas's noted biochemical researcher and the first biochemist to be elected president of the American Chemical Society, originated the genetotrophic theory which suggests that every human being has distinct nutritional needs. He wrote, "That malnutrition--unbalanced or inadequate nutrition-at the cellular level should be thought of as a major cause of human disease seems crystal clear to me. It is the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from the facts produced by decades of biochemical research."<BR>In other words, philosophers and scientists have noted differences in behavior and performance created by nutrition for more than 2,000 years. It's just been in the last 25 years, however, that strategies to meet individual biochemical needs have finally begun to emerge. <BR>In the early '80s, Dr. William D. Kelley developed a computerized system of metabolic profiling. The database was compiled from 10,000 patients with degenerative diseases and focused first on the autonomic nervous system alone. This program was later expanded to include the other major energy-producing system in the body, the Oxidative System. This is an overview of how these systems work:<BR><BR><UL><LI><B>The Autonomic Nervous System:</B> Divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic, it controls the motor functions of heart, lungs, intestines, glands and other internal organs, and of the smooth muscles, the blood vessels, and the lymph vessels.<BR><LI><B>The Oxidative System:</B> The process inside the cells in which oxygen and substrates interact, producing energy and water.<BR></UL>These two systems are the focus of Mannatech's Metabolic Profiling. By design, best results are obtained from combining dietary recommendations for your metabolic profile with nutritional supplements designed specifically for your metabolic profile group. If you want to know even more, refer to the Mannatech brochure on Metabolic Profiling for complete information.

That profile will pinpoint the specific nutritional formula needed to give his/her body the critical elements it must have for maximum health and energy production. The next step is to supply the body with those raw materials, the vitamins and minerals, that it can utilize most effectively. Mannatech believes these can best be found in food matrix formulations because the food matrix formulation offers the most bioavailable nutrients obtainable.<BR><BR><B>What's Wrong with Ordinary Vitamin/Mineral Supplements?</B><BR>Contrary to what vitamin companies would like you to believe, the truth is that the vitamins and minerals in supplements are not the same as the vitamins and minerals in food. In fact, they can't be found in any food on this planet! In vitamin supplements, even the so-called "natural" ones, the ingredients are what is known as USP, United States Pharmacopoeia, vitamins. Very simply, that means that these vitamins are isolated pharmaceutical chemicals. And the minerals? The minerals are mined from the ground!<BR><BR><B>VITAMINS: Supplements vs Food</B><BR>As an example, Vit. B-6 in supplements is pyridoxine hydrochloride, a synthetic USP chemical. This is nothing like the Vit. B-6 in food. Pyridoxine hydrochloride isn't found in any food. The only vitamins that are found in food are contained in a highly complex form we call the food matrix. This food matrix contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, bioflavonoids and other food factors. Our bodies recognize and utilize these vitamins most easily in food matrix form.<BR><BR><B>MINERALS: Supplements vs Food</B><BR>All minerals originally come from the ground. Much of our food also grows in the ground. Minerals in the soil enter plants through the roots and are assimilated inside the plant cells into complex structures which our bodies can use. They become part of the living plant tissue, part of the food matrix. That's why the iron in broccoli doesn't look like the iron in your car. One is a metal mined from the ground and the other is contained in living food tissue. In those supplements that utilize USP minerals, the minerals are not food; they are rocks and metals mined from the ground.<BR>Let's examine calcium supplements. With a little training, you can learn to read container labels and translate some of the chemical names into everyday language. What's called calcium carbonate on the label is really limestone. Calcium sulfate is plaster. Calcium phosphate is chalk. Often these are reacted with chemicals. As one example: calcium citrate, lactate and ascorbate are limestone reacted with acids. Other forms of calcium that are not naturally occurring include amino acid chelates, colloidal minerals and hydroxyapatite.<BR><BR><B>Check the labels.</B><BR>Think about this: If we could assimilate rocks and metals from the ground, we wouldn't need to grow food. We could gain the necessary nutrients just by eating the soil. That's a ridiculous proposal, of course, because we all know that our bodies weren't designed to be nourished by rocks. No civilization in history has managed to exist on a diet of rocks, shells or bones, yet, that's what you get in USP supplements. How much ground rock do you think your body can assimilate? Not much! Nonetheless, your body will make a heroic effort. It does its best to make the mineral into complex molecules that it can use, excreting what it can't use. And, although the supplements provide such limited nutritional value, mega-dosing is not an option, since mega-doses can cause side effects.In looking for alternatives, some people have considered using colloidal minerals, minerals suspended in their own salts. These salts are very sensitive to pH, and as a result, can be broken down easily by the acid/alkaline present in the stomach. Where these might provide a higher level of absorption than the simple mineral, they are not in food matrix form, and as such don't compare favorably.<BR><BR><B>What About the So-Called "Food-Based" Vitamin/Mineral Supplements?</B><BR>"Natural" or "food-based" supplements are formulated with the same USP chemical vitamins and minerals we've mentioned before. Formulators simply put them into a big blender with small amounts of powdered foods and mix the two together. Products created by this method are then sold as "natural" or "food-based" powders, tablets or liquids. The problem with this approach is that the USP vitamins and minerals are unchanged. They are still not recognizable to your body. Your mind may be fooled by a little powdered food mixed with rocks and chemicals, but the cells of your body won't be.<BR><BR><B>The Best Answer: Food Matrix Vitamins and Minerals </B><BR>The closer a substance is to the elements of which the body is made, the more affinity the body has for the substance, the more recognizable the substance is to the body. That's why phrases such as "natural" and "food-based" have so much appeal, because they convey the idea that these substances are easy to absorb and use. That isn't the fact; it was the image that was conveyed. In fact, until recently, there were no acceptable options.<BR>People continue to look for high-quality supplements that perform as promised, but their efforts have largely been frustrated. Although scientists have researched all the right sources, the fruits and vegetables that promise so much, they've found it almost impossible to create a formula that provided enough of any of the necessary nutrients. <BR>They've investigated the cutting-edge "super" foods such as spirulina, blue-green algae, chlorella, bee pollen and nutritional yeast, but found that even these high-powered concentrates offered only minimal amounts of the desired nutrients. And even though it sounds like a good idea, eating large amounts of any of these substances to gain the potential benefits simply creates a more unbalanced system.<BR>Vitamin and mineral formulators had almost reached a stalemate before researchers developed processes which would convert USP vitamins and minerals into usable form through a food matrix. Although the processes are proprietary, most follow a format similar to this: Vitamins are combined, one-on-one, with biologically active concentrates of particular foods. This allows a reaction to occur, the result of which is a food matrix. Converting minerals and Vit. D to natural form is accomplished by feeding them to growing one-celled plants such as baker's yeast after which enzymes are added. Obviously there's more to both processes, but these are the basics.<BR>Obtaining vitamins and minerals in a food matrix enables your body to get more nourishment than ever before possible with no danger of toxicity. Studies have shown that this formulation may be better absorbed, utilized and retained than isolated USP forms. Better yet, vitamins and minerals in a food matrix rarely cause the nausea sometimes associated with ordinary vitamins.<BR><BR><B>Do You Need Food Matrix Vitamins and Minerals?</B><BR>None of us is eating an ideal diet unless we've already moved to the pollution-free hilltop of our dreams. The rest of us don't seem to have access to three perfectly balanced, properly prepared meals of natural foods each day. Long work hours, stress, polluted air, water and food affect our intake. That's why we need to be sure our supplements are providing everything we need. And that's also why the properly formulated ingredients in Profiles 1, 2 and 3 are so vital to our well-being.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

His specialty is the chemical and genetic basis for behavior. In his search for natural answers to chemical problems in the brain, he's become an enthusiastic proponent of Mannatech products.<BR>A holistic practitioner, he considers the whole person: body, mind and spirit. "My doctorate in neurochemistry and extensive training in biochemistry, naturopathy and biological anthropology" he says, "provide me with the knowledge to evaluate each patient as a whole person, not just as a broken arm or arthritic knee."<BR>Dr. Nugent tests nutritional products-more than 6,000 products in the last ten years. With his reputation as a man whose judgment can't be bought, it's important to note that Mannatech is the first network marketing company whose products Dr. Nugent has recommended.<BR>A Mannatech Associate, first rebuffed by Dr. Nugent, made a medical appointment to see him. "I was upset when I realized he wasn't a patient, that he came in to sell me something," Dr. Nugent says. "Little did I know that he had brought me products that I had been looking for my entire professional career. I gave him a hard time. As a research scientist, I wanted to deal in facts only."He returned, armed with information. I found that the company, the products and the leaders have exceptional credentials! Mannatech is not like the others, making claims without the evidence to support them.<BR>After a thorough analysis of the company, Dr. Nugent decided to try the Mannatech products. He now believes that among the things which set Mannatech apart are the company's dedication to research and to utilizing phytochemicals. "I teach my students to treat each patient as absolutely biochemically unique, because that is truly the case. It's pretty exciting to find all of the ideas and principles I've taught for years, concentrated in Mannatech. "It comes down to my philosophy: Never compromise. I think the health care potential in these products is beyond calculation."<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The difference in how people treat them, however, is not at all subtle. Our opportunity has already proven to be as good as gold to those who have the proper tools, training, work ethic, attitude and business plan in place. I have found that success in Mannatech is really not as much about talent as it is common sense. Some people simply treat this business like a business-not a game or a hobby-a business. These business types seem to go so much faster than the rest. Personally, I had to decide why I was involved-to have another hobby or to get wealthy. Once I was sure I wanted wealth and stopped tinkering, my organization absolutely exploded. The quick growth almost seemed too easy. The difference was all in how I perceived and treated my opportunity.<BR><BR>Chris Parker, a close friend from Cleveland and one of my best trainers, said to me, "David, it seems there are three kinds of people who get into Mannatech: those who get in only to buy the products at wholesale, those who treat Mannatech like a hobby, and those who understand the true potential of the opportunity and run their businesses like the multi-million-dollar money-maker it really is. Only the latter see their businesses take off and prosper." <BR><BR>Bullseye! From my vantage point as former Mannatech Vice President Marketing and Communications and now as a full-time Associate, I couldn't agree more. I especially like the difference Chris distinguishes between the hobbiest and business person. It identifies that "certain something" that separates those who get wealthy and those who only watch others get that way. First, let me say there are many legitimate strategies for building a successful Mannatech organization. However, after Sam Caster checked the computers and delved deep into business-building strategy, he discovered that the quickest way to build a lucrative business is by enrolling people through the All-Star Business Pack and concentrating on the Corporate Training Bonuses. Here are only four reasons why:<BR><BR><B>Reason 1.</B><BR>If you sign up with the $1000 All-Star Business Pack (ASBP), it only takes enrolling five other ASBPs to get your investment back, whereas if you sign up as a Master Associate (MA) for $229, it takes ten MA enrollees to fully recoup your investment. The ASBP approach is 200% more effective at returning the initial capital investment. If someone is tight on money, help them go for ASBP sign-ups and get them their investment capital with only five sponsored instead of ten.<BR><BR><B>Reason 2.</B><BR>It only takes enrolling five ASBPs to make $1,000, whereas it takes 40 MAs or 100 $49 enrollees to make $1,000. The ASBP approach is 800% faster than the MA approach and 10,000% faster than the "Consumer Associate" ($49 enrollment) approach in helping people make substantial amounts of money quickly. Remember, it's not just how much is made, but how quickly the Associate makes it that determines how soon an Associate is able to make Mannatech a full-time business. <BR><BR><B>Reason 3.</B><BR>If someone enrolls at the Consumer Associate (CA) level or MA level and their business really takes off (maybe several ASBP sign-ups or a lot of volume), they will lose all binary volume that would have been placed in all the other income centers because they did not have the personal wholesale volume necessary ($600) to qualify all their income centers. The CA and MA enrollees only have their number one income center qualified. If it takes them two to three months (or more) to qualify all their income centers, it could feasibly cost them much more than the initial investment difference between the CA or MA levels and the ASBP. In reality, it could cost them thousands of dollars. The ASBP approach is the most practical enrollment approach for those who are serious about making all the money they work for.<BR><BR><B>Reason 4.</B><BR>If someone enrolls at the CA level and others in their organization enroll through the ASBP, they won't get credit for them in their training bonuses, which could cost them a tremendous amount of money. Don't let anybody in your organization enroll for training before you or you will lose out on the most lucrative revenue stream in our compensation plan.If you want to attract business professionals into your organization, you are going to have to show them, in real terms, how to replace their current income very quickly. These types are very busy and don't generally have one to three years to "play" at making money. If you don't present a plan that helps them generate immediate and sizable income, you could soon lose them. Showing only income from the ASBP approach five-wide and four levels deep* will stimulate the entrepreneurial blood of just about any serious business or corporate person. If showing an annual income of $100,000 doesn't stir them because it is too small, just take the plan a couple of levels deeper to reflect the Leadership bonuses which will take them into a seven-figure income. Warning: don't show the high numbers too soon with people who have never made a six-figure income. Although the incomes are very real, it usually goes way beyond that which is believable. <BR>In a few years, several Mannatech Associates will be earning mid-seven-figure incomes. By building your business with All-Star Business Packs, maybe you'll be one of them. "There's gold in them there pills!"<BR>For a full explanation of the which pack might be the perfect fit for you, call Visua.com toll-free at 888.478.2266 to get a copy of David Colister's audio cassette, "Where Do I Go From Here?" If you're already convinced that a career with Mannatech is best for you and wish to maximize your business-building potential, order a copy of David's two-tape, advanced training audio set entitled, "Selling the $1,000 Pack."<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

This new industry called nutraceuticals is predicted to be the next financial blockbuster in this country. <BR>Fact: Mannatech owns the exclusive rights to Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex, a major breakthrough in nutritional science and the first product with glyco-nutritional patent claims. <BR>So, this is not a game, not a hobby, nor a fleeting obsession for either the owners of Mannatech or for its growing number of business-minded Associates. Mannatech has at-tracted some of the world's best athletes, top health care professionals, and brightest marketing professionals for one reason - advanced technology. Once an individual experiences Mannatech products, they become a committed consumer. Once they learn about the technology behind the products, the future of nutraceuticals, and the financial opportunity associated with becoming a Mannatech Associate, they become committed business- builders. So, how does Mannatech plan to educate the multitudes? Through an aggressive two-stage training program. <BR>Stage one is called Master Associate Training. This training package includes Mannatech products (retail value exceeds the cost of the pack), a professional training and working manual, and live training on the company, products, marketing compensation, and an initial daily business plan for success. This training package is designed to teach the basic facts about the business and business-building skills as well as provide the materials needed to insure success for the part-time or full-time Associate. <BR>The next stage of training is the more comprehensive All-Star Training. This training package includes Mannatech products (retail value exceeds the cost of the package), professional training and working manual insert, and live training from company founders, researchers, doctors, and patent holders as well as top-producing Mannatech Associates. This training is designed to solidify the long-term potential of this opportunity through first-hand exposure to individuals who have discovered and patented the technology, formulated the products, developed the marketing strategies, and designed the operating systems. In addition, top producers are invited to train the advanced business-building techniques that have proven to get results.<BR>Mannatech has all the ingredients necessary to provide Associates with an unlimited financial opportunity. The company is well-financed, and owns the exclusive rights to Ambrotose<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT> complex. The management team is seasoned, experienced, and has operated together for two years. The scientific team is unmatched in the development of carbohydrate-based nutraceuticals. Clinical data supports the effectiveness of the products. The only variable would be the level of commitment that each new Associate makes to this business. If you treat this business like a hobby, it will pay you likewise. If, however, you can truly grasp the significance of the opportunity that Mannatech provides, then make the commitment to be trained to succeed, it's a commitment that could change your life forever.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

I was committed from the very beginning. I was ready to allow it to happen. In fact, I didn't find Mannatech; Mannatech found me!"--Marion CulhaneThere is no doubt about it. Marion Culhane is one calm, confident and focused woman, but she's not at all self-absorbed. Rather, she is a sweet, kind, supportive person whose life has been devoted to helping others improve the quality of their lives. Her devotion to others has paved the way for enormous success in Mannatech. In a candid interview at the elegant Crown Sterling Suites in Phoenix, Arizona, where our certified MA Training weekend was held, Marion discussed with me the strategies she has employed in building a large organization that now earns more money for her in one month than she previously made in one year. Enjoy!<BR><BR>DC: What's at the very top of your "Strategies for Success List"?<BR><BR>MC: Making sure that my inner activities - the way I think about myself, others and my world - are as productive as my outer activities. I know that I knew less about the mechanics of network marketing than many others who make less money in Mannatech than we make. I contribute that to my mindset. In a little more than one year, our business has put us into a mid-six-figure income.<BR><BR>DC: Obviously it took years to develop such a positive self-image and attitude, but how did you translate that into confidence for the network marketing business?<BR><BR>MC: I became a serious student of network marketing and Mannatech. I read a book a week and listened to audio cassettes every time I was in my car - about six tapes a week.<BR><BR>DC: Name some of the books you read that really helped you.<BR><BR>MC: "Being the Best You Can Be in MLM," "Wave 3: The New Era in Network Marketing," "Streetsmart Networking," "Living With Passion," "The Greatest Networker in the World," "MLM Magic," "Think and Grow Rich." There were many more, but these were some of the best.<BR><BR>DC: What kinds of audio tapes did you listen to?<BR><BR>MC: Mostly company tapes and others about network marketing and motivation. I listened to them over and over again until they really sank in.<BR><BR>DC: What kinds of "outer" activities contributed to your quick success?<BR><BR>MC: First, I developed a list of over 200 names of friends and acquaintances who I wanted to share the business with and called about four new people every day.<BR><BR>DC: What did you say when you called them?<BR><BR>MC: I told them I was involved with a new business named Mannatech and that people were having great success in improving their health with the company's products. I told them I would like to send them some information about the business opportunity and products. Then I would send them the stuff and follow up within a few days to check on their interest level and either sign them up or get them on the products.<BR><BR>DC: What "stuff" do you send them?<BR><BR>MC: (A big grin spreads across her face...) In the early days, anything I could get my hands on that I thought would interest them. Now, however, I use only the brochures and the "Mannatech Today" newspaper with an audio tape. The paper has more than enough valuable information in it. In fact, I use a highlighter pen to emphasize key parts that I think will match people's interests.<BR><BR>DC: Do you concentrate mostly on getting people to try the products or to try the business?<BR><BR>MC: I have tried to meet people wherever they are, and now I focus primarily on the business. I dedicate almost all my time to working with sincere business builders.<BR><BR>DC: How many people did you sponsor personally?<BR><BR>MC: We recruited about 20 people in our first three months. We didn't always place them direct to ourselves. We tried to keep family members and friends together. So, sometimes, we would place someone who was personally interested in the business under someone else they knew.<BR><BR>DC: How did you direct these people once they were committed to their business?<BR><BR>MC: That's a key question. I think it's very important to get people started properly. One of the things I stress is attending training meetings and the national events such as All-Star Training and rallies, local Master Associate Training, and ongoing leadership training times. I encourage people to attend all of the national events, local meetings and events, and re-audit Master Associate Training regularly.<BR>This is a real business and people need to have a strong grasp of the basics of networking and the specifics of Mannatech. They, too, need to become serious students of this business if they expect to succeed. Networking is a process of duplicating your success-producing activities---those inside our minds and those outside our minds---in others. So, I encourage people to read a lot and listen to as many tapes as possible. My partner and I created an audio tape called "Beyond Your Wildest Dreams" to share what we've done to be successful, plus offering a one-day seminar to help people set their goals and release their blocks, fears and limiting beliefs.<BR><BR>DC: I have noticed that there are many activities that people involve themselves in that are counterproductive, really distracting things, that they think are important. Have you noticed this, too?<BR><BR>MC: Yes! One thing people need to be mindful of is that all distractions are equal. I teach people to ask themselves this question about everything they do, "Is this a distraction or am I actually doing the business?" Some of the most common distractions are:<BR><UL><LI>Watching television,<LI>Negative conversation and complaining,<LI>Focusing on problems rather than solutions,<LI>Pettiness,<LI>Unnecessary "rest" times,<LI>Associating with non-supportive people,<LI>Reading non-Mannatech-related, non-growth producing literature including newspapers, magazines, newsletters.</UL><BR><BR>If you don't want to waste a lot of time, energy, and money, you must focus! And I do believe in living a balanced life.<BR><BR>DC: What are some important disciplines for success in Mannatech?<BR><BR>MC: <BR><UL><LI>Personal time to get centered within yourself.<LI>Quiet time to get focused on your goals and priorities.<LI>Personal time with family members and friends to keep those supportive relationships strong.<LI>Exercise to keep your body healthy.<LI>Staying organized. Don't let clutter build!<LI>Handle mail immediately.<LI>Maintain a "To Do" list.<LI>Never put an action item on the "To Do" list that can be done now.<LI>Brainstorm with your leaders.<LI>Use all the products.<LI>Lead by example. Never tell people to do things that you aren't doing.<LI>Write a newsletter to send to your downline. (We publish ours every other month.)<LI>Do weekly conference calls with the leaders in your group.<LI>Broadcast fax urgent updates to your leaders. (I do this several times a week.)<LI>Hold a weekly meeting. (We alternate a Business Briefing with Business Builders' Training every other week.)<LI>Refrain from calling Customer Service for information that you can get from your upline.<LI>Don't jump past your immediate upline leader. This keeps an organization tight and healthy.<LI>Present the business to new people every day - for yourself and your downline. (I do a lot of three-way calls.)</UL><BR><BR>DC: List some of the essential "tools of the trade."<BR><BR>MC: <BR><UL><LI>Three-way or conference calling phone service,<LI>A fax machine,<LI>A copy machine,<LI>Voice mail,<LI>A file cabinet,<LI>Speaker phone,<LI>A good portable phone.</UL><BR><BR>DC: Is there anything you would like to say to the readers in closing?<BR><BR>MC: Sure. Have fun with this business. Everything you do allows for a win/win opportunity, so enjoy the journey. Commit yourself to helping others attain their goals while staying focused on your own. Be grateful for being part of this. The payoff in friendship, fun and financial freedom is fantastic. I've never been involved in an endeavor that's been as deeply satisfying as Mannatech.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

For those who wish to be educated consumers and do not opt to earn all the bonuses stimulated by their business activities, the $229 Master Associate Pack is the most appropriate. And, finally, the $49 Consumer Associate Pack is perfect for those whose desire is to get the fine line of Mannatech products at the lowest possible prices.<BR><BR><BR></td></tr></table><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

CD-ROMs can store immense amounts of information in three formats: written, audio and video. These are an appealing option to simple written text, and they make accessing information a much more enjoyable activity. You can hear it, see it, and read it, all at the same time.<BR>As our Associates are aware, Mannatech is dedicated to providing business-building tools which are every bit as cutting edge as the products we market. To achieve that result, Mannatech has contracted with Polyphase Interactive to develop two Mannatech CD-ROM disks to present information about the company and its products. In selecting Polyphase Interactive, we've chosena company with proven expertise in diet, health and fitness, computer technology and multimedia application development.<BR>Our first CD will feature Mannatech's Optimal Health Plan. Hosting the video portions is Dr. John Branden (PhD, Clinical Nutrition) who has more than twenty years of clinical experience. Dr. Branden's work on individualized nutrition has received support from the highly regarded non-profit institution, the Price Pottenger Nutritional Foundation among others respected in the field ofhealth and nutrition.<BR>Among this CD's features are: <BR><UL><LI>An introduction to Mannatech's complete line of products.<LI>Videos, text, and graphics supporting the science behind these products.<LI>The Metabolic Profile survey and specific information related to the recommended diets.<LI>Information on fine tuning your diet and on exercise programs. 	<LI>Video interviews from Mannatech consumers, Scientific Teams and Management.<LI>An interactive lifestyle program to help the user track and achieve his/her weight loss, health, and fitness goals.<BR></UL><BR>This CD gives Mannatech Associates an incredible tool for developing product loyalty from our consumers.<BR>The second CD will be designed specifically as a recruiting tool. Polyphase will make certain that the Mannatech story is told in a compelling, interesting manner by showcasing Mannatech's unique qualities, our Associates, products, science and opportunity. Featured will be business-building testimonials, basic interface with Mannatech products and a section on compensation. As a recruiting tool, it stands alone. Your prospective Associate can browse through all the sections with ease or stop and take an in-depth look at any particular segment that interests him or her.<BR>Our two new CDs are only a taste of what the future has in store for Mannatech Associates. Very much like our proprietary health products, these clear, thorough, businesslike presentations will distinguish us from all competition.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Subsequently, over 66 patents have been issued worldwide to Carrington  Laboratories covering the isolation, characterization, stabilization, use and derivation process of this molecule.

He did graduate work at the University of Texas at Dallas receiving a Master's degree in 1983 while working on a glycobiology project - the structure of a plant lectin, Concanavalin A, in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). He completed his doctorate, also at the University of Texas at Dallas, in 1985 in physical organic chemistry. As a graduate student, he served an internship at Anderson-Clayton Foods (now part of Kraft) where his work was concentrated in the area of stabilizing fats for frying.<BR>In 1985, Eric began working with Dr. Bill McAnalley at Avacare, characterizing the active ingredients in aloe vera. This research eventually led to the patent filings for acemannan and Manapol&#174; powder. Later, as Director of Quality Assurance at Carrington Laboratories from 1987 to 1995, Eric produced the first batch of Manapol&#174; powder in Costa Rica in March 1993.<BR>Eric is listed on numerous patents and has authored a number of articles for publication.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Their Mannatech business grew so fast, they reached their goal in nine months! Unstoppable momentum? That's what Gayle and John will tell you.Gayle, the oldest of 12 children of a dentist, started helping in her dad's office when she was 12 years old. "It was a relief to get out of the house!" she reports. She became a dental hygienist and spent 15 years working for her father and set a precedent. All her brothers became dentists; her sisters all became hygienists.<BR>As her interest in the delivery of good health care grew, she formed a health care consulting firm with a dentist. Together they taught team-building workshops and gave seminars for dental teams where they helped office staffs become productive units much like families. One point Gayle specifically makes is that early on she began helping dentists create an office environment where patients saw themselves as clients and where they learned to take responsibility for themselves. That philosophy has really transferred, she says. Network marketing provides the best possible arena to do this.<BR>Gayle's first network marketing experience in 1989 taught her that the business works. She had wanted to get away from so much business travel. The home-based aspect and the residual income were what she was looking for. The checks, however, didn't represent the effort she was putting in. "When I met Ray Robbins," she reports, "he said, 'You can make much more than that in Mannatech.' He was right! When we went to Orlando and began to grasp the scope of this, we said, 'We can't NOT do this!'"<BR>"This gives us the opportunity to live based on our values," John said. A graduate of Albion College, he coached basketball, taught biology and was athletic director at a private school before earning his real estate license. "Real estate was a good fit for me," he says. "I'm big on listening. I teach my people to stop regurgitating all over everyone! That's because most sales are lost when people talk too much." He's demonstrated that the philosophy works. His real estate business is doing $100 million a year in sales.<BR>"I've always liked the network marketing concept," he went on. "Many people see the potential, but don't have the right opportunity. In Mannatech, it's a real opportunity to own and run your own business. You should invest yourself emotionally, intellectually, physically to that degree. Unlike other careers and professions where you're only as good as your last sale or operation or performance, Mannatech allows you to build and expand on every success. This is a Win/Win/Win situation."<BR>"There's so much power here", Gayle said, "in the products, in the people, in the company. They have our highest respect. These are unique products. This is a unique company. It's life-changing!"<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Can you say, Pete Laurence? Paradise Valley's own one-time pig farmer/commercial pilot/ consumer electronic guru. Pete's success comes from two critical character traits: old-fashioned determination and self-discipline. Results? Four-Star Mannatech Associate in 30 days.<BR>A native New Yorker, raised in southern California, with an Animal Science degree from Cal State Poly, he developed a commercial hog operation in Chino Valley, Arizona, becoming the state's biggest pig farmer. At 6'6" and 275 pounds, he clearly took the prize.<BR>A severe winter decimated Pete's herd. His livelihood in shambles, he worked odd jobs, and reluctantly accepted a friend's offer to sell cars at his dealership. "I don't know how to sell and I don't like people," Pete told him. With a promise of training and a desire to be clean, he took the job. Training? Locked in a room with tapes on salesmanship, he couldn't come out until he showed he could succeed. Of course he did! Pete loves a challenge.<BR>Then, trading a pig for ground school and basic flight instruction, he moved to Florida. In just four and a half months, he was certified as a Flight Instructor and commercial, multi-engine, instrument-rated pilot.<BR>Alert for new opportunities, Pete has also created and operated a chain of consumer electronics stores and dabbled in commercial real estate sales and development.<BR>"I've learned from everything I've done," Pete explains, "Pig business: economies of scale; flying airplanes; the value of personality-free systems; sales; the importance of communication skills." Blending these, he founded Visioneering Productions, a sales training and business development firm where he put his broadly diverse background to work helping others.<BR>Almost ten years ago, he first looked at network marketing. A friend asked him to evaluate an MLM opportunity. Pete said, "I think you're crazy even to consider such a thing!" However, the business intrigued him. He analyzed industry and company and decided to get involved. Other business interrupted his budding career. Today he regrets going inactive because some of those who started when Pete started and persisted are multimillionaires today!<BR>Eventually, he returned to network marketing, enjoying significant financial success although several bad experiences convinced him that it wasn't the right choice for him. When Gayle Hannet wanted him to look at Mannatech, Pete wasn't interested. Gayle persisted, introducing him to Ray Robbins. After consideration, Pete called Ray for more information, not expecting the successful millionaire to return his call immediately. Imagine his surprise when Ray called back at 11 p.m.!<BR>Still, Pete was cautious. "I really did my due diligence," he says. Auditing Master Associate Training, he was impressed both by Associates and by their enthusiasm for the products. "They weren't the typically greedy, scheming, graspy people MLM often brings to mind," he says. "It felt right. I signed up the next day, went to Dallas for the next All-Star Training and requested a place at the first Trainers' Certification training.<BR>"For very personal reasons, I set a goal to be Four-Star in 30 days and I did it! If you care sincerely about your friends and loved ones, you can't help sharing Mannatech products; they're just too important. As you share, the information/product-purchase/results sequence will generate money. Even if money's not your primary goal the company will send it to you anyway."To those who say, 'I don't know how to do that,' I explain, 'You can learn. No one was born a pig farmer or a bank president. Every professional learned his/her skills. With Mannatech's great training programs and learning materials, anyone who chooses to be successful can be!'<BR>"Once you fully understand Mannatech, it's so sensible, it's inspirational. The company's well capitalized and profitable. It has skilled management well grounded in business and the subtleties of network marketing."Mannatech's compensation plan is obviously the best in the industry, combining the best features of every other successful plan. It creates a career track where even new, inexperienced, part-time people can enjoy financial success immediately.<BR>"Mannatech's product line is the real key. Its proven effectiveness answers the most important question in business analysis; Would people continue to buy these products, even without income potential attached to the purchase?"Mannatech's richness transcends financial wealth. It's given me a greater feeling of stability and security than I've ever had. I'm more mellow and relaxed, more accepting. I have a great degree of positive expectancy. The more I share Mannatech with others, the better I feel. Old friends have said, 'Bless you for sharing the product.' New acquaintances thank me for 'finally showing me a networking program that works.'<BR>"Don't let anyone tell you that he or she can't do this. If a pig farmer can do it..."<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Their long-time friendship started as freshmen at the University of Maryland, has blossomed into a dynamic business in a field they never considered; network marketing! They bring some unique skills to this business.<BR>A serious student, Marian Head always focused on career. With a graduate degree in Educational Technology, she worked with the U.S. Senate for nine years and taught at the university level. "I thought Gail was crazy when she left her job," she says. "I was so fulfilled working in an organization. The first right brain thing I ever did was learn T'ai Chi. On my way to a workshop, I arranged a layover in San Francisco to see our friend, Marion Culhane. I mentioned some health problems I was having and she gave me some Mannatech products to try. I took them back to Boulder and told Gail about them. I could see that they had a beneficial effect on me, but not until Marion mentioned how much she was earning every month did it occur to either of us to turn this into a business. We were thinking on the consumer level. Completely unaccustomed to thinking of network marketing as serious business, we thought, 'This is a joke! What are we doing?'"<BR>What they're doing is moving past pre-defined paths. After the U. of Maryland, Gail attended the Corcoran School of Art, toured with a famous artist, practiced fine art and supported herself as a commercial artist. Moving to Boulder, she looked for something that would allow her to combine artistic expression with people, and found her niche in training and consulting. As rewarding as it was, there were also frustrations. Just three weeks after a successful team-building workshop she conducted for a major client, the company moved to consolidate and half her class received pink slips. "This is no fun," she thought, "I need to find something else."<BR>It was then that Marion Culhane offered them the Mannatech opportunity. When Gail and Marian realized what a superb business opportunity it was, they invested their considerable energies into making it a success. "Much of what we're doing in Mannatech," Marian says, "is what we were doing in corporate America."<BR>"We both realized that, unlike corporate America, there was no ceiling here," Gail says. "it's the most extraordinary personal development workshop I've ever been in. We've both learned a lot about perspective, about how you look at your business. Hobbyists and serious business builders look at this from completely different viewpoints. When we made an internal shift and began seeing it as a business, we learned to look for leaders instead of trying to share it with the whole world. Things really began to click. We committed to learn and grow, to change and keep going."<BR>"Originally, we committed for one year. We've already renewed that for four years! Marian says. "Richard Howard asked us in Orlando when we would be Presidential. We thought about it and said, 'By Seattle' Then we realized that was a lot of business- building to do if we were going to get there! Thank goodness for Marion Culhane! She's a great coach. She steps me through a sequence that really works for me, going from intention to reaction.' Claim the intention,' she says. 'Remove the limiting beliefs and let all the reactions come up to the intention.'"<BR>Obviously it works! Honored as Four-Star Presidential Associates, inducted into the Ring of Honor at Mannatech's Fall meeting in Bellevue, WA, Marian and Gail are now part of a team working on training materials that will be the envy of the industry.<BR>But when has the industry seen a partnership like this? A twosome that produces some serious business-building statistics and relishes every single minute of it!<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Strong, goal-oriented, self-motivated, and hard-working are only a few of the qualities that make them such a great Mannatech success story. In the last ten months since they have been with us they have made over $225,000 and their income is just plain skyrocketing.<BR>Dwight grew up in the piano, organ, and keyboard retail business. His family owns 17 outlets and is very successful. Dwight, a concert jazz pianist, spent a lot of time as the front man for the stores-playing and speaking at mall and new store openings. He was just about to buy out the family business and fully lock himself into that industry when a strange phenomenon occurred with his perspective on business. His wife Susan was steadily making about $10,000 a month with another network marketing company for a number of years, and he began to envy her lifestyle. In the morning as they would kiss good-bye, he would leave home for work in a business suit, and she would leave for the beach in her bathing suit. They both worked hard when they worked, but she could take a cellular phone with her to the beach and do her business and her time always seemed to be her own. He, on the other hand, was required to march to the beat of a different drum, one that was pounded on by the dictates of the retail industry's hours and "corporate image" standards. Though the money looked good on both sides of the business fence, the lifestyle was definitely better on Susan's side. <BR>As a result of his increased interest in MLM they hired a $200-an-hour MLM consultant to evaluate their financial prospects as a team in networking. Dwight was considering not buying the family business (the bird in the hand) and going after MLM full-time. After the consultant reviewed Susan's (former) MLM company, their combined business style and talent mix, he informed them that they would never make their goal of one million dollars a year through Susan's company. She had been very successful, but her income had flattened out at $10,000 a month. He suggested that it would never get much higher, even if they both worked it.<BR>That led into phase two of the consultant's task: finding a company that would provide them that million-dollar-a-year opportunity. The guidelines were very rigid. The ideal company for them would: <BR><BR>1) Possess a genuine ground-floor opportunity, meaning that it was no more than a few years old and was not already doing more than $100,000,000 a year in sales;<BR><BR>2) Have products that would produce high resale demand because the emotional and/or physical experience necessitated the consumer's unwavering consumption or use;<BR><BR>3) Represent, in their products, cutting-edge technology that was brand new to the marketplace, and if possible, would have exclusive marketing rights to that technology;<BR><BR>4) Savvy management at the corporate level in creative marketing, technological breakthrough development, and business operations;<BR><BR>5) Be just beyond "infant" stage in business development and had a sufficient amount of growth momentum already in place;<BR><BR>6) Have "deep pocket" or, in other words, sufficient reserve capital to take advantage of any bright new opportunities or fix any major "bumps in their road;"<BR><BR>7) Have a large number of people who are not "professional" network marketers (people who had a pre-existing downline before entering the business) making substantial amounts of money.<BR><BR>Over 100 companies were carefully researched and Mannatech was the company the consultant recommended. "The biggest deciding factor for me," said Dwight, "was that Mannatech already had people making $30,000 a month who had never had any success in MLM before...I knew we had found our 'goose that lays the golden eggs...'" Sam Caster remembers how strictly the Haveners scrutinized and investigated the company, "Man! They asked all the tough questions...I knew these people meant business!"<BR>Dwight and Susan are dedicated and focused individuals in everything they do, from network marketing to Dwight's passion for triathlon competitions. They came from out of nowhere and put Florida on the Mannatech map. In eight months, they were already making over $30,000 a month. They train their people thoroughly for success and are seeing their people hit the big 5-figure monthly incomes right along with them. "Our goal was to be making $50,000 a month at the end of our first year and an annual income of $1,000,000 in our second year. Thanks to God and our wonderful people we are on track!"The goal that drives them more than any other is to produce at least 100 millionaires in their organization within their first five years in business. Folks, if you have never seen MLM legends in the making, the Haveners are a couple to watch. With their drive and commitment to the success of the people in their organization they are sure to be among Mannatech's biggest money earners for years to come.<BR>Dwight and Susan, thanks for bringing your energy and focus to the Mannatech family. We love you, and we love the example you are setting for all of us who want to maximize the potential of this great opportunity.

Southwest Conference Player of the Decade for the '70s. NBA player for the Kansas City Kings, the New Jersey Nets and the Boston Celtics. Four times an NBA All-Star. <BR>Otis Birdsong has been in the spotlight for years. "When you're in the spotlight," he says, "people constantly want you to endorse or sell their products. Network marketers were the most persistent, loading friends up with products that were unsaleable or that earned very little." MLM people who contacted him always seemed to be in it for the money and nothing else, he said. It didn't fit his philosophy. "To me it looked like a pyramid with the money flowing to the people at the top."<BR>Still skeptical when he ran into Richard Howard and George Gervin from Mannatech, he tried SPORT and found that it really helped. "Most professional athletes have all sorts of aches and pains," he said. "We try to stay in shape as we get older, but we live on aspirin and ice packs. I used to ice my knee for 30 minutes every time I ran four or five miles. One day, after I started using Mannatech products, I realized that I hadn't had an aspirin or used an ice pack in weeks! That's when I started thinking about friends who might benefit from these products.<BR>"It's one thing to see how much you benefit personally. To offer this kind of value to people you care about and then to create a business around it is something else. Since I started listening to Richard and doing what he said, it's been simple. Deborah and I became One-Stars almost without trying. Once you try these products, you're sold! My wife loves the products and the Mannatech opportunity. She's right!

It's true. Although this lady has seen her share of triumphs and tragedies - 70 years' worth - she's sunny, infinitely optimistic and excited about this new direction her life is taking. "Every event I attend, everything I learn about Mannatech convinces me more that this company and these products are for everyone." she says. Within four days of first learning about the company in early 1994, she was enrolled as an Associate and on her way to Texas to attend a rally.<BR>"I've always had a passion for helping others," she explains. "Mannatech products let me do that while I help myself at the same time." How? "To develop this as a business, you need some major rearrangements of your priorities, unending dedication and no TV or comfy rocking chair. I have a gold and crystal rocking chair necklace. That's as close as I get!<BR>"This is a product of the future," Jane says, "and we have it right here, right now. When I first met the doctors and Sam, I couldn't understand why they were always smiling. As I learned about the products and the company, I knew why! They have the vision to see, and the faith to endure. I share that.<BR>"You have to decide whether this is a hobby or a business for you. If it's a business, you need products and training.

Both Olympic athletes, they know about wellness issues. They've seen dozens of promising health solutions come and go, never living up to the PR.<BR>Mannatech is different, Michelle says. Often sick as a youngster, she turned to swimming, vitamins and other supplements. She earned a degree in P. E. and Kiniesiology and Olympic synchronized swimming gold medals. Now her workshops help participants overcome fear and achieve their own personal gold. She says, "The sports window of opportunity used to be open for such a short time. Mannatech products and healthier lifestyles are helping us to manage the extension of it. This is exciting!" <BR>Al agrees. He went from the state to the national program in volleyball, played pro volleyball in Europe and represented Canada on Olympic volleyball teams. For five of the 13 years he played, he captained the Canadian National team. Now a building contractor, he has just built the family a new home on the outskirts of Calgary. <BR>When a friend phoned and asked them to look at Mannatech, they liked what they saw. Michelle called her father who had researched aloe to check this out. His report? "It's incredible." <BR>Cautious, Al took Em¥Pact and Sport and tested it on the volleyball team. Great results. "When Sam Caster came to Calgary, he answered every one of our questions," Michelle says. "Testimonials and physical results are more impressive than we first imagined. With Mannatech, we're now in a position to take care of our families. Mannatech makes it possible!"<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

And Mannatech has that balance between the effectiveness of the products and the genuine financial opportunity.<BR>"We enjoy working together," the Coxes explained. "Working together in Mannatech is really not work. It's a gift, a pleasure, a lifestyle where we see that we can make a difference in people's lives every day. We see the products working wonders; we see people totally changing their financial situations." "It's amazing," Rich commented. "Every day I get up thinking, 'Wow! I get to do this. I get to work with some of the finest people in the world.' I'm really humbled by it. The fact that we've been very successful doesn't feed my ego. It reinforces my belief that we're doing what we're supposed to. It's a kind of calling. When I studied for the ministry, one of my professors told me, 'Only go into the ministry full-time if you're totally consumed by it.' That's the way we feel about Mannatech."<BR>"We investigated the company thoroughly," Valerie explained. "We'd been involved with nutritional products for 15 years, but we'd seen people get burned. Other companies just disappeared, so it was important to us to learn as much as we could. We spent three days at a Dallas meeting, visiting the home office, meeting the company officers, verifying the stability, soundness, integrity and longevity. We couldn't have been more im-pressed. We signed up!" <BR>Laughing, she rephrased a popular network marketing slogan: "The opportunity of a lifetime..." "Before you know whether it's the opportunity of a lifetime, you have to know how much lifetime there is in the opportunity! Mannatech's products are the key. In the future, we know Mannatech will be there!"<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

"My career didn't follow any logical order, but along the way I developed every skill I needed to prepare me for Mannatech."A graduate of prestigious Connecticut College, Marcia worked first for MIT, then as the president's assistant in a small biomedical research firm gaining accounting, sales and presentation skills.<BR>Moving to California, she married and helped her husband run his resorts and rental properties. Together, they learned facilitation, listening and reflecting skills from Eductivism, becoming ordained ministers, doing individual and group counseling. She has since co-founded The Church for Spiritual Discovery to continue this counseling work. She also trained as a Montessori pre-school teacher, finding she needed all these skills to support herself and three young children after a divorce.<BR>Nine years of happy remarriage later, major problems arose. Divorced again, emotionally exhausted and heavily in debt, with few possessions and little income, she completed a degree as a Naturopathic Doctor and a PhD in Nutrition. Alone with four young children and a mountain of debt, she found support and renewal in a 12-step program for families and friends of addicts. Mannatech was the gift that then appeared in her life.<BR>"Previous network marketing convinced me that the concept would work," Marcia says. "When I was introduced to Mannatech, I took the trouble to research it, to see whether it was as exceptional as it seems. My scrutiny revealed a serious company with sound business practices. It's here for the long run. Anyone with a serious interest in health or business must look at it."<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Mannatech has licensed exclusively a line of metabolically profiled nutritional supplements specifically formulated to address the genetic nutritional requirements of three general metabolic categories. Determining your metabolic profile and the corresponding amount of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins needed in your diet as well as the appropriate formula of nutritional supplements, is achieved through completion of a simple, 50-question survey. Because the interactions among food compounds are so complex and the physiology of individuals is so varied, a diet or supplement that works for some may not work for others. Since nutrients are the body's fuel for performance, the right fuel is the key to success.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Wellness is actually a personal choice which incorporates preventive health care into our personal routines. While it sounds relatively simple, many people find it to be too much trouble to stay on schedule with a balanced diet, optimal nutritional supplements, regular exercise and plenty of rest. Yet, those are just the basics.<BR>The basics provide a real foundation. If wellness has never been part of your daily routine, it's not too late to start improving your general health with some minimal lifestyle changes. You'll be genuinely surprised at how good it's possible to feel. Many people accept a much lower quality of life than they deserve, yet, people tend to accept that if they've never experienced anything different.<BR>One perpetual battlefront is weight management. A study completed in December 1995 using Mannatech products MVP caplets and Man&#183;Aloe&#174; capsules in conjunction with an optimal health program that included physical activity and a healthy diet showed that 97% of the subjects in the clinical trial experienced a positive change. The protocol, titled The Metabolic Trim Program, tested two groups of 100 adults. The test was designed to determine the percentage of subjects who could realize a positive change in body composition during a four-week trial period. The change could be loss of fat, gain of lean tissue or both. The overwhelmingly positive results supported results seen in earlier tests. The study was headed by Gilbert R. Kaats, PhD, Director of the Health and Medical Research Foundation in San Antonio, Texas, where the trials took place.<BR>Particular emphasis was placed on the importance of being proactive in developing and supporting the immune system and thus enabling each person the opportunity of functioning at optimal capacity with regard to health and wellness.<BR><BR><B>SUBJECTS</B><BR>Subjects were recruited through newspaper advertising, flyers and by word-of-mouth from people who had either participated in previous Foundation studies or who heard of this study through a Mannatech Associate.<BR>The study's objectives were to examine the effectiveness and the safety of Mannatech's Optimal Health Plan (MOHP) over a period of either four or eight weeks. A total of 528 subjects were recruited. The group was 68% female with an average age of 50.4 years. The remaining 32% was male with an average age of 53.1 years. <BR>Of the 528 subjects, 428 were divided into four separate groups operating in three different locations, each with precise sets of instructions for achieving optimal health. The remaining 100 subjects followed the same plan, but consumed placebos rather than Mannatech phytochemical supplements.Participation in the MOHP involved taking either two or three Mannatech phytochemical supplements daily plus following a lifestyle modification program which included suggestions for increased physical activity, improved nutrition, lifestyle modification techniques and a mild-to-moderate caloric restriction.<BR><BR><B>PROCEDURES, MATERIALS AND METHODS</B><BR>All subjects received a copy of "Living at an Optimal Goal Weight" behavior modification program. This included an activity monitor which measured total daily physical activity, a portable food scale, and the "Living at Goal Weight" manual. Also included were lessons in behavior modification on both audio and video tape.<BR>The subjects, who received either a four- or eight-week supply of Mannatech supplements, recorded daily estimates of their caloric intake, consumption of dietary fat, and daily activity levels as reflected by their activity monitors. Weekly totals were reported during weekly visits to the research center. <BR>Progress was recorded by various methods including comparison of the 50-item Disease/Wellness Symptom Inventory (DWSI) which each subject completed both before beginning the plan and immediately following its completion. Each individual's body composition was measured either by underwater testing (the displacement method) using the Whiter Volumeter or by Lunar Corporation's Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scanner.<BR>Since product/program efficacy can best be defined as fat loss while maintaining or increasing fat-free mass (FFM), a Body Composition Improvement (BCI) score reflecting positive or negative changes that occurred during the study was calculated for each subject. In calculating the BCI, losses in body fat and increases in FFM were calculated as positive changes. Increases in body fat and decreases in FFM were calculated as negative changes. To illustrate: A subject who lost two lbs. of body fat and gained one lb. of FFM receive a Body Composition Improvement score of +3 while a subject who lost two lbs. of body fat and also lost two pounds of FFM received a BCI score of 0.<BR><BR><B>RESULTS</B><BR>Subjects in all five groups lost significant amounts of body fat without any appreciable loss of lean body mass. When compared to the placebo control group, however, subjects in the four experimental groups (those using phytochemical supplements) lost significantly more body weight and fat. Data from the DWSI revealed that for all self-reported disease symptoms listed, subjects in the phytochemical supplement groups reported improvement. Additionally, subjects in the experimental groups taking Mannatech products reported greater appetite control, less binge eating as measured by an abbreviated Binge Eating Disorder Scale, increased energy levels, improved sleep, and an improvement in general well-being.<BR>A distinctly unique and consistent finding for subjects following the MOHP was that approximately 12% had significant positive changes in their body composition, losing more fat and/or gaining more lean mass than has been observed in any of the other studies the Foundation has conducted on weight loss/health plans. These dramatic changes were found in all four experimental groups using both the underwater and DEXA technology.<BR>Regarding safety and toxicity, five subjects reported mild allergic-like reactions to the product and were discontinued from the study. Using group averages, no adverse effects were observed in any of the 51 blood chemistries measured for any of the five groups. A total of 193 subjects had their blood pressure and resting heart rates measured on a weekly basis, and no significant increases in either of these vital signs were observed.<BR><BR><B>CONCLUSIONS</B><BR>The subjects using the phytochemical supplements in conjunction with the MOHP experienced significant positive changes as evidenced by body composition and self-reported symptoms. The changes observed were significantly greater than those achieved by the subjects who followed the same plan but did not take the phytochemical supplements.<BR><BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In fact, the positive changes in body composition in subjects #1-7 are the most dramatic we have observed after conducting over 20,000 body composition tests in conjunction with previous research studies. Another note of interest is the number and variety of self-reported disease symptoms that were reportedly improved, even from the subjects who did not see noticeable changes in body composition.A word of caution: These results are preliminary and some caution should be exercised in interpreting these data.<p><H4>An analysis of the data from the 4-week program revealed:</H4><UL><LI>97% of the subjects either lost weight or had a positive change in their lean-to-fat ratios.<LI>A total of four people lost 14 or more pounds.

Allowing for fluid depletion, she probably gained two pounds of muscle mass.<LI>The most dramatic change in lean-to-fat ratios was achieved by a 171 pound woman who had a 21 pound improvement in her body composition losing 10 pounds of body fat while gaining 11 pounds of lean mass. She was followed closely by a 163 pound woman who had a 17 pound improvement in her body composition, gaining 8 pounds of lean mass and losing 9 pounds of body fat.<p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2><BR><FONT SIZE = 3>Available E-Mail addresses are as follows:<BR><A HREF="mailto:ldaniel@mail.mannatech-inc.com">Customer Service<BR> Email contact for customer service questions and problems.</A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>Copyright &copy; 1996 Mannatech, Inc. all rights reserved.<BR></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<H2>Charles Keating:<BR>
Scoundrel or Scapegoat?</H2>


<TABLE>



<FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>n Dec. 2, a Los Angeles federal judge threw
out Charles Keating Jr.'s 1993 federal racketeering, conspiracy and fraud
convictions stemming from the collapse of the Lincoln Savings & Loan
Association. Several jurors, the judge found, had been tainted by knowledge of
a prior state conviction of Keating -- a conviction that, coincidentally, had
been reversed in April. The man who symbolized the savings-and-loan crisis of
the late 1980s was now free.
<P>
"He's an innocent man now; he hasn't been convicted of anything," his attorney,
Stephen Neal, told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>.
<P>
Not convicted, yes. But innocent? Keating is still on the hook for part of a
$1.6 billion civil judgment for defrauding investors. He had taken a sleepy
industry that doled out mortgages to one that invested in risky real estate and
junk bonds to the elderly. His accusers say that the four and a-half years that
he spent in prison are not enough punishment for the losses his investors and
taxpayers suffered and prosecutors may yet have their way with him.
<P>
Keating has maintained throughout that he has been the victim of know-nothing
regulators and overzealous prosecutors and that he ran his businesses on the
up-and-up. And other observers say pinning the failure of an industry on the
shoulders of one individual distracts from an examination of more fundamental
systemic problems.
<P>
So what is it? Is Charles Keating a scapegoat or a scoundrel? We've gathered
four experts for an online discussion of that question.
<P>
<A NAME=neal>Our panelists are:<BR></A>
<B>STEPHEN NEAL</B>, Keating's lawyer and a partner in the Palo Alto office of
San Francisco's Cooley Godward. </FONT>(Read a <A
HREF=../../edt1114c.html><I>Recorder</I> profile</A> of Stephen Neal.)<FONT
SIZE=+1>
<A NAME=cabra><P></A>
<B>ELIZABETH CABRASER</B>, one of the lead attorneys in the civil litigation
against Keating. Cabraser is a partner at the San Francisco consumer
class-action firm Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein.
<A NAME=ely><P></A>
<B>BERT ELY</B>, a financial-industry consultant who was one of the first
analysts to predict the bailout of the FSLIC. Ely, who runs his own Alexandria,
Virginia, consulting firm has ified frequently before Congressional committees
investigating S&L industry. He has appeared as an expert witness in several S&L
cases, although not in those against Keating.
<A NAME=raph><P></A>
<B>IRA RAPHAELSON</B>, a former U.S. special counsel for financial institutions
crime. Raphaelson oversaw most of the federal prosecutions in the S&L arena,
including that of Keating. He is a Washington partner for Los Angeles-based
O'Melveny & Myers.
<A NAME=pes><P></A>
Moderating the discussion is <B>PETER SCHEER</B>, editor and publisher of
<I>The Recorder</I>, a daily legal newspaper in the San Francisco.
<P>
Our panelists are conversing via e-mail and the text of their comments,
rearranged and cleaned up slightly to ease reading, are being assembled here in
different "takes" as the conversation unfolds. As each take is posted you'll
have access to it from the top of this page.

  <B><font size=+2>E</font>ach month, Counsel Connect produces online
  seminars   for   lawyers   on substantive legal, management, and business
development topics.  Many of these programs are offered for CLE credit</B>.
</P><P>
Like the live, in-person seminars you've attended,  Counsel Connect's online
seminars 
feature top-notch panels and give attendees  collections of current and
relevant reference documents.  The big difference: Counsel Connect Seminars are
interactive. 
Panelists discuss the issues and attendees  ask questions at any time.
 Guaranteed, no one  drones on for 45 minutes as you fight to stay awake! 
</P><P>
Seminar attendees participate by reading faculty comments and posing their own
direct questions, contributing their expertise to the seminar and raising the
issues they'd like to see addressed. Since 1995 we've produced more than <a

href="/inside/seminars/pastsems.html">120 online 
seminars</a> with known specialists from around the world. 
If you're a lawyer, we hope you'll join us for some of our upcoming events. 
</P>

Everyday, the members of Counsel Connect discuss the news from a unique perspective, be it a blockbuster Supreme Court decision or new legislation. Counsel Connect is open only to practicing lawyers, however. So when a hot issue is burning up a discussion forum, we post excerpts of it on Counsel Quote's <A HREF="/counselquote/hottop.html">Hot Topics</A> page.</P>

<P>You might have more particular needs, though. Need a source for a story? Go to the <A HREF="/counselquote/media.html">Queries</A> area to tell us your question -- we'll post it on Counsel Connect for our members to see. Or check our listing of experts by specialty -- like antitrust, criminal law and many others -- by using the <A HREF="/counselquote/experts.html">Experts On Call</A> area. Want to poll lawyers about a particular issue? We'll do it for you with <A HREF="/counselquote/canvas.html">Counsel Canvass</A>. Need an idea for a legal story? Check <A HREF="/counselquote/stories.html">Story Ideas</A>, where attorneys present you with topics they think may be exciting. You can also search a database of Counsel Connect members and other lawyers by going to <A HREF="/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</A>.</P>

<P>So add Counsel Quote to your bookmark file. And when there's an issue for which you need an articulate, well-educated legal viewpoint, don't reach for your phone, reach for your mouse and call up Counsel Quote.</P></FONT>

<P>The Internet may offer a wealth of information but mining out the nuggets you're looking for can be a frustrating experience. Of course, there are plenty of search engines out there -- but who has time to search each one and compile the results?</P>

<P>Enter the Internet Concierge: a living, breathing <I>human being </I> who will help you locate resources on the Internet. The Internet Concierge service is offered by Counsel Connect, the largest online community for lawyers. Our editors can teach you how to make the Internet an accessible legal research tool.</P>

<H3>What Is The Concierge?</H3>

<P>Let's say you're researching an environmental law issue, need information on breast implant litigation, or are curious about the anticipated impact of a bill pending in Congress. Ask the Internet Concierge to let you know what resources are available. The Concierge will conduct a comprehensive search using a variety of search engines. Search results, along with an explanation of how they were found, will be sent directly to your email box.</P>

<H3>What Can The Concierge Do?</H3>

<P>Here are some recent examples of how our service typically works:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Responding to a question about resources on labor and employment law in Ontario, Canada, the Concierge uncovered summaries of print guides by a number of legal publishers, a continuing legal education catalog, a guide to legislation published by the provincial government, and several newsletters published by law firms.<P>

<LI>A request for information on how the v-chip works yielded four websites and five newsgroups -- including FAQ files filled with v-chip information.<P>

<LI>A lawyer interested in suits brought against tobacco companies by state attorneys general was referred to the Court TV Law Library which contains electronic versions of key documents in these cases, along with a host of other relevant web sites.<P>

<LI>A lawyer who needed bankruptcy sources was provided with the searchable index of U.S. Supreme Court bankruptcty decisions, the American Bankruptcy Institute's homepage, the Internet Bankruptcy Library, and instructions on how to subscribe to two bankruptcy listservs.
</UL>

<H3>What Does The Concierge Service Cost?</H3>

<P>The service is free to Counsel Connect members. Non-members are charged $29.95 for each search.</P>

<H3>How Do I Start?</H3>

<P>Click on the 'Transmit' button below and enter your request. If your request is too broad, our editors will help refine your search. Replies are usually sent within 48 hours on business days.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1> <P><B>I would like to <A HREF="inetconform.html"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="images/transmit.gif"></A> a request to the Internet Concierge. I understand that if I am not a CC member I will be charged $29.95 if the Internet Concierge conducts a successful search on my behalf, and that the Counsel Connect's billing department will call me to verify a major credit card number before forwarding my request to the Internet Concierge.</B></P></FONT>

PETER SCHEER:<BR>
I'd like Steve Neal, as the sole Keating advocate, to open the discussion.
Steve, most of the panelists think that Charles Keating is a crook with a smart
lawyer. Please make the case that Keating is not a crook, but a victim of the
government.
<P>


STEPHEN NEAL:<BR>
Charlie Keating is very much a victim of the government.
<P>
He is a victim because he has spent over 4&#189; years in prison on two
unconstitutional convictions. The constitutional defects in those convictions
were clear, on the record, under controlling precedent at the time of his
trials. The defects were brought to the attention of both the Superior Court in
Los Angeles and the District Court in Los Angeles at the time of the trials,
yet it took over four years to get relief. Nor were these constitutional
defects "technicalities." In the state case, the court gave instructions which
permitted Keating's conviction without any proof of criminal intent. That error
was critical to the outcome, because there was no evidence of criminal intent
on Keating's part, circumstantial or direct. In the federal trial, the jury was
improperly exposed to and impermissibly discussed Keating's state conviction.
The prejudice from that jury misconduct was severe, particularly given the
fact, as found by the Ninth Circuit, that the evidence of Keating's guilt was
not overwhelming.
<P>
These constitutional violations arose and persisted because Keating became
vilified as the symbol of the savings and loan crisis. That notoriety was
undeserved. Keating was as much a victim of the savings and loan crisis as
anyone and more of a victim than most people. At a time when the industry was
already in the red, Keating was induced to invest his money, his energy and his
future in a deregulated industry. His investments in land, buildings and
securities were permitted under the law and approved by both state and federal
regulators. The sale of bonds in Lincoln branches was known to, and effectively
encouraged and approved by, federal and state regulators. Sales practices were
policed by the state of California and found fully satisfactory. The bond
prospectuses described the nature of the investments and the risks in
great detail and with great clarity -- as even the prosecution's own expert in
the state case admitted. All of the money raised from deposits and bond sales
went into hard assets -- land, hotels, office buildings, securities. Despite
the public perception, there was no "looting."
<P>
When the government passed the 1986 tax reform act, momentarily destroyed the
high-yield bond market with its attacks on Wall Street and re-regulated the
savings and loan industry, savings and loans, including Lincoln, suffered
immediate short term losses in the market values of their assets. Regulators
then seized scores of savings and loans, including Lincoln, locked in losses by
disposing of assets at fire-sale prices and caused a huge, avoidable loss to
the fisc and to investors. Then, in an audacious but largely successful move,
the regulators, with the aid of prosecutors, set out to blame the
owner-operators who were, in a real sense, the greatest victims of all. Keating
was their tallest target and their biggest victim. 
<P>


IRA RAPHAELSON:<BR>
Charles Keating was one of a number of high-profile prosecutions brought by the
Justice Department among literally thousands of cases the Department brought
through a deliberative process designed to prosecute traditional crimes of
lying, cheating and stealing. Despite tremendous media and Congressional
pressure to alter its standards, federal prosecutive policy was to bring
financial-institution fraud cases where the standards of the Federal Principles
of Prosecution were met -- that is, the prosecutor believed that there was
proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the elements of the offense. In the Keating
case, like the other 4,000 federal prosecutions, the charges required proof of
intent to defraud. The Department's conviction rate was over 90 percent in the
financial-institution fraud cases it brought and this conviction rate stands as
a direct rebuttal to any suggestion that prosecutive discretion was
misdirected.
<P>


PETER SCHEER:<BR>
Elizabeth, your civil suit yielded the only judgment against Keating that has
not been reversed or dismissed after trial. Based on the evidence in your case,
was Keating victimized by the judicial process?
<P>


ELIZABETH CABRASER:<BR>
Charles Keating is no victim. He needed -- and was fortunate to obtain -- a
very good and very dedicated lawyer. The real victims of the Lincoln Savings
debacle were the trusting depositors who were induced to switch from federally
insured accounts to non-insured and risky Lincoln Savings bonds. We were
fortunate to obtain a recovery for these bondholders, in civil proceedings
brought under the federal securities laws (now largely gutted by federal reform
legislation), civil RICO, and common-law claims. The major credit for this
should go to Joe Cotchett and his firm, the Milberg Weiss firm, and my partner
Bill Hirsch, together with the other plaintiffs' lawyers who served on the
trial team before Judge Bilby in Arizona. I worked with the bondholders to get
and keep the class certified. Through this experience I learned that, while our
ACC/Lincoln Savings multi-district litigation did ultimately achieve gratifying
results for the bondholders, they suffered greatly in the interim. 
<P>
The bondholders' story is summarized in Judge Bilby's 1992 decision denying the
motion of Lincoln Chairman Keating and the other defendants to decertify the
class, published at 140 F.R.D. 425 (D. Ariz. 1992). It describes the
bait-and-switch tactics by which officers at the Lincoln Savings branches were
induced to transfer their savings from insured accounts to higher yielding
Lincoln Savings bonds. Lincoln told its bond representatives to target what
Lincoln dubbed "the weak, the meek, and the ignorant" among its depositors with
a standardized sales pitch, characterized by the court as a "centrally
orchestrated strategy" to mislead bond purchasers into believing that the bonds
were safe. They weren't. 
<P>
As a result, thousands of bondholders lost everything they had, and waited
years for their recovery. They are the real victims of the Lincoln Savings
scam. Many were plunged into poverty, and there are documented instances of
suicide and other personal tragedies attributed by the victims themselves to
this loss. Keating spent some time in jail, but his victims spent years in
hell. Their only mistake was to repose trust in a man and his institution that
held themselves out as fiduciaries. 
<P>
The Lincoln Savings tragedy was repeated at numerous other savings and loans.
Charles Keating alone is not responsible for this industry-wide scandal. It had
its roots in the failure of public regulation, and the resulting fatal gap
between the standards of good faith, fair dealing and responsibility to which,
in the public mind, savings and loans as banking institutions were held, and
the virtually nonexistent standards in actual force. Bondholders and other
investors were the primary victims. The taxpayers who have footed the bill for
the savings and loan bailout were the secondary victims. Since it appears we
cannot have both, I prefer having Charles Keating free and his victims with
their money back, to the alternative of a jailed Keating and penniless
investors. But it is difficult, in the context of the actions of the
institution he directed and for which he is accountable, to view Charles
Keating as deserving of sympathy.
<P>


STEPHEN NEAL:<BR>
Elizabeth asserts that trusting depositors were induced to switch their monies
from federally insured accounts to non-insured and risky Lincoln Savings bonds.
That was the central theme in the public attacks on Keating, in the state
criminal case and in Judge Bilby's characterization of the case.
<P>
But that popular theme is just plain wrong.
<P>
The bond prospectuses said on their face that the bonds were uninsured and
risky. Every bond purchaser who testified for the prosecution in the state
criminal case admitted that they knew both that the bonds were uninsured and
that the bond proceeds were being used for real estate, hotel and other risky
investments. These same witnesses testified that they were told not to invest
any money in Lincoln bonds that they could not afford to lose.
<P>
All of the bond salespeople who testified for the prosecution testified that
they had been instructed to and did tell bond purchasers that the bonds were
uninsured and risky and that purchasers should not invest money they couldn't
afford to lose. The person who ran the bond program testified for the
prosecution under a cooperation agreement. He testified under cross-examination
that his only instruction from Keating concerning the bond sales program was
that he, Keating, wanted the program "squeaky clean."
<P>
It was because of this overwhelming, uncontroverted evidence, coming entirely
from the prosecution's own witnesses, that the prosecution could only get a
conviction with an unconstitutional strict-liability instruction which omitted
any requirement of criminal intent on Keating's part.
<P>
Judge Bilby's views of the case went largely unchallenged. Given the pending
criminal case, Keating did not defend the civil case. Worse, Judge Bilby forced
Keating to sit for a deposition in the civil case while the criminal cases were
pending. Keating had no choice but to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights, and
Judge Bilby then allowed Keating's Fifth Amendment assertions to be used
against those defendants who did try the case. There was never a full, fair
airing of the issues.
<P>
Lincoln did not target the weak, the meek and the ignorant. That phrase was
coined by a low-level employee in a misplaced attempt at humor. The joke was
neither known to nor condoned by Keating or Lincoln management at the time, and
it was repudiated when reported. It is a poor reflection on our justice system
that a joke, albeit a bad one, could help block a reasoned view of the real and
relevant evidence. 
<P>
Investors were given an opportunity to invest in bonds whose risks were
disclosed, according to the state prosecution's own expert, "warts and all."
Investors suffered not because of wrongdoing by Keating. They suffered because
the assets underlying those investments were dramatically and temporarily
reduced in value by government action, seized by the regulators and then sold
to wealthy investors who captured the rebounding appreciation in value while
investors, the taxpayers and Keating suffered greatly.
<P>


PETER SCHEER:<BR>
Bert, what's your response to Steve's take on the role of regulators in
causing/exacerbating the S&L crises?
<P>


BERT ELY:<BR>
The two S&L crises were the consequence of numerous public-policy failures. We
have identified 16 of them, nine of which pre-date 1980, when problems in the
S&L industry first surfaced. The two primary causes -- the creation of federal
deposit insurance and the transformation of S&Ls into severely mismatched
financial intermediaries (borrowing short to lend long) are rooted in the
1930s.
<P>
The first S&L crisis was the industry's interest-rate insolvency that occurred
during the early 1980s when interest rates skyrocketed. That crisis abated by
early 1983, but it left at least 500 insolvent S&Ls in its wake, many of whom,
at the encouragement of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, sold their fixed-rate
mortgages at substantial losses when interest rates were at their peak.
<P>
Because neither the Reagan Administration nor the Congress were willing to face
up to the magnitude of the cost of burying those insolvent S&Ls (I estimate $25
billion in the spring of 1983), the Bank Board left these insolvent
institutions open. Lincoln at that time was at best barely solvent, measured in
terms of its economic value. In many cases, unqualified persons acquired
control of these institutions; Charlie Keating was among the unqualified. The
Bank Board then irresponsibly permitted the managements of these institutions,
including Lincoln's Charlie Keating, to rapidly and recklessly grow them,
utilizing powers Congress has recently granted to S&Ls. So yes, the regulators
did exacerbate the S&L crisis by permitting Charlie Keating and his ilk to
acquire control of, and then to wildly grow, their increasingly insolvent S&Ls,
but the Bank Board's irresponsibility is no excuse for what Charlie did.
<P>
Steve Neal's analysis of how the regulators sank Keating does not wash. The
primary reason real estate values collapsed was because of excessive real
estate development in the 1980s, especially in the Southwest. Eventually, all
asset bubbles collapse, and real estate in the 1980s was no exception. Part of
the overexpansion of real estate was fueled by the excessive liberalization of
real estate depreciation allowances in 1981; part of this overexpansion was
financed by the rapid growth of insured deposits in insolvent and badly managed
banks and S&Ls, including Charlie's Lincoln. The 1986 Tax Reform Act further
depressed real estate values, but this legislation was a much needed reform of
the 1981 tax act; competent real estate developers (we do not include Charlie
in that category) did not get sucked in by the 1981 act and therefore did not
get sucked under by the inevitable collapse of real estate values. The
toughened regulation of S&Ls, which Congress finally enacted in 1989 after
years of dithering and denial, also was a long overdue corrective. In the
aggregate, the collapse of junk bond prices added relatively little to the
overall cost of the S&L fiasco; in any event, S&Ls had no business investing in
junk bonds in the first place. Our friend Charlie was anything but a victim of
the S&L crisis; instead, his incompetency, if not worse, finally caught up with
him. Shed no tears for Charlie.
<P>
As an S&L operator, Charlie failed for the same reason that scores of others
did, albeit on a grander scale. What is unique about Charlie, and why he should
be retried, was American Continental's sale of subordinated debt through the
offices of Lincoln S&L. Charlie, the great battler against sexual pornography,
figuratively raped those Lincoln depositors who were enticed to swap insured
deposits in Lincoln for extremely risky and uninsured subordinated debt issued
by American Continental. While a few other S&Ls and S&L holding companies sold
subordinated debt at the retail level, none went to Charlie's excess. Steve
Neal's legalisms to the contrary, what Charlie did was inexcusable; hopefully,
a court will again find that it was criminal.
<P>


STEPHEN NEAL:<BR>
Bert laces his comments with ad hominem. But he never explains how Keating
caused investor losses, let alone how he violated criminal laws.
<P>
He correctly notes that Keating invested heavily in real estate. But contrary
to Bert's implications, those investments were permitted by regulation, known
to, and approved by, regulators and disclosed to bond purchasers. He correctly
notes that real estate markets have always been cyclical. Keating knew that,
and presumably the government did too when it permitted and encouraged Lincoln
to make real estate investments. 
<P>
What Keating didn't know and couldn't have anticipated was that the government
would change the rules and seize Lincoln as soon as the real estate market
cycled down.
<P>
The government having permitted and encouraged real estate investments, it
should have allowed Lincoln and other savings and loans to hold and manage
their real estate portfolios through the downturn so that investors and
taxpayers would reap the benefits of the inevitable upturn. As we know, that
upturn was fast and dramatic in the Arizona market where Lincoln was most
heavily invested. Unfortunately, the beneficiaries of the upturn were those who
purchased seized assets from the RTC, often with incredibly favorable
financing. The losers were the investors, the taxpayers and Keating.  
<P>
Finally, Bert says savings and loans had no business investing in junk bonds.
That may be his view, although it is puzzling given the performance of the
high-yield bond market over the last decade. But the rules permitted those
investments. 
<P>
I would say equally strongly, that the government has no business using
taxpayer money to insure savings and loan deposits. But despite my view, the
government does just that. I don't presume to think that someone who runs afoul
of my philosophical or economic views should, absent something substantially
more, be subjected to the criminal sanction.
<P>


ELIZABETH CABRASER:<BR>
The government made him do it? Charles Keating, hapless cycle victim? Come on.
He sounds like the poster boy for the tort reform movement. Whatever happened
to personal responsibility, or the quaint notion of fiduciary duty? Bank
robbery is still a crime, whether it's done to a bank, or by it.
<P>
Lincoln Savings' bond scheme was not a highly-prepared Wall Street offering
made to sophisticated investors. It did not occur because tasteless, joking
employees ran amok. It did not happen because passbook savings depositors
suddenly demanded to be placed in highly risky, uninsured investments. The
branch employees didn't go berserk and neither did the depositors. The
employees did as they were told, and the depositors did as they were persuaded.
With everyone at these levels taking full responsibility for their own actions,
that still leaves a culpable party -- the person in charge. Even in a savings
and loan, the buck stops somewhere. It stops with Keating.
<P>
Americans are true believers in personal responsibility. They don't like
whiners or victims. They don't like to hear that it's everything and everybody
else's fault. As between the liar and the lied to, the latter may justifiably
have victim status. The former does not.
<P>
Again, the depositors-turned-bondholders weren't looking for risk; they were
insisting on safety. Their testimony, at the class certification and trial
stages, demonstrated that Lincoln's representatives stressed the safety of the
bonds, going so far as to state that Lincoln's and the parent company's assets
made it stronger than the government in terms of insuring the bonds. Reluctant
or confused depositors were given a hard sell unprecedented in the association
of savings institutions.  They were induced to "own a piece of Lincoln," and to
switch their trust and confidence from government insurance to Lincoln itself.
That, at the very least, is a massive undertaking of fiduciary duty -- a duty
that was then utterly disregarded by Lincoln as it engaged fully in the S&L
speculation of the day. Again, it's about responsibility. Charles Keating had
it.
<P>
I don't like ad hominems either, but it's difficult to refrain given the nature
of the misconduct and the level of audacity that characterize the Lincoln
story. And Charles Keating, whether he likes it now or not, was definitely in
charge. Being a leader involves moral and legal responsibility. Being
responsible means being accountable for decisions and conduct at every level of
the organization. The current tendency by corporations and their leaders to
avoid responsibility and seek immunity from the consequences of their actions
and their products is the most disturbing phenomenon in commerce today,
particularly in contrast to the high degree of trust and regard the public
still places in the corporation that make its products and safeguard its money. 
When a company (let's be charitable) makes a mistake, it is disconcerting at
the least to see a leader who points fingers and looks feverishly for others to
blame.
<P>
Steve Neal has my admiration and respect as an effective advocate.  I dare say
even the Lincoln bondholders could, grudgingly, admire him for his dedication
to his client.  Steve Neal is a wonderful lawyer, but Charles Keating will
never star in a remake of "It's a Wonderful Life."

IRA RAPHAELSON:<BR>
I agree with Ms. Cabraser when she says that Mr. Keating was no victim and had a fine lawyer. When Mr. Keating and his son were convicted by a federal jury on 1/6/93, that jury found him guilty of all 77 counts of an indictment that charged racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property, misapplication of funds and securities fraud. The indictment charged Mr. Keating and four other officer/directors of Lincoln Savings and its parent American Continental Corp. (ACC) with engaging in a pattern of racketeering to obtain money from and through Lincoln. This activity included five alleged schemes: a scheme to create sham profits for ACC and Lincoln through fraudulent sales of undeveloped land and other assets; a scheme to sell ACC bonds through Lincoln's branch network, based in part on the sham profits; a scheme to transfer money illegally from Lincoln to ACC through an inter-company "tax sharing agreement"; a scheme to use Lincoln's money and property to bail ACC out of a costly contractual obligation; and a scheme to transfer money from ACC to the defendants and members of their families through sham loans from an ACC subsidiary while ACC was preparing to declare bankruptcy. 
<P>
During the trial, Mr. Keating took the stand in his own defense, claiming, as Mr. Neal has repeated, that he was victimized by bureaucrats and prosecutors. According to press reports after the verdict, the jury simply did not believe him. Rather, as one juror explained, "We all felt we would have liked to have one of those expanding noses that grows longer and longer.... We just didn't think any of it was valid." 
<P>
Another indication that Mr. Keating was not simply victimized is the irrefutable fact that eight defendants pled guilty. Some testified as to his intent to defraud regarding the flipping of loans for property whose value had been falsely inflated to fraudulently overstate the worth of the S&L. Judith Wischer, former ACC President and Keating's right hand, pled and so testified. Also pleading were the former CFO of ACC, a former Senior VP who was Keating's son-in-law, Lincoln's CEO and Board Chairman, two former Lincoln Presidents including one who also served as ACC VP, an ACC attorney and an Arizona land developer. These facts hardly support the notions that Mr. Keating lacked intent or was a victim in this matter.
<P>
The thrust of the Justice Department's prosecutive undertaking was not to lend credence to bad regulation or poor public policy by Congress. Rather 5,500 persons were convicted between 1988 and 1995 at a 95% conviction rate of defrauding financial institutions. The evidence presented in the Lincoln case, verified through guilty pleas by its officers and attorney was that Lincoln lied about the value of its assets to keep the piggy bank open for Mr. Keating and his associates to enrich themselves. This is not an original type of criminal activity, but it is criminal nonetheless. Those who run financial institutions with taxpayer backing have legally imposed fiduciary duties to protect those assets for the public and not to enrich themselves and their cronies or relatives.
<P>
One additional theme identified during the S&L prosecutions and in the Presidential Commission's Report on the Thrift Crisis in 1993 was that deregulation of the thrifts brought CD brokering, junk bonds and commercial real estate investment on an unprecedented scale to lending institutions that lacked the expertise to engage in any appropriate due diligence. When the investments went bad, as they were destined to do, many of those who sought to conceal their own failures as financial managers turned to "Ponzi"-like schemes to conceal the loss of book value. Resulting loan and land flips led to mounting losses and the size of the crisis simply grew.
<P>

PETER SCHEER:<BR>
Ira, please describe for us the strongest evidence the federal government had of criminal fraud by Keating personally. Also, would the government have proceeded criminally against Keating if he had not sold the high-risk bonds to depositors -- in other words, would the case have been criminal if the government, through the deposit insurance, had been the only real victim of the bank's investments?
<P>
IRA RAPHAELSON:<BR>
My original comment is not meant to suggest that merely because the DOJ convicted a lot of people that Keating was guilty as charged. The jury found him so with all deference to the Ninth Circuit, and the conviction was supported by substantial evidence of self-dealing. Nor is the mere fact that eight other officers and affiliated parties pled to the same crimes mean necessarily that Keating "knew" what he was doing was wrong. However, to suggest as Keating and his lawyer have maintained that he is victim of anything in this is to overstate the case. Mr. Keating unquestionably caused the loss of significant amounts of money to the public and to private persons. He neither was nor is entitled to keep the profits of his activity in that regard. Whether there is a retrial of the federal case or not, Mr. Keating has had his days in court. As to the federal charging decision, it is impossible to parse someone else's prosecutive decision. I can only say that on the evidence then available, I would have concurred in charging, even if the bond-sale evidence were not available.
<P>
PETER SCHEER:<BR>
Elizabeth, Steve makes the point that Keating's sale of subordinated debt to depositors of his bank was legal at the time and approved by state and federal regulators. If correct, that's a powerful argument against criminal prosecution of Keating. It's one thing to say that Keating should be civilly liable to his investors for their losses. But wasn't it a stretch for the government to prosecute him under these circumstances?
<P>
<A HREF=index.html#cabra>ELIZABETH CABRASER</A>:<BR>
Not necessarily. The sale itself might arguably have been legal and approved, but criminal conduct could still occur if the promotion and sale of the investments was conducted through a course of conduct that operated as a fraud upon investors and/or the regulatory process. As we all know, what is done and said, while perfectly legal and above board, may be rendered fraudulent -- and even criminal -- if accompanied by non-disclosure or concealment of material facts, or other fraudulent conduct.

IRA RAPHAELSON:<BR>
The literal truth / good faith defense to federal fraud charges is absolute but not without its limitations. I agree with Ms. Cabraser's conclusion but for slightly different analytical reasons. A good faith belief in the bona fides of a venture as a whole does not justify false statements made in support of that venture. As I understand the evidence, not all statements made by the salesmen were true. Indeed, I recall some evidence that suggested that salesmen were coached to distort the distinction between ACC (uninsured) and Lincoln (insured) paper. Additionally, federal fraud law separately punishes material omissions frauds -- that is where there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties, material facts may not be concealed, even if the statements made are literally true, but materially incomplete. This is a distinct basis for criminal liability often seen in the securities arena. To the extent that the salesmen failed to inform investors that the paper sold in the lobby of a federally insured institution was not itself insured, a material omissions case may indeed be argued.
<P>
STEVE NEAL:<BR>
I appreciate Elizabeth's and Ira's nice comments about me as a lawyer. I hold them both in high esteem. But they are wrong about Keating and Lincoln.
<P>
I do agree with Elizabeth's comment about personal responsibility. Charlie Keating always has been willing to accept it. Too many others have not been so willing. 
<P>
The government not only permitted but encouraged Keating to grow Lincoln rapidly in size and to diversify its investments into real estate, hotels and other non-traditional assets. When the real estate markets dipped, Keating was prepared to work through and survive the downturn. The government wasn't.
<P>
Federal and state regulators not only permitted but encouraged the sale of ACC bonds through Lincoln branches. When government policies caused, or at a minimum aggravated, a downturn in the real estate values largely underlying those bonds, Keating was prepared to accept responsibility and make good on the bonds. But the government stripped him of his ability to do so.
<P>
Ira correctly identifies the main theories of prosecution in the federal criminal case. The overriding theory was that the reported profits of ACC and Lincoln were phony, inflated through "sham" transactions. But the only accounting witness called by prosecutors in the federal case -- no accounting witness was called by the prosecution in the state case -- testified that even with all of the evidence about supposedly "sham" transactions, she could not conclude that the profits of ACC/Lincoln were overstated by even one nickel. Despite the jury verdict, that evidence is, presumably, the reason why the Ninth Circuit has ruled that the evidence of guilt was "not overwhelming." Whether that court would ultimately rule that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict may never be known unless the prosecutors appeal the new trial order. 
<P>
The second main theme of the federal case involved what Ira, and the prosecutors themselves, characterized as "illegal" tax-sharing payments from Lincoln to ACC. The problem with that theory, despite the jury verdict, is that the supposedly "illegal" payments were made pursuant to, and in exact conformance with, an explicit, written tax-sharing agreement between Lincoln and ACC that was approved and signed by federal regulators. The federal regulators later termed their approval a mistake. But rather than accept responsibility for their mistake, those regulators encouraged that tax-sharing agreement to become a cornerstone in the prosecution of Keating, who had complied fully with the terms of the agreement.
<P>
PETER SCHEER:<BR>
Steve, you seem to be saying that the government, having induced S&Ls to expand into risky real estate and junk bond investments in the mid-80s, should have refrained from taking over the insolvent thrifts, and selling off those assets, in the late 1980s. That's easy to say with 20-20 hindsight; we know that those assets eventually recovered in value. But in 1988 and 1989 that was not a sure thing. The government was facing a huge and exponentially growing liability to insured depositors. Surely, it is appropriate for the government to take action to stem those losses. It isn't required to "time" the market perfectly.
<P>
STEPHEN NEAL:<BR>
Whether, regardless of deregulation, it was appropriate for the government to take action to stem losses, the answer in the abstract must be yes. But in reality, the "losses" here were short-term market downturns -- like those that happen all the time in the stock market. When the government deregulated, it knew savings and loans would be investing in somewhat volatile assets. It should have had a sounder plan than to panic at the first downturn, seize assets, mark them down to market and then dump them. The contrast between the handling of savings and loans on the one hand and commercial banks with large real estate portfolios on the other hand is most instructive. In the latter case, the bank regulators -- a different crew than the savings and loan regulators -- did not seize institutions, aggressively mark down the value of their assets and then fire-sell those assets. Instead the regulators showed forbearance and patience while waiting for the inevitable upturn, even though its magnitude and timing they could not predict with precision.
<P>
Charlie Keating was and remains willing to accept responsibility for his own acts. But he should not have been subjected to unconstitutional imprisonment because of irrational and erratic conduct by people over whom he had no control.

IRA RAPHAELSON:<BR>
The literal truth / good faith defense to federal fraud charges is absolute but not without its limitations. I agree with Ms. Cabraser's conclusion but for slightly different analytical reasons. A good faith belief in the bona fides of a venture as a whole does not justify false statements made in support of that venture. As I understand the evidence, not all statements made by the salesmen were true. Indeed, I recall some evidence that suggested that salesmen were coached to distort the distinction between ACC (uninsured) and Lincoln (insured) paper. Additionally, federal fraud law separately punishes material omissions frauds -- that is where there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties, material facts may not be concealed, even if the statements made are literally true, but materially incomplete. This is a distinct basis for criminal liability often seen in the securities arena. To the extent that the salesmen failed to inform investors that the paper sold in the lobby of a federally insured institution was not itself insured, a material omissions case may indeed be argued.
<P>
STEVE NEAL:<BR>
I appreciate Elizabeth's and Ira's nice comments about me as a lawyer. I hold them both in high esteem. But they are wrong about Keating and Lincoln.
<P>
I do agree with Elizabeth's comment about personal responsibility. Charlie Keating always has been willing to accept it. Too many others have not been so willing. 
<P>
The government not only permitted but encouraged Keating to grow Lincoln rapidly in size and to diversify its investments into real estate, hotels and other non-traditional assets. When the real estate markets dipped, Keating was prepared to work through and survive the downturn. The government wasn't.
<P>
Federal and state regulators not only permitted but encouraged the sale of ACC bonds through Lincoln branches. When government policies caused, or at a minimum aggravated, a downturn in the real estate values largely underlying those bonds, Keating was prepared to accept responsibility and make good on the bonds. But the government stripped him of his ability to do so.
<P>
Ira correctly identifies the main theories of prosecution in the federal criminal case. The overriding theory was that the reported profits of ACC and Lincoln were phony, inflated through "sham" transactions. But the only accounting witness called by prosecutors in the federal case -- no accounting witness was called by the prosecution in the state case -- testified that even with all of the evidence about supposedly "sham" transactions, she could not conclude that the profits of ACC/Lincoln were overstated by even one nickel. Despite the jury verdict, that evidence is, presumably, the reason why the Ninth Circuit has ruled that the evidence of guilt was "not overwhelming." Whether that court would ultimately rule that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict may never be known unless the prosecutors appeal the new trial order. 
<P>
The second main theme of the federal case involved what Ira, and the prosecutors themselves, characterized as "illegal" tax-sharing payments from Lincoln to ACC. The problem with that theory, despite the jury verdict, is that the supposedly "illegal" payments were made pursuant to, and in exact conformance with, an explicit, written tax-sharing agreement between Lincoln and ACC that was approved and signed by federal regulators. The federal regulators later termed their approval a mistake. But rather than accept responsibility for their mistake, those regulators encouraged that tax-sharing agreement to become a cornerstone in the prosecution of Keating, who had complied fully with the terms of the agreement.

 The man who symbolized the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s is free -- a federal judge has 
 overturned Charles Keating Jr's 1993 racketeering, conspiracy and fraud convictions.  But is Keating innocent?
 Listen in as a panel of experts, including Keating's lawyer and prosecutor, discuss the Keating
 affair.

[Editor's Note: U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in
Washington, D.C. rejected a merger settlement between West
Publishing Co. and Thomson Publishing, Inc. The U.S. Department of
Justice and antitrust enforcers from seven states had endorsed the
consent decree that required  West and Thomson to divest 51 print
products and the Auto Cite electronic citation system, and to
license West's book and page number system. Friedman found the
decree "in the public interest, but for one provision" -- the page
number licensing:  "The court suggests that the public interest
would be served if West and Thomson would agree to amend the
license provision in the proposed final judgment's [pagination
license] to provide a free license to all who request one until
West's copyright claim is judicially resolved once and for all."]

Civil Action No. 96-1415 (PLF)


OPINION

The United States and seven states filed suit under the
federal antitrust laws to prevent the acquisition of West
Publishing Company by The Thomson Corporation. Plaintiffs
have now moved
for entry of a Final Judgment and defendants have consented
to its entry. The Court must determine whether the proposed
Final Judgment is in the "public interest" under the
Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16
(the "Tunney Act"). After thoroughly reviewing the briefs
and other materials submitted by the parties and amicus
curiae Lexis-Nexis, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc., and
Hyper Law, Inc., and the 26 public comments submitted to
the Department of Justice, and carefully considering the
arguments presented at the Tunney Act hearing before the
Court, the Court finds that the Proposed Final Judgment is
in the public interest but for one provision.1/


I. BACKGROUND

A. The Complaint

On June 19, 1996, the United States, through the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice, along
with the States of California, Connecticut, Illinois,
Massachusetts, New York, Washington and Wisconsin filed a
lawsuit under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec.
18, against The Thomson Corporation and West Publishing
Company, the largest and third largest publishers of law
books and legal research materials in the United States, to
prevent the proposed acquisition of West by Thomson.

The complaint alleged that the acquisition would reduce
competition in the markets in which Thomson and West are
direct competitors, specifically, in nine "enhanced primary 
law markets, 47 secondary law products' markers,
and the comprehensive online legal research market. Noting
that Thomson and West are the only print publishers of nine
enhanced Codes or case law reporters and two of a very few
publishers of a number of competing secondary law products,
plaintiffs alleged that the elimination of competition
between the two companies would, in all likelihood,
increase prices and reduce quality in these markets.
Plaintiffs also alleged that the acquisition is likely to
reduce competition in the provision of comprehensive online
legal research services by reducing Thomson's incentives to
continue providing certain products, including its
electronic case law citation service, known as Auto-Cite,
to Lexis-Nexis, at the current levels of price and quality.
Lexis-Nexis depends upon its access to some of Thomson's
products, including Auto-Cite, to compete effectively
against the only other online legal research service,
WestLaw, which is owned by West.

The nine enhanced primary law markets that are the subject
of the complaint are the United States Code, United States
Supreme Court case law, the California Code, California
case law, the Massachusetts Code, the Michigan Code, the
New York Code, Washington case law and Wisconsin case law.
West and Thomson publish competing so-called "enhanced"
products in these markets; in some markets they are the
only publishers of such products. These enhanced products
differ from other legal research products because they
contain not only the Code or case law for the jurisdiction
but also headnotes, summaries and/or annotations;
unenhanced Codes and case law publications therefore are
not substitutes for them.

With respect to these enhanced products, Thomson and West
have been each other's closest competitors and, according
to the complaint, the acquisition of West by Thomson
would substantially increase concentration in these markets
and create or exacerbate barriers to entry by other
potential competitors. The complaint describes with some
specificity the difficulties encountered by new entrants
that reduce competition in these markets. To be successful,
for example, a new entrant would require access to past and
current court opinions and statutes that may not be
available from the courts themselves or whose acquisition
would be costly and time-consuming. In addition, a highly
skilled editorial staff would be needed to create the case
notes, summaries and annotations that are currently
produced by West or Thomson. See Complaint Para. 30-31.
Several commentators also worried that such staff will be
difficult to obtain.

Finally, and of particular importance, West has long
claimed that it has a copyright in what is commonly
referred to as "star pagination," the insertion of numeric
symbols in the text of decisions to indicate the equivalent
West reporter page break and page number. Star pagination
permits an individual to rely on a printed decision not
published by West while retaining the ability to cite to
the West's National Reporter System. This ability is
critical because citations to West's National Reporter
System are commonly required or expected by courts and
therefore are a pervasive part of legal practice and
research wherever West publishes a reporter for a
jurisdiction. Yet West maintains that anyone who uses or
copies its "star pagination" is infringing its copyright.
Thus, existing or potential participants in the market for
primary law products cannot offer products with star
pagination without the threat of costly copyright
infringement litigation. In fact, the complaint cites star
pagination as an anticompetitive factor in all three areas
of concern: primary enhanced law markets, secondary
enhanced law products and, indirectly, online research.
Complaint Paras. 32, 43, 52.

Thomson and West also compete directly with each other for
print and/or CD-ROM sales of national and state secondary
law products, including treatises and practice and
procedure materials, in a number of markets. The complaint
alleged that because Thomson and West compete directly over
price product quality and product innovation for numerous
secondary law products, a combination of the two companies
would eliminate this competition, raise prices and reduce
quality. In addition, it alleged that West's star
pagination copyright infringement claim would chill
potential entry into these markets and harm competition
because secondary law products rely on the ability to cite
to the West National Reporter System. Complaint Para. 43.

Online legal research services permit subscribers, using
software, to access and navigate large databases containing
primary and secondary law products; such services also
provide access and cross-references to myriad other legal
and non-legal resources. Because online legal research is
fast, flexible and comprehensive, print versions of the law
and full text and word searching of primary law on CD-ROMs
are not adequate substitutes for online services, nor is
the Internet. Complaint Paras. 50-52. Lexis-Nexis and
WestLaw (owned by West) are the two largest comprehensive
online legal research services. They are direct competitors
and their products are substitutes for one another.
According to the complaint, no other competitor currently
exists or is likely to enter this market. Complaint Para.
58.

West places its own primary and secondary law products on
WestLaw, while Lexis-Nexis places its own and third party
materials, including some Thomson enhanced primary and
secondary law products on its service. Primary among these
is Auto-Cite, which is used to gather negative commentary
on a case and quickly determines the case history for use
in correct citation. Thomson licenses Auto-Cite, as well as
certain non-legal database including Investext, ASAP and
Predicasts, to Lexis-Nexis.2/

The complaint predicted that the acquisition of West by
Thomson would harm competition in the market for
comprehensive online legal research services by encouraging
Thomson to increase prices, reduce quality and innovation,
and/or withhold access to a number of products it now
licenses to Lexis-Nexis, including Auto-Cite. This conduct
would materially injure Lexis-Nexis's ability to compete
effectively with the comprehensive online legal research
services of the merged company. Furthermore, the complaint
alleged that in the event of such exercise of market power
by Thomson, Lexis-Nexis would be unable or unlikely to
replace the licensed Thomson products so as to maintain the
pre-merger level of competition in the comprehensive online
legal service market.3/

In conjunction with their complaint, plaintiffs filed a
Proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement,
and a Stipulation and proposed Order under which the
defendants agreed to abide by and comply with the
provisions of the Proposed Final Judgment pending its entry
by the Court. Judge Richey, to whom this case initially was
assigned, entered the Stipulation and Order on June 19,
1996. Under the terms of the Proposed Final Judgment.
Thomson would be permitted to complete its acquisition of
West in return for divesting itself of certain assets,
licensing star pagination, giving certain third parties the
option to extend various third party licenses, and giving
certain states the option to terminate their contracts with
West or Thomson. Plaintiffs, West and Thomson now assert
that the Proposed Final Judgment will sufficiently
ameliorate the anticompetitive effects of the merger
identified in the complaint.

According to the Competitive Impact Statement, the Proposed
Final Judgment will preserve competition in the nine
enhanced primary law markets by requiring Thomson/West to
divest itself of one enhanced Code product for each of the
following jurisdictions: the United States, California,
Michigan and New York, and by requiring divestiture of
United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition, a
Supreme Court case law reporter. The Proposed Final
Judgment also permits three states -- California,
Washington and Wisconsin -- to reopen the bidding on the
contracts to publish the official state reporter, allowing
these states tO cause a divestiture of their state's
reporter products if they so choose. The Proposed Final
Judgment further requires that one secondary law product in
each of the secondary law markets identified in the
complaint be divested. In addition, Thomson would be
required to divest itself of Auto-Cite and extend the terms
of existing licenses of Investext, ASAP and Predicasts to
Lexis-Nexis. Finally, Thomson/West would be required to
license the use of star pagination in the National Reporter
System to any legal publisher desiring such a license,
notwithstanding West's copyright claim to star pagination.


B. Procedural History

The Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact
Statement and a summary of the terms of the Proposed Final
Judgment and directions for the submission of written
comments relating to the Proposed Final Judgment were
published in the Federal Register on July 5, 1996, as well
as in the Washington Post. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(b) and
(c). The 60-day period for public comments expired on
September 3, 1996 and, as of September 23, 1996, plaintiffs
had received comments from 26 persons or entities. On
September 23, 1996, the United States, joined by six of the
seven state plaintiffs, filed with the Court their Response
to Public Comments. Plaintiffs published that Response in
the Federal Register on October 11, 1996. See 61 Fed. Reg
, 53386; 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(d).[4/] On September 24, 1996,
Thomson and West filed their Response to Public Comments
with the Court. The Court therefore finds that the
government has complied with all the procedural
requirements of the Tunney Act.

On July 31, 1996, Judge Richey denied the motion of Tax
Analysts to intervene or to participate as amicus curiae in
this matter.5/ On September 25, 1996, the Court entered a
Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the motion of
Lexis-Nexis to intervene in this matter but granting the
alternative motion of Lexis-Nexis to appear as amicus
curiae and-to participate in the Tunney Act hearing The
Court also granted the motion of Hyper Law, Inc. to
participate as amicus curiae by filing a brief, but it
declined to permit Hyper Law to participate in the hearing.
On that same day, the Court denied the motions of CD Law,
Inc., Taxpayer Assets Project and Versus Law to participate
as amicus curiae. On September 3O, 1996, the Court held an
extended hearing, at which it heard argument from counsel
for the United States, the state plaintiffs, Thomson and
West, and Lexis-Nexis.

On October 9, 1996, the Court entered an order granting
Hyper Law's motion for leave to file its amicus curiae
brief with certain time restrictions, denying Taxpayer
Assets Project's motion for reconsideration of the denial
of its motion to participate as amicus curiae, granting the
motion of Lexis-Nexis for leave to file the declarations of
certain law librarians, and granting the motion of
Lexis-Nexis to file a supplemental brief on two of the
numerous issues on which it sought leave to be heard
further: (1) whether the entry of the Proposed Final
Judgment would constitute a "taking" of Lexis-Nexis'
property without just compensation in violation of the
Fifth Amendment; and (2) "any new argument and information
with respect to its concerns about the assurances provided
by West and Thomson regarding the citation of ALR as part
of Auto-Cite, assuming there is anything new to add to what
already has been submitted."6/

On October 23, 1996, plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of
a revised Proposed Final Judgment, a memorandum in support
of that motion, and a revised Proposed Final Judgment. The
post-hearing revisions agreed to by the parties and now
proposed to the Court are as follows:


1. Section 3.01 of Exhibit B to the Final Judgment, the
star pagination license, would be amended to delete the
clause, "(i) shall respect and not contest the validity of
the copyrights claimed by Licensor in Licensor's
arrangements of case reports in NRS Reporters as expressed
by NRS Pagination; and (ii)." The purpose of this revision
is to eliminate the contractual restriction on a licensee
not to contest the validity of the star pagination
copyright claimed by West during the term of the license.

2. Paragraph II.B of the Final Judgment would be revised to
add after "the assignment of the Auto-Cite License
Agreement," a new clause: "if permitted by contract or
otherwise the transfer of the economic benefits. equivalent
to those received by Thomson under the Auto-Cite License
Agreement."

3. A new paragraph IV.H. would be added to the Final
Judgment that would read: "Defendants shall not claim or
assert any right to prohibit an Acquirer from including in
any of the Divestiture Products or any other publications
cross-references to the Defendant's products of the type
contained in Thomson's Total Client Service Library
("TCSL") or Integrated Legal Research System ("ILRS").
Defendants shall not claim or assert any right to prohibit
an Acquirer from including in Auto-Cite cross-references to
Thomson's American Law Reports or other annotations of the
type that are now included in Auto-Cite."

4. In Paragraph II.B. the word "sublicensable" would be
added to the description of the license associated with the
divested copy of the historical Auto-Cite database. The
original phrase "delivery of a transferrable royalty-free
perpetual license of the Auto-Cite database" would now read
"delivery of a transferrable sublicensable royalty-free
perpetual license of the Auto-Cite database." The purpose
of this revision is to make clear that the acquirer of
Auto-Cite can sublicense the database.


II. DISCUSSION

A. Tunney Act Proceedings

The responsibility of the district court and the proper
scope of its "public interest" inquiry in a Tunney Act
proceeding were spelled out most recently by our court of
appeals in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448
(D.C. Cir. 1995). The court made plain that the district
court should not second guess the prosecutorial decisions
of the Antitrust Division regarding the nature or scope of
the claims brought in the first instance. Rather, the court
is to compare the complaint filed by the government with
the proposed consent decree and determine whether the
remedies negotiated between the parties and proposed by the
Justice Department clearly and effectively address the
anticompetitive harms initially identified. In other words,
the court "may not reach beyond the complaint to evaluate
claims that the government did not make." 56 F.3d at 1459.
See also United States v. American Telephone and Telegraph
Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982), judgment aff'd,
Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983).

On the other hand, the Court is not merely a "judicial
rubber stamp[]"; it is required to make "an independent
determination as to whether or not entry of a proposed
consent decree is in the public interest." United States v.
Microsoft Corp., 53 F.3d at 1458 (quoting H.R. REP. No.
1463, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1974) ("House Report"), and S.
REP. No. 298, 93d Cong. 1st Sess. 5 (1974) ("Senate
Report"), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6535, 6538, 6539).
In making this determination, the Tunney Act provides that
the Court "may consider--"


(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including
termination of alleged violations, provisions for
enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought,
anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually
considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the
adequacy of such judgment;

(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public
generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint


15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(e); see United States v. Microsoft Corp.,
56 F.3d at 1458.

The D.C. Circuit has focused on several factors that are
particularly important for a court to consider in the
exercise of its discretion. In particular, the court should
"hesitate" in the face of specific objections from directly
affected third parties before concluding that a proposed
final judgment is in the public interest. United States v.
Microsoft Corp, 56 F.3d at 1462; see 15 U.S. C. Sec. 16(e).
The court should pay "special attention" to the clarity of
the proposed consent decree and to the adequacy of its
compliance mechanisms in order to assure that the decree is
sufficiently precise and the compliance mechanisms
sufficiently effective to enable the court to manage the
implementation of the consent decree and resolve any
subsequent disputes United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56
F.3d at 1461-62.

While the focus of the public interest inquiry, of course,
is on "the issue of competition and the effects on
competition" posed by a proposed merger "which are at the
heart of the antitrust laws, . . . other factors are not
irrelevant." United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150;
see id. at 149 n.77 "[T]he Court may at the relief stage
prohibit practices which have not been found unlawful if
such prohibition is necessary to avoid the recurrence of
monopolization," id. at 150 n.80, and "may consider factors
other than [the consent decree's] effect on competition."
Id. at 150 n .81. See House Report at 11-12 (deletion of
the words "as defined by law" that formerly modified
"public interest" was done as a recognition that the
content of the phrase, 'public interest,' is a product of
judicial construction" and that to have defined "public
interest" solely in terms of antitrust law would have been
too narrow). For example, "the Court would be justified in
rejecting the proposed decree or requiring its modification
if it concluded that the decree unnecessarily conflicts
with important public policies other than the polic[ies]
embodied in the [antitrust laws]." United States v. AT&T,
552 F. Supp. at 151; see also id. at 151 n.83.

Above all, the consent decree and Proposed Final Judgment
are the products of a negotiated settlement from which,
presumably, no party obtained everything it wanted. Thus,
"remedies which appear less than vigorous may well reflect
an underlying weakness in the government's case," or an
assessment made after extensive investigation, the details
of which are not before the court, that more could not
likely have been achieved by a trial, or merely a
legitimate cost of settlement in lieu of trial. United
States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1460-61. According
due deference to the "government's predictions as to the
effect of the proposed remedies," id. at 1461, the district
court is not to determine on its own authority what "best
serves society" but, rather, whether the proposal presented
to it is "within the reaches of the public interest."
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1460 (quoting
United States v. Western Electric Corp., 900 F.2d 283, 309
(D.C. Cir. 1990), and United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648
F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083
(1981)).

The Court concludes that the Proposed Final Judgment in
this case -- as modified by the parties in response to the
public comments, the tenacity of Lexis-Nexis, and the
persuasiveness of the Reporter of Decisions in California
and others, as well as to the concerns expressed by the
Court at the Tunney Act hearing -- is in the public
interest except for the star pagination license provision.
The consent decree is not ambiguous and appears to pose no
serious difficulties in implementation. United States v.
Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1461-62. After the clarifying
language agreed to by the parties and the revisions
proposed following the Tunney Act hearing, the Court is
persuaded that the Proposed Final Judgment adequately
addresses all but one of the anticompetitive claims raised
by the complaint and therefore is in the public interest
with one, albeit very important exception.7/


B. Divestiture

The primary negotiated remedy for the anticompetitive
aspects of the merger proposed to the Court is divestiture
of certain publications now owned by Thomson companies.8/
Several commentators expressed concern, however, that the
publications slated for divestiture under the Proposed
Final Judgment will not remain viable unless additional
products and rights also are divested. Others maintain that
the divestiture of competing products is not sufficient and
that entire subsidiary companies of Thomson must be
divested instead.

The Court concludes that the remedies structured by the
Department of Justice sufficiently assure that the divested
products will remain viable, recognizing the inherent
uncertainty in such predictions. Acquirers of divested
products will receive all production assets of the divested
products, including their intellectual property, work in
progress, plates, films, master tapes, machine readable
codes for CD-ROM production, existing inventory,
correspondence and files, a copy of the current subscriber
list and related subscriber information, advertising
materials, contracts with authors, software and, at the
acquirers' option, computers and other physical assets. See
Proposed Final Judgment Para. II.B. In addition, Thomson
must provide transition production of the acquired products
on behalf of the acquirers for a reasonable period of time
and at a reasonable price. See Proposed Final Judgment
Para. IV.C. Thomson/West may not interfere with any
negotiations by acquirers to make offers of employment to
Thomson/West employees whose primary responsibility is the
production. sale or marketing of divested products, and the
Justice Department has found ample evidence of the
availability of trained editorial staff outside of
Thomson/West. Indeed, many of the potential buyers already
possess editorial staff and publishing infrastructure. See
Proposed Final Judgment Para. IV.F. Thomson/West must
preserve the divested products until divestiture is made
and cannot reassign employees to avoid their being hired by
acquirers. Proposed Final Judgment Paras. VIII.A-C.
Finally, all divestitures are subject to the approval of
the United States after consultation with the state
plaintiffs, and divestiture of state specific products are
subject to the approval of both the United States and the
appropriate state plaintiff. See Proposed Final Judgment
Para. IV.B. With these provisions in the Final Judgment,
the government was reasonable in concluding, after a
thorough investigation, that the divested products will
attract strong, capable buyers who will be able to ensure
the viability of the products they acquire.

Some of the public comments argued that preservation of
competition in secondary law products markets would require
divestiture not merely of individual publications but of
entire Thomson subsidiary companies. Arguing that the focus
on individual products is itself analytically flawed, these
comments asserted that products within the West and Thomson
cross-referencing systems are interdependent and that no
single product could effectively or meaningfully be
extricated, that the companies' brand names carry goodwill
and recognition without which individual products will
falter, that Thomson products benefit from economies of
scale that will be lost upon divestiture, and finally that
cross-references to other Thompson products cannot
effectively be reproduced by non-Thomson companies that
lack access to the editorial staff and resources of other
Thomson publications. By contrast, the government found
that competition between individual West and Thomson
products is based primarily on substantive content in the
publications, including their differing enhancements and
cross-references, and that the valuable cross-referencing
would continue regardless of the ownership of the
publication. See Plaintiffs' Response to Public Comments at
12, 16.

The commentators, including Lexis-Nexis, rely in part for
this argument on the assertion that acquirers of divested
products will either no longer be permitted to
cross-reference Thomson's other products or will be
dependent on Thomson for those cross-references. Defendants
in turn assert that acquirers would be free to cross-cite
without interference from Thomson of any kind or the
payment of any fee for the right to cross-reference. The
government found no proprietary barriers to
cross-referencing to Thomson products, since Thomson has
never objected to cross-references to its products by other
publishers, claimed a proprietary interest in such
cross-references or charged a royalty for them. Rather, the
government reasoned that such cross-referencing would be in
Thomson's interests, and Thomson confirmed in writing that
it will continue its practice of open citation to its Total
Client Service Library ("TCSL") products after the merger.
See Letter from Thomson Corporation to U.S. Department of
Justice (Sept. 18, 1996), Tab 4, Defendants' Response to
Public Comments.

In order to remove any doubt about the ability of acquirers
to cross-cite to products retained by Thomson, following
the Tunney Act hearing the parties agreed to incorporate a
specific provision -- Paragraph IV.H -- into the Final
Judgment that reads as follows:


Defendants shall not claim or assert any right to prohibit
an Acquirer from including in any of the Divestiture
Products or any other publications cross -references to the
Defendant's products of the type contained in Thomson's
Total Client Service Library ("TCSL") or Integrated Legal
Research System ("ILRS"). Defendants shall not claim or
assert any right to prohibit an Acquirer from including, in
Auto-Cite cross-references to Thomson's American Law
Reports or other annotations of the type that are now
included in Auto-Cite.


In view of this revision of the decree, the Court concludes
that Thomson will not be able to undermine divestiture
products by withholding cross-cites or extracting fees from
acquirers for cross-citing.

Furthermore, after an extensive investigation -- which
included the subpoena of documents from defendants,
depositions of employees and officers of defendants, and
interviews of law librarians, competing legal publishers
and other legal publishing industry participants -- the
government concluded that divestiture of entire companies
was not necessary in order to preserve acquirers' ability
to cross-reference individual products. The government
found that there was "relatively little evidence of joint
production of Thomson products," Plaintiffs' Response to
Public Comments at 7, and that cross-referenced individual
products therefore could be effectively maintained by
non-Thomson entities. While this conclusion is less well
supported on the record before the Court (the government
provides just one sentence in its response to this
particular concern, see Plaintiffs' Response to Public
Comments at 7), in view of the extensive provisions in the
Proposed Final Judgment designed to ensure viability and
the deference due to the governments' factual findings in
this regard, the Court accepts the government's
representation that acquirers will be able to reproduce
cross-references to Thomson products as effectively as
Thomson has been able to do in the past.

With respect to the concern that certain brand names carry
valuable goodwill and that brand names are important to a
divestiture product's viability, the Proposed Final
Judgment includes the divestiture of what the Justice
Department concluded were the most important such brand
names, for example. Deering's Annotated California Code,
Corbin on Contracts, and United States Supreme Court
Reports, Lawyers' Edition. See Proposed Final Judgment,
Exhibit A.1; Plaintiffs' Response to Public Comments at 16.
The Court accepts as reasonable the government's finding
that the divestiture of other brand names is unnecessary to
maintain competition in the identified markets.

Several commentators maintained that Thomson/West should be
required to divest themselves of either Thomson's American
Jurisprudence ("AmJur") series or West's Corpus Juris
Secundum ("CJS") because the merger would eliminate
competition between the two. The Department of Justice
investigated whether the combination of these products
would lessen competition in some relevant market and
concluded that, although AmJur and CJS are both national
legal encyclopedias, they cannot meaningfully be said to be
competing products. As Professor Robert C. Berring
explained:


Each of these sets is called a national legal encyclopedia
but they are hardly in competition. Corpus Juris Secundum
(CJS) was authored in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of the
volumes are still original. When it was written, its goal
was to be a comprehensive explanation of all cases on all
topics.... This mission became impossible as the avalanche
of new cases grew larger. Rather than change or redo the
set, West decided just to keep producing pocket parts for
it. The volume on Monopolies is a great example. It is
fifty years old. It has an eighty page pocket part. There
is no possible way that the pocket part could bring the set
up to date. If West had wanted to keep the set truly
relevant they [sic] would have had to issue a third
revision starting in the eighties.... West did not, and the
decision was probably wise. The comprehensive approach is
simply unmanageable these days. For many who work in the
field CJS is thus a pretty much dead set.

AmJur 2d was produced in the 1970s. It is not an attempt to
explain everything it is instead, an attempt to give
background on major topics with lots of references. It is
written in a more readable style. Some academics criticize
it for trying to oversimplify, but that is its mission. It
is a great place to send college students who want some
background, or a lawyer who is entering new subject areas.
But it should never be cited as authority. It is deep
background. It gives citations to cases, the TCSL and ALR
annotations that might provide more depth, but it is
largely explanatory .

Thus I see CJS as an attempt to provide a tool for lawyers
that has been largely abandoned, and AmJur 2d as a general
tool for those needing some background that is very much
alive.


Affidavit of Robert C. Berring Para. 3 Apr. 29, 1996), Ex.
6 to Thomson's and West's Response to Public Comments. The
government was entitled to rely on presentations of such
quality in concluding that CJS is not a strong competitor
with AmJur2d. See United States v. Microsoft Corp, 56 F.3d
at 1461.

Furthermore, while West has not released CJS as a CD-ROM
product and has no plans to do so, AmJur is one of
Thomson's best-selling CD-ROM products. In view of the
insignificant demand for CJS and the lack of meaningful
competition between the two products, the government
reasonably decided to omit any claim from its complaint
that the common ownership of these two products would
threaten competition in violation of the Clayton Act. Given
the absence of such a claim in the complaint, the issue is
beyond the scope of this Tunney Act review proceeding. See
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1459. Even if
the CJS/AmJur2d issue were somehow relevant to the
complaint by virtue of the cross-referencing controversy
and therefore a proper topic for review, it appears to the
Court that the Department of Justice had an adequate
factual foundation to reasonably conclude that there was no
meaningful competition between the two publications and
that the merger therefore would not have an anticompetitive
effect with respect to those products.

In sum, based on extensive investigation and analysis, the
government concluded that the divestiture products will
remain viable and that their divestiture is sufficient to
cure the anticompetitive effects of the merger in the
relevant markets for such products. It is not the Court's
role to second-guess these factual and reasoned predictive
findings. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at
1461. The Court concludes that the Proposed Final Judgment
adequately ensures the viability of the divested Thomson
products, thereby curing the specific allegations in the
complaint that competition would be eliminated in those
particular product markets.9/


C. Giving a Divestiture Option To States With Official
Reporter Contracts

Several commentators expressed concerns about the scope and
terms of the provision of the Proposed Final Judgment that
requires Thomson to grant the Official Reporter contract
states the option to terminate their Thomson contracts for
publishing official reporters.


1. California

Edward Jessen, the Official Reporter of Decisions and
Secretary of the Advisory Committee for Publication of the
Official Reports of the State of California, initially
questioned whether the Proposed Final Judgment adequately
addressed the fact that California Reports and Deering's
California Codes share costs and text and should remain
together to stay competitive.

The revised Proposed Final Judgment in its most recent
incarnation requires that Deering's and its assets be
divested, and that California Reports and all its related
assets also. be divested if the governing entity in
California chooses to award the official publisher contract
to a different firm. This provision allows the California
governing body to concur in the need for divestiture of its
official reporter assets and to decide who should buy them
in light of the new ownership of Deering's.10/  Thus, the
Advisory Committee Mr. Jessen represents will now decide
whether to divest Thomson of California's official reporter
assets or to continue with Thomson. As a result, by letter
of September 17, 1996, Mr. Jessen indicated that he "now
fully support[s] the proposed consent decree for the
Thomson/West transaction as sufficient to protect
California's interests ...."


2. Washington

CD Law, Inc. of Seattle, Washington, publishes case law,
administrative law, and other Washington state legal
materials on CD-ROM and the Internet. CD Law commented that
"Thomson and West competed vigorously for the contract to
publish the official Washington state reports" and that
"there are virtually no publishers capable of competing
with West/Thomson." CD Law also pointed out that it
publishes only in electronic media and cannot compete in
the print market and argued that no other company could
viably compete with the post-merger Thomson/West
conglomerate.

The government, however, rejected CD Law's characterization
of the market, finding that Thomson and West are not the
only competitors in the State of Washington. The government
pointed to Darby, which currently holds the official
reporter contracts for Georgia and the Virginia Supreme
Court and recently was named the successful bidder in
Michigan, and to Michie, which publishes numerous print and
CD-ROM codes and case reporters, as examples of serious
potential bidders. The Court accepts the governments'
conclusion that the existence of these publishers will ens
are vigorous competition in Washington, particularly
because this conclusion has been adopted by the State of
Washington itself.

CD Law also expressed its concern that if Thomson/West were
to publish the official state reports it would not renew CD
Law's contract to write the headnotes for the official
state reports and that Thomson/West's control of the
official headnotes will adversely affect competition in the
CD-ROM market. The government responded that this concern
does not flow from the merger, as Thomson could have
decided not to renew its contract with CD Law and instead
to write its own headnotes at any time regardless of the
merger.

The Court finds this argument unpersuasive for two reasons
that flow directly from the new post-merger landscape.
First, West formerly competed with CD Law for the headnote
contract and therefore a post-merger Thomson/West clearly
would have an incentive to end its contract with CD Law.
Second, assuming for the moment the accuracy of CD Law's
description of the CD-ROM market, if Thomson/West were to
retain the official reporter contract, Thomson/West would
be able to deny CD Law access to official headnotes for use
in its CD-ROM products. While the government argues that CD
Law can produce its own headnotes, it is clear that access
to the official headnotes for a state reporter is a
valuable right that CD Law might well lose.  In the worst
case scenario, Thomson/West's control over the print market
could so adversely affect competition in the electronic
media markets as to drive CD Law out of business. Since the
government relies heavily on the presence of CD Law in the
Washington market to preserve competition, such a
development would be contrary to the stated goals of the
consent decree.11/

The United States and the State of Washington have
concluded that this is not a likely consequence of the
merger, however, and the Tunney Act does not contemplate de
novo judicial review of such fact-intensive calculations.
Rather, on such issues as this, the Court is to give a
substantial degree of deference to the government's
predictions concerning the impact of such mergers and
proposed remedies on competition. See United States v.
Microsoft Corp, 56 F.3d at 1460-61. Most important to this
Court's analysis is the fact that Washington State itself
supports the consent decree and is presumably in the best
position to assess the interests of its consumer citizens.
The Court therefore cannot find that the consent decree is
not in the public interest with respect to the State of
Washington.12/


3. Other States

John H. Lederer, Esq. a retired attorney in Oregon,
Wisconsin, expressed concern that defendants, who currently
publish the only two competing state reporters, will be the
only bidders for the Wisconsin official reporter contract.
The government concluded, however, that because a number of
companies bid for various official reporter contracts in a
number of states, any of these companies potentially could
bid for the Wisconsin official reporter contract once
Thomson divests itself of it. Proposed Final Judgment Para.
XI.A-C. Again, the divestiture remedy for official contract
states is designed to permit states such as Wisconsin to
decide whether or not to switch from Thomson to another
publisher, and the state of Wisconsin by and through its
Attorney General concurs in this arrangement. These factors
are sufficient for the Court to find this divestiture to be
in the public interest.

Darby Printing Company. a printer of court opinions in a
number of states, requested that Illinois, Massachusetts
and New York (where Thomson publishes other official
reporters) also be given the opportunity to reopen bidding
for official reporter contracts. The Court need not reach
this issue, however, because in these three states Thomson
is merely the printer and has no editorial control over the
reporters; the states themselves write the headnotes and
summaries and make either editorial judgments about
content. The only editorial competition in these states is
between the state and West, and this competitive
arrangement will be unaffected by the merger. These states
do not need a court order to choose a new printer that is
adequate to replace Thomson, and many printers could do the
job, including Darby. Finally, the Court notes that the
States of Illinois, Massachusetts and New York joined in
the complaint and have approved the settlement.

Ms. Kathleen Jo Gibson, commenting on behalf of the New
Mexico Compilation Commission, also requested that the
Proposed Final Judgment give New Mexico as well as other
states that have official reporters an option to reopen
bidding similar to the option now given to California,
Washington and Wisconsin. According to the New Mexico
Compilation Commission, "[f]or a number of reasons, it is
not economical for small states such as New Mexico to
contract with any other publisher . . ."

West has been the official reporter of New Mexico opinions
since 1933, and Thomson does not compete in New Mexico with
West as the official reporter. The merger therefore does
not affect competition for the sale of official reporters
in New Mexico, and this proceeding is not the proper forum
for obtaining the relief requested. New Mexico's dispute
with West over the copyrightability of West-reported New
Mexico opinions likewise is also not related to any actual
or potential competition likely to be lost as a result of
the Thomson/West merger and thus is not an appropriate
consideration for this Court.


D. Divestiture of Auto-Cite And Lexis-Nexis' Option To
Extend Critical Thomson Content Licenses

Lexis-Nexis and West Law offer virtually identical access
to actual court decisions as well as various, different,
competing enhancements and secondary legal materials and a
wide variety of competing non legal materials. The
complaint alleged in some detail that the merger would harm
competition in this comprehensive online legal research
services market. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the
merger would


lessen substantially competition in the market for
comprehensive online legal research services by increasing
Thomson's incentive to exercise market power by increasing
prices for, reducing quality and innovation of, or
withholding access to the following products now licensed
to Lexis-Nexis: United States Code Service, Deering's
California Code Annotated, Annotated Laws Of Massachusetts,
New York Consolidated Laws Service, and Michigan Statutes
Annotated; Auto-Cite; and the important nonlegal materials
[Investext, ASAP and Predicasts].


Complaint Para. 59.

Prior to the governments' review of the proposed merger,
Thomson and Lexis-Nexis negotiated extensions of the most
important licenses for Thomson content, both legal and
non-legal. These licenses included the following materials:
(1) legal services and publications (including Auto-Cite,
the American Law Reports ("ALR"), United States Code
Service, and AmJur2d); (2) non-legal databases (including
ASAP, Predicasts and Investext); and (3) tax materials from
the Research Institute of America. Virtually all of these
licenses were extended for five additional years and
generally at the prices that had been negotiated when
Thomson did not own WestLaw. With the extensions, the
average length of the licenses was approximately seven
years.

Plaintiffs concluded that two additional protections were
necessary beyond the voluntarily extended licenses. First,
for the non-legal databases ASAP, Predicasts and Investext,
identified by Lexis-Nexis; as particularly significant,
Thomson was required to extend Lexis-Nexis licenses for an
additional five years. Second, Thomson was required to
divest itself of Auto-Cite so that Lexis-Nexis could obtain
it from an independent source (or buy it itself).
Plaintiffs concluded that these two provisions of the
Proposed Final Judgment, together with the previously
negotiated license extensions, and the normal market
incentives and capabilities of Lexis-Nexis would maintain
sufficiently vigorous competition to protect consumers in
the comprehensive online legal research services market.

Lexis-Nexis has argued vigorously in its public comments,
its amicus brief, its post-hearing supplemental brief and
at the hearing that these actions are not enough. After
very careful consideration, the Court concludes that they
are in fact sufficient and that the public interest in
comprehensive online research services is served by the
consent decree.


1. TCSL And Product Differentiation

Lexis-Nexis argues that the divestiture of the products
contained in Thomson's Total Client Service Library
("TCSL") is essential to enable Lexis-Nexis to use the
components of the TCSL to compete with WestLaw's Key
Numbers and headnotes.13/  It asserts that there are four
portions of the TCSL that are essential "enhancements" that
Lexis-Nexis must license in order effectively to compete
with WestLaw: the annotations found in the American Law
Reports ("ALR") and Lawyers' Edition, the AmJur
encyclopedia. and AutoCite. See Declaration of Nicholas R.
Emrick ("Emrick Decl.") Para. 7 (Sept. 11, 1996).

The Court finds that the government was reasonable in
concluding that divesture of the entire TCSL is
unnecessary. Lawyers' Edition and Auto-Cite are both
divestiture products and Lexis-Nexis will have access to
them. The new owner of Lawyers' Edition, if other than
Lexis-Nexis, will have every incentive that Thomson had to
license to Lexis-Nexis.

The claim that the divestiture of AmJur is essential to
Lexis-Nexis is undercut by the fact that AmJur was only
added to the Lexis-Nexis service in February 1996 and by
Thomson's continuing interest in ensuring that its products
are cross-referenced as much as possible. As for ALR, the
government found no evidence that Thomson would stop
publishing ALR after the merger but rather that Thomson had
every incentive to maintain and improve ALR, to sell it
online, and to see to it that it is cross-referenced. The
revised Proposed Final Judgment expressly provides that


[d]efendants shall not claim or assert any right to
prohibit an Acquirer from including in any of the
Divestiture Products or any other publications
cross-references to the Defendant's products of the type
contained in Thompson's Total Client Service Library
("TCSL") or Integrated Legal Research System ("ILRS").
Defendants shall not claim or assert any right to prohibit
an Acquirer from including in Auto-Cite cross-references to
Thomson's American Law Reports or other annotations of the
type that are now included in Auto-Cite.


Proposed Final Judgment Para. IV.H. This provision ensures
that Thomson may not erect barriers to the
cross-referencing of ALR in the unlikely event that it
decided that it is in its interests to do so.

Furthermore, the government concluded that ALR is not a
substitute for West's Key Number system in finding cases
and researching legal issues, that there is no competition
between the two systems relevant to the complaint and that
Lexis-Nexis does not use ALR as such. Plaintiffs pointed to
evidence that "ALR was not viewed by consumers as a place
to start research" but rather that "[b]oth attorneys and
librarians view ALR as one of many available secondary
sources, often cited in the same category as law reviews
and treatises." ALR On-Line Market Research Report and
Recommendation, Prepared for Thomson Electronic Publishing
at 11 (Omnimark, Inc. 1991), Emrick Decl., Exhibit B.
Unlike West's Key Number system, "ALRs were not highly
regarded as definitive legal research." Id. at 12. Indeed,
Lexis-Nexis' own sales people reportedly felt that
"[a]ttorneys mostly use ALR as a last resort....." Id. at
10. Perhaps most importantly, "[n]o one understood the
analogy of ALR as a competitive alternative to Headnotes."
Id. at 9.

Nor is divestiture of the TCSL products necessary to allow
Lexis-Nexis to offer a differentiated product. Plaintiffs'
investigation revealed that aside from providing the same
actual court opinions, Lexis-Nexis and WestLaw enhancements
and services are quite different and that Lexis-Nexis
continues to add new, non-Thomson publications and
databases to its service. In addition, Lexis-Nexis was able
to negotiate and extend its license for ALR through the
year 2002 and its license for AmJur2d through 2006.
Furthermore, the Proposed Final Judgment requires Thomson
to grant Lexis-Nexis the option to extend its License
Agreements for three non-legal databases -- Investext, ASAP
and Predicasts -- which are offered on Nexis for an
additional five years; thus Lexis-Nexis may, at its option,
extend these contracts until 2010. Proposed Final Judgment
Para. X. This is sufficient time for Lexis-Nexis to seek
the resources to differentiate its product in other ways,
or to create competing databases.

In sum, the government found insufficient evidence that
either AmJur or ALR must be divested to preserve
competition with Corpus Juris Secundum, on the one hand, or
the West Key number system on the other. Under the Tunney
Act, the Department of Justice has the duty to review the
evidence and determine the litigative prospects and under
Microsoft, the Court will not second-guess these reasonable
conclusions.


2 Auto-Cite Divestiture

Auto-Cite is an electronic citation system owned by
Thomson. Auto-Cite runs case law through computer software
and editing to provide full case law citations, the history
of cases and other information, such as cross-references to
ALR and other products. In 1979, Thomson licensed Auto-Cite
to Mead Data Central; Lexis-Nexis subsequently succeeded to
the rights of Mead Data.14/ The original agreement was
amended in 1991 to provide that either party could assign
the Licensing Agreement and its rights and obligations
thereunder to "any successor to all or substantially all of
the business and assets of the assigning party ...."
Auto-Cite License Agreement Paras. 19.

Under the license, Lexis-Nexis is permitted to reproduce,
display and distribute materials in the Auto-Cite system.
Thomson is required to deliver to Lexis-Nexis once a month
-- or, upon request, more frequently -- all citation
information then included in the Auto-Cite system. Thomson
also must supply Lexis-Nexis with identifying changes made
in the citation information included in the Auto-Cite
system and copies of all case information included in the
system. Under the agreement, Lexis-Nexis has a right to use
the data provided pursuant to an agreed upon payment
schedule. The 1991 agreement was to be in effect until
December 31, 1997, with additional automatic renewals for
successive one-year terms. In March 1996 the parties agreed
to extend the term of the Auto-Cite license through
December 31, 2008. In anticipation of the West-Thomson
merger, the parties also agreed that if Thomson conveyed or
assigned Auto-Cite to anyone, it had to convey or assign
"all or substantially all of the business and assets
associated with the development, maintenance, and
enhancement of the Auto-Cite product." Auto-Cite Licensing
Agreement (as amended) Para. 19.

Plaintiffs concluded that Lexis-Nexis needed Auto-Cite in
order effectively to compete with Thomson/West in the
comprehensive online legal research service market.
Recognizing that Thomson's incentive to provide Auto-Cite
might be substantially diminished after the merger, the
Proposed Final Judgment as originally submitted to the
Court provided for the divestiture of Auto-Cite and
specifically established that the divestiture of Auto-Cite
must include:


the sale of all Auto-Cite trademarks and service markets,
the assignment of the Auto-Cite License Agreement, and
delivery of a transferrable royalty-free perpetual license
of the Auto-Cite case database as of the time of the
divestiture and all software, trade secrets, and know-how
used in producing and updating the Auto-Cite case database.


Proposed Final Judgment (before revision) Para. II.B.

Under this provision, Thomson must divest to an independent
acquirer of AutoCite all the means necessary to be able to
continue to offer Auto-Cite to Lexis-Nexis, other than new
cases which the acquirer can get from a number of sources
(including Lexis-Nexis and itS parent, Reed Elsevier),
without further help from, association with or payments to
Thomson. The acquirer will get all the hardware, software,
training, know-how, opportunity to employ editors, and
trade name now associated with the product. In addition,
the acquirer of Auto-Cite will obtain the historical
Auto-Cite database with which to begin supplying AutoCite
to its customers. The historical database will include
every cross-cite to every ALR annotation in the database as
of the day of the transfer, and the buyer will be able to
continue to cite to ALR. The buyer of Auto-Cite will, of
course, be able to update and improve AutoCite as it sees
fit.

Furthermore, to assure the continued quality of Auto-Cite,
the Proposed Final Judgment provides that the United
States, after consultation with the state plaintiffs, must
be satisfied that: (1) the acquirer of Auto-Cite can and
will operate Auto-Cite as a viable, ongoing product; (2)
the purchase is for the purpose of competing effectively in
the sale of Auto-Cite; and (3) the acquirer has the
managerial, operational and financial capability to compete
effectively in the sale of Auto-Cite. In addition, the
acquirer of Auto-Cite will be bound by the terms of the
existing license between Thomson and Lexis-Nexis. Proposed
Final Judgment Para. IV.B.

Lexis-Nexis nevertheless argues that the Proposed Final
Judgment does not effectuate a complete divestiture of
Auto-Cite and that defendants should have been required to
divest "all rights and interests" in Auto-Cite. It
complains that in reality Thomson is


not divesting itself of Auto-Cite at all: it is retaining
the database itself, the staff trained in its use; the
(apparently exclusive) right to use important elements of
the system, i.e., the cross-references and integration with
the ALRs and other Thomson products; and other important
incidents of ownership, such as the ability to sublicense.


Lexis-Nexis maintains that the Proposed Final Judgment
"impairs Lexis-Nexis' contract rights to Auto-Cite, thus
affirmatively damaging its ability to compete."

Lexis-Nexis' primary concern appears to be that because
Thomson is retaining a copy of the Auto-Cite database,
Thomson could use it to improve WestLaw, West's
comprehensive online legal research service whose
counterpart to Auto-Cite is called InstaCite.15/  While it
is true that the consent decree permits Thomson to use its
internal copy of the historical information contained on
the existing Auto-Cite database to maintain and improve
other Thomson/West products as well as for internal
editorial purposes, Thomson will have no right and no
access to the divested current Auto-Cite database and its
enhancements, improvements and updates. Auto-Cite will
become the sole property of another firm to develop, and
that firm will be able to exclude others from using
Auto-Cite and to license Auto-Cite to others as it wishes.
Under the consent decree, Auto-Cite would become a service
independent of Thomson and West in the hands of a buyer
with the ability to "compete effectively" in the supply of
the citator service to customers (including Lexis-Nexis).
Proposed Final Judgment Para. IV.B. Lexis-Nexis' fears
therefore are unfounded. Furthermore, plaintiffs concluded
that if Thomson does "upgrade" Insta-Cite, it would be a
procompetitive, not an anticompetitive, result.

Lexis-Nexis has also claimed that under the consent decree
the Auto-Cite database will not be sublicensable by its
acquirer. Plaintiffs and defendants have repeatedly denied
this assertion and stated that the acquirer will be able to
do whatever the acquirer wants with the Auto-Cite database
without fear of any interference from Thomson. In order to
remove any doubt as to the sublicensability of the
transferred Auto-Cite database, however, the parties now
have proposed to add to Paragraph II.B. of the Proposed
Final Judgment the word "sublicensable" to the description
of the license associated with the divested copy of the
historical Auto-Cite database. See supra at 10.

Lexis-Nexis also maintains that divesture of Auto-Cite
should include divestiture of ALR. The government found,
however, that Auto-Cite's primary value comes from its
accurate, up-to-the-date display of case citations and
whether or not a case is still good law, not from its
cross-references to ALR. In addition, as discussed above,
Thomson has an incentive to maintain and improve ALR, to
sell ALR online, and to see that it is cross-referenced as
often as possible. Therefore, Thomson's retention of ALR
should have no negative effect on the quality of
cross-cites to ALR on Auto-Cite or on Auto-Cite's
continuing viability.

Finally, Lexis-Nexis contends that the proposed consent
decree effectuates a taking of its property without
compensation under the Fifth Amendment because the terms of
the consent decree conflict with its current Auto-Cite
License Agreement with Thomson. The License Agreement
essentially requires that in order for Thomson to assign
the Agreement, Thomson must either establish a successor to
"all or substantially all of the business and assets
associated with the Auto-Cite product" or obtain the
consent of Lexis-Nexis.

Contrary to Lexis-Nexis' contention, the Court finds that
the consent decree does not require Thomson to breach the
Auto-Cite License Agreement. Thomson is required at a
minimum to divest Auto-Cite in accordance with the
provisions of the consent decree. If the License Agreement
requires more, the consent decree certainly permits Thomson
to fulfill those contractual obligations. If Lexis-Nexis
still believes that it has not received the full benefit of
its contract, it may pursue a contract remedy in an
appropriate court. Thus, whether Thomson complies with its
contract with Lexis-Nexis is a private contractual matter,
not a potential takings issue. If Lexis-Nexis' contract
with Thomson is breached, the breach will not be caused by
the consent decree or by any actions by the plaintiffs or
by this Court in entering the Final Judgment.

To give both Lexis-Nexis and the Court additional
confidence that entry of the decree will not affect the
parties' rights and interests under the Auto-Cite License
Agreement, after the Tunney Act hearing the parties revised
Paragraph II.B. of the Proposed Final Judgment to provide
that assignment of Auto-Cite will be made if and only if
permitted by the Auto-Cite License Agreement.16/  If not
permitted, Thomson must transfer the economic benefits it
receives under the Agreement (Lexis-Nexis' payment) to the
buyer of Auto-Cite. In other words, the Proposed Final
Judgment requires Thomson to assign the contract if it has
the unilateral right to do so and provides Thomson with an
alternative if it does not have such a right. If
Lexis-Nexis persuades another court that Thomson as a
contractual matter cannot assign Auto-Cite pursuant to the
License Agreement, Thomson may fulfill its obligations
under the contract and still comply with the consent
decree. Nothing in the consent decree relieves Thomson of
any of the obligations that it has undertaken in its
License Agreement with Lexis-Nexis. Because it appears that
Thomson is fully capable of meeting its obligations both
under the decree and its License Agreement the Court
concludes that the Proposed Final Judgment does not give
rise to a legitimate takings claim.


E. The Star Pagination License

West has long claimed a copyright in a page reference
system it has developed called "star pagination." Star
pagination is the insertion of symbols in the text of
judicial decisions to indicate where internal page breaks
occur in West's National Reporter System, and the placement
nearby of the corresponding West reporter page numbers.
Prior to the merger, West granted few, if any, licenses to
employ star pagination to anyone other than Lexis-Nexis and
has asserted copyright infringement claims against others.
Complaint Para. 32.

As a condition of the merger, the government has required
Thomson/West to grant a license to anyone who wants to star
paginate to West's National Reporter System publications
for a fee.17/

As reflected throughout its complaint, the government was
concerned that West's copyright claim and its refusal to
issue any licenses would impede entry into the markets
affected by the merger, particularly emerging electronic
forms of enhanced primary law and secondary law products.
See Complaint Paras. 32, 43, 52. In urging approval of the
Proposed Final Judgment, the government now argues,
however, that the mandatory licensing provision mitigates
many of the anticompetitive effects of the merger and,
indeed, increases the options available to competitors and
potential competitors to Thomson/West in comparison with
their pre-merger options. By contrast, Lexis-Nexis and many
of the commentators maintain that the government should
have required West to abandon its copyright claim
altogether as a condition of the merger since it was a
major anticompetitive factor in all three areas highlighted
in the complaint.

West's copyright claim in star pagination is controversial
and has been the subject of litigation. The United States
has consistently maintained that the use by others of star
pagination does not constitute copyright infringement, but
some courts have ruled to the contrary. See West Publishing
Co. v  Mead Data Central. Inc., 799 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir.
1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070 (1987); Oasis Publishing
Co. v. West Publishing Co., 924 F. Supp. 918 (Minn.
1996).18/ Judge John Martin of the United State District
Court for the Southern District of New York recently
rejected West's copyright claim. See Matthew Bender & Co.,
Inc. v. West Publishing Co., 94 Civ. 0589 (JSM) (S.D.N.Y.
Nov. 22, 1996).

Like Judge Martin, this Court has serious doubts about the
continuing vitality of the Eighth Circuit's 1986 opinion in
Mead Data in view of the subsequent decision of the Supreme
Court in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone
Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1990), and it finds unpersuasive
the reasoning in Oasis Publishing. In rejecting the "sweat
of the brow" doctrine of copyright, the Supreme Court
emphasized that the "sine qua non of copyright is
originalty"[sic] and that only those components of a compilation
that qualify as an "original work of authorship" can be
copyrighted. Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone
Service Co., 499 U.S. at 345, 357. The "selection,
coordination and arrangement" of a set of facts can be
copyrighted only if they are "sufficiently original to
merit protection." Id. at 358. Thus, in order to prevail on
its star pagination copyright claim, West would have to
demonstrate that its reporter page numbers and their
placement themselves represent an original, creative
decision about selection or arrangement, a "thin" copyright
claim at best. Id. at 349. As Judge Martin put it, "where
and on what pages the text of a court opinion appears does
not embody any original creation of the compiler ....
[S]tar pagination does not in any way take advantage of
that part of West's effort in making the compilation that
reflects its intellectual effort. It simply . . . reflects
the accident of where a particular portion of an opinion
ended up in a West reporter." Matthew Bender & Co., Inc. v.
West Publishing Co., 94 Civ. 0589 (JSM), Transcript at 35
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 1996).

Like many of the commentators, the Court is concerned that
including the star pagination license provision in the
Final Judgment might be construed as an endorsement by the
government or by the Court of West's dubious copyright
claim. While as plaintiffs point out, the Proposed Final
Judgment expressly states that the license provisions will
have no formal bearing, in any forum, on West's
intellectual property claim or on the government's right to
challenge it, the consent decree does legitimize
Thomson/West's ability to profit from the licenses for use
of star pagination while the copyright issue is litigated
in the Second and Eighth Circuits and, in all likelihood
before the Supreme Court.19/  That fact alone is
troublesome in view of the weakness of West's claim and the
limited market power of many of those who must pay the
license fee, particularly now that the most economically
powerful critic of West's position, Thomson, has lost its
incentive to contest the claim and joins West in advancing
it.20/

Thomson and West maintain that West's star pagination
copyright claim is not itself a Clayton Act violation, that
the government could not have obtained any concessions with
respect to it at a trial of this case, including relief in
the form of a mandatory license of the kind embodied in the
Proposed Final Judgment, and that the claim is unrelated to
the merger. From these propositions, they reason that the
Court's public interest inquiry should be limited to
whether the license agreement has a negative impact on the
public or on competitors in comparison to the status quo
ante and that the impact of the mandatory licensing
provision is a positive one. See Defendants' Response to
Public Comments at 26-27. This contention must fail.

First, defendants' assertion that star pagination could
never be deemed an antitrust violation or is unrelated to
the merger is belied by the government's repeated, indeed
pervasive references to the anticompetitive effects of star
pagination throughout the complaint. It was clearly a major
concern of the government's with respect to each of the
markets effected by the proposed merger. Second, the Court
is not limited to considering the immediate anticompetitive
effects of a proposed merger but may also anticipate future
anticompetitive practices and impacts in approving relief.
See United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150 n.80
Finally, the star pagination license is an essential part
of the consent decree before the Court -- negotiated by the
parties as a remedy for the anticompetitive impacts of the
merger -- and therefore necessarily is subject to review.
Whether this precise relief might or might not have been
obtained at trial is irrelevant. Just as the Court may not
second guess the government's choices about what claims to
bring in the first place, it should not treat differently
those concessions proposed in a consent decree that might
have been achieved at trial from those that might not have
been achievable. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56
F.3d at 1459. The Court has the authority and the
obligation to carefully scrutinize all the remedies
contained in the consent decree before it, including in
this case the star pagination license provision, no matter
how they got there.21/

One of the most disturbing aspects of the licensing
arrangement has been cured as a result of this proceeding.
At the September 30 hearing, the Court expressed skepticism
about the requirement originally contained in the proposed
license agreement that a licensee give up its right to
challenge West's copyright infringement claim. The Court
articulated its reluctance to place its judicial imprimatur
upon such a rights chilling provision. Near the conclusion
of the hearing, Thomson offered to eliminate the
prohibition and plaintiffs subsequently agreed to
incorporate this offer into the Final Judgment.22/ Thus, as
now before the Court, the consent decree contains no
prohibition on a licensee challenging West's star
pagination copyright even while it has a star pagination
license.

The consent decree still fails to address the assertions
expressed throughout the complaint that West's copyright
claim to star pagination itself is a barrier to entry in
the markets for primary enhanced law products and secondary
law products and the online legal research market. The
complaint alleges that "[b]ecause citations to the National
Reporter System are commonly required or expected by
courts, and thus sought by users, West's [star pagination]
copyright claim chills potential entry into the[] markets"
for primary enhanced law products and secondary law
products, particularly CD-ROMs, as well as, at least
indirectly, online research. Complaint Paras. 32, 43, 52.
With the consolidation of the formidable resources of West
and Thomson in all three of these areas, the government was
rightly concerned that star pagination and West's copyright
claim might significantly impede access to the text of
court decisions, discourage the publication of secondary
law products and hamper competition in the print, CD-ROM
and online research services markets. Even if West's
copyright claim were legally pristine, the government would
have been justified in its fear that the merger of these
two publishing giants in conjunction with West's asserted
star pagination copyright would chill entry into the legal
publishing markets identified in the complaint.  The
Supreme Court's decision in Feist, however, casts a long
shadow over defendants' legal claim, rendering the
maintenance of these barriers even more suspect.

Plaintiffs argue that the license agreement is a sufficient
remedy for the anticompetitive effects of star pagination
because it erects no further barriers to competition or to
the litigation of the copyright claim than previously
existed and provides a new option never before available.
Publishers can still star paginate without a license and
litigate the validity of the copyright claim, as they could
be fore the merger, or they may accept a new entry option
they would not otherwise have and have never had before,
the right to use star pagination without fear of legal
challenge by paying for a license at rates that plaintiffs
claim are low enough to reduce barriers to entry into the
markets identified in the complaint. The Court is not
persuaded by this argument. The very fact that the consent
decree authorizes Thomson/West to charge money for the use
of star pagination (albeit less money than West previously
charged Lexis-Nexis) while its dubious copyright claim is
being litigated raises public interest concerns. For small
publishers, the cost of such a license could well make the
difference between entry into the market and exclusion,
particularly in view of the provision in the license that
requires the payment of a separate license fee for each
format -- books, CD-ROM, online or the Internet -- which
several commentators have argued will erect even greater
barriers to potential entrants See, e.g., Public Comments
of James P. Love, Consumer Project on Technology; Public
Comments of Oasis Publishing Co., Inc.

The licensing remedy proposed by the parties has two
distinct aspects: the mandatory nature of the license,
namely, that Thomson/West must issue it to anyone who asks,
and the level of the fees.23/ The Court agrees with the
parties that the mandatory nature of the license cures the
concerns raised in the complaint that West has refused to
issue such licenses in the past, that the inability to use
star pagination is itself a significant barrier to entry
into the relevant markets, and that the denial of such
licenses threatens publishers with intensive and expensive
litigation if they employ star pagination without a
license. With the mandatory star pagination license, any
publisher can include star pagination in its publications
and refer to the West National Reporter system as is so
commonly required by courts and practitioners. See
Complaint Paras. 32, 43, 52. Furthermore, these publishers
are protected from litigation initiated by Thomson/West but
still can, if they choose, challenge the validity of the
copyright while using the license to preserve their ability
to compete. These features of the license preserve and may
even enhance the ability of competitors to challenge the
copyright claim. Accordingly, on balance. the Court finds
this aspect of the license to be in the public interest.24/

The same cannot be said for the proposed fee schedule or,
indeed, for any fee schedule. The asserted reasonableness
of the proposed fees does not resolve the overarching
problem that the establishment of a court-approved fee
schedule gives Thomson/West permission to profit from its
dubious copyright claim while maintaining by court order
significant barriers to entry into the relevant markets
identified in the complaint by smaller publishers,
particularly in the CD-ROM market. A pervasive theme of the
complaint is that star pagination impedes entry into the
relevant markets by potential competitors, Complaint Paras.
32, 43, 52, and the government has conceded that the
mandatory license only "reduces, does not eliminate, but
reduces [the] barrier . . . [to] entry into the secondary
law and enhanced primary law markets." Tunney Act Hearing
Tr. at 27. Whether the cost of entry is the result of
litigation over the star pagination copyright or the
payment of fees for the right to use star pagination, it
still constitutes a barrier to entry in the markets
identified in the complaint and, for most potential
competitors, an extremely costly one.

The star pagination license agreement and fee schedule do
not effectively remedy the anticompetitive effects of the
merger alleged in the complaint. Nor do they satisfactorily
answer the concern that the license agreement puts the
Court's imprimatur on West's copyright claim. The license
agreement places the cost of the star pagination copyright
dispute squarely on those with the better of the legal
argument after Feist and primarily on the shoulders of
small publishers who will have to continue to pay, either
via licensing fees or litigation, for access to star
pagination.25/ Since this lawsuit was filed precisely
because the Department of Justice concluded that the merger
of Thomson and West would harm competition in markets in
which it is already difficult for small publishers to
flourish, in the circumstances the Court must conclude that
the licensing fee provision is not a sufficient remedy for
the allegations of the complaint.

If the new Thomson/West entity wishes to preserve its
ability to maintain and pursue West's copyright claim, it
should bear the costs of doing so. It is not appropriate
for West to profit from the pursuit of its claim until it
is judicially resolved and for potential competitors to the
new merged company, primarily small publishers, to
effectively finance the litigation. The Court cannot
conclude that it is in the public interest for the costs of
litigation to be shifted to small publishers and for the
Court to sanction this cost-shifting based entirely on a
copyright claim that is dubious at best. See United States
v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 151; id. at 151 n.83. In view of
the many third parties that contend that they will be
injured by such a judicially-approved license, the Court
cannot "assum[e] that the decree is appropriate." United
States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1462. While West
certainly may maintain its legal claim and continue to
litigate it in the Second and Eighth Circuits and in the
Supreme Court, this Court will not require others to pay
for a license for the right to use star pagination and
suffer the anticompetitive consequences in the meantime.
The Court is forced to conclude that the licensing fee
provision and thus the Proposed Final Judgment are beyond
"the reaches of the public interest." United States v.
Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1460.[26/]

The Court suggests that the public interest would be served
if West and Thomson would agree to amend the license
provisions in the Proposed Final Judgment and in Exhibit B
to provide a free license to all who request one until
West's copyright claim is judicially resolved once and for
all. Under such a licensing agreement, Thomson/West may
continue to litigate the matter at its own expense, while
the barriers to market entry for competitors and potential
competitors will be reduced by permitting others to use
star pagination without having to pay either a fee or the
costs of litigation. The only difference between that
solution and the one proposed in the consent decree would
be that the Court and the Department of Justice would not
be extending their approval to the shifting of costs to
small publishers based on a legal claim of which the Court
is deeply suspicious and which the Department of Justice
vehemently opposes.

By contrast with the star pagination license issue, several
commentators complained that West's asserted copyright in
star pagination is inextricably linked to West's asserted
copyright in the text of judicial opinions themselves.  See
e.g., Geronimo Public Comment at 3-5. While it is obvious
to this Court that neither West nor anyone else has a
legitimate copyright claim to a judge's or a court's
opinions, it is equally apparent that to the extent that
West asserts a copyright in the public domain text of
judicial opinions, such a claim was not deemed relevant to
the merger and thus was not addressed by the government in
its complaint against West and Thompson. It therefore would
be inappropriate for the Court to consider this issue in
its Tunney Act public interest determination. United States
v. Microsoft Corp, 56 F.3d at 1460.[27/]

Other commentators believe that the star pagination license
should include a mandatory text license and a waiver of any
copyright claims on intermediate copying so long as any
published case does not include West headnotes and
summaries. These arguments rely mainly on the proposition
that the text of judicial opinions is difficult to obtain
and that Thomson will now benefit from West's control over
such text. While the availability of the text of judicial
opinions is necessarily of concern, it is not part of the
complaint in this action and therefore the concerns of
these commentators are also beyond the scope of this
proceeding.28/

A number of commenters further maintain that the star
pagination license should not require licensees to disclose
competitive product information to Thomson/West in order to
obtain a star pagination license. As the parties pointed
out, however, the license does not require the disclosure
of detailed information. Rather, Section 1.03 merely
requires licensees to provide to defendants a short,
general description of the licensee's product or service to
defendants in order to make it clear what product is
covered by the license. The license also must disclose what
cases are included in the product so that the license fee
can be calculated. This information, however, should not be
considered sensitive competitive information, as the cases
selected by the licensee for publication will subsequently
be public information.

Finally, some commentators believe that third party
information providers should be able to sell or license
case law data that include licensed star pagination and
text so long as the purchasers or licensees have entered
into or are subject to a pagination license agreement with
Thomson/West. Section 2.02 of the license provides that


nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Licensee from
selling, leasing, licensing or otherwise transferring
Licensee Case Reports that contain Licensed NRS Pagination
to third party information providers, but such transfers
shall not include or grant any right to reproduce, publish,
broadcast, distribute, loan, rent, lease, sell or otherwise
transfer, make available or use the Licensed NRS Pagination
contained in such Licensee Case Reports.


Nevertheless, to clarify that the license fee need only be
paid by the publisher, and not also by the third party
information provider, the parties have agreed to the
following language:


2.01. Star Pagination License. During the term of this
Agreement, . . . Licensor hereby grants to Licensees . . .
a nonexclusive, non-transferable ....limited license ...
(iv) to have a third party obtain, on behalf of Licensee,
NRS Pagination from West Case Reports contained in NRS
Reporter publications and include such NRS Pagination
(which shall become Licensed NRS Pagination when so
included) in corresponding Licensee Case Reports contained
in [Licensee Product(s)/Service(s)].


This additional language adequately addresses any potential
concerns about clarity that might exist. .


III. CONCLUSION

Before the Court can find the Proposed Final Judgment to be
in the public interest, the parties will have to modify it
to cure the defects caused by the star pagination licensing
fee schedule. The Court has suggested how this may be done
to its satisfaction. In deference to the fact that a
consent decree is the result of a negotiated settlement
between parties to a lawsuit, of course the parties may
propose any alternative remedy or combination of remedies
that adequately address the Court's concerns. An Order
consistent with this Opinion shall be entered this same
day.

SO ORDERED.

v.

THE THOMSON CORPORATION and

Defendants.

Civil Action No. 96-1415 (PLF)


ORDER

This case is before the Court pursuant to the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16 (the
"Tunney Act"), for a determination of whether the consent
decree presented in the form of a Proposed Final Judgment
proposed by the United States Department of Justice, the
state plaintiffs, The Thomson Corporation and West
Publishing Company is in the "public interest." Having
carefully considered the many briefs and other materials
submitted by the parties and amicus curiae, the 26 public
comments submitted to the Department of Justice, the
responses thereto, and the arguments presented in open
court, and for the reasons stated in the accompanying
Opinion issued this same day, the Court finds that the
Proposed Final Judgment as revised is in the public
interest but for the star pagination license provision
contained in Paragraph IX and in Exhibit B. Accordingly, it
is hereby

ORDERED that plaintiffs' Motion for Entry of the Proposed
Final Judgment is DENIED; and it is

FURTHER ORDERED that in view of the Court's Opinion the
parties may submit a revised Proposed Final Judgment with
an appropriate motion at their earliest convenience.

SO ORDERED.

United States District Judge

DATE: 12/23/96


ENDNOTES

1/ The Court found particularly helpful the public comments
of Lexis-Nexis and Hyper Law, Edward Jessen, the Reporter
of Decisions in California, the American Association of Law
Libraries, Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., Geronimo
Development Corporation, CD Law, Inc., Alois Gross, and
Kathleen Joe Gibson, the Secretary and Clerk to the New
Mexico Compilation Commission.

2/ Investext is a collection of approximately 200 brokerage
house reports regarding individual equities and industries.
ASAP is an indexed consolidation of approximately 450
specialized industry publications. Predicasts includes the
following three databases: (1) PROMT, an indexed database
of over 1,100 trade and business publications; (2) MARS, an
indexed database that includes information relating to
advertising and marketing of consumer products and
services; and (3) Newsletter, an indexed international
database including 650 different newsletters from 165
publishers. Complaint Para. 56

3/ In addition to Auto-Cite, Investext, ASAP and
Predicasts, other products mentioned in the complaint that
are now licensed by Thomson to Lexis-Nexis are the United
States Code Service ("U.S.C.S."), Deering's California Code
Annotated, the Annotated Laws of Massachusetts, New York
Consolidated Laws Services, Michigan Statutes Annotated and
WestTex.

4/ The State of Connecticut did not join in the Response to
Comments but, as explained at the Tunney Act hearing, its
failure to do so was for logistical reasons and not because
it disagreed with the Response or otherwise disassociated
itself from the position of the other state plaintiffs. The
State of Connecticut joined in the Motion of Plaintiffs for
Entry of the Revised Final Judgment, filed on October 23,
1996.

5/ On November 12, 1996, this Court denied Tax Analysts'
motion for reconsideration of its denial of amicus curiae
status and its motion for appointment of a special master
or for the taking of expert testimony. While, as Tax
Analysts points out, Section 16(f)(1) of the Tunney Act
provides for the taking of testimony of expert witnesses
"upon the motion of any party or participant or upon its
own motion, as the court may deem appropriate," 15 U.S.C.
Sec. 16(f)(1), the statute clearly provides discretion to
the court to decide if such testimony is "appropriate."

In this case, the Court concludes that no expert testimony
is required.

6/ On November 12, 1996, the Court denied the motion of
Geronimo Development Corporation to participate as amicus
curiae.

7/ Amicus curiae Hyper Law, Inc., requested the Court to
require disclosure of more documents by the government,
including previously undisclosed investigative documents,
and further publication in the Federal Register before the
decree is approved, as well as certain modifications to the
decree. There is, however, nothing in the statute or in the
case law that requires additional disclosure of documents
or further publication and opportunity for comment.
Furthermore, since the enactment of the Tunney Act no Court
has required the United States to disclose its
investigatory files as a condition for approving a decree.
Cf. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1459.

8/ The parties propose to require Thompson/West to divest
itself of the following 52 publications: United States Code
Service, U.S. Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition, U.S.
Digest, Manual of Federal Practice, Bankruptcy Law &
Practice, Bankruptcy (Epstein, Nickels & White), Corbin on
Contracts, Insurance Law (Appleman), Search & Seizure
(Thomson), Ballantine's Law Dictionary, Auto-Cite,
Deering's Annotated California Code, California ADR
Practice Guide, California Civil Practice Handbook,
California Civil Trialbook, California Litigation By the
Numbers Court Rules Companion, California Negligence and
Settlement, California Products Liability Law & Practice,
California Trial, California Tort Law, Modern California
Discovery, Colorado Trial Handbook, Trial Handbook for
Connecticut Lawyers, Florida Criminal Law Practice &
Procedure, Florida Evidence 2d, Illinois Jurisprudence,
Indiana Appellate Handbook 2d, Kentucky Probate PSL,
Kentucky Workers' Compensation PSL, Louisiana Code of
Evidence Annotated, Louisiana Successions, Louisiana
Workers' Compensation, Annotated Laws of Massachusetts,

Relations PSL, Massachusetts Landlord-Tenant Law,
Massachusetts Real Estate PSL, Michigan Criminal Law,
Michigan Statutes Annotated, Michigan Digest, New Jersey
Criminal Procedure, New York Consolidated Laws Service, New
York Wills & Trusts, Ohio Family Law, Ohio Probate, Modern
Texas Discovery, Texas Civil Pre-Trial Procedure, Texas
Trial & Appellate Practice, Washington Trial Handbook,
Michigan Law & Practice, New York Estate Administration,
Pennsylvania Law Encyclopedia. See Exhibits A. 1 & A.2 to
the Proposed Final Judgment.

9/ One commentator, Alois Gross, interprets some of the
language in the Proposed Final Judgment to require bidders
for divestiture products to bid on the entire list of
divestiture products and to forbid bidding on single
products. He also states that he was given this information
by a Thomson representative and that his firm was not given
information about the individual products on which it
wished to bid. The Court understands the Proposed Final
Judgment to provide that a potential acquirer may bid on
any or all divestiture products. Any potential bidder
therefore is entitled to information about any single
divestiture product or set of products. See Proposed Final
Judgment, Paras. IV.E, IV.F Neither plaintiffs nor
defendants have proffered any other interpretation of the
proposed Final Judgment.

10/ The Proposed Final Judgment treats the states of
Washington and Wisconsin exactly the same way.

11/ If Washington were to choose to award the official
reports contract to another publisher, this concern over
the headnotes would disappear since the Proposed Final
Judgment requires Thomson to transfer any intellectual
property rights in the headnotes to the state. Proposed
Final Judgment Para. XI.C.

12/ CD Law also commented that "the Washington State legal
publishing market is pervaded with anti-competitive
practices that include predatory pricing, exclusive
contracts for certain legal materials, and tying
agreements. The Department consent decree does little or
nothing to prevent or ameliorate these practices." These
comments go beyond the allegations and issues in the
complaint and therefore are not relevant to the Tunney Act
proceeding. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d
at 1459-60.

13/ Thomson's Total Client Service Library ("TCSL") is a
cross-referencing system that provides citations to other
products and publications that contain relevant case law
and analyses. For example, at the beginning of each Supreme
Court case reported in Lawyers' Edition, there is a list of
TCSL cross-references that are relevant to that Supreme
Court case.

14/ The original agreement was between Mead Data and the
Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company, but Thomson
succeeded to all the rights and obligations of Lawyers
Cooperative which is now a division of Thomson.

15/  Insta-Cite offers only a portion of what Auto-Cite
offers; it does not, for example, offer negative, indirect
case history before 1972, nor does it offer
cross-references to ALR.

16/ Paragraph II.B now provides in pertinent part:

Auto-Cite is a Divestiture Product and its divestiture
shall include the sale of all Auto-Cite trademarks and
service marks, the assignment of the Auto-Cite License
Agreement if permitted by contract or otherwise the
transfer of the economic benefits equivalent to those
received by Thomson under the Auto-Cite License Agreement,
and delivery of a transferrable sublicensable royalty-free
perpetual license of the Auto-Cite case database as of the
time of the divestiture and all software, trade secrets,
and know how used in producing and updating the Auto-Cite
case database.

17/  The Proposed Final Judgment contains the terms of the
mandatory license, designated as Appendix B.

18/  The United States recently filed briefs arguing
against West's copyright claim in Matthew Bender & Co.,
Inc. v. West Publishing Co., 94 Civ. 0589 (JSM) (S.D.N.Y.)
and Oasis Publishing Co. v. West Publishing Co., No.
96-2887 (8th Cir.).

19/  The following language was added to the Proposed Final
Judgment to emphasize the government's view that entry of
the consent decree should have no bearing on the parties'
respective positions with respect to West's copyright
claim:

[D]efendants acknowledge that plaintiffs' consent to the
entry of this decree should not be read to suggest that
plaintiffs believe that a license is required before a
legal publisher may star paginate to defendants products
and that plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to assert
their views concerning the extent, validity, or
significance of any intellectual property right claimed by
defendants, in judicial proceedings or in any other forum.
Plaintiffs and defendants further agree that this Final
Judgment shall have no impact whatsoever on any
adjudication concerning these matters. Defendants have
agreed that they will not use the model license contained
in this Final Judgment, or the fact that any such license
was included in the Final Judgment, in any litigation or
negotiations with third parties to support the validity of
their position on star pagination.

Proposed Final Judgment at 2-3.

20/  The Final Judgment as originally proposed to the Court
exacerbated the problem by requiring that those who enter
into star pagination licenses with Thomson/West refrain
from challenging the copyright, at least during the
pendency of the license. This provision was eliminated
after the Tunney Act hearing.

21/ On a related issue, Geronimo Development Corporation
argued that the star pagination licensing remedy is beyond
the scope of the complaint because it encompasses the
licensing of page numbers from the Federal Reporter and
Federal Supplement series case reports, published by West.
The complaint does not address the market for lower federal
court enhanced case law because the government found
insufficient evidence to allege that Thomson is an actual
potential or perceived potential competitor to West's
alleged monopoly in enhanced lower federal court case law.

Even if Geronimo were correct in its assertion that lower
federal court enhanced case law is irrelevant to the star
pagination issue, an assertion not at all obvious to the
Court, the government was well within its authority to
include such case law in the license. As plaintiffs
explain, inclusion of the entire West Reporting System in
the star pagination license was necessary and appropriate
to allow potentially entering firms the maximum flexibility
in shaping their new or improved products, particularly in
the secondary law product markets. While the Court is not
authorized to inject new issues into the case, there is
nothing in the Microsoft opinion to suggest that there is
any limitation on the issues that the government may raise
in its negotiations.

22/  To effect the revision, Paragraph 3.01 to Exhibit B of
the Final Judgment, the star pagination license, has been
amended to delete the clause, "(i) shall respect and not
contest the validity of the copyrights claimed by Licensor
in Licensor's arrangements of case reports in NRS Reporters
as expressed by NRS Pagination; and (ii)."

23/ In seeking approval of the star pagination license
provision, the parties argue that the fees are reasonable,
that they were even further reduced in the course of
negotiations, and that they are far less than the fees
charged to Lexis-Nexis. The fees per thousand characters
contained in the Proposed Final Judgment as now proposed to
the Court are as follows:

1st year of a license.....4 cents

2nd year of a license.....4 cents

3rd year of a license.....6 cents

4th year of a license.....6 cents

5th year of a license.....8 cents

6th year of a license.....8 cents

7th year of a license.....9 cents

Subsequent years..........9 cents

Proposed Final Judgment Para. IX.A.

24/ The Court also finds no problem with the clarity or
enforceability of the proposed remedy. United States v.
Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1461. One commentator claimed
that the proposed star pagination license is ambiguous as
to the license fee to be charged for books. Plaintiffs
state clearly, however, that the fee would be paid by the
licensee in the year the book is printed so that books
first printed, then stored, and sold in later years would
not require additional fee payments for the later years. In
order to avoid any confusion, the parties have agreed to
modify the License Agreement so that it reads: "the license
fee for [print Licensee Product(s)] need only be paid for
the year in which the [print Licensee Product(s)] are
printed." Proposed Final Judgment, Ex. B, Section 2.03.

25/ Presumably, Lexis-Nexis is competitively able to absorb
these fees since they will be less than the fee schedule
previously negotiated between Lexis and West.

26/ The public commentators almost universally would have
the Court eliminate the star pagination license agreement
altogether and force West to abandon its copyright claim as
a quid pro quo for approval of the merger.  While it is
certainly open to West/Thomson to abandon the copyright
claim, it would be inappropriate for the Court to make an
implicit determination on the merits of West's claim. While
there may be circumstances under which courts are justified
in requiring companies to relinquish legal claims or forego
other benefits or entitlements under the Tunney Act public
interest review provisions, see United States v. AT&T, 552
F. Supp. at 217, this Court will not go so far.

27/ Matthew Bender comments that it believes that West
further claims "a copyright interest in the initial
parallel citations (i.e., the cite to the first page of a
case) in the National Reporter System that may be infringed
when a competitor uses such citations." The governments'
investigation revealed that West does claim such a
copyright interest but concedes that third party use of
such citations is a fair use and that such citations
therefore are "effectively in the public domain." See
Defs.' Response to Public Comments at 26 n.27 (use of first
page citations is "fair use"). Furthermore, West has never
sought to enforce such a copyright interest, and defendants
have stated that they have no intention of attempting to do
so in the future.

28/ Others commented that Thomson/West should be required
to agree not to assert future database protection
legislation and anti-RAM copying claims against licensees,
for use of star pagination. This issue is specifically
addressed in the proposed license in Exhibit B. The
proposed license ensures that Thomson/West will not contend
that a licensee's use of star pagination infringes any
intellectual property right. Section 2.01 also provides
that "Licensor [Thomson] shall not challenge, under any
present or future legislation, any use by the Licensee of
Licensed NRS Pagination if Licensee's use of same conforms
to the terms of this Agreement." (emphasis added).

[Editor's Note: A Circuit Court judge in Hawaii ruled that the

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
STATE OF HAWAII

CIVIL NO. 91-1394

FINDINGS OF FACT AND
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW


NINIA BAEHR, GENORA DANCEL,
TAMMY RODRIGUES, ANTOINETTE
PREGIL, PAT LAGON, AND
JOSEPH MELILLO,

Plaintiffs,

vs .

LAWRENCE H. MIIKE, in his
official capacity as Director
of the Department of Health,
State of Hawaii,

Defendant.


FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

This case came on for trial before the Honorable Kevin S.C.
Chang on September 10, 1996. Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora
Dancel, Tammy Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon, and
Joseph Melillo were represented by attorneys Daniel R.
Foley, Evan Wolfson and Kirk H. Cashmere. Defendant
Lawrence H. Miike was represented by Deputy Attorney
Generals Rick J. Eichor and Lawrence Goya. The Court having
reviewed all the evidence admitted at the trial and having
considered the arguments and other written submissions of
counsel for the parties and the briefs filed by the amicus
curiae, hereby makes the following Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law.


FINDINGS OF FACTS

I. THE PARTIES

1. At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr,
Genora Dancel, Tammy Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat
Lagon and Joseph Melillo (hereinafter collectively referred
to as "Plaintiffs") were or are residents of the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii.

2. Defendant Lawrence H. Miike ("Defendant") is a resident
of the City and County of Honolulu. State of Hawaii.
Defendant Miike is sued in his official capacity as
Director of Department of Health, State of Hawaii. [When
this lawsuit was commenced, John Lewin was the Director of
Department of Health, State of Hawaii. Thereafter, pursuant
to Rule 43(c) of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure,
Defendant Miike was automatically substituted for Defendant
Lewin when he assumed the position of the Director of
Department of Health, State of Hawaii. A Notice of
Substitution of Parties was also filed by defense counsel
on April 23, 1996.]


II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint for Injunctive and
Declaratory Relief ("Complaint") on May 1, 1991.

4. In pertinent part, Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that on
or about December 17, 1990, Defendant and his agent denied
the applications for marriage licenses presented by
Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs Rodrigues and
Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo, respectively,
solely on the ground that the couples are of the same sex.
Plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration that the
construction and application of Hawaii Revised Statutes
("HRS") 572-1 to deny an application for a license to marry
because an applicant couple is of the same sex is
unconstitutional.

5. Defendant filed an Amended Answer to Complaint on June
7, 1991. In pertinent part, Defendant admitted that
Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs Rodrigues and
Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo applied for
marriage licenses on December 17, 1990, and that the
couples applications for marriage licenses were denied by
Defendant through his agent on the ground that the couples
are of the same sex.

6. On July 9, 1991, Defendant filed a Motion For Judgement
on the Pleading which sought a dismissal of the lawsuit.
Defendant asserted, in pertinent part, that Plaintiffs in
their Complaint had failed to state a claim against
Defendant upon which relief could be granted.

7. A hearing was held on Defendant's Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings on September 3, 1991.

8. An Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the
Pleading was filed on October 1, 1991. A Judgment in favor
of Defendant and against Plaintiffs was also filed on
October 1, 1991. 9. Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal
to the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii on October 17,
1991.

10. In Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993), the
Hawaii Supreme Court vacated the circuit courts order and
judgment in favor of Defendant and remanded the case to the
circuit court for further proceedings. In pertinent part,
the Hawaii Supreme Court directed the following.


On remand, in accordance with the "strict scrutiny"
standard, the burden will rest on [Defendant] to overcome
the presumption that HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by
demonstrating that it furthers compelling state interests
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of
constitutional rights.


Id., 74 Haw. at 583 (citations omitted).

11. On May 17, 1993, Defendant filed a motion for
reconsideration or clarification to the Hawaii Supreme
Court.

12. On May 27, 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court granted
Defendant's motion for reconsideration, or, in the
alternative, for clarification in part, and clarified the
mandate on remand as follows.


Because, for the reasons stated in the plurality opinion
filed in the above-captioned matter on May 5, 1993, the
circuit court erroneously granted Lewin's motion for
judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the plaintiffs'
complaint, the circuit court's order and judgment are
vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with the pluralitv opinion. On remand, in
accordance with the "strict scrutiny" standard, the burden
will rest on [Defendant] to overcome the presumption that
HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by demonstrating that it
furthers compelling state interests and is narrowly drawn
to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.


Baehr v. Lewin 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993),
reconsideration and clarification granted in part, 74 Haw.
645, 852 P.2d 74 (1993) (citations omitted).

13. An Order of Early Assignment to Trial Judge was filed
on May 5, 1995.

14. On July 13, 1995, Defendant Director of Health's Motion
for Reservation of Questions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii
and for Stay Pending Appeal, or, in the alternative for
Stay Pendinq the Action of The Commission on Sexual
Orientation and the Law and of The Eighteenth Legislature
filed on July 5, 1995, was granted in part, and the trial
in the above-captioned case was rescheduled from September
25, 1995 to July 15, 1996. See Order Denying Defendant
Director of Health's Motion for Reservation of Questions to
the Supreme Court of Hawaii and for Stay Pending Appeal,
and Granting Alternative Motion for Stay of Trial Pending
the Action of The Commission on Sexual Orientation and the
Law and of The Eighteenth Legislature filed on September 7,
1995.

15. A Notice of Change of Responsible Deputy was filed on
April 18, 1996, which stated that responsibility for
handling of the case on behalf of the Defendant had been
changed to Deputy Attorney General Rick J. Eichor.

16. Following a status conference with counsel on April 19,
1996, a Stipulation to Continue Trial Date and Order was
filed on May 9, 1996. As a result, the trial in the
above-captioned case was continued from the week of August
1, 1996 to September 10, 1996.


III. DEFENDANT'S POSITION

17. The directive of the Hawaii Supreme Court is clear.
Pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court, Defendant has
the burden of proof in this case. Id.

18. Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement was filed
on May 13, 1996. In pertinent part, Defendant stated the
following.


[A]ll that remains is for the State to show that there is
a compelling State interest to deny Plaintiff marriage
licenses because they are of the same sex and that this
compelling interest is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary
abridgments of constitutional rights.

The following substantial and compelling state interests
will he shown:

a. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting
the health and welfare of children and other persons. . . .

b. That the State has a compelling interest in fostering
procreation within a marital setting. . . .

c. That the State has a compelling interest in securing or
assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in other
jurisdictions. . . .

d. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting
the State's public fisc from the reasonably foreseeable
effects of State approval of same-sex marriage in the laws
of Hawaii. . . .

e. That the State has a compelling state interest in
protecting civil liberties, including the reasonably
foreseeable effects of State approval of same-sex
marriages, on its citizens.


Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement at pages 2-4.

19. Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum was filed on September
6, 1996. In pertinent part, Defendant asserted the
following.


The State of Hawaii has a compelling interest to promote
the optimal development of children. . . . It is the State
of Hawaii's position that, all things being equal, it is
best for a child that it be raised in a single home by its
parents, or at least by a married male and female. . . .

The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest of
securing or assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in
other jurisdictions. . . .

The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest in
protecting the public fisc from the reasonably foreseeable
effects of approval of same-sex marriage.


Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum at pages 1, 2 and 4.

20. Defense counsel acknowledged Defendant's burden of
proof and, in pertinent part, stated the following in his
Opening Statement. "The State has a compelling interest in
promoting the optimal development of children. . . . It is
the State's policy to pursue the optimal development of
children, to unite children with their mothers and fathers,
and to have mothers and fathers take responsibility for
their children." Trial Transcript ("Tr.") 9/10/96. pages
4-5.


IV. DEFENDANT'S WITNESSES

21. Defendant presented testimony from the following expert
witnesses: (1) Kyle D. Pruett, M.D.; (2) David Eggebeen,
Ph.D.; (3) Richard Williams, Ph.D.: and (4) Thomas S.
Merrill, Ph D.

22. Dr. Kyle Pruett is an expert in the field of
psychiatry, specializing in child development. Beginning in
1981 and continuing for a ten-year period, Dr. Pruett
conducted a longitudinal study of fifteen families with
young children with regard to the developmental competence
of children raised primarily by their fathers in intact
families. At the end of his study, Dr. Pruett found that
children raised by families with primarily paternal care in
the early months and years of life are competent and robust
in their development, and are not sources of clinical
concern.

23. In pertinent part, Dr. Pruett found that there were
unique paternal contributions made by a father which had a
positive effect on the following: (1) a child's self-esteem
and feelings of being loved and important to the family;
(2) a child's ability to cope with frustration and
discouragement; (3) a child's interest in generative or
creative matters; and (4) a child's gender flexibility.

24. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that the unique or
non-replicable contributions offered by a father (and the
unique contributions offered by a mother) are "small", in
comparison to the contributions that parents make together
to their children. Tr. 9/10/96, page 84. Dr. Pruett
conceded that the beneficial results described above are
not essential to being a happy, healthy and well-adjusted
child. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 86-87.

25. Dr. Pruett testified that biological parents have a
predisposition which helps them in parenting children. The
predisposition is based upon the following factors: (1)
chromosomal or genetic contributions; (2) the parents'
choice and timing of conception or procreation; (3) the
physical changes to the mother's body and the father's
observations and interaction with those changes; (4)
immediate bonding upon the child's birth; and (5) a
predisposition to sacrifice and make one's self secondary
to the needs of the child.

26. Dr. Pruett also expressed his belief that children
which are adopted or are the result of assisted
reproduction live in a "burden[ed] system." Tr. 9/10/96,
pages 58, 62.

27. Dr. Pruett stated that same-sex relationships do not
provide the same type of learning model or experience for
children as does male-female parenting, because there is an
overabundance of information about one gender and little
information about the other gender. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

28. Nevertheless, Dr. Pruett also stated that same-sex
parents can, and do, produce children-with a clear sense of
gender identity. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 106.

29. Dr. Pruett stated the following with respect to raising
children in a same-sex marriage environment.


Q. And in comparing same sex parenting with opposite sex
parenting, which is more likely to pose greater
developmental difficulties for children?

A. In terms of probability, same-sex marriages are more
likely to provide a more burdened nurturing domain.


Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

30. It is Dr. Pruett's opinion that most children are more
likely to reach their optimal development being raised in
an intact family by their mother and father. According to
Dr. Pruett, this family configuration presents the fewest
burdens on child development. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.

31. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that single parents,
gay fathers, lesbian mothers and same-sex couples have the
potential to, and often do, raise children that are happy,
healthy and well-adjusted. Tr.  9/10/96, page 69.

32. Dr. Pruett testified that single parents, gay fathers,
lesbian mothers, adoptive parents, foster parents and
same-sex couples can be, and do become, good parents. Tr.
9/10/96, page 71. Significantly, Dr. Pruett knows the
foregoing to be true based on his clinical experience. Tr.
9/10/96, page 72.

33. More specifically, Dr. Pruett stated that parents'
sexual orientation does not disqualify them from being
good, fit, loving or successful parents. Tr. 9/10/96, page
72.

34. Dr. Pruett agreed that, in general, gay and lesbian
parents are as fit and loving parents as non-gay persons
and couples. Tr. 9/10/96, page 73.

35. Same-sex couples have the same capability as
different-sex couples to manifest the qualities conducive
to good parenting. Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.


Dr. Pruett testified as follows.

Q. And you've seen same-sex couples that have those
qualities [to being good parents]?

A. Yes.

Q. And have made good parents?

A. And have made good parents, yes.

Q. And good parents as a couple?

A. Yes.


Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.

36. Dr. Pruett also agreed that same-sex couples should be
allowed to adopt children, provide foster care and to take
children in and raise and care for them. Tr. 9/10/96, page
73.

37. Importantly, Dr. Pruett testified that the quality of
the nurturing relationship between parent and child could,
and would, outweigh any limitation or burden imposed on the
child as a result of having same-sex parents. Tr. 9/10/96,
page 79.

38. Finally, when questioned regarding research performed
by Charlotte Patterson regarding children raised by
same-sex couples, Dr. Pruett expressed his agreement with
the general conclusions reached by Dr. Patterson. Tr.
9/10/96, pages 132-133.

More specifically, Dr. Pruett agreed with the following
conclusions, that gay and lesbian parents "are doing a good
job" and that "the kids are turning out just fine." Tr.
9/10/96, pages 133-134.

Dr. Pruett was not surprised by Dr. Patterson's
conclusions. In fact, they are what he expected to see, and
although Dr. Pruett questions Dr. Patterson's research
methodology, he is not aware of any data, research or
literature which disputes Dr. Patterson's findings and
conclusions. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 132-134.

39. Dr. David Eggebeen is an expert in the field of
sociology with a special emphasis in demographics related
to family and children.

40. In pertinent part, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding
changes or trends which have occurred in partnering, child
bearing and labor force behavior in the United States. For
example, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding the following
facts: (1) the marriage rate in the U.S. population has
declined over the past twenty years; (2) the median age of
marriage for women in the U.S. population has risen over
the past twenty years; (3) the annual divorce rate in the
U.S. population has increased over the past approximate
thirty years; (4) the number of young adults currently
cohabiting has increased over the past eight years; (5) the
birth rate for women in the U.S. population has decreased
over the past twenty years; (6) the number of proportionate
births to non-married women in certain racial groups has
increased over the past thirty years; and (7) the number of
women in the labor force in the U.S. population and the
number of working mothers with children under the age of
six has increased dramatically over the past thirty years.

41. Based on his studies of the changes referred above, Dr.
Eggebeen testified as follows.


[C]hildren are going through fundamental changes in the
structure of childhood and what we're seeing today is
children today are living in very different circumstances
than was evident or the case in the past. It's common today
to find children in single parent families. It's common
today to find children in single parent families. It's
common today to find children living with a mother who
never married. It's common today to find children in
remarried families. It's common today to find children in
dual earner families where both parents participate in the
type of work. It is common or getting common to find
children whose parents never married and they're
cohabiting.


Tr. 9/11/96, pages 32-33.

42. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that, as of 1990,
almost six out of ten children in the United States are
living in families where their parents are married and both
of the parents are biological parents of the child.

43. Dr. Eggebeen explained further that ". . . children
have gone through substantial changes in their lives. . .
[T]here is greater diversity in living arrangements and
family --- in families that children live today in the
'9Os. However, a substantial percentage of children remain
or will spend their childhood in . . . traditional kinds of
family structures." Tr. 9/11/96, page 38.

44. Based on his research, Dr. Eggebeen concluded that
marriage is a "gateway to becoming a parent," and marriage
is synonymous with having children. Tr. 9/11/96, page 42.

45. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that individuals
get married without intending to have children, or marry
and are biologically unable to have children. Further, the
absence of the intent or the ability to have children does
not weaken the institution of marriage.

In fact, Dr. Eggebeen recognized that people marry and want
to get married for reasons other than having children; that
those reasons are valuable and important; and that
regardless of children, it is beneficial to society for
adults to marry. Dr. Eggebeen testified that individuals
should not be prohibited from marriage simply because they
cannot have children. Tr. 9/11/96, pages 55-57.

46. Dr. Eggebeen testified that children raised in a single
parent home are at a "heightened risk", as compared to
children raised in a married couple family. Tr. 9/11/96,
page 43. According to Dr. Eggebeen, children in a single
parent family are at greater risk  for the following: (1)
poverty or economic hardship; (2) poor academic
performance; (3) behavior problems and conduct disorders;
and (4) premarital or teenage birth for girls.

47. Dr. Eggebeen stated that remarriage or cohabiting with
a step-parent does not lessen or eliminate the risks to
children from single parent families. "[C]hildren in a
remarriage family. . . do not seem to perform any
differently than children who remain in single parent
families and therefore their performance or the risk of
poor outcomes is about the same as is for children in
single parent families." Tr. 9/11/96, page 46.

48. Dr. Eggebeen suggested that the lack of improvement in
risk factors in remarriage or step-parent families may be
attributable to "the role ambiguity of step parent
relationships," characteristics which a step-parent brings
to the family and which adversely affect the children or
the absence of a biological relationship with the children.
Tr. 9/11/96, pages 46-48. With respect to the latter, Dr.
Eggebeen related the story of Cinderella and her evil
stepmother. Tr. 9/11/96, page 48.

49. Dr. Eggebeen equates a same-sex couple with children to
a step-parent situation with all of the above-described
risk factors. Specifically, Dr. Eggebeen testified that
"same-sex marriages where children [are] involved is by
definition a step parent relationship," because there is
one parent who is not the biological parent of the child.
Tr. 9/11/96, pages 49.

50. However, Dr. Eggebeen conceded that there are some
situations involving a same-sex couple which would not fit
the classic step-parent scenario. For example, a situation
involving a same-sex couple that sought and received
reproductive assistance and in which the non-biological
parent was fully involved from the beginning of the
planning process, was present throughout the nine month
period and at birth, and thereafter, raised the child as
though they were the biological parents of the child. Tr.
9/11/96, pages 114-115.

51. Dr. Eggebeen also testified that single parents,
adoptive parents, lesbian mothers, gay fathers and same-sex
couples can create stable family environments and raise
healthy and well-adjusted children. Tr. 9/11/96, page 82.

52. It is Dr. Eggebeen's opinion that gay and lesbian
couples can, and do, make excellent parents and that they
are capable of raising a healthy child. Tr. 9/11/96, page
83.

53. Dr. Eggebeen agrees that gay and lesbian parents should
be allowed to adopt children and serve as foster parents.
Tr. 9/11/96, page 85.

54. Dr. Eggebeen testified that cohabiting same-sex couples
are less stable than married couples. However, the sole
basis for Dr. Eggebeen's conclusion is a chart taken from
the book entitled American Couples, co-authored by Pepper
Schwartz, Ph.D. The chart which summarizes approximately
twenty year old information is Defendant's Exhibit Q, and
depicts a comparison of the percentages of married, gay and
lesbian couples, respectively, which had stayed together or
broken up over periods of time.

Dr. Eggebeen testified that Exhibit Q is the best data that
he could find which proves that gay and lesbian couples
have substantially higher break up rates over time than
married different sex couples. Tr. 9/11/96,-pages 73-74.
Dr. Eggebeen admitted that he has done limited research on
the subject of same sex couples and gay and lesbian
parenting, and agrees that Charlotte Patterson and Pepper
Schwartz are experts in the fields. Tr. 9/11/96, pages
131-132.

55. Finally, and importantly, Dr. Eggebeen stated that
children of same-sex couples would be helped if their
families had access to or were able to receive the
following benefits of marriage: (1) state income tax
advantages; (2) public assistance; (3) enforcement of child
support, alimony or other support orders; (4) inheritance
rights; and (5) the ability to prosecute wrongful death
actions. Dr. Eggebeen also agreed that children of same-sex
couples would be helped if their families received the
social status derived from marriage. Tr. 9/11/96, pages
89-92.

56. Dr. Richard Williams is an expert in the field of
psychology with special expertise in qualitative and
quantitative research and research methods, statistical
analysis and construction of research studies.

57. Dr. Williams was asked by defense counsel to review and
analyze studies of children raised by gay and lesbian
parents. He reviewed approximately twenty to thirty
studies, and eventually selected nine studies to critique.

58. At trial, Dr. Williams presented commentary regarding
nine research studies which defense counsel anticipated
that Plaintiffs' expert witnesses would rely upon for their
testimony and opinions in this case.

Dr. Williams' general criticism of the nine studies
included the following: (1) there was non-representative
sampling of heterosexual, gay and lesbian parents; (2)
inadequate sample size was employed; and (3) comparison
groups used in the studies were not comparable in terms of
household make up. Dr Williams also presented specific
criticism as to each of the nine referenced studies .

59. The testimony of Dr. Williams is not persuasive or
believable because of his expressed bias against the social
sciences, which include the fields of psychology and
sociology.

For example, Dr. Williams believes that a majority of the
studies in the social sciences have theoretical or
methodological flaws. Tr. 9/12/96, pages 71-72. According
to Dr. Williams, modern psychology is so flawed that no
fix, reconciliation or overhaul can correct it. Tr.
9/12/96, page 70.

60. Further, even assuming that research studies are
conducted properly, Dr. Williams still doubts the ultimate
value of psychology and other social sciences. Tr. 9/12/96,
page 73.

61. At times, Dr. Williams expressed severe views. For
example, Dr. Williams believes that there is no scientific
proof that evolution occurred. Tr. 9/12/96, page 80.

62. Finally, Dr. Williams admitted that his critique of
studies regarding gay and lesbian parenting is a minority
position. Tr. 9/12/96, pages 74-75.

63. Defendant's last witness was Thomas Merrill, Ph.D. Dr.
Merrill is an expert in the field of psychology, including
the areas of human development, gender development and
relationships relative to children and their development.

64. Dr. Merrill is a psychologist in private practice in
Honolulu, Hawaii. His clinical experience with families
involving one or two gay or lesbian parents is limited. Dr.
Merrill has not testified as an expert in Family Court
cases which involved the sexual orientation of a parent or
a same-sex couple and the custody of a child. He has not
participated in or conducted any study which focused on the
children of gay and lesbian parents. Tr. 9/13/96, page 36.

65. Dr. Merrill examined the issue of same-sex versus
opposite sex parent and child development for the first
time as a result of his retention in this case. Tr.
9/13/96, page 35.

66. In pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified that the
parental relationship is an important learning model for
children and that it is significant to have opposite sex
parents for a child's learning. Tr. 9/13/96, pages 12-13.

67. Dr. Merrill stated that different-sex parents are
important because both parents serve as models and as
objects for a child's learning and development. Dr. Merrill
explained as follows:


We interact with -- and when I say identify, we measure and
develop ourself in relationship to our same gender parent.
We also identify our relationship with our opposite sex
parents and there are different developmental stages where
that relationship with the opposite sex parent is equal to
or more important than our development -- our relationship
at the moment with the same gender parent.


Tr. 9/13/96, page 13.

68. According to Dr. Merrill, although replacement of a
biological parent is certainly possible, as in the case of
remarriage and adoption, it would result in the presence of
a different influence on the child and the child's
developmental outcome may be different. Tr. 9/13/96, pages
20-21.

69. Dr. Merrill testified that same-sex parents do provide
a learning experience for a child. However, Dr. Merrill
stated that there is insufficient information regarding the
effects of being raised by gay or lesbian parents on the
development of a child. Tr. 9/13/96, page 22.

As a result, Dr. Merrill has no opinion regarding the
development of children in a family with same-sex parents.
Specifically, he cannot say whether or not children raised
in a same-sex family environment will develop to be
healthy, well-adjusted adults. Tr. 9/13/96, page 38.

70. At the close of his direct examination, Dr. Merrill
presented the following opinions.


Q. In your opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological
probability, in what family structure are children most
likely to reach their optimal development?

A. Children are most apt to reach their optimal level of
development as exhibited in terms of their adjustment as
adults in a family in which there is a limited amount of
strife, a maximum amount of nurturing, a maximum amount of
support, a maximum amount of guidance, a maximum amount of
leadership, and a very strong and intimate bond between
parents and child.

Q. And does the presence of the mother and father improve
the likelihood that there will be a strong bond?

A. That would be a significant part of the maximum optimum
environment in which to raise a child, yes.


Tr. 9/13/96, pages 32-33.

71. Dr. Merrill testified that the sexual orientation of a
parent is not an indication of parental fitness. Tr.
9/13/96, page 46.

72. Dr. Merrill also agreed that gay and lesbian couples
with children do have successful relationships. Tr.
9/13/96, page 46.

73. On one occasion, Dr. Merrill was retained by two
attorneys to do a custody evaluation in a case involving a
same-sex relationship on the mother's side. In part, he was
asked to address children's development issues. Dr. Merrill
testified that the fact that there was a same-sex
relationship on the mother's side was not an issue and did
not affect his evaluation in the case. Tr. 9/13/96, page
34.

74. Finally, and in pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified
as follows.


Q. Now, doctor, do you think the children, regardless of
whether they have a mother and a father, male-female
parents, single parents, adoptive parents, gay and lesbian
parents, same gender parents, should have the same
opportunity in society to reach their optimum development,
each child?

A. Yes, I do.


Tr. 9/13/96, page 45.

Dr. Merrill further stated that children should not be
denied benefits, such as health care, education and housing
based on the status of their parents. Opposite-sex,
same-sex, single and adoptive parent status should not be
a basis to deny benefits to children. Tr. 9/13/96, page 46.


V. PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES

75. Although Plaintiffs do not have the burden of proof in
this case, they nevertheless presented testimony from the
following expert witnesses: (1) Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D; (2)
Charlotte Patterson, Ph.D.; (3) David Brodzinsky, Ph.D; and
(4) Robert Bidwell, M.D.

76. The court found the testimony of Dr. Schwartz and Dr.
Brodzinsky to be especially credible.

Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Brodzinsky are well-qualified
individuals. See Plaintiffs' Exhibits 1 and 2,
respectively.

At trial, each of them testified in a knowledgeable,
informative and straightforward manner worthy of belief. In
general, the expert opinions of Dr. Schwartz and Dr.
Brodzinsky appear to be well-founded based on their
significant research and analysis, and their clinical and
professional experience, respectively.

77. Dr. Schwartz is an expert in sociology and
interdisciplinary studies of sexuality with a special
expertise in gender and human sexuality, marriage and the
family, and same-sex relations in parenting and research.
She testified, in pertinent part, to the following.

78. Initially, Dr. Schwartz discussed her book, American
Couples. Dr. Schwartz specifically addressed a chart taken
from the book and relied upon by Defendant. According to Dr
Schwartz, the data contained in Defendant's Exhibit Q
represents the following: (1) that there is a substantially
higher break up rate for all three kinds of couples (gay
men, lesbian and cohabitors) than there is for married
couples; and (2) married couples have an advantage that
keeps them together longer than other kinds of couples. Tr.
9/16/96, pages 47-48.

79. Dr. Schwartz noted that the data presented in American
Couples was collected in the late '70s and up until 1980 or
1981. Since that time, there have been significant changes
in society. For example, the entry of AIDS into gay male
life and society, has made people more cautious and less
likely to have multiple partners and more desirous of
settling down. Gay men, in particular, have been hardest
hit by the disease and it has made monogomy and couplehood
more attractive.

Additionally, there is now a trend in which people
contemplate and want to be more serious, to make families
and to engage in long-term committed relationships. This is
a large change from the attitudes of the late '70s and
early '80s. Tr. 9/16/96, page 54-56.

80. Dr. Schwartz testified that heterosexual and homosexual
people want to get married. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 58-59, 65.
The doctor stated specifically:


[T]hey want companionship, they want love, they want trust,
they want someone who will be with them through thick and
thin. They're looking for a live and a love partner. . . .
[I]n our own [culture] it's an aspiration for --- for
intimacy and security. And that is the definition of
marriage as people first and primarily think of it."


Tr. 9/16/96, page 59.

81. Dr. Schwartz stated that same-sex couples can, and do,
have successful, loving and committed relationships. Tr.
9/16/96, page 129.

82. Dr. Schwartz also identified practical, economic,
legal, social and psychological benefits of marriage and
reasons for people to marry. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 59-65.

83. Dr. Schwartz testified that the sexual orientation of
parents is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr.
9/16/96, page 128.

84. Dr. Schwartz also testified that gay and lesbian
parents and same-sex couples are as fit and loving parents,
as non-gay persons and different-sex couples. Tr. 9/16/96,
page 127.

85. Dr. Schwartz believes that the primary quality of
parenting is not the parenting structure, or biology, but
is the nurturing relationship between parent and child. Tr.
9/16/96, page 129.

86. Dr. Schwartz also believes that children should not be
denied benefits and protections because of the status of
their parents. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 129-130.

87. Dr. Schwartz has the following opinions.

First, there is no reason related to the promotion of the
optimal development of children why same-sex couples should
not be permitted to marry. Tr. 9/16/96, page 130.

Second, allowing same-sex couples to marry would not have
a negative impact on society or the institution of
marriage. Dr. Schwartz testified, "[T]here would be no
dishonor and no ultimate fragility to the institution [of
marriage] by including gays and lesbians." Tr. 9/16/96,
pages 130-131. Third, allowing same-sex couples to marry
would have a positive impact on society and the institution
of marriage. Dr. Schwartz stated the following.


I think that marriage is really a high state of hope and
effort for people. I think when we deny it to people we say
that --- that there's some other location for love and
raising children and that we're not as concerned about
these kids' welfare or in some ways we don't think it would
be good for them to be in a married home. It's not that
those children don't exist, it's not that those families
don't exist, they do.

To me, I think that most Americans believe in marriage
strongly. I believe by taking other people into the fold
and asking that they behave as responsible to their
children to give them support to have both rituals to enter
into their relationships and legal complications by exiting
them, that we shore up how important we think marriage is.
I think it --- I think it in no way undermines it and I
think it strengthens it by our insistence about how
important it is and why we hope this will be available for
all families.


Tr. 9/16/96, pages 131-132.

88. Dr. Charlotte Patterson is an expert in the field of
psychology of child development with a special expertise in
lesbian and gay parenting and the development of children
of lesbian and gay parents. She testified, in pertinent
part, to the following.

89. Dr. Patterson is a professor at the University of
Virginia. She has completed two studies regarding the
children of lesbian and gay parents.

90. The first study is known as the Bay Area Family Study.
The study involved thirty-seven families, all of which had
at least one child between the ages of four and nine. In
every case, the children had either been born to women who
identified themselves as lesbian at the time of the study,
or who adopted children early in life. Data in the Bay Area
Family Study was collected in 1990 and 1991.

91. According to Dr. Patterson, the main result of the Bay
Area Family Study was a conclusion that the particular
group of children, when compared to available norms,
appeared to be developing in a normal fashion. Tr. 9/17/96,
pages 23-24.

However, Dr. Patterson also noted a finding that the
children of the lesbian mothers sample were more likely to
express that they felt (within a normal range) symptoms of
stress in their lives, as compared to children in the
normal sample. The children who described symptoms of
stress also said that they felt an overall sense of
well-being about themselves in their lives. Although she
has two plausible explanations, Dr. Patterson does not have
a definitive interpretation or explanation for the above
finding. Tr. 9/17/96, page 25.

Dr. Patterson agreed that the sample group of lesbian
mothers in the Bay Area Family Study, when considering
ethnic background, education, income, and other
socioeconomic factors is not representative of women and
all mothers in America. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 81-84.

92. Dr. Patterson's second study is known as the
Contemporary Family Study. The study involved eighty
families who conceived a child using the resources of the
Sperm Bank of California. and all of which had at least one
child that was at least five years old at the time of the
study. Fifty-five of the families were headed by lesbian
mothers. The remaining twenty-five families were headed by
heterosexual parents. Most of the data for this study was
collected in 1994 and 1995.

93. The three main conclusions of the Contemporary Family
Study are as follows: (1) as a group, the children born as
a result of donor insemination were developing normally;
(2) sexual orientation of the parents was not a good
predictor of how well children do in terms of a child's
well-being and adjustment; and (3) irrespective of their
parents' sexual orientation, children who live in a
harmonious family environment had better reports from
parents and teachers. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 36-37.

94. Based on her studies and review of other research, Dr.
Patterson testified as follows. A biological relationship
between parent and child is not essential to raising a
healthy child. The quality of parenting which a child
receives is more important than a biological connection or
the gender of a parent. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 42-43.

95. According to Dr. Patterson, there is no data or
research which establishes that gay fathers and lesbian
mothers are less capable of being good parents than non-gay
people and which supports denying gay people the ability to
adopt and raise children. Tr. 9/17/96, page 52.

96. Dr. Patterson believes that gay and lesbian people and
same-sex couples are as fit and loving parents as non-gay
people and different-sex couples. Further, sexual
orientation is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr.
9/17/96, pages 53-54.

97. Dr. Patterson testified that same-sex couples can, and
do, have successful, loving and committed relationships.
Tr. 9/17/96, pages 54.

98. Dr. Patterson presented the following opinion. There is
no reason related to the promotion of the development of
children why same-sex couples should not be permitted to
marry. Tr. 9/17/96, page 55.

99. Dr. David Brodzinsky is an expert in the fields of
psychology and child development with a special expertise
in adoption and other forms of nonbiological parenting and
the development of children raised by nonbiological
parents.

100. Dr. Brodzinsky counsels children and families in a
clinical setting and also has an academic appointment at
Rutgers University. In the academic setting, Dr. Brodzinsky
does research, teaches, directs a program on counseling
foster children and does clinical supervision. He has been
at Rutgers University since 1974.

Dr. Brodzinsky serves as a consultant to several adoption
agencies in New Jersey and New York and is a founding
director of the Adoption Institute, a newly formed
nonprofit organization, whose mission is to provide
information and education and promote research regarding
adoption and adoption practices. In the past ten to fifteen
years, he has conducted research and written extensively on
the psychology of adoption, foster care, stress and coping
in children.

101. In his clinical practice, Dr. Brodzinsky has worked
with gay and lesbian parents. He has provided counseling
over the years to approximately forty families headed by
same-sex parents and same-sex couples. In pertinent part,
Dr. Brodzinsky testified as follows.

102. Dr. Brodzinsky stated the following with respect to
the following question: "Are there advantages to being
raised by one's biological parents?"


The issue is not the structural variable, biological versus
nonbiological, one parent versus two parent. Those are kind
of --- they hide, I think, really what is going on. The
issue is really the process variables, how children are
cared for, is the child provided warmth, is the child
provided consistency of care, is the child provided a
stimulated environment, is the child given support. Those
are the factors we can call, for lack of a better way of
saying it, sensitive care-giving which transcend whether
you're a single parent, two parent, biological,
nonbiological. The research shows that --- that those are
the factors that carry the biggest weight. And when you
take a look at structural variables, there's not all that
much support that structural variable in and of themselves
are all that important.


Tr. 9/18/96, page 42.

103. Dr. Brodzinsky noted that same-sex parent adoptions
occur and it is his opinion that same-sex parent adoptions
should be allowed. Tr. 9/18/96, page 49. Dr. Brodzinsky
explained as follows.


Q. As an expert in adoption and as a psychologist, do you
believe that gay men and lesbians, same-sex couples, should
be continue to be allowed to adopt children?

A. Absolutely.

Q. Why?

A. Because they are able to provide, like heterosexual
couples or single parents, warm and loving environments.
They're --- they're adopting children now. They're doing a
good job of it. Obviously, you know, when we --- when a
person seeks to adopt, there is an evaluation. It would be
the same kind of an evaluation. We would exclude a gay or
lesbian individual for the same reason that we would
exclude a heterosexual individual. That is, if they had a
significant emotional problems or some other kind of factor
that we felt, as -- as, you know, agency consultants, you
know, would not -- would not predict well to a child's
well-being.


Tr. 9/18/96, pages 56-57.

104. Dr. Brodzinsky testified that the research shows that
same-sex couples and different-sex couples can be highly
competent care-givers. The sexual orientation of parents is
not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr. 9/18/96, page 50.

105. According to Dr. Brodzinsky, the primary quality of
good parenting is not the particular structure of the
family or biology, but is the nurturing relationship
between parent and child. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.

106. Dr. Brodzinsky believes that children adopted by
same-sex couples are not at any increased risk for
behavioral or psychological problems. Tr. 9/18/96, page 50.

107. Dr. Brodzinsky expressed his strong view regarding the
issue of whether there is a best family environment to
raise children.


Q. Now, the State's arguments seem to suggest that we
somehow need to identify a best family for children, or as
between mothers and fathers, we have to pick a best parent.
What's your position on that?

A. I find that offensive truthfully. I find it offensive
because it tends to suggest that there's only one way of
being a parent. It excludes all nonbiological parenting
which would be adoptive parenting, stepparenting, foster
parenting, parenting by gay and lesbians. It suggests that
if there are some additional issues that come with some of
these nontraditional families that should be reason for
excluding rather than taking that information and using it
not in a punitive way but in a proactive, kind of
supportive way to help families deal with the inevitable
issues that come up in life. And there are going to be some
unique issues in varying forms of family. But to talk about
one form of family that is best, I find that, you know,
truthfully offensive and a distortion of the research
literature. And that's really why I'm here, you know, to
make sure that message comes across.


Tr. 9/18/96, pages 58-59.

108. Finally, it is Dr. Brodzinsky's opinion that there is
no reason related to the promotion of the development of
children why same-sex couples should not be permitted to
marry. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.

109. Dr. Robert Bidwell is an expert in pediatrics with a
subspecialty in adolescent medicine. Dr. Bidwell is the
Director of Adolescent Medicine at Kapiolani Medical Center
and is also employed at the University of Hawaii Department
of Pediatrics with the John A. Burns School of Medicine.
Dr. Bidwell teaches medical students and pediatric
residents in training, provides patient care, and practices
adolescent medicine and general pediatrics at Kapiolani
Medical Center.

110. In his clinical practice, Dr. Bidwell has treated
children of same-sex parents. He has provided medical
services to hundreds of children with families which
included a single gay or lesbian parent or same-sex
parents. In pertinent part, Dr. Bidwell testified as
follows.

111. Dr. Bidwell described the best environment to raise a
healthy, well-adjusted child or adolescent as being one in
which "there's all those things that we associate with
family, which is love and nurturance and guidance,
protection, safety." Tr. 9/19/96, pages 27-28.

112. According to Dr. Bidwell, gay and lesbian parents and
same-sex couples can, and do, provide an environment for
their children. Tr. 9/19/96, page 29.

113. Dr. Bidwell testified that gay and lesbian parents and
same-sex couples raise children that are just as healthy
and well-adjusted as those raised by different-sex couples.
Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.

114. Dr. Bidwell conceded -- that he has worked with
adolescents and teen-aged children living in a same-sex
family environment that have experienced embarrassment,
distress or a "difficult time" because their family "is not
the same as the majority of families that surround them."
However, the doctor also described the situation as a phase
in the child's development. He said the following.


What's been reassuring to me is that -- that this has been
a phase in their development, that I do not know of any
teenager who has not gotten through this phase intact as a
healthy adolescent. And, yes, I think there was pain. I
think that there may have been tears from time to time,
wishing that things were different. But I think it's -- I
mean it's what we call growing up. I mean there are many
different kinds of families. And all of our parents are
different in some way from what we would like to see. . . .

So I think my experience has been for the same -- has been
the same for the children of gay and lesbian parents, is
that they may go through a rough time. And not all of them
do. Remarkably, most of them, they make their
accommodations. They find ways to deal with it. But they
get through these periods. And if anything, I think they
grow stronger through that experience. They learn about
life. They learn about diversity. And the research -- and
although I'm not a heavy-duty research person, I do look at
the research. The research confirms that --that teenagers
get through this period.

But I guess to get back to your question, yes, there is a
special experience for these young people, and sometimes
it's painful. But it doesn't do developmental damage to
these kids. If anything, it creates strength and promotes
growth.


Tr. 9/19/96, pages 30-32.

115. Finally, Dr. Bidwell believes that children of
same-sex parents would benefit, with respect to their
health, development and adjustment, if their parents were
married. Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.


VI. SPECIFIC FINDINGS

116. The following are specific findings of fact for this
case based on the credible evidence presented at trial.

117. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove any adverse consequences to the
public fisc resulting from same-sex marriage.

118. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove any adverse impacts to the State of
Hawaii or its citizens resulting from the refusal of other
jurisdictions to recognize Hawaii same-sex marriages or
from application of the federal constitutional provision
which requires other jurisdictions to give full faith and
credit recognition to Hawaii same-sex marriages. See
Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution (The Full
Faith and Credit Clause).

119. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed
to establish or prove the legal significance of the
institution of traditional marriage and the need to protect
traditional marriage as a fundamental structure in society.

120. There is a public interest in the rights and
well-being of children and families. See H.R.S. Chapters
571 and 577.

121. A father and a mother can, and do, provide his or her
child with unique paternal and maternal contributions which
are important, though not essential, to the development of
a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child.

122. Further, an intact family environment consisting of a
child and his or her mother and father presents a less
burdened environment for the development of a happy,
healthy and well-adjusted child.

There certainly is a benefit to children which comes from
being raised by their mother and father in an intact and
relatively stress free home.

123. However, there is diversity in the structure and
configuration of families. In Hawaii, and elsewhere,
children are being raised by their natural parents, single
parents, step-parents, grandparents, adopted parents, hanai
parents, foster parents, gay and lesbian parents, and
same-sex couples.

124. There are also families in Hawaii, and elsewhere,
which do not have children as family members.

125. The evidence presented by Plaintiffs and Defendant
establishes that the single most important factor in the
development of a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child is
the nurturing relationship between parent and child.

More specifically, it is the quality of parenting or the
"sensitive care-giving" described by David Brodzinsky,
which is the most significant factor that affects the
development of a child.

126. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of
itself an indicator of parental fitness.

127. The sexual orientation of parents does not
automatically disqualify them from being good, fit, loving
or successful parents.

128. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of
itself an indicator of the overall adjustment and
development of children.

129. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples have the
potential to raise children that are happy, healthy and
well-adjusted.

130. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples are
allowed to adopt children, provide foster care and to raise
and care for children.

131. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can
provide children with a nurturing relationship and a
nurturing environment which is conducive to the development
of happy, healthy and well-adjusted children.

132. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can be as
fit and loving parents, as non-gay men and women and
different-sex couples.

133. While children of gay and lesbian parents and same-sex
couples may experience symptoms of stress and other issues
related to their non-traditional family structure, the
available scientific data, studies and clinical experience
presented at trial suggests that children of gay and
lesbian parents and same-sex couples tend to adjust and do
develop-in a normal fashion.

134. Significantly, Defendant has failed to establish a
causal link between allowing same-sex marriage and adverse
effects upon the optimal development of children.

135. As noted herein, there is a benefit to children which
comes from being raised by their mother and father in an
intact and relatively stress-free home.

However, in this case, Defendant has not proved that
allowing same-sex marriage will probably result in
significant differences in the development or outcomes of
children raised by gay or lesbian parents and same-sex
couples, as compared to children raised by different-sex
couples or their biological parents.

In fact, Defendant's expert, Kenneth Pruett, agreed, in
pertinent part, that gay and lesbian parents "are doing a
good job" raising children and, most importantly, "the kids
are turning out just fine."

136. Contrary to Defendant's assertions, if same-sex
marriage is allowed, the children being raised by gay or
lesbian parents and same-sex couples may be assisted,
because they may obtain certain protections and benefits
that come with or become available as a result of marriage.
See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 59
(1993), for a list of noteworthy marital rights and
benefits.

137. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, same-sex couples can, and
do, have successful, loving and committed relationships.

138. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, people marry for a variety
of reasons including, but not limited to the following: (1)
having or raising children; (2) stability and commitment;
(3) Pmne1onal closeness (4) intimacy and monogamy; (5) the
establishment of a framework for a long-term relationship;
(6) personal significance; (7) recognition by society; and
(8) certain legal and economic protections, benefits and
obligations. See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852
P.2d 44, 59 (1993) for a list of noteworthy marital rights
and benefits.

In Hawaii, and elsewhere. gay men and lesbian women share
this same mix of reasons for wanting to be able to marry.

139. Simply put, Defendant has failed to establish or prove
that the public interest in the well-being of children and
families, or the optimal development of children will be
adversely affected by same-sex marriage.

140. If any of the above findings of fact shall be deemed
conclusions of law, the Court intends that every such
finding shall he construed as a conclusion of law.


CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and
the parties to this action. Venue is proper in the First
Circuit Court. HRS 603-21.5 and 603-36.

2. The trier of fact determines the credibility of a
witness and the weight to be given to his or her testimony.
In pertinent part, the trier of fact may consider the
witness' demeanor and manner while on the stand, the
character of his or her testimony as being probable or
improbable, inconsistencies, patent omissions and
discrepancies in his or her testimony or between the
testimony of other witnesses, contradictory testimony or
evidence, his or her interest in the outcome to the case
and other factors bearing upon the truthfulness or
untruthfulness of the witness' testimony. Younq Ah Chor v.
Dulles, 270 F.2d 338! 341 (9th Cir., 1959); and Nani Koolau
Co. v. Komo Construction, Inc., 5 Haw. App. 137, 139-140,
681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984). In a non-jury trial, the
credibility of a witness is a matter for the trial court to
determine and the court can accept or reject the testimony
of a witness in whole or in part. Lee v. Kimura, 2 Haw.
App. 538, 544, 634 P.2d 1043, 1047-1048 (1981).

3. Defendant's burden in this case is to "overcome the
presumption that HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by
demonstrating that it furthers a compelling state interest
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgements of
constitutional rights." Baehr, 74 Haw. 530, 583, 852 P.2d
44, 74 (1993) citing Naqle v. Board of Education, 63 Haw.
389, 392, 629 P.2d 109, 111 (1987) and Holdman v. Olim, 59
Haw. 346, 349, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978).

4. There is no fundamental right to marriage for same sex
couples under article I, section 6 of the Hawaii
Constitution. Marriage is a state-conferred legal status
which gives rise to certain rights and benefits. Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 557 and 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 57
(1993).

5. The Department of Health, State of Hawaii, has the
exclusive authority to issue licenses to marriage
applicants. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560, 852 P.2d 44,
59 (1993).

6. There are certain rights and benefits which accompany
the state-conferred legal status of marriage See Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (1993) for a
list of noteworthy marital rights and benefits.

7. If Plaintiffs, and other same-sex couples, were allowed
the state-conferred legal status of marriage, they would be
conferred with these and other marital rights and benefits.

8. HRS 572-1, on its face and as applied, regulates access
to the status of marriage and its concomitant rights and
benefits on the basis of the applicants' sex. As such, HRS
Sec. 572-1 establishes a sex-based classification. Baehr v.
Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 572, 852 P.2d 44, 64 (1993).

9. Sex is a "suspect category" for purposes of equal
protection analysis under article I, section 5 of the
Hawaii Constitution. Consequently, HRS 572-1 is subject to
the "strict scrutiny" test. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530,
580, 852 P.2d 44, 67 (1993).

10. Defendant, rather than Plaintiffs, carries a heavy
burden of justification. Nachtwey v. Doi, 59 Haw. 430, 435,
583 P.2d 955, 959 (1978) citing San Antonio School District
v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 36
L.Ed.2d 16, 33 (1973).

11. Specifically, HRS 572-1 is presumed to be
unconstitutional and the burden is on Defendant to show
that the statute's sex-based classification is justified by
compelling state interests and the statute is narrowly
drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional
rights. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 583, 852 P.2d 44, 67
(1993), reconsideration and clarification granted in part,
74 Haw. 645, 646, 852 P.2d 74 (1993).

12. Article IV section 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides,
in pertinent part, that all states must recognize the
"public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every
other state."

Whether other states will recognize or avoid recognizing
same-sex marriages which take place in Hawaii and the
consequences to Hawaii residents of other states'
recognition or non-recognition of same-sex marriage (and
all of the rights and benefits associated with marriage) is
an important issue.

However, except for asking the court to take judicial
notice of the Defense of Marriage Act, P.L. 1-4-199
("DOMA"), Defendant introduced little or no other evidence
with regard to this significant issue of comity and
same-sex marriage, conflict-of-laws, and/or the effects, if
any, of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S.
Constitution.

13. Except for the affidavit testimony of Kenneth K. M.
Ling and Michael L. Meaney, which provided statistical,
budgetary and operational information regarding the Family
Court of the First Circuit Court and the Child Support
Enforcement Agency, State of Hawaii, respectively Defendant
presented little or no other evidence which addressed how
same-sex marriage would adversely affect the public fisc.
Defendant did not offer any testimony which explained the
significance of the above and Defendant did not
specifically explain or establish how same-sex marriage
would adversely impact the Family Court or the Child
Support Enforcement Agency.

14. Defendant presented meager evidence with regard to the
importance of the institution of traditional marriage, the
benefits which that relationship provides to the community
and, most importantly, the adverse effects, if any, which
same-sex marriage would have on the institution of
traditional marriage and how those adverse effects would
impact on the community and society. The evidentiary record
in this case is inadequate to thoughtfully examine and
decide these significant issues.

15. Finally, Defendant's argument that legalized
prostitution, incest and polygamy will occur if same-sex
marriage is allowed disregards existing statutes and
established precedent [for example, State v. Mueller, 66
Haw. 616, 671 P.2d 1351 (1983) (upholding ban on
prostitution)] and the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of
compelling reasons to prevent and prohibit marriage under
circumstances such as incest. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530,
562 n.19, 852 P.2d 44, 59 n.19 (1993).

16. In Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C.App.
1995), two homosexual males filed a complaint against the
District of Columbia which sought an injunction to require
the Clerk of the Superior Court to issue them a marriage
license. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor
of the District of Columbia. On appeal, the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order
granting summary judgment.

In the Dean case, Judge Ferren wrote a lengthy opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part, and in which the
majority joined in part.

Judge Ferren would have reversed summary judgment and
remanded the case for trial to decide (1) the level of
scrutiny constitutionally required, and (2) whether the
District of Columbia has demonstrated a compelling or
substantial enough governmental interest to justify
refusing plaintiffs a marriage license. The portion of
Judge Ferren's opinion which deals with the question of
whether the District of Columbia could demonstrate at trial
a substantial or compelling state interest is useful and
informative. In pertinent part, Judge Ferren wrote the
following.


[I]f the government cannot cite actual prejudice to the
public majority from a change in the law to allow same-sex
marriages . . . then the public majority will not have a
sound basis for claiming a compelling, or even a
substantial, state interest in withholding the marriage
statute from same-sex couples; a mere feeling of distaste
or even revulsion at what someone else is or does, simply
because it offends majority values without causing concrete
harm, cannot justify inherently discriminatory legislation
against members of a constitutionally protected class -- as
the history of constitutional rulings against racially
discriminatory legislation makes clear.

Suppose, on the other hand, that scientifically credible
"deterrence" evidence were forthcoming at trial, so that
either the heterosexual majority or the homosexual minority
would be prejudiced in some concrete way, depending on
whether the marriage statute was, or was not, available to
homosexual couples. In that case, the ultimate question of
whose values should be enforced, framed in terms of what a
substantial or compelling state interest really is, would
pose the hardest possible question for the court as
majority and minority interests resoundingly clash.


Dean at 653 A.2d at 355-356 (1995) (footnotes omitted).

17. In this case, the evidence presented by Defendant does
not establish or prove that same-sex marriage will result
in prejudice or harm to an important public or governmental
interest.

18. Defendant has not demonstrated a basis for his claim of
the existence of compelling state interests sufficient to
justify withholding the legal status of marriage from
Plaintiffs.

As discussed hereinabove, Defendant has failed to present
sufficient credible evidence which demonstrates that the
public interest in the well-being of children and families,
or the optimal development of children would be adversely
affected by same-sex marriage. Nor has Defendant
demonstrated how same-sex marriage would adversely affect
the public fisc, the state interest in assuring recognition
of Hawaii marriages in other states, the institution of
traditional marriage, or any other important public or
governmental interest.

The evidentiary record presented in this case does not
justify the sex-based classification of HRS 572-1.

Therefore, the court specifically finds and concludes, as
a matter of law, that Defendant has failed to sustain his
burden to overcome the presumption that HRS 572-1 is
unconstitutional by demonstrating or proving that the
statute furthers a compelling state interest.

19. Further, even assuming arguendo that Defendant was able
to demonstrate that the sex-based classification of HRS
572-1 is justified because it furthers a compelling state
interest, Defendant has failed to establish that HRS 572-1
is narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessary abridgments of
constitutional rights. Nachtwey v. Doi, 59 Haw. 430, 435,
583 P.2d 955, 958 (1978) (citations omitted) (quoting San
Antonio School District v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93
S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 36 L.Ed.2d 16, 33 (1973).

20. If any of the above conclusions of law shall be deemed
findings of fact, the court intends that each such
conclusion be construed as a finding of fact.

21. Based on the foregoing, in accordance with the mandate
of the Hawaii Supreme Court, and applying the law to the
evidence presented at trial, judgment shall be entered in
favor of Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora Dancel, Tammy
Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon and Joseph Melillo
as follows:


IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT:

1. The sex-based classification in HRS 572-1, on its face
and as applied, is unconstitutional and in violation of the
equal protection clause of article I, section 5 of the
Hawaii Constitution.

2. Defendant Lawrence H. Miike, as Director of Department
of Health, State of Hawaii, and his agents, and any person
in acting in concert with Defendant or claiming by or
through him, is enjoined from denying an application for a
marriage license solely because the applicants are of the
same sex.

3. To the extent permitted by law, costs shall be imposed
against Defendant and awarded in favor of Plaintiffs.

DATED: Honolulu. Hawaii. December 3, 1996.

[Editor's Note: The estate of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. sued CBS for violation of the estate's copyright
on the historic "I Have A Dream" speech. Dr. King delivered the
the speech to a crowd of 200,000 in August 1963, and, according to
the complaint, registered three different versions of the speech
with the U.S. Copyright Office. The King estate alleges that a
videotape on the civil rights movement produced and distributed by
CBS, which includes footage of most of Dr. King's speech, violates
their copyright.]


IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
ATLANTA DIVISION


ESTATE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., INC.,

Plaintiff,

v.

CBS INC.,

Defendant.


CIVIL ACTION

FILE NO. 1 96-CV-3052


COMPLAINT FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT - JURY DEMANDED


JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1.

This is an action for copyright infringement arising under
the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et. seq. This
court has jurisdiction of this action under 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1331 and 1338(a).

2.

Defendant resides or may be found in this district and
venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1391(b) and 1400(a).


PARTIES

3.

Plaintiff, the Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. (the
"Estate"), is a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Georgia, having its principal
place of business in Atlanta, Georgia.

4.

Upon information and belief, Defendant, CBS Inc.
("Defendant"), is a New York corporation with its principal
place of business located at 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
New York. Defendant resides in this district.


BACKGROUND FACTS

5.

The Estate is, and at ail times relevant to the matters
alleged in this complaint has been, the owner of the
copyrights in various speeches and other literary works by
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ("Dr. King"). Among those
works, the copyrights in which are owned by plaintiff, is
the speech titled and universally known as "I Have a
Dream," delivered by Dr. King on the afternoon of August
28, 1963, before some 200,000 people gathered before the
Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

6.

The historic "I Have a Dream" speech was instantly
acclaimed throughout the world and is heralded today as one
of the greatest orations of the Twentieth Century. The
immediate reaction to the speech is, perhaps, best
summarized by an article that appeared on the front page of
The New York Times by James Reston, former Chief of the
Times Washington Bureau, the day following Dr. King's 1963
delivery:

"I Have a Dream" he cried again and again. Each time the
dream was a promise out of our ancient articles of faith:
Phrases from the Constitution, lines from the great anthem
of the nation, guarantees from the Bill of Rights, all
ending with a vision that they might one day all come true.

* * *

Dr. King touched all of the themes of the day, only better
than anybody else.

7.

On or about September 3, 1963, Dr. King registered his "I
Have a Dream" speech with the U.S. Copyright Office, by
mailing a copy of the speech, along with an application
form and check for the requisite registration fees, to the
Copyright Office. Dr. King registered his work as a
"Lecture or Similar Production Prepared for Oral Delivery"
- the category established by the Copyright Office for
speeches. In fact, ultimately three different versions of
Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech were registered with the
Copyright Office to protect against unlawful infringement
by those seeking to profit from his writings. Copies of the
Registrations of Copyright as issued by the U.S. Copyright
Office under Registration Numbers 16099, 653834, and 688840
are attached as Exhibits A, B, and C, respectively.

8.

In the years immediately after the speech was delivered,
would-be profiteers attempted to pirate Dr. King's
copyrighted work for their own financial gain. In October
of 1963, less than two months after the Washington March,
Dr. King was forced to sue a record company for selling
phonographs of "I Have A Dream." In ruling for Dr. King, a
federal court in New York observed that once a speech by
someone "in the forefront of public life" has been
delivered and the "immediate news importance has passed,"
the speech belongs "appropriately to [the] creator." King
v. Mister Maestro Inc., 224 F. Supp. 101, 107 (S.D.N.Y.
1963).

9.

Dr. King's copyrighted works are part of his legacy, and
Dr. King recognized the importance of protecting his
copyrights in his writings. According to records in the
Library of Congress, prior to his death Dr. King personally
registered his copyrights in many other speeches, books,
sermons and articles, including his 1965 "Address at the
Conclusion of the Selma to Montgomery March" and his 1967
"Declaration of Independence from the War in Vietnam."

10.

On December 6, 1991, Coretta-Scott King, as administratrix
for the Estate of Dr. King, renewed the claims of copyright
reflected in the three Registrations of Copyright for the
"I Have a Dream" speech pursuant to the provisions of 17
U.S.C. Sec. 304. Copies of the Certificates of Renewal
Registration as issued by the U.S. Register of Copyrights
to Ms. King are attached as Exhibits D, E, and E.

11.

The Estate is currently, and at all times relevant has
been, the proprietor of the copyrights in the speech "I
Have a Dream," which has been produced and distributed in
conformity with the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976
and all of the laws governing copyright.

12.

Although the Estate and the King family strive to protect
Dr. King's copyrighted works from unauthorized, for-profit
misappropriation, the Estate and the King family
historically and routinely have permitted schools,
charities, and other non-profit organizations to use Dr.
King's copyrighted works on a royalty-free basis.

13.

Defendant is a diversified television entertainment company
with operations throughout the United States.

14.

On information and belief, Defendant, directly or through
a licensee, agent or assign, has produced, distributed and
performed, and continues to produce, distribute and
perform, for the home video, television and other
commercial markets, a video cassette tape (the "Tape
Product") that contains and reproduces the great majority
and the heart of the copyrighted "I Have a Dream" speech.
On information and belief, Defendant sells or authorizes
the sale of videocassette copies of the Tape Product for
profit and licenses its exhibition for profit through
commercial television.

15.

Defendant never obtained permission from the Estate to
market and exploit to the home video or television
industries copies of the "I Have a Dream" speech by means
of the Tape Product. No fee was paid and no acknowledgment
of the Estate's copyrights was included, as required by the
Estate as a condition of any such publication or
exploitation. A copy of the Tape Product is attached as
Exhibit G.

16.

On information and belief, Defendant routinely registers
and vigorously enforces its own copyrights. In fact,
Defendant and its subsidiaries have brought copyright
infringement actions when their own works were infringed.

17.

Defendant's violation of Plaintiff's copyrights in the "I
Have a Dream" speech is contrary to Defendant's scrupulous
efforts to protect and enforce its own copyright interests.
Ironically, Defendant's Tape Product itself begins with a
"WARNING" to all viewers that unauthorized reproduction of
the program contained within would constitute a violation
of federal criminal law.

18.

Exacerbating Defendant's wrongful conduct is the fact that,
without so much as acknowledging Dr. King's registered
copyrights in his "I Have a Dream" speech, which
constitutes the focal point of one of the documentaries in
Defendant's Tape Product, Defendant includes its own notice
of copyright at the conclusion of the program, suggesting
that Defendant is the owner of the copyrighted material
contained in the Tape Product.

19.

Defendant, directly or through a licensee, agent or assign,
knowingly and willfully copied, distributed and performed
for profit the "I Have a Dream" speech, and continues to
engage in these acts.

20.

On information and belief, the Estate has lost and will
continue to lose revenues from the sale of unlawful copies
of the Tape Product containing the "I Have a Dream" speech.
Defendant's wrongful conduct also has deprived and will
continue to deprive the Estate of opportunities for
licensing its copyrights and expanding its goodwill and has
and will create the false and damaging impression that the
work "I Have a Dream" is without copyright protection and
may be copied and exploited freely.

21.

On information and belief, Defendant, directly or through
a licensee, agent or assign, continues to reproduce,
distribute, perform and offer for sale, unlicensed copies
of the Tape Product, despite demands by the Estate and its
counsel that Defendant account to the Estate and enter into
a license as a condition for such further activity.

22.

The natural, probable and foreseeable result of Defendant's
wrongful conduct has been and will continue to be to
deprive the Estate of the benefits of licensing its
copyrights and other products, to deprive the Estate of
goodwill and to injure the Estate's relations with present
and prospective licensees.

23.

As a direct and proximate result of the acts of Defendant
alleged above, the Estate already has suffered irreparable
damage and sustained lost revenues. The Estate has no
adequate remedy at law to redress the injuries that
Defendant has caused. The Estate will continue to suffer
irreparable damage and sustain lost revenues until
Defendant's actions alleged above are enjoined by this
court.

24.

By its actions alleged above, Defendant has infringed and
will continue to infringe the Estate's copyrights in the
speech "I Have a Dream" by producing, distributing,
performing and placing upon the market direct copies of the
work in its Tape Product.

25.

The Estate is entitled to an injunction restraining
Defendant, its officers, agents and employees, and all
persons acting in concert with them, from engaging in any
further such acts in violation of the copyright laws.

26.

The Estate is further entitled to recover from Defendant
the damages, including attorneys' fees, it has sustained
and will sustain, and any gains, profits and advantages
obtained by Defendant as a result of Defendant's acts of
infringement alleged above. At present, the amount of such
damages, gains, profits and advantages cannot be fully
ascertained by the Estate.


REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Estate requests judgment against the
Defendant as follows:

1.

That the court find that Defendant has infringed the
Estate's copyrights in the speech "I Have a Dream."

2.

That the court find a substantial likelihood that Defendant
will continue to infringe the Estate's copyrights in the
speech "I Have a Dream" unless enjoined from doing so.

3.

That Defendant, its officers, directors, agents, servants
and employees, and all other persons in active concert,
privily or participation with them, be enjoined from
directly or indirectly infringing the Estate's copyrights
in the speech "I Have a Dream," or any works derived or
copied from it.

4.

That Defendant be ordered at its expense to affix to each
copy of the Tape Product in its inventory, and upon all
other copies in its possession, custody or control, a
notice in a form, format and location to be approved by
this court, listing all speeches of Dr. King copied in
whole or in part by Defendant, and informing Defendant's
customers that the speech "I Have a Dream" and all such
works of Dr. King are protected by copyright, and that
permission to reprint such speeches and works of Dr. King,
or significant portions thereof, must be secured in writing
from the Estate or its authorized representative.

5.

That Defendant be required to account to the Estate and
this court as to the disposition, and the proceeds
therefrom, of all copies of the Tape Product, and any other
infringed or compromised works or properties of the Estate.

6.

That Defendant be required to account to the Estate and
this court for all gains, profits and advantages derived
from its acts of infringement of the speech "I Have a
Dream" and any other works of the Estate.

7.

That judgment be entered for the Estate and against
Defendant for the Estate's actual damages according to
proof, and for any profits attributable to infringements of
the Estate's copyrights, in accordance with proof.

8.

That judgment be entered for the Estate and against
Defendant for statutory damages in the amount of $100,000
for each violation based upon Defendant's acts of
infringement, pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1976, in
particular 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c).

9.

That the Estate have judgment against Defendant for the
Estate's costs and attorneys' fees as authorized by the
Copyright Act of 1976, in particular 17 U.S.C. Sec. 505.

10.

That the Estate have a trial by jury on all issues triable
to a jury.

11.

That the court grant such other, further and different
relief as the court deems proper under the circumstances.

[Editor's Note: Archer Daniels Midland agreed to pay $100 million
in fines for participating from 1992 through 1995 in a conspiracy
to fix the prices of its lysine and citric acid products.]

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
EASTERN DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

v.

ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY,

Defendant

Criminal No.: 96-CR-00640


PLEA AGREEMENT

Archer Daniels Midland Company, a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter
"ADM" or the "defendant"), the defendant, and the United States
of America, pursuant to Rule 11 (e)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure (hereinafter Fed. R. Crim. P."), hereby enter
into this Plea Agreement, which arises from federal
investigations of violations of federal criminal laws in the
lysine industry, and agree as follows:

RIGHTS OF DEFENDANT

1. The defendant understands its rights:

(a) to be represented by an attorney;

(b) to be charged by Indictment;

(c) to plead not guilty to any criminal charge brought against
it;

(d) to have a trial by jury, at which it would be presumed not
guilty of the charge and the United States would have to prove it
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt;

(e) to confront and cross-examine witnesses against it and to
subpoena witnesses in its defense at trial;

(f) to appeal its conviction if it is found guilty at trial;

(g) to appeal the imposition of sentence against it; and

(h) to be charged in the State and District where the offense
occurred.

WAIVER OF RIGHTS AND OFFENSE CHARGED

2. The defendant waives the rights set out in Paragraphs 1 (b)-
(h) above. Pursuant to Rule 7(b), Fed. R. Crim. P., the defendant
will waive indictment and the United States will file a two-count
Criminal Information to the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois. Count I of the Information will
charge the defendant with participating, from in or about June
1992 until June 27, 1995, in a conspiracy to suppress and
eliminate competition by fixing the price and allocating the
sales volumes of lysine, an amino acid feed additive, in the
United States and elsewhere, in violation of the Sherman
Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. s 1. The defendant understands that the
maximum penalty which may be imposed against it upon conviction
for this violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act is a fine in an
amount equal to the largest of (a) $10 million (15 U.S.C. s 1);
(b) twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from the crime; or (c)
twice the gross pecuniary loss caused to the victims of the crime
(18 U.S.C. s 3571), and a term of probation of at least one year
but not more than five years (18 U.S.C. s 3561(c)(1)). In
addition, the defendant understands that, pursuant to s
8B1.1(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines
(hereinafter "U.S.S.G."), the Court may order it to pay
restitution to the victims of the offense and that 18 U.S.C. s
3013(a)(2)(B) requires the Court to order the defendant to pay a
$200.00 special assessment upon conviction for the charged crime.

3. Count II of the Information will charge the defendant with
participating, from at least as early as January 1993 until June
27, 1995, in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition
by fixing the price and allocating the sales volumes of citric
acid in the United States and elsewhere, in violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. s 1. The defendant understands
that the maximum penalty which may be imposed against it upon
conviction for this violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act is a
fine in an amount equal to the largest of: (a) $10 million (15
U.S.C. s 1); (b) twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from the
crime; or (c) twice the gross pecuniary loss caused to the
victims of the crime (18 U.S.C. s 3571), and a term of probation
of at least one year but not more than five years (18 U.S.C. s
3561(c)(1)). In addition, the defendant understands that,
pursuant to s 8B1.1(a)(2) of the U.S.S.G., the Court may order it
to pay restitution to the victims of the offense and that 18
U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) requires the Court to order the defendant
to pay a $200.00 special assessment upon conviction for the
charged crime.

4. The defendant, pursuant to the terms of this Plea Agreement,
will plead guilty at arraignment to the antitrust criminal
charges described in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, and will make a
factual admission of guilt to the Court in accordance with Rule
11, Fed. R. Crim. P., as set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 below.

FACTUAL BASIS FOR LYSINE OFFENSE

5. Had this case gone to trial, the United States would have
presented evidence to prove the following facts:

(a) The defendant is, and from at least June 1992 until June 27,
1995 ("the relevant time period") was, a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its
principal place of business in Decatur, Illinois. The defendant
is, and throughout the relevant time period was, a producer of
lysine. Lysine is an amino acid feed additive used in poultry and
swine feed in the United States and elsewhere. Throughout the
relevant time period, the defendant was engaged in the sale of
lysine in the United States and elsewhere.

(b) During certain periods of time during the relevant time
period, the defendant, through several of its representatives,
participated in a conspiracy among the major lysine-producing
firms. The primary terms of the conspiracy were to fix the price
of lysine sold in the United States and elsewhere, and to
allocate among the lysine-producing firms the volume of sales of
lysine in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of the
conspiracy, the defendant, through several of its
representatives, engaged in conversations and attended meetings
with representatives of the other major lysine-producing firms.
At one or more of these meetings and during one or more of these
conversations, agreements were reached as to the prices the firms
would charge for lysine in the United States and elsewhere and
the volume of lysine each firm would sell in the United States
and elsewhere. The purpose of the scheme was to restrict the
output and raise the price of lysine in the United States and
elsewhere.

(c) These conspiratorial meetings and conversations took place in
the United States and elsewhere, and at least one of these
meetings, attended by representatives of the defendant, occurred
in this District and Division. During the relevant time period,
lysine sold by one or more of the conspirator firms, and
equipment and supplies necessary to the production and
distribution thereof, as well as payments therefor, traveled in
interstate commerce. The business activities of the defendant and
co-conspirators in connection with the production and sale of
lysine were within the flow of, and substantially affected,
interstate trade and commerce.

(d) Acts in furtherance of this conspiracy were carried out
within the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE CITRIC ACID OFFENSE

6. Had this case gone to trial, the United States would have
presented evidence to prove the following facts:

(a) The defendant is, and from at least June 1992 until June 27,
1995 ("the relevant time period") was, a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its
principal place of business in Decatur, Illinois. The defendant
is, and throughout the relevant time period was, a producer of
citric acid. Citric acid is an organic acid used in various food
products and beverages, cosmetics, medicine, detergents,
chemicals, and textiles in the United States and elsewhere.
Throughout the relevant time period, the defendant engaged in the
sale of citric acid in the United States and elsewhere.

(b) During periods of time during the relevant time period, the
defendant, through several of its representatives, participated
in a conspiracy among the major citric acid-producing firms. The
primary terms of the conspiracy were to fix the price of citric
acid sold in the United States and elsewhere and to allocate
among the citric acid-producing firms the volume of sales of
citric acid in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of
the conspiracy, the defendant, through several of its
representatives, engaged in conversations and attended meetings
with representatives of the other major citric acid-producing
firms. At one or more of these meetings and during one or more of
these conversations, agreements were reached as to the prices the
firms would charge for citric acid in the United States and
elsewhere and the volume of citric acid each firm would sell in
the United States and elsewhere. The purpose of the scheme was to
restrict the output and raise the price of citric acid in the
United States and elsewhere.

(c) These conspiratorial meetings and conversations took place in
the United States and elsewhere. During the relevant time period,
citric acid sold by one or more of the conspirator firms, and
equipment and supplies necessary to the production and
distribution thereof, as well as payments therefor, traveled in
interstate commerce. The business activities of the defendant and
co-conspirators in connection with the production and sale of
citric acid were within the flow of, and substantially affected,
interstate trade and commerce.

(d) Acts in furtherance of this conspiracy were carried out
within the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

SENTENCING GUIDELINES

7. Sentencing for the offenses to be charged will be conducted
pursuant to the U.S.S.G. Manual in effect on the day of
sentencing. The United States and the defendant agree that for
the purposes of determining the U.S.S.G. sentence in this case
the volume of affected commerce attributable to the defendant is
in excess of $100 million both in the lysine market and in the
citric acid market. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. s 1B1.8, self-
incriminating information provided to the United States pursuant
to this Plea Agreement will not be used to increase the volume of
affected commerce attributable to the defendant or in determining
the applicable guideline range.

SENTENCING AGREEMENT

8. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), Fed. R. Crim. P., the United
States and the defendant agree that the appropriate disposition
of the lysine count is, and agree jointly to recommend that the
Court impose, a sentence requiring the defendant to pay a fine,
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3571, to the United States in the amount
of $70 million within 90 days of sentencing and no term of
probation. The fine amount is within the guideline range
calculated from the defendant's volume of affected commerce in
the lysine market. The defendant understands that the Court will
order it to pay a $200.00 special assessment pursuant to 18
U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) and U.S.S.G. s 8E1.1 in addition to any
fine imposed. In light of the restitution already paid or agreed
to be paid by the defendant in case number 95-C-7679, MDL Number
1083, the United States agrees that it will not seek a
restitution order with respect to this count of the Information.

9. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), Fed. R. Crim. P., the United
States and the defendant agree that the appropriate disposition
of the citric acid count is, and agree jointly to recommend that
the Court impose, a sentence requiring the defendant to pay a
fine, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3571, to the United States in the
amount of $30 million within 90 days of sentencing and no term of
probation. The fine amount is within the guideline range
calculated from the defendant's volume of affected commerce in
the lysine market. The defendant understands that the Court will
order it to pay a $200.00 special assessment pursuant to 18
U.S.C. s 3013(a)(2)(B) and U.S.S.G. s 8E1.1 in addition to any
fine imposed. The United States will file a motion pursuant to
U.S.S.G. s 8C4.1 requesting that the Court depart from the
sentence calculated pursuant to the U.S.S.G. and impose the
agreed-upon sentence set out above because of the substantial
assistance provided by the defendant in the investigation of
other corporations and individuals in the citric acid industry.
In light of the restitution already paid or agreed to be paid by
the defendant in case number 95-C-2963, MDL Number 1092, the
United States agrees that it will not seek a restitution order
with respect to this count of the Information.

10. The United States and the defendant believe that this Plea
Agreement contains sufficient information concerning the
defendant, the crimes charged in this case, and the defendant's
role in the crimes to enable the meaningful exercise of
sentencing authority by the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 3553.
The United States will not object to the defendant's request that
the Court accept the defendant's guilty plea and immediately
impose sentence on the day the case is filed notwithstanding the
provisions of Rule 32(b)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P., U.S.S.G. s 6A1.1
and Local Crim. Rule 2.06(C), (D), and (F). The Court's denial of
the request to impose sentence immediately based upon the record
provided by the defendant and the United States will not void
this Plea Agreement.

11. The United States and the defendant understand that the Court
retains complete discretion to accept or reject the agreed-upon
appropriate dispositions provided for in paragraphs 8 and 9 of
the Plea Agreement.

(a) If the Court does not impose the aforesaid agreed-upon
dispositions, the United States and the defendant agree that this
Plea Agreement, except for Paragraph 11(b) below shall be
rendered null and void; and

(b) If the Court does not impose the agreed-upon dispositions
the defendant will be free to withdraw its pleas of guilty
(Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(4)), and, if the defendant does withdraw its
pleas of guilty, this Plea Agreement, the guilty pleas, and any
statements made in connection with or in furtherance of the
pleas or this Plea Agreement, or in the course of
discussions leading to the pleas or the Plea Agreement,
shall not be admissible against the defendant in any
criminal or civil proceeding (Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(e)(6)).


DEFENDANT'S COOPERATION

     12.  The defendant will cooperate with the United
States in  the conduct of (i) the current federal
investigations of alleged offenses committed in furtherance
of, or in connection with, any attempted or completed
antitrust conspiracy, combination, or scheme involving the
sale or production of any product sold or produced by the
defendant's BioProducts Division, Animal Health and
Nutrition Division, Food Additives Division, or Sweetener
Group; (ii) the investigation of the acquisition of

persons available in the United States, at the defendant's
expense, for service of process, interviews, grand jury
testimony, and trial testimony, in connection with any

than Michael D. Andreas and Terrance S. Wilson) (i) for any
act or offense committed prior to the date of this Plea
Agreement and while such person was employed by the
defendant or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, which
was undertaken in furtherance of, or in connection with,
any attempted or completed antitrust conspiracy,
combination, or scheme involving the sale or production of
any product sold or produced by the defendant's BioProducts
Division, Animal Health and Nutrition Division, Food
Additives Division, or Sweetener Group; (ii) for any
alleged misappropriation of technology committed prior to

       (b)  should the United States determine that any
individual subject to Paragraph 14(a) of the Plea Agreement
may have information relevant to any Federal Proceeding,
the United States shall request such person's cooperation
pursuant to the terms of this Plea Agreement by written
request delivered to counsel for the individual (with a
copy to the undersigned counsel for the defendant) or, if
the individual is not known by the United States to be
represented, to the undersigned counsel for the defendant;

       (c)  in the event that any person requested to

       (d)  information provided to the United States by

any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury (18
U.S.C. Sec. 1621), making false statements or declarations
in grand jury or court proceedings (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623),
or obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503);

       (e)  the immunity and non-prosecution terms of this
Paragraph do not apply to any criminal violations of the
federal tax law; and

       (f)  all documents provided pursuant to Paragraph
12(a) will be subject to the protective order already
entered in connection with the investigation of this
matter, and the United States will not disclose any
confidential commercial or financial information or trade
secrets contained in any documents, information, or
material provided pursuant to this Plea Agreement unless
the United States concludes in good faith that such
disclosure is necessary in connection with the conduct of
any Federal Proceeding or is required by law, and will
provide notice to the defendant and an opportunity to be
heard prior to the disclosure of any such information other
than in connection with a grand jury investigation or trial
or other judicial proceeding.

     15.  Upon the tender of the guilty pleas called for by
this Plea Agreement and the imposition and payment of the
agreed-upon sentences called for by this Plea Agreement,
the United States agrees:

       (a)  not to bring further criminal charges against
the defendant or any of the defendant's subsidiaries or
affiliates for any act or offense committed prior to the
date of this Plea Agreement which was undertaken in furtherance

production of any product sold or produced by the defendant's
BioProducts Division, Animal Health and Nutrition Division, Food
Additives Division or Sweetener Group;

(b) not to bring criminal charges against the defendant or of the
defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates for any alleged offense,
committed prior to the date of this Plea Agreement, which is or

defendant's subsidiaries or affiliates, or any current director,
officer or employee of the defendant or of any of the defendant's
subsidiaries or affiliates under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
Sec. 3729 et seq., the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31
U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq., or any other statute within the Civil
Division's authority to release that creates a civil monetary
cause of action for damages or penalties to the United States,
and the common law for any of the matters set forth in Paragraphs
15(a) and 15(b) above. The United States and the defendant agree
that, notwithstanding the release of civil monetary causes of
action, penalties, and claims set forth in this Paragraph, this
Plea Agreement does not release any entity or individual from any
dispute or claim arising under Title 26 of the United States Code
or any administrative action by any federal agency to suspend,

18. The United States agrees that when any person travels to the

ANTITRUST
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
COMMUNICATIONS

[Editor's Note: Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Network challenged the
Time Warner-TBS merger, claiming the deal will restrict cable
programming sales. Fox alleges that Time Warner reneged on an
agreement to carry its new 24-hour news channel, claiming damages
of $250 million to be trebled under antitrust law.]


UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

--------------------------------------------------------

FOX NEWS NETWORK, L.L.C.,

Plaintiff,

- against -

TIME WARNER INC., TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P., TURNER
BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC., and
R.E. "TED" TURNER III,

Defendants.

--------------------------------------------------------


CIV. NO.

COMPLAINT


NATURE OF THE ACTION

          1.   Plaintiff Fox News Network, L.L.C. ("Fox
News") brings this action to enjoin permanently the
proposed merger of Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") and
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  ("Turner Broadcasting").
The merger agreement is a blueprint for the monopolization
of cable television by two cable television giants.  The
merger violates both federal and New York antitrust laws
because it enhances Time Warner's ability and incentive to
abuse its stranglehold over cable television systems to
favor programming in which it has a financial stake, and
thereby reduces competition in the sale of cable
programming in general and all-news cable programming in
particular.  In fact, Time Warner, Turner Broadcasting and
its chairman, R.E. "Ted" Turner, did not even wait until
the proposed merger closed to enter into arrangements that
restrain trade.  As discussed below, prior to the closing,
Turner Broadcasting and Ted Turner entered into an illegal
agreement with Time Warner to deny a competitor of Turner
Broadcasting's CNN -- the Fox News Channel -- access to
viewers served by Time Warner cable systems.  Until the
merger closes, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting are
legally required to operate separately.  It is a violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act for Time Warner, Turner
Broadcasting and Ted Turner to conspire to restrain trade
together in this fashion.

          2.   Fox News launched the Fox News Channel, an
all-news cable programming service, on Monday, October 7,
1996.  The Fox News Channel premiered on cable systems
servicing approximately 17 million subscribers.  Because of
the illegal agreement to restrain trade among Time Warner,
Turner Broadcasting and Turner, Time Warner reneged on
commitments it previously made to Fox News to carry the Fox
News Channel.  Fox News seeks treble damages from Time
Warner, Turner Broadcasting and Ted Turner for the injuries
Fox News has suffered as a result of this illegal
agreement.  Fox News has sustained or will sustain damages
in excess of $250 million.  Under the antitrust laws, such
damages should be trebled for an award of no less than $750
million.  Time Warner's fraudulent misrepresentations
concerning its willingness to carry the Fox News Channel,
and its refusal to live up to the contract it negotiated
with Fox News, also entitle Fox News to recover damages.
Fox News also is entitled to an award of punitive damages
in connection with the fraud perpetrated upon it by Time
Warner to deter such nefarious conduct in the future.  Fox
News asks for an award of one billion dollars in punitive
damages.

          3.   On numerous occasions, Time Warner has
excluded from Time Warner's cable systems, programming
services that competed against programming services in
which Time Warner has an economic interest.  Time Warner
has thus exploited its position as one of the nation's
largest operators of cable television systems, to protect
from competition, cable programming services in which it
has an interest.

          4.   For some time prior to the proposed
acquisition of Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner held an
approximate 20 percent interest in Turner Broadcasting and
thus had a minority interest in CNN, CNNfn and the other
programming services now owned by Turner Broadcasting.  As
demonstrated below, Time Warner has sought to enhance the
value of that 20 percent interest by protecting Turner
Broadcasting programming services from competition from
unaffiliated programmers.

          5.   Time Warner now seeks to acquire the
remaining 80 percent of Turner Broadcasting it does not yet
own.  Ted Turner candidly bragged that the principals to
the transaction hope to use it to suppress competition,
when he responded to questions from reporters after the
proposed Time Warner-Turner Broadcasting merger was
announced.  When Turner was asked about reports that Rupert
Murdoch, Chairman of Fox News's ultimate corporate parent,
The News Corporation Limited ("News Corp."), had indicated
that Fox News intended to start a 24-hour cable news
station to compete against CNN, Turner stated that:


Time Warner is three times as big as News Corp. We're
looking forward to squishing Rupert like a bug.


          6.   Turner's remarks make clear that Turner
Broadcasting and Time Warner are seeking to "squish" the
Fox News Channel not by competing against it on a level
playing field -- by delivering a better product or charging
a lower price -- but by abusing Time Warner's stranglehold
over cable systems to prevent the Fox News Channel from
gaining widespread carriage.  In fact, Turner has expressed
delight with Time Warner's decision not to honor its
agreement to carry the Fox News Channel and the adverse
impact he expects that Time Warner's decision will have on
Fox News.  He recently went so far as to make a public
announcement that in light of the pending merger between
Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting, he advises investors
to "short" the stock of News Corp.  The extent of Turner's
antipathy toward Murdoch was also shown when, upon learning
that Murdoch had complained about Time Warner's breach of
its agreement to carry the Fox News Channel, Turner
compared Murdoch to the "late Fuhrer," Adolf Hitler.

          7.   Turner will have a continuing interest after
the merger in exploiting Time Warner's market power to
stifle competition against CNN and other Turner programming
services.  After the merger, Turner will be Time Warner's
largest voting stockholder and has been promised control
over Time Warner cable business as Time Warner's Vice
Chairman and first "Cable Czar".

          8.   Because of the likely anticompetitive
effects of the merger of Time Warner and Turner
Broadcasting, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")
concluded that the merger would violate Section 7 of the
Clayton Act.  The FTC announced that it would sue to block
the transaction unless the merging parties agreed to a
proposed consent order.  The proposed consent order is now
subject to public comment as required by 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45,
16 CFR Sec. 2.34, but the parties to the merger have
announced that they will not wait until the end of the
comment period to close the transaction.

          9.   The FTC's proposed complaint specifically
alleges that the merger will substantially lessen
competition by increasing Time Warner's direct financial
incentives "as the post-acquisition owner of the Turner
Cable Television Programming Services not to carry other
Cable Television Programming Services that directly compete
with the Turner Cable Television Programming Services."  In
a public statement made on the day the FTC announced the
complaint, FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky singled out the
effect of the merger in reducing competition among all-news
channels.  Chairman Pitofsky referred to CNN as holding a
"monopoly position" and characterized the merger as
"rais[ing] a threat of entrenching the monopoly position of
CNN."  The FTC also issued an "analysis" of the proposed
consent order that highlighted the reduction of competition
in the market for cable news channels by warning that "Time
Warner's acquisition of CNN gives it both the ability and
incentive to make entry of competing news services more
difficult, by denying them access to its extensive
distribution system."

          10.  Between June and sometime in August 1996,
executives at the highest levels of Time Warner and News
Corporation agreed that Time Warner would carry the Fox
News Channel on Time Warner cable systems.  Time Warner and
Fox News reached agreement on the carriage terms.  Under
that agreement, Fox News was to make an up-front payment to
Time Warner in excess of $100 million and Time Warner
obligated itself to offer the Fox News Channel to 90
percent of Time Warner's cable subscribers by 2001.  In
mid-July, Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, publicly announced
that he had been told that Time Warner had concluded an
agreement to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable
systems.

          11.  On information and belief: Ted Turner
discussed various issues concerning programming on Time
Warner cable systems with Time Warner representatives on or
prior to August 30, 1996, including at a meeting with
Gerald Levin at Turner's Montana ranch in late August,
1996; at some point in that period, Turner asked Time
Warner to agree not to carry the Fox News Channel on Time
Warner cable systems and Time Warner agreed.  Not content
to wait until Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting merged to
abuse Time Warner's cable power as a means of suppressing
competition from the Fox News Channel, Turner has solicited
Time Warner's agreement not to carry the Fox News Channel.
On September 24, 1996, The Los Angeles Times quoted
"[s]ources close to Turner [who] say he changed Time
Warner's direction on the deal because he feared it would
give Fox the lead by next year over MSNBC."

          12.  As noted above, the FTC concluded that the
merger, if closed, "would result in a violation of Section
7 of the Clayton Act."  This action by Fox News is needed
because, notwithstanding the substantial lessening of
competition noted by the FTC, the FTC has apparently
decided not to bring suit to enjoin the merger.  Instead,
the FTC has preliminarily settled on a "remedy" which
demonstrably does not prevent the serious and far-ranging
anticompetitive effects that will result from this
transaction.  Only permanent injunctive relief will prevent
substantial injury to competition, to Fox News and to the
public.


JURISDICTION AND VENUE

          13.  This complaint is instituted under Sections
4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, to obtain injunctive relief
and damages for violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act
and Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 15, 18,
and 26; 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1.  The complaint also seeks
injunctive relief and damages resulting from defendants'
violations of the Donnelly Antitrust Act, New York Gen.
Bus. Law Sec. 340, et seq., and New York common law.  This
Court has jurisdiction over the federal antitrust law
claims pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Secs. 4, 16 and 28 U.S.C. Sec.
1337.  The state law claims arise out of the same operative
facts as the federal antitrust claims. Accordingly, this
Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law
claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367.

          14.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over
the corporate defendants because each of the corporate
defendants has consented (by registering with the State of
New York to do business), transacts business, resides,
maintains an office, has agents, or is found in this
District or the State of New York. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 22.
This Court has personal jurisdiction over defendant Ted
Turner because he transacts business, both related and
unrelated to the causes of action set forth herein, in New
York, has committed tortious acts within New York, has
committed tortious acts outside New York causing injury
within New York, and has purposefully availed himself of
the benefits of the laws and commerce of New York.  See
C.P.L.R. Sec. 302 (McKinney's 1995).

          15.  Venue is proper in this district because
each of the defendants transacts business, resides,
maintains an office, has agents or is found in this
district, and the acts complained of arose, in part, in
this district, and have had a substantial anticompetitive
effect in this district.


THE PARTIES

Fox News

          16.  Plaintiff Fox News is a limited liability
corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware with its broadcast studios, corporate offices and
principal place of business located at 1211 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York.  As of the date of filing of
this Complaint, Fox News employs approximately 700 people,
600 of whom are in New York. Once the Fox News Channel
becomes fully established, it is anticipated that the
number of persons Fox News employs will increase to
approximately 1,500, with much of that increase involving
jobs in New York City.  News Corp. or its affiliates have
made substantial capital and other investments in
connection with launching the Fox News Channel.


Time Warner

          17.  Defendant Time Warner Inc. is a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Its
headquarters and principal place of business are located at
75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York.  Time Warner,
together with its corporate affiliates and subsidiaries, is
the largest producer of cable television programming
services in the United States. Time Warner's cable
television programming services include, among others, Home
Box Office ("HBO", which is the single largest programming
service), as well as Cinemax, Court TV, E! Entertainment
Television and Comedy Central.  In 1995, Time Warner's
revenues from all programming services were approximately
$1.5 billion.

          18.  Time Warner, together with its corporate
affiliates and subsidiaries, also is the nation's second
largest operator of cable television systems.  Time Warner
and its affiliates currently provide cable service to
approximately 11.5 million subscribers, or 17% of all
households in the United States that subscribe to cable
television.  Time Warner and its affiliates hold cable
franchises in numerous municipalities and governmental
units throughout the country, including in Manhattan,
Queens, Staten Island and portions of Brooklyn.  In every
territory where Time Warner has a cable franchise, its
cable systems are monopolies.  In fact, Time Warner has
boasted that it has maximized the value of its cable
systems by "clustering" its cable franchises in contiguous
geographic areas in order to insulate itself further from
competition.

          19.  Time Warner's cable systems in New York City
enhance its influence over cable programming across the
country.  That influence arises from the fact that many of
the persons deciding which cable programming services they
will support with advertising dollars live or work in New
York City and receive their primary first-hand exposure
only to the programming services Time Warner elects to
carry on its New York City cable systems.

          20.  In 1995, Time Warner's revenues from cable
system operations were approximately $3.25 billion.


Time Warner Entertainment

          21.  Defendant Time Warner Entertainment, L.P.,
("Time Warner Entertainment") is a Delaware Limited
Partnership.  Time Warner owns 74.49 percent, and U.S. West
owns 21.51 percent, of Time Warner Entertainment.  Time
Warner Entertainment owns and operates the cable
programming services in which Time Warner has an interest
and also has interests in Time Warner's cable systems.
(For ease of reference, Time Warner Entertainment is
sometimes referred to below collectively with Time Warner
Inc. as "Time Warner.")


Turner Broadcasting

          22.  Defendant Turner Broadcasting is a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Georgia, with its headquarters and principal place of
business located at One CNN Center, Atlanta, Georgia 30348.
Turner Broadcasting is the nation's third largest producer
of cable television programming services.  Its programming
services include, among others, the all- news CNN, Headline
News, the TBS Superstation, the Cartoon Network, Turner
Classic Movies, and CNN Financial Network.  According to
the FTC, CNN is viewed by cable system operators as a
"crown jewel" programming service -- a service essential to
attract and retain cable television subscribers.


Ted Turner

          23.  Defendant Ted Turner is the Chairman of
Turner Broadcasting.  Upon information and belief, Ted
Turner is a citizen of the State of Georgia who does
significant business in New York City.


TRADE AND COMMERCE

          24.  At all times relevant, defendants Time
Warner, Time Warner Entertainment, Turner Broadcasting, and
Ted Turner were engaged in commerce as commerce is defined
in Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Sec.
1.


THE MERGER AND ITS ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECTS

          25.  On or about September 22, 1995, Time Warner
and Turner Broadcasting entered into an agreement (the
"Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Time Warner would
acquire the approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of
Turner Broadcasting that it did not already own.  At the
time the Merger Agreement was executed, the market value of
the transaction was approximately $6.7 billion.

          26.  Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting are the
first and third largest producers of cable programming.
Accordingly, post-merger Time Warner will control more than
40% of the cable television programming market, including
several "crown jewels," such as HBO and CNN.

          27.  As a result of the far-reaching horizontal
and vertical combinations caused by the merger, Time Warner
will have the clear market power and strong economic
incentives to lessen competition substantially.  Time
Warner will have a direct financial incentive, as the post-
acquisition owner of Turner Broadcasting's programming, not
to carry any programming that directly competes with
programming already offered by Turner Broadcasting.

          28.  The inevitable result of these economic
realities is that Time Warner will foreclose -- as it has
done in the past and is doing today -- the launch and
distribution of unaffiliated cable programming.

          29.  With its monopoly stranglehold over 17
percent of the nation's cable subscribers, Time Warner can
refuse to carry existing cable television services that
compete with Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting
programming.  With control over the key New York City
market, Time Warner also can prevent the launch of
potentially successful new cable programming.  In short,
following the acquisition, Time Warner will have the power,
the incentive and, as has been demonstrated, the will to
squelch any and all serious competition with the
programming offered by Time Warner.


TIME WARNER'S RECORD OF ANTICOMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR

          30.  Time Warner's prior record of
anticompetitive behavior only increases the likelihood that
it will exploit the power gained from its acquisition of
Turner Broadcasting to foreclose entry by competing
providers into the cable programming market.

          31.  Historically, Time Warner has taken steps to
stifle competition with programming services in which it
has an interest.  For example, Time Warner refused to
provide channel space on its cable television systems to
movie networks such as Viacom's Showtime, which competed
against Time Warner's HBO and Cinemax services.  Competing
programmers such as Viacom were forced to bring suit to
force Time Warner to open its cable systems to them.  Only
after litigation did Time Warner agree to give Showtime
access to Time Warner systems.  In fact, Time Warner
ultimately did so as part of a settlement agreement that
required Time Warner to pay tens of millions of dollars to
Viacom for having kept Showtime off its system so long.
Likewise, Time Warner refused to carry the Bravo movie
channel on its cable systems until a federal District Court
Judge ordered it to do so in litigation brought by a
citizens group.

          32.  More recently, Time Warner has announced
that it will drop the Classic Sports Network -- a
programming service in which it has no financial interest
-- from many of its cable systems to make room for a
competing Time Warner network.  The Classic Sports Network
gained enormous popularity during the short time it was
carried on Time Warner systems. Nevertheless, Time Warner
has announced that it will replace Classic Sports with
CNN-SI, a new joint venture between the Turner
Broadcasting's CNN and Time Warner's "Sports Illustrated."

          33.  Finally, the foreclosure of Fox News from
Time Warner's distribution network was foreshadowed by Time
Warner's refusal to carry the fX channel.  News Corp.
launched fX in 1994 to bring viewers a fresh mix of live
and classic programming.  The fX channel has proven
successful and has achieved ratings that surpass the
ratings for many channels on Time Warner's cable systems.
Nevertheless, Time Warner -- which controls the cable
systems serving the vast majority of New York City cable
subscribers -- has refused to carry fX, or its subsequently
launched affiliate, fXM.  Richard Aurelio, President of
Time Warner's New York City cable systems, recently stated
that the Time Warner systems did not have the capacity to
carry all available cable programming services.  But Time
Warner's systems have capacity for Time Warner products
like CNNfn and CNN-SI.  Time Warner uses its cable
distribution system to offer its own programming services
and to block others that pose competitive threats.  After
the merger closes, Time Warner will have sufficient channel
space to find room for approximately 14 programming
services in which it has an economic interest.


FOX NEWS'S EFFORT TO OBTAIN CARRIAGE OF THE FOX NEWS
CHANNEL ON TIME WARNER CABLE SYSTEMS

          34.  When Time Warner's proposed acquisition of
Turner Broadcasting was announced, Turner's CNN had no
serious competition in the market for all-news cable
programming.  Nevertheless, CNN was vulnerable to strong
competition.  Because much of CNN's profitability was based
on its unique position as the only programmer providing
24-hour news service, even a small dip in its viewing
audience could significantly erode its profits.

          35.  In January 1996, Fox News officially
announced its plan to compete with CNN by creating the Fox
News Channel, a 24-hour-a-day, professionally produced,
high-quality worldwide cable television service consisting
entirely of national and international news.  To this end,
Fox News hired as President of the Fox News Channel Roger
Ailes, a veteran cable programming executive who had
launched and run two other cable programming services.

          36.  According to news reports, Ted Turner had
this to say when asked about reports that Rupert Murdoch
had announced the launch of the Fox News Channel as a new
competitor to Turner's CNN:   Time Warner is three times as
big as News Corporation.  We re looking forward to
squishing Rupert like a bug.   Thus, according to Ted
Turner, CNN would not eliminate the Fox News Channel by
competing on a level playing field. Rather, CNN would rely
on Turner Broadcasting's impending marriage to Time Warner
and Time Warner's stranglehold on cable television systems
to combat the Fox News Channel.


FOX NEWS'S CARRIAGE AGREEMENT WITH TIME WARNER

          37.  Because the Fox News Channel's success in
the market for all-news cable programming depends on its
ability to secure widespread distribution, Fox News entered
into negotiations with numerous cable television system
operators to obtain carriage agreements. Because of Time
Warner's dominant position as a distributor of programming
and the special influence it exercises over the ability of
cable programming services to attract advertising by virtue
of the strategic importance of Time Warner's New York City
cable television systems, Fox News negotiated and sought to
reach a carriage agreement with Time Warner for the Fox
News Channel.

          38.  In or about June 1996, Rupert Murdoch and
Chase Carey, Chairman and Chief Executive of Fox
Television, met with Time Warner's Gerald Levin and Richard
Parsons to discuss, among other things, the possibility
that Time Warner would carry the Fox News Channel
nationwide.  During this meeting, it was emphasized to
Levin and Parsons that Fox News placed significant
importance on the carriage of the Fox News Channel on Time
Warner's cable television systems throughout the United
States and in New York City in particular.

          39.  Following this discussion, and at Levin's
suggestion, Carey called Joe Collins, a Time Warner senior
executive, to schedule a meeting at which the parties could
discuss a carriage agreement further, as Fox News planned
an October 7, 1996 launch date for the Fox News Channel.
Collins stated that the discussions should include Fred
Dressler, the vice president of programming for Time
Warner's cable systems.

          40.  In or about July 1996, Carey and Ailes had
meetings with Dressler and Collins to outline the terms of
a proposed carriage agreement. Dressler and Collins
confirmed to Carey and Ailes that the terms of Fox News's
proposal provided the basis for negotiating a deal.

          41.  Fox News representatives then drafted a
letter agreement outlining the terms of a carriage
agreement and delivered it to Time Warner representatives
on or about July 18, 1996. Levin personally represented to
Murdoch that Fox News's proposal was acceptable to Time
Warner and that the parties should proceed to finalize an
agreement.  At or about that same time, Robert Wright, CEO
of NBC, announced publicly that he had been told that Time
Warner had concluded a carriage agreement with Fox News.

          42.  Several days later, Richard Aurelio
confirmed that Time Warner and Fox News had been
negotiating and that it was  inevitable  that Time Warner
would "do a deal" with Fox News.  This public statement was
consistent with Time Warner representatives  private
comments to Fox News's representatives throughout this
period.

          43.  Shortly thereafter, Fox News representatives
met several times with Dressler to present and discuss a
draft cable television affiliation agreement.  At one of
those meetings, Dressler expressed appreciation for the
speed with which Fox News had prepared the agreement, and
for the agreement's thoroughness.  During this period,
Dressler represented that closing the deal with Fox News
was Time Warner's second highest priority -- second only to
obtaining FTC approval for its proposed acquisition of
Turner Broadcasting.  The parties exchanged several drafts
of the carriage agreement.  Throughout this process,
Dressler repeatedly assured Fox News that the parties "had
a deal."


TED TURNER'S EFFORTS TO SECURE TIME WARNER'S AGREEMENT NOT
TO PROCEED WITH THE TIME WARNER-FOX NEWS CARRIAGE AGREEMENT

          44.  On information and belief: by late August,
Turner discussed with Time Warner representatives the
pending agreement for Time Warner to carry the Fox News
Channel; Turner and Time Warner management agreed that Time
Warner would reverse course and renege on Time Warner's
done deal  with Fox News to carry the Fox News Channel;
Turner and Time Warner reached this understanding for no
other reason than to stifle competition from the Fox News
Channel.  According to subsequent reports,  [s]ources close
to Turner say he changed Time Warner's direction on the
[Fox News Channel] deal because he feared it would give Fox
[News] the lead by next year over MSNBC."  Time Warner said
nothing to Fox News regarding the secret Time Warner
agreement with Turner Broadcasting and Ted Turner.

          45.  On or about August 30, 1996, Fox News
presented Time Warner with an agreement containing all of
the material terms to which the parties had agreed.  At
that time, Dressler told Fox News representatives that Time
Warner's attorneys had advised it to postpone signing the
parties' carriage agreement so as not to jeopardize the
FTC's review of Time Warner's proposed acquisition of
Turner Broadcasting.  At the same time, Dressler repeated
his representation that Time Warner and Fox News had a
"done deal" with respect to the Fox News Channel.


THE FTC'S ANALYSIS OF THE MERGER

          46.  During much of the time that Time Warner was
assuring Fox News that the Fox News Channel would be
carried on Time Warner systems, Time Warner was negotiating
to obtain the FTC's acquiescence in its proposed
acquisition of Turner Broadcasting.

          47.  On September 12, 1996, the FTC issued a
draft Complaint charging that the merger, would, if
consummated, violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.  The FTC
charged that the effect of the merger, "if consummated, may
be substantially to lessen competition in the relevant
lines of commerce in the relevant sections of the country
in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,  by, among
other things,  enabling . . . Time Warner to increase
prices on its Cable Television Programming Services sold to
MVPDs [Multichannel Video Program Distributors, such as
cable system operators] by raising barriers to entry by new
competitors or to repositioning by existing competitors, by
preventing such rivals from achieving sufficient
distribution to realize economies of scale.

          48.  According to the FTC, anticompetitive
effects will likely result from the proposed merger
because:


-- . . . Time Warner has direct financial incentives as the
post-acquisition owner of the Turner Cable Television
Programming Services not to carry other Cable Television
Programming Services that directly compete with the Turner
Cable Television Programming Services. . .


          49.  In a separate analysis accompanying the
draft complaint, the FTC summarized its core allegations as
follows:


[T]he acquisition, along with related transactions, would
allow Time Warner unilaterally to raise the prices of cable
television programming and would limit the ability of cable
television systems that buy such programming to take
responsive action to avoid such price increases.  It would
do so . . . both through horizontal combination in the
market for cable programming (in which Time Warner, after
the acquisition, would control about 40% of the market) and
through higher entry barriers into that market as a result
of the vertical integration (by merger and contract)
between Turner's programming interests and Time Warner's
and TCI's cable distribution interests.


          50.  According to Chairman Pitofsky and
Commissioners Steiger and Varney, the Commission received
evidence that these foreclosure threats were real and
substantial.  There was clearly reason to believe that this
acquisition would increase the incentives to engage in this
foreclosure without remedial action.

          51.  The FTC noted that the vertical foreclosure
problems raised by the proposed merger were particularly
troublesome in the market for all-news programming, where
CNN held what Chairman Pitofsky called a "monopoly
position."  According to the FTC:


Of the types of programming in which the post-merger Time
Warner will have a leading position, the one with the
fewest existing close substitutes is the all-news segment,
in which CNN is by far the most significant player.  There
are actual or potential entrants that could in the future
erode CNN's market power, but their ability to do so is
partly dependent on their ability to secure widespread
distribution.  Without access to Time Warner's extensive
cable holdings, such new entry may not be successful.  Time
Warner's acquisition of CNN gives it both the ability and
incentive to make entry of competing news services more
difficult, by denying them access to its extensive
distribution system.


          52.  Chairman Pitofsky highlighted this likely
anticompetitive effect on September 12, 1996, when he said
that  [w]hat we are saying was that now that CNN, which
dominates cable news, is owned by somebody [Time Warner]
who has something like 17% or more of the cable subscribers
in the country, that raises a threat of entrenching the
monopoly position of CNN.

          53.  Notwithstanding these substantial
anticompetitive effects, the FTC preliminarily decided not
to file suit to enjoin the proposed merger's consummation.
Rather, the FTC entered into a proposed  Agreement
Containing Consent Order  ("proposed consent order") with
the merging parties that was issued for public comment on
September 26, 1996. The public comment period will not
expire until on or about November 22, 1996.  The FTC's
proposed consent order would provide only limited and
ineffective relief from the anticompetitive effects of the
merger.  As a result, Fox News was forced to bring this
lawsuit.

          54.  For example, to remedy the anticompetitive
effect of Time Warner's post-merger ability and incentive
to block the entry of a competing all-news service,
Paragraph IX of the proposed consent order would require
Time Warner to place a news channel on certain of its cable
systems at specified roll-out and market penetration rates.
Specifically, if Time Warner chooses to fulfill Paragraph
IX by increasing carriage for an existing channel, it must
achieve penetration of 50% of total basic subscribers by
July 30, 1999.  Alternatively, if Time Warner seeks to
fulfill this provision by carrying a channel not currently
carried by Time Warner, it must achieve penetration of 50%
of total basic subscribers by July 30, 2001.  In short,
Paragraph IX's remedy  is to allow Time Warner to establish
a duopoly in all-news programming on Time Warner cable
systems reaching just 50% of its subscribers, and to enjoy
a CNN monopoly in the other 50%.


Time Warner's Carriage of MSNBC

          55.  Shortly after the FTC issued its complaint
and proposed consent order, Time Warner advised Fox News
for the first time that it would not honor its agreement to
carry the Fox News Channel.  Time Warner told Fox News that
it had decided to carry the mixed format MSNBC as its sole
"all-news" alternative to CNN.  Further, Time Warner
maintained that MSNBC satisfied the requirements for being
an all-news service in Paragraph IX of the proposed consent
order.

          56.  MSNBC does not meet the requirements in
Paragraph IX, because it is not a "24-hour per day service
consisting of current national, international, sports,
financial and weather news and/or information, and other
similar programming."  In fact, MSNBC itself claimed that
it is not an all-news service when it was arguing with
cable systems over whether MSNBC could utilize carriage
rights granted to its predecessor, America's Talking. Even
after MSNBC premiered, its management described it in ways
that make clear that it is not a true competitor of CNN and
fails to meet the requirements of Paragraph IX of the
proposed consent order:  Andrew Lack, NBC News President,
described criticism of MSNBC's failure to provide
programming similar to CNN as "stupid" because "I said
since day one that we are not going to do CNN."

          57.  Time Warner's agreement to carry MSNBC
exposes the insufficiency of the proposed consent order to
remedy the harms to competition identified by the FTC.  The
proposed consent order requires only that Time Warner
distribute a single all-news alternative on Time Warner
cable systems reaching 50 percent of Time Warner's
subscribers by July 30, 1999, abandoning the remaining 50
percent to an all-news monopoly.  On information and
belief, Time Warner misled the FTC by representing that
Time Warner could only offer 50 percent of its viewers a
competing all-news channel by that date.  In fact, the
proposed consent order requires Time Warner to provide a
second all-news channel to fewer cable subscribers than
required by the Time Warner-Fox News agreement.

          58.  Time Warner's plan to allow MSNBC to reach
3.5 million Time Warner subscribers by July 1, 1997 leaves
50 percent fewer Time Warner subscribers able to enjoy a
second all-news channel as of that date than the agreement
with Fox News would require. Similarly, Time Warner's plan
to allow MSNBC to reach 5.75 million Time Warner
subscribers by July 30, 1999 affords the benefits of a
second all-news channel to 60 percent fewer subscribers as
of that date than the agreement with Fox News would
require.  In short, by reneging on the agreement to carry
the Fox News Channel, Time Warner will insulate CNN from
meaningful competition.

          59.  Significantly, when Murdoch expressed
disappointment over Time Warner's breach of its agreement
to carry the Fox News Channel, Ted Turner launched another
intemperate attack on Murdoch.  Specifically, Turner
compared Murdoch to the "late Fuhrer" and described
journalists who work for Murdoch as "yellow journalists."
Turner also claimed that Murdoch's global media holdings
are "like Germany in 1942 with black lines across Europe."
According to Turner, the merged entity of Time Warner and
Turner is "like 1944, and the Americans are coming in."
Turner's offensive and absurd analogy and Time Warner's
steadfast refusal to carry the Fox News Channel reveal the
true motivation behind the proposed Time Warner-Turner
merger -- to use the market power of the post-merger Time
Warner to further foreclose legitimate and robust
competition from Fox News and other competitors.  As noted
above, Turner evidently anticipates that he will be able to
abuse Time Warner's vertically integrated monopoly power to
follow through on his threat to "squish" News Corporation
and Fox News:  He recently recommended that investors
"short" News Corp.'s stock.


TIME WARNER'S CONTINUING REFUSAL TO PROVIDE THE FOX NEWS
CHANNEL TO NEW YORK CITY SUBSCRIBERS

          60.  Time Warner's anticompetitive intent is
reconfirmed by its refusal even to consider the City of New
York's recent request for permission to carry the Fox News
Channel on one of the five municipal-access cable channels
the City controls.  Even though Time Warner would incur no
costs in connection with the City's proposal, it has
rejected the City's request due to its desire to keep the
Fox News Channel out of New York and thereby to prevent the
Fox News Channel from reaching Time Warner's 1.1 million
New York City subscribers.  As Time Warner knows,
distribution to this market of subscribers is critical to
the Fox News Channel's ability to succeed.


RELEVANT MARKETS

          61.  There are three product markets that are
relevant to this action: (a) the market for the sale of all
cable television programs to multi-channel video
programming distributors, which enables MVPDs to purchase
cable television programming from producers such as Fox
News, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting and, in turn, to
retransmit those programs to subscribers in their systems;
(b) the market for the sale of all-news cable programming
to MVPDs, in which MVPDs purchase all-news cable
programming for retransmission to subscribers in their
systems; and (c) the market for the sale of multiple
channels of video programming services to households (the
"MVPD market").

          62.  The cable television programming services
market is relevant because over- the-air broadcast
television, video cassette rentals, and other forms of news
and entertainment do not have a sufficient price
constraining effect on the sales of cable television
programming services to MVPDs.

          63.  The all-news cable programming services
market is relevant because the demand for such programs is
highly inelastic.  All-news cable programming is unique in
that it provides comprehensive and up-to-the-minute
reporting of domestic and international news, sports,
business and weather, supplemented with in-depth reports,
analysis and commentary. Because of the unique content and
features of all-news cable shows, MVPD customers do not
view other types of cable programming as suitable
substitutes for all-news cable programming.  In determining
the mix of cable programming to distribute to their
customers, therefore, MVPDs have a particular and distinct
demand for all-news cable programming, and do not view
other types of cable programming as suitable substitutes
for such all-news programming.

          64.  The geographic dimensions of the relevant
markets in this action are as follows:  (a) the United
States for the cable television programming and all-news
cable programming markets; and (b) the geographic area
encompassed within each governmentally awarded cable
television franchise for the MVPD market.

          65.  The local areas in which MVPDs retransmit
cable television programming are relevant markets because
MVPDs provide cable programming to subscribers within
franchise territories defined by state or local
governmental entities.  Accordingly, MVPD customers
typically purchase their cable programming services
exclusively from the MVPD franchised in the defined
territories in which the customers live.  MVPDs in one
defined franchise territory do not compete with MVPDs in
another defined franchise territory.  Moreover, the same
MVPD operating in different franchise territories may
purchase different cable programming for distribution in
each separate territory for distribution to their separate
groupings of customers. Each state or locally-drawn
franchise territory, therefore, is a relevant geographic
market.


COUNT I
FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT, 15 U.S.C.
Sec. 18 AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS

          66.  Fox News repeats and realleges each and
every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 with
the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.

          67.  The effect of the merger of Time Warner and
Turner Broadcasting may be substantially to lessen
competition in interstate trade and commerce in violation
of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, U.S.C. Sec. 18, in the
following ways, among others: It will decrease competition
in the cable television programming market and the all-news
cable television programming market by providing the
combined Time Warner-Turner Broadcasting entity with the
ability and the incentives to exploit Time Warner's power
in the MVPD and programming markets to restrict access to
cable television subscribers by providers of cable
programming services and thereby redound to the detriment
of not only Fox News and other vendors of cable programming
services, but also consumers of cable television.  To
eliminate these anticompetitive effects, the merger should
be permanently enjoined.


COUNT II
(FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AGAINST ALL
DEFENDANTS)

            68.  Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
complaint with the same force and effect as if fully set
forth herein.

            69.  The agreement between Ted Turner, Turner
Broadcasting and Time Warner that Time Warner would not
carry the Fox News Channel is an unlawful combination and
conspiracy in restraint of trade and thus constitutes a
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec.
1.

            70.  As a direct and proximate result of this
unlawful combination and conspiracy, interstate commerce
has been and will be restrained and impeded in the
following respects, among others: (a) substantial barriers
to entry into, and participation in, the markets for cable
television programming services and for all-news cable
television programming services will be erected and
maintained in the relevant markets; and (b) the Fox News
Channel will be restrained and prevented from competing
effectively with CNN.

            71.  Cable television subscribers have been and
will continue to be adversely affected as a result of this
unlawful combination and conspiracy.

            72.  By reason of the unlawful combination and
conspiracy described in this Count, Fox News has sustained
or will sustain damages in the amount of at least
$250,000,000 prior to trebling.

            73.  As a result of the continuing nature of
the unlawful combination and conspiracy described in this
Count, Fox News has suffered and will continue to suffer,
unless the activities complained of are enjoined, immediate
and irreparable injury and damage to its business,
including loss of business, goodwill and revenue, for which
Fox News is without an adequate remedy at law.


COUNT III
(FOR VIOLATION OF THE DONNELLY ACT - CONSPIRACY AGAINST ALL
DEFENDANTS)

            74.  Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
complaint with the same force and effect as if fully set
forth herein.

            75.  The effect of the merger of Time Warner
and Turner Broadcasting may be substantially to lessen
competition in interstate and intrastate trade and commerce
in violation of the Donnelly Act, New York General Business
Law Sec. 340, et seq., in the following ways, among others:
It will decrease competition in the cable television
programming market and the all-news cable television
programming market services by providing the combined Time
Warner-Turner Broadcasting with the ability and incentive
to exploit Time Warner's power in the MVPD and programming
markets to restrict access to other cable television
programming services or other all-news cable television
programming services that compete with Time Warner and
Turner Broadcasting cable television programming services.

            76.  Cable television subscribers have been and
will continue to be adversely affected as a result of the
unlawful combination and conspiracy described in this
Count.

            77.  By reason of the unlawful combination and
conspiracy described in this Count, Fox News has sustained
or will sustain damages in the amount of at least
$250,000,000 prior to trebling.

            78.  As a result of the continuing nature of
the unlawful combination and conspiracy described in this
Count, Fox News has suffered and will continue to suffer,
unless the activities complained of are enjoined, immediate
and irreparable injury and damage to its business,
including loss of business, goodwill and revenue, for which
Fox News is without an adequate remedy at law.


COUNT IV
(FOR VIOLATION OF THE DONNELLY ACT - CONSPIRACY AGAINST ALL
DEFENDANTS)

            79.  Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
complaint with the same force and effect as if fully set
forth herein.

            80.  The agreement between Ted Turner, Turner
Broadcasting and Time Warner that Time Warner would not
carry the Fox News Channel is an unlawful combination and
conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the
Donnelly Act, New York General Business Law Sec. 340, et
seq.

            81.  As a direct and proximate result of this
unlawful combination and conspiracy, interstate commerce
has been and will be restrained and impeded in the
following respects, among others: (a) substantial barriers
to entry into, and participation in, the markets for cable
television programming services and for all-news cable
television programming services will be erected and
maintained in the relevant markets; and (b) the Fox News
Channel will be restrained and prevented from competing
effectively with CNN.

            82.  Cable television subscribers have been and
will continue to be adversely affected as a result of the
unlawful combination and conspiracy described in this
Count.

            83.  By reason of the unlawful combination and
conspiracy described in this Count, Fox News has sustained
or will sustain damages in the amount of at least
$250,000,000 prior to trebling.

            84.  As a result of the continuing nature of
the unlawful combination and conspiracy described in this
Count, Fox News has suffered and will continue to suffer,
unless the activities complained of are enjoined, immediate
and irreparable injury and damage to its business,
including loss of business, goodwill and revenue, for which
Fox News is without an adequate remedy at law.


COUNT V
(FOR FRAUD AGAINST TIME WARNER, INC. AND TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.)

            85.  Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
complaint with the same force and effect as if fully set
forth herein.

            86.  During June, July and August 1996, as
described above in paragraphs 37 through 45 of the
complaint, Time Warner representatives made a series of
representations to Fox News representatives that Fox
intended to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable
television systems and intended to sign a written carriage
agreement with Fox News to carry the Fox News Channel.

            87.  Upon information and belief, the Time
Warner representatives knew or should have known that Time
Warner would not live up to these representations.

            88.  Upon information and belief, at some point
in July or August 1996, Time Warner representatives agreed
with Turner and Turner Broadcasting that Time Warner would
not carry the Fox News Channel; Time Warner reached that
decision pursuant to an agreement with Turner and Turner
Broadcasting.

            89.  On information and belief, the Time Warner
representations described above that Time Warner was going
to carry the Fox News Channel were false at the time they
were made.

            90.  On information and belief, Time Warner and
its agents made such representations to Fox News and its
agents to induce Fox News to rely on those representations.
In particular, Time Warner hoped to hinder Fox News'
ability to compete with CNN by lulling Fox News into a
false belief that Fox News would be carried on Time
Warner's systems.

            91.  The falsity of these representations was
unknown to Fox News at the time they were made.  Fox News
substantially and reasonably relied to its detriment on
Time Warner's promise to carry the Fox News Channel on Time
Warner's cable television systems.  By advising Fox News
just three weeks prior to its planned launch date for the
Fox News Channel that it would not perform its agreement
and carry the Fox News Channel, Time Warner has made it
impossible for Fox News to achieve the widespread
distribution of the Fox News Channel in New York City and
in other areas that were important to Fox News's launch
strategy.  If Fox News knew that Time Warner did not intend
to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable television
systems, which are monopolies in every one of their
franchise areas, including those in New York City, Fox News
would have pursued more aggressively contracts with other
cable system operators to secure desired distribution
levels at the launch date.

            92.  As a result of the false representations
and Fox News's reliance on them, Fox News has sustained or
will sustain damages in an amount to be determined more
precisely at trial, but believed to be at least
$250,000,000.

            93.  The false representations were made
willfully with malicious intent to defraud Fox News.
Accordingly, Fox News is entitled to an award of punitive
damages.  Fox News seeks a punitive damages award of one
billion dollars.


COUNT VI
(FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AGAINST TIME WARNER INC. AND TIME
WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.)

            94.  Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

            95.  By August 30, 1996, Fox News and Time
Warner entered into an agreement whereby Time Warner would
carry the Fox News Channel on its cable television
operating systems beginning on or about October 7, 1996.

            96.  But for Time Warner's breach of their
agreement, Fox News was ready to perform all of its
obligations under its agreement with Time Warner.

            97.  By virtue of Time Warner's conduct as
described in paragraphs 1 through 65 hereinabove, Time
Warner breached the parties' agreement.

            98.  As a result of Time Warner's breach of the
agreement to carry the Fox News Channel, Fox News has
suffered an injury that is not compensable by money
damages.

            99.  Fox News contracted for and was assured
repeatedly that it would receive access to the Time Warner
cable television operating systems.

            100. Accordingly, Fox News is entitled to
specific performance requiring Time Warner to honor its
agreement with Fox News.


COUNT VII
(PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AGAINST TIME WARNER INC. AND TIME
WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.)

            101. Fox News repeats and realleges the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 65 of this
Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

            102. After Time Warner and Fox News reached an
agreement pursuant to which Time Warner would carry the Fox
News Channel on its nationwide cable television systems,
Time Warner executives repeatedly promised Fox News that
Time Warner would sign an agreement containing the agreed
upon terms and would carry the Fox News Channel on its
cable television systems.

            103. Time Warner's representations were made by
several senior executives. Accordingly, Fox News reasonably
relied upon Time Warner's promise to sign the agreement and
carry the Fox News Channel on its cable television systems.

            104.  Fox News advised Time Warner that it
believed that carriage on Time Warner's cable television
systems was vital to the success of the launch of the Fox
News Channel.  Moreover, Time Warner, by virtue of its
leading role as both a cable television system operator and
cable television programmer, knew that obtaining widespread
distribution of a new programming service is crucial to
that service's success.  Accordingly, Time Warner knew that
Fox News would rely on Time Warner's promise to carry the
Fox News Channel on Time Warner's cable television systems.

            105. Fox News substantially and reasonably
relied to its detriment on Time Warner's promise to carry
the Fox News Channel on Time Warner's cable television
systems. By advising Fox News just three weeks prior to its
planned launch date for the Fox News Channel that it would
not perform its agreement and carry the Fox News Channel,
Time Warner has made it impossible for Fox News to achieve
the widespread distribution of the Fox News Channel in New
York City and in other areas that were important to Fox
News's launch strategy.  If Fox News knew that Time Warner
did not intend to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable
television systems, which are monopolies in every one of
their franchise areas, including those in New York City,
Fox News would have pursued more aggressively contracts
with other cable system operators to secure desired
distribution levels at the launch date.

            106. As a result of Time Warner's breach of its
promise to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable
television systems, Fox News has suffered an injury that is
not compensable by money damages.

            107. Accordingly, Fox News is entitled to
specific performance requiring Time Warner to honor its
promise to execute the agreement to carry the Fox News
Channel on its cable television systems.

             WHEREFORE, Fox News asks for the following
relief:

            A.   A prompt trial on the merits.

            B.   Expedited discovery.

            C.   A judgment that the proposed merger
violates federal and state antitrust laws.

            D.   A judgment that Time Warner, Turner
Broadcasting, and Ted Turner have violated federal and
state antitrust laws.

            E.   On Counts I through IV,  (1) an injunction
preventing the consummation of the proposed merger or, (2)
if the merger is finalized prior to relief, an injunction
causing divestiture by Time Warner of Turner, and (3) such
other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

            F.   On Counts I through IV, an award to Fox
News of relief including damages sustained in an amount to
be more precisely determined at trial, but of at least $250
million, to be trebled according to the law, plus interest,
reasonable attorneys' fees, and costs of suit, as provided
in Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 15
and 26, and in the Donnelly Antitrust Act, New York Gen.
Bus. Law Sec. 340(5).

            G.   A judgment against Time Warner ordering
specific performance of Time Warner's promise to carry the
Fox News Channel on its cable television systems.

            H.   On Counts V, VI and VII, a judgment
awarding to Fox News damages in an amount to be more
precisely determined at trial, but of at least $250
million.

            I.   On Count V, a judgment awarding to Fox
News punitive damages of at least one billion dollars.

GOVERNMENT

[Editor's Note: Seeking inclusion in the presidential debates,
the Perot campaign offers the following theory of the Commission
on Presidential Debates' interpretation of federal campaign
regulation:

"First, given the undisputed facts, it is clear that the
Commission on Presidential Debates ("CPD") has not followed the
requirement of 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.13 to apply only objective
criteria. Second, the regulation is, in any event, ultra vires.
Third, the regulation on its face and as applied is void for
vagueness and an impermissible delegation of standardless
discretion to a private actor, or the CPD is itself a state actor
and has violated the Constitution.]


IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

ROSS PEROT, PAT CHOATE, and
PEROT '96, INC.,

Plaintiffs,

vs.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION,
and the COMMISSION ON
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES,

Defendants.

Civ. No. 96-02196 (TFH)

PLAINTIFFS' MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS'
MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF


I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs seek this Court's assistance in vindicating
their legal right to a selection process for the 1996
presidential debates in which objective criteria are
lawfully applied and constitutional requirements are met.
In seeking to safeguard these rights, plaintiffs' intention
is not to prevent presidential debates from occurring;
rather. plaintiffs seek to ensure that debate selection
processes are fair and impartial so that when debates are
held they are consistent with the principles upon which our
democracy was founded. Adherence to these principles will
not make the debates unwieldy or uninteresting, as
defendants claim. In fact, if debate participants are
selected consistent with legal requirements, no more than
two additional presidential candidates would be added.

There is no doubt that this Court has subject matter
jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims under either 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 1331 or 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437g of the Federal Election
Campaign Act ("FECA"). The ultimate role of the federal
judiciary is to hear constitutional claims, and defendants
can make no persuasive arguments that this Court does not
have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' constitutional claims as
well as over the ancillary nonconstitutional claims. In
addition, the statutory grant under FECA confers
jurisdiction on this Court without exhaustion of
administrative remedies because plaintiffs' claims are
constitutional or purely legal, and the administrative
process is both unnecessary, for no factual investigation
is required and because it will prevent the vindication of
plaintiffs' rights.

With respect to plaintiffs' substantive claims, plaintiffs
have demonstrated that injunctive relief is appropriate on
three independent bases. First, given the undisputed facts,
it is clear that the Commission on Presidential Debates
("CPD") has not followed the requirement of 11 C.F.R. Sec.
110.13 to apply only objective criteria. Second, the
regulation is, in any event, ultra vires. Third, the
regulation on its face and as applied is void for vagueness
and an impermissible delegation of standardless discretion
to a private actor, or the CPD is itself a state actor and
has violated the Constitution. Without injunctive relief,
plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed, and the relief
requested by plaintiffs threatens no harm whatsoever to the
debates, but rather promises to enrich and broaden our
public discourse.


II. THIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THIS CASE

The Supreme Court as well as this Court have clearly stated
that exhaustion of administrative remedies, even if
statutorily mandated, cannot and should not be absolutely
required in every case. McKart v. United States, 395 U.S.
185 (1969); Dorn's Transp., Inc. v. I.A.M. Nat'l Pension
Funds, 578 F.2d 1222 (D.D.C. 1984), aff'd, 753 F.2d 166
(D.C. Cir. 1985). Courts have not hesitated to rule that
they have subject matter jurisdiction to provide relief to
litigants who have not exhausted administrative remedies
under the FECA, as well as the National Labor Relations Act
("NLRA") -- the statute from which the administrative
procedures of FECA were modeled -- and many other statutes
with elaborate administrative schemes to resolve disputes.
Dolbeare v. F.E.C., No. 81 Civ. 4468-CLB, slip op.
(S.D.N.Y. March 9, 1982) (attached hereto at Tab 1) (court
did not require exhaustion where plaintiff raised ultra
vires and constitutional claims regarding the FECA).
Indeed, federal courts have virtually uniformly held that
exhaustion is unnecessary when a colorable constitutional
claim is brought, particularly when the administrative
process can provide no effective remedy. See McCarthy v.
Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 148 (1992); Dorn's, 578 F.2d at
1226. In those instances, courts have also taken
jurisdiction over ancillary nonconstitutional claims.
Dolbeare, supra, at 16.

Defendants ask this Court to create a jurisdictional rule
clearly at odds with this precedent. The extreme theory
advanced by defendants here is that no federal court has
jurisdiction to redress egregious violations of election
laws, unless they first yield to the primary authority of
the Federal Election Commission ("FEC"). Even if the action
of the FEC or the CPD is blatantly unconstitutional and
unlawful, and regardless of how severe the impact on the
presidential election, defendants contend that no immediate
private right of action is available, but rather that any
possible jurisdiction under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437g(a)(8) must
follow at least a 120-day waiting period. In short,
defendants submit that the CPD can take any action it wants
with regard to the presidential and vice- presidential
debates -- no matter how contrary to the law and the public
interest -- and elude the nettlesome gaze of the federal
courts.1/

As demonstrated below, defendants' theory that there are no
exceptions to statutorily-mandated exhaustion for
administrative processes, such as that contained in the
FECA, is clearly wrong. This case is precisely of the type
in which federal courts have excused compliance with
administrative remedies because it involves constitutional
questions, and resort to the administrative process would
be futile because plaintiffs' rights cannot be vindicated
there. Moreover, agency expertise will not advance
resolution of the issues presented here. In addition, the
administrative processes contained in the FECA are not
designed to cover constitutional claims in which the
complaint is against the FEC itself or the CPD acting as a
government entity or in a public function, particularly
when a constitutional issue is raised. Finally, even if
jurisdiction is not conferred under the FECA, this Court
has jurisdiction over the constitutional claims and
ancillary nonconstitutional claims under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331.


A. Federal Courts Recognize Exceptions to
Statutorily-Mandated Exhaustion

The Supreme Court in numerous cases has established the
principle that statutorily-mandated exhaustion should not
always be required. The Supreme Court and lower federal
courts have long recognized that exceptions to the
exhaustion requirement exist when administrative remedies
are inadequate, and that these exceptions can extend to
cases involving statutes that set up a carefully crafted
administrative process that generally should be pursued
first.

In McKart, petitioner failed to appeal an administrative
decision by his draft board, and was faced with the
argument that his key defense to a criminal charge was
unavailable because he did not exhaust administrative
remedies, as provided by statute. The Court noted that
"[p]erhaps the most common application of the exhaustion
doctrine is in cases where the relevant statute provided
that certain administrative procedures shall be exclusive."
McKart, 395 U.S. at 193. It further noted that exhaustion
is required, among other reasons, when the rights of the
complaining party can be vindicated in the administrative
process.

Notwithstanding the statutory process for administrative
exhaustion and the formidable list of policies served by
exhaustion described in the opinion, the Court in McKart
excused petitioner from the exhaustion requirement and
reached the merits of his lawsuit. In part, to be sure,
this holding rested on the fact that the case was a
criminal one, but the Court also stressed that the issue
before it was "solely one of statutory interpretation" that
"does not require any particular expertise on the part of
the [selective service] appeal board ...." Id. at 197-98.
In that respect, this case was judged "different from many
Selective Service classification questions" that involve
the need for expertise of the agency. Id. at 198.

McKart is only one of the Supreme Court decisions
recognizing that in cases involving statutes setting up an
exclusive agency process justice would not be served by
hewing formalistically to a requirement of initial
administrative exhaustion. In Coit Indep. Joint Venture v.
Federal Savings & Loan Ins. Corp., 489 U.S. 561 (1989), a
federal savings and loan association's claims were
dismissed below on the theory that a statute granted the
FSLIC exclusive jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reversed.
Coit's exhaustion discussion starts with broad language
about how "exhaustion of administrative remedies is
required where Congress imposed an exhaustion requirement
by statute," citing cases also cited by defendants. Id. at
579; Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 766 (1975); Myers
v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938).
Yet, later in the opinion, Coit states the-
well-established, critical corollary proposition:
"[a]dministrative remedies that are inadequate need not be
exhausted." Coit,  489 U.S. at 587 (citing Greene v. United
States, 376 U.S. 149,163 (1964) and Smith v. Illinois Bell
Tel. Co., 270 U.S.587, 591-92 (1926)). In Coit, the Court
reached the judgment that exhaustion would not be required
because there was a "lack of a reasonable time limit in the
current administrative claims procedure" confronting the
savings and loan association. The Court observed:


First, it [the current administrative claims procedure]
allows FSLIC to delay the administrative processing of
claims indefinitely, denying a litigant its day in court,
while the statute of limitations runs.


Id.

In Mccarthy, 503 U.S.140 (1992), the district court
dismissed a federal prisoner's Bivenstype damage action for
failure to exhaust administrative procedures before the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons. These procedures were established
by agency regulation, and in that sense this case does not
precisely involve a statutorily-mandated agency process.
Nevertheless, it was plain that the agency expected
prisoners to bring their complaints about prison conditions
to the prison officials first, and only thereafter to the
court. Once again, the Supreme Court started its exhaustion
discussion with the broad language that "[w]here Congress
specifically mandates, exhaustion is required." Id. at 144
(citing Coit, 489 U.S. at 579 and Patsy v. Board of Regents
of Florida, 457 U.S. 496, 502 n.4 (1982)). But the Court
then proceeded to employ judicial discretion to assess
whether exhaustion should be required. After turning to
McKart's discussion of ,exhaustion policies, McCarthy
elaborated situations in which exhaustion requirements have
given way to the individual interests in judicial relief:
"[r]equiring resort to the administrative remedy may
occasion undue prejudice to subsequent assertions of a
court action. Such prejudice may result, for example, from
an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative
action." Id. at 146-47.

In Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467 (1986), the
Supreme Court again did not require exhaustion of
statutorily-required administrative remedies. In Bowen,
individuals who were denied social security disability
benefits, or whose benefits were terminated, brought a
class action. Even though certain class claimants had not
exhausted an elaborate statutory mechanism for
administrative decision-making prior to judicial review,
these claims were allowed to proceed without exhaustion of
the agency process. Relying heavily on Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U.S. 319 (1976), the Court reasoned that as long as a
claim for benefits was presented to the Secretary, the
administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary may not
be required to be exhausted "where a claimant's interest in
having a particular issue resolved promptly is so great
that deference to the agency's judgment is inappropriate."
Bowen, 476 U.S. at 483 (citing Mathews, 424 U.S. at 330).
As in Mathews, the Court also notes that exhaustion was
unnecessary when the constitutional challenge is "entirely
collateral" to the substantive claim under the
administrative scheme and the plaintiff stands to suffer
irreparable harm if forced to exhaust his administrative
remedies. In short, the Supreme Court has established that
statutorily-based exhaustion requirements are not absolute
and that principled exceptions exist and should be applied
in appropriate circumstances.

This Supreme Court precedent has been followed under the
FECA as well as other federal statutes with similar
statutorily-mandate administrative processes. In Dolbeare,
plaintiffs challenged certain actions of the FEC as ultra
vires and unconstitutional, and defendant sought to dismiss
the action. Because plaintiffs had not exhausted
administrative remedies, defendant argued that the court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. The
court did not require exhaustion, stating:


Plaintiffs, however, have no administrative remedy for
these claims. They must wait, and suffer in silence, until
the FEC eventually decides that it has completed its
investigation, and makes a "probable cause" finding, if its
does. Until that time, plaintiffs and their contributors
can be subjected to endless discovery and delay by the FEC,
without being able to determine the scope or facts of the
FEC's investigation. Since there is no appropriate
administrative remedy, there can be no claim that
exhaustion is required.


Dolbeare, supra, at 18. See NCPAC v. F.E.C., 626 F.2d 953
(D.C. Cir. 1980).

The reasoning in Dolbeare tracks that of the Supreme Court
in Leedom v. Kyme, 358 U.S. 184 (1958), which interprets
the exhaustion requirements of the NLRA. As explained by
the Court in In Re Carter-Mondale Reelection Comm., Inc. v.
F.E.C., 642 F.2d 538, 545 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the
exclusive jurisdiction provision in the FECA was modeled on
that of the NLRA. The Court in Leedom upheld the original
district court jurisdiction without requiring exhaustion of
the administrative review provisions of the NLRA, because
the claim in that case was that the Board had acted in
excess of its power. See also Elm City Broadcasting Corp.
v. N.L.R.B., 123 F. Supp. 838 (D. Conn 1954).2/


B. The Exceptions To The Exhaustion Doctrine Apply In This
Case

This case is precisely of the type in which exhaustion of
administrative remedies is not required.3/ First, because
the case involves serious constitutional claims, exhaustion
of administrative remedies is ordinarily not appropriate.
Second. requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies
would be futile as the FEC has taken the position it cannot
resolve plaintiffs' claims prior to the election, much less
prior to any debates. Third, resort to the agency is not
needed to resolve factual issues because the claims here
are purely legal. Fourth, the interests of the plaintiffs
in receiving prompt judicial attention outweigh other
institutional interests which might favor exhaustion.
Fifth, not requiring exhaustion in this unusual case will
not open a floodgate of election law litigation in the
federal courts.


1. Statutorily-mandated exhaustion is ordinarily not
required for constitutional claims.

As noted by the Supreme Court in Califano v. Sanders, 430
U.S. 99, 109 (1977), "when constitutional questions are in
issue, the availability of judicial review is presumed." As
a result, exhaustion of administrative remedies is
ordinarily not required when a constitutional claim is
brought. McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 148.

In Dorn's, 578 F. Supp. at 1222, this Court granted
judicial review of the constitutionality of a statutory
provision prior to the exhaustion of the mandated
administrative remedy of arbitration. The court noted that
where the "complaint poses a facial challenge to the
constitutionality of the Act, the purpose of exhaustion
doctrine would not be served by its application." Id. at
1226. The court noted that "purely constitutional questions
generally are thought beyond the ambit of administrative
proceeding." Id. at 1227; see Blitz, 538 F. Supp. at 1124
(citing Oestereich v. Selective Syc. Local  Bd., 393 U.S.
233 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring)). The court need not
decide that the constitutional claims are meritorious to
take jurisdiction over them. Rather, the court must accept
jurisdiction over the constitutional claims unless it is
immaterial and alleged solely as a means of obtaining
federal jurisdiction, or is wholly insubstantial and
frivolous. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 683 (1946).

Defendants rely upon Daly v. Costle, 661 F.2d 959, 963
(D.C. Cir. 1981) to argue that the administrative process
can provide plaintiffs with a remedy, and therefore
plaintiffs must exhaust their administrative remedies
before bringing their constitutional claims before this
Court. But Daly provides that allegations of constitutional
deprivation will only change exhaustion analysis "so long
as effective remediation" of plaintiffs problem could be
achieved in the administrative process. Id. As explained
below, since the administrative process cannot be concluded
until after the election, an administrative determination
after the election that Perot and Choate should have been
included in the debates would hardly provide an effective
remedy for them. Accordingly, there is no basis for
requiring an exhaustion of the administrative process for
plaintiffs' constitutional claims.

Once the Court has jurisdiction over the constitutional
questions raised by plaintiffs, it also acquires
jurisdiction over plaintiffs' other causes of action, even
though the Court would not independently have jurisdiction
over those other claims standing alone. See, Dolbeare,
supra at 16.

The existence of a constitutional claim has been cited as
grounds for jurisdiction, even where an "exclusive" remedy
was delegated to a governmental agency. In an action where
plaintiff sought to enjoin an election mandated by the
National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB") so that he
(plaintiff) would have an opportunity to participate in the
election, Chief Judge Learned Hand of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled:


The first question is as to the jurisdiction of the
District Court which the defendant disputes, invoking our
decision in Fitzgerald v. Douds. We there held that, since
the only review of a "certification" proceeding under Sec. 9
was an incident to a petition to review an order of the
Board under Sec. 10, the remedy created was exclusive;
although we recognized that the result might be otherwise,
if a constitutional question were raised. The plaintiff at
bar does raise such a question; .... If this assertion of
constitutional right is not transparently frivolous. it
gave the District Court jurisdiction: and. having once
acquired jurisdiction. the court might. and should. dispose
of all other questions which arose. even though they would
not have been independently justiciable.


Fay v. Douds, 172 F.2d 720, 723 (2d Cir. 1949) (emphasis
added) (citing Township of Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326
U.S. 620, 629 (1945)). The assertion of a constitutional
claim does not automatically create jurisdiction over all
other claims -- "[t]here must also be the necessity for
equitable relief." Elm City, 123 F. Supp. at 840.

In the present case, the necessity for equitable relief is
apparent -- if plaintiffs are required to exhaust their
administrative remedies prior to commencing their claims in
this Court, they will suffer irreparable harm. Accordingly,
it is proper for this Court, which clearly has jurisdiction
over plaintiffs' constitutional claims, also to consider
"all other questions which arose, even though they would
not have been independently justiciable." Fay, 172 F.2d at
723.


2. Exhaustion of administrative remedies would clearly be
futile in this case.

The debates are scheduled to commence shortly, and the
general election will occur on November 5, 1996, just 36
days from the date of this filing. In this instance, where
the two-party-controlled CPD excludes a third-party
candidate who secured 19 percent of the popular vote in
1992 and has qualified for $29 million in federal election
funds, the Court's mandate is to consider the very special
circumstances of this case in determining whether
plaintiffs must essentially forfeit their claims on the
altar of the exhaustion doctrine.4/ McCarthy, 503 U.S. at
147 ("Even where the administrative decision making
schedule is otherwise reasonable and definite, a particular
plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm if unable to secure
immediate judicial consideration of his claim."): Dorn's,
578 F. Supp. at 1226 ("[T]he exhaustion requirement must be
evaluated in light of the circumstances presented by each
case.").

When forced to exhaust administrative remedies, a litigant
ordinarily has his day in court delayed and suffers the
financial costs of pursuing an independent litigation track
before reaching the federal courts. Candidates Perot and
Choate, however, face the prospect of losing their claimed
right to participate in the debates entirely,5/ and
becoming holders of what the defendants derisively call
"generalized grievances," which they would then presumably
argue do not provide standing for plaintiffs to allege
them.

This "catch-22" of administrative procedure is not what the
exhaustion doctrine is designed to accomplish. While the
additional inconvenience and expense of fully pursuing an
administrative remedy would in no way provide sufficient
grounds to avoid exhaustion, an impending injury -- such as
the complete loss of adequate relief -- can necessitate
that relief be granted prior to the time that the harm can
be undone. As the Supreme Court has clearly established:
"[a]dministrative remedies that are inadequate need not be
exhausted." Coit, 489 U.S. at 587 (citations omitted).


3. Resort to agency processes is not needed to develop a
factual record as purely legal issues are presented here.

In some instances, the administrative record developed by
an agency proceeding is essential to a federal court being
able to adequately assess matters which are within the
everyday expertise of the agency. In this instance, though,
the facts are all undisputed and a matter of the public
record, and there appear to be no difficult or technical
issues that should lead the Court to feel ill-equipped to
handle this matter. Where the claims are purely legal, this
Court has previously held that the purpose of honoring the
exhaustion requirement -- avoidance of "premature
interference with the administrative process"-- would not
be served. Dorn's, 578 F. Supp. at 1226; Farquhar v.
F.D.A., 616 F. Supp. 190, 193 (D.D.C. 1985).


4. Plaintiffs' interest in prompt resolution outweighs the
interest of requiring agency review prior to court review

The present case presents a situation "where a claimant's
interest in having a particular issue resolved promptly is
so great that deference to the agency's judgment is
inappropriate." Bowen, 476 U.S. at 483. A prompt resolution
of this issue offers the only possible remedy for
plaintiffs. Delaying review (and resolution) of this issue
will only cause irreparable and serious injury, justifying
an exception to the exhaustion doctrine. Rafeedie v.
I.N.S., 880 F.2d 506, 518 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

In McCarthy, the Supreme Court counsels that the
determination of whether to relieve a litigant of her
exhaustion burden should be part of an "intensely
practical" balancing test between the interests of the
individual in receiving prompt judicial attention and the
countervailing institutional interests which favor
exhaustion. McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 146. The Court's
recognition that the importance or significance of
plaintiffs' need for a judicial hearing can outweigh the
efficiencies furnished by exhaustion are directly
applicable to the plight of Perot and Choate. The Court
held that:


Administrative remedies need not be pursued if the
litigant's interests in immediate judicial review outweigh
the government's interests in the efficiency or
administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is
designed to further.


McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 146 (citing West v. Bergland, 611
F.2d 710, 715 (8th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 821
( 1980)).6/ Given the irreparable harm to plaintiff of
requiring exhaustion and the fact that the FEC
administrative process cannot contribute to resolution of
this dispute, an exception to exhaustion requirements is
clearly warranted here.


5. Not requiring exhaustion will not open the floodgates of
election law litigation in the federal courts.

The exception to exhaustion that is being advanced in this
case is a narrow one, and allowing this case to proceed
without futile exhaustion of administrative remedies will
not, as the FEC suggests, open a floodgate of election law
litigation in the federal courts that would ordinarily
remain at the agency because of jurisdictional and
procedural requirements. FEC's Motion to Dismiss, at 8-9.
The plaintiffs' action is more than unique. involving the
highly-charged arena of presidential debates, and the
conduct of an entity acting under the regulatory direction
of the FEC itself. In particular, one must contrast this
case with the ordinary election law case in which one
private party sues another for arguable lack of compliance
with the election law. First, plaintiffs have sued the FEC
a public agency, for lack of compliance with governing
regulations, statutes and constitutional principles.
Second, although plaintiffs also sued the CPD, the focus of
those claims relates to the CPD's performance of a
governmental or public function. There is thus a sharp
distinction between this lawsuit and the garden variety
suit subject to administrative procedures between two
campaign organizations or when the FEC is enforcing the
Act. Moreover, the Supreme Court's McCarthy decision
expressly authorizes courts to consider the importance and
nature of a particular litigant's claim and the particular
administrative procedure provided. McCarthy, 503 U.S. at
146. There is no reason to believe that using this
balancing test to permit consideration of plaintiffs'
claims would necessarily mean that courts would be
duty-bound to ignore the exhaustion doctrine in all, or any
other, instance.


C. Statutorily-Mandated Exhaustion Is Not Required For
Plaintiffs' Claims Because There Is No Administrative
Remedy To Exhaust

In addition to the fact that this case fits within
virtually every recognized exception to exhaustion
requirements, plaintiffs further submit that actions
against the FEC and CPD of this type should not be subject
to administrative review. The purpose of the FEC
administrative process is to guide the FEC in enforcement
of the Act and to resolve disputes between private parties;
for instance, actions by one campaign organization
challenging another campaign organization for violating a
provision of the FECA. Congress did not contemplate that
constitutional challenges to actions of the FEC and CPD as
an actor performing a public or governmental function would
be subject to the FECA's administrative process.

Defendants cite several cases which appear to suggest that,
unless administrative remedies are exhausted, this Court
cannot exercise jurisdiction. What defendants fail to point
out is that those cases differ fundamentally from the case
before this Court. Those cases each involve a complaint
brought against a "person" covered by the administrative
procedures of FECA. The FEC and the CPD (an entity
operating under the FEC's regulatory direction) are not
"persons" under the FECA and thus there is no
administrative process to exhaust.

The elaborate enforcement scheme embodied in 2 U.S.C. Sec.
437g is applicable only to those complaints that allege
that a "person" has violated the statute. Section 437g(1)
requires the FEC to notify the person alleged to have
committed a violation, give the "person" 15 days to respond
in order to demonstrate that the FEC should not take action
against it, and Section 437g(4)(A)(i) requires the FEC to
attempt to correct any apparent violations through
conciliation before considering formal action. The statute
deliberately and explicitly excludes from the definition of
person the "Federal Government or any authority of the
Federal Government." 2 U.S.C. Sec. 431(11) That is because
the special statutory enforcement mechanism is not designed
to resolve complaints where the FEC itself, or any other
federal entity, is the target. To the extent that the
Complaint seeks relief against the FEC itself, or the CPD
in its capacity as a governmental surrogate, the provisions
of Sec. 437g should not be controlling.7/


D. Even if the FECA Does Not Confer Jurisdiction, This
Court Clearly Has Jurisdiction Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331

While plaintiffs submit that this Court clearly has
jurisdiction over its constitutional and nonconstitutional
claims under the FECA, subject matter jurisdiction over
plaintiffs' claims that the debate is ultra vires and
unconstitutional clearly and indisputably exists under 28
U.S.C. Sec. 1331. See Dolbeare, supra (finding precisely such
jurisdiction exists in precisely this type of case).
Dolbeare is directly on point.


Although a Congressionally created "statutory scheme" for
judicial review of the provisions of the statutes may
exist, as the FEC claims, under 2 U.S.C. Sections 437g and
h, and 26 U.S.C. Section 9041(a), this "scheme" does not
provide the sole means for challenging the statutes or the
actions of the FEC or its bureaucrats taken purportedly
pursuant to the statute but in effect alleged to be ultra
vires. The FEC's claims in this regard are without merit.


Id. at 6.

As in Dolbeare, plaintiffs here "have no administrative
remedies to exhaust to resolve the claims at issue herein."
Id. (citing Brown v. G.S.A., 425 U.S. 820 (1976) and
Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973)). Jurisdiction
over plaintiffs' claims that the debates regulation is
ultra vires and unconstitutional "is not committed
exclusively to the FEC," and "jurisdiction is not
specifically barred under sec. 1331." Id. (citation
omitted). The court must accept jurisdiction of such a
claim under Sec. 1331 unless (a) the constitutional claim is
immaterial and alleged solely as a means of obtaining
federal jurisdiction; or (b) the claim is wholly
insubstantial and frivolous. Id. (citing Bell, 327 U.S. at
683). Neither is the case here. As in Dolbeare, plaintiffs
"have no opportunity to enjoy an immediate adjudicatory
administrative forum in which to resolve the dispute and a
prompt resolution which will vindicate their rights...."
Since there is no appropriate administrative remedy, there
can be no claim that exhaustion is required. Even if an
administrative remedy existed, the exhaustion requirement
is displaced since plaintiffs' claims involve acts beyond
the scope of the FEC's delegated powers." Id at 10 (citing
Leedom, 358 U.S. at 184 and Fairchild, Arabatzis & Smith,
Inc. v. Sackheim, 451 F. Supp. 1181 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)).

Federal question jurisdiction of the district courts under
28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 is available unless the FECA precludes
judicial review or prescribes a particular form of action.
There is no indication anywhere in the FECA that Congress

III. PLAINTIFFS' PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION REQUEST SHOULD BE
GRANTED

A. Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated A Likelihood Of Success On
The Merits

1. The CPD's selection criteria plainly do not comply with
applicable FEC regulations.

The CPD's strained interpretation of the FEC's mandatory
criteria for candidate selection, and its contention that
it may turn to a host of "subjective" factors to help guide
its "objective" decision turns the use of language on its
head. While blithely stating that all of its selection
criteria are "objective within the ordinary meaning of that
term," CPD Memorandum, at 25, the CPD vainly attempts to
justify its use of subjective criteria to undertake an
"objective approach" in arriving at a fundamentally
subjective conclusion "whether a candidate has a realistic
chance of election." Id at 26.

That the CPD actually uses a mixture of objective and
subjective factors in order to determine whom to invite to
participate in its presidential and vice presidential
debates is without question. Indeed, in a televised press
conference on September 10, 1996, the co-chairmen of the
CPD openly conceded that this very mix of factors --
plainly prohibited by 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110.1 3(c) -- was at
work in the decision making process. "There are many
objective and subjective criteria," noted Co-Chairman Frank
J. Fahrenkopf, Jr. And, as Co-Chairman Paul J. Kirk noted,
"the subjective aspect is really studying what's been said
and what's been reported about." C-Span Presentation,
September 18, 1996, Transcript at 22-23 (a copy of which is
annexed hereto as Tab 2).9/

The CPD's assertion that "some subjective judgment on the
part of [the] evaluators" must be tolerated in the process
of making an objective determination is, indeed, the
exception that swallowed the rule. CPD Memorandum, at 25.
In fact, the CPD criteria allow for consideration of: the
opinions of Washington media bureau chiefs, political
campaign managers and pollsters, and political scientists;
the amount of newspaper front-page and network news
coverage afforded particular candidates; and the views of
"prominent political commentators." CPD Criteria, Numeral
2. That these subjective factors, specifically delineated
in writing by the CPD, are only the leading edge of the
iceberg was made clear in further media interviews given by
Co-Chairman Kirk.

Mr. Kirk was asked in a National Public Radio interview on
September 18, 1996 how to assess Perot's 1996 debate
exclusion in light of the fact that he was allowed entry in
1992:


That is a good question. It was the very same criteria ....

* * *

[Y]our question is why then and not now. In 1992 I think
the mood of the country was quite different. There was a
great -- I think more of an urgency for change than perhaps
we see now, greater fascination, if you will, with Ross
Perot who at that point was a new candidate on the scene.
The budget deficit issue was much more burning than it is
perhaps today even. Ross Perot basically had that as the
lead plank in his platform if you will. It was commanding
the kind of attention it deserved.

* * *

Now we come to 1996. It's the same candidate, but I think
a different feeling in the country about him, probably not
the same sort of attraction at least perceptively that he
might have had in 1992.

* * *

I think the committee felt that . . . it really would be
unrealistic to think that he could do better than he did in
1992, so they recommended that he not be invited to debate
in 1996.


Paul G. Kirk, Co-Chairman, CPD, September 18. 1996,
National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation, at 5-7
(emphasis added) (a copy of which is annexed hereto as Tab
3).[10/]

If, as it appears, the CPD is now in the business of
assessing the "mood" of the country. the public's
"fascination" with a particular candidate. and the relative
desirability of his positions as front-burner political
issues, the FEC's directives contained in 11 C.F.R. Sec.
110.13(c) are no longer even at issue. The CPD argues that
it must retain a "modicum of judgment in applying its
'objective criteria' so as to ensure the avoidance of a
potentially 'bizarre' or unwelcome result." CPD Memorandum,
at 25. Yet, the temperance and moderation described in the
CPD's pleadings does not resonate in the apparently
wide-ranging, subjective decision-making process which
excluded Perot and Choate from the 1996 debates.

The CPD's apparently wide-ranging and fast-mutating view of
what constitutes "objective criteria" for the purposes of
the debates understandably leaves it feeling that
plaintiffs in this proceeding have adopted "a cramped
construction of objective criteria." CPD Memorandum, at 23.
After all, the CPD notes, the term is not even defined
within the pertinent C.F.R. provision. Yet, the criteria
which the CPD adopted to guide its mandated "objective"
determination bare little resemblance to how federal courts
have defined "objective" data. Such information should be
"independent of what is personal or private in our
apprehension and feelings, that use facts without
distortion by personal feelings or prejudices and that are
publicly or intersubjectively observable or verifiable,
especially by scientific methods." Association of the Bar
of the City of New York v. I.R.S., 858 F.2d 876, 880 (2d
Cir. 1988) (citation omitted). The CPD's criteria, chock
full of opinions and views from various observers, and its
apparent references to the "mood" of the country and its
various "fascinations," simply cannot meet the standard
mandated by 11 CFR Sec. 110.13(c).[11/]

Further, the CPD's reliance on Wilson v. H.H.S., 770 F.2d
1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985) and DePauw v. I.T.C., 782 F.2d
1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 815 (1986)
is misplaced. The CPD argues that both Wilson and DePauw
stand for the proposition that "objective criteria," as
mentioned in statutes and regulations, can allow for
application of certain degrees of subjective judgment. That
may be true when, as in these two cases, a statutory
provision states that performance standards will "to the
maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of
job performance on the basis of objective criteria...." 5
U.S.C. Sec. 4302(b)(1) (emphasis added). Here, the FEC's
criteria for candidate selection do not explicitly provide
for the latitude which the CPD apparently wishes it had;
the regulation flatly states that "staging organizations
must use pre-established objective criteria to determine
which candidates may participate in a debate." 11 C.F.R. Sec.
110.13(c) (emphasis added). Nothing could be clearer.

Quite simply, while the CPD purports to make what it
considers "objective" determinations as to which candidates
will participate in the debates, it wants to be able to
gather and consider volumes of subjective data to inform
that decision. That process is incongruous, not permitted
by regulation, and has led to the inappropriate exclusion
of Perot and Choate from the 1996 debates.


2. Ultra Vires and Constitutional Arguments

a. Because FECA prevents corporations from funding
bipartisan debates, the regulation is ultra vires and the
CPD's scheduled debates are illegal.

The FECA categorically bans any and all corporate campaign
contributions and expenditures in presidential elections,
allowing for a few definitional exceptions. 2 U.S.C. Sec.
441(b). The purpose of this sweeping provision is to block
corporate control and manipulation of democratic elections
through direct campaign contributions or independent
expenditures.12/ The categorical ban on corporate money
dominance in elections is designed to combat the real and
symbolic fusion of political power with corporate power in
order to preserve public confidence in the integrity of our
democracy.

This ban thus arguably forbids corporate-funded debates
even if a corporation does invite all legally qualified
candidates to participate. After all, the evil targeted by
the statute is not just private corporations choosing to
boost one candidate over another, but private corporations
having any involvement at all with political candidates and
acting "in connection with" federal elections. Indeed,
corporate funding and staging of debates may be the most
insidious kind of corporate dominance of all because it
tends to be invisible and thus the public cannot determine
for itself what impact the corporations have had on the
framing of the candidate choices and substantive topics.13/

The structure of the statute furnishes a most compelling
argument for this interpretation. The only explicit
definitional exception FECA provides to the ban on
corporate involvement in federal elections is for internal
corporate communications and not for external action with
the public. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 431 (9)(B)(iii). It is quite a
leap from a corporation communicating with its
"stockholders, or executive or administrative personnel" to
communicating with all of the American people. Id

At the very least, FECA's ban on corporate dollars in
federal elections means that no corporation may spend money
on campaign election debates unless it invites every
legally qualified and electable candidate to participate.
On this theory, the purpose of the ban on corporate money
in elections is to prevent corporations from playing
favorites in campaigns and tilting elections in one
direction or the other. As a result, a corporation could
sponsor and fund a wide-open nonpartisan educational debate
and forum in which every single legally qualified candidate
was invited. As noted in Plaintiffs' moving brief, this was
the precise position taken by the FEC before it succumbed
to outside pressure and wrote its first debate regulation.

The FEC has thus ventured beyond its proper role and
written a regulation that is ultra vires.14/ Amazingly, it
now does not even bother to defend its regulation on the
basis of any actual language in the statute but instead
makes a series of irrelevant jurisdictional arguments, see
CPD Memorandum, at 12-14, that are clearly defeated by
Dolbeare, supra (finding federal jurisdiction to challenge
allegedly ultra vires and unconstitutional actions by the
FEC). It also rather gingerly invokes Chevron v. NRDC, 467
U.S. 837 (1984) to suggest that deference to the FEC's
"u-turn" is due here, see FEC's Memorandum, at 13. However.
an agency receives no deference at all when "the intent of
Congress is clear" and the agency is simply acting outside
of the terms of the statutory command. See Chevron, 467
U.S. at 842 ("If the intent of Congress is clear, that is
the end of the matter; for the court as well as the agency,
must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of
Congress."). Nor does focusing on the result -- as opposed
to the standard -- in Orloski v. FEC, 795 F.2d 156 (D.C.
Cir. 1986), do the FEC much good. See id. at 161 (standard
to be applied in reviewing FEC decision is whether it has
acted "contrary to law. under Sec. 437g(a)(8)(c)). An
administrative delegation is not a license to amend the
statute; and even if it were, it would violate the
separation of powers. Be that as it may, a legally
qualified and electable federal candidate has a right under
FECA to be invited to any corporate-funded debate, for if
he or she is not invited, the debate simply constitutes a
dressed-up campaign contribution to, or expenditure on
behalf of, his or her rivals.15/ See FECA, 2 U.S.C. Secs.
431(8)-(9).

The CPD at least makes a faint effort to argue that the
debate regulation falls under FECA's separate exemption for
"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to
vote or to register to vote ...." CPD's Memorandum, at 40
(citing 2 U.S.C. Sec. 431(9)(B)(ii)). This might work except
that this provision says nothing about debates, the debates
regulation says nothing about voting or voter registration,
and debate sponsors never register a single person to vote.
As legal reasoning goes, the argument offends a basic
principle of statutory construction -- Expressio unius est
exclusio alterius. ("The expression of one thing is the
exclusion of a different thing.")

The regulation must fail as ultra vires, which means that
CPD corporate expenditures -- and the contributions of
their large corporate donors -- amount to illegal campaign
contributions to the Democratic and Republican candidates
or illegal expenditures in connection with the election.
They must be enjoined, and the court cannot wait for the
FEC to do it because it is the FEC's own unlawful
regulation which created the violation.


b. The regulation is void for vagueness and violates due
process and the First Amendment by vesting standardless
discretion over presidential debates in private
corporations and the political parties that work with them.

(1) The regulation vests standardless discretion over
presidential debates in private corporations and the
political parties that work with them.

Even assuming the FEC had statutory authority to carve out
the exception at 11 C.F.R. Sec. 110. 13, its regulation
violates the First Amendment and is void for vagueness
because it delegates almost completely standardless
discretion over decisions affecting fundamental political
speech interests to private entities. See 60 Fed. Reg.
64,260, 64,262 (1995) (stating that the "choice of which
objective criteria to use is largely left to the discretion
of the staging organization," and that criteria may be
fixed "to control the number of candidates participating in
a debate if the staging organization believes there are too
many . . .").

One easy way to understand the First Amendment violation is
to hypothesize that the FEC had enacted the debate
regulation for itself, declaring that it was going to
sponsor debates and would select candidates to participate
using unspecified "objective criteria." Such an imprecise
standard would be void for vagueness since it would vest
"standardless" discretion in the FEC to run debates without
requiring it to provide specific "reasons, findings or
reasoned conclusions" as to its selection criteria, much
less why this or that candidate was included or excluded.
We could put it no better than the CPD itself, whose
astonishingly honest formulation captures perfectly the
nature of the regulations it operates under: "the
regulations do not define the phrase 'objective criteria'
at all. . ." CPD's Memorandum, at 23.

If it would be unconstitutional for the FEC to adopt this
empty standard for itself, it surely is much worse to
delegate it to a private actor, as in Larkin v. Grendel's
Den, 459 U.S. 116, 125 ( 1982) (striking down on First
Amendment grounds a state statute that allowed private
churches veto power over award of liquor licenses for
premises within 500-foot radius of their property). The FEC
has vested wide-open standardless discretion in the CPD to
determine which candidates will have the opportunity to
participate in presidential debates. The "objective
criteria" command is dangerously loose and can be employed
-- as it was in this case -- for explicitly political and
partisan goals. See id. at 125 (the veto power "could be
employed for explicitly religious goals" because the
statute "does not by its terms require that churches' power
be used in a religiously neutral way. "'[The] potential for
conflict inheres in the situation'; and appellants have not
suggested any 'effective means of guaranteeing' that the
delegated power 'will be used exclusively for secular,
neutral and nonideological purposes."') (citations
omitted). Just as the First Amendment establishes a
governmental "neutrality" principle as to religion, see
id., so does it establish a governmental "neutrality"
principle as to elections, where it takes on even greatest
force and urgency.16/

In this case, the vague "objective criteria" directive
fails to provide any real guarantee to candidates that the
power delegated to the CPD will be used for "neutral and
nonideological purposes."17/ Rather, their constitutional
rights are put at the mercy of a private corporation made
up of five Democrats and five Republicans and funded by
large corporations which may or may not have reason to
oppose particular candidates.

In this sense, plaintiffs' situation is closely analogous
to that of the plaintiffs in Lakewood v. Plain Dealer
Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750 ( 1988) (striking down as facially
invalid a city ordinance authorizing mayor to issue or deny
permits to newspaper publishers to place news racks on
public property and, if refused, requiring only that the
Mayor "state[d] the reasons for such denial"). The Court in
Lakewood held that the "danger" of "content and viewpoint
censorship" is "at its zenith when the determination of who
may speak and who may not is left to the unbridled decision
of a government official." Id. at 763. Without "standards
governing the exercise of discretion, a government official
may decide who may speak and who may not based upon the
content or viewpoint of the speaker." Id. at 763-64 Here,
the First Amendment danger is even worse since the
government officials have turned their decision over to
putatively private actors, against whom there is no
meaningful check against political discrimination at all.


(2) The regulation permits private corporations, like the
CPD, to - adopt an unconstitutional definition of
"electability."

In order to understand why the criteria applied against
plaintiffs were "non-neutral" and "ideological," see
Grendel's, 459 U.S. at 125, it is critical to see that
there are two potential definitions of "electability," the
word which now appears to be the pivotal concept in the
case. That is, there are two available meanings of
"electability"" that a corporate debate donor might employ
in developing criteria for debate inclusion: we propose to
call them the criterion of "legal electability" and the
criterion of "political electability," the former kind
perfectly consistent with -indeed warranted by -- the
Constitution, the latter kind wholly vague, discriminatory
and unconstitutional. Yet, the FEC has clearly invited
corporations to choose between these lawful and unlawful
alternatives. See 60 Fed. Meg. 64,260, 64,262 (1995)
(stating that the "choice of which objective criteria to
use is largely left to the discretion of the staging
organization," and that criteria may be fixed "to control
the number of candidates participating in a debate if the
staging organization believes there are too many," thus
plainly rejecting the constitutional approach); CPD's
Memorandum, at 26 (showing CPD's belief that FEC's debates
regulation authorizes its "nonpartisan, objective standard"
of "whether a candidate has a realistic chance at
election.")

The constitutionally permissible definition of
"electability" is whether a candidate is actually electable
as defined by the Constitution and federal law. Thus, the
following objective criteria are properly applied to
potential candidate debaters: (I) Is the candidate
constitutionally eligible to serve if elected? See U.S.
Const. art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 4 ("No person except a natural
born Citizen. . . shall be eligible the Office of
President; neither shall any person be eligible to that
Office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty
five Years . . ."); (2) Has the candidate qualified on
sufficient state ballots such that he or she could actually
collect a majority in the electoral college? See U.S.
Const. art. 11, Sec. 1, cl. 2; see also U.S. Const. amend.
XII;[18/] and (3) Has the candidate qualified for federal
funding for his or her campaign under the provisions of the
Presidential Campaign Fund Act?

These are the constitutionally acceptable criteria
corporate actors may use to select candidates to
participate in debates. The first two are absolute
objective prerequisites to the candidate taking and
assuming office and the third represents the closest that
FECA itself has to a definition of seriousness.19/

Clearly unconstitutional, however, is the creation of extra
constitutional and non-legislative criteria that focus on
the political "electability" of the candidate. There are
four decisive constitutional problems with this seductive
but deeply flawed version of electability.

First, as the Eighth Circuit pointed out in Forbes, this
notion of electability as "political viability" is "so
susceptible of variation in individual opinion" as to
"provide no secure basis for the exercise of governmental
power consistent with the First Amendment." Forbes v.
Arkansas Educ. Television Comm'n, 93 F.3d 497,504 (8th Cir.
1996). Indeed, few things are more unknowable than the
outcome of an election and few things so subjective and
arbitrary as guesses about it. At best, pollsters and
pundits take small snapshots of a political universe whose
history is marked by fluidity, comebacks, and stunning
upsets. One need only recall the famous photo of President
Truman brandishing the "Dewey Wins" headline to give pause
to the whole enterprise.

Second, it is fundamentally antidemocratic to use
predictions of election results to limit and restrict
political debate and thus alter the outcome of the
election. The Constitution delegates to Congress the job of
setting election day and it may set only one. See U.S.
Const. art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 3 ("The Congress may determine
the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which
they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same
throughout the United States."). It is per se impermissible
to replace this public election process with a private
selection process. See. e.g., Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S.461
(1953) (invalidating exclusionary political process set up
by private group of citizens to narrow the public's field
of choices). In American democracy, debate comes before the
voters' decision, not after. Indeed, political debate over
the public agenda and who shall preside over us is one of
the principal purposes of the First Amendment.20/

Third, even if we had a computer that could tell us with
absolute certainty who was going to win an election, it
would still violate the constitutional rights of other
candidates to exclude them from organized debates because
they were going to lose. Losers have First Amendment
rights, too, and may not be ejected from public debate
after having lost -- much less so before losing. The equal
rights of losers presumably prevent government from
enacting a law requiring all candidates trailing by more
than 30% in public opinion polls in presidential races to
return their federal funds or from passing a law denying
otherwise qualified candidates who are behind 30% in the
polls the right to invoke the equal-time provisions of FCC
law.

There is a critical reason why government cannot treat
future "winners" and future "losers" differently in this
way. The goal of "winning" the election, that is, capturing
the office, is often not the principal -- and is almost
never the exclusive -- reason for a candidate's running.
Candidates run for a myriad of other perfectly legitimate
reasons, including: (1 ) to inject messages and issues into
the campaign that would not otherwise be aired and that
other candidates might prefer to ignore;21/ (2) to improve
the quality of political debate and dialogue;22/ (3) to
establish legitimacy for a future run for office;23/ (4) to
begin to build the political infrastructure of a new party
to contest offices at a host of different levels; (5) to
influence the outcome of the election in a direction more
favorable to the candidate's supporters;24/ and (6) to be
offered the Vice-Presidency or a cabinet post at some later
point.25/ It would clearly violate the First Amendment to
prevent citizens from running for office if they had these
motives; there is no constitutional compulsion to run
exclusively to collect the most number of votes.

Fourth, by excluding legally electable candidates, the
standard of political electability ends up discriminating
on a viewpoint basis against candidates who represent
unpopular political views, interests or tendencies. It will
almost always be third parties who find themselves in
Perot's position -- that is, with a critical mass of
support but needing broader social exposure to grow and
institutionalize. Had he not debated in 1992, Perot would
never have won 19% of the vote. See David Firestone,
Perot's Impressive Loss, Newsday, Nov. 4, 1992, at 29
(noting that Perot's impressive debate performance buoyed
his campaign). If he does not qualify to debate, having
obtained ballot access in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, and securing nearly $30 million dollars in
federal funds, what third party candidate ever will? How
will the Reform Party qualify for federal funds next
election if it fails to meet the 5% threshold this
election? See Affidavit of C. Mulford, Para. 9. attached
hereto at Tab 4. It takes time, over the course of several
elections, to build up a new party, especially given the
tough requirements for obtaining ballot access and
qualifying for federal campaign funds.26/


(3) This case shows how. as applied. the FEC's vague
regulation and delegation of standardless discretion to
private actors will burden First Amendment rights.

This case provides a textbook illustration of how
discriminatory and unconstitutional results will follow
from the FEC's decision to allow corporate debate sponsors
to adopt the seductive definition of "objective" as
"politically electable." The CPD almost got the criteria
for legal electability right--it began by focusing on the
eligibility requirements of Article II, Section I and
whether a candidate has a mathematical chance of winning in
the electoral college -- but then tacked on a host of
criteria that allow it, and its various delegates and
interviewees, to descend into almost comic arbitrariness
and partisan discrimination. See CPD Candidate Selection
Criteria for 1996 General Election Debate Participation.

For example, seeking "signs of national newsworthiness and
competitiveness," the CPD purportedly solicited the
"professional opinions of the Washington bureau chiefs of
major newspapers, news magazines, and broadcast networks."
Even assuming this took place,27/ it seems hard to
understand why the participation of a constitutionally
eligible candidate on the ballot in fifty states who just
received nearly $30 million in federal funds should rest on
the reactions over the telephone of a small group of
Washington bureau chiefs. Why are their views more legally
significant than those of any other group of American
citizens?

The CPD Criteria also require it to seek out the opinions
of "professional campaign managers and pollsters not then
employed by the candidates under consideration" Amazingly,
this "factor" does not even require that these consultants
and pollsters have no conflict of interest in terms of
other campaigns they may be working on. For example, a
consultant who is approached by the CPD might be working on
a House or Senate campaign whose outcome could be affected
by the presence or absence of a large group of Independent
or third party voters at the polls. If such a consultant
wants to depress turnout by Independents, he or she could
simply tell the CPD interviewer, for example, that Perot
should not be included in the debates because he has no
realistic chance to win.

The Criteria also have the CPD examining the "[c]olumn
inches on newspaper front pages and exposure on network
telecasts in comparison with the major party candidates."
This is a blatantly discriminatory "factor" that again
delegates an important public decision to the media. How
can a candidate who is not yet an elected official compete
on these terms against the President of the United States
and the Senate Majority Leader?

The Criteria also allow the CPD to rely on "findings of
significant public opinion polls conducted by national
polling and news organizations." Even if it were
constitutional to give legal effect to polls (could a state
conduct a poll instead of an election to fill a public
office?), we would have every reason to doubt their
"objectivity" and utility. See Christopher Hitchens, Voting
in the Passive Voice in For the Sake of Argument, at 42-43,
50 (1993) (concluding that, since everything follows from
the formulation of the question, "polling is not a benign,
detached mapping of the political landscape but, rather, a
powerful means of cultivating and reshaping it," and
quoting former pollster Pat Caddell to the effect that
polling is "an instrument for deception whereby the truth
is obscured and the public will excluded and ignored.").
See also, Affidavit of G. Black, Paras. 17-20.

In sum, by allowing, even encouraging, corporations to
adopt the "politically electable" standard for debate
inclusion, the FEC regulation both defeats the purpose of
the statute and violates the First Amendment.


c. The CPD is a state actor.

The CPD disclaims its status as a state actor exercising
control over an integral part of the electoral process. It
emphasizes that it "is a private corporation with a
voluntary board of directors" and "receives no federal
funds." CPD's Memorandum, at 32. These features do not make
it less of a state actor than the Jaybird Association, a
private and self-funded unincorporated group deemed to be
a state actor because of its exclusion of disfavored
citizens from "an integral part" of "the elective process
that determines who shall rule and govern ...." Terry, 345
U.S. at 461. But, in its Memorandum, the CPD completely
bypasses the entire white-primary line of authority whose
contemporary relevance was just restated by the Supreme
Court in Morse v. Republican Party of Virginia, _U.S._, 116
S. Ct. 1186 (1996). It prefers to analogize its situation
to that of the U.S. Olympic Committee.

It is simply not true that "there can be no finding of
'governmental action' where, as here, the government has
exercised no control over the selection of participants in
CPD's debate." CPD's Memorandum, at 35. This assertion
disregards the whole teaching of the white-primary cases,
which is that state action in politics can take place when
"the government" formally exercises no legal power but
where individual state actors play a role in excluding
other citizens in the electoral process. Yet the CPD
quickly glosses over its very own constitution and
composition as a (bi)partisan agency with elected members
of the United States Senate and United States House of
Representatives serving as Commissioners.

No further discovery is needed in this case to establish
the relevance of Justice Frankfurter's rule that state
action exists when "somewhere, somehow, to some extent,
there be an infusion of conduct by officials, panoplied
with state power ...." Terry, 345 U.S. at 473. The
information we have been able to cull from public records
indicates that the CPD is not only a state actor because of
its well-documented subservience to the Democratic and
Republican Parties, but because it is composed
self-consciously of the two Democratic and Republican
co-chairs and four Democratic and four Republican
Commissioners, three of whom are presently sitting members
of the U.S. Congress, where they exercise federal
legislative power under Article I of the Constitution. The
following CPD Commissioners are currently members of
Congress:28/ Senator Paul Coverdell (R. Ga.);29/
Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich (R. Nev.);30/ and
Congressman John Lewis (D. Ga.).31/

Each of these three Commissioners took an oath of office
swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution, a
constitutional obligation they retained during their
service at meetings of the CPD. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl.3.
Moreover, by assuming a central role in the CPD's
deliberations, they not only established clear state action
in the CPD's control over debates but effectively created
a constitutional error analogous to the one made originally
in FECA and corrected in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,
109-143 (holding that FECA's provision for appointment of
FEC members by President pro tempore of Senate and House
Speaker violated appointments Clause); see also F.E.C. v.
NRA Victory Fund, 6 F.3d 821 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (stating that
it is well settled that Congress may not appoint members of
an agency with executive powers). If the CPD takes the
position that full and formal participation by three
elected members of Congress as CPD members does not
establish state action, then by extension all of the seats
on the Commission could be filled by members of Congress.
On the other hand, if the CPD agrees that filling the
Commission entirely with members of Congress would create
state action, then state action exists if even only one of
the Commissioner positions is filled by a member of
Congress. See id. (striking down the presence of even
non-voting members of the FEC appointed by Congress on the
grounds that it violated separation of powers because their
mere presence would influence the executive entity).

Given the fiercely partisan membership of the CPD and the
infusion of important elected officials throughout its
process, including selection of candidates for presidential
debates, it is hard to credit CPD's protestation that its
decision "was made independently, free from government
influence over the outcome, and without any governmental
authority." CPD's Memorandum, at 35. On the contrary, the
"Commission on Presidential Debates," which has everywhere
tried to be seen as official as possible, has gotten its
wish and must be treated as a formal part of the state
apparatus governing elections. Furthermore, the FEC and
Democratic and Republican Parties may not escape their own
complicity with this arrangement: they, too, have "elected
to place" their "power, property and prestige behind" this
unlawful discrimination. Burton v. Wilmington Parking
Authority. 365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961).


B. Plaintiffs Meet Other Requirements for Injunctive Relief

1. Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence
of the preliminary relief requested.

After violating statutory and constitutional law in
excluding Perot from the 1996 presidential debates, and
then contending that his challenge in this Court is
improperly lodged because he did not exhaust a
time-consuming and futile administrative process, the CPD
completes its circular argument by contending, in any
event, that Perot and his running mate will not suffer
"irreparable harm" if the requested relief is denied. The
CPD's argument is, quite simply, too cute to be clever.
Absent a preliminary injunction, the CPD will proceed to
use corporate funds unlawfully to stage presidential
debates that have been tailored to suit the specifications
of the two major parties and from which Perot has been
excluded by means of a process that blatantly violated FEC
regulations. Unless this Court intervenes, the debates will
occur as scheduled, without the participation of Perot or
Choate. Their rostrum at the debates cannot be recovered
once lost, and is in every sense the "imminent," "certain,
great, and actual, not theoretical," injury which the CPD
contends is absent. See Housing Study Group v. Kemp, 736 F.
Supp. 321, 330, opinion clarified on other grounds,
739F.Supp. 633 (D.D.C. 1990).32/ Examples of specific
injuries resulting to Plaintiffs are described in the
Affidavit of Clay Mulford, attached hereto at Tab 4.

The CPD improperly relies upon Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573 in
maintaining that candidates excluded from the debates lodge
merely a "generalized grievance," where the complaints are
no different in kind from what might be asserted by any
other citizen regarding the CPD's failure to follow its own
procedures. Yet, this so-called "standing the shoes of the
public" argument fails, for what Lujan truly means to
preclude are instances where a party seeks "relief that no
more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the
public at large." Id. Here, while including the Reform
Party's candidates in the debates would certainly benefit
the public's analysis of the upcoming elections, it is
Perot and Choate who would directly and tangibly benefit
from the relief requested herein.33/

Moreover, where it appears substantially likely to the
Court that a statutory or regulatory violation has
occurred, it may be presumed that an irreparable harm
sufficient to support injunctive relief is present. Gresham
v. Windrush Partners, Ltd., 730 F.2d 1417, 1423 (11th Cir.
1984); see also Reply Brief of Plaintiffs Hagelin,
Tompkins, and the Natural Law Party of the United States of
America at 23-25; United States v. Haves International
Corp., 415 F.2d 1038, 1045 (5th Cir. 1969) ("irreparable
injury should be presumed from the very fact that the
statute has been violated"); Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway Co. v. Lennen, 640 F.2d 255, 259 (10th Cir. 1981)
(same); Heublein. Inc. v. F.T.C., 539 F. Supp. 123, 128 (D.
Conn. 1982) ("When Federal statutes have been violated, it
has long been the rule that a court need not inquire into
the traditional requirements for equitable relief."); 7
Moore's Federal Practice, Moore's Federal Practice, Sec.
65.04(1) n. 7b. Presumption of harm also is warranted when
constitutional violations have occurred. Elrod v. Burns,
427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) ("loss of First Amendment
freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably
constitutes irreparable injury.").


2. Requiring The CPD To Apply Only Objective Criteria If It
Is To Sponsor A Presidential Debate is Clearly In The
Public Interest.

The CPD contends that granting a preliminary injunction to
plaintiffs would "be highly disruptive of the on-going
debate process" and would create a "very significant
potential" that President Clinton and Senator Dole would
"refuse to participate." The CPD further argues that the
public interest will be served by allowing the presidential
debates to go forward. CPD's Memorandum, at 44-46.

First, plaintiffs do not in any way seek the elimination of
debates altogether. Candidates Perot and Choate indeed see
the debates as being the most important vehicle in this
election year for allowing the electorate to make informed
balloting decisions as to whom they will support for
President and Vice President. Perot and Choate view the
debates to be in the "supreme" public interest. They also,
however, consider the public interest to be best served by
requiring that only lawful standards be used to determine
debate participation eligibility. To allow the debates to
proceed as presently constituted will not serve the public
interest in ensuring "fairness and integrity" in the
process at issue.

Furthermore, to suggest that this Court's intervention at
this late date will cause such disruption as to potentially
cancel the debates wholly ignores the circumstances of 1992
when Perot's participation in the debates was not confirmed
by the CPD until October 7, 1992, just four days prior to
the first debate on October 11, 1992.[34/] There is hardly
anything unduly "disruptive" about adding another chair to
the platform. The rapid and changing pace at which the
presidential debates are negotiated and scheduled is well
known. Requiring the application of lawful criteria to
debate participants can be accomplished quickly, with
minimal disruption, under the supervision of this Court.

Finally, for the CPD to suggest that the two major party
candidates might "refuse to participate" if others are
included in the debates flies in the very face of the
purpose of the subject regulation in the first place.35/
This case is not about a debate sponsor inviting only those
whom the two major political parties wish to be included.
It is about the application of lawful selection criteria,
applied fairly and equally to all concerned. For the CPD to
suggest that President Clinton and Senator Dole may refuse
to participate if this Court intervenes to protect the
integrity of this process is to ignore the very reason 11
C.F.R. Sec. 110.13(c) was promulgated. The public interest
will best be served by this Court's enforcement of this
regulation.


IV. REMEDY

Plaintiffs recognize that this Court should not
unnecessarily intrude into the election process, and does
not have authority to order that debates occur or select
the participants in those debates. This Court, however,
does have jurisdiction to guide the decision making process
of the CPD to ensure that it conforms to legal
requirements. Because the CPD has illegally provided for
the automatic inclusion of candidates of the two major
parties, and because the CPD must apply "preestablished"
criteria, plaintiffs suggest that this Court review the
criteria and inform defendants of the criteria it considers
objective. It is plaintiffs view that only three of the
criteria are objective: (1) the candidate satisfy
eligibility requirements of Article II, Section 1; (2) that
the candidate be placed on the ballot in enough states to
have a mathematical chance of obtaining an electoral
college majority; and (3) the candidate be eligible for
federal election funding. Because it cannot be disputed
that plaintiffs Ross Perot and Pat Choate meet these
requirements, plaintiffs suggest that the Court order the
CPD allow these candidates to participate in the debates.
At a minimum, the Court should identify the criteria set
forth above as the only "pre-established" objective
criteria, enjoin the CPD from applying any debate selection
criteria other than these pre-established objective
criteria in selecting participants for the debates; and
maintain continuing jurisdiction over this case and require
that the CPD provide this Court at least five days before
the staging of any debate with a written report of its
determination of eligibility for debate participation under
the permissible pre-established objective criteria. Because
the CPD is composed solely of members of the Democratic and
Republican parties, it is inherently biased and this Court
must maintain jurisdiction over the selection process to
ensure that an impartial, nonpartisan decision is made,
consistent with regulatory requirements.

In the alternative, this Court should declare the FEC's
debate regulation to be ultra vires and unconstitutional
and enjoin any further CPD or corporate spending on these
presidential debates or "in connection with" the
presidential election unless and until all legally
qualified candidates, according to Qualification for
Federal Campaign Funding and appropriate constitutional
criteria, are invited to appear at the October 6th, October
9th and October 16, 1996 debates.


V. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs respectfully urge
that this Court grant the injunctive relief they seek.

ATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFFS

ENDNOTES

1/ For example, had the CPD applied to major party
candidates the same criteria it applied to others and
determined, through an examination of its objective and
subjective factors, that Senator Dole's campaign efforts,
his standing in the polls and his money supply rendered him
no "realistic chance" of winning the election, it could
exclude him from the debates, and instead hold a debate
between President Clinton and Jim Lehrer. If, as
defendants' claim, Congress' intent with respect to federal
elections is that the federal courts can have no role in
policing such emergent situations, Mr. Dole would watch the
debates on television with the rest of the electorate. It
can certainly be argued that this situation is fanciful
because the CPD would never take such a position -- after
all, its members are evenly split between the Republican
and Democratic parties. Yet, to someone not steeped in the
jurisprudence of the FEC's "exclusive jurisdiction," it
would seem just as perverse for the two parties to sit down
together and subjectively determine to exclude competition
from the debates safe in the knowledge that the only body
with oversight authority would do nothing until after the
election results were in.

2/  In numerous other decisions, federal courts have
recognized exceptions to exhaustion where a statute
mandates initial resort to an administrative process. A
number of these cases are collected and presented in a
table attached as an exhibit to the brief filed by
plaintiffs Hagelin, et al.

3/ Nor is this a case where the Court should feel bound to
defer to the FEC under notions of "primary jurisdiction,"
a discretionary doctrine whereby an issue within the
special competence of an agency may be referred to it for
more efficient disposition. Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258,
267 (1993). In this case, as noted elsewhere herein, the
Court is confronted with an array of legal issues. Referral
to an agency under "primary jurisdiction" does not cede a
court's jurisdiction, and is most appropriate where factual
determinations and analysis in areas of agency expertise
are required. Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 409
U.S. 289, 305 (1973); Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass'n
v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 68
(1970). This is not the case here.

4/  If plaintiffs are required to fully pursue the
administrative process in this instance, they will by
definition lose all of their claims because the general
election will have come and gone before any relief can be
fashioned. This situation presents the prospect of
litigants losing constitutional rights without receiving a
day in court, and it is well- settled that statutes should
be construed -- where possible -- so as to avoid such
serious issues of constitutionality.

5/  Defendants claim that the upholding of exhaustion
requirements in two FEC cases -- National Conservative Poll
Action Comm. v. F.E.C., 626 F.2d 953 (D.C. Cir. 1980)
("NCP") and Sierra Club v. F.E.C., 593 F. Supp. 166, 169
(D.D.C. 1984) -- counsel that this Court should do the
same. However, neither NCP (which involved debt retirement
issues) nor Sierra Club (which involved in-kind
contributions to federal candidates) present the type of
time-sensitive claims alleged here.

6/ Plaintiffs endorse, and include herein as if fully set
forth, plaintiffs Hagelin, et al.'s discussion and citation
of numerous instances where exhaustion procedures deemed to
be jurisdictional are nonetheless deemed waivable by
federal courts. Hagelin, et al.'s Reply Brief, at 17-18.
See. e.g., Walker v. Southern Ry. Co., 385 U.S. 196, 198
(1966); Information Resources v. United States, 950 F.2d
1122 (5th Cir. 1992).

7/ Carter-Mondale. 642 F.2d at 538, a case the defendants
claim supports their position, strongly suggests judicial
intervention in the instant case would be proper. In
Carter-Mondale, the court had under review the prototypical
complaint by one political campaign committee against
another. The court concluded that resolution of the
complaint rested in the exclusive jurisdiction of the FEC
until the FEC had acted. The court observed that vesting
exclusive, albeit temporary, jurisdiction in the FEC was
designed "not only to allow development of the record, but
also because the FEC's resolution of this matter may be
satisfactory to all concerned and thereby preclude the need
for any appellate consideration. Id. at 542. In contrast,
in the instant case. the controversy does not require
record development and the FEC is clearly unable to resolve
the controversy to Mr. Perot's satisfaction in the time
available. The Carter-Mondale court did not address the
issue of respective jurisdiction of the court and the FEC
in cases where the FEC was the subject of the complaint
rather than the dispute resolution tribunal of first
instance. Indeed, the court expressly declined to address
"the authority and duty of the FEC in other circumstances."
Id.

8/  The Supreme Court has made clear in numerous cases that
it disfavors statutory regimes that foreclose judicial
review, particularly of constitutional claims and has been
unwilling to construe statutory provisions to preclude
court examination of constitutional claims. See. e.g.,
Johnson v. Robinson, 415 U.S. 361 ( 1974) (court entertains
claims under the First and Fifth Amendments despite
statutory language that forecloses court review of decision
by the Veteran's Administration "on any question of law or
fact under any law administered by the Veterans
Administration providing benefits for veterans and their
dependents or survivors"); Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592
(1988) (Court construes National Security Act of 1947 to
preclude judicial review except for "colorable
constitutional claims").

9/ Plaintiffs endorse, as if fully included herein. the
thorough discussion of subjectiveness on the part of the
CPD which set forth in Hagelin, et al.'s Reply Brief, at
10-15.

10/ CPD Co-Chairman Kirk's comments run counter to the
CPD's position in its brief -- that the CPD does "not rely
on the 'personal' or private"feelings of its members." CPD
Memorandum, at 25.

11/ The CPD apparently believes that by assuring the Court
that its criteria do not reply on the "personal" or
"private" "feelings" of its members, there should be no
concern over their use. To the contrary, the CPD plainly
gathers exactly these type of opinions, views and
impressions from various media and political figures to
inform its judgments. Thus, it wishes to usher in through
the back door what it is not permitted to bring through the
front. This, the Court should not permit.

12/ See Pipefitters Local Union No. 562 v. United States,
407 U.S. 385, 416 (1972) (purpose of Sec. 441(b) is to
"eliminate the effect of aggregated wealth on federal
elections"); United States v. Int'l Union United
Automobile. Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of
America, 352 U.S. 567, 585 (1957) (purpose of Sec. 441(b) to
restrict the political influence of "those who exercise
control over large aggregations of capital"); FEC v.
National Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 207 (1982)
(purpose of Sec. 441(b) to control the "substantial
aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages
which go with the corporate form of organization"); F.E.C.
v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life. Inc., 479 U.S.238, 239
(1986) (legislative history "makes clear that Congress has
long regarded it as insufficient merely to restrict
payments made directly to candidates or campaign
organizations.").

13/ For example, according to the Institute for Policy
Studies, several of the CPD's major corporate contributors,
including Phillip Morris, Upjohn and Dow Chemical are also
members of USA*NAFTA, the business lobbying consortium that
promoted congressional approval of NAFTA in 1993. In that
year, Mr. Perot and Ralph Nader were the two leading public
opponents of NAFTA and both of them have been excluded from
the debates this year by the CPD. Unfortunately, there is
no way of knowing whether there is any connection between
these events which supports the more categorical reading of
the statute. See Press Release by Institute for Policy
Studies, Sept. 26, 1996. According to news reports, the
CPD's sponsorship of presidential debates in 1992 also
featured dramatic breaches of the statutory wall between
corporations and electoral democracy. See Jonathon Groner
and Sheila Kaplan, Buying Smoke and Mirrors at the Debates,
American Lawyer, Nov.2, 1992 (describing how the "two main
donors," the Philip Morris Cos. and Prudential Insurance
Company, gave $250,000 each and Philip Morris, the world's
leading cigarette manufacturer, not only sponsored debate
receptions but was allowed to hang a "large banner" with
its name on it that was "visible during post-debate
interviews" on television, all of which prompted a CPD
spokeswoman who asked not to be named to remark, "We are
very grateful to them.")

14/ The FEC even slips up momentarily and confirms this
point in the course of denying the Plaintiffs'
constitutional claim: "the Commission has no governmental
power over presidential debates to delegate," FEC
Memorandum, at 15, which is precisely Plaintiffs' argument
about why the regulation is ultra vires. Otherwise deft in
walking the tightrope between asserting a statutory basis
for its regulation over debates but denying that it has any
regulatory power over debates to share. the FEC here falls
off the high wire. It is hard to see where its authority to
regulate presidential debates comes from if it "has no
governmental power over" them, and it cites no authority
for the brazen, if subtly stated, proposition that it has
the power to amend the statute's painstaking definition of
what kinds of corporate expenditures and contributions are
illegal. See id.

15/ Contrary to the FEC's argument on standing, see FEC
Memorandum, at 12, plaintiffs clearly have standing to
challenge the FEC's regulation since the ban on corporate
manipulation of elections is meant to liberate candidates
from the unequal intervention of corporate wealth in
political campaigns and they are clearly injured by effects
directly traceable to the FEC's lawless regulation. There
is clear redressability. simply by declaring the regulation
invalid. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555
(1992).

16/ The First Amendment requires that government legislate
"generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that
protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral
process itself," Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788
n.9 (1983), and are designed to make elections "fair and
honest." Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724,730(1974). Without
neutral election rules, we cannot maintain democratic
self-government through a meaningful and robust marketplace
of ideas and views--if we cut off the "extremes" of debate,
then we have no debate at all. Thus, the Constitution
compels government to remain absolutely neutral as between
political actors. See. e.g., First Nat'l Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978) (striking down ban on
corporate campaign expenditures relating to speech that did
not affect the "material interests" of the corporation);
Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 94 (1965)(striking down
ban on voting by military personnel stationed in Texas and
holding that "'fencing out' from the franchise a sector of
the population because of the way they may vote is
constitutionally impermissible."); Davis v. Bandemer, 478
U.S. 109, 139 (stating that government may not stack
political process to benefit a political party to such
extent that one party has "essentially been shut out of the
political process"); Miller v. Johnson, _ U.S. . 115 S. Ct.
2475 (1995) (striking down congressional districts drawn in
a process where the principle of racial neutrality is
disregarded); Anderson. 460 U.S. 480 (1983) (striking down
early filing deadlines that rigged system against minor
parties). The principle requiring official neutrality
pervades constitutional law. See. e.g., Romer v. Evans,
__U.S.__, No. 94-1039, 1996 WL 262293 (May 20, 1996)
(striking down state constitutional amendment attempting to
exclude homosexuals from political process). This is why it
is disappointing, if not surprising, that Defendant CPD
tries to torture out of the case law permission to
consecrate the Democratic and Republican Parties. See CPD
Memorandum, at 30 n.28. Fortunately, the FECA provisions
cited by CPD, and upheld by the Court in Buckley,
distinguish between "major" and "minor" parties and do not
overtly discriminate on behalf of the Democrats and
Republicans, the way the CPD does. See id.

17/ The prohibition on automatic debate inclusion on the
basis of political party is legitimate and mirrors the
constitutional command. However, by allowing corporate
debate sponsors to take political party into account at all
-that is, as one factor in a candidate's favor -- the
regulation runs afoul of the ban on viewpoint-specific
regulation in the political field. There must be objective
criteria applied equally as to all candidates. If political
party could ever be a "plus" factor for a candidate, then
theoretically a minor party candidate otherwise equal in
every respect to a major party candidate could be excluded
while the major party would be included. Such a result
would be aggressively offensive to the First Amendment. See
supra note 18. If the response is that the "political
party" factor could never operate as a "plus" factor, then
the regulation's language allowing it to be weighed so long
as it is not the "sole" factor is simply meaningless and
surplusage.

18/ Arguably this criterion itself is constitutionally
vulnerable since, under the arcane procedures of the
Twelfth Amendment, a presidential candidate who finished
second or third in the electoral college election could
theoretically capture the presidency by prevailing in a
contingent election in the House of Representatives. Such
elections in the House are few and far between -- the last
one was when Thomas Jefferson defeated Aaron Burr in 1800
after a tie in the electoral college.

19/ A candidate who satisfied the first two criteria but
not the third could make a plausible argument that the
Constitution will not tolerate any extra constitutional
criteria in the determination of debate participation, but
the thresholds for qualifying for federal funds have been
upheld already by the Supreme Court, Buckley v. Valeo, 424
U.S. 1, 109-143 (1976) and a legislative definition of
seriousness appears valid at this point. The link between
receiving statutory federal funds to run and debating is
widely accepted. See Senator Dole's remarks quoted in
Federal News Service, Federal Information Systems Corp.,
Sept. 29, 1992. ("A candidate refusing debate under
controlled circumstances should lose his claim on the money
of those he refuses to inform"); Senator Pryor's remarks
(American people "have come to expect debates and they
deserve debates. For those who give and check off that box
on the tax forms each year to the tax collector, we feel
that the least they should -- or that they do expect is a
debate by the candidates for president who receive this
money."). At any rate, this is a question that need not be
settled in the case of Messrs. Perot and Choate since they
have already qualified for federal funding under the
Presidential Campaign Fund Matching Act, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9001,
et seq., and have received nearly a $30 million payment
from the United States Treasury for the conduct of their
campaign.

20/ See. e.g., Thomas 1. Emerson, Toward a General Theory
of the first Amendment. 72 Yale L.l. 877, 883 (1963)
("Freedom of expression" is "indispensable to the operation
of a democratic form of government. Once one accepts the
premise of the Declaration of Independence -- that
governments derive "their just powers from the consent of
the governed" -- it follows that the governed must, in
order to exercise their rights of consent, have full
freedom of expression both in forming individual judgments
and in forming the common judgment."); Alexander
Meiklejohn, Free Speech and its Relation to Self-Government
(1948) (principle of free speech "is a deduction from the
basic American agreement that public issues shall be
decided by universal suffrage.").

21/ See. e.g., Citizen Perot. Newsweek, November 9. 1992,
at 23, 28 (before Perot reentered the 1992 campaign, "there
was little or no sign that George Bush and Bill Clinton
were prepared to discuss [the] primal issues" of deficit
reduction and generational equity, but deficit reduction
became a leading theme of the Clinton presidency); J. David
Gillespie, Politics at the Periphery, 27 (1993) (showing
how advocacy by losing Socialist Party candidates, like
Eugene V. Debs, of woman suffrage and a progressive income
tax in the early 1900s nonetheless led to the Sixteenth and
Nineteenth Amendments).

22/ See Eleanor Clift and Ginny Carroll, Perot: Pulling the
Race Out of the Mud. Newsweek, Oct. 26, 1992, at 34 (by
focusing attention on the deficit, "Perot . . . helped
elevate the last stage of a race that might otherwise have
been preoccupied entirely with mudslinging.").

23/ See. e.g., David Maraniss, After Latest Repudiation.
Clinton Hopes Past Is Prologue. Washington Post, November
27, 1994, A-1 (observing that Bill Clinton "emerged from"
his first electoral defeat in a congressional election
"with a can't-miss label as the next golden boy of Arkansas
Democratic politics"); Harold Holzer, The Lincoln-Douglas
Debates 24 (1993) (discussing Abraham Lincoln's
unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in Illinois in 1858 and
his participation in the famous debates with Douglas,
noting the "stubborn historical suspicion that Lincoln
shrewdly used the debates mainly to position himself for
the presidency two years later.").

24/ See Gillespie, supra at 108-09 (explaining how George
Wallace in 1968 was able to deny a popular vote majority to
either Richard Nixon or Hubert Humphrey, sending a national
message).

25/ See. e.g., Dan Balz Democrats Prepared to Contest
Election in All Areas of Country, July 10, 1992 (by
choosing Albert Gore as running mate in 1992, Clinton
picked "someone who ran for president in 1988, and who
experienced some of the intensity, scrutiny, and hardball
tactics of a national campaign," and thus "minimized the
danger of an embarrassment from his running mate"); Laying
the Groundwork, Orlando Sentinel Tribune, Dec. 25, 1992
(explaining selection of Bruce Babbitt, who ran for
president in 1988, as Secretary of Interior as logical
since he rose "from the grass-roots").

26/ The bitter chill cast on third parties by use of the
standard of political electability cuts against the grain
of our constitutional values. As Chief Justice Warren
remarked. "All political ideas cannot and should not be
channeled into the programs of our two major parties.
History has amply proved the virtue of political activity
by minority, dissident groups, who innumerable times have
been in the vanguard of democratic thought and whose
programs were ultimately accepted. Mere unorthodoxy or
dissent from the prevailing mores is not to be condemned."
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 251 (1957).

27/ Plaintiffs have been unable to locate any bureau chiefs
who were actually contacted.  See Declarations of Al Ortiz
(CBS Bureau Chief never contacted); R.W. Apple (New York
Times Bureau Chief never contacted); Jim Toedtman (Newsday
Bureau chief never contacted); Peter Beinart (Managing
Editor of New Republic never contacted).

28/ Other CPD members are former elected officials. Kay Orr
is the former Republican Governor of Nebraska. John
Danforth, a distinguished former Republican Senator from
Missouri, is known as a strong Republican partisan. The
other three Commissioners, while not holding office, are
also intimately involved with Democratic or Republican
Party politics -- Antonia Hernandez, President of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and
Democratic Party activist; Newton Minow, a lawyer and
former aide to Adlai Stevenson, has been active in
Democratic politics four decades; and Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg is the daughter of former President John F.
Kennedy and President of the John F. Kennedy Library
Foundation.

29/ Senator Coverdell has had a distinguished career in
Republican Party politics. See generally The Almanac of
American Politics 349(1996).

30/ Vucanovich has been a member of the House 1982. In
1994, Vucanovich was chosen by her Republican colleagues to
be the Secretary of the Republican Conference. See
generally The Almanac of American Politics 825 (1996).

31/ Lewis is a famed veteran of the civil rights movement
and a fierce Democratic Party stalwart. See generally The
Almanac of American Politics 368(1996).

32/ The CPD's suggestion that this Court's determination in
Fulani v. Brady, 729 F. Supp. 158, 162 (D.D.C. 1990),
aff'd, 935 F.2d 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1991), is controlling
misses the mark. Fulani. the CPD states, found it
impossible to  say whether a third-party candidate would
suffer injury by missing out on increased political stature
and media attention because it was "doubtful" that major
party candidates would deign to participate in such an
event. The argument is plainly inapposite to plaintiffs, as
Perot participated in the 1992 debates at the agreement of
the major parties, and received a substantial polling bump
as a result of the appearance. See Affidavit of R. Vemey,
Para. 15; Affidavit of G. Black, Paras. 12, 14 and 15.
Furthermore, the Circuit Court found in Fulani that the
plaintiff had alleged "injury in fact," and based its
standing denial solely upon the conclusion that the relief
sought would not redress the injury. 935 F.2d at 1328-29.
As pointed out in plaintiffs' moving brief (p. 23), the
Court's ruling against standing in Fulani is irrelevant to
the instant action, since the plaintiffs here are doing
exactly what the Court suggested that Fulani do in 1988,
i.e. to address the FEC's debate regulation. Id at 1329.

33/ The CPD's assertion that excluding debate participants
is a "process" injury is misguided. The gist of the
argument is that Perot and Choate's injury derives merely
from the fact that the CPD has failed to properly follow
its selection procedures, and has thus injured the public.
What Lujan counsels is that plaintiffs be "among the
injured," Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (quoting Sierra Club v.
Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972)) and have a "personal
stake in the outcome." Id. (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons,
461 U.S.95, 101 -02 (1983). The imminent exclusion of Perot
and Choate from the debates is no "conjectural" or
"hypothetical" injury. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 101-02.

34/ See Verified Complaint. Para. 17.

35/ The CPD falsely states that certain of plaintiffs'
arguments "would rule out debates in 1966 that include the
major party candidates." CPD Memorandum, at 45. The truth
is, the Dole and Clinton campaigns are free to stage
debates any time they want, but at their expense. Not only
are self-supported debates lawful under the FECA, the FCC
has ruled that the broadcasting of candidate-paid-for
debates is exempt from the equal opportunities requirements
of the Communication's Act of 1934. See. e.g.,  WCVB-TV, 2
FCC Rcd 4778 (M.M. Burl 1987) (New Hampshire Democratic
Party debates sponsored and controlled by the two sole
participants, Governor Dukakis and Congressman Richard A.
Gephardt). In short, the CPD has no equities in its favor
to continue perpetrating a fraud on the American
electorate. Ordering it to comply with clear cut legal
standards is not cognizable prejudice, and if the major
party candidates want to debate by themselves, they can do
so without illegal campaign contributions paying the costs
and without an indirect subsidy from the Treasury based
upon the CPD's tax exempt status.

                      CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE OFFENSE
         Defendant was one of the two detectives originally
assigned to investigate the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman. He arrived at the crime scene located on Bundy
Drive in Brentwood in the early morning hours of June 12, 1994.
Upon arrival, Defendant began his investigation.
         Within an hour of his arrival, defendant was notified
two more senior detectives had been assigned responsibility for
the case.
         When the two senior detectives arrived, they requested
defendant accompany them to the house of the deceased
woman's husband. At this second location, Rockingham Drive,
defendant made several evidentiary discoveries which eventually
led to the arrest of O.J.Simpson the former husband of the
deceased woman.
         In July, 1994, defendant appeared as a witness for the
prosecution in the preliminary hearing of the homicide case
against Simpson.
         Defendant was called as a prosecution witness in the
homicide trial of People v. Simpson (Los Angeles Superior Court
No. BA 097211) in March, 1995. Defendant was cross-examined on
March 14 and 15, 1995. On March 15, 1995 defendant was asked
the following questions by the cross-examiner and gave the
following answers:
Q. "I will rephrase it. I want you to assume that
perhaps at sometime since 1985 or 6, you addressed
a member of the African American race as a nigger.
Is it possible that you have forgotten that act on
your part?"
A. "No, it is not possible."
Q. "Are you therefore saying that you have not used
that word in the past ten years, Detective
Fuhrman?"
A. "Yes, that is what I'm saying."
Q. "And you say under oath that you have not addressed
any black person as a nigger or spoken about black
people as niggers in the past ten years, Detective
Fuhrman."
A. "That's what I'm saying, sir."
Q. "So that anyone who comes to this court and quotes
you as using that word in dealing with African Americans
would be a liar, would they not, Detective Fuhrman?"
A. "Yes, they would."
Q. "All of them, correct."
A. "All of them."
(Source: People v. Simpson, Vol. 107, page 18899)
On September 5, 1995, Laura Hart McKinny testified. In
her testimony she laid the foundation for two tape recorded
excerpts which, in Defendant's own statements as recorded,
impeached defendant's denial of any use of the racial
epithet during the ten year period. She also testified that
defendant had used the epithet in non-recorded conversations
during the ten year time period.
Three other witnesses, Kathleen Bell, Natalie Singer
and Roderick Hodge, each testified to instances of
defendant's use of the racial epithet within the ten year
period.
On September 6, 1995, defendant was recalled to the
witness stand as a defense witness. Out of the presence of
the trial jury, defendant asserted his constitutional right
not to incriminate himself.
DEFENDANT'S STATEMENT
Through his attorney, defendant has stated he is entering
a People v. West plea because he believes it is in his best
interest to do so. Defendant deeply regrets the effect his
testimony has had on the general public, the Los Angeles
Police Department and its employees, and his family.
SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS
Violation of Penal Code section 118 is a felony punishable
by a term of two, three or four years in prison. A person
convicted of the offense is eligible for probation and may be
supervised out of state pursuant to the interstate compact.
Criteria Affecting Probation [Rule of Court 414]
(a) Crime related facts:
(1.) Seriousness as compared to other instances of
the same crime
While perjury is always a serious offense, it is
rare that a witness who has given testimony is
prosecuted for that perjury. When there is
prosecution, the usual case involves a situation in
which the witness has given false testimony about an
event related to the crime or provided a false alibi.
Here there is no evidence that defendant gave any
false testimony about his investigative efforts. The
false testimony related to personal use of a racial
epithet during a time period that pre-dated the
criminal investigation.
An argument can be made that this type of perjury
is less serious than giving false testimony about the
investigation.
(a)(2) No weapon was involved.
(a)(3) No individual victim was involved.
(a)(4) No injury was inflicted on any person.
(a)(5) There was no individual who suffered monetary loss.
(a)(6) Defendant was an active participant in the crime.
(a)(7) There are unique circumstances in the commission of the
       offense.
(a)(8) No criminal sophistication was demonstrated.
(a)(9) The defendant did take advantage of a
       position of trust and confidence in the
       commission of the offense.
(b) Defendant Related Facts
(b)(1) No prior criminal record.
(b)(2) Not applicable because defendant has never
       before been placed on parole or probation.
(b)(3) Defendant is willing to comply with the
       terms and conditions of probation.
(b)(4) Defendant is able to comply with the terms
       of probation.
(b)(5) Imprisonment would create financial hardship
       on the defendant's dependents. Because of
       his background as a police officer defendant
       would be at risk in prison. There is no
       evidence that defendant needs to be
       incarcerated to deter him from future
       similar criminal conduct.
(b)(6) Defendant's primary adult employment was as a
       peace officer. One result of this conviction is
       defendant is precluded from ever again being
       a peace officer in California. (Government
       Code, Section 1029.) The high profile that
       resulted from the events surrounding the
       crime as well as the news focus that the
       conviction will create will make it
       difficult for defendant to find employment
       at any professional level.
(b)(7) The remarks of defendant as reported by his
       counsel indicate remorse.
(b)(8) Defendant presents no danger to others.
It would appear that defendant is an appropriate
candidate for probation.
Circumstances In Aggravation [Rule of Court 421]
The factors which appear to be circumstances in
aggravation are:
Rule 421(a)(6): Defendant's perjury illegally
                interfered with the judicial process.
Rule 421 (a)(11): Defendant took advantage of a
                  position of trust.
Circumstances In Mitigation [Rule of Court 423]
The factors which appear to be circumstances in
mitigation are:
Rule 423(a)(6): There was no physical harm to any persons
                or property.
Rule 423 (b)(1): The defendant has no prior criminal
                 record.
Rule 423(b)(3): The defendant has voluntarily
                acknowledged wrong doing at an early
                stage of the criminal process.

1. In the early 1960s, Philip Morris, Inc., came up with perhaps the most famous advertising image ever created--the Marlboro Man. The portrait of a rugged, adventurous cowboy smoking a cigarette atop a horse against a scenic mountainous backdrop is used effectively to this day, making Marlboro the best selling cigarette in the world. But while the prominent image of the Marlboro Man lives on, David McLean, the actor who originally portrayed the Marlboro Man, has died of lung cancer. Cigarettes killed the Marlboro Man.<P>
2. By this action, Plaintiffs LILO MCLEAN, the wife of David McLean, and MARK HUTH, AKA MARK MCLEAN, the son of David McLean, seek damages for wrongful death and personal injuries to David McLean based on common law theories of fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, misrepresentation to consumers, breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranty.<P>
 JURISDICTION<P>
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and because Plaintiffs are a citizens of a different state than the Defendants.<P>
 VENUE<P>
4. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1391 and 1392. David McLean purchased and smoked cigarettes that were manufactured and sold by Defendants in the Eastern District of Texas. Additionally, Defendants advertised in this District, received substantial compensation and profits from the sales of cigarettes in this District, and made material omissions and misrepresentations and breached warranties in this District.<P>
PARTIES<P>
A. Plaintiffs<P>
5. Decedent David McLean was a resident of Los Angeles, California. Due to his addiction to nicotine, David McLean used and could not discontinue the use of cigarettes, which caused him to die of lung cancer in 1995.<P>
6. Plaintiff LILO MCLEAN is an individual residing in Los Angeles, California, and was the wife of David McLean for over forty years.<P>
7. Plaintiff MARK HUTH, AKA MARK MCLEAN, is the son of David McLean residing in Los Angeles, California.<P>

Defendant Tobacco Institute has since its incorporation in 1958, operated as the public relations and lobbying arm of the tobacco companies.<P>
17. Beginning as early as the 1950s, and continuing until the present day, Defendants, and each of them, entered into an agreement with the intentional and unlawful purpose and effect of restraining and suppressing the dissemination of information on the addictive effects of nicotine and the harmful effects of smoking; restraining and suppressing the research, development, production, and making of a safer cigarette. In furtherance of Defendants' conspiracy, Defendants lent encouragement, substantial assistance, and otherwise aided and abetted each other with respect to these wrongful acts, and the other wrongful acts set forth herein. As a result of the conspiracy, the Defendants are vicariously, and jointly and severally liable with respect to each of the actions described herein.<P>
18. At all times herein mentioned, Defendants, and each of them, were acting as an agent of each of the other named and unnamed Defendants, and at tall times herein mentioned were acting within the scope, purpose and authority of that agency and with the full knowledge, permission and consent of each of the other Defendants.<P>
19. Each Defendants is sued individually as a primary violator and as a co-conspirator, and the liability of each Defendants under each of the causes of action alleged herein arises from the fact that each Defendants entered into an agreement with the other Defendants and third parties to pursue, and knowingly pursued, the common course of conduct to commit or participate in the commission of all or part of the unlawful acts, tortious acts, plans, schemes, transactions, and artifices to defraud alleged herein, including but not limited to: the manipulation of nicotine content and the big-availability of nicotine in tobacco products and the misrepresentation, concealment and suppression of information regarding the addictive properties of nicotine, and falsely advertising, marketing and selling cigarettes as safe, non-addictive, and not containing levels of nicotine manipulated by Defendants to cause addiction.<P>
20. The liability of each Defendants arises from the fact that each committed and engaged in a conspiracy to accomplish the commission of all or part of the unlawful and tortious conduct alleged herein, and intentionally, knowingly, and with evil motive, intent to injure, ill will or fraud and without legal justification or excuse, engaged in the conduct herein alleged.<P>
21. At all pertinent times, Defendants acted through their duly authorized agents, servants, and employees who were then acting in the course and scope of their employment, and in furtherance of the business of said Defendants, with the knowledge, ratification and consent of their officers, directors and managing agents.<P>
22. Defendants listed above and their predecessors and successors in interest did business in the State of Texas and the Eastern District of Texas, made contracts to be performed in whole or in part in Texas, and manufactured, tested, sold, offered for sale, supplied or placed in the stream of commerce, or, in the course of business, materially participated with others in so doing, tobacco products which the Defendants knew to be dangerous and hazardous and which the Defendants knew would be substantially certain to cause injury to the general public. Defendants committed and continue to commit tortious and other unlawful acts in the State of Texas and in the Eastern District of Texas.<P>
23. The Defendants, and their predecessors and successors in interest, performed such acts as were intended to and did result in the sale and distribution of tobacco products in the State of Texas, and the consumption of tobacco products by David McLean and by citizens and residents of the State of Texas.<P>
24. The term "addictive", used in this Complain is synonymous and interchangeable with the term "dependence-producing." Both terms refer to the persistent and repetitive intake of psychoactive substances despite evidence of harm and a desire to quit. Some scientific organizations have replaced the term "addictive" with "dependence-producing" to shift the focus to dependent patters of behavior and away from the moral and social issues associated with addiction. Both terms are equally relevant for purposes of understanding the drug effects of nicotine.<P>
 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS<P>
A. David McLean's Use of Cigarettes<P>
25. David McLean began smoking cigarettes at the age of 12 and was almost immediately addicted to the nicotine in tobacco. Because of his addiction to nicotine, Mr. McLean continued smoking cigarettes until he died at age 73.<P>
26. Due to his addiction to nicotine, David McLean smoked cigarettes everyday. Although he tried to quit smoking numerous times, his addiction to nicotine prevented him from doing so.<P>
27. During the time he became addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, David McLean did not know the adverse health consequences of smoking. Until 1964, cigarette packages and advertisements contained no warning of the adverse health effects of tobacco. David McLean was led to believe that smoking cigarettes was not harmful to his health or addictive.<P>
28. During his long history of smoking, David McLean primarily smoked Marlboro and Chesterfield brand cigarettes.<P>
29. In the early 1960s, already a smoker for over twenty years, David McLean was hired to portray the Marlboro Man in television and print advertising. During the taping of the commercials, David McLean was obligated to smoke Marlboro cigarettes. The commercials were very carefully orchestrated, and David McLean was required to smoke up to five packs per take, in order the get the ashes to fall a certain way, the smoke to rise a certain way, and the hand to hold the cigarette in a certain way.<P>
30. Even after his portrayal of the Marlboro Man, David McLean continued to smoke Marlboro cigarettes, and he continued to receive boxes of Marlboro cigarettes as gifts.<P>
31. In approximately 1985, David McLean began to suffer from emphysema due to smoking.<P>
32. In approximately 1993, during a pre-operative check-up for back surgery, David McLean's doctors found a tumor in his right lung. After further review, David McLean was diagnosed with lung cancer. Later that year, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor and part of the lung.<P>
33. Initially, doctors believed that the tumor had been fully removed. But in 1995, doctors discovered that cancer was still present in his right lung. Later that year, doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain and his spine. Chemotherapy and other treatments administered to David McLean were unsuccessful.<P>
34. In October of 1995, due to cancer caused by long years of smoking cigarettes, David McLean died, leaving a widow and fatherless son.<P>
 B. The Industry Conspiracy On Smoking and Health: Deceiving the Public About Disease and Death<P>
35. Through a fraudulent course of conduct that has spanned decades, Defendants have manufactured, promoted, distributed, or sold tobacco products to millions of consumers, including David McLean, knowing, but denying and concealing, that their tobacco products contain a highly addictive drug, known as nicotine, and have, unbeknownst to the public, controlled and manipulated the amount and big-availability of nicotine in their tobacco products for the purpose and with the intent of creating and sustaining addiction.<P>
36. The Tobacco Companies reap enormous profits from their manufacture and sale of cigarettes to consumers throughout the United States, including the State of Texas. The Tobacco Companies' earnings for the last year alone exceeded six billion dollars. The Tobacco Companies, make, advertise and sell cigarettes despite their knowledge of the following facts: More than 10 million Americans have died as a result of smoking cigarettes; almost one death in every five is due to a smoking- related illness; the leading cause of preventable death in the United States today is smoking cigarettes; smoking causes cardiovascular disease and is responsible for approximately one third of all heart disease deaths; smoking causes almost all lung and throat cancer deaths; smoking causes various pulmonary diseases, including emphysema; smoking causes stillbirths and neonatal deaths among the babies of mothers who smoke; and cigarettes may contain any number of approximately 700 additives, including a number of toxic and dangerous chemicals.<P>
37. Despite the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence that smoking cigarettes and using smokeless tobacco pose serious health risks, and despite the gruesome statistical legacy left by the tobacco industry, approximately 50 million Americans continue to smoke cigarettes, including 3,000 new teenage smokers daily, and millions more continue to use smokeless tobacco because they are addicted to these products. More specifically, they are addicted to nicotine, the drug in tobacco that causes an addiction similar to that suffered by users of heroin and cocaine .<P>
38. Cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance and the use of cigarettes results in addiction to them. Nicotine causes compulsive use of cigarettes, despite knowledge that they are harmful, if not lethal; nicotine has a psychoactive (mood-altering) effect in the brain; and, nicotine invokes what is called "reinforcing behavior," causing continued use of the nicotine-containing products. Cigarette smokers suffer an inability to quit, notwithstanding a desire to do so, and those who do quit (or attempt to) endure withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, depression, lack of concentration, and anxiety.<P>
39. The addictive power of nicotine is further illustrated by these statistical facts: at least two-thirds of adults who smoke say they wish they could quit; 17 million Americans try to quit smoking each year, but fewer than 1 out of 10 succeed; for every smoker who quits, 9 try and fail; 8 out of 10 smokers say they wish they had never started smoking; among smokers who suffer heart attack, 38% resume smoking while they are still in the hospital; even when a smoker has his or her larynx removed, 40% try smoking again; 70% of young people ages 12 to 18 who smoke say they believe they are already dependent on cigarettes; and 40% of high school seniors who smoke regularly have tried to quit and failed. According to David A. Kessler, M.D., Commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration, "Once they have started regularly, most smokers are in effect deprived of the choice to stop smoking . . . . Seventeen million Americans try to quit smoking each year. But, more than 15 million are unable to exercise that choice because they cannot break their addiction to cigarettes."<P>
 C. Knowledge That Nicotine Causes Addiction<P>
40. The fact that nicotine delivered by tobacco products is highly addictive was carefully and comprehensibly documented in the 1988 Surgeon General's Report, "The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction." The major conclusions contained in this report are (a) "Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting;" (b) "Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction;" and (c) "The pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine." Likewise, in a 1988 report addressing the health effects of smokeless tobacco, the World Health Organization concluded: "[T]here is ample evidence that the blood nicotine levels of smokeless tobacco users were as high as or even higher than those found in many cigarette smokers. Its continued use, therefore, does cause addiction and dependence in humans."<P>
41. Nicotine is now recognized as an addictive substance by such major medical organizations as the Office of U.S. Surgeon General, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the American Public Health Association, and the Medical Research Counsel in the United Kingdom. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has called cigarette smoking the most common example of drug dependence in the United States.<P>
42. Despite the recent recognition of nicotine's addictive properties by these and other organizations, the Tobacco Companies and their distributors continue to misinform the general public. Although it now appears that the Tobacco Companies have known for decades, on the basis of their own long-concealed research and testing, that nicotine is addictive, they have denied, and have continued to deny, that nicotine is addictive. The Tobacco Companies' insistence and affirmative denial that nicotine is addictive, coupled with their pervasive advertising, promotional and public relations strategy, is designed to and has effectively nullified the public's meaningful appreciation of the nature and extent of nicotine dependence. Specifically, the Tobacco Companies, emphasis on smoking as a voluntary personal choice and its positive social benefits misleads the public, especially the impressionable young people, into thinking that smoking may be stopped as easily as started. Knowledge of addiction then may thus come too late, when the phenomenon of addiction prevents or complicates any "personal choice" to quit.<P>
 1. The Tobacco Companies' Understanding of Nicotine Addiction.<P>
43. The Defendants know of the difficulties smokers experience in quitting smoking and of the tendency of addicted individuals to focus on any rationalization to justify their continued smoking. The Defendants exploit this weakness and capitalize upon the known addictive mature of nicotine. Nicotine addiction guarantees a market for cigarettes. The addictive nature of the nicotine in cigarettes virtually eliminates personal choice in those who become addicted.<P>
44. By no later than the early 1960s, and perhaps as early as the 1940s, the Tobacco Companies were fully aware, based on their own scientific research, that nicotine was an addictive substance and that regular cigarette smoking results in nicotine dependence. For example, an internal Philip Morris report from 1971 describes the difficulties a smoker has in stopping smoking one they are addicted to nicotine. "Even after eight months, quitters were apt to report having neurotic symptoms, such as feeling depressed, being restless and tense, being ill-tempered, having a loss of energy, being apt to doze off, etc. They were further troubled by constipation and weight gains . . . ."<P>
45. An internal report written in 1973 by William J. Dunn, Jr., a senior scientist with Philip Morris, says the following:<P>
 The primary incentive to cigarette smoking is the intermediate salutatory effect of inhaled smoke upon body function . . . . As with eating and copulating, so it is with smoking. The physiological effects serve as the primary incentive: all other incentive are secondary . . . . Without nicotine, the argument goes, there would be no smoking. Some strong evidence can be marshaled to this argument:<P>
(1) No one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine.<P>
(2) Most of the physiological responses to inhaled smoke have been shown to be nicotine-related.<P>
 46. Another internal Philip Morris document, this one from 1981, acknowledges that:<P>
 Nicotine is a powerful pharmacological agent with multiple sites of action and may be the most important component of cigarette smoke. Nicotine and an understanding of its properties are important to the continued well being of our cigarette business since this "alkaloid has been cited often as the reason for smoking" and theories have been advanced for "nicotine titration" by the smoker. Nicotine is known to have effects on the central nervous system as influencing memory, learning, pain perception, response to stress, and level of arousal.<P>
 47. Additional documents are, likewise, replete with evidence of such knowledge:<P>
   a. In 1962, Sir Charles Ellis, scientific advisor to the board of directors of British American Tobacco Company ("BATCO"), Brown & Williamson's parent company, stated at a meeting of worldwide subsidiaries, that "smoking is a habit of addiction" and that "[n]icotine is not only a very fine drug, but the technique of administration by smoking has considerable psychological advantages ..." He subsequently described Brown Williamson as being "in the nicotine rather than the tobacco industry."<P>
   b. A research report from 1963 commissioned by Brown & Williamson states that when a chronic smoker is denied nicotine: "A body left in this unbalanced state craves from renewed drug intake in order to restore the physiological equilibrium. This unconscious desire explains the addiction of the individual to nicotine." No information from that research has ever been voluntarily disclosed to the public; in particular, it was not shared with the committee that was preparing the first Surgeon General report and hence was not reflected in that report.<P>
   c. Addison Yeaman, General Counsel at Brown & Williamson, summarized his view about nicotine in an internal memorandum also in 1963: "Moreover, nicotine is addictive. We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the release of stress mechanisms."<P>
   d. Internal reports prepared by Philip Morris in 1972 and the Philip Morris U.S.A. Research Center in March 1978 demonstrate Philip Morris' understanding of the role of nicotine in tobacco use: "We think that most smokers can be considered nicotine seekers, for the pharmacological effect of nicotine is one of the rewards that come from smoking. When the smoker quits, he forgoes his accustomed nicotine. The change is very noticeable, he misses the reward, and so he returns to smoking."<P>
   e. From 1940-1970, the American Tobacco Company conducted its own nicotine research, funding over 90 studies on the pharmacological and other effects of nicotine on the body. This research constitutes 80% of all biological studies funded by the company over this period. In 1969, the American Tobacco Company even test marketed a nicotine enriched cigarette in Seattle, Washington.<P>
   f. In a 1972 document entitled "RJR Confidential Research Planning Memorandum on the Nature of the Tobacco Business and the Crucial Role of Nicotine Therein," an R.J. Reynolds executive wrote: "In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized, and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry. Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects."<P>
48. The industry's recognition of the extent to which nicotine--and not tobacco--defines its product is illustrated in a 1972 Philip Morris report on a CTR conference, which states:<P>
   a. "As with eating and copulating, so it is with smoking. The physiological effect serves as the primary incentive, all other incentives are secondary. The majority of the conferees would go even further and accept the proposition that nicotine is the active constituent of cigarette smoke. Without nicotine, the argument goes, there would be no smoking."<P>
   b. "Why then is there not a market for nicotine per se, eaten, sucked, drunk, injected, inserted or inhaled as a pure aerosol? The answer, and I feel quite strongly about this, is that the cigarette is in fact among the most awe-inspiring examples of the ingenuity of man. Let me explain my conviction. The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package. The product is nicotine."<P>
   c. "Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine ... Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine."<P>
49. Documents from a BATCO study called Project Hippo, uncovered only in May 1994, show that as far back as 1961, this cigarette company was actively studying the physiological and pharmacological effects of nicotine. Project Hippo reports were circulated to other U.S. cigarette manufacturers and to TIRC, demonstrating that at least some of the industry's nicotine research was shared. BATCO sent the reports to officials at Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds, and circulated a copy to TIRC with a request that TIRC "consider whether it would help the U.S. industry for these reports to be passed on to the Surgeon General's Committee."<P>
50. Similarly, an RJR-MacDonald Marketing Summary Report from 1983 concluded that the primary reason people smoke "is probably the physiological satisfaction provided by the nicotine level of the product."<P>
51. To this day, the cigarette manufacturers have concealed from he public and public health officials their extensive knowledge of the addictive properties of nicotine and its critical role in smoking and continue to contend that nicotine is not addictive and that cigarettes are not harmful to health.<P>
52. As recently as December 1995, the Wall Street Journal reported on an internal Philip Morris draft document analyzing the competitive market for nicotine products for the years 1990-1992. The report describes the importance of nicotine: "Different people smoke for different reasons. But the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their bodies." It is a physiologically active, nitrogen-containing substance. Similar organic chemicals include quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine. While each of these substances can be used to affect human physiology, nicotine has a particularly broad range of influence. During the smoking act, nicotine is inhaled into the lungs in smoke, enters the bloodstream and travels to the brain in about eight to ten seconds."<P>
53. Recently disclosed handwritten notes dated 1965 from Ronald A. Tamol, who until 1993 was Philip Morris, Director of Research and Brand Development, refer to "minimum nicotine ... to keep the normal smoker hooked."<P>
54. The cigarette manufacturers have affirmatively misrepresented to consumers and to Congress the role of nicotine in tobacco use. Even today, Brown & Williamson, R.J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute continue to claim that nicotine is important in cigarettes for taste and "mouth-feel." However, tobacco industry patents specifically distinguish nicotine from flavorants and an R.J. Reynolds book on flavoring tobacco, while listing approximately a thousand flavorants, fails to include nicotine as a flavoring agent. The cigarette industry has actually concentrated on developing technologies to mask the acrid flavor of increased levels of nicotine in cigarettes.<P>
55. Patent filings by the Tobacco Companies further reveal their knowledge of the addictive quality of nicotine. In a 1971 patent filing, Philip Morris discusses maintaining the "nicotine content at a sufficiently high level to provide the desired physiological activity." Years of numerous patent filings by the Tobacco Companies underscore the industry's knowledge that nicotine is addictive.<P>
56. Despite their knowledge that cigarette smoking is as a result of nicotine, extremely addictive, the Tobacco Companies still continue to deny that smoking is addictive. Through their individual advertising and public relations campaigns, and collectively through the work of the Tobacco Institute, the Tobacco Companies have successfully promoted and sold cigarettes by concealing and misrepresenting their highly addictive nature. The Congressional Subcommittee on Health and Environment commenced a public hearing March 25, 1994, on the potential regulation of nicotine-containing products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In the wake of the March 5, 1994, Congressional Hearings, spokespeople for the Tobacco Institute and the Tobacco Companies have denied in nationwide television broadcasts and print publications that nicotine is addictive. On April 14, 1994, the chief executives of each of the Tobacco Companies testified under oath before Congress and told the general public that nicotine is not addictive. Following the appearance of the Tobacco Companies' executives before Congress, Philip Morris took out full-page newspaper advertisements that stated in part: "Philip Morris does not believe cigarette smoking is addictive."<P>
 2. The Waxman Hearings.<P>
57. On February 25, 1994, David A. Kessler, M.D., Commissioner of the FDA, sent a letter to Scott D. Bailin, Esq., Chairman of the Coalition on Smoking and Health, asserting: "Evidence brought to out attention is accumulating that suggests that cigarette manufacturers may intend that their products contain nicotine to satisfy an addiction on the part of some of their customers. The possible inference that cigarette vendors intend cigarettes to achieve drug effects in some smokers is based on mounting evidence we have received that: (1) the nicotine ingredient in cigarettes is a powerfully addictive agent and (2) cigarette vendors control the levels of nicotine that satisfy this addiction."<P>
58. In response to Kessler's letter, on March 15, 1994, in a letter to The New York Times, James W. Johnston, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of R.J. Reynolds, continued to assert that nicotine was not addictive. Johnston based his assertion upon the success rate of American adults who had quit smoking.<P>
59. On March 25, 1994, David Kessler testified before the Waxman Subcommittee that "the cigarette industry has attempted to frame the debate on smoking as the right of each American to choose. The question we must ask is whether smokers really have that choice." Dr. Kessler stated:<P>
   a. "Accumulating evidence suggests that cigarette manufacturers may intend this result--that they may be controlling the levels of nicotine in their products in a manner that creates and sustains an addiction in the vast majority of smokers."<P>
   b. "We have information strongly suggesting that the amount of nicotine in a cigarette is there by design."<P>
   c. "[T]he public thinks of cigarettes as simply blended tobacco rolled in paper. But they are much more than that. Some of today's cigarettes may, in fact, qualify as high technology nicotine delivery systems that deliver nicotine in precisely calculated quantities--quantities that are more than sufficient to create and to sustain addiction in the vast majority of individuals who smoke regularly."<P>
   d. "[T]he history of the tobacco industry is a story of how a product that may at one time have been a simple agricultural commodity appears to have become a nicotine delivery system."<P>
   e. "[T]he cigarette industry has developed enormously sophisticated methods for manipulating nicotine levels in cigarettes."<P>
   f. "In many cigarettes today, the amount of nicotine present is a result of choice, not chance. [S]ince the technology apparently exists to reduce nicotine in cigarettes to insignificant levels, why, one is led to ask, does the industry keep nicotine in cigarettes at all?"<P>
60. On June 21, 1994, Dr. Kessler told the Waxman Subcommittee that FDA investigators had discovered that Brown & Williamson had developed a high nicotine tobacco plant, which the company called Y-1. This discovery followed Brown & Williamson's flat denial to the FDA on May 2, 1994, that it had engaged in "any breeding of tobacco for high or low nicotine levels."<P>
61. When four FDA investigators visited the Brown & Williamson plant in Macon, Georgia on May 3, 1994, Brown & Williamson officials denies that the company was involved in breeding tobacco for specific nicotine levels.<P>
62. In fact, in a decade-long project, Brown & Williamson secretly developed a genetically engineered tobacco plant with a nicotine content more than twice the average found naturally in flue-cured tobacco. Brown & Williamson took out a Brazilian patent for the new plant, which was printed in Portuguese. Brown & Williamson and a Brazilian sister company, Souza Cruz Overseas, grew Y-1 in Brazil and shipped it to the United States where it was used in five Brown & Williamson cigarette brands, including three labelled "light." When the company's deception was uncovered, company officials stated that close to four million pounds of Y-1 were stored in company warehouses in the United States.<P>
63. As part of its cover-up, Brown & Williamson even went so far as to instruct the DNA Plant Technology Corporation of Oakland, California, California, which had developed Y-1 to tell FDA investigators that Y-1 had "never [been] commercialized." Only after the FDA discovered two United States Customs Service invoices indicating that "more than a million pounds' of Y-1 tobacco had been shipped to Brown & Williamson on September 21, 1992, did the company admit that it had developed the high-nicotine tobacco.<P>
64. The general public is only now beginning to learn about the measures taken by the Tobacco Industry to conceal the truth about nicotine. On March 31, 1994, Congressman Waxman released a copy of a previously secret Philip Morris funded research study substantiating the addictive nature of nicotine. Philip Morris scientists, upon conducting tests, found strong evidence that nicotine might be addicting, which suggested further testing should be done. The experiment used in this study - self administration by rats - is one of the primary tests used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and World Health Organization to determine whether a drug is addictive. The research was submitted in 1983 to the scientific journal Psychopharmacology and was accepted for publication. Prior to publication, the journal was notified by the scientist that the article was being withdrawn "due to factors beyond [his] control." The scientist subsequently left Philip Morris and in 1986 resubmitted a revised version of the article to the journal. After the article was accepted for publication again, the scientist was forced to withdraw it by Philip Morris.<P>
65. If the Tobacco Companies had disclosed their knowledge of the addictive nature of nicotine when they first acquired this knowledge then the public would have learned about the addictiveness of nicotine many years ago. As a result, the scientific and medical community would have had access to critical Tobacco Industry secrets on the subject which would have resulted in a more rapid popular determination and consensus on the subject. The Tobacco Industry concealed and continues to attempt to conceal the truth about nicotine in order to sustain the additions of existing cigarette smokers and to "hook" thousands of new smokers every day, so that the Tobacco Companies can continue to profit at the expense of the lives and health of the general public.<P>
66. Not only does the Tobacco Industry know and conceal that nicotine is an additive drug, the Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the Tobacco Companies intend that their products contain sufficient nicotine to satisfy additional on the part of smokers and therefore control the levels of nicotine in these products to create and sustain the addition. It is this scheme to deceive the general public that enables the Tobacco Companies to see its life-threatening products to tens of millions of Americans as their captive customers.<P>
 3. The Tobacco Companies Manipulate the Level of Nicotine in Cigarettes With the Intent and for the Purpose of Creating and Sustaining Addictions to their Products.<P>
67. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the Tobacco Companies control or manipulate, the levels of nicotine in cigarettes. The Tobacco Companies developed technology years ago to remove nicotine from tobacco and to control precisely the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. Nevertheless, the Tobacco Companies continues to manufacture, market and sell their products with levels that are sufficient to produce and sustain addition. Rather than remove nicotine from cigarettes and smokeless tobacco--and hence remove the addictive drug contained therein--the Tobacco Companies add nicotine to their cigarettes through a variety of methods to maintain levels of nicotine sufficient to make their cigarettes additive to consumers.<P>
68. The Tobacco Companies prepare a substantial portion of the contents of their cigarettes through what is called a "Reconstitution process." Prior to the 1940s the waste products from cigarettes--tobacco leaf scraps and stems, dried tobacco dust, adhesive reinforcing fiber, mineral ash modifiers, humectant, and some other inexpensive materials--were discarded. Thereafter the tobacco companies began to sue these previously unusable materials to make reconstituted tobacco. As part of the process, the Tobacco Companies removed ingredients from these materials at an early stage of the process and replaced some of the nicotine in later stages. The reconstitution process allows the Tobacco Companies to manufacture cigarettes at a lower costs by using less tobacco which is the most expensive part of the cigarette and by making up the difference in content with the reconstituted tobacco. By removing the nicotine and then carefully replacing as much nicotine as desired the Tobacco Companies are able to control the precise amount of nicotine in cigarettes.<P>
69. LT Industries, a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clarke Corporation specializes in the tobacco reconstitution process and, as LT says in helping tobacco companies "control" their nicotine. The LT reconstitution process in the most widely used in the world. An LT-advertisement, entitled "More Nicotine, Or Less," published in tobacco trade publications states:<P>
 Nicotine levels are becoming a growing concern to the designers of modern cigarettes, particularly those with lower "tar" deliveries. The Kimberly-Clarke tobacco reconstitution process, used by LT industries, permits adjustments of nicotine 3 to your exact requirements. These adjustments of nicotine to your exact requirements. These adjustments will not affect the other important properties of customized reconstituted tobacco produced at LT Industries: low tar delivery, high filling power, high yield, and the flexibility to convey organoleptic modifications. We can help you control your tobacco.<P>
In fact, the process described in the LT advertisement can raise the level of nicotine beyond that which is naturally found in tobacco materials. In 1985, a Tobacco Journal article describing the LT process states: "Those standard reconstituted Tobacco Products contained 0.7-1.0 nicotine. LT Industries offers the possibility of increasing the nicotine content of the final sheet to a maximum of 3.5% . . . A dramatic increase in tobacco taste and smoke is noted in the nicotine-fortified reconstituted tobacco."<P>
70. Without informing the general public the Tobacco Companies have long viewed cigarettes in terms of their nicotine delivery function. For example, Philip Morris' William L. Dunn, Jr., wrote in a 1973 internal memorandum:<P>
 Why then is there not a market for nicotine per use, to be eaten, sucked, drunk, injected, inserted or inhaled as a pure aerosol? The answer, and I feel quite strongly about this, is that the cigarette is in fact among the most awe-inspiring examples of the ingenuity of man . . . .<P>
The cigarette should be conceived not as a product, but as a package. The product is nicotine. The cigarette is but one of many package layers. There is the carton, which contains the pack, which contains the cigarette, which contains the smoke. The smoke is the final package. The smoker must rip off all of these packaged layers to get to that which he seeks, Think of the cigarette as a storage container for [a] day's supply of nicotine . . . Think of the cigarette as dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine . . . Think of a puff of smoke as the vehicle for nicotine . . . Smoke is beyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine and the cigarette the most optimized dispenser of smoke . . . .<P>
 Likewise, a 1981 Lorillard study indicates that "current research is directed toward increasing the nicotine levels while maintaining or marginally reducing the "tar" deliveries."<P>
71. Evidence of the Tobacco Industry's intent and ability to manipulate nicotine in cigarettes at a sufficiently high level to provide the "desired physiological activity", is found in years of Tobacco Company patent applications. Tobacco Company patents illustrate an intent and ability by the Tobacco Companies to control the amount of nicotine in cigarettes; to provide desired physiological effects; to increase nicotine content in cigarettes by adding nicotine to various parts of the cigarette; to manipulate nicotine levels in cigarettes; and to manipulate the rate at which the nicotine is delivered in the cigarettes. For example:<P>
    A. A 1966 Philip Morris patent application discusses an invention that "permits the release into tobacco smoke, in controlled amounts, of desirable flavorants, as well as the release, in controlled amounts and when desired, of nicotine into tobacco smoke.<P>
   B. A 1971 Philip Morris patent states:<P>
It has long been known in the Tobacco Industry that in order to provide a satisfactory smoke, it is desirable to maintain a nicotine content of Tobacco Products at a uniform level. However, it is difficult to accomplish this result since the nicotine content of tobacco varies widely, depending on the type of tobacco and the condition under which the tobacco was grown.<P>
Maintaining the nicotine content at a sufficiently high level to provide the desired physiological activity, taste, and odor which this material imparts to the smoke, without raising the nicotine content through an undesirably high legal can thus be seen to be a significant problem in the tobacco art. The addition of nicotine to tobacco in such a way that it remains inert and stable in the product, and yet is released in a controlled amount into the smoke aerosol when the tobacco is pyrolyzed, is a result which is greatly desirable.<P>
The present invention provides a solution to this longstanding problem and results in accurate control of the nicotine which is released in . tobacco smoke. By employing the nicotine- releasing agents in methods of the present invention, it is possible to incorporate exact amounts of nicotine into tobacco composition, which will remain constant over extended periods of time and which will ultimately yield a smoke containing a controlled amount of nicotine.<P>
   C. Another 1971 Philip Morris patent application discusses a design to increase the nicotine content in the smoke of the tobacco product by adding nicotine. One of the expressed objects of the invention was to "provide an agent for the treatment of tobacco smoke whereby nicotine is easily released under controlled amounts." The same Philip Morris application explains that the proposed invention "is particularly useful for the maintenance of the proper amount of nicotine in tobacco smoke," and notes that "previous efforts have been made to add nicotine to Tobacco Products when the nicotine level in the tobacco was undesirably low."<P>
   D. A 1980 Loews' Corporation patent application discusses a process that "enables the manipulation of the nicotine content of tobacco materials such as cut leaf and reconstituted leaf by removal of nicotine from a suitable nicotine tobacco source, or by the addition of nicotine to a low nicotine material."<P>
   E. A 1986 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company patent indicates that the Tobacco Companies can precisely manipulate the rate at which the nicotine is delivered in the cigarette: "It is a further object of this invention to provide a cigarette which delivers a larger amount of nicotine in the first few puffs of the cigarette than in the last few puffs."<P>
   F. A 1991 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company patent application states that "processed tobaccos can be manufactured under conditions suitable to provide products having various nicotine levels."<P>
 72. Information about the Tobacco Companies, manipulation of the nicotine level in cigarettes, with the intent and purpose of creating and sustaining addictions to their cigarettes has only recently come to the public's attention. An ABC television show, "Day One," broadcast an episode February 28, 1994, entitled "Smokescreen--Cigarette Companies and Nicotine Level," during which "Day One's investigators reported their findings that the Tobacco Companies have been carefully controlling the levels of nicotine in their products for years. "Day One's" investigators reported that, to verify that nicotine is being added to reconstituted tobacco in cigarettes, they went to the American Health Foundation which analyzed the reconstituted tobacco portion of several brands of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarettes. According to "Day One," the samples tested had up to 70% of the nicotine that would be found in regular tobacco.<P>
73. During the March 25, 1994, Congressional Hearings, FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler testified that accumulating evidence suggests that the Tobacco Companies "may be controlling smokers' choice by controlling the level of nicotine in their products in a manner that creates and sustains an addiction in the vast majority of smokers." Dr. Kessler went on to say that some of "today's cigarettes may, in fact, qualify as high technology nicotine delivery systems that deliver nicotine in precisely calculated quantities - quantities that are more than sufficient to cease and sustain an addiction in the vast majority of individuals who smoke regularly." During the March 25, 1994, hearing, Dr. Kessler and others presented evidenced of the Tobacco Companies' manipulation of nicotine levels, including reference to internal memoranda and more than 30 industry patents.<P>
74. Just as the Tobacco Companies deny that the nicotine contained in cigarettes is additive, through their individual advertising and public relations campaigns and collective through The Tobacco Institute, the Tobacco Companies have denied unequivocally that they are engaged in controlling the level of nicotine in cigarettes for the purpose of developing and sustaining addiction to their products. Since the "Day One" program broadcast by ABC and the March 24, 1994, Congressional Hearings, spokespeople for The Tobacco Institute and the Tobacco Companies have in nationwide television broadcasts and publications denied all the charges that the Tobacco Companies manipulate nicotine levels in cigarettes. During their appearance before Congress on April 14, 1994, the chief executives of each of the Tobacco Companies testified that their companies do not manipulate nicotine levels or otherwise add nicotine to their cigarettes to create or sustain addition to their products.<P>
75. The nicotine content of the raw tobacco is not the only variable manipulated by the cigarette manufacturers to deliver a pharmacologically active dose of nicotine to the smoker. Cigarettes are not simply cut tobacco rolled into a paper tube. Modern cigarettes as sold in California are painstakingly designed and manufactured to control nicotine delivery to the smoker.<P>
76. For example, cigarette manufacturers add several ammonia compounds during the manufacturing process which increase the delivery of nicotine and almost double the nicotine transfer efficiency of cigarettes.<P>
77. Brown & Williamson publicly denies that the use of ammonia in the processing of tobacco increases the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker. Nevertheless, the company's own internal documents revealed that it and its rivals use ammonia compounds to increase nicotine delivery. A 1991 Brown & Williamson confidential blending manual states: "Ammonia, when added tobacco blend, reacts with the indigenous nicotine salts and liberates free nicotine . . . . As the result of such change the ratio of extractable nicotine to bound nicotine in the smoke may be altered in favor of extractable nicotine. As we know, extractable nicotine contributes to impact in cigarette smoke and this is how ammonia can act as an impact booster." According to Brown & Williamson manual, all American cigarette manufacturers except Liggett use ammonia technology in their cigarettes.<P>
 D. Fraudulent Concealment.<P>
78. Defendants have fraudulently concealed the existence of the causes of action alleged below. The Plaintiffs and members of the general public have exercised due diligence to learn of their legal rights, and despite such diligence, failed to uncover the existence of the violations alleged below until very recently. Defendants affirmatively concealed the existence of the causes of action alleged below through the following actions, among others:<P>
   a. Testifying falsely under oath before the United States Congress.<P>
   b. Providing false explanations of customers and to governmental entities regarding the health hazards of tobacco and the addictive qualities of nicotine.<P>
   c. Conducting activities in furtherance of the conspiracy in secret, including clandestine meetings, using tobacco company attorneys to secure documents that might reveal the dangers of cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine, closing down research projects and moving research and information facilities outside the United States.<P>
   d. Requiring employees to keep secret all information about the dangers of cigarette smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine under threats of severe legal consequences.<P>
 E. Tolling Of Applicable Statutes Of Limitation.<P>
79. Any applicable statutes of limitation have been tolled by Defendants' affirmative and intentional acts of fraudulent concealment, suppression, and denial of the facts as alleged above. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that such acts of fraudulent concealment included intentionally covering up and refusing to disclose internal documents, suppressing and subverting medical and scientific research, and failing to disclose and suppressing information concerning the addictive properties of nicotine and Defendants' manipulation of the levels of nicotine in their Tobacco products to addict consumers. Through such acts of fraudulent concealment. Defendants have successfully concealed from the public the truth about the addictive nature of tobacco and their manipulation of nicotine levels in their Tobacco products, thereby tolling the running of any applicable statues of limitation. Plaintiffs and members of the general public could not reasonably have discovered the true facts until very recently the truth having been fraudulently and knowingly concealed by Defendants for years.<P>
80. In the alternative, Defendants are estopped from relying on any statutes of limitation because of their fraudulent concealment of the addictive nature of nicotine and their manipulation of nicotine levels and big-availability of nicotine in their Tobacco products. Defendants were under a duty to disclose their manipulation of nicotine levels and bio-availability of nicotine in their Tobacco products because this is nonpublic information over which Defendants had exclusive control because Defendants knew that this information was not available to Plaintiffs or the general public and because this information was crucial to the consuming public in making their purchasing decisions. As a result of this concealment, members of the general public were deprived of informed consent regarding their ingestion of an addictive drug and were deprived of any choice on which to make a risk/benefit assessment.<P>
81. Until shortly before the filing of the Complaint in this action, Plaintiffs, David McLean, and the general public had no knowledge that Defendants were engaged in the wrongdoing alleged herein. Because of the fraudulent and active concealment of the wrongdoing by Defendants, including deliberate efforts--which continue to this day, to give Plaintiffs, David McLean, and members of the general public the materially false impression that nicotine is not addictive and that Defendants are not manipulating the nicotine levels of their Tobacco products, Plaintiffs, David McLean, and members of the general public could not reasonably have discovered the wrongdoing at any time prior to this time. Defendants have attempted and are continuing their attempts to keep such internal information from reaching the public. Indeed Defendants still refuse to admit that nicotine is addictive and that they have manipulated the levels of nicotine in their Tobacco products.<P>
 DAMAGES<P>
82. This action is brought by LILO MCLEAN, the loving wife of David McLean, and MARK HUTH, the son of David McLean, pursuant to the Survival Statute of the State of Texas, Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Sec. 71.021, and the Texas Wrongful Death Act, Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Sec. 71.001, et seq., for all damages recoverable under those Acts. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to the following elements of damages, in the past and future, due to the unfortunate and unnecessary death of their husband and father:<P>
A. Pecuniary damages for the loss of care, maintenance, support, advise, counsel, and financial contribution and support that David McLean would have provided during his lifetime had he lived;<P>
B. The loss of affection, comfort, companionship, society, emotional support, love, and affection that David McLean would have provided his wife during his lifetime had he lived;<P>
C. Mental anguish and pain and suffering and in which all reasonable probability Plaintiffs will continue to suffer in the future as a result of the death of their husband and father, David McLean;<P>
D. The mental anguish and conscious pain and suffering endured by David McLean prior to his death;<P>
E. The reasonable funeral and burial expenses because of the death of David McLean; and<P>
F. Loss of inheritance.<P>
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION<P>
(Fraud and Deceit)<P>
83. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 82 of this complaint, as though fully set forth herein.<P>
84. At all times during the course of dealing between Defendants and David McLean, through advertising and representations in the mass media and by other communications, Defendants have falsely and fraudulently represented that nicotine is not addictive. Moreover, Defendants have continually stated that they do not manipulate nicotine levels in their Tobacco Products so as to addict consumers. Additionally, Defendants falsely and fraudulently represented to David McLean that their tobacco products were not harmful to the health of cigarette smokers.<P>
85. In representations to David McLean, Defendants uniformly omitted the following material: nicotine is addictive; Defendants manipulate nicotine levels in their tobacco products so as to addict consumers; and smoking cigarettes causes adverse health consequences.<P>
86. Defendants were under a duty to disclose to David McLean the addictive nature of nicotine, Defendants' manipulation of the nicotine levels in Defendants' cigarettes, Defendants' intention to addict David McLean, and the adverse health effects of cigarettes. Defendants had sole access to material facts concerning the addictive nature of nicotine, Defendants' manipulation of the nicotine levels in Defendants' cigarettes, Defendants' intention to addict David McLean, and the adverse health effects of cigarettes. Defendants know that, prior to David McLean's addiction to nicotine, David McLean could not reasonably have discovered the addictive nature of nicotine, Defendants' manipulation of the nicotine levels in Defendants' cigarettes, Defendants' intention to addict David McLean, and the adverse health effects of cigarettes. In addition, Defendants actively concealed the addictive nature of nicotine, Defendants' manipulation of the nicotine levels in Defendants' cigarettes, Defendants' intention to addict David McLean, and the adverse health effects of cigarettes.<P>
87. The representations were false when made and known by Defendants to be false or were made with reckless indifference to the truth of the statements. In fact, cigarettes were known to Defendants to be harmful, nicotine was known to Defendants to be addictive, the level of nicotine in Defendants' cigarettes was known to be manipulated by Defendants, and the intent to addict or maintain addiction of David McLean was know to-Defendants.<P>
88. These misrepresentations and omissions were made deliberately, willfully, and maliciously to mislead David McLean and other smokers into reliance and action thereon, and to cause David McLean to purchase Defendants' tobacco products.<P>
89. David McLean had no way to determine that the representations were false and misleading, and that they included material omissions, and David McLean reasonably relied on Defendants' representations.<P>
90. By reason of his reliance on Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions and his subsequent addiction, David McLean sustained personal injuries and died from lung cancer.<P>
91. Defendants knew or acted with reckless indifference to the fact that nicotine was addictive, Defendants manipulated the amount of nicotine levels in tobacco products, and Defendants intended to addict David McLean and other cigarette smokers but refrained from disclosing the facts to cigarette smokers, for the purpose of inducing them to purchase tobacco products, thus causing personal injury and death to David McLean and thus causing damages to Plaintiffs.<P>
92. In addition to either having actual knowledge or a reckless indifference to the true facts, the conduct of the Defendants amounted to a willful refusal to know or to learn.<P>
93. Defendants are liable for punitive damage for their reckless or wanton or willful disregard for the public's safety in the manipulation of nicotine, a toxic and hazardous substance, in their cigarettes and their concealment and denial of nicotine's addictive properties and the adverse health effects of smoking, all done to maximize sales and profit at the expense of the public's health and safety. Defendants' willful and wanton conduct constitutes malice, oppression, fraud, and a conscious indifference to the right and safety of others, and thereby warrants the imposition of punitive and exemplary damages against Defendants.<P>
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION<P>
(Negligent Misrepresentation)<P>
94. Plaintiffs reallege, as if fully set forth, each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above, and further allege.<P>
95. By reason of their knowledge and expertise regarding the addictive nature of nicotine, manipulation of the amount of nicotine in tobacco products, intent to addict, their research into the adverse health effects of their products, and by reason of their statements to consumes in advertisements and other communications, at all times relevant hereto, Defendants owed David McLean and the tobacco consuming public a duty of care which required, among other things, that Defendants be truthful and accurate in their representations concerning their tobacco products.<P>
96. Defendants breached their duty of care to David McLean by negligently making the material misreprenentations alleged herein, thus causing David McLean personal injuries and death.<P>
97. David McLean reasonably relied on Defendants' representations, when in fact those representations constituted negligent misrepresentations.<P>
98. Such reliance was not only foreseeable by Defendants but also intended by them, and such reliance was reasonable.<P>
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION<P>
(Misrepresentation to Consumers)<P>
99. Plaintiffs reallege, as if fully set forth, each and every factual allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 98 hereof, and further allege.<P>
100. Defendants have engaged in the business of selling cigarettes and other tobacco products to consumers in the United States and in Texas.<P>
101. Defendants' advertisements and promotional statements made material misrepresentations to the public, including representations that their products were not addictive, that they did not manipulate the nicotine levels in tobacco products, that they did not intend to addict Decedent and the cigarette consuming public, and that there were no adverse health effects arising from the use of their products.<P>
102. David McLean reasonably relied on Defendants' misrepresentations of material fact concerning the character and quality of Defendants' tobacco products.<P>
103. Such reliance was not only foreseeable by Defendants but also intended by them, and such reliance was reasonable.<P>
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION<P>
(Breach of Express Warranty)<P>
104. Plaintiffs reallege, as if fully set forth, each and every factual allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 103 hereof, and further allege.<P>
105. Defendants' advertisements and promotional statements contained broad claims amounting to a warranty that their products were not addictive, that they did not manipulate the nicotine levels in tobacco products, and they did not intend to addict David McLean and the cigarette consuming public, and that there were no adverse health effects arising from the use of their products.<P>
106. Defendants breached their warranties by offering for sale, and selling as non-addictive, tobacco products that were addictive and contained levels of nicotine manipulated to make them addicted.<P>
107. This breach of the express warranties has caused David McLean to become addicted to Defendants' tobacco products and to suffer adverse health effects arising from the use of the product, thus causing David McLean personal injuries and death.<P>
 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION<P>
(Breach of Implied Warranty)<P>
108. Plaintiffs reallege, as if fully set forth, each and every factual allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 107 hereof, and further allege.<P>
109. Defendants impliedly warranted that their tobacco products, which they designed, manufactured, marketed, and sold to David McLean, were merchantable and fit and safe for ordinary use.<P>
110. Defendants' tobacco products purchased and consumed by David McLean were addictive, unmerchantable, and unfit for use when sold, and subjected these persons to addiction and/or adverse health effects. Therefore, Defendants breached the implied warranty of merchantability at the time the tobacco products were sold to David McLean in that the tobacco products were not fit for their ordinary purposes.<P>
111. As a direct and proximate result of the breach of the implied warranty of merchantability by the Defendants, David McLean was addicted to Defendants' tobacco products and has suffered adverse health effects, including death, causing decedent and Plaintiffs to incur damages.<P>
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF<P>
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief and judgment against the Defendants, jointly and severally, as follows:<P>
1. for general damages according to proof;<P>
2. for all medical and incidental expenses according to proof;<P>
3. for punitive and exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to punish and deter others from similar wrongdoing;<P>
4. for funeral and burial costs;<P>
5. for costs of suit herein incurred;<P>
6. for pre-judgment interest as allowed by law; and<P>
7. for such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.<P>

<title>Counsel Connect Web - Leonard v. Pepsico</title>
<BODY bgcolor=ffffff text="000000" link="000080" vlink="ff0000">
<img width=100 height=92 align=left src="/images/spotlight/spt2.gif"> 
<blockquote>
<P>Editor's Note: A disappointed TV viewer sued Pepsico for failure to
provide the Harrier jet he thought he had won in the soft drink
company's "Pepsi Stuff" ad campaign. The TV commercials in the campaign
featured various apparel and leisure items that could be obtained in
exchange for Pepsi Points. Pepsi Points were obtained through purchasing
Pepsi products, or, if you read the fine print, could be purchased for
ten cents each. The close of one commercial showed a teenager arriving
at school in a Harrier Jet with a Pepsi logo on it and offered the jet
for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points. Mr. Leonard accumulated 15 actual Pepsi
Points and submitted them with a check for $700,008.50 to purchase the
balance of Pepsi Points he needed for the Harrier Jet (and $10.00 for
shipping and handling as per the contest rules). But, he received no
Harrier Jet. He resubmitted his Pepsi Stuff order twice more. Still no
jet. Mr. Leonard has turned to the courts to redress the damages he will
continue to suffer until his jet is delivered. His suits alleges
specific performance, breach of contract, fraud, deceptive and unfair
trade practices, and, finally, misleading advertising against the
Purchase, N.Y. soft drink company. Pepsi reportedly filed a suit in New
York to block Leonard's suit on the grounds that it is frivolous.</P>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<B><P>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ELEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR DADE
COUNTY, FLORIDA</P>

<P>GENERAL JURISDICTION DIVISION</P>

<P>CASE NO: 96-15647</P>

<P>JOHN D.R. LEONARD, Plaintiff</P>

<P>vs.</P>

<P>PEPSICO, INC., Defendant</P>


<P>COMPLAINT</P></B>

<P>Plaintiff, JOHN D.R. LEONARD, sues Defendant, PEPSICO, INC. and alleges
as follows:</P>

<P><B>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</B></P>

<P>1. This is an action for damages in excess of $15,000.00 exclusive of
interest, costs and attorney's fees.</P>

<P>2. Plaintiff, JOHN D.R. LEONARD ("LEONARD"), is a resident of Seattle,
Washington, and is otherwise sui juris.</P>

<P>3. Defendant, PEPSICO, INC. ("PEPSI"), is a North Carolina corporation
with its principal place of business in Purchase, New York at Anderson
Hill Road, Purchase, New York, 10577, and is doing business in the state
of Florida.</P>

<P><B>FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</B></P>

<P>4. PEPSI is a corporation primarily engaged in the business of producing
and distributing soft drinks world wide. To promote the sale of its
products here in the United States, PEPSI launched a national
advertising campaign utilizing various forms of media, the most
significant of which is the use of television commercials.</P>

<P>5. Specifically, this national advertising campaign, coined, "Pepsi
Stuff," consists of offering various merchandise, for sale, to the
general public in exchange for Pepsi Points. Pepsi Points are actually a
promotional item, much like phoney money, which entitle a participant to
receive prizes based upon the amount of points assigned to a particular
prize. Each prize offered in the Pepsi Stuff campaign can be obtained by
a participant simply by tendering his/her Pepsi Points to PEPSI.</P>

<P>6. Pepsi Points can be acquired in two ways. One method is to purchase
specifically marked packages of PEPSI products from vendors throughout
the country who sell PEPSI products. The second method is to purchase
points directly from PEPSI, via an order form, for 10 cents per point.
There is no limit to the amount of points one is allowed to purchase.</P>

<P>7. The most notable of the Pepsi Stuff television commercials feature a
new Harrier Jet, among as assortment of other prizes, which are offered
to the general public. As part of the television commercial, PEPSI
conspicuously displayed the amount of Pepsi Points needed to obtain a
particular prize. PEPSI offered the new Harrier Jet in the television
commercial for seven (7) million Pepsi Points.</P>

<P>8. LEONARD first noticed the Pepsi Stuff television commercials offering
the new Harrier Jet in Seattle, Washington, which commercial was also
broadcast in the state of Florida. This television commercial actually
depicts an individual flying to school in his new Harrier Jet and then
offers the jet as one of the Pepsi Stuff prizes.</P>

<P>9. LEONARD, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Pepsi
Stuff promotional campaign, accepted PEPSI's offer of the new Harrier
Jet, by obtaining 15 original Pepsi Points and then purchasing the
remaining Pepsi Points at $.10 a point for 6,999,985 points, for the
total sum of $699,998.50.</P>

<P>10. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD duly tendered the seven (7) million Pepsi
Points to PEPSI in exchange for the new Harrier Jet by delivering to
PEPSI (1) an original Pepsi Stuff order form, (2) 15 original Pepsi
Points, and (3) a check in the amount of $700,008.50 (for the remaining
6,999,985 points, plus shipping and handling), all in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion. A true and
correct copy of those items are attached hereto as Composite Exhibit
"A."</P>

<P>11. Surprisingly, on May 7, 1996, PEPSI, by and through its employees
and/or agents, Young America Corporation, failed and refused to process
the items contained in Composite Exhibit "A" tendered by LEONARD, and
more importantly failed and refused to provide the new Harrier Jet to
LEONARD.</P>

<P>12. On May 14, 1996, LEONARD resubmitted  the original 15 Pepsi Points,
the original order form and check for $700,008.50 (Composite Exhibit
"A"), to PEPSI's Agent, Young America, which was refused a second time.</P>

<P>13. On May 24, 1996, LEONARD resubmitted the entire package (Composite
Exhibit "A") to Pepsi's New York headquarters. PEPSI refused to process
the order as well.</P>

<P>14. To date, despite LEONARD'S reliance on PEPSI'S nationally televised
offer of a new Harrier Jet, in exchange for seven (7) million Pepsi
Points, PEPSI has failed and refused to deliver this prize, thereby
breaching its own offer to the detriment of LEONARD.</P>

<P>15. All conditions precedent to this action have been performed, excused
or waived.</P>

<P>16. LEONARD has retained the undersigned law firm for the purposes of
maintaining this suit and is obligated to pay it a reasonable fee.</P>

<P>COUNT I [Specific Performances]</P>

<P>17. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16
as if fully set forth herein.</P>

<P>18. PEPSI, by and through its national advertising campaign, known as
Pepsi Stuff, offered a new Harrier Jet for sale to the general public
under certain conditions precedent, namely the tender of seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, as more particularly described above.</P>

<P>19. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD, in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion, accepted the offer, met all of
the above conditions precedent (which included providing the advertised
consideration to PEPSI for the new Harrier Jet) and a binding contract
was formed.</P>

<P>20. LEONARD is ready, willing and able to take possession of the new
Harrier Jet, however, PEPSI has failed and refused to fulfill its
contractual obligations to LEONARD by not delivering the new Harrier Jet
in exchange for seven (7) million Pepsi Points tendered by LEONARD.
Accordingly, PEPSI has breached the contract between the parties.</P>

<P>21. Since the subject matter of the contract, a new Harrier Jet, is of
such a special nature and peculiar value and is a specifically
identifiable and inherently unique item, LEONARD is without an adequate
remedy at law to redress his injuries if PEPSI is not required to
perform its obligations under the contract by delivering the new Harrier
Jet to LEONARD.</P>

<P>22. As a direct and proximate result of PEPSI's breach of contract,
LEONARD has and will continue to suffer damages, unless PEPSI completes
its performance of the contract as described above.</P>

<P>WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, LEONARD, prays that this Honorable Court: (1)
exercise its equitable powers over the subject matter of this action
requiring specific performance of the contract as between the parties;
(2) enter a judgment, order or decree directing or otherwise requiring
PEPSI to accept the tender of seven (7) million Pepsi Points from
LEONARD and deliver and/or otherwise transfer the new Harrier Jet to
LEONARD; and (3) fashion any and all appropriate remedies the Court
deems necessary and proper to carry out performance of the contract by
PEPSI to LEONARD.</P>

<P>COUNT II [Breach of Contract (In the Alternative)]</P>

<P>23. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16
as if fully set forth herein.</P>

<P>24. PEPSI, by and through its national advertising campaign, known as
Pepsi Stuff, offered a new Harrier Jet for sale to the general public
under certain conditions precedent, namely the tender of seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, as more particularly described above.</P>

<P>25. On March 28, 1996, LEONARD, in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion, accepted the offer, met all of
the above conditions precedent and a binding contract was formed.</P>

<P>26. PEPSI has failed to fulfill its obligations to LEONARD and more
particularly set forth above and therefore, PEPSI has breached the
contract between the parties.</P>

<P>27. As direct and proximate result of PEPSI's breach of contract,
LEONARD has suffered damages.</P>

<P>WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against Defendant, PEPSI,
for damages, together with attorney's fees and costs.</P>

<P>COUNT III [Fraud]</P>

<P>28. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16
as if fully set forth herein.</P>

<P>29. PEPSI, by and through its nationally advertised television
commercial featuring a new Harrier Jet, made knowingly false statements
and representations to LEONARD, concerning its offer of the new Harrier
Jet as one of the prizes which could be obtained in the Pepsi Stuff
promotional campaign.</P>

<P>30. Specifically, PEPSI misrepresented the fact that a new Harrier Jet
could be acquired by a member of the general public for seven (7)
million Pepsi Points, when in fact, PEPSI had absolutely no intentions
of fulfilling its promise to do so.</P>

<P>31. PEPSI knowingly made these false statements and representations in
its television commercial, which statements were material
misrepresentations of fact, with the intent to induce members of the
general public, such as LEONARD, into purchasing PEPSI products and
thereby increasing its profits. Accordingly, by virtue of its running
the Pepsi Stuff commercial nationwide, it was foreseeable by PEPSI that
the offer of a new Harrier Jet would either directly increase the sale
of its products for Pepsi Points or the purchase of Pepsi Points itself.</P>

<P>32. LEONARD detrimentally relied on PEPSI's false statements of material
fact when on March 28, 1996, LEONARD duly tendered seven (7) million
Pepsi Points to PEPSI in exchange for the new Harrier Jet by delivering
to PEPSI (1) an original Pepsi Stuff order form, (2) 15 original Pepsi
Points, and (3) a check in the amount of $700,008.50 (for the remaining
6,999,985 points, plus shipping and handling), all in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion.</P>

<P>33. As a direct and proximate result of PEPSI's failure and refusal to
honor, accept and process  LEONARD's tender of the items set forth in
Composite Exhibit "A", to obtain seven (7) million Pepsi Points in
exchange for a new Harrier Jet, LEONARD has suffered damages.</P>

<P>WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, LEONARD, demands judgment against Defendant,
PEPSI, for damages and such other and further relief as this Court deems
just and proper and reserves the right to amend the Complaint to seek
punitive damages upon proper proffer pursuant to Florida Statutes.</P>

<P>COUNT IV [Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices]</P>

<P>34.  Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16
as if fully set forth herein.</P>

<P>35. This action is brought against PEPSI pursuant to Florida's Deceptive
and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Sec. 501.201, Florida Statutes, et. seq.</P>

<P>36. PEPSI, through its nationally advertised television commercials as
described above, offered a new Harrier Jet as one of the prizes that
could be obtained in the Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign, which
commercial was broadcast in the state of Florida.</P>

<P>37. PEPSI misrepresented and misled the general public, and particularly
LEONARD, in the television advertisement, by offering a new Harrier Jet
for seven (7) million Pepsi Points, when in fact, PEPSI had absolutely
no intention of fulfilling its promise to do so.</P>

<P>38. PEPSI's failure and refusal to provide LEONARD  with a new Harrier
Jet after LEONARD had accepted its offer by delivering to PEPSI (1) an
original Pepsi Stuff order form, (2) 15 original Pepsi Points, and (3) a
check in the amount of $700,008.50 (for the remaining 6,999,985 points,
plus shipping and handling), all in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Pepsi Stuff promotion, constitutes a willful
violation  of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Sec.
501.201 Florida Statutes, et. seq. and as a direct and proximate result
LEONARD has suffered damages.</P>

<P>WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against Defendant, PEPSI,
for damages, including attorney's fees and costs as provided by statute
and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and
proper.</P>

<P>COUNT V [Misleading Advertising]</P>

<P>39.  Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16
as if fully set forth herein.</P>

<P>40. This action is brought against PEPSI pursuant to Florida's
Fraudulent Practices Act, Sec. 817.41 Florida Statutes (1993).</P>

<P>41. PEPSI, through its nationally advertised television commercials
offering a new Harrier Jet, which a commercial was broadcast in the
state of Florida, made knowingly false, deceptive and misleading
representations to LEONARD, as a member of the general public,
concerning its offer of the new Harrier Jet as one of the prizes which
could be obtained in the Pepsi Stuff promotional campaign.</P>

<P>42. Specifically, PEPSI misrepresented a material fact that a new
Harrier Jet could be acquired for seven (7) million Pepsi Points, when
in fact, PEPSI had absolutely no intentions of fulfilling its promise to
do so.</P>

<P>43. PEPSI knowingly made these false, deceptive and misleading
statements in its television commercial, for the purpose of inducing or
causing members of the general public, and particularly LEONARD, to
purchase its products or Pepsi Points under false pretenses.</P>

<P>44. Such practices constitute a willful violation of Sec. 817.41,
Florida Statutes (1993) and as a direct and proximate result, LEONARD
has suffered damages.</P>

<P>WHEREFORE, Plaintiff LEONARD, demands judgment against Defendant, PEPSI,
for damages, including attorney's fees and costs as provided by statute
and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and
proper.</P>

<P>DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL</P>

<P>45. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury of all issues so triable as a
matter of right.</P>

<P>Respectfully submitted this 6th day of August, 1996.</P>

<P>COMPLAINT</P>

<P>Plaintiff Caldera, Inc., ("Caldera") brings this action against
defendant Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") for damages and injunctive
relief under the antitrust laws of the United States, and for damages in
tort, and demands trial by jury, complaining and alleging as follows: </P>

<P><B>I.  NATURE OF CASE.</B></P>

<P>This action challenges illegal conduct by Microsoft calculated and
intended to prevent and destroy competition in the computer software
industry.  As the United States Department of Justice alleged in United
States vs. Microsoft, Civil No. 94-1564 (D.D.C., Complaint  filed July
15, 1994), Microsoft has violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,
15 U.S.C. Sections 1 and 2.  As outlined in the Justice Department's
complaint, through various unfair and predatory acts, Microsoft has
willfully maintained a monopoly of the  market for MS-DOS operating
system software and functionally- equivalent software (the "DOS
Market").   (For purposes of this complaint, MS-DOS and competing
functionally-equivalent operating system software will be referred to as
"DOS Software.")  Such software is designed to run on personal computers
using Intel x86 or Intel x86-compatible microprocessors ("PCs").  The
Intel x86 class of microprocessors includes Intel 286, 386, 486, Pentium
and Pentium Pro microprocessors, as well as microprocessors manufactured
by other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and
instruction set. </P>

<P>Microsoft has erected artificial barriers to the entry and growth of
competing operating systems vendors through its contractual relations
with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of PCs and other predatory
conduct, which have had the effect of excluding competitors from the DOS
Market, a market in which Microsoft has monopoly power.  These practices
have included the following: </P>

<P>License agreements which required OEMs to pay royalties to Microsoft not
only when they sold PCs containing Microsoft's MS-DOS, but also when
they sold PCs containing competing DOS Software or no DOS Software ("per
processor licenses"); </P>

<P>Unreasonably long terms for license agreements with OEMs for the use of
Microsoft's MS-DOS software; </P>

<P>In lieu of and in addition to per processor licenses, pricing schemes
and other license terms and enforcement practices that effectively have
required OEMs to purchase their entire DOS Software requirements from
Microsoft; </P>

<P>Tying arrangements under which Microsoft required OEMs to purchase
MS-DOS to the exclusion of competing DOS Software products, in
particular DR DOS and Novell DOS, in order to obtain its Windows
software programs or to be given access to other essential information,
product support and service; </P>

<P>False public statements by Microsoft executives, and Windows error
messages, which have misled the market as to possible incompatibility
problems between Microsoft's Windows software programs and non-Microsoft
DOS Software, in particular DR DOS and Novell DOS; and </P>

<P>False public statements by Microsoft executives concerning future
product features and anticipated shipment dates, known in the industry
as "vaporware," timed to match announcements or releases of new versions
of competing DOS Software, in particular DR DOS and Novell DOS.  </P>

<P>These practices have had the purpose and effect of freezing out
competing DOS Software products, in particular DR DOS and Novell DOS,
and thereby entrenching Microsoft as the dominant provider of DOS
Software. </P>

<P>Microsoft's conduct has had a direct, substantial and adverse effect on
competition by raising barriers to entry to competing DOS Software,
foreclosing competition with Microsoft on the basis of price and
performance, and stifling innovation.  Buyers of PCs and software have
thus been forced to pay higher prices for less innovative, inferior
products. </P>

<P>Caldera, has acquired from Novell, Inc. ("Novell"), its DR DOS- and
Novell DOS-related assets, including this claim (the "DR DOS Business"),
pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 23, 1996.  (For
simplicity's sake, DR DOS and Novell DOS are referred to generically
herein as "DR DOS.")  Caldera is therefore entitled to recover damages
from Microsoft for its anticompetitive and illegal conduct.  Moreover,
unless restrained by order of this court, Microsoft will permanently
destroy competition in the DOS Market in the microcomputer software
industry, and Caldera will be artificially and illegally prevented from
realizing the full financial potential of the DOS Business. </P>

<P>The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered a
Final Judgment in United States v. Microsoft on August 21, 1995, which
barred certain of Microsoft's anticompetitive practices, including per
processor licenses, licences exceeding one year in length, licenses
prohibiting or restricting OEMs from licensing or distributing
non-Microsoft operating systems, license agreements conditioning an
OEM's license of one Microsoft operating system product upon the license
of another Microsoft product or upon the OEM not licensing a
non-Microsoft product, minimum commitment licenses, and licenses
requiring royalty payments to Microsoft other than on a per-copy or
per-system basis.  Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sect. 16(i), the statute of
limitations has been suspended as a result of United States v.
Microsoft. </P>

<P><B>II.  THE PARTIES.</B></P>

<P>Plaintiff Caldera is a Utah corporation.  Caldera's principal place of
business is located at 633 South 550 East, Provo, Utah 84606.  Caldera
develops, markets, sells, licenses and services software used with PCs. </P>

<P>Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Novell, Caldera is in the
business of developing, marketing, selling, licensing and servicing DR
DOS products.   Caldera competes with Microsoft in the sale,
distribution and support of DOS Software and other software products via
the Internet, as well as  through traditional OEM, distributor, retailer
and value-added reseller channels. </P>

<P>Defendant Microsoft is a Delaware corporation.  Microsoft's principal
place of business is located at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington,

<P><B>IV. PERSONAL COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY. </B></P>

<P>A. Introduction of the PC</P>

<P>IBM was among the first United States companies to introduce
microcomputers for personal use. IBM introduced the IBM personal
computer in 1981.  It was quickly dubbed the "PC," a term now used (in
this Complaint and generally) to refer to any personal computer that is
IBM-compatible, whether manufactured by IBM or not, i.e., personal
computers that use Intel x86-class microprocessors. </P>

<P>The components of a PC are the hardware (which includes the
microprocessor, the memory and the disk drive), software (which includes
the operating system, other low level programs, and various applications
programs), and peripherals (which include the display screen, keyboard
and printer). </P>

<P>IBM's hardware architecture design was based on a microprocessor chip
designed and manufactured by Intel. So-called "clone" PC manufacturers
also utilize Intel x86-class microprocessors. </P>

<P>The dominant operating system on Intel x86-class microprocessors is
Microsoft's MS-DOS. </P>


<P>B. The Importance of the Operating System Software </P>

<P>The software on a PC can be divided into three basic categories:
operating system software (e.g., MS-DOS), graphical user interface (GUI)
software and applications software. </P>

<P>Applications software gives the PC its functionality and consumer
utility.  Application software provides the PC with instructions for the
performance of tasks selected by the user.  Primary examples of
application software are word processing, spreadsheet, and database
programs. </P>

<P>The operating system controls the basic functions of the PC and
facilitates interaction between application programs and hardware. 
Operating system software performs the following functions: </P>

<P>controlling the allocation and usage of computer hardware components
such as central processing unit, memory, disk space and peripheral
devices; </P>

<P>facilitating the execution of applications software by responding to
requests or "calls" made by the application programs during their
operation that require various hardware components to perform particular
functions; </P>

<P>managing the flow of data and communication among various PC components.</P>


<P>The operating system constitutes the critical layer of software in every
PC.  All other software programs installed by a PC user must work with,
and therefore be compatible with, the particular operating system
running on the PC. </P>

<P>In writing applications for a particular operating system, applications
developers refer to a set of ground rules for that operating system,
known as the Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs).  APIs tell
the application developer what the operating system will do in response
to a defined set of requests or "calls."  As long as an application is
written in accordance with the rules set by the API, the application
will run with a given operating system. </P>

<P>Particular operating systems can only work with a certain type of
microprocessor.  For example, MS-DOS will operate only on PCs, i.e.,
machines that contain Intel x86-class microprocessors.  MS-DOS will not
run on machines manufactured by Apple Computer, which operate on a
non-Intel microprocessor platform. </P>

<P>C.   The Emergence of Graphical User Interfaces ("GUIs"). </P>

<P>MS-DOS is character-based, i.e., most of the visual displays generated
by MS-DOS are limited to blinking cursors, letters and numbers.  To have
the computer perform certain tasks -- such as opening a new file -- the
user must issue instructions by typing in the correct sequence of
letters and numbers or by using rudimentary mouse functions. </P>

<P>Graphical user interface or GUI screen displays include icons or symbols
to represent programs, functions or information.  A GUI, together with a
"mouse" pointing device, allows the user to instruct the computer to
perform specific functions by merely pointing to and "clicking" on
certain graphical images, symbols or words. </P>

<P>In 1985, Microsoft introduced its GUI software, called Windows. </P>

<P>Although sometimes referred to as an operating system, all versions of
Windows, excluding Windows NT and Windows 95, interface with and "run on
top of" DOS Software. Windows adds a GUI interface between DOS and the
user.  Windows takes advantage of more sophisticated microprocessors and
increased memory capacity to generate complex visual displays as part of
its graphical user interface. </P>

<P>D.   Software Distribution Channels</P>

<P>The customer base for DOS Software consists primarily of PC
manufacturers, i.e., OEMs.  This is commonly referred to as the OEM
channel.  DOS Software is also sold at retail, primarily as an upgrade. 
Because virtually all PCs are sold with operating system software
installed, however, there is little opportunity for vendors of DOS
Software to make significant sales in retail channels.  Hence, by
controlling the OEM channel, Microsoft is able to control distribution. </P>

<P>OEM licenses for DOS Software (and also Windows software products)
typically permit the OEM, through the use of a "golden master" diskette
supplied by the software developer (such as Microsoft), to reproduce and
install the software on each PC.  By contrast, applications programs are
generally manufactured onto separate disks and sold in boxes through
retail channels. </P>

<P><B>V.   MICROSOFT'S GROWTH AND DOMINATION.</B></P>

<P>In 1981, IBM contracted with Microsoft to design and develop the
operating system software for the IBM PC. Since it had practically no
background in operating systems, Microsoft entered into an arrangement
with a company known as Seattle Computer Products (SCP) to acquire
rights to a program under development by SCP known as "QDOS" for Quick
and Dirty Operating System. </P>

<P>QDOS borrowed heavily from an operating system developed by Digital
Research, Inc. ("DRI") called CP/M. </P>

<P>Microsoft changed the name of QDOS to MS-DOS, for Microsoft-Disk
Operating System.  Under its arrangement with IBM, Microsoft retained
the right to license MS-DOS to other PC manufacturers.  IBM called its
version of the product PC DOS. </P>

<P>MS-DOS was originally designed to run on the Intel 8088 microprocessor. 
Microsoft has introduced several versions of MS-DOS since 1981, which
have run on the Intel x86 class of microprocessors. </P>

<P>Because Microsoft distributes MS-DOS (and Windows) predominantly through
the OEM channel, its costs of sale are minimal.  Once Microsoft delivers
a master copy of a disk containing the MS-DOS (or Windows) program to a
given OEM, it incurs little or no additional costs of sale. OEMs, on the
other hand, must copy and package disks, prepare product literature, and
ship product to customers. </P>

<P>By the mid-1980's, MS-DOS had become entrenched as the standard in the
DOS Market, generating millions of dollars of revenues to Microsoft. 
Not surprisingly, in view of Microsoft's monopoly power and the absence
of competition, the price of MS-DOS in the OEM channel escalated from
$2-$5 per copy in the 1981-1982 period to $25-$28 per copy by 1988. </P>

<P>At the same time, for much of the 1980s, Microsoft did almost nothing to
improve MS-DOS.  Microsoft released MS-DOS 3.0 in August 1984, but did
not release MS-DOS 4.0 until June 1988, a month after DRI released DR
DOS 3.31. Microsoft did not issue an improved release until June 1991,
when MS-DOS 5.0 appeared in response to DR DOS 5.0 (which was released
in April 1990). </P>

<P><B>VI.  THE DR DOS CHALLENGE.</B></P>

<P>Microsoft's inaction was remarkable given that improvements in hardware
technology and applications software had created a demand among PC users
for an enhanced operating system.  By 1987, users were seeking: </P>

<P>The ability to support larger disk drives.  Although larger hard disks
were becoming available, Microsoft did nothing to improve MS-DOS so that
it could support such hard disks until Compaq developed its own version
of MS-DOS with such functionality. </P>

<P>Improved memory management.  Microsoft did nothing to improve memory
management so that larger applications programs (such as popular desktop
publishing applications) could run on a computer with relatively limited
memory. </P>

<P>Loading the operating system on a ROM chip.  Even though it had become
technologically feasible to install certain portions of operating
systems on a "read only memory" (ROM) chip, a feature that would improve
the function of the program, Microsoft did nothing to create a
"ROM-able" version of MS-DOS. </P>

<P>Improved user interface.  MS-DOS required users to master rather arcane
programming commands in order to perform various operations.  Microsoft
failed to make its commands more user-friendly or to provide any "help"
screen for users to enable them to determine which commands they should
execute. </P>

<P>Because of these deficiencies, a number of OEMs approached DRI and
requested that it develop a version of DOS that would fill the gaps in
functionality that plagued MS-DOS. At the same time, there were a number
of OEMs who simply could not get Microsoft to deal with them
(irrespective of product features).  Many of these OEMs indicated to DRI
that they would be seriously interested in an alternative DOS Software
product.  Accordingly, in 1987 DRI began planning for a new version of
DOS, to be called DR DOS. </P>

<P>DRI designed DR DOS to be the functional equivalent of MS-DOS, i.e., to
support the same API set.  DRI was able to accomplish this largely
because of its experience in the development of CP/M, from which QDOS
and MS-DOS derived. </P>

<P>The result of DRI's initial development effort was a product designated
as DR DOS 3.31, introduced on May 28, 1988.  DR DOS 3.31 was followed
quickly by enhanced versions of the product.  Thus DR DOS 5.0,
introduced in May 1990, and DR DOS 6.0, introduced in September 1991,
were significantly superior to then-existing versions of MS-DOS in many
areas, including (a) memory management, (b) a ROM-able core of the
operating system, (c) user-friendly commands and on-screen help
resources, (d) a graphical user interface option, (e) extended disk
commands, (f) password protection, and (g) the ability to store twice as
much information on a hard disk through disk compression technology. </P>

<P>Industry experts responded enthusiastically to DR DOS.  DR DOS 5.0
received several awards including the 1990 BYTE Award of Distinction and
Finalist in the 1990 PC Magazine Award for Technical Excellence.  DR DOS
6.0 similarly received a number of industry awards, including the 1991
BYTE Award of Excellence, BEST of COMDEX (Fall 1991), and the Infoworld
Buyers Assurance Seal. </P>

<P>The technical superiority of DR DOS resulted in a rise in sales from
about $15 million in fiscal year 1990 to $30 million in fiscal year
1991, notwithstanding Microsoft's anticompetitve conduct.  DR DOS sold
well in the retail distribution channel, but due to Microsoft's
exclusive dealings and other predatory conduct, it was largely locked
out of the OEM channel. </P>

<P><B>VII. MICROSOFT'S PREDATORY RESPONSE TO DR DOS.</B> </P>

<P>Microsoft refused to tolerate this PCs to its monopoly position in the
DOS Market for at least two (to Microsoft) compelling reasons:  (i)
Microsoft's DOS Market monopoly enabled it to control the standards or
APIs to which all applications for IBM-compatible PCs had to be written;
and (ii) MS-DOS enabled Microsoft to collect enormous amounts of money
from its license of MS-DOS at negligible ongoing cost or risk. </P>

<P>DR DOS posed a particularly significant threat to Microsoft because (i)
it was compatible with applications written for MS-DOS; and (ii) since
both DR DOS and MS-DOS were technological successors to CP/M, Microsoft
could not claim that DR DOS infringed upon any proprietary technology it
owned. </P>

<P>Microsoft's principal defense against any competitive threat, including
DR DOS, was the wall of "per processor" licenses that it had begun to
construct in 1988, the year that DR DOS was first released to the
market.  Under per processor licenses, OEMs were required to pay
Microsoft a royalty on every PC they sold regardless of whether it
contained Microsoft's MS-DOS, some other software developer's DOS
Software, or no operating system software. This royalty system
effectively imposed a tax in favor of Microsoft whenever an OEM sold a
PC equipped with any operating system other than MS-DOS.  Given the
razor-thin margins on the sale of PCs, this royalty scheme caused OEMs
to ship MS-DOS exclusively. </P>

<P>Microsoft compounded this per processor licensing scheme by insisting on
long-term licenses of MS-DOS from its OEM customers, contracts that
tended to be longer than typical product cycles.  Microsoft also
obtained large "take or pay" minimum commitment licenses that also
effectively foreclosed the ability of competitors such as Novell to sell
competing DOS Software products to OEMs, and engaged in other licensing
practices that had the effect of coercing OEMs to deal exclusively with
Microsoft. </P>

<P>Microsoft responded to DR DOS 5.0 by announcing in May 1990 that it
intended to issue a new release of MS-DOS, to be called MS-DOS 5.0, that
would mirror the technical advantages already present in DR DOS 5.0. 
Microsoft indicated that the new release of MS-DOS would be available
within a few months.  Industry experience indicates that it would have
been near impossible for Microsoft to develop and release a commercial
version of its product matching the features of DR DOS 5.0 within that
period. Nonetheless, Microsoft repeated this vaporware announcement
throughout the summer and into the fall of 1990.  In fact, MS-DOS 5.0
was not released until June 1991 and, when finally released, it did not
offer the features Microsoft had promised. </P>

<P>On July 17, 1991, DRI, finding it difficult to compete in the face of
Microsoft's onslaught, announced its agreement to be acquired by Novell.
 The merger was completed October 28, 1991.  With the financial,
research and development, and marketing support of Novell, DR DOS could
have obtained a significant share of the DOS Market, but for Microsoft's
anticompetitive conduct. </P>

<P>In the fall of 1991, Microsoft announced to the market that DR DOS would
not be compatible with the next release of Windows known as Windows 3.1,
scheduled for release in April 1992.  The market perceived that it was
critical for an operating system to support Windows;  therefore
Microsoft's statements that DR DOS could not do so substantially
undercut Novell's efforts to penetrate the DOS Market. </P>

<P>To reinforce the impression that DR DOS would be incompatible with
Windows 3.1, beginning in December of 1991, Microsoft released beta
versions of Windows 3.1 containing code that generated error messages
when Windows 3.1 ran on top of DR DOS rather than MS-DOS.  Microsoft
created these error messages solely for the purpose of creating the
impression that DR DOS would be incompatible with Windows in order to
dissuade customers from purchasing DR DOS. </P>

<P>Even though the Windows 3.1 beta release was at that time the largest
such release in history, Microsoft refused to provide a Windows 3.1 beta
to Novell.  Microsoft's refusal to do so was another predatory effort to
impede Novell's ability to test DR DOS with Windows 3.1 and thereby
hamper Novell's ability to offer a Windows 3.1-compatible release of DR
DOS to the market.    In fact, when Windows 3.1 was finally released to
the market, Novell was able to release an enhanced version of DR DOS
supporting Windows 3.1 without substantial technical difficulty. </P>

<P>Microsoft also informed certain OEM PC manufacturers that they could not
obtain Windows or be given access to essential information, product
support and service if  they did not purchase and ship MS-DOS, to the
exclusion of DR DOS. </P>

<P>Similarly, Microsoft established a pricing structure for Windows that
made it prohibitive to buy that product in the absence of MS-DOS.  For
example, certain Korean OEMs were informed that the price of Windows
without MS-DOS would be double the price of Windows with MS-DOS. </P>

<P>Microsoft's most devastating tactic, however, was its massive expansion
of per processor licenses in the OEM channel.  Following the
announcement of Novell's acquisition of DRI, Microsoft substantially
stepped up its efforts to coerce OEMs to enter into per processor
licenses or comparably exclusionary MS-DOS licenses.  Thereafter,
Novell's sales force found the OEM channel virtually impenetrable; they
were thwarted in account by account by Microsoft's per-processor license
wall. </P>

<P>The combined effect of Microsoft's anticompetitive practices on DR DOS
was devastating.  DR DOS sales plummeted during fiscal year 1992,
totaling $15.5 million in the first quarter,  $13.7 million in the
second quarter, $6.9 million in the third quarter, and $1.4 million in
the fourth quarter (which ended October 31, 1992). </P>

<P>Microsoft continued with its predatory practices throughout 1992 and up
to the present day.  Microsoft has employed another tactic for locking
OEMs exclusively to MS-DOS, namely, "cliff pricing" through which a
commercially-reasonable price is provided to OEMs if and only if they
commit to obtain all of their requirements for operating system software
from Microsoft. </P>

<P>Although various governmental agencies including the United States
Department of Justice have sought to bar certain of Microsoft's
predatory practices such as the per processor license, Microsoft has
been permitted to employ its "cliff pricing" practice with impunity.  </P>

<P>Novell introduced its final version of the product, Novell DOS 7.0, in
the summer of 1993.  In September 1994, as a result of Microsoft's
predatory and anticompetitive conduct described herein, Novell announced
that it would cease the marketing and development of DR DOS. </P>

<P><B>VIII.     RELEVANT MARKETS.</B></P>


<P>There are two relevant product markets: (i) the DOS Market; and (ii) the
market for graphical user interfaces that run on top of DOS Software
(the "GUI Market"). </P>

<P>The relevant geographic market is the United States. Microsoft sells and
licenses MS-DOS throughout the United States.  The major developers of
other DOS Software are exclusively U.S. companies. </P>

<P>Microsoft has monopoly power in the DOS Market and the GUI Market.  In
fact, according to the Justice Department's complaint, "Microsoft has
monopoly power in the relevant market and has had monopoly power since
at least the mid-1980s.  For almost a decade Microsoft has retained an
extremely high market share -- consistently in excess of 70%." 
Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows are the de facto software standards for
the Intel x86 class of microprocessors. </P>

<P>Microsoft's control of MS-DOS and Windows standards for Intel x86-class
microprocessors provides it with several significant advantages over
competitors, including the following: </P>

<P>Because of Microsoft's large installed base, for competing DOS Software
products to have any chance of commercial success, they must provide the
functionality of Microsoft's MS-DOS so that they can support graphical
user interfaces and applications written for MS-DOS; </P>

<P>Because Microsoft has early access to its own MS-DOS and Windows APIs,
it can develop and deliver complementary products to market more quickly
than competitors whose complementary software products must be
compatible with Microsoft's products; </P>

<P>By changing APIs, or refusing to support certain APIs in newer versions
of its MS-DOS and Windows products, Microsoft can render competitors'
complementary products technologically incompatible; and </P>

<P>Microsoft has power over OEMs, such that they can influence OEMs'
decisions whether to purchase software products offered by Microsoft
competitors. </P>

<P>As a result of these and other advantages, Microsoft holds and has
exercised power to exclude competitors and increase prices in the DOS
Market and the GUI Markets. </P>

<P><B>FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B></P>

<P>MONOPOLIZATION OF DOS MARKET</P>

<P>(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 2)</P>

<P>Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges the averments of Paras.
1-60 as if fully set forth herein. </P>

<P>Microsoft has monopolized the DOS Market in violation of Sect. 2 of the
Sherman Act.  There is no legitimate business justification or purpose
for Microsoft's conduct. Microsoft has not used the least restrictive
means for achieving its business objectives. </P>

<P>The aforesaid conduct of defendant Microsoft has produced and, unless
restrained by Order of this Court, will continue to produce the
following anticompetitive effects, among others: </P>

<P>Competition in the manufacture, sale and distribution of operating
system software, particularly DOS Software, has been unreasonably
restrained and eliminated, and has been monopolized by defendant
Microsoft; </P>

<P>Competition with defendant Microsoft in the DOS Market, including
competition by Novell and Caldera, has been or will be eliminated; </P>

<P>Barriers to entry in the DOS Market have been raised to a virtually
insurmountable level, thereby assuring continued unlawful maintenance of
Microsoft's monopoly and Microsoft's ability to exercise its monopoly
power to control prices and eliminate competition; and </P>

<P>Innovation and the development of new and more efficient operating
system software has been retarded and is in danger of ceasing. </P>

<P>As a direct and proximate result of the predatory acts and practices
alleged above, the DR DOS Business, which plaintiff Caldera has
acquired, is being and will continue to be immediately and irreparably
injured through the following: </P>

<P>The loss of profits that otherwise would have been earned from the sale
of DR DOS and related PC operating system software; </P>

<P>The loss of sales of DR DOS and related PC operating system software
that otherwise would have been made; </P>

<P>The loss of market presence for DR DOS, as well as the loss of market
share that might otherwise have been achieved in a freely competitive
market; </P>

<P>The substantial reduction in the value of the DR DOS Business assets; </P>

<P>The loss of good will in the DR DOS Business as a going concern; and </P>

<P>The loss to the DR DOS Business of skilled engineering, product
development and marketing personnel and the erosion of its sales and
service organization. </P>

<P>The precise amount of damages that Caldera is entitled to recover as a
result of the foregoing injuries to the DOS Business has not yet been
ascertained. </P>

<P>In addition, defendant Microsoft's monopolization of the DOS Market is
an ongoing wrong causing the DR DOS Business incalculable and
irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  Unless
defendant Microsoft is restrained by an appropriate Order of this Court,
Caldera will be unable to compete fully and fairly in the DOS Market. </P>

<P><B>SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B></P>

<P>ILLEGAL TYING</P>

<P>(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 1)</P>

<P>Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges each and every
allegation contained in Paras. 1-66 as if fully set forth herein. </P>

<P>Microsoft has coerced OEMs to enter into unreasonable and
anticompetitive tying arrangements in the form of licenses to MS-DOS. 
In furtherance of its illegal tying arrangements, Microsoft engaged in
the following conduct, among other things: </P>

<P>Demanded that OEMs license MS-DOS in order to obtain a license to
Windows; </P>

<P>Set royalty rates on unbundled Windows licenses, i.e., licenses to use
Windows only without a license to MS-DOS, such that the only viable
economic option for OEMs was to license both MS-DOS (the tied product)
and Windows (the tying product) from Microsoft; </P>

<P>Conditioned access to the Windows product as well as critical technical
information, product support and service for both MS-DOS and Windows on
the purchase of MS-DOS to the exclusion of DR DOS; and </P>

<P>Tied MS-DOS and Windows technologically by deliberately creating
technological incompatibilities offering no technical benefit solely for
the purpose of creating the impression that DR DOS was incompatible with
Windows. </P>

<P>Many OEMs did not and do not wish to license MS-DOS from Microsoft on
the terms imposed and many users would have preferred to run DR DOS with
Windows but for the fears of incompatibility created by Microsoft. </P>

<P>Microsoft has appreciable market power in the GUI Market due to, among
other things, (i) its dominant market share; (ii) its copyrighted
Windows product; and (iii) its unique MS-DOS-compatible graphical user
interface. </P>

<P>Novell competed with Microsoft in attempting to license its DR DOS
operating system to OEMs and in attempting to license DR DOS directly to
end users at retail.  As a direct result of Microsoft's tying
arrangements as described above, Novell and other competitors were
foreclosed from selling DOS Software to a substantial portion of the
market. </P>

<P>Microsoft's illegal tie-ins have resulted in actual substantial
foreclosure of DR DOS from the DOS Market. Competition in the DOS Market
 has been reduced because of Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct. </P>

<P>Microsoft's tying arrangements constitute contracts in unreasonable
restraint of trade in or affecting a substantial volume of interstate
commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sect.1.</P>


<P>The DR DOS Business, now owned by Caldera, suffered injury by reason of
these acts.  The precise amount of damages has not yet been ascertained.</P>


<P><B>THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B></P>

<P>EXCLUSIVE DEALING</P>

<P>(Violation of Sherman Act, Section 1)</P>

<P>Caldera incorporates by reference and realleges the averments of Paras.
1-74 as if fully set forth herein. </P>

<P>Microsoft has coerced OEMs to enter into long-term exclusive dealing
arrangements for MS-DOS.  These exclusive dealing contracts have taken
the form of per-processor licenses, cliff pricing, volume discounts,
coercive royalty schedules and other licensing terms and practices
having the purpose and the practical effect of forcing OEMs to purchase
all of their DOS Software requirements from a single seller --
Microsoft. </P>

<P>The effect of Microsoft's exclusive dealing arrangements was to
effectively foreclose a substantial number of prospective customers,
particularly OEMs, from purchasing DR DOS.  OEMs who would like to have
licensed DR DOS have been precluded from doing so by their per processor
and other exclusive licenses with Microsoft. </P>

<P>The actual and probable effect of Microsoft's exclusive dealing
arrangements has been to raise prices above the competitive level and
substantially lessen competition in the DOS Market.  Microsoft possesses
monopoly power and has used and, continues to use, exclusive dealing
arrangements with OEMs to raise barriers to entry and foreclose actual
and potential competition. </P>

<P>There is no legitimate business justification for Microsoft's exclusive
dealing arrangements. </P>

<P>The above-described exclusive dealing arrangements imposed by Microsoft 
constitute contracts in unreasonable restraint of trade in or affecting
a substantial volume of interstate commerce in violation of Section 1 of
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sect. 1. </P>

<P>Caldera's DOS Business has been injured by reason of these acts.  The
precise amount of damages has not yet been ascertained. </P>

<P><B>FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B></P>

<P>TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS </P>

(VOLUME IX - SUPPRESSION HEARING and HEARING ON MOTIONS) </P>





<P>Proceedings before the HONORABLE RICHARD P. MATSCH, 

Judge, United States District Court for the District of 

Colorado, commencing at 9:00 a.m., on the 15th day of July, 

1996, in Courtroom C-204, United States Courthouse, Denver, 

Colorado.</P>

Computer by Paul Zuckerman, 1929 Stout Street, P.O. Box 3563, Denver,

Colorado, 80294, (303) 629-9285 </P>



<P>THE COURT:  Well, I'm taking this motion under 

advisement.  I think I have to consider both the suppression 

and this together.  Obviously, they're connected. 

The issue of compliance with the new legislation for 

closed circuit television transmission of trial proceedings to 

Oklahoma City is the next issue.  The Government filed its 

motion on this.  Defendants filed their respective objections 

and the Government reply; so we've got extensive briefing on 

this as well.  I indicated that we would give some time for 

argument here simply on the question of the constitutionality 

of this provision, recognizing, of course, that the actual 

application of it requires further consideration and what 

conditions and what the methodology is and all that has to be 

considered; but we're ready to go on the objections that have 

been raised that include the arguments with respect to 

separation of powers, bill of attainder, Fifth and Sixth 

Amendments, and the like.</P>



<P>I'll hear any supplement to the brief by argument if 

you wish to make it.  Mr. Tigar, I see you rising for that 

purpose, I presume.</P>



<P>DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION 

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  I'll not repeat what we 

said in the brief about statutory interpretation. 

This statute caught us by surprise.  There are those 

in New York that Nicholas Pileggi calls "wise guys" who dream 

of a racetrack in which the numbers are put on the horses after 

the race is run.  We made -- that's how we feel.  We made an 

argument to your Honor at the change of venue hearing that was 

directed at moving the case to Denver, and in that I 

consciously made a decision that we would not seek a change of 

venue to places that we thought might be even better for us in 

terms of jury selection.  I had already spoken to two district 

judges in the Ninth Circuit who had approached me about trying 

the case in San Francisco or Seattle -- that was at the Ninth 

Circuit judicial conference; but if your Honor will recall, I 

was conscious of the fact that a United States attorney was 

going to make a presentation about the rights of victims and so 

we decided to try to head that off by seeking a venue that, as 

I said in argument, was a reasonable short air flight from 

Oklahoma City; that is to say, Denver, where the transportation 

facilities would accommodate those interests.  And the Court 

will recall that the United States Attorney made a tearful and 

empassioned speech with respect to victims' rights. 

So after we had done that, after we made all our 

arguments, after we're committed, the Congress goes and passes 

this statute.  Why does this statute violate the Constitution? 

First, it violates the equal protection clause as that is 

construed in Romer vs. Evans, 116 Supreme Court 1620.  The 

wonderful thing about Romer and Justice Kennedy's opinion is 

that it tells us that equal protection of the laws is not 

achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities; 

that the desire to harm an unpopular group cannot constitute a 

legitimate governmental suppress.</P>



<P>This statute is like the constitutional provision 

declared invalid in Romer; that is to say, it is impossible to 

believe that this statute has any purpose other than hostility 

to the proclaimed desire of these defendants to have a trial 

free from the diversion of television cameras.  This statute, 

unless that purpose be the other one, of contradicting what 

your Honor had said; that is to say, a resolute desire to 

enforce the provisions of Federal Rule 53, which the Tenth 

Circuit has just this week told us -- just last week told us 

means exactly what it says and what your Honor says it says. 

The statute, in addition to having no legitimate 

governmental purpose, is utterly irrational.  First, it burdens 

the defendant who seeks an interstate change of venue, although 

movement from one state to another penalizing that is itself 

suspect under the equal protection clause.  It doesn't burden 

the defendant who wants a change of venue from Beaumont to El 

Paso, a distance of 888 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant 

who wants a change of venue, indeed, within a single district 

from Austin to El Paso, 683 miles, San Antonio to El Paso, 

560 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant who wants a change of 

venue from Redding, a place for holding court, to Los Angeles, 

546; Redding to San Diego, 690.</P>



<P>At the same time, your Honor, by saying that the out 

of state must be matched with the 350 miles, of course, had I 

known that the cost -- the cost to my client would have been by 

seeking a change more than 350 miles -- would have been we had 

to have television, well, your Honor, there are some other 

venues I could have had out of state.  The last case Mr. Woods 

and I tried a verdict was in Tarrant County, your Honor -- 

that's Fort Worth -- and our client was acquitted.  Senator 

Hutchison.  A Terrin County jury would be just fine for us; an 

Amarillo jury, your Honor, Judge Mary Lou Robinson; a Lubbock 

jury, Judge, Cummings, less than 350 miles, and that's a choice 

that we could have made.</P>



<P>But the statute -- see, the statute, first it says out 

of state.  Now, the out of state part we show is irrational 

because the fact is that within single states, you can have 

enormous distances and enormous differences that are based on 

those as between east and west Texas.  By putting in the 

350 miles, the statute also makes no sense because 350 miles 

can be exceeded by an intrastate transfer, and a distance of 

350 miles has nothing whatever to do with the relative 

convenience of air transport; that is to say it is as 

inconvenient to get from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth as it is 

to get from Oklahoma City to Denver.</P>



<P>The statute makes no sense.  The classification it 

establishes makes no sense.  It denies these defendants, 

therefore, the equal protection of the laws.  And what equal 

protection means is the protection that Rule 53 was in its 

inception and in the consistent course of Judicial Conference 

decision designed to confirm.</P>



<P>It is a protection which we cited in our brief to the 

Tenth Circuit that was a part of their mandamus decision noting 

that Rule 53 has been carried into effect in district after 

district, including this one, by an express prohibition not 

only upon cameras in the courtroom, but upon the sort of 

studied evasion that the press was attempting to do and that 

your Honor wisely put a stop to.</P>



<P>So that is the point, your Honor.  We cited Romer vs.  

Evans to the court, and we cited Yik Wo; but Justice Kennedy's 

opinion, when read, I think makes our argument more eloquently 

than we could in our papers and, certainly, more fully than we 

did.</P>



<P>With respect to separation of powers, were the power 

of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of 

the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control.  That's what 

Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 47.  And he cited 

Montesquieu's Spirit of the Law, a treatise that was well known 

to the framers of the Constitution and which as has indeed, if 

Westlaw is correct, been cited some 13 times since 1945 in 

Supreme Court opinions dealing with separation of powers. 

It is not, however, simply the abstract concern with 

separation of powers that motivates our argument.  The fact is 

that all defense counsel had said that they did not want to 

risk a repeat of some media circus in this case no matter what 

the controls; so our position was clear. 

Your Honor -- and I can recall it clearly -- had a 

shouted question that came at him in the Oklahoma City airport 

and had said that Rule 53 would be observed.  A significant 

observation.  I don't think a controversial ones.  All courts 

that have looked at these matters, even in highly publicized 

matters, have said that Rule 53 means what it says. 

And so this legislation was designed to tell your 

Honor, Judge Matsch, This is the Article I Congress people. 

Hello, Article III Judge; this is how you're supposed to decide 

the particular issue that is before you.  Oh, and by the way, 

Judge Matsch, says the Congress, do that after the defendants 

have taken a position in reliance upon the law as it stood. 

That, if the Court please, is directly contrary to the 

teaching of Plaut, it's directly contrary to the teaching of 

Klein.</P>



<P>The Government's response is interesting.  I made the 

statutory interpretation argument in part because I believe 

that having drafted the statute, the Government has to live by 

it.  The thorns which they have reaped are of the tree they 

planted; however, I also knew that the Government would come 

back and tell your Honor, as it predictably did, don't read the 

text of the statute.  The text of the statute is only relevant 

when the legislative history is vague.  That's not the way I 

learned the rule, but let's take the Government at its word. 

The legislative history, say they, was designed to 

tell your Honor, and Article III judge, exactly how to rule on 

a pending issue in this case.  And so the Government, in 

seeking to avoid the thrust of one of our arguments, has 

impaled itself upon the other.  That, it seems to me, makes 

inescapable the conclusion that this legislation is invalid for 

those reasons.</P>



<P>And I turn finally, then, to the due process concern, 

which is slightly different from the equal protection concern 

but based on the same idea.  All of us in this case have 

striven, with a little mutual recrimination, to be sure -- but 

all of us have striven in the best way that we can to keep from 

making this case into a media circus.  I think that we have 

been conscious of our professional obligations, although some 

of us have seen fit to do -- to try to discharge them 

differently; but the fact is we've all tried to do it. 

And what we get for that is a declaration that this 

courtroom is to be subject to the paraphernalia of cameras, 

something that helps to turn the courtroom into something that 

the Supreme Court warned against in Estes vs. Texas and 

something that will make it much more difficult to have the 

atmosphere of dispassionate judgment that all of us here at one 

time or another have at least professed to want. 

Moreover, the dangers attendant upon peopling -- or 

having the courtroom filled with microphones are ones to which 

I need not avert.  They are ones that we averted to in our 

filing in the Tenth Circuit with respect to mandamus and which 

I think it is clear that the Tenth Circuit, following your 

Honor's lead, has already told us are of sufficient weight to 

have led that court to deny the mandamus last week and uphold 

your Honor's position.</P>



<P>For all of those reasons -- and since your Honor 

invited me to talk about the Constitution, I've done it -- but 

plus my insistence that the text of this statute means what it 

says, as the Supreme Court has often told us.  We ask that the 

Government's motion be denied.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, are you speaking to this? 

DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION 

MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, your Honor, when 

the Constitutional Convention finished its work in Philadelphia 

and it required for its labors to bear fruit that nine of the 

twelve states must ratify it -- and, of course, we recall that 

New York was the pivotal state -- three of the members of the 

convention, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, 

wrote a series of essays that we have come to know as The  

Federalist Papers in an attempt to persuade the legislature of 

the State of New York to ratify the Constitution.  And the 

heart of those Federalist Papers is, of course, No. 10; and in 

Federalist Paper No. 10, Madison and Hamilton and Jay set forth 

and addressed the principal concern that must have been in the 

minds of rural legislators in deciding whether to ratify the 

Constitution, and that is just how powerful would the new 

Federal Government be.</P>



<P>And they assured their audience that the new 

Constitution had within it two basic fundamental principles 

that would forever guide the new government and serve as a 

protection.  The first of those was the concept of federalism, 

divided authority between the federal and state governments; 

but the second one is the one that Mr. Tigar references, and 

that is the separation of powers.  In fact, Mr. Madison in 

writing that particular essay went on to say the very heart of 

the machine to preserve liberty is to be found in the 

separation of powers.</P>



<P>Now, the issue before the Court cannot be one that the 

Court would invite.  We're all familiar, we learned it in the 

first week in law school, that courts strive to avoid declaring 

an act unconstitutional.  If there is some way to save the 

legislation, it is to be saved.  If it is unconstitutional but 

its inapplicability can be determined on other grounds, courts 

prefer that.  And in some respect, I think that even arguing 

with this issue today is a vain and useless thing because from 

the state of the technology, I think it is clear that when we 

have the hearing -- if, in fact, there is one -- that the 

requirements that Congress passed on the security of the signal 

will be found wanting.  If hackers can break into computers and 

signals of missile ranges and city electrical systems and all 

of the other things that we know occur, they can certainly 

break into this one.</P>



<P>But that's not the issue before us today.  And this 

issue really doesn't affect the guilt or innocence of the 

defendants; and it might seem to be a peripheral issue, but it 

isn't.  It goes at the very heart of the type of government 

that we have.</P>



<P>And we are asking the Court to do something that 

probably less than 50 federal judges in the entire history of 

this country -- that is, below the Supreme Court level -- have 

done, which is to declare an act of the Congress passed almost 

2 to 1 and signed into law by the President of the United 

States to be unconstitutional.  All the more difficult a 

challenge and invitation to this court, because this statute is 

aimed at your Honor.  It's not only aimed at your Honor, it's 

aimed at a specific act that your Honor undertook on 

February 27 when you announced, as Mr. Tigar said, that there 

would be no television broadcasting from this courtroom.  And 

in April, Congress decided to overrule your Honor.  And if 

there is any doubt that they had specifically in mind 

overruling your Honor and talked about your Honor's ruling on 

the floor of the Congress, it can be found in the daily issues 

of The Congressional Record, and I'll be glad to give you the 

citation.</P>



<P>That is why we say -- and I am not going to repeat 

what's in the brief.  We talk about those lofty principles -- 

and they are lofty -- bill of attainder and ex post facto and 

separation of powers.  But there can be no more clear example 

of the interference with the judiciary's independence, 

authority, and authority than to take a decision that your 

Honor has made and overturn it by legislation.  Not that your 

Honor's decision was wrong.  Rule 53 is clear.  Your Honor's 

decision was correct.  And we invite the Court to find the 

gloss on Rule 53 that Justice Frankfurter found in the 

Youngstown Sauer case involving the seizure of the steel mills 

by President Truman in 1952; that the Judicial Conference and 

the judiciary and Supreme Court have spoken so consistently and 

so uniformly in an unbroken record of 60 years that there will 

be no broadcasting of criminal federal -- federal criminal 

trials; that somewhere along the line that had to pass into an 

area uniquely controlled by the judiciary. 

And as I have elsewhere, and I say it with all 

friendship for Congressman Lucas, a friend of mine -- and I've 

contributed to his campaigns and plan to do so again, have 

entertained him in my house; but he can no more tell you to put 

a television in this courtroom than you can tell him to put a 

television in his office.</P>



<P>It surely needs no elaboration.  This is a political 

decision made by politicians who sought to seize the moment, 

and not even most of the victims asked for it. 

So all of those reasons why we don't permit television 

cameras which are summarized at 381 U.S. 540 through 551 in 

Estes vs. Texas are applicable to the very issue here.  But 

specifically, there are four points -- and I'll just mention 

them very briefly -- that trouble us about this act as applied 

to this case.  I won't go into the one that Mr. Tigar did 

except to say that, of course, it does discourage and burden 

change of venue motions that defendants must file.  But leaving 

that aside, there are four others.</P>



<P>First, of course, there is no provision in this 

statute for the public and no provision for the families of the 

defendants, who certainly are inconvenienced through no fault 

of their own and have a compelling interest in attending this 

trial.  But if we read the language of the statute itself, it 

does not apply to this case for the reasons initially submitted 

by Mr. Tigar, because it only applies where there is an out of 

state change in which the case was initially brought -- which 

clearly that is satisfied -- more than 350 miles from the 

location in which those proceedings originally would have taken 

place.</P>



<P>Well, the antecedent for the clause those proceedings 

originally would have taken place is the trial.  This trial was 

never scheduled for Oklahoma City.  It has been scheduled only 

in Lawton, Oklahoma and moved here.  So even if there is a 

signal to be sent back, it has to be sent back to Lawton. 

There is no court order, no minute, no determination that this 

trial would ever be held in Oklahoma City. 

</P><P>

Secondly, I adopt the argument Mr. Tigar made in his 

brief that under the plain wording of this statute, not even 

the 350-mile requirement is met.  This statute requires the 

Court already burdened with the motions and the trial 

preparation to do three other things that it ordinarily would 

not have to do.  Actually, four.  First, the Court must 

determine the location.  Secondly, it has to determine those 

persons who have a compelling interest in doing so and are 

otherwise unable to do so by reason of inconvenience and 

expense.  So that's the second and third finding the Court has 

to make.</P>



<P>And the Court has a fourth finding, and that is under 

paragraph 2, that you must determine for each of those 

individuals whether the testimony by that person, if they 

testified at trial, would be materially affected if that person 

heard other testimony at the trial.</P>



<P>We do not know how many people will seek to avail 

themselves of these proceedings; but if the public statements 

are correct that just the core, to use an overworked expression 

today, victims of 2200 -- let's just say that a fourth of them 

sought to avail themselves of this statute, the Court would 

have to determine the status of 550 people and the legislation 

gives no guidance to the Court whether it's an adversarial 

process, whether there is a public hearing, whether we have the 

right to challenge any of those people or whether Mr. Nichols 

has the right or, for that matter, the Government. 

But let us suppose that there are more than 500. 

Let's suppose there is 5,000.  We're going to have a Yankee 

Stadium setting much like the early days of Fidel Castro's 

republic with a giant television screen in which there will be 

several thousand, certainly several hundred people that might 

want to go there.  And we all know that there are a certain 

number of people that follow the firetruck to every fire. 

There are large number of people in this case who have sought 

to involve themselves in it, inappropriately so. 

So how many of them are going to try to take advantage 

of this and come down and have their 15 minutes of fame or 

7 1/2 minutes of fame to show that they're entitled to watch 

this?  Because they have a claim?</P>



<P>And I'm not referring to those people -- I don't call 

them victims, I call them survivors.  I think that's what they 

are and how they should be addressed who obviously have a very 

real and personal interest in attending these proceedings.  But 

there is no way to work that to their exclusion -- I mean only 

to their inclusion.</P>



<P>Finally, there is another provision in this statute 

that is carefully drawn, which is very troublesome and that is 

the provision that says nothing in this section shall be 

construed -- and then it goes down to the second what I call 

double little (i), to provide any person with a defense in any 

action in which application of this section is made. 

I have read the entire legislative history and could 

not find a single word in the Congressional debate or the 

conference committee report that interpreted that section; so I 

have to take it at its face value.  And plainly what they're 

trying to do is to prevent us from raising an Estes vs. Texas 

argument on appeal.  Having overruled your Honor and having 

told you that you have to do it, if our client or Mr. Tigar's 

client is convicted, we can't raise that on appeal and that is 

the only issue upon which Mr. Estes got certiorari and got his 

conviction overturned.</P>



<P>So we respectfully submit to the Court that although 

this statute was introduced, I think, for blatant political 

purposes and in this case plays out against those on both sides 

and although many of the survivors have a legitimate concern 

and interest in this legislation, that in the final analysis, 

the truth of the matter is that this bar right here separates 

us from the mob.  This side of the bar is the sanctuary in the 

jungle that Mr. Tigar talked about at the change of venue 

hearing; and anyone who doubts that with the slightest 

encouragement or inattention that that bar would be pushed down 

and that the vigilante system of justice would pervade this 

case simply does not understand what is at issue. 

</P><P>

And in the final analysis, the only person, as Learned 

Hand says, that protects us in the spirit of liberty is the 

trial court.  It's your Honor.  You either shut the door or you 

open the door; and in this case, all of us know why this 

statute was passed.  All of us know what is the issue here; and 

there must be -- and I submit there is in the brief -- adequate 

reason to declare it either unconstitutional or inapplicable as 

poorly written to the facts of this case. 

THE COURT:  Who speaks for the Government on this? 

Somebody other than Mr. Connelly.</P>



<P>MS. BEHENNA:  We decided to give him a rest for a 

moment.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  All right.</P>



<P>PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION 

MS. BEHENNA:  Thank you, your Honor.</P>



<P>With the Court's ruling earlier, I will not discuss 

the implementation problems that Mr. Jones just raised. 

THE COURT:  That's right.</P>



<P>MS. BEHENNA:  I will narrow this to the constitutional 

challenges raised by the defendants in this case.  Mr. Jones 

made a comment that the victims have a legitimate interest in 

this case.  I submit to the Court that they have a statutory 

right to view these criminal proceedings.  In 1990, Congress 

enacted the Victims -- let me get the correct name here -- the 

Victims Compensation and Assistance Act.  In that act, Congress 

recognized certain rights of victims of crime.  One of those 

rights was to declare victims to have the right to view, to be 

present at all criminal proceedings in matters. 

That interest --</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Well, they have the right to be notified 

of them.</P>



<P>MS. BEHENNA:  The statute provides they have the right 

to be present, your Honor.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Well, read that to me.</P>



<P>MS. BEHENNA:  It states specifically at Item No. 4, 

rights of victims:  A crime victim has the following 

rights . . .  No. 4, the right to be present at all public 

court proceedings relating to the offense unless the court 

determines that the testimony of a victim would be --" and 

that's the 615 issue that the Court has previously raised. 

THE COURT:  All right.</P>



<P>MS. BEHENNA:  That was provided for in 1990, long 

before the antiterrorism bill that was the subject of Section 

235.</P>



<P>The interest that Congress has in providing for rights 

of victims was well recognized.  Under an equal protection 

challenge, your Honor, the Court must determine, if in fact, it 

finds the defendants are part of a suspect group or that 

Section 235 of the antiterrorism bill somehow burdens a 

fundamental right of the defendants -- the Court must find that 

there was no legitimate state interest in providing for the 

victims in this case; and I submit to the Court that that is 

not true.</P>



<P>Congress has a substantial interest in providing for 

the victims which began, as I mentioned earlier, in the 1990 

enactment of the Victims Compensation Assistance Act.  That 

interest in providing for the rights of victims was continued 

in the 1996 legislation providing for closed circuit TV for 

victims.  It provides nothing more than expanding this 

courtroom in situations where venue is changed outside a state 

to a distance of more than 350 miles from the district where 

the crime occurred.</P>



<P>As such, your Honor, it no more burdens a fundamental 

right of the defendant, nor does it -- nor is it irrationally 

related to some legitimate Congressional end.  In fact, as I 

mentioned before, in fact, it is rationally related in a 

rationale for the previous enactments that Congress has 

enacted.</P>



<P>With regard to the separation of powers issue, your 

Honor, in Plaut vs. Spendthrift -- I can't even talk -- 

Spendthrift Farms, the Supreme Court specifically identified 

two types of legislation that is -- by Congress that it is an 

unlawful intrusion to the judicial branch.  One of those types 

is where Congress attempts to tell the Court how to rule in a 

case pending before it.  Specifically, the Supreme Court said 

it is unlawful for Congress to try and legislate in an area 

that annuls a final judgment in a pending case.  I submit to 

the Court that there is no final judgment in this case with 

regard to the closed circuit TV issue.</P>



<P>In fact, there is no invasion by the enactment of 

Section 235.  Congress has always reserved the right to be able 

to manage criminal federal trials.  Specifically, they have the 

right to legislate rules of evidence, they have the right to 

legislate sentencing provisions, and so forth. 

The fact that Congress felt it necessary to provide 

for closed circuit TV in this situation is no more than 

managing a criminal trial, which the Congress already has the 

right to do.</P>



<P>The final argument raised by these defendants has to 

do with the broadcast and the prohibition under Rule 53. 

Continuously, the defendants argue that closed circuit 

television is unlawfully intruding into Rule 53 by telling this 

court that it has to provide closed circuit TV after -- in 

violation of Rule 53, which says that cameras in the courtroom. 

Your Honor, I submit to the Court that the private 

broadcasts by closed circuit TV to the victims in Oklahoma City 

do not come to the level of an Estes vs. Texas public broadcast 

of criminal proceedings.  It is to a very limited group for a 

very specific purpose.  There is no violation in this case. 

There is no concern that somehow there will be a public 

broadcast of these proceedings which would interfere with the 

defendants' right to a fair trial.  Such being the case, the 

analysis under the right to a fair trial, I submit to the 

Court, is wanting.</P>



<P>Your Honor, having stated this, Congress does have a 

legitimate interest in providing for the rights of victims to 

be present during criminal proceedings; and noting that there 

is in separation of powers problem because the judicial branch 

or the Congress did not try to impermissibly invade the 

judicial branch, Section 235 does nothing more than extend this 

courtroom to the victims in Oklahoma City, an audience which 

Congress has already determined has a right to be present 

during the criminal proceedings and to view these proceedings. 

Such being the case, your Honor, the constitutional 

challenges raised by the defendants to Section 235 are not 

real, they're not substantial, and they do not weigh this 

statute and make it fail on constitutional grounds. 

Any problems with the implementation of this statute 

regarding how many cameras, how many microphones, where they 

are going to be placed, are all issues that can be decided 

amongst the parties with the Court at sometime in the future. 

If the statute is constitutional on its face, which it is, your 

Honor, the Court must uphold Section 235 and provide closed 

circuit TV for viewing of the victims in Oklahoma City. 

Thank you.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Any rebuttal on this?</P>



<P>MR. TIGAR:  Briefly.  Very briefly.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  All right.</P>



<P>DEFENDANT NICHOLS' REBUTTAL ARGUMENT</P>



<P>ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION</P>



<P>MR. TIGAR:  Very briefly, your Honor.  The argument 

that all the statute does is expand the courtroom is the same 

argument that Mr. Kelley made on behalf of the press:  All he 

wanted to do was expand the courtroom.  The problem is that 

this form of expansion is regarded as significant. 

With respect to the equal protection challenge, if the 

statute's purpose is to protect the rights of victims who would 

have difficulty getting to a trial, then it is seriously under- 

inclusive for equal protection purposes because the only 

criminal trial in the United States that it could possibly 

apply to is this one.  It would be hard to name another one 

that it could actually now or in the future potentially apply 

to.  And it does not apply, which proves its under- 

inclusiveness to intrastate changes of venue, which, as I told 

the Court, could be more than several hundred miles. 

With respect to the Congress' power, we quoted the 

language from United States vs. Klein.  Klein is a case in 

which there was not a final judgment.  There had been a trial 

court judgment.  It was on appeal.  The court said, What is 

this but to prescribe a rule for the decision of a cause in a 

particular case; i.e. in which a judgment tentatively entered 

had not yet become final?</P>



<P>So for all of those reasons, your Honor, we 

respectfully suggest that the statute fails as a constitutional 

matter.</P>

<P>RULING ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Well, on this I'm prepared to rule and do 

so.  And of course, my focus at the moment is simply on whether 

the statute -- Section 235 is invalid on its face.  And my 

ruling is that it is not.</P>



<P>With respect to the particular challenges and my 

reasoning in support of this ultimate conclusion, I think it's 

an overstatement to say, as the Government has just said, that 

the Congress has the power to manage criminal trials.  It 

doesn't.  It has the power to prescribe rules that the courts 

must apply in criminal trials as well as to prescribe 

sentencing and sentencing procedures.</P>



<P>I look at this statute not as requiring television 

broadcasting.  That's not the issue.  What it is in my reading 

is an amendment to Rule 53 and in a sense a proviso or 

exception to the general prohibition of broadcasting contained 

in Rule 53.</P>



<P>Now, is it special legislation?  As of the moment of 

its enactment, obviously, this is the criminal proceeding that 

the Congress had in mind; but it is not, in my judgment, 

restricted to this case and might have applicability in the 

future.  I don't know.</P>



<P>But Congress does have the power to pass the Rules of 

Criminal Procedure as it does to pass rules of evidence. 

Generally speaking, it's done in a cooperative way under the 

Rules Enabling Act with the participation of the advisory 

committees of the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court, and 

then Congress; but this is not the first time that Congress has 

exercised its power without going through those other 

procedures.  It's done so on several occasions with respect to 

rules of evidence and most recently Rule 413, I believe. 

Does it violate the separation of powers?  In my 

judgment, it does not.  This does not constitute, as I 

interpret the statute, an incursion on the judicial power of 

this court, nor does it interfere with the decisional authority 

of this court with respect to adjudication issues that are, of 

course, the responsibility of the trial court. 

So this matter is not a part of the adjudicative 

process.</P>



<P>With respect to whether it constitutes a bill of 

attainder because it impacts particularly on these defendants, 

it doesn't fit the definition of bill of attainder that has 

been made in the Supreme Court and other courts, because this 

is not punishment.  It's referred in the papers here as 

subjecting the defendants to the perils and penalties of 

telecasting, but this is not going to be telecasting in the 

sense of Estes and Chandler.</P>



<P>For the same reason, it's not ex post facto 

legislation because it is not prescribing punishment.  And of 

course, I intend to see that application of the statute in no 

way affects the rights of the defendants in fundamental 

fairness.</P>



<P>That gets us to the fifth and Sixth Amendment 

arguments, due process under the Fifth, the fundamental fair 

trial requirements of the Sixth Amendment; and of course, 

counsel for the accused have presented this possible parade of 

horribles about what can happen at a trial with television 

cameras and microphones and directors and zoom lens and all of 

those kinds of things.</P>



<P>Well, it's not going to be like that.  The statute 

says very clearly -- and this is also one of the reasons why I 

think it doesn't violate separation of powers.  The statute 

specifically provides that the signal shall be under the 

court's control at all times and shall only be transmitted 

subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the court.  And 

in this case, there will be certainly a number of those 

restrictions.</P>



<P>With respect to the Court's burden to determine who 

views or who has the opportunity to view the television 

transmission, that is, of course, something that has to be 

decided; and the parties have the right to participate in that 

process.</P>



<P>Now, the Congressional purpose has the recitation that 

this is for victims, but the statute doesn't speak to victims. 

It says such persons the Court determines have a compelling 

interest in doing so and are otherwise unable to do so by 

reason of the inconvenience and expense caused by the change of 

convenience.  So compelling purpose is not limited to victims 

or survivors.  That's something that needs interpretation.  And 

we'll be doing that.</P>



<P>Reception of the signal is to be limited here.  And 

the Government in its motion has suggested that it be to a 

courtroom configured as a courtroom and subject to monitoring 

and controls of a courtroom in the receiving place, just as 

with the transmission place, the place of trial.  And that is 

what I'm suggesting.</P>



<P>What is the effect on the transmitting court, this 

courtroom?  Well, I can tell you that we're -- what I have in 

mind.  There would be no visible television camera.  A camera 

can be placed in the wall with a port that is not obtrusive; 

and also, we don't need a director, a program director because 

what the statute speaks to, in my judgment, is to give the 

persons at the remote place -- that is, the receiving place -- 

the same opportunity to see the trial proceedings as the 

persons who are present in the courtroom where the trial 

proceedings are taking place.  And that, to me, means that they 

ought to have something that is the equivalent of a person 

seated here in the courtroom in the public area.  So to my 

mind, that means a fixed focus, a panoramic view, if you will, 

a view of the well of the court, not the jury, probably, and 

no -- no movement of the camera, no focusing on speakers or 

witnesses or anybody else.  You see the whole scene.  That's 

what I call panoramic view.  I don't know what the people in 

the business might call it.</P>



<P>With respect to what impact this might have, the 

awareness that this television signal transmission is taking 

place and it's being viewed by someone else, of course, with 

respect to a jury, it would be a subject of voir dire inquiry 

as to whether persons who are being considered for service on 

this jury would be influenced by that fact.  That can be taken 

care of in voir dire.</P>



<P>With respect to its influence on the Court, I'll pass 

on that.  I don't believe that's a problem. 

With respect to its influence on witnesses and other 

participants, counsel, as suggested in some of the papers filed 

here, well, it isn't going to be any surprise to anybody 

participating in this trial that the proceedings going on here 

are receiving and will receive public attention; so I don't 

think that there is anything in the possibility -- in the 

awareness that some people over in Oklahoma City might be 

viewing this that's going to affect in any significant way the 

conduct of the proceedings and the participants in it. 

On the equal protection arguments that have been made, 

I think there is a legitimate Governmental purpose in providing 

for an opportunity for those who have compelling reasons to 

have this very limited opportunity to see the trial 

proceedings -- see and hear, I presume.</P>



<P>And I don't see here any burden on any fundamental 

right in the case, particularly in view of the controls that I 

intend to exercise.</P>



<P>And I don't see that there is a suspect class or any 

invidious discriminatory purpose or any of those things that 

are customary in looking at an equal protection analysis; so we 

have a rational government purpose being served here. 

Other issues that have been suggested here:  A 

conflict with Rule 615.  Rule 615 will be applicable in the 

receiving courtroom in the same fashion as in the trial 

courtroom itself.  I don't intend for persons to view this who 

are also going to be witnesses in the case; so it will apply 

there as here.</P>



<P>The argument that it doesn't apply by its own terms 

because the state line of Colorado is within 300 miles of 

Oklahoma City -- I'm not persuaded by that argument. 

And the argument also that Lawton is the place, not 

Oklahoma City, because the trial was never scheduled for 

Oklahoma City -- well, of course, the designation of Lawton was 

made at one time by Judge Alley, who found that the place of 

trial should be moved, found sua sponte, I guess, under Rule 18 

that it should be moved because the selection of a jury in 

Oklahoma City would be, I think he said, chancy.  So the -- the 

place in which this trial would be conducted, all other things 

being equal, would have been Oklahoma City; and I believe the 

statute should be interpreted to mean just that; that the 

transmission would be to Oklahoma City.</P>



<P>Now, there are a lot of problems, given what I've said 

about the terms and conditions and subject to control.  These 

problems may be insurmountable.  It has been suggested that 

they are.  We have here the affidavit of this Dr. Welch from 

southern California, University of Southern California, about 

those problems.  Well, we will take a look at that; and I think 

that's something we have to hold a hearing on. 

It is suggested that it is not possible technically to 

make it so that this signal cannot be intercepted.  I don't 

know whether that's true or not true.  We'll have to find out; 

and so we need a hearing really on who is going to view it, how 

we're going to determine that, what monitoring must take place, 

what controls must take place.  Certainly, there will be limits 

on the numbers of people.  I'm aware, having been there, of 

some of the courtrooms in Oklahoma City.  And of course, we'll 

be using a courtroom, not an arena; and the seating facility -- 

the seating capacity there will be limited.  And who is in the 

courtroom representing this court is something to be 

considered, because I guess as it is an extension of the trial 

proceeding, so it is an extension of my authority. 

The fact that we start and if in the course of the 

proceedings trouble arises, I'll know what to do.  The one 

control that certainly is going to be required as a technical 

control is an off switch within the reach of this arm, or this 

arm, because I believe that the trial judge has to have the 

capacity to stop the transmission at any time.  And what we 

also need on the technology, the way I have understood it, is 

some monitoring of how this signal is proceeding so that there 

becomes some immediate awareness if there is a penetration and 

a pirating, if those are the words, of the signal.  You may not 

be able to prevent that from happening, but you can become 

aware when it does happen and then exercise the authority to 

stop it.</P>



<P>So the ruling is that the statute is not 

unconstitutional on its face.  We'll have to work it out. 

Now, that leaves us with the need to conduct that type 

of a hearing at some convenient time.  We have other matters 

that will have to be set as well in addition to what we already 

have set on the severance and a motion to be filed; and we, of 

course, have the whole matter of the laboratory and the 

forensic evidence.  I don't know.</P>



<P>I know, Ms. Wilkinson, that you're the one who has 

previously addressed that, and I presume have been following 

it.</P>



<P>Have you any update on your report with respect to 

that?</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  I do, your Honor.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Please tell us.</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  I believe you asked the Government to 

check with the Inspector General's office to determine if they 

could tell us when they would have the report ready and if they 

could not give us a date for the entire report, whether it 

would be possible to extract certain portions which would be 

relevant to this case.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  That was my request.</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  We did that and heard from the 

Inspector General's Office that they do not have a date certain 

when they will complete the report.</P>



<P>Their best estimate -- they gave us two different 

dates in November and December that they would complete the 

report.  I believe that goes to the issue that the Court raised 

the last time I spoke about this issue, and that is that they 

have a much broader charter to investigate than this court is 

considering in this case.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Yes.</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  That being said, I thought it might 

help if I tell the Court briefly about some of the thing that 

they're looking into that don't involve this case directly. 

For example, they're investigating lots of other cases, as 

Mr. Jones brought to your attention, United States vs. Moody, 

which was the killing of the federal judge down in Georgia. 

They're looking into that case and other specific cases. 

But in addition to those other cases that don't 

involve United States vs. McVeigh and Jones, they're also 

looking at the general protocol, procedures -- I'm sorry -- did 

I say Mr. Jones?</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Yes.</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  Freudian slip.</P>



<P>MR. JONES:  I take it I'm no longer free to go. 

THE COURT:  Do you want a lawyer?</P>



<P>MR. TIGAR:  Could we have judicial notice of what's 

just been said here?</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  I apologize, Mr. Jones.</P>



<P>The other thing is the Inspector General is looking 

into are the procedures, the protocol and the management of the 

laboratory in general and I believe -- although, again, we are 

not privy to their final conclusions because they haven't made 

any -- they're going to make recommendations in the report 

about management of the FBI laboratory as a whole. 

That being said, I believe the best way for us to 

proceed is to schedule the hearings.  And I say that for two 

reasons.  One is because we have provided the underlying data 

that the Inspector General is using in his conclusions; that 

is, the investigate -- the investigatory reports.  And we are 

in the process of providing transcripts when they were taken or 

when they were recorded, when the interviews were recorded, to 

the defense, that apply in this case.</P>



<P>We also are working with the criminal division, which 

is the portion of the department that has direct contact with 

the Inspector General's office in terms of the Whitehurst 

investigation; and we are also receiving any expert reports 

written by the Inspector General's outside panel of experts in 

connection with this case or in connection with conduct of 

examiners as it relates to this case.</P>



<P>Based on that information and our continuing 

obligation that we understand to provide that type of 

information to the defendants, they will have access to the 

same raw data that the Inspector General will in attacking our 

experts.</P>



<P>That is important because we believe that is the 

ammunition that the defense will need to challenge the 

credibility of the experts and challenge the evidence itself 

that we would like to introduce.</P>



<P>The report, the conclusions that the Inspector General 

makes, would not, we believe, be admissible in this courtroom, 

especially in the preliminary 703 hearings where the Court is 

making a determination whether this -- each specific expert 

that the defense challenges is admissible for the jury.  Again, 

you're not going to make a determination as to the weight of 

the evidence.  It's just as to whether this expert is truly 

qualified to make the determination that we ask the Court to 

introduce.</P>



<P>So for those reasons, we don't believe that the Court 

should wait for the report nor that the defense needs that 

report to fairly and thoroughly attack the Government's experts 

or challenge their credibility or their expertise. 

Another reason, your Honor, why we believe we don't 

need to wait for the report is over the past year, we have been 

providing the laboratory reports to the defense counsel.  They 

know in large part who our experts are from the FBI laboratory, 

to ensure that they know all of the experts that we're going to 

introduce and all of the conclusions that we currently intend 

to introduce.  And, of course, we would always inform the 

parties and the Court that we reserve the right to introduce 

additional expert testimony.  Depending on the challenge of the 

defense and depending on the -- how our experts testify at 

trial and how the evidence develops, we will provide the Rule 

16 material to the defense which would outline each expert's 

credentials and outline the general findings that we intend to 

affirmatively introduce in court.  We will reference the 

laboratory reports that they have so that they'll be able to 

easily go back and check that they have the reports and they 

have the underlying facts that the expert will testify to. 

We told the Court several weeks ago that we would do 

that by August 30.  We have reevaluated.  And if the Court is 

willing to schedule the hearings at an earlier date, we are 

willing to provide that material by -- August 2 is the earliest 

date we think we could possibly do it for the defense.  And if 

the defense needs several weeks to evaluate that to make the 

challenges, they could do that during the month of August. 

We believe again, your Honor, that they have had most 

of this material for quite some time.  It's not as if we have 

not turned over the lab reports throughout the case.  They know 

what the major findings are that we intend to introduce. 

However, for them to properly evaluate it, we would 

recommend that they would have three weeks in August to review 

those materials, the Rule 16 material.  Then they would give us 

their challenges.  We are not sure at this point whether 

they're going to challenge every single expert that the 

Government intends to introduce.  As I mentioned before, there 

is a fingerprint expert.  I can't imagine under Daubert that 

they would challenge the reliability of fingerprint testimony 

and I can't imagine that they would challenge the fingerprint 

experts in this case based on the Whitehurst materials because 

there are no challenges to the fingerprints section in the 

laboratory.</P>



<P>And there may be reasons, your Honor, that the defense 

does not want to, for tactical reasons, challenge other experts 

in a preliminary hearing because they may believe they have 

some --</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Yes.</P>



<P>MS. WILKINSON:  -- advantage.</P>



<P>We would ask that the Court then schedule the 

hearings, giving us just two weeks once we receive the 

defense's challenges; and we would present all the experts that 

the defense challenges and try and establish their expertise 

and credibility.</P>



<P>MR. JONES:  May I respond?</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Yes.</P>



<P>MR. JONES:  Ms. Wilkinson's suggestion is unacceptable 

for the defense, and it represents an attempt to rush to 

judgment on the weakest part of their case, which is the 

forensic evidence.</P>



<P>I want to go down each one of those points she's made. 

The reason they want to rush to this hearing is because the 

more we investigate, the more we find out, notwithstanding the 

tremendous obstacles placed in our path, the more we know that 

the FBI forensic laboratory as it relates to the important 

point in this case is the emperor's new clothes.  First of all, 

there isn't any reason to wait till August 2 to give us 

anything.  We have asked for this material from the FBI 

laboratory since November of last year, specific motions served 

on them, which they have never responded to. 

They give us lab reports in which the person that did 

the work is not known to us until, finally, we insisted that we 

be given some kind of explanation who this person or persons 

is.  It contains absolutely no quantitative data, which is 

absolutely essential to determine the credibility.  There is 

nothing provided to us that relates to the contamination of the 

laboratory.  We have no protocols.  We don't know how the 

laboratory does this or that.  And we will shortly, thanks to 

the Court's granting certain 848 -- we know a little bit more 

about what they've been doing than we knew three weeks ago. 

And we are preparing a detailed Rule 16 motion to the 

Court to get it all, because our experts, who include some of 

the world's most famous, well-recognized law enforcement 

people, who are familiar with the laboratory, far more familiar 

than I am, have told us how it operates and what we're entitled 

to see in order to properly defend our client. 

And they will sign affidavits and if necessary come to 

this court and tell you why we need that material.  What they 

want to give us is the tip of the iceberg. 

For example, these transcripts, which they say they 

can give us August 2, they have now.  They've had for months. 

We have asked for them for months.</P>



<P>What we have received are small snippets which the 

Court has under seal relating only to this case.  And they 

said, Well, the Moody case doesn't relate to this case.  Of 

course the Moody case relates to this case.  If nothing else, 

it relates on the basis of contamination, because that is one 

of the central criticisms that has been made under seal with 

this investigation.  They don't want us to get a copy of the 

report of the five experts or the Inspector General, because 

the report is going to be devastating to their position.  They 

want to single out that part of it and give it to us. 

Now, the Court may say that's all we have to get; but 

what we want to have the opportunity to do is to tell the Court 

and in an adversarial proceeding, if necessary, why we are 

entitled to more than what is being offered.  I represent to 

the Court, having spent two weeks flying various places, that 

what they're willing to give us isn't going to get the job done 

and is a carefully controlled selection so that we can't get at 

the heart of it; that this forensic heart does not inculpate 

our client.</P>



<P>And that's just one of the discovery problems.  We are 

still negotiating with the Government.  Two weeks ago we gave 

them a 50-page letter -- I say two weeks ago, perhaps two and a 

half weeks ago -- so that we don't burden the Court with that; 

but this question of the FBI laboratory is critical to the 

defense.  And in view of the extraordinary investigation, in 

fact, unprecedented investigation going on in the lab in which 

you have to bring in outside experts and the Inspector General, 

it seems to me that that part is exculpatory.  We're entitled 

to it.  It's the cornerstone of our defense, your Honor. 

And most importantly, Ms. Wilkinson and some FBI 

agents went not too long ago to interview General Bernard 

Parton.  General Parton is a retired general of the United 

States Army who has written a rather significant report 

challenging the basic thesis of the Government's case.  He's 

not our expert.  They went to interview him.  We haven't been 

able to interview a single FBI agent in that lab despite 

repeated written requests.</P>



<P>I think at the appropriate time we're going to ask the 

Court -- and in fact, I invite the Court to issue the order 

today -- that we be permitted to interview Frederic Whitehurst 

forthwith, James Colby forthwith, and every one of those other 

FBI agents that are involved in that investigation to find out 

what they know about contamination of the lab as it relates to 

this case and the works of Martz and Thurman.  There is no 

reason why we can't interview those people, and they have 

prohibited us from doing so; and yet they come before the Court 

and say we're going to give them everything they need. 

Well, fine.  We want to interview Special Agent 

Whitehurst and these other nine agents.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar?</P>



<P>MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I don't understand the 

Government's offer.  If the Government has a proffer of expert 

testimony to make, it should make it.  When it has made it, we 

will be in a position to tell the Court within a very few days 

how much time we reasonably need to respond to it and to 

prepare for a hearing.</P>



<P>Ms. Wilkinson's fundamental premise with which she 

began is completely in error.  The report of the Inspector 

General with respect to the Whitehurst matter under Federal 

Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c) would be admissible if we offered it 

but not if the Government offered it.  It is a report prepared 

under lawful authority, factual findings resulting from an 

investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law. 

The Government can't introduce it, but we can in a 

criminal case.  So I fail to see how that could be irrelevant 

to us.</P>



<P>We may very well ask the Court when we see this to 

wait until that report is available; but I can't tell you right 

now.</P>



<P>Another example:  At the last hearing, Ms. Wilkinson 

said that the Government had retained an entomologist, and I 

thought the only bugs in the case were ones on people's 

telephones.  But Mr. Nigh wrote and found out that the 

entomologist is examining crank case drippings at the Geary 

State Fishing Lake and their impact on insect colonies there, 

and that will help them to date things.  I don't know how long 

it will take us to find somebody who is equally enthusiastic 

about insects or even if the Government intends to introduce 

its entomologist.</P>



<P>I would suggest if the Government has its proffer that 

it present it; that within a week from that time, we will tell 

the Court how much time we reasonably need to get ready for a 

hearing.</P>



<P>I will say to the Court that the American Bar 

Association meeting is the first week in August.  I don't know 

if the Court intends to be there.  I've been invited to give a 

talk there, and I intend to do it.</P>



<P>THE COURT:  I don't intend to be there, for your talk 

or any other.</P>



<P>MR. TIGAR:  I understand that, your Honor; and I 

wanted to warn you just in case you were thinking of going 

there.  But it's in Orlando; and my daughter voted that I go 

there, and so therefore there will be two Mickey Mouse events, 

my talk and then our visit.</P>



<P>And then if the Court please, unless the Department of 

Defense decides to enforce the don't-ask/don't-tell policy, I 

have a general court marshal for Major Deborah Meeks that 

starts the 12th of August, a pro bono case; and I can't escape 

that obligation.  But we can get to your Honor promptly some 

report on when we'd be ready for a hearing, which will be with 

all the speed we can muster.</P>



<P>But I think the first thing Ms. Wilkinson has to do is 

to stop describing what they're going to do and then do it, and 

then we'll see what our response should be. 

THE COURT:  Well, actually, there are some other 

things that I want to deal with with counsel on scheduling. 

Now, I'm going to do that in chambers.  It's not, Mr. Kelley, a 

part of the adjudicative process.  It is by way of doing some 

things with respect to planning and scheduling that I think 

legitimately are not public at this time. </P>

<P>STEPHEN E. HAGEN, et al., individually, as private attorneys general, and

<P>Defendants.</P>

<P>No. 971047</P>

<P>Class Action</P>

<P>STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT</P></B>


<P>This Stipulation of Settlement and Exhibits (the "Stipulation") is made by
and among individual and representative plaintiffs Stephen Anderson, Todd
Bandrowsky, John Przygoda, Steven Craig Smith, Paul Boni, Frederick J.
DiMarco, David L. Feige, First M. Corp., Fred Glick, Stephen E. Hagen, Marc
L. Hoffman, Craig Smith, Kenneth Crystal, and Heather Buchfirer
(collectively, the "Plaintiffs"), on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of
the Settlement Class as defined herein, on the one hand, and defendant
America Online, Inc. ("America Online"), a Delaware corporation, on the
other hand, by and through their respective counsel. </P>


<P><H3>I. BACKGROUND</H3></P>

<P>A. On July 14, 1995, Stephen Hagen commenced the action entitled Stephen
Hagen v. America Online. Inc., Superior Court of California, City and
County of San Francisco, Case No. 971047, which included allegations
regarding the charges for and disclosures about America Online services, as
more fully set forth below; </P>

<P>B. After July 14, 1995, the following additional actions were filed against
America Online making similar allegations (collectively, the "Actions"):
Stephen Anderson v. America Online, Inc., Superior Court of California,
County of San Diego, No. 693803; Todd Bandrowsky, John Przygoda, and
Stephen Craig Smith v. America Online. Inc., Superior Court of New Jersey,
Law Division, Burlington County No. L-2441-95; Paul Boni v. America Online,
Inc., Superior Court of Delaware, New Castle County, No. 95C-07-142;
Kenneth Crystal and Heather Buchfirer v. America Online. Inc., Superior
Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk Division No. 95-8095B; Frederick J. DiMarco
v. America Online, Inc., Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County
No. Bur-L-2439-95; David L. Feige v. America Online, Inc., Supreme Court of
New York, New York County, No. 95-118333; First M. Corp. v. America Online.
Inc., Chancery Court of Delaware, New Castle County, No. 14476; Glick v.
America Online, Inc., Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia
County, Civil Division, No. 95-10-0074; Marc L. Hoffman v. America Online.
Inc., Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Civil
Division, No. 95-08-SD-0076; and Craig Smith v. America Online. Inc.,
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Civil Division,
No. 95-08-SD-0059. The Actions assert, inter alia, purported claims against
America Online for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, breach
of contract, unjust enrichment, and alleged violations of state consumer
protection and consumer fraud statutes. </P>

<P>C. In connection with settlement, the Plaintiffs are filing an Amended
Complaint in the Hagen Action, on behalf of all of the Plaintiffs, in the
form attached as Exhibit 8 to this Stipulation (the "Amended Complaint"),
including allegations that America Online did not adequately disclose its
policies of adding a fifteen-second connection and disconnection time to
the length of each session for billing purposes, and of billing customers
in one-minute increments rounded up to the nearest minute; that America
Online's billing methods and practices caused subscribers to incur
additional charges for downloading of image files, for delays in connection
time caused by America Online software, and for time spent in "free" areas;
that America Online failed to refund unused membership charges to customers
who cancel their subscriptions prior to the end of a billing period; that
customers who canceled their subscriptions near the end of a billing period
were erroneously charged for an additional monthly fee; that America
Online's billing system unfairly calculated service charges on a
per-session basis; that America Online made withdrawals from customers'
checking accounts without proper authorization; and that America Online's
advertising of its hourly rate as $2.95 per hour was misleading
(collectively, the "Claims"). As used throughout this stipulation, the
"Hagen Action" shall refer to the Hagen Action, including the Amended
Complaint. </P>

<P>D. Plaintiffs have engaged in an investigation of the claims underlying the
Actions, including reviews of America Online documents, and interviews with
representatives, officers, and employees of America Online. Plaintiffs'
counsel's investigation was conducted with the assistance of technical
experts to assist them in their investigation of America Online practices. </P>

<P>E. In March 1996, pursuant to an understanding reached by the parties,
America Online made certain changes to its online disclosures, which
addressed a number of the allegations raised in the Actions. </P>

<P>F. On April 4, 1996, the Hagen Action was assigned to Plan 3, and on April
17, 1996, Judge A. James Robertson, II was appointed as Plan 3 Judge. </P>

<P>G. On May 7, 1996 and on June 7, 1996, counsel for the parties in the Hagen
Action met with Judge Robertson at informal status conferences. </P>

<P>H. Plaintiffs have now completed their investigation, and the parties have
reached an agreement on the terms of the settlement set out in this
Stipulation. </P>

<P>I. Plaintiffs' counsel have examined the benefits to be obtained under the
terms of the proposed Settlement and have considered the costs, risks and
delays associated with the continued prosecution of this litigation and the
likely appeals of any rulings. Plaintiffs' counsel believe that, in
consideration of all the circumstances and after prolonged and serious
arms' length negotiations with America Online, the proposed Settlement
embodied in this Stipulation is fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best
interest of all members of the Settlement Class, as defined below. </P>

<P>J. America Online vigorously denies all liability with respect to any and
all of the facts or Claims alleged in the Actions, denies that its billing
practices or any of its actions were at any time unlawful, unfair, or
fraudulent, denies that it breached any contract, generally denies that it
engaged in any wrongdoing, and contends that it has agreed to the
settlement embodied in this Stipulation and Exhibits thereto (the
"Settlement") in order to avoid needless litigation costs and disruption.
While America Online vigorously denies the allegations of the Amended
Complaint, America Online acknowledges that the terms and conditions of the
Settlement were agreed to as a result of the efforts of Plaintiffs and
their counsel after extensive negotiations between the parties. The parties
agree that certain of the consideration to be approved as part of this
Stipulation has either already been implemented or will be implemented
before the Effective Date, as defined below, because of the need for
providing prompt and expeditious relief to members of the Settlement Class
and the general public. </P>

<P>NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the parties, through
their respective counsel, that the Actions be dismissed with prejudice,
settled or compromised as applicable on the terms set forth herein, as
between Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class Members, as defined below, and
America Online, upon approval of the Court in the Hagen Action after
hearing as provided for in this Stipulation, all on the following terms and

<P>B. Approving the form of the Notice to the Settlement Class (the "Notice")

of Dismissal dismissing the Hagen Action on the merits and with prejudice; </P>

<P>E. Finding that the notice to be given in accordance with the Settlement
Hearing and Notice Order constitutes the best notice practicable under the
circumstances and constitutes valid, due and sufficient notice to all
members of the Settlement Class, complying fully with the requirements of
Section 382 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California
Constitution and the Constitution of the United States, and any other
applicable law; </P>

<P>F. Scheduling a hearing (the "Final Settlement Hearing") to be held by the
Court in the Hagen Action to consider and determine whether the proposed
Settlement under the terms of this Stipulation should be approved as fair,
reasonable and adequate, and whether a judgment approving the Settlement
and dismissing the Hagen Action on the merits and with prejudice, against
Plaintiffs and Settlement Class Members, should be entered, and to consider
Plaintiffs' request for payment of attorney's fees and reimbursement of
expenses; </P>

<P>G. Providing that the Final Settlement Hearing may, from time to time and
without further notice to the Settlement Class, be continued or adjourned
by order of the Court; and </P>

<P>H. Providing that objections by any Settlement Class Member to the proposed
Settlement or the payment of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses
to Plaintiffs' counsel, shall be heard and any papers submitted in support
of said objections shall be considered by the Court at the Final Settlement
Hearing only if, on or before a date to specified in the Settlement Notice
and Hearing Order, such objector files with the Court a written notice of
his, her or its intention to appear, submits documentary proof that he, she
or it is a member of the Settlement Class, states the basis for the
objections, and serves copies of the foregoing papers and all other papers
in support of objections upon counsel for the parties, as directed by the

received by designated counsel by the deadline set by the Court in the
Settlement Notice and Hearing Order. </P>


<P><H3>V.  AMERICA ONLINE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SETTLEMENT</H3> </P>

<P>In consideration for the agreement to resolve and have judgment entered in
the Hagen Action and to dismiss all of the Actions other than the Hagen
Action under the terms of this Stipulation, and to entry of the Final
Judgment and Orders of Dismissal in all of the Actions, releasing all
Released Claims against the Released Parties, and after providing notice to
the Settlement Class in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Notice
and Hearing Order and holding a Final Settlement Hearing, America Online,
on behalf of the Defendants, agrees to the following: </P>

<P>A. Disclosures: Except as provided below in V(A)(2)(iii), V(A)(3)(i) and
V(A)(3)(iii), commencing upon execution of this stipulation by all
Plaintiffs' counsel and for a period ending no earlier than one year after
the Effective Date, America Online will make available the following
information as part of America Online's online service: </P>

<P>1. Additional Billing Disclosures: America Online will provide general
information relating to its billing practices, together with disclosures in
its Terms of Service Agreement, in a manner substantially as provided in
Exhibit 3 hereto. </P>

<P>2. Rounding Up: So long as America Online maintains its practice of
charging subscribers in one minute increments by rounding up the online
time for each session to the nearest whole minute: (i) America Online will
include in the information provided in its online billing information
screens a disclosure that the subscriber will be charged in one-minute
increments by rounding up the length of each session to the nearest whole
minute, in a manner substantially as provided in Exhibit 3 hereto; (ii)
America Online will include a disclosure as part of the clock screen that
can be accessed during an America Online session (the "Online Clock")
indicating that the online time is an estimate only, and that the
subscriber should see keyword Billing for billing policies, in a manner
substantially as provided in Exhibit 3 hereto; and (iii) America Online
shall, commencing two weeks after this Stipulation is executed by all of
the parties hereto, include a message at the end of a session (the "End of
Session Message") which indicates the subscriber's total billed time online
for the session after rounding up to the nearest whole minute. </P>

<P>3. Connection/Disconnection Time: So long as America Online maintains its
practice of adding to the subscriber's total time online fifteen-seconds or
some other amount of time as a charge for connection/disconnection: (i)
America Online shall, commencing two weeks after this Stipulation is
executed by the parties hereto, include in the information provided in its
online billing information screens a disclosure that the length of each
session will include the additional time charged, in a manner substantially
as provided in Exhibit 3 hereto; (ii) America Online will include a
disclosure as part of the Online Clock indicating that the online time is
an estimate only, and that the subscriber should see keyword Billing for
billing policies, in a manner substantially as provided in Exhibit 3
hereto; and (iii) America Online shall, commencing two weeks after this
Stipulation is executed by all of the parties hereto, include an End of
Session Message which indicates the subscriber's total billed time online
for the session after adding any amount of time as a charge for
connection/disconnection. </P>

<P>4. Cancellation of Accounts: So long as America Online maintains its
current practice of canceling subscriber's accounts within a reasonable
time after receipt of a request for cancellation, America Online's online
information will include a disclosure, in a manner substantially as
provided in Exhibit 3 hereto, that (1) if a subscriber decides to cancel
his or her account, America Online will cancel the account within a
reasonable time after receipt of the notification of termination; (2) the
subscriber has already been billed for service through the end of the
current billing month, and such amount will not be refunded; (3) a
subscriber who cancels within the last 72 hours of a billing month may be
erroneously charged an additional monthly fee; and (4) if the subscriber
has a problem with termination of the account, has been erroneously billed,
or wishes to handle termination by telephone, he or she may call a 1-800
telephone number, to be provided by America Online, for assistance. America
Online will include in the materials used to train its telephone
representatives an instruction that subscribers who call to cancel their
account at a time when America Online cannot immediately process the
request for cancellation should be informed that America Online will
process the request within a reasonable time, and that the subscriber
should check to ensure that the cancellation was processed properly. </P>

<P>5. Current Bill Summary: During the first session of a subscriber's billing
month, the Current Bill Summary available as part of America Online's
service will indicate that this is the first session of a new billing
period and that only in subsequent sessions can the subscriber view the
Current Bill Summary screen to see the amount of unused time remaining in
the billing month, in a manner substantially as provided in Exhibit 3
hereto. America Online will include in the information provided in the
"Explain Billing Terms" screen a disclosure that its billing period ends at
10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the last day of the billing period. </P>

<P>B. Current Users: During the period beginning on the Effective Date and
ending 30 days after the Effective Date: </P>

<P>1. America Online will credit the accounts of Settlement Class Members who
have open America Online accounts at the time of crediting ("Current
Users") with one hour of additional free time (in addition to the time
included in the monthly minimum service charge), to be used within a
four-month period after such time is credited to each subscriber. </P>

<P>2. America Online will credit 1.36 million free hours to the accounts of
Current Users who, based on America Online's computerized records as of May
5, 1996 ("the Database"), qualify as Heavy Users, to be used within a
four-month period after such time is credited to each subscriber. The
amount of free time credited to each such Current User's account will be
determined according to the formula described in Exhibit 4. </P>

<P>C. Former Users: Following the Effective Date, America Online will provide
to Settlement Class Members who are not Current Users ("Former Users") as
follows: </P>

<P>1. America Online will pay up to $500,000 in cash for claims made by Former
Users who submit, pursuant to paragraph V(C)(3), below, Proofs of Claim
verifying that each is a Heavy User. The amount to be paid by America
Online to each such claimant will be determined based on the formula
described in Exhibit 5. In the event the total dollar amount of all valid
claims exceeds $500,000, the claims will be prorated so that the total
amount paid by America Online for all claims equals $500,000. In the event
the total dollar amount of all valid claims is less than $500,000, the
remainder will be used to pay for the review provided in paragraph VI(C),
below. In the event that the total amount of all valid claims plus the cost
for such review is less than $500,000, the remainder will be paid to
consumer-oriented charitable organizations engaged in issues involving the
online and Internet media, subject to Plaintiffs' consent, which will not
unreasonably be withheld. </P>

<P>2. Former Users who are not Heavy Users or who do not wish to make a claim
under paragraph V(C)(I), above, and who re-subscribe within four months
after the Effective Date, shall, upon request and affirmation that they
were subscribers of America Online Services during the Class Period, have
each of their accounts credited, upon re-subscription, with an additional
one hour of free time (in addition to the time provided to such individuals
for re-subscribing) to be used within the first four months after
re-subscription. Nothing in this agreement requires any change by America
Online in its standards for re-subscription. </P>

<P>3. Each Settlement Class Member who is a Former User and who wishes to
participate in the Settlement shall submit to America Online a Proof of
Claim substantially in the form of Exhibit 6 hereto, according to the
procedures set out in Exhibit 6 hereto. To be valid, a Proof of Claim must
be: (1) completed in a manner that permits America Online to determine that
the claimant is a Former User and is otherwise eligible to make a claim;
(2) signed with an affirmation that the information provided is true and
correct; and (3) postmarked for delivery to America Online no later than
the date set forth in the Settlement Notice and Hearing Order. </P>

<P>D. The disclosures, distributions, and other consideration described in
paragraphs V and VI, and the attorneys' fees and expenses described in
paragraph IX, are the only consideration America Online shall give on
behalf of the Defendants, in connection with this Settlement. </P>


<P><H3>VI. NOTICE AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS</H3></P>

<P>A. America Online shall be responsible for providing notice to the
Settlement Class, in the manner set forth in the Settlement Notice and
Hearing Order. America Online shall pay all costs for providing such
notice. </P>

<P>B. America Online shall be responsible for the administrative costs which
arise from the following: </P>

<P>1. Distributing Proof of Claim forms to Settlement Class Members who
request them; </P>

<P>2. Obtaining and maintaining a post office box for the receipt of Proofs of
Claim; </P>

<P>3. Maintaining custody of all Proofs of Claim and the envelopes in which
they were sent; </P>

<P>4. Calculating, based on the Proofs of Claim submitted, the total amount of
all valid claims; </P>

<P>5. Calculating, pursuant to paragraph V(C)(I), the amount to be paid to
each claimant who submits a valid claim; </P>

<P>6. Distributing checks to each claimant who submits a valid claim; and </P>

<P>7. Providing a 1-800 telephone number to respond to requests by Class
Members regarding Proofs of Claim and/or other similar administrative
matters. </P>

<P>C. A large-sized national accounting firm which does not provide services
to America Online and who is agreeable to the parties, shall review the
administrative tasks referred to in paragraph VI(B) and the crediting of
free time to Current Users referred to in V(B) to reasonably assure that
these benefits have been properly completed. America Online will pay up to
$50,000 for the cost of said review provided, however, if the reasonable
costs of such review were to exceed $50,000, America Online will pay
subject to Court order, up to an additional $25,000 for such review. </P>


<P><H3>VII. THE FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDERS OF DISMISSAL</H3> </P>

<P>A. Upon the preliminary approval of this settlement by the Court in the
Hagen Action by entry of an order substantially in the form of Exhibit I
hereto, all discovery and other proceedings in the Hagen Action shall be
stayed until further order of the Court, except such proceedings as may be
necessary to implement the settlement or comply with or effectuate the
terms of this Stipulation. </P>

<P>B. As soon as practicable after execution of this Stipulation, Plaintiffs
in each of the Actions other than the Hagen Action (the "Other Actions")
shall stipulate to the entry and submit to each of the courts in which the
Other Actions are pending an order dismissing with prejudice all claims
against the Defendants, subject to final non-appealable approval of the
Settlement. Each order of dismissal shall provide for the dismissal of each
action without costs being awarded to either party. If court approval is
necessary to dismiss any of the Other Actions, Plaintiffs' counsel shall
use their best efforts to obtain such an order on the grounds that such
actions are being resolved as part of the Settlement set forth in this
Stipulation. Plaintiffs in all of the Actions agree not to request
exclusion from the Settlement Class. Upon the final approval of this
Stipulation and the settlement set forth herein by the Court in the Hagen
Action the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 2 shall be entered providing for the dismissal
with prejudice and the release by Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class of
all Released Claims against all Released Parties. </P>


<P><H3>VIII. RELEASES</H3></P>

<P>A. Upon the Effective Date, the Plaintiffs, for themselves and as
representatives of the Settlement Class, and on behalf of each Settlement
Class Member and their respective agents, successors, heirs, or assigns,
shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Final Judgment and Order
of Dismissal in the Hagen Action, shall have fully, finally, and forever
released, relinquished and discharged all Released Claims against the
Released Parties. </P>

<P>B. Upon the Effective Date, the Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on
behalf of all Settlement Class Members, represent and acknowledge that they
fully understand that if any fact relating to any matter covered by this
Stipulation is found hereafter to be other than or different from the facts
now believed by any of them to be true, that each of them expressly accepts
and assumes the risk of such possible differences in fact and agrees that
this Stipulation shall nevertheless remain in effect, and that each such
person expressly waives all of the rights and benefits of Section 1542 of
the California Civil Code, which reads as follows: </P>


<P>"Section 1542. Certain Claims Not Affected by General Release. A general
release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor." </P>


<P>C. Each of the Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class Members, upon the
Effective Date, shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Final
Judgment and Order of Dismissal in the Hagen Action shall have waived any
and all provisions, rights and benefits conferred by Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code or any law of any state or territory of the United
States, or principle of common law, which is similar, comparable or
equivalent to Section 1542 of the California Civil Code. </P>


<P><H3>IX. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND DISBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES</H3> </P>

<P>A. As part of the Settlement, counsel for Plaintiffs and the Settlement
Class request payment for both attorneys' fees and reimbursement of
reasonable expenses in an amount not to exceed $2,750,000. America Online
has agreed not to oppose either in Court or in any public forum the request
for payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses not exceeding $2,750,000.
Within 5 days after the entry by the Court of the Settlement Notice and
Hearing Order, defendant America Online shall transfer $2,750,000 into a
trustee account in the name of Morrison & Foerster ("Trust Fund") with
interest to run from the date the Court approves the fees. Nothing
regarding the Court's decision on the application for attorneys' fees and
expenses shall operate to terminate or cancel this Stipulation or have any
effect on the Final Judgment. </P>

<P>B. Plaintiffs' counsel agree that they will not seek any additional fees or
costs from any of the Defendants. If any application is made to any court
by any other Person for an award of attorneys' fees or expenses with regard
to the settlement or the claims settled thereby, Defendants shall not be
restricted from opposing it. </P>

<P>C. America Online, on behalf of the Defendants, will pay out of said Trust
Fund, within five business days after the Effective Date, the fees and
expenses actually ordered by the Court in the Hagen Action up to the
foregoing maximum amount together with interest on approved fees as
provided in paragraph IX(A). </P>

<P>D. Other than the attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses described
in paragraphs IX(A-C), America Online will have no obligation to pay any
attorneys' fees or reimbursement of expenses to any of the Plaintiffs or
their counsel. </P>


<P><H3>X. DEFENDANTS' DENIAL OF LIABILITY</H3></P>

<P>A.   Defendants have indicated their intent vigorously to contest each and
every claim in the Action. Defendants maintain that they have consistently
acted in accordance with governing laws at all times and further maintain
that there has been no finding of any wrongdoing of any kind on Defendants'
part. Defendants continue vigorously to deny all of the material
allegations in the Amended Complaint, and assert that the Claims are
without merit. Defendants nonetheless have concluded that it is in their
best interest that the Actions be settled on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Stipulation. Defendants claim that they reached that
conclusion after considering the factual and legal issues in the Action,
the substantial benefits of a final resolution of the Action, the expense
that would be necessary to prosecute the Action through trial and through
any appeals that might be taken, the benefits of disposing of protracted
and complex litigation, and the desire of Defendants to conduct their
business unhampered by the distractions of continued litigation. </P>

<P>B. Defendants enter into this Stipulation without in any way acknowledging
any fault, liability, or wrongdoing of any kind. Neither this Stipulation,
nor any of its terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or
proceedings connected with it, shall be construed as an admission or
concession by Defendants of the truth of any of the allegations in any of
the Actions, or of any liability, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind. </P>

<P>C. Neither this Stipulation, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor the
Final Judgment, shall constitute an admission by the Defendants of any
liability of wrongdoing whatsoever, nor is this Stipulation a finding of
the validity or invalidity of any Claims in the Actions or a finding of any
wrongdoing by the Defendants. Neither this Stipulation nor the Final
Judgment shall be used or construed as an admission, concession, or
presumption or inference of any fault, liability or wrongdoing by any
Person. Neither the Final Judgment, this Stipulation, the fact of
settlement and the settlement proceedings, nor the settlement negotiations,
nor any related document, shall be offered or received in evidence as an
admission, concession, or presumption or inference against any party in any
proceeding other than (i) in such proceedings as may be necessary to
consummate or enforce this Stipulation, or (ii) in any subsequent action
against or by the Released Parties, or any of them, to support a defense of
res judicata, collateral estoppel, release, or other theory of claim
preclusion, issue preclusion, or similar defense. </P>


<P><H3>XI. OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT</H3></P>

<P>A. Upon the entry of the Settlement Notice and Hearing Order, the parties
and their undersigned counsel agree to undertake their best efforts to
immediately dismiss, stay or abate all discovery, injunction proceedings
and other proceedings and court deadlines in the Hagen Action and in each
of the other Actions, except such formal or informal proceedings by the
parties in the Hagen Action that may be necessary either to implement this
Settlement or to comply with or effectuate the terms of this Stipulation. </P>

<P>B. Within seven (7) business days after the deadline established by the
Court in the Settlement Notice and Hearing Order for members of the
Settlement Class to request exclusion from the Settlement Class,
Plaintiffs' Counsel shall furnish America Online's counsel with a complete
list of all timely and valid requests for exclusion received by Plaintiffs'
Counsel. Counsel for the parties shall cooperate to the fullest extent
possible to ensure that a complete list of requests for exclusion is
compiled for the Court by the time of the Final Settlement Hearing. </P>

<P>C. In the event that this Settlement Stipulation is not approved by the
Court in its present form, or the conditions required for the settlement to
be consummated do not occur, then the parties hereto, including all
plaintiffs in the Non-California Actions, shall be restored to their
respective positions as of June 20, 1996, the terms and provisions of the
Settlement Stipulation shall have no further force and effect with respect
to the parties and, to the extent permitted by law, shall not be used in
any action or proceeding for any purpose and any orders entered by the
Court in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Stipulation shall be
treated as vacated, nunc pro tune. </P>

<P>D. The parties acknowledge that it is their intent to consummate this
Stipulation and agree to cooperate to the extent necessary to effectuate
and implement all terms and conditions of the Stipulation and to exercise
their best efforts to accomplish the foregoing terms and conditions of the
Stipulation. </P>

<P>E. Plaintiffs and their counsel shall not encourage any third party to
institute any claims or litigation against any party hereto that in any way
relates to any activities or practices that are the same or similar to
those underlying the Actions. </P>

<P>F. All of the exhibits to this Stipulation are material and integral parts
hereof, and are fully incorporated herein by reference. </P>

<P>G. The undersigned counsel represent that they are fully authorized to
execute and enter into the terms and conditions of this Stipulation on
behalf of their respective clients. </P>

<P>H. This Stipulation (along with the exhibits thereto) contains the entire
agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior agreements or
understandings between them. All terms of this Stipulation are contractual
and not mere recitals and shall be construed as if drafted by all parties
hereto. The terms of this Stipulation are and shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto, their agents,
attorneys, employees, heirs, successors, and assigns, and upon all other
persons claiming any interest in the subject matter hereto through any of
the parties hereto, including any Plaintiff or Settlement Class Member.
This Stipulation may be amended or modified only by a written instrument
signed by or on behalf of all parties hereto or their successors in
interest. Amendments and modifications may be made without notice to the
Settlement Class, unless notice is required by the Court. </P>

<P>J. This Stipulation may be executed in counterparts or by fax, with each
counterpart or fax signature having the same force and effect as an
original. All executed counterparts and each of them shall be deemed to be
one and the same Instrument. Counsel for the parties to this  Stipulation
shall exchange among themselves original signed counterparts and a complete
set of original executed counterparts shall be filed with the Court in the
Hagen Action. </P>

<P>K. The Court in the Hagen Action shall have exclusive and continuing
jurisdiction over the implementation, interpretation, and execution of this
Stipulation and all exhibits thereto, with respect to all parties hereto,
including all Settlement Class Members. </P>

<P>L. The rights and obligations of the parties to the Stipulation shall
construed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by the laws of the
State of California. </P>

<P>On May 17, 1995, the United States Senate, by a vote of 96-3, adopted
Senate Resolution 120, which established the Special Committee to Investigate
Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters (hereinafter the "Special
Committee"), to be administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
Affairs (the "Banking Committee").  Resolution 120 charged the Special Committee
with the responsibility to conduct an extensive investigation into and to hold
public hearings on specified matters relating to the President's and Mrs.
Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater") along
with James and Susan McDougal, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association
("Madison Guaranty"), and related matters.  
<P>In discharging its responsibilities under Resolution 120, the Special
Committee deposed 274 witnesses and held 60 days of public hearings, during
which 136 witnesses testified.  The Committee also reviewed approximately 1
million pages of documents produced by the President and Mrs. Clinton, the White
House, various federal agencies, and a number of individual witnesses.
<P>Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to investigate and to hold public
hearings into three general subject areas.  Section 1(b)(1) authorized
investigation into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in
handling papers in Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster's office following
his death on July 20, 1993--the so-called Foster Phase of the Special
Committee's inquiry.
<P> With respect to the Washington Phase of the inquiry, Section 1(b)(2)
authorized investigation into whether the White House improperly interfered with
any investigations or prosecutions by various federal agencies relating to,
among other things, Whitewater, Madison Guaranty related entities, and Capital
Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").
<P>Finally, in the Arkansas Phase, &#167; 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized the
Special Committee to investigate, among other things, the activities of
Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS, Lasater & Co., and the work and billing
practices of the Rose Law Firm relating to Madison Guaranty.
1.<P>The Foster Phase.
<P>During the 103d Congress, the Banking Committee, pursuant to Senate
Resolution 229, conducted an inquiry into the cause of Mr. Foster's death and
the conduct of the subsequent investigation of his death by the United States
Park Police.  On July 15, 1994, Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. advised the
Banking Committee that "public hearings on the subject of the handling of
documents in Mr. Foster's office while this investigation is continuing could
prejudice our investigation."1  Accordingly, the Banking Committee's public
hearings on July 29, 1994 into the cause of Mr. Foster's death excluded inquiry
into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.
<P>At the conclusion of the Banking Committee's hearings in the summer of
1994, the  following matters, among others, were identified for future inquiry
relating to Mr. Foster's death:
<P>*<P>the White House interference into the Park Police search of Mr.
Foster's office;

<P>*<P>the presence of White House counsel staff during standard Park Police
investigatory interviews;

<P>*<P>the White House insistence that the Park Police investigation proceed
with Department of Justice involvement to the extent that DOJ was "calling the
shots" and "setting up protocol" and the Park Police were "stand[ing] and
waiting for permission to do our job"; and

<P>*<P>the late delivery of the note in Mr. Foster's office to Park Police,
discovered by White House counsel.2
<P>On April 22, 1995, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr advised the
Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee that his investigation
would not be hindered or impeded by a Senate inquiry into the way in which White
House officials handled documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.
<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee commenced its investigation and public
hearings into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in
handling documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  The Special
Committee recognizes that Mr. Foster's death remains a source of much grief to
his family and friends.  In conducting its inquiry under section 1(b)(1) of
Resolution 120, the Committee sought to balance carefully the need to protect
the privacy of the Foster family and its duty to carry out fully the mandate of
the Senate.
2.<P>The Washington Phase.
<P>Resolution 120 directed the Special Committee to review the handling of
several federal investigations relating to the Whitewater real estate venture;
Madison Guaranty McDougal's S&L, the failure of which cost American taxpayers
more than $60 million; and CMS, a small business investment company owned by
David Hale, who made illegal loans to James and Susan McDougal in part to
finance the Whitewater investment.  Specifically, section 1(b)(2) of the
Resolution authorized the Special Committee to conduct an investigation and
public hearings into the following matters:
<P>(A)<P>whether any person has improperly handled confidential Resolution
Trust Corporation ("RTC") information relating to Madison Guaranty or
Whitewater, including whether any person has improperly communicated such
information to individuals referenced therein;

<P>(B)<P>whether the White House has engaged in improper contacts with any
other agency or department in the Government with regard to confidential RTC
information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;

<P>(C)<P>whether the Department of Justice has improperly handled RTC
criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;

<P>(D)<P>whether RTC employees have been improperly importuned, prevented,
restrained, or deterred in conducting investigations or making enforcement
recommendations relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; and

<P>(E)<P>whether the report issued by the Office of Government Ethics on
July 31, 1994, or related transcripts of deposition testimony --

<P><P>(i)  were improperly released to White House officials or others prior
to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or

<P><P>(ii)  were used to communicate to White House officials or to others
confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater.3
<P>In conducting the inquiry mandated during this so-called "Washington Phase"
of the investigation, the Special Committee examined whether the President and
Mrs. Clinton -- or their agents -- misused the power of the presidency in
responding to a series of investigations of the Whitewater matter.  As in the
past, the Senate sought to serve as the public's watchdog, to expose abuses of
the public trust. 
<P>Of necessity, the Special Committee inquired into the investigative and
prosecutorial processes of Executive Branch agencies to determine whether the
laws were properly and faithfully executed.  Congress has a duty to investigate
allegations that the normal investigative and prosecutorial processes of the
Executive Branch have been compromised.4  More important, Congress has the
constitutional obligation to ensure that the President's private interests have
not been elevated above the public good.

3.<P>The Arkansas Phase.
<P>This is the beginning of the Whitewater matter.  In this phase of its
inquiry, the Senate charged the Special Committee with investigating the complex
web of intermingled funds, fraudulent transactions, political favors, and
conflicted relationships which comprise the "20 years of public life in
Arkansas" that Mrs. Clinton did not want an independent counsel, among others,
to look into.5
<P>Specifically, Section 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized an investigation
and public hearings into the following matters:
<P><P>(A)  the operations, solvency, and regulation of Madison Guaranty
Savings & Loan Association, and any subsidiary, affiliate, or other entity owned
or controlled by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;

<P><P>(B)  the activities, investments, and tax liability of Whitewater
Development Corporation and, as related to Whitewater Development Corporation,
of its officers, directors, and shareholders;

<P><P>(C)  the policies and practices of the RTC and the Federal banking
agencies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act) regarding the legal representation of such agencies with respect to Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;

<P><P>(D)  the handling by the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation of civil or administrative actions against parties
regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.

<P><P>(E)  the sources of funding and the lending practices of Capital
Management Services, Inc., and its supervision and regulation by the Small
Business Administration, including any alleged diversion of funds to Whitewater
Development Corporation;

<P><P>(F)  the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development
Finance Authority and Lasater & Company; and 

<P><P>(G)  the lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville,
Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.
<P>These various subjects, seemingly disparate, are nevertheless woven
together by common and recurring themes of abuse of power, fraud on federal
institutions and theft of public funds, and frequent neglect, if not deliberate
disregard, of professional, ethical, and, at times, legal standards.
<P>*  *  *
<P>The Special Committee completed its task under Resolution 120 in a
bipartisan manner.  With few notable exceptions, the Special Committee conducted
its investigation and public hearings by mutual consent between the Chairman and
Ranking Member, thus obviating the need for votes by the Special Committee.
<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often
contradictory, incomplete, or inaccurate as to important events and actions, the
Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence. 
Unfortunately, throughout its inquiry, the Committee was hindered by parties
unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical
to its investigation.  Although the White House was most often and most notably
engaged in this course of action, the pattern of noncooperation extended to
other parties, as this Report lays out more fully in the Washington Phase of the
Special Committee's inquiry.
<P>This Report of the Special Committee is divided into three separate but
interrelated parts.  Part 1 focusses on the Foster Phase of the inquiry, into
whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in the handling of
documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Part 2 summarizes
the Special Committee's investigation into the Washington Phase and discusses
the handling of federal investigations into Whitewater and related matters, the
Administration's attempts to interfere with these investigations, and the White
House's attempts to interfere with Congressional inquiries into the
Administration's alleged improprieties.  Part 3 centers on the Arkansas Phase
and details the transactions and activities that comprise Governor Clinton's web
of political, personal, and business relationships--a web that includes, among
others, Whitewater, Madison, CMS, James McDougal, David Hale, and Danny Ray
Lasater.  Each Part begins with a separate, detailed outline and concludes with
respective endnotes.
<P>These three parts are interrelated because the entire story of Whitewater
is not simply the sum of its parts.  Rather, seeping through the pages that
follow are clearly identifiable patterns of motivation, conduct, and, at times,
concealment.  Beyond discrete judgments of impropriety in particular instances,
therefore, the Special Committee has examined the evidence and reached
conclusions that transcend any individual persons, actions, or events but rather
illuminate patterns of conduct behind the Whitewater affair.
<P>The Conclusions of the Special Committee are summarized at the beginning of
each Part.  They do not answer all questions and allegations that have surfaced,
but, taken together, they provide a comprehensive survey of the facts uncovered
by the Special Committee in its 13 months of investigation.  And they offer a
full, fair, and often troubling picture of the inner workings of government that
the Senate, by an overwhelming mandate, charged the Special Committee to present
to the American people.

<P>           Questions Presented</P>

<P> 1.   Should the federal judiciary discard the teaching of Regentsof the
University of California v. Bakke, and prohibit state institutions of
higher learning from even considering race, among other factors, in
individualized admissions decisions, despite the institutions' long-settled
educational interest in promoting dialogue and learning by selecting a
diverse student body with varied backgrounds and experiences?</P>

<P> 2.   When a State's officials determine that they have a sufficient
evidentiary basis for concluding that remedial race-conscious action is
needed at one of the State's graduate schools, which itself had practiced
de jure discrimination in the past, and whose legacy of having done so
continues to affect its ability to attract and educate the best students of
all races, do the Fourteenth Amendment and principles of federalism permit
the federal judiciary: (a) to insist that those officials disregard the
additional current effects, on that graduate school's applicant pool, of de
jure discrimination in the public education of Blacks and Mexican Americans
in that State at the primary, secondary, and college levels, and (b) to
demand that those officials heed only findings made by the State
Legislature itself rather than, as state law permits, acting on findings
made by the Governor and the State Higher Education Coordinating Board?</P>

<P> 3.   Are Texas higher education admissions officials, following United
States v. Fordice, precluded from taking race into consideration even
though a race-blind admissions process would predictably recreate a system
that is effectively segregated, with almost no minorities at the State's
flagship law school and almost no white students at the law school that the
State created to avoid integration?</P>


<P> 4.   Is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, enacted under the
Spending Clause of Article I, capable of abrogating a State's Eleventh
Amendment immunity from suit in federal court without its consent, in light
of Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida?</P>

<P> 5.   May a federal court, consistent with Carey v. Piphus, impose a
presumption of compensatory damages for plaintiffs who complain of the
process that was applied to them, but who have not shown any likelihood
that they would have received a different result under a constitutionally
flawless process?</P>

<P> 6.   May a federal court, consistent with Article III, award prospective
relief against a State and its officials regarding a law school admissions
policy, when the effects of that policy are not before the court and the
"case" or "controversy" requirement is not met by any showing of actual
harm the litigants would be likely to suffer in the future without such
prospective relief?</P>

<P>         Parties to the Proceeding</P>

<P>Statement of Facts....8</P>

<P>Reasons for Granting the Writ ...12</P>

<P>1.   This Court should correct the court of appeals' misperception that
Bakke is no longer the law and  should reaffirm that  diversity remains a
compelling  interest that justifies individualized consideration  of race,
among other factors, in higher education admissions decisions......12</P>

<P>2.   This Court should clarify what State education officials may consider
as a "strong basis in the evidence" to conclude that individualized
consideration of race is necessary to remedy the present effects of the
State's own past discrimination in education..16</P>

<P>3.   This Court should clarify whether admissions officers in states having
practiced de jure segregation may, consistent with United States v.
Fordice, take race into account to ameliorate the segregative effects of
seemingly "race- neutral" admission standards......20</P>

<P>4.   This Court should settle whether, in view of Seminole Tribe of
Florida, a federal court may entertain suit against a State without its
consent under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  .......22</P>

<P>5.   This Court should settle whether Carey v. Piphus requires plaintiffs
to bear the ultimate burden of proving concrete injury before compensatory
damages may be awarded...25</P>

<P>6.   This Court should clarify the Article III limits on the power of a
federal court to issue prospective relief....28</P>

<P>Janet Elliott & Gordon Hunter,  Buying Time After Hopwood,<BR>
  Texas Lawyer, March 25, 1996......... 27</P>

<P>             Introduction</P>

<P> In the decision below, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held
that an institution of higher learning, the University of Texas School of
Law, is prohibited from considering race in any manner in its admissions
processes. This decision is the first of its kind by any federal court. In
promulgating its far-reaching rule, the court of appeals took it upon
itself to overrule, anticipatorily, the holding of a five-Justice majority
in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978),
and called into question the permissibility of considering race in
admissions programs in public colleges, universities, and professional
schools throughout the country. The national significance of the decision
is obvious. Moreover, even apart from the equal protection issue, this case
presents fundamental questions of state sovereignty and federal judicial
power.</P>

<P> There is more than a touch of irony that this case should arise out of the
same institution, the University of Texas School of Law, that provided the
basis for this Court's decision in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950),
overturning the official state ban on he admissin of Blacks to the School
of Law. There is also a harsh irony that this case should arise from the
State of Texas. The undisputed record shows that Texas students applying to
the challenged 1992 incoming class were largely the products of a  public
school system that was still under court supervision for  failing
effectively to remedy unconstitutional de jure segregation.</P>

<P>Not contested below, but unmentioned in the Fifth Circuit's opinion, is the
effective resegregation of the University of Texas  School of Law that
would result if the Fifth Circuit's decision were left intact. The School
of Law is the State's flagship institution, charged with training the
leaders of the State and beyond. The Fifth Circuit's decision would have
produced, in a State whose population approaches forty percent Blacks and
Mexican Americans, a 1992 incoming class with at most a handful of Blacks
and Mexican Americans, out of more than five hundred students.</P>


<P> The central question before this Court is whether the Constitution compels
this result.</P>

<P> Opinions Below</P>

<P> The opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
filed March 18, 1996 (Appendix A), is to be reported at 78 F.3d 932. The
opinion of the United States District Court for the Western District of
Texas, dated August 19, 1994 (Appendix B), is reported at 861 F. Supp. 551.
On April 4, 1996, the Court of Appeals entered an order denying rehearing
en banc and indicating that a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc
was forthcoming. Appendix C. On April 19, 1996, the Court of Appeals,
pursuant to Fed. R. App. Proc. 41, stayed its mandate until May 13, 1996,
to permit the filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari. Appendix
D. On April 23, 1996, the Fifth Circuit released two opinions, joined by a
total of seven of the Court of Appeals' seventeen active judges (one of
whom had recused himself), dissenting from the Court's failure to grant
rehearing en banc. Appendix E.</P>

<P> Jurisdiction</P>

<P> The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
was filed on March 18, 1996. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28

<P> Statement of the Case</P>

<P> Proceedings Below</P>

<P> Respondents are four white applicants denied admission to the 1992
entering class at The University of Texas School of Law (the "Law School").
This action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Texas. Respondents alleged that petitioners administered a
racially discriminatory admissions program at the Law School, in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d; and 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and
1983. But for the Eleventh Amendment, the district court would have had
subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343.</P>

<P> Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, that the
Eleventh Amendment precluded this action against the State of Texas, its
subdivisions, and officers acting in their official capacities. The
district court denied that motion in an unpublished opinion dated October
28, 1993. R. 588-605.</P>

<P> After an eight-day bench trial in May 1994, the district court declared
invalid the Law School's 1992 admissions procedure insofar as it employed a
separate subcommittee for evaluating minority applicants. App. at B58-59.
The court held this aspect of the 1992 procedure constitutionally infirm
because it was not narrowly tailored to meet the State's compelling
interests in seeking the educational benefits that flow from having a
diverse student body and in redressing the continuing effects of
discriminatory practices by the educational hierarchy of Texas.  The
district court held that it did not need to decide the constitutionality of
a second feature of the 1992 procedure the use of different presumptive
denial scores for minority and nonminority candidates because "none of the
plaintiffs in this lawsuit was affected directly by this aspect of the 1992
procedure." Id. at B52 n.71. The State did not appeal the district court's
ruling with respect to the 1992 policy, having abandoned that policy in
1994 in favor of one that treated race as simply a factor in the
individualized consideration and comparison of applicants to the Law
School.</P>

<P> In crafting a remedy, the district court awarded respondents nominal
damages only, because the State had shown "that legitimate,
nondiscriminatory grounds exist for the Law School's denial of admission to
each of the four plaintiffs and that, in all likelihood, the plaintiffs
would not have been offered admission even under a constitutionally
permissible process." App. at B65.  The court explained that 109
nonminority residents with numerical scores lower than Hopwood's were
offered admission, and that sixty-seven nonminority residents with
numerical scores lower than the other three plaintiffs were admitted,
leading to the inference that weaknesses in respondents' applications,
completely apart from their numerical scores, had triggered the Law
School's decision not to admit them. Id. at B63-64. In fact, the court
observed that "it appears that the majority of applicants, both minority
and nonminority, made considerable effort to inform the admissions
committee of their special qualifications through extensive answer to the
questions on the application form or through personal statements," and
"[m]ost files contained one, if not several, letters of recommendation."
Id. at B64. Respondents' files were notably bare. "In fact, of all the
applications the Court reviewed, Hopwood's provides the least information
about her background and individual qualifications and is the least
impressive in appearance, despite her relatively high numbers." Id.</P>

<P> The court declined to impose prospective injunctive relief with respect to
the Law School's admissions policy because the Law School had adopted a new
admissions policy during the litigation that "appears to remedy the defects
the Court has found in the 1992 procedure," App. at B67, and because
"neither a plaintiff denied admission under the new system nor evidence of
the practical application of the new procedure is before this Court."  Id.
Under the new policy, the Law School does not use a separate minority
subcommittee or different presumptive admission or denial scores for
minority and nonminority applicants. Id. at B67 n.87. Each candidate is
given fully individualized treatment on his or her own merits; race is
considered, along with myriad other matters, such as socio-economic status,
employment history, extra-curricular  activities as an undergraduate, and
other factors that make up a person's life experiences and affect what the
person can contribute to the educational dialogue, both inside class and
out. Although the Law School attempts to meet the targets (established by
the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education) of ten
percent Mexican American students and five percent Black students in an
entering class, these targets are purely aspirational.</P>

<P> The district court ordered that respondents be permitted to reapply under
the new policy without being charged an application fee. App. at B67-68.
But the court denied attorney's fees to respondents, on the ground that
they had "failed to prove they would have been offered admission under a
constitutional procedure" and "the de minimis nature of the relief the
plaintiffs received is insufficient to justify an award of attorney's
fees." Hopwood v. State of Texas, No. A-92-CA-563, mem. op. at 2, 4 (Nov.
14, 1994).</P>

<P> The court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding broadly that
"the law school may not use race as a factor in law school admissions."
App. at A3. With respect to the State's interest in enriching the
educational experience of all its law students by encouraging the admission
of, among others, Blacks and Mexican Americans, the court of appeals held
that "the use of ethnic diversity simply to achieve racial heterogeneity,
even as part of a number of factors, is unconstitutional. . . . [T]he use
of race per se is proscribed . . . ." Id. at A27. The Fifth Circuit opined
that the consideration of race to promote diversity "is no more rational on
its own terms than would be choices based upon the physical size or blood
type of applicants." Id. at A26.</P>

<P> With respect to remedying the present effects of de jure discrimination in
Texas public education, the court held that the Law School was the only
"relevant . . . past discriminator." App. at A40. "As a result, past
discrimination in education, other than at the law school, cannot justify
the present consideration of race in law school admissions." Id. at A45.</P>

<P> The court of appeals ruled that the district court erred in requiring the
plaintiffs to prove that they had been injured by the Law School admissions
procedures in place in 1992. Instead, the court held that "once
discrimination is proved, the defendant bears the burden of proving no
damage." Id. at A49 n.53. Accordingly, the court remanded to the district
court the task of calculating compensatory damages.</P>

<P> The court of appeals also issued a series of "judicial instruction[s]" to
the Law School, commanding it not to consider race as a factor in the
admissions process "for the purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student
body; (2) altering the school's reputation in the community; (3) combating
the school's perceived hostile environment toward minorities; or (4)
remedying the present effects of past discrimination by actors other than
the law school." Id. at A55.</P>

<P> Judge Wiener, specially concurring, "respectfully disagree[d] with the
panel opinion's conclusion that diversity can never be a compelling
governmental interest in a public graduate school." Id. at A64. He
nonetheless concluded that the 1992 Law School admissions process was not
narrowly tailored to this interest.  Judge Wiener also expressed
reservations about the scope of relief issued by the court, warning that
the majority had "inappropriate[ly]" issued "a de facto injunction" against
respondents. Id. at A73. He cautioned that the plaintiffs had challenged
"only the admissions process employed by the law school in 1992 -- not the
admissions process that was in place and employed in 1995, not the
admissions process that is being employed in 1996, and not the admissions
process to be applied in any future years." Id. at A75.</P>

<P> On April 4, 1996, the court of appeals denied rehearing en banc and
announced that a dissent from the denial of rehearing would be released.
Appendix C. On April 19, 1996, the court of appeals granted petitioners a
28-day stay pending the filing and disposition of this petition for writ of
certiorari. In light of "the magnitude of the case" and "the importance of
the issue," the court determined that "there is a reasonable chance that
four Justices will vote to grant certiorari." The court also held that
petitioners had met their burden of demonstrating irreparable injury in the
absence of a stay.</P>

<P> On April 23, 1996, the court of appeals released two opinions dissenting
from the Fifth Circuit's failure to grant en banc rehearing. Chief Judge
Politz, joined by six other judges, filed a dissent warning that the
panel's opinion "will literally change the face of public educational
institutions throughout Texas, the other states of this circuit, and this
nation." App. at E3. The Chief Judge described the court's decision as "a
text book example of judicial activism" and "a frontal assault on contrary
Supreme Court precedent." Id. "[T]he panel charted a path into terra
incognita.  Judicial restraint was the first casualty; it proved to be too
burdensome. The teachings proscribing the consideration of constitutional
issues unnecessary to the decision soon followed.  With these two
limitations adroitly set aside, the panel majority apparently considered
itself positioned to overrule Bakke." Id. at E7:</P>

<P>By tenuously stringing together pieces and shards of recent Supreme Court
opinions that have dealt with race in such diverse settings as minority set
asides for government contractors, broadcast licenses, redistricting, and
the like, the panel creates a gossamer chain which it proffers as a
justification for overruling Bakke. . . . The syllogisms tacked together
and proffered by the majority opinion as proof that Justice Powell's
diversity conclusion is no longer good law do not, under any standards of
which we are aware, qualify as an overruling of Bakke.</P>

<P>App. at E3, 7.</P>

<P> Judge Stewart filed a separate dissent from the Court of Appeals' failure
to grant rehearing en banc, in order "to underscore the [court's] lack of
historical perspective and sensitivity." App. at E9. Judge Stewart observed
that the University of Texas School of Law was the same institution whose
admissions policies were at issue in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629
(1950). He also noted that, in holding that the Law School had violated the
Equal Protection Clause by excluding Heman Sweatt, this Court explicitly
adhered to the " principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the
context of the particular case before the Court,' drawing its decision as
narrowly as possible.' " Id. (quoting 339 U.S. at 631). Judge Stewart
criticized the Fifth Circuit majority for disregarding that guiding
principle here, calling its failure to grant rehearing en banc a
"travesty." Id. at E10.</P>

<P> Statement of Facts</P>

<P> "Texas' long history of discrimination against its black and Hispanic
citizens in all areas of public life is not the subject of dispute." LULAC
v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 866 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct.
878 (1994); id. at 915 (King, J., dissenting).  The district court
confirmed this history in extensive factual findings that the court of
appeals did not disturb. App. at B3-10.</P>

<P> In 1977, the District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the United States Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) (now the Department of Education or DOE) to
investigate discrimination in Texas' system of higher education. App. at
B6-8; D296. See Adams v. Richardson, 356 F. Supp. 92 (D.D.C.mexican),
modified and aff'd, 480 F.2d 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1973), dism'd sub nom. Women's
Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Following a
two-year investigation, OCR found in 1980 that Texas had failed to
eliminate the vestiges of its segregated higher education system and was in
violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000d.</P>

<P> As a remedy, Texas agreed to adopt the Texas Equal Education Opportunity
Plan for Higher Education (Texas Plan).  OCR required that the Texas Plan
include a commitment to "seek to achieve proportions of Blacks and Hispanic
Texas graduates from undergraduate institutions in the State who enter
graduate study or professional schools in the State at least equal to the
proportion of white Texas graduates from undergraduate institutions in the
State who enter such programs." App. at B9 n.6; D238a at 5.</P>


<P> In 1983, just eight years before respondents applied to the Law School,
Texas agreed, under threat of federal action, to formulate an acceptable
plan to desegregate its higher education system, including the Law School.
But in January 1994, the Department of Education notified Governor Richards
that OCR was still overseeing Texas' desegregation efforts and would review
the Texas system in light of United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992).
App. at B10. DOE has yet to determine that Texas' higher education system
has come into compliance with Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment. Id.</P>

<P> In 1983, as a higher education desegregation plan was still being
formulated, respondents Elliott and Rogers were students at the University
of Texas. P153; P171. Respondent Carvell was attending Texas public
schools. P151. As the district court found, during the 1980s most Texas
students lived in school districts whose public schools the federal courts
and the United States Department of Justice had determined were still
unconstitutionally segregated. App. at B46; D434. Over seventy percent of
Blacks in Texas lived in metropolitan areas operating under court-ordered
desegregation plans. 19 Tr. 43; D378B. Many school districts were found to
practice official discrimination against Mexican-American  as well as
against Black students. App. at B4. On the eve of trial, which fell on the
fortieth anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),
federal and private desegregation lawsuits were still pending against over
forty Texas school districts. App. at B4; D457.</P>

<P> The district court found that Texas residents who applied for admission to
the Law School in fall 1992 would have spent most, if not all, of their
pre-college education in a school system suffering the effects of
unconstitutional segregation. App. at B46.  The court found that official
discrimination had "handicapped the educational achievement of many
minorities." Id. Because the State of Texas required that eighty-five
percent of the Law School's 1992 entering class be Texas residents, the
court found that inferior educational opportunity particularly affected the
Law School's current pool of qualified resident minority applicants. Id. at
B46, B23-24.</P>

<P> The district court further found that the pool of qualified resident
minority applicants was artificially constricted not only by Texas'
unconstitutional public school system, but also by the reputation of the
University and the Law School as "white" institutions with an environment
hostile to minorities. App. at B45. The court found that, despite extensive
recruiting efforts, the Law School's legacy of discrimination has hindered
efforts to attract qualified minority students. Id.</P>

<P> The district court also made extensive findings regarding the importance
of diversity in institutions of higher learning. The district court found,
and the court of appeals did not question, that grade point averages and
LSAT scores do not "adequately reflect the qualifications and
characteristics a law school should consider in developing a diverse
student body, which provides substantial educational benefit for all
members of a law school class." App. at B25. In fact, the ABA and American
Association of Law Schools each requires commitment to diversity in the
student body as a prerequisite for membership or accreditation. 18 Tr.
26-28; D387; D389; D391; D395. The district court reached its conclusion
only after considering extensive testimony from deans of law schools across
the country, from current and former law students, and from law professors.</P>

<P> Reasons for Granting the Writ</P>

<P>1. This Court should correct the court of appeals' misperception that Bakke
is no longer the law and should reaffirm that educational diversity remains
a compelling interest that justifies individualized consideration of race,
among other factors, in higher education admissions decisions.</P>

<P> The two-judge majority held that it was unconstitutional for the Law
School even to consider the race of individual applicants "for the purpose
of obtaining a diverse student body," in flat violation of Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). The majority
opinion maintained that, "in significant part," Justice Powell's opinion
"was joined by no other justice," App. at A19; that "Justice Powell's
argument in Bakke garnered only his own vote and has never represented the
view of the majority of the Court in Bakke or any other case," App. at A23;
and that "Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent." Id.</P>

<P> But the court of appeals ignored the holding of five Justices, who joined
in Part V-C of Justice Powell's opinion, that it was not impermissible for
the University of California to consider race as a factor in making
admissions decisions:</P>

<P> In enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant,
however, the courts below failed to recognize that the State has a
substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised
admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and
ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the California court's judgment
as enjoins petitioner from any consideration of the race of any applicant
must be reversed.</P>

<P> Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320 (opinion of the Court per Powell, J.); id. at 328
(opinion of Brennan, J., joined by White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.,
concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (joining in Part
V-C of Justice Powell's opinion).</P>

<P> Exercise of this Court's certiorari jurisdiction would be amply warranted
by a lower court's determination, under any circumstances, that a holding
by this Court is no longer good law.  Bakke's landmark status, and the
paramount national interest in establishing, definitively, whether lower
courts remain bound to follow it, represent further compelling reasons for
this Court to review the decision below. For the last two decades,
institutions of higher education have relied on Bakke to include race among
the characteristics considered in composing student bodies that are not
only bright, but diverse, to make education and the dialogue that advances
it more effective and relevant to the society that graduates will enter.
Longstanding and widespread reliance on Bakke counsel against its
overruling, see Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 861-69 (1992),
and particularly against permitting the lower courts simply to discard it.</P>

<P> Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself recognized the important need for this
Court's review and was able to declare Bakke's death only on the basis of
concurring and dissenting opinions by the members of this Court and
academic commentary. In fact, however, the Fifth Circuit's report of
Bakke's demise was premature. The compelling interest in promoting
educational diversity was recognized long before Bakke and has been
recognized even by those who reject diversity as a compelling interest in
other contexts. Compare Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286
(1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("a state interest in the promotion of
racial diversity has been found sufficiently compelling,' at least in the
context of higher education, to support the use of racial considerations in
furthering that interest") and id. at 288 n. (noting the difference between
providing role models and "the very different goal of racial diversity
among the faculty") with Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 614
(1990) (O'Connor, J. dissenting) (disagreeing with extending the interest
in diversity to the award of broadcast licenses).</P>

<P> Diversity is an especially compelling interest in legal education. No
other discipline deals so fundamentally with the ordering of human
relationships in our society, including racial and ethnic minorities who
have been subjected to discrimination:</P>

<P> [A]lthough the law is a highly learned profession, we are well aware that
it is an intensely practical one. The law school, the proving ground for
legal learning and practice, cannot be effective in isolation from the
individuals and institutions with which the law interacts.</P>

<P> Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 634 (1950); see also Wygant, 476 U.S. at
314-15 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (endorsing diversity rationale). The First
Amendment dimension of educational policy choices, by State as well as
private higher educational institutions, adds to the compelling nature of
the diversity interest. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.)
(noting that "academic freedom" has "long . . . been viewed as a special
concern of the First Amendment").</P>

<P> Whatever the status of Bakke, the issue should be decided by this Court,
so that the same rule applies across the country. The question is so
fundamental as to warrant resolution on a nationwide basis. The Law School,
for its part, is now severely handicapped in competing with, say, Harvard,
Stanford, or Michigan to attract top students and faculty, because it can
no longer ensure a truly diverse student body. Minority students in Texas,
Louisiana, and Mississippi may be given special consideration by colleges
and universities on the east and west coasts, but not in their home states.
This imbalance is as ironic as it is intolerable, given the long history of
official discrimination in the education of minorities in these Gulf Coast
states. See, e.g., App. at B3-10; United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717,
721-25 (1992); United States v. Louisiana, 692 F. Supp. 642, 644-46 (E.D.
La. 1988).</P>

<P> 2. This Court should clarify what State education officials may consider
as a "strong basis in the evidence" to conclude that individualized
consideration of race is necessary to remedy the present effects of the
State's own past discrimination in education.</P>

<P> The district court chronicled Texas' history of official discrimination in
the education of Blacks and Mexican Americans at all levels of the State
system. App. at B3-10. The court carefully assessed the impact of this
undisputed discrimination on the Law School, particularly in view of the
state legislative mandate that eighty-five percent of the Law School's 1992
entering class (eighty percent today) be Texas residents. Id at B23-24 and
n.33. The court found the ultimate effect stark and severe: in the absence
of some attention to race, the 1992 entering class at the Law School would
have included at most a handful of Blacks and Mexican Americans. These
figures, chilling as they are, are overly optimistic, given the Law
School's own history. "[T]he record in this case demonstrates that, without
affirmative action, the perception of the law school as a white'
institution would be exacerbated, which would compound the difficulties of
attracting top minority students." Id. at B48.</P>

<P> Rejecting petitioners' remedial purpose, the court of appeals held that
remedying the ongoing effects even of de jure discrimination can never be a
compelling interest unless the only past discrimination that the remedy is
designed to overcome is discrimination previously practiced by the
governmental actor that installed and administered the remedy in this case,
the Law School itself. The justification for remedial action by the Law
School thus cannot be augmented by findings of official discrimination by
the State of Texas in primary and secondary education or in state higher
education generally. "The Supreme Court . by a specific governmental unit."
App. at A38 n.43.</P>

<P> In fact, this Court has never so severely restrained a state's ability to
remedy the present effects of pervasive past discrimination in its own
public education system. In Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469
(1989), Justice O'Connor, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice White,
squarely rejected the suggestion that a city was required to "limit any
race-based remedial efforts to eradicating the effects of its own prior
discrimination." Id. at 486 (emphasis added). Instead, the Justices took
the broader view that a state or subdivision "has the authority to
eradicate [even] the effects of private discrimination within its own
legislative jurisdiction," i.e., "within local commerce under its
jurisdiction." Id. at 491-92 (emphasis added). "Thus, if the city could
show that it had essentially become a passive participant' in a system of
racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry,
we think it clear that the city could take affirmative steps to dismantle
such a system." Id. at 492.</P>

<P> The State of Texas has been no mere "passive participant" in the past
exclusion of Blacks and Mexican Americans from equal opportunity in public
education. Even the court of appeals acknowledged that "Texas state actors
have discriminated against some minorities in public schools" and that
"lingering effects of such discrimination is [sic] not societal,' if that
term is meant to exclude all state action." App. at A39. The court
nevertheless concluded that recognizing any remedial interest in this case
would allow "generalized assertions" of past discrimination, based on
"amorphous claim[s]" and even "sheer speculation," to justify remedial
efforts with "no logical stopping point" aimed at redressing societal
discrimination. Id. at A36-37. This conclusion is refuted by the district
court's extensive fact findings demonstrating the close nexus between
Texas' discrimination and the pool of residents from which the Law School
was required to draw eighty-five percent of its students. See, e.g., id. at
B46.  ("many public schools in Texas continued to have a substantial degree
of racial and ethnic segregation during the 1970s and 1980s, the decades in
which the majority of 1992 law school applicants attended primary and
secondary schools.").</P>

<P> The court of appeals' reasoning conflicts with the decisions of other
circuits recognizing that the extensive factual findings of a district
court, especially when coupled with determinations like those by the Office
for Civil Rights of the Department of Education and the district court in
the Adams litigation, provide ample predicate for a race-conscious remedial
program. The Fifth Circuit's decision in this case also conflicts with
Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986), which upheld the
consideration of race in admissions in a pre-professional program at the
University of Tennessee.</P>

<P> Even though the State of Texas is the lead defendant in this case and the
fountainhead of Texas' past de jure discrimination at all levels of public
education, the court of appeals held that, for the State to be considered
the relevant governmental actor, "the State of Texas, through its
legislature, would have to find that past discrimination has present
effects . . . ." App. at A39 (emphasis added). In fact, the State of Texas,
acting through its governor, effectively made such findings in agreeing to
the higher education remedial program implemented in the Texas plans. See
App. at B8.  More fundamentally, the court of appeals' holding offended
principles of federalism and state sovereignty insofar as it held that the
State of Texas is not free to structure its system of governance for public
education such that the governor, the boards of regents, and other state
officials have some degree of flexibility in deciding for themselves that
the lingering present effects on the Law School of de jure racial
discrimination and segregation practiced largely at lower levels of the
State's educational hierarchy are serious enough to require a
race-conscious remedy in the Law School's own admissions policies. "
Congress need [not] make particularized findings in order to legislate.'"
United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 1631 (1995) (citation omitted).
Demanding that a State do so and that it speak expressly and exclusively
through its legislature is unduly intrusive on the State's freedom, under
Art. IV,  4 (the Republican Form of Government Clause) and the Tenth
Amendment, to structure its decisionmaking authority as it sees fit.</P>

<P> In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (1995), this Court
emphasized that "[t]he unhappy persistence of both the practice and the
lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this
country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from
acting in response to it."  Id. at 2117; see also id. at 2114
(distinguishing between a "No Trespassing" sign and a "welcome mat"). The
record of this case fully demonstrates the Law School's remedial
justification for considering race in its admissions decisions. This
Court's review is amply warranted.</P>

<P> 3. This Court should clarify whether admissions officers in states having
practiced de jure segregation may, consistent with United States v.
Fordice, take race into account to ameliorate the present segregative
effects of seemingly "race-neutral" admission standards.</P>

<P> This is not just an affirmative action case; it is a desegregation case.
Until the court of appeals' opinion, Texas higher education institutions,
including the Law School, continued to operate under a series of
desegregation plans originally mandated and monitored by OCR.</P>

<P> States have an especially compelling interest in remedying the effects of
past discrimination in their own education systems.  Fordice, 505 U.S. at
727-28; see Croson, 488 U.S. at 524 (Scalia, J., concurring)
(distinguishing school desegregation cases from employment set-asides);
Hammon v. Barry, 813 F.2d 412, 421  n.18 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Starr, J.)
(distinguishing employment set-asides  from "the unique and sensitive area
of education" and "the government's fundamental interest in education" that
may "support the use of racial considerations"), cert. denied, 486 U.S.
1036 (1988). Indeed, states that operated officially segregated systems of
higher education have a broad affirmative duty under both the Fourteenth
Amendment and Title VI to dismantle those systems.  Fordice, 505 U.S. at
727-28. That duty is not satisfied merely by adopting race-neutral
policies. Rather, the state must take affirmative steps to ameliorate
practices and policies that perpetuate the dual system. Id. at 728. That
constitutional duty may require a state either to eliminate, or to
counteract and minimize to the extent possible, strict reliance on test
scores that effectively segregate white and minority students. Id. at
737-38; id. at 744 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</P>

<P> Without consideration of race, the Law School would come perilously close
to this Court's warning in Fordice. As the district court found:</P>

<P> [T]he ultimate effect of abandoning affirmative action at the law school
would be to redirect minorities to the historically separate state law
school at Texas Southern University, thereby resegregating the law school.</P>

<P> App. at B47. TSU, which was created to avoid integrating The University of
Texas and the Law School (and is still called "The House That Sweatt
Built"), today enrolls over half of all minority law students in Texas. Its
student body is nearly seventy-five percent minorities. The evidence was
undisputed that if Texas is compelled to abandon any consideration of race
at its state law schools, it will return to a starkly dual system of legal
education. Few minorities would attend the historically white law schools,
while seventy-seven percent of minority law students in Texas would attend
TSU, whose student body would be eighty-five percent Blacks and Mexican
Americans. 12 Tr. 44-45; D452; D453.</P>

<P> 4. This Court should settle whether, in view of Seminole Tribe of Florida,
a federal court may entertain suit against a State without its consent
under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</P>

<P> Respondents brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983, and under Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d et seq. In the
district court, the State raised an Eleventh Amendment defense in its
motion for summary judgment. Although the district court's decision to deny
both injunctive relief and compensatory damages made that jurisdictional
objection less salient, it was error of the first constitutional magnitude
for the court of appeals to proceed as though the Eleventh Amendment limit
on federal court jurisdiction was "simply not before [it]." App. at A52
n.56. To the contrary, the court reversed the trial court's refusal to
award compensatory damages and remanded with instructions that respondents
were presumptively entitled to damages against the State defendants. Id. at
A51.</P>

<P> As this Court squarely held in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 116
S.Ct. 1114, 1131 (1996), the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to the exercise of
subject matter jurisdiction by the federal courts in suits brought by
citizens of a State against that State. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1
(1890). The court of appeals had no subject-matter jurisdiction to
entertain an action against Texas and its officials in clear derogation of
the protections of traditional sovereign immunity contained in the Eleventh
Amendment.</P>

<P> Respondents' claims for damages are predicated solely on Title VI, which
this Court has already determined is a classic Spending Clause statute. In
light of Seminole Tribe, it is plain that Congress lacks constitutional
authority simply to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity
pursuant to Article I, whether through mandatory legislation enacted under
the Commerce Clause or through mandatory legislation enacted under the
Spending Clause. See id., 116 S.Ct. at 1126 (no "principled distinction"
may be drawn between various Article I powers). The Spending Clause -- even
more plainly than the Commerce Clause and in stark contrast to the
Fourteenth Amendment's Section 5, which was "adopted well after the
adoption of the Eleventh Amendment," id. at 1127 -- is not "a grant of
authority to the Federal Government at the expense of the States." Id. at
1126. See Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 597 (1937)(Spending
Clause, while permitting States to contract "with Congress if the essence
of their statehood is maintained without impairment," does not thereby
reduce state authority, for "[e]ven sovereigns may contract without
derogating from their sovereignty").</P>

<P> State amenability to suit could be drawn only from Congress's 1986
amendment of Title VI to provide, in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-7(a)(1), that a
"State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment . . . from suit in
Federal court for a violation of . . . Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 . . . , or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting
discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance." In enacting
that provision, Congress sought by legislative dictate to override this
Court's holding in Guardians Ass'n, supra, that limited Title VI remedies
to prospective injunctive relief for unintentional violations of the Act.
463 U.S. at 602.</P>

<P> This assertion of federal legislative power to abrogate sovereign immunity
cannot survive Seminole Tribe. This Court has now ruled that the provisions
of Article I of the Constitution</P>

<P> necessarily including the Spending Clause give Congress no power
unilaterally to overcome the Eleventh Amendment: "Article I cannot be used
to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal
jurisdiction." 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32.  Plainly, under this analysis, Title
VI, which operates "not [as] a regulatory measure, but an exercise [under
the Spending Clause] of the unquestioned power of the Federal Government to
fix the terms on which Federal funds shall be disbursed,'" Guardians Ass'n,
463 U.S. at 599, is incapable of abrogating the Eleventh Amendment immunity
of the States. The inescapable conclusion is that, when Congress sought in
1986 unilaterally to override state sovereign immunity, it was putting its
power under the Spending Clause of Article I to a use that this Court has
now definitively held impermissible.</P>

<P> 5. This Court should settle whether Carey v. Piphus still requires
plaintiffs to bear the ultimate burden of proving concrete injury before
they may be awarded compensatory damages.</P>

<P> The court of appeals recognized the "well-established rule must prove that
they have been injured." Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,254-57 (1978). App.
at A49. Nevertheless, the court held that, because respondents demonstrated
a constitutional violation, under Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.
v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977), the burden shifted to petitioners to
prove that respondents "would not have gained admittance to the law school
under a race-blind system." Id. at A51. In so holding, the court of appeals
recognized a split among the circuits on what Mt. Healthy means in racial
preference cases, id. at A50 n.54. It then proceeded to err in applying Mt.
Healthy. This Court should settle whether Mt. Healthy relieves plaintiffs
of the burden imposed by Carey to prove that the constitutional violation
they claim caused the injury for which they seek compensation.</P>

<P> In Carey, this Court held that the common law of torts governs the award
of compensatory damages in a  1983 action.  Thus, plaintiffs must prove
not only that their constitutional rights were violated, but also that the
violation caused the injury for which they seek compensation. 435 U.S. at
254-65. Absent proof of concrete damages, only nominal damages may be
awarded. Id. at 266-67.</P>

<P> The district court therefore correctly held that, "[b]ecause the
plaintiffs have failed to establish that they would have been admitted
under a constitutional system, they are not entitled to [compensatory]
damages. Further, had the plaintiffs been entitled to damages, none of them
established monetary damages as required under the law . . . ." App. at
B69. Nothing in the trial or appellate record shows otherwise. A plaintiff
showing a constitutional violation in the process applied to that plaintiff
can "recover compensatory damages only if he prove[s] actual injury caused
by the denial of his constitutional rights." Memphis Comm. School Dist. v.
Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 307 (1986).</P>

<P> The court of appeals erred in holding that Mt. Healthy and Village of
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp, 429 U.S. 252
(1977), placed on the State the burden to demonstrate plaintiffs' lack of
injury once plaintiffs had shown a violation of the Constitution. To the
contrary, in Mt. Healthy, this Court held only that, once a plaintiff
proves that an impermissible consideration was a "substantial factor" in
causing the plaintiff concrete injury (such as the loss of a job), the
burden then shifts to the defendant to show that it would have reached the
same decision in the absence of the constitutional violation. 429 U.S. at
287.  Here, the consideration of race by the Law School in its admission
decisions was not a "substantial factor" in the respondents' failure to
gain admission. The district court considered evidence that forty-two
nonminority residents with statistical scores higher than or equal to
respondents' were denied admission, and 151 nonminority residents with
scores lower than or equal to respondents' were offered admission. P139.
Accordingly, the burden never shifted to petitioners to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that they would have reached the same
decision on respondents' applications in the absence of a consideration of
race.  Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.</P>

<P> Indeed, the court of appeals' decision illustrates why Mt. Healthy should
not be used as the court of appeals used it in cases involving
race-conscious affirmative action. For the circuit court's decision has
placed respondents in a better position than they would have occupied had
the Law School never adopted an affirmative action plan at all, the very
result Mt. Healthy was concerned to avoid. See, 429 U.S. at 285. The court
of appeals has in effect presumed that respondents are entitled to
admission simply because the Law School considered race in its admissions
decisions, despite evidence of "non-race based weaknesses in [their]
applications." App. at B62; D-338.</P>

<P> The mischief this error has created is momentous, even in the instant
case. The court of appeals has now opened the courthouse doors to literally
hundreds of frustrated white applicants, the vast majority of whom would
not have been admitted even under a race-blind policy all of them demanding
substantial damages and/or instant admission to the Law School. The threat
is not hypothetical. The precedential implications for other cases are
sweeping.</P>

<P> 6. This Court should clarify the Article III limits on the power of a
federal court to issue prospective relief.</P>

<P> A final respect in which the court of appeals' judgment warrants this
Court's review arises from the Fifth Circuit's decision to award
prospective relief, in the form of thinly-veiled judicial "directives" to
the University of Texas, regarding the admissions policy for 1995-96 and
beyond a policy which was not before the court of appeals. The district
court properly declined to issue such relief, and the Fifth Circuit's
decision to award it raises grave questions under the "case" or
"controversy" requirement of Article III.</P>

<P> Under Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983), and Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife Fed'n, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), there is no Article
III case or controversy with respect to prospective relief here. For the
aspect of the 1992 program invalidated by the district court has long since
been discontinued and will not be reinstated. And, as to the current
admissions policy, the first point to note is that the record is barren of
support for the speculation that plaintiffs will reapply under it or be
affected by it in any way. Since make-whole relief would be available, if
warranted, to each individual plaintiff in the form of an order of
admission, there is no standing to seek prospective relief against the
admissions policy as a whole. In order to claim the latter, plaintiffs
would have to assert the rights of other, nonspecific potential parties who
might be adversely affected by that policy in the future. This type of
claim falls outside the case or controversy requirements of Article III.</P>

<P> A second and equally decisive Article III objection to prospective relief
in this case is that, even if plaintiffs had demonstrated a high likelihood
that they would indeed reapply to the Law School, the record contains far
too little information about the current admissions policy the only policy
that could affect them prospectively to evaluate its concrete effect on
their prospects. The record discloses what the new policy does not do:  it
does not use separate committees or statistical benchmarks for minorities.
App. at B67 n.87. The new policy permits race to be considered only on an
individualized basis, as one of many factors needed to produce diversity,
and the percentage goals set by the Texas Plan for Blacks and Mexican
Americans are purely aspirational.</P>

<P> The only "injury" respondents could suffer under the admissions program
the Fifth Circuit halted even assuming that they would reapply, which the
record emphatically does not establish would involve the individualized
consideration of race as one of many factors. But mere exposure to such
consideration of one's race, apart from any effect such consideration might
have on one's concrete situation, would be the kind of diffuse,
unparticularized "harm" that this Court has held does not suffice for
purposes of Article III. See, e.g., United States v. Hays, 115 S.Ct. 2431,
2435-36 (1995).</P>

<P> There was accordingly no justification for the Fifth Circuit to address
the constitutionality, in this prospective context, of the 1996 admissions
process, or to issue elaborate "directives" to the Law School and other
institutions, when the plaintiffs had not begun to satisfy the
prerequisites for such intrusive equitable relief.</P>

<P> Conclusion</P>

<P> The petition for writ of certiorari should be granted.</P>

<P>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT </P>

<P>No. 95-1773.  Decided July 1, 1996</P>

<P>The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. </P>

<P>Opinion of JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, respecting
the
denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari. </P>

<P>Whether it is constitutional for a public college or graduate school to
use
race or national origin as a factor in its admissions process is an issue
of great national importance.  The petition before us, however, does not
challenge the lower courts' judgments that the particular admissions
procedure used by the University of Texas Law School in 1992 was
unconstitutional.  Acknowledging that the 1992 admissions program "has long
since been discontinued and will not be reinstated," Pet. for Cert. 28, the
petitioners do not defend that program in this Court, see Reply to Brief in
Opposition 1, 3; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n.
13 ("We agree that the 1992 [admissions] policy was constitutionally flawed
. . . .").  Instead, petitioners challenge the rationale relied on by the
Court of Appeals. "[T]his Court," however, "reviews judgments, not
opinions." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we must
await a final judgment on a program genuinely in controversy before
addressing the important question raised in this petition.  See Reply to
Brief in Opposition 2 ("[A]ll concede this record is inadequate to assess
definitively" the constitutionality of the law school's current
consideration of race in its admissions process.). </P>

Editor's note: Thomas Hale Boggs Jr. is one of the most prominent lobbyists in
the country. No stranger to the halls of power, he is the son of two members of
Congress. His father was the late Hale Boggs, former House Majority Leader. His
mother, Corinne Claiborne Boggs, served in the 93rd to 101st Congresses as a
Representative from the 2nd District of Louisiana. Boggs is online on Counsel
Connect discussing the role he's played as lobbyist in Washington, D.C., during
the last 30 years. Here he is discussing the usefulness of lobbying.

<P>A common criticism is that the use of lobbying by special interests is unfair,
that if members of Congress respond to the influence of special interests, they
are somehow acting contrary to the benefit of their constituents as a whole. How
do you respond to that? What legitimate role do lobbyists play in policy-making?</P>

<P>It is very popular among politicians and media commentators alike to criticize
the influence of "special interests" in Washington.  We are to believe that if
Members of Congress respond to "special interests" they are somehow acting
contrary to the benefit of their constituents as a whole. </P>

<P>I believe that all interests are special.  Every individual and organization has
the right to advance their own interests.  The First Amendment to the
Constitution protects the right to petition the government for redress of your
grievances.  What could be more noble than exercising your constitutional
rights? </P>

<P>Thousands and thousands of registered and unregistered lobbyists work to
represent the interests of tens of thousands of "special" causes.  Most major
religious organizations have representatives in Washington, as do the Boy Scouts
of America, consumers, and environmentalists. </P>

<P>A lot of corporations have lobbyists too.  But is that bad?  Who benefits when
corporate America prospers?  Millions of working men and women who have invested
their pensions in mutual funds which depend on America being profitable to
increase in value, among others. </P>

<P>It is true that some causes don't have sufficient voice in the process.  The
answer is more people fighting for more special interests.  Not less. </P>

10:34:02 1996 <BR>Subject: But . . .  </P>

<P>While I don't disagree with some of what Mr. Boggs says in the above, there are
a couple of nagging problems here.  First, while it is certainly true that one
man's "lobbying" is another's constitutionally-protected "petitioning the
government for redress," the fact is that the profusion of lobbying activity has
led to a perception of the government as, in effect, selling law to the highest
bidder.  I think I'd take issue with the statement that "the answer is more
people fighting for more special interests."  Madison warned us a long time ago
about the danger of "faction" in a democratic society -- the sum of "special
interests" does not equal the "public interest" (which is, supposedly, the
constituency that lawmakers are charged with serving).  There's also a question
about the role of lawyers in all of this.  The perception of lawyers as "hired
guns," prepared to make *any* arguments for which clients will pay them, is
widespread.  Now, in the context of many kinds of representation, lawyers can
legitimately say that they really *must* do that -- for example in the context
of defending an accused criminal, where (a) society has determined that someone
needs to hold the prosecutor's feet to the fire and force the government to
prove its case, and (b) we believe that the "truth" will only come out in the
context of an adversarial process where each side makes the best arguments it
can.  But in the public policy/lobbying context, it doesn't seem that either of
these rationales apply. To many observers, this looks like a misuse of lawyerly
skills, using the ability to persuade that is so useful and important in the
adversarial context, for very different purposes.  Your thoughts? David Post  </P>

<P>Although you are closely associated with the trial lawyers, a longtime products
liability lobbyist once told me that you would have been just as happy to
represent the other side of the issue -- it was all a matter of who hired you
first. Obviously, a good lawyer/lobbyist can argue any side of any issue. But 1.
are you a more effective lobbyist if you personally believe in the side you are
arguing? and  2. are there any clients -- barring those that are banned because
of conflicts -- that you would or have refused in the past? </P>

<P>thanks. </P>

21:01:01 1996 <BR>Subject: But . . . </P>

<P>I'll respond to Ted's question first, because David's question requires
additional thought.  Have we ever turned down a potential client?  Yes.  Some
examples.  When the government of South Africa attempted to hire Patton Boggs
during apartheid, we said no.  When a young associate (now partner) was asked to
represent the "adult entertainment" industry before Congress, we decided to take
a pass.  There are other examples, but I think you get the point. </P>

<P>Am I more effective when I believe in the client's cause?  Of course.  But if
you view legislative representation in the same manner as advocacy before a
court of law, then each client is entitled to a vigorous advocate.  Luckily, I
seldom find myself in the position of representing clients whose causes I find
distasteful. </P>

<P>Wow.  I admire the alliteration in your "profusion of perceptions",  but I have
to take issue with the accuracy of some of them. </P>

<P>The perception that legislative advocacy amounts to a mere "selling of the law"
is a common stereotype which suggests that Members of Congress, democratically
elected, can be bought and sold.  In my experience, nothing could be further
from the truth.  Although the modern media has tended to reduce politics to a
collection of sound bites, the vast majority of our elected officials are
honest, hard-working, public servants who suffer as we lobbyists do from this
kind of cynical assessment.   </P>

<P>As for your observation that the sum of "special interests" do not make up the
"public interest," I can only respond, "What other index of the public's
interest does one have than the petitions of organized groups of motivated and
interested citizens placed before democratically-elected officials?"  Should we
attempt to govern by social science survey?  I doubt Madison would approve of
that, either.  I do know that he approved of representative government and the
system of checks and balances that protects those who are least able to
represent themselves from the tyranny of any majority.  The right of petition,
like the existence of a free press, is part of the design of that system. </P>

<P>As for your indictment of lawyers as "hired guns" who commonly make "any
argument" with impunity, it is another bit of cynicism to which I cannot
subscribe.  As a lobbyist, if I make "any" argument to Congresswoman X, no
matter what the consequences to her in terms of public reaction, I certainly
will never be invited back into her office when the fact becomes known.  Common
sense and professional survival therefore dictate that I tell her the truth,
plain and simple.  Moreover, skilled professional advocacy has as rightful a
place in legislative practice as it does in any legal arena.  And Constitutional
rights and other legal privileges are just as subject to challenge in Congress
as in a court of law, if not more so.  It is not a misuse of lawyers' skills to
use them on Capitol Hill. </P>

<P>OK, OK -- thanks for your reply to my [overbearing? overheated?] posting -- and
I certainly don't want to appear to be berating you on any of this.  But this is
-- as you certainly know and appreciate -- important stuff, important both for
the profession and for how our society works.  So -- taking your thoughtful
reply to indicate that you don't mind (or even enjoy?) engaging in these
questions, let me push -- lightly, I promise -- a little further. </P>


<P>I do not disagree with your characterization of Members of Congress as generally
honest and hard-working.  But that does not mean they are not bought and sold --
not through illegal means (e.g., bribery) but legal means (campaign
contributions and the "access" that money can, in fact, buy).   Now, you write
that "Moreover, skilled professional advocacy has as rightful a place in
legislative practice as it does in any legal arena."  Precisely where we
disagree.  If Members were, in fact, acting like "judges" -- listening to all
arguments on various sides of public policy issues and then trying to find the
one that best serves the public interest -- advocacy of this kind might be a
good thing.  But that is not, in my experience, what they do.  I've had exposure
to this recently in regard to efforts to modify the Copyright Act.  There's
enormous lobbying activity by many of the discrete interests affected by the
bill -- publishers, the copyright collectives (ASCAP, etc.), the Hollywood
community, etc.  But there is a broad public interest that is really not
considered -- because most people have only the tiniest stake in what happens to
the copyright act, there's no mechanism for their voice to be heard as part of
this debate.  Now, sometimes there's a "special interest" that may be broadly
enough constituted that it stands in for the public -- in the copyright case,
the librarians often function this way.  But often that's not the case.  If the
legislative process is about advocacy for specific interests, there are
structural reasons for thinking that one of the "parties" doesn't have
representation.  Isn't that something people should be concerned about? David   </P>

<P>In your response to David Post, you ask: "What other index of the public's
interest does one have than the petitions of organized groups of motivated and
interested citizens placed before democratically-elected officials?"  </P>

<P>How about the general public interest in a decision making process that brings
all points to bear on public policy debates. Surely, as an advocate for a
particular cause, you would be happy if your position prevailed with minimal
debate or with the members' having limited awareness of opposing arguments. Yet,
from the perspective of the community as a whole, that process -- and it's
substantive outcomes would not be best. </P>

<P>Have you seen Sandel's piece in the Atlantic a month or so ago about the need to
rediscover a sense of "civic" virtue (along the lines of perceiving a public
interest in debating issues from a point of view that values civility and shared
search for truth)? Any reactions to it? </P>

<P>More generally, if you were to adopt (hypothetically, only, perhaps) this
"public interest" point of view, how would you change our current process to
assure, structurally, more systematic canvassing of the views of dispersed
interests? </P>

<P>This is a terrific dialogue and one that points up the fundamental tension
between democracy and distrust.  The real issue is how do we, as a democratic
society, preserve democracracy that's awash in a sea of undemocratic
institutions and forces.  The institutions that Mr. Boggs and others represent
are by their nature undemocratic.  Firms, corporations and many foreign states
are hierarchical, despotic and exist not to preserve democratic values, but to
subvert them to their own ends, i.e. making money. This means trying to
circumvent environmental, tax, trade and safety and health laws that put a drag
on profits.  While folks certainly benefit from profitability, at what cost to
democracy, at what cost to society?  Perhaps these questions should be
emblazoned on the doorways to the House and Senate, just in case lobbyist and
others forget what's really important.  </P>

15:41:22 1996 <BR>Subject: Anyone can get representation </P>

<P>In David Post's response, he suggests that professional advocacy does not have a
rightful place in the legislative arena because some interests have no voice in
the process.  I disagree.   You think some interests have no voice.  I think
they simply lack substantial interest in the particular issue at stake. </P>

<P>You selected the example of the copyright bill.  Take the ASCAP/BMI issue to
which you refer.  (For those readers who are -- probably thankfully -- unaware
of the issue, the ASCAP issue is a fight over licensing fees between the music
copyright licensing associations and businesses which play copyrighted music as
background noise.)   Is there really a big public interest in that issue which
lacks representation? </P>

<P>The music licensing associations believe that they should be able to charge
restaurants, bowling alleys and movie theatres licensing fees for background
music even if that music is broadcast over a radio station which has already
paid once for the right to use the copyrighted music.  The current law supports
them.  The business establishments argue that music is not their business --
hamburgers, bowling and movies are their business.  They would like to see the
law changed. </P>

<P>In this scenario I presume that the unrepresented "public interest" would be the
consumers who frequent these establishments.  But would bowlers really care if
they knew that they pay, indirectly, a couple pennies a year to have background
music while they bowl?  It just isn't a big enough issue to get worked up about.</P>


<P>But those same bowlers might be represented on other issues more important to
them.  Perhaps they care deeply about their religious beliefs.  Chances are,
their church or synagogue is part of a religious denomination with very
sophisticated representation in Washington.  Those bowlers are consumers, and
may have joined an organization like the Consumer Federation of America, or
supported through subscriptions a group like Consumers Union.  Those two
organizations have some of the most talented lobbyists in Washington.  Those
bowlers may have a little money in a retirement account.  That account is
probably invested in mutual funds.  The funds are made up of corporations, among
others.  Both the mutual funds and the corporations probably have Washington
lobbyists fighting hard to improve their bottom line, so that the fund can
perform better, and our bowlers pensions can grow!  Maybe the bowlers are
retirees who belong to the AARP or the National Alliance for Senior Citizens,
two more groups with suburb organizational skills here in Washington.  I think
you get the point.  Our bowlers have a lot of influence. </P>

<P>My response to David Johnson's comment is similar.  What is the "public
interest" on any given issue?    I would be much more worried with a system
where policy makers would try to divine in a vacuum what the "civic virtue"
should be.  We have a representative democracy so that people, with interests,
can tell their elected representives what they want them to do.  Don't trust
your government.  Trust the people. </P>

<P>I also disagree that a "more systematic canvassing of views" would make for
better policy making.  Should we legislate by opinion survey?  If individuals
REALLY care about a particular issue, they will join together with like minded
individuals and petition their government.  Why should elected officials believe
that their constituents really care about an issue just because some couch
potatoes answered the phone one night and responded to an opinion survey? </P>

<P>I agree with you that surveys are inferior to informed and interested dialogue.
(that's not what I meant by systematic canvassing, but the inadequate expression
was my own.) </P>

<P>And there may or may not be a discernible public interest "on any given issue". </P>

<P>But you didn't fully engage my question, which was: does the public's interest
in having policy questions decided optimally, from the perspective of the group
as a whole, suggest any changes in our current system. </P>

<P>I understand that you argue that representation of those who care deeply enough
to form a group to hire a lobbyist is a good proxy for the intensity of their
concerns. But doesn't that systematically disserve the real but not critical
interests that people have in things that don't affect them so centrally that
they can or will mobilize. Doesn't your position mean anyone can get away with
stealing a few cents (or a few utils) from everyone, because the transaction and
information costs of mobilizing in opposition are just too high to allow any
counterattack? </P>

<P>You are persuasive on the need to make a contrary case by showing a practical
alternative that doesn't simply empower those who purport to speak for some
ephemeral "public interest" to impose their own will. But there may be such an
alternative: a representative, deliberative body access to which is not
preferentially given to those willing to spend (or raise as a group and spend)
substantial sums of money. </P>

<P>I sense your response to this will be that such a body cannot exist -- because
factions will raise and spend money on those issues that are important enough to
them, no matter what structural reforms we might make. So we might as well relax
and enjoy it. But Federalist No. 10 suggests the contrary -- that structural
changes could limit the impact of factions by making it harder for those who
share specific interest to find each other, by making it harder for them to
reach the representatives, etc. </P>

<P>As a thought experiment, let's suppose that we walled off each Congress from
contact with the outside world after it convenes and until it adjourns. Should
make it harder to spend money to influence the debate. Doesn't, to be sure,
prevent lots of other forms of influence. But is it a good idea, or bad? And
why? </P>

<P>Not to beat a dead horse, but -- my point is precisely the one you make, that
the bowlers don't care as much about this issue as do either the ASCAPs of the
world or the bowling industry.  That's why we have mohair subsidies -- because
mohair growers (do you 'grow' mohair??) care *a lot* and consumers don't care
very much about the penny or two additional they pay.  So Members of Congress
see this as a debate between ASCAP and the Bowling Alley Association of America,
or between the domestic mohair producers and the mohair importers.  Congress in
theory is supposed to choose those policies that maximize the general welfare --
but they see themselves as only choosing between those groups that have a
pre-eminent economic stake, without really considering the small individual
stakes -- those individuall pennies that you and I pay -- that may add up to a
BIG number. David </P>

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
<BR><BR>
Plaintiff,
<BR><BR>
v.

OLIN CORPORATION,
<BR><BR>
Defendant.</B>
<BR><BR>
CIVIL ACTION NO. 95-0526-BH-S
<BR>
<PRE>
ORDER

The United States filed this action under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601,
et seq., against defendant Olin Corporation ("Olin"), a Virginia corporation
which owns and operates a chemical plant in McIntosh, Alabama, in southwest
Washington County, approximately 25 miles east of the Mississippi state line and
75 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. With the complaint, the parties filed a
proposed consent degree. This court requested the parties to brief certain
statutory and constitutional issues relating to CERCLA. For the reasons stated
below, this court has determined that rather than signing the consent decree, it
must dismiss the action both because 1) Congress did not clearly express its
intent that the liability provision of CERCLA be retroactive, as required by
Landgraf v. USI Film Products,___ U.S.___ , 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229
(1994) and 2) the application of CERCLA, at least on the facts of this case,
violates the Commerce Clause as interpreted in United States v. Lopez, 514
U.S.___, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). 


I. THE COMPLAINT AND PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE 

A. The Olin Property in the Complaint

In its complaint, the Justice Department alleges that the Olin plant site in
McIntosh, comprising 1,500 acres, contains two actionable sites. This action
concerns only the first of two sites at the Olin property. "Site 1"[1] includes
20 acres on the southern edge of the property, on which an active
chemical-production facility operates. This site contains a number of "solid
waste-management units," both active and inactive, many of which have been
closed and treated for the removal of hazardous substances.[2] To the north and
northwest of the active chemical production facility are undeveloped tracts of
land. To the west of the facility is a brine-well field. Four thousand feet east
of the main plant area is a steep bluff which defines the edge of Site 2,[3] the
natural basin.4 

The government alleges that in 1952 Olin Mathieson began operating a
mercury-cell chloralkali plant on Site 1 which generated and released wastewater
containing mercury into Site 2 until 1974. This plant ceased operating in
1982.[5] In 1955, on Site 1, Olin Mathieson built a "crop-protection-chemicals"
plant which discharged wastewater into Site 2 until 1974. This plant also ceased
operating in 1982.[6] As a result of the operation of these two plants (1950's -
late 1982), mercury and chloroform, which are alleged to be hazardous substances
under 42 U.S.C. Section 9601(14), were released into Site 1. 

Most of the alleged contamination resulting from the operation of these two
plants occurred prior to the effective date of CERCLA, December 11, 1980.[7]
However, to the extent that both of these plants also operated after CERCLA's
enactment, i. e., from December 11, 1980, until late 1982, and to the extent
that a threat of continuing releases at and from Site 1 continues, as the
government alleges,8 the government also seeks to recover CERCLA cleanup costs
from Olin for post-enactment conduct. 

In 1978, the company (whose name changed that year to Olin Corporation) built a
diaphragm-cell caustic-soda/chlorine plant which it currently operates. There is
no allegation in the complaint that the operation of this plant has any
connection with the contaminants found on Site 1. 

The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") listed the Olin plant site on the
"national priorities list" in September 1984. Cf. 42 U.S.C. Section 9605; 40
C.F.R. Part 300. 

The complaint indicates that Olin conducted a "remedial investigation" of Site
1, completed in July 1993, and then a "feasibility study" of proposed responses
to contamination at Site 1, completed in February 1994. In December 1994, the
EPA executed its "record of decision" based on the remedial investigation and
the feasibility study. The record of decision provides a remedy for the
contamination of the alluvial aquifer which the agency contends is consistent
with CERCLA and the national contingency plan. 

For present purposes, the court accepts the allegations of the complaint as true
and notes, in fairness; that Olin's answer admits many, while denying some, of
them. For example, the defendant admits that there have been releases in the
past, but denies that there is any threat of future release of hazardous
substances. The defendant also denies any imminent and substantial danger to the
public health or welfare, or the environment, because of actual or threatened
releases from Site 1. 


B. The Proposed Consent Decree and Remedial-Investigation Report 

With the complaint, the Justice department filed a proposed consent decree,9
which both parties had signed. The government published notice thereof in the
Federal Register to afford the public opportunity for comment. 603 Fed. Reg.
36309, 36309-10 (1995). When the government received no comment within 30 days,
the parties jointly moved for the court to enter the consent decree. See 42
U.S.C. Section 9622(d)(2). 

The consent decree runs to 71 pages. It makes the defendant, its officers,
directors, and anyone else associated with the defendant, liable for everything
even remotely associated with the clean-up of Site 1, including insuring the
automobiles the government uses in fulfilling and supervising the consent
decree. 

Although the EPA estimates the present value of the cost of compliance to Olin
at $10,339,000,[10] the EPA has an almost unconstrained right to amend the
consent decree. Of course, the defendant may appeal, but the defendant must
direct the appeal to the EPA. The propriety of such procedures is beyond the
scope of this inquiry, yet defense counsel has acknowledged that the consent
decree gives the EPA carte blanche over the company treasury. 

Olin has committed itself to performing the actions which the consent decree
specifically requires, regardless of whether the court approves of the decree;11
however, it has sought to do so under the supervision of the Alabama Department
of Environmental Management ("ADEM") rather than under the EPA.12 The ADEM has
sought the same. Twice in May 1994, the ADEM's director wrote to the EPA to
request that the EPA allow the ADEM to implement the record of decision for Site
1 under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 6901 et
seq., and the Alabama Hazardous Waste Management and Minimization Act, Ala. Code
Sections 22-30-1 et sec., rather than CERCLA. In December 1994, the EPA's
regional administrator in Atlanta, Georgia, wrote the ADEM director to convey
the EPA's belief that it would be "premature at this time to defer" to the ADEM.
The regional administrator stated that accepting the state's proposal would
require modifying a permit under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
which would "add this additional layer of involvement and federal resources to
the already complex situation." He further asserted that "continued
implementation under CERCLA insures consistency and decreases the potential for
conflict."13 Be that as it may, consistency and the decreased potential for
conflict are not necessarily synonymous with constitutionality. 

Four days after rejecting the ADEM's request, the EPA issued its record of
decision, the major portions of which require Olin to (1) pump and treat
additional ground water, (2) upgrade and extend the existing caps over closed
portions of Site 1, (3) increase monitoring of ground water, and (4) establish
certain institutional controls.14 

When the court inquired at oral argument why the defendant negotiated a
settlement and entered into this "consent" decree, counsel for the defendant
responded that it was "a pragmatic business judgment." It believed that "the
fastest and most expedient way to get the work performed would be to simply go
along with what the EPA sought here."15 Olin wanted to complete the work and
went along despite reservations about its legality16 and despite the
government's rigid dictation of the terms and conditions it would accept.17 

In addition to the consent decree, the government filed18 a
remedial-investigation report, prepared by Woodward-Clyde Consultants of Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, in July 1993. The report documents remedial-investigation
activities under an amended work plan and was completed under EPA supervision
and ultimately with EPA approval. The objectives of the remedial investigation
were (1) to investigate the nature, lateral extent, and vertical extent of
contamination in order to ascertain the types, concentrations, and distributions
of waste in all potentially affected media, such as the air, groundwater, soil,
surface water, and sediment; (2) to determine the potential of the wastes to
migrate beyond Site 1 and Site 2; and (3) to assess the current and potential
risk to public health, welfare, and the environment.19 Shortly after the
government filed the remedial-investigation report, the parties jointly informed
the court that they neither needed nor desired further discovery in this
action.20 

According to the remedial-investigation report, any contaminants still at Site 1
affect groundwater there mostly by migrating through the alluvial aquifer. This
aquifer lies atop a miocene aquifer.21 The remedial-investigation report
indicates that there is little or no migration between the aquifers. The
potential does exist for minimal migration along the casing of an enormous well
on Site 1; e.g., if the well were to develop a leak in the casing and/or a
rupture in the annular seal. If so, the potential concentration of contaminants
not only would be localized around the well, but also negligible because the
amount of water removed by this well is so great. 

Wells established around the site to contain any outward flow of contaminants
monitor the alluvial aquifer. Nothing shows that the alluvial aquifer carries
water across any state lines or into any river or other transportation source
that would take it across any state lines, nor is there any indication of
transport of contaminants through the air across state lines.22 

Indeed, the record reflects that any contamination at Site 1 is of such minimal
proportions as not to constitute any hazard to the public. As stated in the EPA
Record of Decision: 

The risk assessment indicates that only risks associated with potential future
on-site resident exposures to contaminated groundwater and surface soils would
not be within EPA's acceptable risk range. The chemicals of concern would pose
unacceptable risks if the on-site groundwater were used as a source of potable
water or if children living on the site were exposed to contaminated surface
soils. Future use of this site as a residential area is considered unlikely and
thus the proposed remedial goals are directed at protecting the groundwater for
its maximum beneficial use.23 


C. REVIEW OF THE CONSENT DECREE

Notwithstanding the initial willingness of the defendant to enter into a
"consent" decree, this court has a duty to examine a consent decree not only to
determine whether its factual and legal determinations are reasonable, but also
to ensure that the decree does not violate the Constitution, a federal statute,
or the controlling jurisprudence. E.g., Howard v. McLucas, 871 F.2d 1000, 1008
(11th Cir.) (citing United States v. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435, 441 (5th Cir.
1981) (Rubin, J., concurring); Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330-31 (5th
Cir. 1977)), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1002, 110 S.Ct. 560, 107 L.Ed. 2d 555
(1989). The court, therefore, has made two requests for briefs, the first of
which directed the parties to brief whether CERCLA, as applied in this case, is
consistent with the Supreme Court's view of the Commerce Clause as recently
explained in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S.___, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d
626 (1995). While both parties have responded to this issue, the defendant has
also raised the issue of CERCLA's retroactivity. The defendant contends that
Congress did not intend for CERCLA to be retroactive and that if it did, CERCLA
violates the Due Process Clause and unconstitutionally delegates legislative
power to the EPA. As a result of further direction from the court by order of
December 29, 1995, the Justice Department has responded to the defendant's
claims concerning retroactivity. 

A frequently reaffirmed principle dictates that a court avoid deciding a
constitutional issue if a case can be disposed of on non-constitutional grounds.
See, e.g., Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688,
711 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Therefore, before considering the several
constitutional issues, this court first addresses the statutory question of
whether Congress intended to make CERCLA retroactive. 


II. CERCLA and Retroactivity

Although the retroactivity of CERCLA has been the subject of holdings in other
circuits, the tissue has not been squarely addressed by the Eleventh Circuit. In
dicta, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit recently referred to CERCLA as being
retroactive. Virginia Properties Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 74 F.3d 1131, 1132 (11th
Cir., 1996). The issue of retroactivity, however, was not before at court.24 In
another CERCLA case before this court recently, the parties failed to raise the
issue of CERCLA'S retroactivity, see Redwing Carriers, Inc. v. Saraland
Apartments., LTD, 875 F. Supp. 1545 (1995); in its decision, however, this court
refused to apply certain regulations retroactively. 875 F. Supp. at 1565 ("Since
there is no such clear intent in FIFRA, see, e.g., 7 U.S.C. Secs. 136a(a),
136a(d)(2), 1361, the court declines to apply registration cancellation
retroactively.") 

Of those federal decisions which have directly addressed the issue of CERCLA's
retroactivity, 25 none have declined to apply CERCLA on retroactivity grounds.
Nevertheless, all of those cases were decided before the Supreme Court's
decision in Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., ___U.S.___, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (1994), on
which the defendant rests its argument against retroactivity.26 


A.

The Justice Department has responded somewhat cavalierly to the issue of
CERCLA's retroactivity, contending the matter is "well settled" and unaffected
by Landgraf: 

Every court to face CERCLA retroactivity challenges has rejected the arguments
advanced here. Indeed, courts have uniformly held that (1) Congress clearly and
unequivocally intended retroactive application of CERCLA and; (2) such a
liability scheme is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
The Supreme Court's decision in Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 114 S. Ct. 1483
(1994) announces no new constitutional rules, and in no way impacts this case
law. 

See P1's Mem. on the Retroactivity of CERCLA and Due Process Issues, p. 2. To
begin with, Justice errs in claiming that the lower federal courts have
"uniformly held that (1) Congress clearly and unequivocally intended retroactive
application of CERCLA." In fact, not all the courts which have applied CERCLA to
pre-enactment conduct have agreed that it is retroactive,27 and those which have
actually analyzed the retroactivity issue have differed on whether Congress was
acting "clearly and unequivocally."28 More importantly, Justice's observation
that Landgraf "announces no new constitutional rules" fails to assist this court
with what is a significant non-constitutional decision.29 Written against the
backdrop of several constitutional issues, the Landgraf holding addresses a rule
of statutory construction. Justice cannot credibly contend that "[t]he result in
Landgraf is unremarkable."30 It is understandable that Justice would attempt to
dismiss Landgraf so casually. 31 Landgraf certainly demolishes the interpretive
premises on which prior cases had concluded CERCLA is retroactive. Landgraf does
so in the course of attempting to clarify confusion regarding the interpretive
rules applicable to retroactivity: 

Our precedents on retroactivity left doubts about what default rule would apply
in the absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisions
might apply to cases arising before enactment while others might not. Compare
Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493
(1988) with Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40
L.Ed. 2d 476 (1974). 

Landgraf, 114 S.Ct. at 1495. In reaffirming the traditional presumption against
retroactive legislation, Landgraf disapproves language in Bradley which had
appeared to reverse that traditional presumption. 

Bradley allowed an award of attorneys' fees for work done prior to the effective
date of the statute providing for attorneys' fees. The Supreme Court stated it
was doing so "on the principle that a court is to apply the law in effect at the
time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice
or there is a statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary." 416
U.S., at 711, 94 S.Ct., at 2016. The applicability of this language was severely
limited by Landgraf: 

Although the language suggests a categorical presumption in favor of application
of all new rules of law, we now make it clear that Bradley did not alter the
well-settled presumption against application of the class of new statutes that
would have genuinely "retroactive" effect. 

Landgraf, 114 S.Ct. at 1503 (emphasis in the original). 

An early and influential case finding CERCLA retroactive, Ohio v. Georgeoff, 562
F.Supp. 1300 (N.D. Ohio, 1983), did exactly what Landgraf disapproves. Georgeoff
began quite appropriately by "initially determin[ing] the standard to be applied
in determining whether a statute should be applied retroactively." 562 F. Supp.
at 1306. While it acknowledged an "historical[] . . . presumption favoring a
prospective only application of a statute",32 the court otherwise approved of33
and seemed to apply a presumption in favor of retroactivity. The premises for
the decision in Georgeoff were disapproved in and are no longer tenable after
Landgraf. As a result, Georgeoff and the cases which rely on its analysis, --
and which do not do their own analysis -- cannot be considered persuasive. 

Besides Georgeoff, only two other cases actually do analyze the issue of
retroactivity; the rest of the cases basically rely on one or more of these
three cases and other cases which cite these cases. Those other two cases which
do their own analyses are United States v. Shell Oil, Co., 605 F. Supp. 1064 (D.
Colo., 1985) and United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co.,
Inc., 810 F.2d 726 (8th Cir., 1986), both of which also cite Georgeoff with
approval. See 605 F. Supp at 1072 and 810 F.2d at 733. Unlike Georgeoff, neither
case explains how it is applying the presumption against retroactivity; but like
Georgeoff, both cases demonstrate little regard for the presumption. Following
an analysis unlike that of Landgraf34 and after quoting Georgeoff, Id. at 1072,
Shell Oil concludes that CERCLA is "unavoidably retroactive." Id. at 1073. It
does so on the basis of CERCLA's "general purpose and scheme."35 Under Landgraf,
however, the fact "that retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate
its purpose more fully . . . is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against
retroactivity." 114 S.Ct. at 1507-8. Other than its discussion of "general
purpose and scheme," Shell Oil does not explain precisely what overrides the
presumption against retroactivity.36  As for Northeastern, on which Justice
relies, the case treats the presumption itself rather lightly, devotes only one
sentence to the statutory language, relies on Shell Oil and Georgeoff among
other cases, and offers one paragraph about the "statutory scheme."37 

It is understandable that, prior to Landgraf, lower federal courts would have
tended to minimize the importance of the presumption against retroactivity given
some Supreme Court precedents. Landgraf reflects the different views on the
Court about whether some of its precedents, in particular Bradley v. Richmond
School Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1969) and a case on
which it relies, Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct.
518, 21 L.Ed. 2d 474 (1969), have been consistent with other Supreme Court
precedents. The dissenting opinion in Landgraf remarks on the majority's
"eagerness to resolve the 'apparent tension' . . . between Bradley v. Richmond
School Bd.... and Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital", 114 S.Ct. at 1508
(Blackmun, J., dissenting)(citations omitted). The concurring opinion simply
says that Bradley and Thorpe " invented an utterly new and erroneous rule." Id.
at 1523 (Scalia, J., concurring). On the one hand, the majority "begin[s] by
noting that there is no tension between the holdings in Bradley and Bowen." Id.
at 149 (emphasis in the original). Later, however, the majority isolates and
limits the troublesome language in Bradley, quoted above, which created the
confusion about the strength of the presumption against retroactivity. Whether
Bradley actually is or is not at odds with pre and post-precedent need not
concern this court. It suffices to recognize that, contrary to the assertion by
Justice, Landgraf does at least clarify the analysis of retroactivity and,
therefore, does "impact this case."38 


B.

The majority opinion in Landgraf sets forth an analysis which, as here
summarized, requires a court 1) to determine a) whether Congress has expressly
stated the statutes reach and b) if not, whether the text and legislative
history have "clearly prescribed" Congress' intent to apply the provision
retroactively; 2) if not, to determine whether the provision actually has
"retroactive effect on the party or parties in the litigation;" and 3) if so, to
apply the traditional presumption against retroactivity -- absent a clear
congressional intent to the contrary. 

The majority opinion's approach breaks down as follows: 

1) In the last sentence of Part II of the opinion, the majority says: "Our first
question, then, is whether the statutory text...manifests an intent that the
1991 Act should be applied to cases that arose and went to trial before its
enactment." 114 S.Ct at 1492. What follows in Part III of the opinion, 114 S.Ct.
at 1493-96, is an analysis of the arguments based on the text and legislative
history. At the end of this section, the majority determines: "[i]n the absence
of the kind of unambiguous directive found in Sec. 15 of the 1990 bill [which
explicitly provided for retroactivity], we must look elsewhere for guidance on
whether Sec. 102 applies to this case." 114 S.Ct at 1496. 

2) Part IV of the opinion, 114 S.Ct at 1496-1505, discusses the presumption
against retroactivity. The majority notes the "'apparent tension'" between the
different canons of construction found in Bradley as opposed to other Supreme
Court precedents. Id. at 1496. The Court concludes this section with the
following framework for analysis: 

When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the
court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the
statutes' reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort
to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express
command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive
effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,
increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect
to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively,
our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear
congressional intent favoring such a result. 

Id. at 1505. (emphasis added).

3) In Part V of the opinion, 114 S.Ct. 1505-1508, the majority "ask[s] whether,
given the absence of guiding instructions from Congress, Sec. 102 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1991 is the type of provision that should govern cases arising
before its enactment." 114 S.Ct. at 1505. They find the new damages remedy to
have a retroactive effect and conclude it "is the kind of provision that does
not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear
congressional intent," 114 at 1506. The section proceeds without reconsidering
its earlier discussion of congressional intent -- other than to reject as
insufficient to overcome the presumption against retroactivity the argument that
"retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more
fully" 114 S.Ct. at 1507 (footnote omitted) -- to conclude that they "have found
no clear evidence of congressional intent that Sec. 102 of the Civil Rights Act
of 1991 should apply to cases arising before its enactment." 114 S.Ct. at 1508. 

In the framework of analysis as quoted above in 2), the first step involves only
a determination of whether Congress has made an express statement concerning
retroactivity; other evidence of "clear congressional intent" is left to step
three. In the opinion itself, however, the Court considers both express and
other evidence of congressional intent in the first step. As reflected from the
quotes from Parts II and III of the opinion, see 1), the Court does not clearly
differentiate between express language and other clear language of intent from
the statute or legislative history. While it does not seem to matter whether the
discussion of intent is confined to step one or divided between step one and
step three, the analysis here follows what Landgraf in fact does. 


1. Has Congress expressed its intent on CERCLA retroactivity? 

CERCLA contains no language explicitly stating it is retroactive.39 Under
language in some Supreme Court opinions, that failure would be fatal for
retroactivity. United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 414 (1806). (Cushing, J.)
("[I]t [is] unreasonable in my opinion, to give the law a construction which
would have such a retrospective effect, unless it contained express words to
that purpose.") While Landgraf demonstrates a preference for express language
regarding retroactivity40 and seems to warn Congress about the danger of not
being explicit,41 its discussion of other (i.e., non-express) statutory language
and legislative history establishes that these should be considered in
determining congressional intent. 


a) Non-Express Statutory Language.

In resolving retroactivity issues, Landgraf instructs that the answer may vary
among provisions within an act. and 1505. Accordingly, the analysis focuses on
the particular provisions of CERCLA, at issue in the complaint, Sections
106(a)42 and 107(a).43 Under Section 106(a) the government seeks injunctive
relief in the first claim of the complaint. Although injunctive relief is
ordinarily prospective, when it requires a party to spend funds related to
actions taken prior to CERCLA's enactment, such relief is nevertheless
retroactive. See Georgeoff 562 F. Supp. at 1303-05. Thus to the extent that the
government's claims under 106(a) and 107(a) relate to actions taken prior to the
effective date of CERCLA, they involve the issue of retroactivity. 

The Justice Department devotes little attention to statutory language as
evidence of congressional intent. To the extent it does, Justice's brief relies
on Northeastern's observation that "[t]he language used in the key liability
provision, CERCLA Section 107 ... refers to actions and conditions in the past
tense." Northeastern, 810 F.2d at 733. Georgeoff, after a more extensive
analysis, finds the use of the past tense not dispositive. 44 Even while finding
other terms supportive of retroactivity, Georgeoff states that the statutory
provisions are insufficient to overcome the presumption of retroactivity. 

Despite these statutory arguments, the Court is unable to declare that the
statute evidences the "imperative character" required to overcome the
presumption against retroactivity. Regardless, these provisions provide some
evidence that Congress intended CERCLA to apply retroactively. The Court,
therefore, will consider these statutory terms as indicia, but not dispositive
indicia, of a Congressional intent to allow retroactive application of CERCLA. 

562 F.Supp. at 1311. Shell Oil agrees with Georgeoff.45 Georgeoff's and Shell
Oil's conclusion that the statutory language in CERCLA is not sufficient to
establish retroactivity is persuasive. Although Northeastern arguably46 reaches
a contrary conclusion, it does so without conducting nearly as extensive an
analysis as done in Georgeoff. This court concludes, therefore, that the
language of section 107 provides "no clear evidence of Congressional intent," as
required by Landgraf, that CERCLA's liability provisions be given retroactive
effect. 

Section 106 contains no language indicating congressional intent to authorize
relief that is retroactive.47 If anything, the language suggests the very
argument, later made by Justice, that CERCLA liability is not "retroactive." The
pertinent language of Section 106 borrows from law on the abatement of nuisance;
it refers to "an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or
welfare or the environment" and provides "such relief as may be necessary to
abate such danger or threat."48 Georgeoff records Justice's unsuccessful attempt
to argue that, although it reaches pre-enactment conduct, legislation designed
to alleviate a continuing public nuisance does not act retroactively." 562. F.
Supp. at 1304. United States v. So. Carolina Recycling and Disposal Inc., 653 F.
Supp. 984 (D. S.C., 1984), on the other hand, adopts that argument.49 As
discussed below, Landgraf now precludes such attempts to avoid the issue of
retroactivity. The fact that in the early cases Justice thought it necessary to
argue, at least in the alternative, that CERCLA is not retroactive certainly
indicates Justice's initial concern that courts might not find a clear
congressional intent that CERCLA be applied "retroactively." 


b) Legislative History.

CERCLA itself has almost no legislative history. 

Although Congress had worked on "Superfund" cleanup of toxic and hazardous waste
bills, and on parallel oil spill bills for over three years, the actual bill
which became Public Law No. 96-510 had virtually no legislative history at all,
because the bill which became law was hurriedly put together by a bipartisan
leadership group of Senators--with some assistance of their House
counterparts--introduced and passed by the Senate in lieu of all pending
measures on the subject. It was then placed before the House, in the form of a
Senate amendment of the earlier House bill. It was considered on December 3,
1980, in the closing days of the lame duck session of an outgoing Congress. It
was considered and passed, after very limited debate, under a suspension of the
rules, in a situation which allowed for no amendments. Faced with a complicated
bill on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, the House took it, groaning all the way. 

Frank P. Grad, Treatise on Environmental Law Sec. 4A.02[2][a], at 4A-51 (1994).
(footnote omitted) (Hereinafter, "Grad") (emphasis added). 

The unusual lack of legislative history, as reflected by the failure even to
produce a House--Senate Conference Report, is attributable to "[t]he delicate
nature of the compromise" which led to passage, according to the Preface to the
Congressional Research Service Legislative History.50 Much of what passes for
legislative history of CERCLA, therefore, comes from "bills introduced which
contributed to some extent to the final act."51 

In Landgraf, the Supreme Court does consider a prior bill as part of its review
of the legislative history. The Court places some weight on the fact that a bill
vetoed in the previous year had explicitly provided for retroactivity. The
legislative history considered in Landgraf comes not from committee reports, but
from the language of the prior bill itself. The fact that the later enacted
legislation had no such provision prompts the Court to infer: "it seems likely
that one of the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991 version was
an agreement not to include the kind of explicit retroactivity command found in
the 1990 bill," 114 S.Ct. at 1495 (emphasis in the original). 

As acknowledged in Georgeoff, "the precise issue of retroactivity...was not
addressed in Congressional debates," 562 F. Supp. at 1311, including debate on
prior bills. Id. Under Landgraf, that fact would seem to be nearly fatal to any
attempt to overcome the presumption against retroactivity. 

The Justice Department attempts to distinguish CERCLA from the civil rights
statute considered in Landgraf because no bill prior to CERCLA explicitly
provided for retroactivity. See "P1's Mem. on Retroactivity" at 4-5. That fact,
however, does not strengthen the case for retroactivity. It only means that what
Justice and other courts have labeled the legislative history of CERCLA may not
be as clear as was the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act considered in
Landgraf. It still remains for Justice to demonstrate that the legislative
history does contain clear intent of CERCLA'S retroactivity. In attempting to do
so, Justice contends that the "history, as analyzed by the courts, demonstrates
unequivocally that Congress was concerned about past, pre-enactment acts of
disposal." "P1's Mem" at 8. 

The argument of Justice, relying as it does on past cases, fails to overcome the
presumption against retroactivity because those prior cases do not follow the
analysis of Landgraf and because they find clarity in legislative history which
does not exist. Many of the past cases are unclear about two things which are
distinguished in Landgraf: congressional intent and retroactive effect. As
discussed below, Landgraf struggles with the term "retroactive." The majority
excludes certain statutes from the presumption against retroactivity,52
specifically procedural and jurisdictional statutes. See 114 S.Ct. at 1501-02.
Approving of Justice Story's discussion in Society for Propagation of the Gospel
v. Wheller, 22 F. Cas. 756 (No. 12,156) (CCDNH 1814), the majority says: 

A statute does not operate "retroactively" merely because it is applied in a
case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment... 114 S.Ct. at
1499. 

In other words, the fact that legislation might have retroactive effect does not
necessarily mean that Congress clearly intended that it be so applied. . 

In searching the legislative history, some courts have placed weight on sources
that have little no value. As two commentators write: "[t]he available reports
pertaining to prior versions of the legislation are of little value in
interpreting the statute-CERLCA,[sic] as enacted, differed significantly from
previous proposals." Allan J. Topol and Rebecca Snow, Superfund Law and
Procedure Section 1.1. at 5 (St. Paul, West; 1992). 

The most that can be said from the legislative history is that Congress left
many questions, including retroactivity, as open ones to be decided later. Like
Landgraf, the circumstances surrounding passage of CERCLA strongly suggest that
the failure expressly to prescribe the reach of the statute was deliberate on
Congress' part. 

It would have been a simple matter for Congress to have included a provision
within the Act providing that liability would be imposed retroactively. Given
the undoubted Congressional awareness of an existing problem, this omission
takes on special importance. There can be no question that Congress was aware
that the issue of retroactivity could arise. Yet, Congress failed to make this
statement. 

Georgeoff. 562 F.Supp. at 1309.

The political circumstances suggest why there was little actual legislative
history and why Congress left many issues deliberately ambiguous.53 

In 1980, CERCLA emerged from the lame duck session of Congress after President
Carter had been defeated and former Governor Reagan had yet to assume the
presidency. Its language was derived mainly from S. 1480, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.
(1980), a bill that had been reported from the Senate Committee on Environment
and Public Works but that had little hope for passage in its complete form. A
group of approximately 25 to 30 senators, with assistance from House members and
the outgoing Administration (at one point including President Carter himself),
and crafted new legislative language to paper over policy disputes on which
there was no consensus. Because many such disputes remained after these
negotiators finished their deliberations, floor debate in the Senate often
contain rival explanations of the same provisions of CERCLA. 

Alfred R. Light, CERCLA Law and Procedure Compendium (BNA; Washington, D.C.,
1992) at 1-1. 

The circumstances explain why Congress decided not to decide many issues,
leaving them for others -- the EPA and the courts--to decide. The fact that
CERCLA includes a legislative veto, see 42 U.S.C. Section 9655, since determined
to be unconstitutional, see IN5. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77
L.Ed 317 (1983), suggests that members of Congress may not have been as
concerned as they should have been about a number of issues, including
retroactivity, because they assumed incorrectly that -Congress has the power to
"fix it" later without concern about a presidential veto. Whatever the reasons,
the legislative history lacks the clear congressional intent to make CERCLA
liability retroactive. 

Given that the language--express or otherwise--and the legislative
history--broadly and narrowly understood--fail to demonstrate a clear
congressional intent for retroactivity, Landgraf requires that the presumption
against retroactivity be applied if the statute is one to which that presumption
applies. 


2. Does CERCLA Have Retroactive Effect?

Landgraf does not simply ask: is the statute retroactive? Framing the question
that way, as have a number of the lower federal courts, reduces the analysis to
a matter of labeling rather than distinguishing between the effect of the
statute and the intent of Congress as does Landgraf.54 A few of the early cases
manipulate the label "retroactive" apparently as a way of avoiding the issues of
congressional intent and constitutionality. Thus United States v. South Carolina
Recycling Disposal Co., 653 F. Supp. 984 (D.S.C., 1984), aff'd in part and vac.
in part sub nom. United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F.2d 160 (4th Cir., 1988),
cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1106 (1989), concludes that considering pre-enactment
conduct does not make CERCLA liability "retroactive" because the statute
actually imposes liability for the post enactment releases or threatened
releases. Although the Justice Department now contends that CERCLA is clearly
retroactive, early cases reflect that Justice made the argument that CERCLA is
not retroactive. See e.g., Georgeoff 562 F. Supp. at 1304.[55] 

Under the Landgraf's analysis, CERCLA liability certainly has "retroactive
effect" because as applied in this and many other cases it easily falls within
the explanatory language of that term. That is to say, the Justice Department's
attempt in this case to impose liability under Section 107(a) largely on actions
occurring prior to the statute's effective date "would impair rights a party
possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or
impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." 114 S.C. at
1505. What Landgraf said about compensatory damages can be said about the
financial liabilities under CERCLA for pre-enactment conduct: "[t]he new damages
remedy in Sec. 102, we conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to
events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent."
114 S.Ct. at 1506. 


3. Should the Presumption Against Retroactivity be Applied? 

In the third step of the analysis, Landgraf asks "whether, given the absence of
guiding instruction from Congress, the [particular section of the act] is the
type of provision that should govern cases arising before its enactment. The
Court does not ask generally whether the act is retroactive, but focuses on the
particular section. The opinion then distinguishes between a procedural
provision of that section (jury trial right) which would "presumably apply to
cases ... regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred,"56 and its
punitive and compensatory damages provisions. Recognizing that "[r]etrospective
imposition of punitive damages would raise a serious constitutional question",
Id. at 1505, the Court avoids that constitutional question by interpreting the
punitive damages provision not to be retroactive. 57 

The provision "authorizing recovery of compensatory damages is not easily
classified," id., according to the Court, because the conduct itself was already
unlawful--only the remedy was new--and also because compensatory damages are not
punitive. Despite these differences, Landgraf applies the presumption against
retroactivity even to the compensatory damages provision. 

The CERCLA provision, Section 107(a), as applied in this case falls somewhere
between the punitive damage and the compensatory damage provisions considered in
Landgraf. In this case, punitive damages are not sought. Nevertheless, Section
106 does provide for fines for failure to comply with an executive branch
abatement order; such fines are clearly punitive. Section 107(c)(3) also
authorizes punitive, treble damages. The EPA uses the threat of punitive damages
as a negotiating tool.58 Given the very real threat of punitive damages, CERCLA
retroactivity poses very nearly the same "ex post facto" danger referred to in
Landgraf. 114 S. Ct. at 1505-06. According to Landgraf, a provision for punitive
damages should not be construed as retroactive unless the language forces that
conclusion because the court must then confront substantial constitutional
questions which follow. 

Regardless of the threat of punitive damages, retroactive CERCLA liability is
more egregious than the compensatory relief which the Court refused to apply
retroactively in Landgraf. In the instant and many other cases, liability under
CERCLA would require compensation for actions which when taken violated no
federal or state law. At least as to the compensatory damages remedy sought in
Landgraf, it could be said that retroactivity involved no new legal standard
concerning the conduct itself.59 Nevertheless, even on the compensatory damages
issue Landgraf says, "it is the kind of provision that does not apply in the
absence of clear congressional intent." Certainly, under Landgraf principles,
CERCLA liability is the kind that does not apply retroactivity without clear
congressional intent. 

As discussed above, pre-Landgraf cases addressing CERCLA retroactivity are
unreliable. Among these cases, Justice places particular reliance on
Northeastern which characterizes CERCLA as "overwhelmingly remedial and
retroactive" and as having a "backward focus." Such labels only confuse the
issue as explained by Landgraf. Legislation cannot be remedial if the conduct
being "remedied" was lawful at the time of its occurrence. As discussed above,
determining that a statute has "retroactive effect" is only part of the
analysis; by itself, it does not indicate Congress' intent. Northeastern's
statement about CERCLA having a "backward focus," is no more dispositive than a
similar characterization of the compensatory damage provision discussed in
Landgraf. 

Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintessentially
backward-looking. Compensatory damages may be intended less to sanction
wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a mechanism that
affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not "compensate" by distributing
funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particular employers to pay for
harms they caused. The introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also
the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties' planning.


114 S.Ct. at 1506. (emphasis added in first sentence only). Landgraf insists
that in no case "in which Congress had not clearly spoken, have we read a
statute substantially increasing the monetary liability of a private party to
apply to conduct occurring before the statute's enactment." 114 S.Ct. at 1507.
Liability under CERCLA certainly must be in accord with this principle. The fact
that "retroactive application of [this] statute would vindicate its purpose more
fully", as in Landgraf, "is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against
retroactivity." Id. at 1507-08. 

Only one sentence in Landgraf, if taken in isolation, lends any support at all
to Justice's position. Near the end of the opinion, Landgraf says: "Section 102
is plainly not the sort of provision that must be understood to operate
retroactively because a contrary reading would render it ineffective." Id. at
1508 (emphasis in original). Justice's argument boils down to a claim that
CERCLA must be read to be retroactive. 

Without any doubt, in CERCLA Congress is addressing an existing situation as
well as future problems. In this respect, CERCLA certainly has a "backward
focus." It does not follow, however, that the liability provision "must be
understood to operate retroactively because a contrary reading would render it
ineffective." Early on, the Justice Department itself argued, at least in the
alternative, that CERCLA's liability provision need not be interpreted to be
retroactive. See Georgeoff at 1304-1306. Quickly, however, that argument failed,
but ultimately became unnecessary as courts approved of applying CERCLA
retroactively. Citing certain "main policy objectives underlying CERCLA . . .
and the need for a liberal interpretation of the Statute, the courts have
expanded the scope of CERCLA liability well beyond anything that Congress itself
could have envisioned." Allan J. Topol and Rebecca Snow, 1 Superfund Law and
Procedure, Section 1.1 at 6 (West Pub.; St. Paul, Minn. 1992). 

Justice confuses what it, the EPA, and a number of courts consider desirable
with what it can be said Congress clearly intended. Insofar as pre-enactment
releases are concerned, the purpose of CERCLA can be covered through the
Superfund. The EPA, however, has chosen to recover as much as possible from
private parties,60 no doubt in part due to Congress' failure to provide
sufficient resources to pay for cleaning all the sites, even as the need was
thought to be in 1980. See Georgeoff 562 F. Supp. at 131213. While Georgeoff
takes the lack of funding as an indication of congressional intent to make
CERCLA retroactive, Id. at 1313, lack of funding does not render the operation
of the statute itself ineffective in the sense used in Landgraf. 

Landgraf mentions accepted means such as certain taxes and zoning regulations by
which governments "impose burdens on past conduct." 114 S.Ct. at 1499, n.
24.[61] Such means, if not otherwise unconstitutional, allow legislators to
"remedy" past conduct. Legislators can address environmental damage; however,
under the "Takings Clause,"62 "confiscatory regulations ... cannot be newly
legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title
itself, in the restriction that background principles of the State's law of
property and nuisance already place upon land ownership." Lucas v. So. Carolina
Coastal Covn., 505 U.S. 1003, 1029, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992). As
Landgraf observes, the "Takings Clause" is one of several constitutional
provisions which incorporate the anti-retroactivity provisions. 114 S.Ct. at
1497. Of course, agencies and officials at all levels of government generally
would wish to induce or compel particular parties to pay for government
initiatives rather than having to impose a general tax. However, the general
presumption against retroactivity and particular constitutional provisions are
designed to limit, and in some instances to prevent, governments from doing so. 

Ironically, the EPA has resisted the retroactivity principle when it would have
worked in favor of private parties. Under Section 106(b)(2)(A), added in 1986 by
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act ("SARA"), private parties can seek
certain reimbursement from the Superfund.63 The EPA has "adopted the position
that orders issued before the passage of SARA do not provide the petitioner with
a right to reimbursement against the Fund." 2 Superfund Law and Procedure supra
Section 11.1 at 272 (footnote omitted). Courts have generally agreed with the
EPA position. See cases cited in id., n. 7-10. 

Nothing presented in the Justice Department brief or pre-Landgraf cases
concerning the statutory language of CERCLA or its legislative history
demonstrates that Section 107(a) (and/or Section 106(a) as related to it in this
case) is "the sort of provision that must be understood to operate retroactively
because a contrary reading would render it ineffective." 114 S.Ct. at 1508.
Accordingly, this court holds that Section 107(a), and Section 106(a) as linked
to it in this case are not retroactive. 


III. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

The holding that Sections 106(a) and 107(a) cannot be given retroactive effect
resolves much, but not all, of this case. Moreover, because of the court's
statutory interpretation holding, the court need not rule on the due process
constitutional issue, which applies only to pre-enactment conduct. The
complaint, however, covers conduct which, while largely occurring prior to the
effective date of CERCLA in 1980, includes some post-enactment conduct.64 As the
defendant mentions in its brief, the provisions of the consent decree respond
"mostly with respect to waste disposal activities that preceded the enactment of
CERCLA in 1980" (emphasis added). After briefly addressing one constitutional
issue which has been mooted by the court's holding on pre-enactment conduct, the
court considers more fully those constitutional issues which are not limited to
pre-enactment conduct. 


A. Retroactivity and Due Process

Landgraf recognizes the due process and other constitutional concerns lurking in
the background of the interpretive issue of whether Congress intended
retroactive application. See 114 S.Ct. at 1497-98. Such constitutional
considerations seem to have contributed to the Court's confirmation of the
presumption against retroactivity. Yet, with the possible exception of a
punitive damages provision, the Court seems to accept that Congress has the
constitutional power to give a statute retroactive effect if it clearly intends
to do so. Landgraf, 114 S.Ct. at 1499 ("Since the early days of this Court, we
have declined to give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights
unless Congress has made its intent clear." (emphasis added)). Given the court's
statutory interpretation of CERCLA, there is no need to reach the constitutional
validity of retroactive application of CERCLA under the due process clause. 


B. Delegation of Legislative Power

The defendant contends that CERCLA unconstitutionally "delegates to EPA the
basic policy decisions" with "no 'intelligible standard' to guide EPA's
decisions about which contaminated sites pose significant risks and how much
money should be spent to reduce or eliminate such risks." Def.'s Mem. of Law in
Resp. to Ct.'s Ord. of Sept. 19, 1995 at 20-21. This constitutional challenge
attacks CERCLA as generally administered by the EPA. This broader challenge
based on the non-delegation doctrine has not been mooted by the holding that
CERCLA liability cannot be applied retroactively. 

The EPA's decision to apply CERCLA retroactively against private parties
represents one example of what the defendant contends is the unauthorized
exercise of legislative power. One way of understanding the decision in Landgraf
is to view it as applying a specific rule of non-delegation, namely that
Congress cannot leave such a basic legislative decision as a statute's possible
retroactivity to the executive and judicial branches. Both the presumption
against retroactivity and the non-delegation doctrine derive from the more
fundamental doctrine of separation of powers. Thus, Landgraf cites INS v.
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct.2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983), in support of the
proposition that "even the will of the majority does not become law unless it
follows the path charted in Article I, Section 7, cl. 2 of the Constitution."
114 S.Ct. at 1496. Landgraf could also have cited Chadha as to what is
"essentially legislative", namely Congressional "action that [has] the purpose
and effect of altering the legal rights, duties, and relations of persons." 462
U.S. at 952. 

Chadha, which is the first modern case to declare a congressional statute
unconstitutional on clear separation-of-powers grounds, illustrates the
relationship between the general doctrine and particular constitutional
provisions. Chadha declares the one-house legislative veto void because it
violates the bicameralism and the presentment clauses. Following Chadha, a line
of separation-of-powers cases raise various issues, including delegation of
powers and removal from office. See Metro. Washington Airports Author. v.
Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 111 S.Ct.
2298, 115 L.Ed.2d 236 (1991) (invalidating a provision in a federal statute
approving an agreement for the transfer of two Washington-area airports from the
U.S. Department of Transportation to an "Airports Authority," which created a
"Board of Review" consisting of nine members of Congress because it violated
separation of powers either by allowing members of Congress to exercise
executive power or by allowing members of Congress to enact legislation without
complying with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the
Constitution.); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102
L.Ed. 2d 714 (1989) (finding no separation-of-powers violation in a statute
establishing the United States Sentencing Commission as "an independent
commission in the judicial branch of the United States" with removal by the
President of commission members; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 108 S. Ct.
2597, 101 L.Ed. 2d 569 (1988) (finding no separation-of-powers violation in a
statute providing for the appointment of "Independent Counsel" by a panel of
Article III judges and removal only for cause by the Attorney General.); Bowsher
v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L.Ed. 2d 583 (1984) (holding that
the provision in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act giving
executive power to the Comptroller General, who was removable by Congress,
violates separation of powers). 

In Chadha the dissent worried that the Court's decision threatened the "modern
administrative state." See 462 U.S. at 98489. As the post-Chadha cases
summarized above reflect, the Court has not consistently pursued a rigorous
separation-of-powers approach.65 Consequently, the modern administrative state
has not been much disturbed by the line of cases cited above. A rigorous
separation-of-powers approach, which would include a stricter non-delegation
doctrine, would greatly curtail the rule-making authority of administrative
agencies,66 including the EPA.67 By itself, however, a broad non-delegation
constitutional challenge to CERCLA cannot currently succeed. Under present
Supreme Court jurisprudence, "there is no significant 'anti-delegation'
principle which restricts the exercise of the commerce power." John E. Nowak and
Ronald D. Rotunda, Constitutional Law (St. Paul, West; 1995) at 156. 

A year ago, of course, it could have been said that almost nothing restricts
Congress' exercise of the commerce power. In the interim, the jurisprudence has
become unsettled due to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Lopez,
514 U.S.___, 114 S. Ct 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), which, for the first time
in more than fifty years, struck down a congressional statute which regulates
non-state activity68 on grounds that it exceeded Congress' power under the
Commerce Clause. Some of the concerns raised by the defendant under the
non-delegation doctrine overlap with the issues in Lopez, to which this court
now turns. 


C. The Commerce Clause

The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause has expanded greatly
over the better part of the last two centuries. In one pre-Lopez case, a federal
district court described the expansion of that clause as follows: 

To be within the ambit of the Commerce Clause, an activity originally had to be
commerce that moved across state lines. With time, courts began to hold that the
commerce need only affect movement across state lines. Finally, courts dropped
the commerce requirement and applied the Clause to any activity that affects
movement across state lines. The sole remaining limitations on Congress's power
under the Commerce Clause is the requirement that the effect on commerce be
substantial. 

Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service v. Babin, 799 F.Supp. 695, 735 (E.D.
Mich. 1992), aff'd, 18 F.3d. 337 (6th Cir. 1994). 

Since the 1930's the Supreme Court has found very little in the Constitution
that limits Congress' power to justify legislation under the Commerce Clause.
Prior to United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S.___, 114 S.Ct. 1624 (1995), the only
unsettled area appeared to involve the ability of Congress to regulate states
themselves. In National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976) the Court
held that the Commerce Clause did not give Congress power to regulate "the state
as a state."69 A few years later, the Court overturned National League of cities
by its decision in Garcia v. San Antonio 469 U.S. 528 (1985), holding that the
sovereignty of the states does not limit Congress' power under the Commerce
Clause.70 Then, somewhat inconsistently, the Court decided in United States v.
New York, 505 U.S. 144, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992), that the
Constitution does not give Congress power to "[C]ommandeer the legislative
procedure of the states by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a
federal regulatory program." Id. at 2428 (quotation omitted). While the holding
in New York did not rest on the Tenth Amendment, the Court noted that "the Tenth
Amendment confirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits
that may, in a given instance, reserve power to the states." Id. at 2418. The
application of the federalism principles found in New York has remained somewhat
uncertain as reflected in recent federal circuit cases ruling on the Brady
Bill.71 At the same time, however, the Court has recently reaffirmed the
traditional principles of state sovereignty in a case from this circuit,
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,___U.S.___, 116 S.Ct. 1114,___ L.Ed.2d.___
(1996), which rejected the principle that Congress' Commerce Clause power could
be used to overrule a state's sovereign immunity.72 

United States v. Lopez did not involve federal regulation of a state itself.
Rather, the federal gun statute at issue attempted to exercise police power over
matters historically falling within the jurisdiction of local government. In
declaring Congress had exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause in
regulating non-state action, the Court seemed to open up many questions. The
dissenting Justices warned that "the Court's holding threatens legal uncertainty
in an area of law that, until [Lopez], seemed reasonably well settled." Id. at
514 U.S.___, 115 S.Ct at 1664 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The dissenters were
clearly concerned that changes which occurred in landmark cases in the late
1930's and early 40's could be overturned. Id. at 514 U. S.___, 115 S. Ct at
1665. 

Despite the potential for uncertainty, the majority focused on the
Constitution's limits on federal power. They emphasized that the Constitution
does not grant Congress "a plenary police power that would authorize enactment
of every type of legislation." Id. at___, 115 S. Ct. at 1633. While.a few of its
cases had "taken long steps" towards granting such "a general police power of
the sort retained by the states," the Court declined to follow some of the very
broad language which seemed to allow Congress to do virtually anything under the
Commerce Clause. Id. at___, 115 S. Ct. at 1634. 

Any application of Lopez must begin with its reassertion that the Constitution's
enumeration of powers limits federal power, that such enumeration "[does] not
presuppose something not enumerated." Id. at___, 115 S. Ct. at 1634 (citing
Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 195, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824)). 

Since this country's inception, the division of powers between the state and
federal governments has been a constant source of friction. Indeed, that
conflict was considered an important institutional protection for liberty.73
Moreover, federal courts have been considered essential to preserving the
federal state balance.74 Thus, in performing its duty to elucidate the meaning
of the Constitution in such a way as to reconcile prior case law with the
meaning of the Constitution itself,75 the federal courts play an important part
in maintaining federalism. 

Accordingly, this court applies the principle of enumerated powers discussed in
Lopez to the question of CERCLA'S constitutionality. In so doing, this court
finds that, when measured against the "ultimate touchstone of
constitutionality," Graves v. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466, 491-492, 59 S.Ct.595,
603-604, 83 L.Ed. 927 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), the application of
CERCLA to this case exceeds the power given Congress under the Commerce Clause. 


1. The Constitutional Text and Its Original Interpretation 

As stated in Lopez:

We start with first principles. The Constitution creates a Federal Government of
enumerated powers. See U.S. Const., Art. I, Section 8. As James Madison wrote,
"[t]he powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government
are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are
numerous and indefinite." The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961). This constitutionally mandated division of authority "was adopted by the
Framers to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties." Gregory v. Ashcroft,
501 U.S. 452, 458, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 2400, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991)(internal
quotation marks omitted). "Just as the separation and independence of the
coordinate branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation
of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the
States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from
either front." Ibid. 

Lopez, 514 U.S. at___, 115 S.Ct. at 1626 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.J.); see also
Id. 514 U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 1638 (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("It was the
insight of the Framers that freedom was enhanced by the creation of two
governments, not one"). 

Perhaps, "[i]t is easy to lose sight of all this in a day when Congress
appropriates trillion-dollar budgets and regulates myriad aspects of economic
and social life. Nevertheless, there are occasions on which we are reminded of
this fundamental postulate of our constitutional order." United States v. Lopez,
2 F.3d 1342, 1345 (5th Cir. 1993), affid, 514 U.S.___, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131
L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). 


a. Enumerated Powers and the Necessary and Proper Clause 

The Constitution enumerated the powers of Congress in Article I, Section 8,
which begins: "The Congress shall have the Power To...." Then, in the following
eighteen clauses, the text listed the powers given to Congress, including the
Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. 

From the beginning, the import of the necessary and proper clause was
controversial. In the administration of George Washington, Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson argued for a narrow or strict interpretation of the enumerated
powers.76 His views reflected those of the anti-Federalists who had opposed the
Constitution, in large measure from fear of the necessary and proper clause.
They desired a provision like the one in the Articles of Confederation which had
limited the powers of the government to those "expressly" delegated by the
states. The anti-Federalists lost this argument, even when they got the Tenth
Amendment as part of the Bill of Rights, as this amendment failed to use the
term "expressly.77" In opposition to Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton -- following
the Federalist -- argued for a broader interpretation of the enumerated powers,
but nevertheless one within the structural constraints of the Constitution. As
Hamilton had written in The Federalist, no one was proposing an all-powerful
government; only a more powerful central government than that of the Articles of
Confederation.78 

The views of Hamilton and The Federalist found their way into the Marshall
Court, which is hardly surprising since the Court was dominated by Federalists.
The same basic Federalist viewpoint which created the text of the Constitution
also interpreted that text. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's opinions
coincided with The Federalist without ever citing those essays.79 Apparently,
Marshall's point was to derive meaning directly from the text and structure of
the Constitution rather than to rely on a secondary source. 

Marshall's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L.Ed. 579
(1819) is often referred to as giving a broad interpretation of the necessary
and proper clause. In fact, McCulloch demonstrated that the necessary and proper
clause is unnecessary. That is to say, McCulloch first explained how a proper
interpretation of the enumerated powers supports Congress' power to create the
Bank of the United States.80 The fact that Congress did not have the power
generally to create corporations (and still does not attempt to exercise such a
power) did not mean it lacked the power to create a particular corporation as a
means to the exercise of one or more of its clearly enumerated powers. 

The necessary and proper clause in no way expanded the enumerated powers of
Congress;81 it simply left no doubt that Congress has the fullness of those
powers actually granted in the Constitution. McCulloch, therefore, followed the
explanation of the necessary and proper clause as provided in The Federalist,
namely that it is merely "declaratory of a truth, which would have resulted by
necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a
Federal Government, and vesting it with certain specified powers." The
Federalist No. 33, at 159 (George W. Carey and James McClellan eds.,
1990)(arguing further that "the constitutional operation of the intended
government would be precisely the same, if [the Necessary and Proper Clause and
the Supremacy Clause] were entirely obliterated, as if they were repeated in
every article."). See also The Federalist No. 44, at 232 (George W. Carey and
James McClellan eds., 1990)("No axiom is more clearly established in law, or in
reason, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authorized;
wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power
necessary for doing it, is included.")(emphasis added). Echoing this reading of
the text, McCulloch v. Maryland stated, "it may with great reason be contended,
that a government, entrusted with such ample powers, on the due execution of
which the happiness and prosperity of the nation so vitally depends, must also
be entrusted with ample means for their execution." (emphasis added) 17 U.S. (4
Wheat.) 316, 408 (1819). 

In McCulloch, Marshall discussed the relationship between ends and means as
applied to the necessary and proper clause: "Let the end be legitimate, let it
be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist of
the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional." McCulloch, 17
U.S. at 421. According to Chief Justice Marshall, McCulloch represented no
augmentation of the enumerated powers. Writing in defense of the opinion under
the pseudonym "A Friend of the Constitution," Marshall insisted that McCulloch "
does not contain the most distant illusion to any extension by construction of
the powers of congress. Its sole object is to remind us that. a constitution
cannot possibly enumerate the means by which the powers of government are to be
carried into execution."82 McCulloch's statement that we must remember that it
is a constitution we are interpreting was not a justification for departing from
the text, but an indication of how to interpret the text, i.e., not narrowly
like a statute.83 Thus, Marshall stated that a Constitution does not "partake of
a prolixity of a legal code." McCulloch, 17 U.S. at 407. 

The necessary and proper clause is like the Tenth Amendment in that both declare
what the structure of the Constitution already provides As Chief Justice
Marshall and The Federalist say, the necessary and proper clause merely declares
that the powers given to the federal government are given in their fullness. The
clause does not mean -- as anti-Federalists feared -- that Congress can claim
other powers not listed by invoking the necessary and proper clause.
Accordingly, the Tenth Amendment reflects the attempt to quiet what Federalists
at the time considered to be unfounded fears. Thus, "the Tenth Amendment does
not independently provide a substantive limitation on the powers of the United
States. Instead the Tenth Amendment simply makes plain that the federal
government possesses only the powers that have been given to it by the
Constitution--and no more." Koog v. United States, 79 F.3d at 455, (5th Cir.,
1996). 


b. Marshall's Interpretation of the Commerce Clause 

The power referred to as "the Commerce Clause", Article I, Section 8 provides:
"The Congress shall-have Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,
and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." U.S. Const. art. I,
Section 8, cl. 3. "Even to speak of 'the Commerce Clause,' perhaps obscures the
actual scope of that clause because Congress did not have authority to regulate
all commerce; Congress could only regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and
among the several States, and with the Indian' Tribes.'" Lopez, 514 U.S. at___,
n. 2, 115 S.Ct. at 1644 n. 2 (Thomas, J., concurring). 

Five years after McCulloch, Chief Justice Marshall wrote Gibbons v. Ogden, 22
U.S.(9 Wheat.)1, 6 L.Ed.23 (1824) which is the classic analysis of the text of
the Commerce Clause in its fullness.84 He addressed the three questions which
naturally follow from the language of the "power to regulate commerce among the
several states." He discussed: 1) whether the subject of the congressional
legislation is commerce; 2) whether the commerce affects other states; and 3)
whether the legislation regulates the commerce.85 

Neither the text nor Gibbons use the term "interstate." As to the phrase "among
the several states," Gibbons asks whether the commerce affects other states, not
whether some activity affects interstate commerce. The text and Gibbons ask
whether the federal legislation regulates the commerce, not some activity which
affects interstate commerce.86 


2. Deconstruction of the Constitutional Text 

The shift in focus from the text itself to a distinction between interstate and
intrastate commerce came later. Lopez did not discuss specifically this
transformation. The several opinions mentioned in Lopez, however, did relate
that the expanded use of the Commerce Clause began with the Interstate Commerce
Act of 1887, see 115 S.Ct. at 1627, and that in reviewing congressional
legislation, the Court had borrowed, inappropriately as Chief Justice Rehnquist
noted, from its negative or dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence which
pertained to state legislation. Id. 


a. The Influence of the Dormant Commerce Clause 

As is generally recognized, the early dormant commerce clause cases divided
federal and state powers in analytical or categorical terms. In Cooley v. Bd. of
Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia, 12 How. (53 U.S.) 299, 13 L.Ed. 996 (1851),
the Court drew a distinction between those things subject to national regulation
and those subject to local regulation. 87 Such an approach, unlike that of
Marshall,88 was bound to fail. Under this analysis, the Court decided whether
the object of regulation was or was not local. If it was "local", the Court
allowed the state to regulate it; if national, states could not regulate it.
Whatever merit this approach may have to analysis of state regulatory power, 89
its application to federal statutes inappropriately limited Congress. That is to
say, the Court declared in some cases that Congress could not regulate things
that the Court declared were "local." The Court ignored the possibility that
something might be local, in the sense that a state could regulate it, without
being beyond Congress' reach. This approach, epitomized later by Hammer v.
Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251, 38 S.Ct 529, 62 L.Ed. 251 (1918), failed to acknowledge
that both the state and federal governments might regulate the same commerce
because even though it was "local" in a certain sense it was also affecting
other states. 

The faulty framework of analysis adapted from the dormant Commerce Clause then
got mixed in with the confusion between regulating commerce and exercising
police powers -- a distinction critical to Lopez. Beginning in the late 19th
century a dialectual process occurred between the Court and Congress that
expanded Congress' power.90 The process began when Congress attempted to
prohibit transmission by mail or importation of lottery tickets. When this
failed, Congress also prohibited the transportation of lottery tickets across
state lines in the 1895 Lottery Act.91 In Champion v. Ames92 (upholding the
constitutionality of the Lottery Act), the Supreme Court divided over the
question whether regulating the movement of lottery tickets was within
congressional power or within the police power of the states. In upholding the
prohibition, the majority noted that it considered the purpose of the Act
pertinent to the constitutional question. The Court recognized a general police
power in Congress to eliminate evils which threaten the general welfare.93 

The dissent in Champion contended, inter alia, that the prohibition was not
within the necessary and proper power of Congress because, while the "purpose"
of the Act was the suppression of lotteries, the exercise of a general police
power by the Congress conflicted with the powers reserved to the states under
the Tenth Amendment.94 In fact, the Act neither interfered with the police
powers of any state nor represented a general, national police power. As the
dissent itself noted, the Act did not prevent lotteries in states which chose to
legalize them.95 What the Act did was to prevent a seller of lottery tickets in
a state where lotteries were legal from sending those lottery tickets into other
states where lotteries were illegal. As a result of a previous Supreme Court
decision,96 a state on its own authority could not prohibit items from being
mailed into or otherwise transported into its jurisdiction. Thus, regardless of
the congressional motive or the broad dicta in the Champion opinion, the Lottery
Act regulated a matter (cross-border movement of certain commerce) which the
Court's interpretation of the dormant Commerce Clause had placed beyond the
power of the states.97 Champion exemplified Congress' use of the prohibiting
technique to regulate, indeed to prevent, the flow of certain commerce across
state lines.98 

While the dissent in Champion incorrectly argued that Congress' "purpose" made
the statutory prohibition improper, the majority also erred when it suggested
that Congress had the power to prohibit because of its worthy purpose. The Court
should have held that Congress has the power to prohibit the movement of
commerce across state lines regardless of purpose.99 Had this been made clear,
the Court might not have later struck down the child labor laws in Hammer v.
Dagenhart100 based on what the majority considered to be an improper purpose.
After Champion, however, the power to prohibit seemed to turn on the purpose.101
Indeed, members of Congress read Champion as positing a national police power
premised upon purpose.102 

Having facilitated the transformation of Congress' regulatory power into an
implied national police power, the Court later cut back on Congress' clearly
constitutional powers. In Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Court invalidated the
congressional prohibition of the interstate transportation of goods made using
child labor. The decision departed from Champion and other cases in that it
denied Congress the power to prohibit the shipment of certain goods across state
lines. The Court, however, was consistent with prior cases in the sense that, as
in Champion and other cases, the decision turned on congressional purpose.103 

Even Franklin Roosevelt's Justice Department viewed Champion and other "police
power" cases in one category, set apart from the regulation of commerce.104 The
Roosevelt administration initially avoided the prohibiting commerce technique in
favor of other forms of regulation based on the "affecting commerce" and "in
commerce" rationales. After the Supreme Court made its famous 1937 course
correction in N.L.R.B. v. Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U.S. 1, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81
L.Ed 893 (1937), Congress employed both the commerce-prohibiting technique and
direct regulation based on the "affecting commerce" rationale when it enacted
the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In United States v. Darby,105 which
upheld the Act and overruled Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Court approved both the
prohibiting technique and direct regulation based on the "affecting commerce"
rationale. Although not regulating a true crime, the FLSA made its regulations
of economic relationships enforceable by criminal sanctions. The combination in
Darby of a regulatory offense, the prohibiting technique, and the affecting
commerce rationale later resulted106 in the commingling of two lines of cases --
the exercising police power cases and the regulating economic activity cases --
once thought to be separate. 

The coincidence in Darby of the prohibiting technique, which requires no
rationale, and the "affecting commerce" rationale, which supports various
techniques, did not immediately result in the expansion of federal criminal law.
Although it interpreted the "affecting commerce" rationale expansively in
economic matters, the Court generally took a much more restrictive view in
criminal cases prior to 1970 when it decided Perez v. United States, 402 U.S.
146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971). In Perez, various strands from the
cases under the Commerce Clause met and merged into an expansive view of
Congress' power to create criminal law. The Court upheld application of a
federal "loan-shark" statute to local acts without any showing of an interstate
nexus or effect. ]07 The Court considered it sufficient that the activity was
part of a class of activities which Congress had targeted as having affected
commerce through organized crime. Id. at 154-56. The Court thought Darby to be
"particularly relevant . . . because it involved a criminal prosecution."108
However, Darby and the cases which built on it and were cited in Perez --
Wickard v. Filburn 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942), and the
public accommodations cases, Atlanta Hotel v. United States 379 U.S. 241, 85
S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964), and Katzenbach v. McClung 379 U.S.294 85 S.Ct.
377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964), -- were not criminal  cases, even though indictments
for regulatory offenses may have been involved. 


b. United States v. Lopez

As observed above,109 the majority in Lopez recognized the uncertainty unleashed
upon the lower courts left to reconcile that case with other Commerce Clause
cases. In reopening debate on issues once thought foreclosed, the majority
opinion in Lopez walks a fine line between two different views expressed by
justices who, while joining the opinion, also write concurring opinions. Two of
the justices "counsel[] great restraint," 115 S.Ct at 1634 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring), but one justice would "reconsider our 'substantial effects' test
with an eye toward constructing a standard that reflects the text and history of
the Commerce Clause without totally rejecting our more recent Commerce Clause
jurisprudence." Id. at 1642-43 (Thomas, J., concurring). While the Court's
opinion may represent a moderate position among the justices in the majority,
the dissenters consider the decision "radical." Id. at 1651 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) ("I also agree with JUSTICE SOUTER's exposition of the radical
character of the Court's holding.") 

In one Eleventh Circuit case applying Lopez, that court concluded that, under
the Commerce Clause, Congress possesses the power to enact the Freedom of Access
to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, Pub. L. No.103-259, 1098 Stat. 694 (1994)
(codified at 18 U.S.C. Section 248). See Cheffer v. Reno, 55 F.3d 1517 (11th
Cir. 1995). The Eleventh Circuit found support for Congress' conclusion that the
"access act regulates activity which 'substantially affects' interstate
commerce." 55 F.3d at 1520. In upholding the Access Act, it was not necessary to
go beyond a very narrow reading of Lopez. That is to say, Cheffer involved a
criminal statute, like the gun statute in Lopez; but unlike the gun statute,
Congress had made findings that the activity regulated by the Access Act
"substantially affects interstate commerce." The court accepted those findings
as persuasive. 

The Justice Department narrowly views Lopez as applying only to the facts of the
Gun Free Schools Act.110 Only wishful thinking, however, can lead to the
conclusion that the holding of Lopez is applicable only to schools or
guns-in-schools cases. Lopez could have chosen a narrower approach. Lopez could
have narrowly limited its holding to federal criminal statutes under the
Commerce Clause that involve no."substantial effect" on interstate commerce. It
did not do so. Had Lopez taken such an approach, Cheffer need not have been
decided any differently. More importantly, such a narrowed approach would not
have opened to debate the fundamental turn taken in the late 1930s jurisprudence
under the Commerce Clause, which the dissenters took pains to defend. As
previously noted, until Perez v. United States in 1971, the Supreme Court did
not actually confront the application of the post-1937 Commerce Clause
jurisprudence to federal criminal statutes. Before and even since, the Court has
tended toward narrow construction of federal criminal statutes, thereby avoiding
constitutional issues of federalism. See e.g.,United States v. Bass, 404 U.S.
336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). Lopez could have, but did not, reach
the result it did by disapproving Perez without thereby calling into question
anything else about Commerce Clause jurisprudence from 1937 to 1971.[111] 

Instead, Lopez relies on Perez to categorize Commerce Clause cases as being
divided into three: "First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of
interstate commerce. ... Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect
the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate
commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. ...
Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those
activities having a substantial relationship to interstate commerce." Id. at
1629-30 (citations omitted). Like Lopez, see Id. at 1629-30, this particular
case involves only the third of these categories. 

In discussing the third category, the Court repeatedly refers not simply to
regulating activities which have a substantial effect on interstate commerce but
to "regulating economic activity" which has a substantial effect on interstate
commerce. 

Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with
"commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define
those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of
economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the
intrastate activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial
transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate
commerce. Lopez, 514 U.S.___, 115 S.Ct. at 1630. 

In requiring that the object of the regulation, which "substantially affects"
interstate commerce, must itself be "economic activity," (i.e., commerce) rather
than merely "activities," the Court is being more faithful to Chief Justice
Marshall's explanation in Gibbons v. Ogden. See text accompanying n.83. 

Lopez also discusses and refutes the reasoning advanced by the government for
justifying Congressional action in that case. The court found the government's
"cost of crime" and "national productivity" rationales to be incorrect, because,
under such reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that might lead to
violent crime or any activity affecting the economic productivity of individual
citizens, "regardless of how tenuously [these activities] relate to interstate
commerce." Lopez, 514 U.S.___, 115 S.Ct. 1632. By demonstrating how the inherent
logic of certain rationales fails to place any meaningful limits on
congressional authority, Lopez requires that there be a genuine causal
connection between the regulated activity and interstate commerce. In so doing,
the Court is being more faithful to Chief Justice Marshall's ends/means analysis
in McCulloch. See n. 81 and accompanying text. In other words, the assumption
that the regulation of any activity which has a substantial effect on interstate
commerce is automatically "necessary and proper" is not appropriate under Lopez.
Thus, the Lopez majority criticizes the dissent for their willingness to gloss
over the tenuous connection between gun possession at a school and interstate
commerce. As Chief Justice Rehnquist notes, "depending upon the level of
generality, any activity can be looked upon as commercial." Lopez, 514 U. S.___,
115 S.Ct. at 1633 (Rehnquist, C.J.). Such reasoning, "lacks any real limits,"
id., and would lead to the acceptance of a general police power at the federal
level. Id. at 1634. See also Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S.
197, 402-403, 24 S.Ct. 436, 48 L.Ed. 679 (1904) ("Commerce depends upon
population, but Congress could not, on that ground, undertake to regulate
marriage and divorce. If the act before us is to be carried out according to
what seems to be the logic of the argument for the government . . . I can see no
part of the conduct of life with which, on similar principles, Congress might
not interfere").112 

Finally, the above discussion is devoted to what Lopez says; however, that case
is also noteworthy for what it fails to say. The ease with which the Supreme
Court might have upheld the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1990 is striking. This point
was not lost on the dissenting justices. The Court might have held that guns are
articles of commerce that can be used to restrain commerce. 514 U.S. at___ , 115
S.Ct. at 1651 (Stevens, J., dissenting). It did not. The Court could have
aggregated "the effect of all guns possessed in or near schools[.]"  Id. at___,
115 S. Ct. at 1658 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing Wickard, 317 U.S. at 127-28,
63 S.Ct. at 89-90); see id. at___, 115 S.Ct. at 1651 (Stevens,  J., dissenting).
It did not do this either. The Court also might have considered whether Congress
could have had a rational basis for concluding that the "regulated activity
sufficiently affected interstate commerce."113  Id. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 1658
(Breyer, J., dissenting). Again, the court would have none of this.114 See Lopez
at___, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-34. 


3. Application of Lopez to CERCLA.

Thus Lopez requires 1) that the statute itself regulate economic activity, which
activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce. Id. at 1630; and 2) that
the statute include a "jurisdictional element which would ensure, through
case-by-case inquiry, that the [statute] in question affects interstate
commerce." Id. at 1631. In applying Lopez to this case, the court finds it
doubtful that the object of regulation in this case iS "economic activity,"
i.e., "commerce," as that term is used in Lopez. It is true that at one point
the defendant operated two plants, which are the focus of this litigation, and
that these plants were surely engaged in "economic activity." These two plants,
however, no longer operate and have not since 1982, long before this litigation
was initiated. 

Arguably, this case might be somewhat different if the government were
attempting to regulate a functioning facility. Although, the complaint includes
an allegation about threatened releases, the fact remains that this suit seeks
clean-up of real property. While environmental degradation generally may have an
effect on interstate commerce, it is not clear to this court that the
degradation at issue in this case is necessarily "economic activity" or that it
has a "substantial effect" on interstate commerce. It is clear to this court
that the law regulating real property has been traditionally a local matter
falling under the police power of the states.115 

Given that Lopez does not limit its holding to criminal cases,116 the government
must demonstrate that its use of CERCLA is limited to the regulation of economic
activity, i. e., commerce, which "substantially affects" interstate commerce.
Congress (or the Executive on behalf of Congress) may regulate economic activity
which falls within the local police power, but it cannot exercise a general
police power. It appears to this court that CERCLA generally represents an
example of the kind of national police power rejected by Lopez. It is not
necessary, however, for this court to reach such a conclusion, because -- at
least in this case -- the application of CERCLA fails to meet the second
criteria of Lopez. 

Even if the application of CERCLA to the facts of this case does generally meet
the first test of regulating intrastate economic activity which substantially
affects interstate commerce, it must also be shown that the statute has a
"jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that
the [statute] in question affects interstate commerce." 115-S.Ct. at 1631.
Nothing in the statute provides for such a case-by-case inquiry. Nevertheless,
assuming it had such a provision, the particular inquiry in this case clearly
demonstrates that the activity in question has virtually no effect on interstate
commerce. As demonstrated in the remedial investigative report, any contaminants
still at Site 1 affect groundwater mostly by migrating through the
locally-contained alluvial aquifer. This aquifer lies atop a miocene aquifer.
The remedial-investigation report indicates there is little or no migration
between the two aquifers, and there is no evidence that contaminants at Site 1
travel across state lines. 

Accordingly, this court holds that EPA's attempt in this case to apply CERCLA
liability against the defendant would exceed the power of Congress under the
Commerce Clause. 


VII. CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the federal government has no constitutional
authority to do what it proposes at Site 1. The court therefore has no authority
to sign or enter the proposed consent decree and hereby DENIES the motion117 to
do so. 

Because the court has reached this conclusion, there is no conceivable remedy to
which the plaintiff would be entitled to under the complaint. This action is
therefore DISMISSED with prejudice.

1. The government labels Sites 1 and-2 as the "first operable unit" ("OUI") and
the "second operable unit" ("OU2"), respectively. Site 1 includes all of the
land except for the approximately sixty two acres designated as Site 2. See n.3.


2. Remedial-Investigation Report at 1-5. 

3. Site 2 consists of approximately 62 acres which form a natural basin lying
east of the plant, surrounded by wetlands, and adjacent to the Tombigbee River.
The government alleges that Olin (at the time known as Olin Mathieson) directed
surface runoff containing hazardous substances into Site 2, which discharges
into the Tombigbee River (the Tombigbee joins with the Alabama River to form the
Mobile River, which flows into Mobile Bay and then the Gulf of Mexico). However,
the costs which the federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") claims it
has incurred and will incur for cleanup in Site 2, and any injunctions it may
seek regarding this effort at Site 2, are not part of this action. The
government plans to file a separate action regarding Site 2. See Complaint at p.

17. This is not an action in which anyone is trying to avoid a responsibility to
the environment; Olin has agreed to perform the proposed remedial actions called
for in the consent decree. The fact that Olin, despite its reservations about
the fairness and even legality of the proposed consent decree, originally went
along with the EPA is a vivid testament to the powerlessness felt by this
citizen when forced to comply with various directives ordered by our
administrative state.

26. The defendant cites and seems to summarize an article entitled, "A Public
Policy Essay: Superfund Retroactivity Revisited," by George Clemon Freeman, Jr.,
published in the American Bar Association's Business Lawyer, vol. 50 at 663
(Feb., 1995) (hereinafter, "Freeman.") The author, a practicing attorney, who
was a member of the Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group, a congressional
advisory committee on the Act, and who has participated in litigation on the
retroactivity issue, see United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical
Co., 810 F.2d 726 (8th Cir. 1986), argues that neither the text nor legislative
history demonstrate that Congress intended CERCLA to be retroactive. He has
previously made this argument. See Id. notes 16 - 18, and accompanying text. The
author contends: 

If the question were before a federal court today in a case of first impression,
Superfund's liability provision, section 107(a), could not meet the test of
statutory construction set forth in Justice Stevens' majority opinion in
Landgraf. Neither the text of the statute not its legislative history could
sustain retroactive application. Nor could section 107(a) meet the more
restrictive test of Justice Scalia's concurrence, which looked only at the text
of the statute.

688 F.2d 204 (3d Cir. 1982). South Carolina Recycling concluded that the act was
not "retroactive," but applied CERCLA on the theory that because the previous
disposal continued to cause or threatened to cause releases after the Act's
effective date.

Court is unable to declare that the statute evidences the 'imperative character'
required to overcome the presumption against retroactivity"). 

32. 562 F. Supp. at 1306.

33. In footnotes, the court explained its view of the presumption: 

Since the principal basis for the presumption against retroactivity is the
threat of raising a constitutional issue, the reduction of that constitutional
issue must necessarily reduce the need to interpret CERCLA to avoid raising that
constitutional issue. The weight of the presumption therefore being reduced, a
more lenient approach in reviewing claims that the presumption has been
over-ridden may be appropriate. 562 F. Supp. art 1306, n.7. (emphasis added) 

After Thorpe and Bradley, the presumption against retroactivity has arguably
been changed to a presumption in favor of retroactivity. That presumption can
only be over-ridden where there is a clear legislative directive to limit the
statute to a prospective application or the change in law would cause manifest
injustice to the party adversely affected. Id. at 1307, n.9. (emphasis added). 

34. "Before turning to a close analysis of specific statutory provisions and
their accompanying legislative history, I will review the general purpose and
scheme of CERCLA," 605 F. Supp at 1069. 

35. See n.33, supra.

36. Additionally, both Shell Oil and Northeastern also rely upon an argument
disapproved of in Landgraf. Specifically, these two cases argue that the
affirmative preclusion of recovery for damages occurring before CERCLA'S
enactment in Section 107(f), the natural resource liability section, indicates
congressional intent for the other liability sections to operate retroactively.
See Shell Oil, 605 F. Supp. at 1076 and Northeastern, 810 F.2d at 736. Noting
that, "it would be surprising for Congress to have chosen to resolve [the
retroactivity issue] through negative inference," the Landgraf Court found a
remarkably similar argument to be unpersuasive. 114 S.Ct. at 1493-1494. 

37. The courts' discussion is as follows with reference to the presumption
itself emphasized: 

The district court correctly found Congress intended CERCLA to apply
retroactively. Id. at 839. We acknowledge there is a presumption against the
retroactive application of the statutes. See United States v. Security
Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 79, 103 S.Ct. 407, 413, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982). We
hold, however, that CERCLA Section 302(a), 42 U.S.C. Section 9652 (a), is
"merely a standard 'effective date' provision that indicated the date when an
action can first be brought and when the time begins to run for issuing
regulations and doing other future acts mandated by the statute." United States
v. Shell Oil Co., 605 F.Supp. 1064, 1075 (D. Colo. 1985); cf. Von Allmen v.
Connecticut Teachers Retirement Board, 613 F.2d 356, 359-60 (2d Cir. 1979)
(veterans statute). 

Although CERCLA does not expressly provide for retroactivity, it is manifestly
clear that Congress intended CERCLA to have retroactive effect. The language
used in the key liability provision, CERCLA Section 107, 42 U.S.C. Section 9607,
refers to actions and conditions in the past tense: "any person who at the time
of disposal of any hazardous substances owned or operated," CERCLA Section
107(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(2), "any person who... arranged with a
transporter for a transport for disposal," CERCLA Section 107(a)(3), 42 U.S.C.
Section 9607(a)(3), and "any person who . . . accepted any hazardous substances
for transport to . . . sites selected by such person," CERCLA Section 107(a)(4),
42 U.S.C. Section 9607 (a)(4). See, e.g., United States v. Conservation Chemical
Co., 619 F. Supp. 162, 220 (W.D. Mo. 1985); United States v. Shell Oil Co., 605
F. Supp. at 1069-73; United States v. South Carolina Recycling & Disposal, Inc.,
20 Env't Rep. Cases (BNA) 1753, 1760-62 (D. S.C. 1984) (The court in United
States v. South Carolina Recycling & Disposal, Inc., 20 Env't Rep. Cases (BNA)
1753, 1760 (D. S.C. 1984), noted CERCLA does not apply "retroactively" because
it does not impose liability for past conduct; rather, CERCLA imposes liability
upon those parties responsible for causing certain conditions, that is, the
release or threatened release or hazardous substances, that are the present or
future results of their past actions.); United States v. A & F Materials Co.,
578 F. Supp. at 1259; United States v. Price, 577 F.Supp. 1103, 1111-12 (D. N.J.
1983); Ohio ex rel. Brown v. Georgeoff, 562 F. Supp. 1300, 1312 (N.D. Ohio
1983); United States v. Outboard Marine Corp., 556 F. Supp. 54, 57 (N.D. Ill.
1982); United States v. Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp., 546 F. Supp. 1100, 1113-14
(D. Minn. 1982); see generally Developments in the Law -- Toxic Waste
Litigation, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1498 (1986) (Developments). 

Further, the statutory scheme itself is overwhelmingly remedial and retroactive.
CERCLA authorizes the EPA to force responsible parties to clean up inactive or
abandoned hazardous substance sites, CERCLA Section 106, 42 U.S.C. Section 9606,
and authorizes federal, state and local governments and private parties to clean
up such sites and then seek recovery of their response costs from responsible
parties, CERCLA Sections 104, 107, 42 U.S.C. Sections 9604, 9607. In order to be
effective, CERCLA must reach past conduct. CERCLA's backward-looking focus is
confirmed by the legislative history. See generally, H.R.Rep. No. 1016, 96th
Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6119 (CERCLA House
Report). Congress intended CERCLA "to initiate and establish a comprehensive
response and financing mechanism to abate and control the vast problems
associated with abandoned and inactive hazardous waste disposal sites." Id. at
22, 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 6125.

39. As Justice and the other parties in Georgeoff agreed, "there are no
unequivocal statements in the [CERCLA] statute indicating a Congressional intent
to make it apply retroactively." 562 F. Supp. at 1309. 

40. See discussion in B., supra and n. 41, infra. 

41. Although the passage of the 1990 bill may indicate that a majority of the
1991 Congress also favored retroactive application, even the will of the
majority does not become law unless it follows the path charted in Article I,
Section 7, cl. 2 of the Constitution. See IN5 v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 946-951,
103 S.Ct. 2764, 2781-2784, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983). 

42. Section 106(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. Section 9606(a), provides in pertinent
part: 

In addition to any other action taken by a State or local government, when the
President determines that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment
to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or
threatened release of a hazardous-substance from a facility, he may require the
Attorney General of the United States to secure such relief as may be necessary
to abate such danger or threat, and the district court of the United States in
the district in which the threat occurs shall have jurisdiction to grant such
relief as the public interest and the equities of the case may require. 

43. Section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. Section 96007(a), provides, in pertinent
part: 

(1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility; [and] 

(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or
operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of ... 

shall be liable for --

(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States
Government ... not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.... 

44. See generally 562 F.Supp. at 1309 - 11. "It will be unnecessary to construe
the word 'accepted' to apply to pre-enactment conduct to give it effect.
'Accepted' may apply to pre-enactment conduct, but the Statute does not require
such an application." Id. at 1310. 

45. "I find and conclude that congressional intent to either impose or withhold
liability for response costs incurred before CERCLA cannot be divined from the
verb tenses in Section 107(a)." 605 F. Supp. at 1073. 

46. Despite the language cited in n. 37, supra, Northeastern goes on to follow
the Shell Oil analysis and cites approvingly that court's finding that
congressional intent to impose liability for pre-enactment response costs cannot
be divined from the verb tenses in Section 107(a). See 810 F.2d at 735. 

47. See 106(a) quoted in n. 42, supra.

48. Id.

49. "Although liability under CERCLA iS premised in part upon conduct which
occurred prior to CERCLA's enactment in 1980 this court does not consider CERCLA
'retroactive' in the constitutional sense as applied to the facts of this case."

52. "Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of new statutes

53. As Senator Randolph stated in part in explaining the liability provisions of
the Compromise: 

The liability regime [Sec. 109] in this substitute contains some changes in
language from that in the bill reported by the Committee on Environment and
Public Works. The changes were made in recognition of the difficulty in
prescribing in statutory terms liability standards which will be applicable in
individual cases. The changes do not reflect a rejection of the standards in the
earlier bill. 

Unless otherwise provided in this act, the standard of liability is intended to
be the same as that provided in section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321). I understand this to be a standard of strict
liability. 

It is intended that issues of liability not resolved by this act, if any, shall
be governed by traditional and evolving principles of common law. An example is
joint and several liability, Any reference to these terms has been deleted, and
the liability of joint tortfeasors will be determined under common or previous
statutory law. 

54. 114 S.Ct. at 1499. Rather, the court must ask whether the new provision
attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. The
conclusion that a particular rule operates "retroactively" comes at the end of a
process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law
and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a
relevant past event. 

55. 562 F. Supp. at 1304 (emphasis added). 

The Court next turns to a consideration of Justice's position. Under the
liability provisions of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a), a "release or
threatened release" of hazardous wastes is required to trigger liability.
Justice argues that the release at the Dump is a continuing release of hazardous
waste triggering liability at any time before the wastes' removal. Because the
waste has yet to be removed, BFI has engaged in conduct taking place after the
enactment of CERLCA. Imposition of liability, therefore, would not be
retroactive because at least some of the facts giving rise to the liability are
based on events taking place after the enactment of CERCLA. 

In support of this argument, Justice cites a number of cases which it argues
hold that legislation designed to alleviate a continuing public nuisance does
not act retroactively. Samuels v. McCurdy, 267 U.S. 188, 45 S.Ct. 264, 69 L. Ed.
568 (1924); Chicago & Alton Railroad Company v. Transbarger, 238 U.S. 67, 35
S.Ct. 678, 59 L. Ed. 204 (1914); City of Bakersfield v. Miller, 64 Cal.2d 93,
410 P.2d 393, 48 Cal. Rptr. 889 (1966); People of Illinois v. Jones, 329 Ill.
App. 503, 69 N.E. 2d 522 (4th Dist. 1946). 

56. In Landgraf, the right to a jury trial does not apply retroactively, despite
the fact that it is a procedural provision, because this right is attached to
the punitive and compensatory damages provisions, to which the presumption
against retroactivity applies. See 114 S. Ct. at 1505. 

57. 114 S. Ct. at 1506. "Before we entertained that [constitutional] question,
we would have to be confronted with a statute that explicitly authorized
punitive damages for pre-enactment conduct. The Civil Rights Act of 1991
contains no such explicit command." 

58. The EPA's use of punitive damages is laid out in its "Superfund Enforcement
Strategy and Implementation Plan," as reprinted in Alfred R. Light, CERCLA Law
and Procedure Compendium at III-6: 

As authorized under sections 106 and 107, the government will pursue cases
involving treble damages and penalties for violations of unilateral and consent
orders. Taking such actions is important for establishing a credible deterrent.
These actions are available against persons who fail without sufficient cause to
comply with orders. 

59. See 114 S.Ct. at 1506: It does not make unlawful conduct that was lawful
when it occurred; as we have noted, supra, at 1490-1491, Section 102 only
reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns about a
lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such discrimination was
in many cases (although not this one) already subject to monetary liability in
the form of backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend that the compensatory
damages provisions smack of a "retributive" or other suspect legislative
purpose. Section 102 reflects Congress' desire to afford victims of
discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules established more
than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As least with respect to
its compensatory damages provisions, then Section 102 is not in a category in
which objections to retroactive application on grounds of fairness have their
greatest force. 

60. See "Superfund Enforcement Strategy and Implementation Plan" (Sept. 26,
1989) reprinted in Alfred R. Light, CERCLA Law and Procedure Compendium (BNA,
Washington, D.C., 1992) at III-2. 

EPA will consider private party responses as the preferred approach for the
majority of Superfund sites. At the same time, EPA will retain the maximum
amount of leverage to use the Fund at specific sites where negotiations are
unsuccessful. The goal of the government is to negotiate an agreement for 100%
of response costs. 

61. See also 114 S.Ct. at 1506. ("They do not 'compensate' by distributing funds
from public coffers, but by requiring particular employers to pay for harms
caused.") 

62. U.S. Constitution, Amendment V.

63. Section 106 (b)(2)(A) provides that "[a]ny person who receives and complies
with the liens of any [Section 106(a) order] may, within 60 days after
completion of the required action, petition the President for reimbursement from
the Fund for the reasonable costs of such action, plus interest." 

64. See Complaint Paragraph's 12 and 18. 

65. It is worth mentioning that the two cases in which the Court fails to find a
violation of.separation of powers, Morrison and Mistretta, involve statutes
which give powers to the judiciary. 

66. Professor Bernard Schwartz has written about a first draft of the Bowsher
opinion which would have cast doubt on the constitutionality of independent
agencies: 

since it virtually would have placed the Supreme Court imprimatur upon the claim
that independent agencies are unconstitutional. 

--. . . The years before Bowsher had seen a revival of the claim that the
independent agencies were unconstitutional because, though they exercised
"executed power," they were not subject to presidential control. The argument
against the agencies received the support of the Reagan Department of Justice. .
. . 

67. The activities of the EPA under CERCLA include a double delegation. First,
Congress has delegated to the President. Sec. 106. Then the President has
delegated to EPA. (Executive Order 12580 of January 3, 1987). 

68. National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d

105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), invalidated provisions in the Fair Labor
Standards Act applicable to state and local governments as exceeding Congress'
power under the Commerce Clause.

Act to state and local government.

United States, 66 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. 1995) (upholding the Brady Act against a
challenge under New York v. United States). 

72. The particular case involved the Indian Commerce Clause, but the case
overruled Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 2273, 105 L.Ed.2d

other power vested in them, as if the general power had been reduced to
particulars, and any one of these were to be violated; the same in short, as if
the State Legislatures should violate their respective constitutional
authorities. In the first instance, the success of the usurpation will depend on
the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to
the legislative acts; and in the last resort, a remedy must be obtained by the
people, who can by the election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts
of the usurpers.);

prevent injury to interstate commerce." Polish National Alliance of the United
States of North America v. National Labor Relations Board, (Black J.,

84. The language of the clause differs in its choice of prepositions to precede
"foreign Nations," i.e.. "with," and States, i.e., "among". The import of the
difference becomes readily apparent by using the preposition "among" to precede
"foreign Nations." The power to regulate commerce "among" is a superintending
power which Congress possesses vis-a-vis the states, but obviously not vis-a-vis
foreign nations. 

85. 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 1, 189-197, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). 

[The] words are, "Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign
nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes." 

The subject to be regulated is commerce; and... [to] ascertain the extent of the
power, it becomes necessary to settle the meaning of the word. The counsel for
the appellee would limit it to traffic, to buying and selling, or the
interchange of commodities,. and do not admit that it comprehends navigation.
This would restrict a general term, applicable to many objects, to one of its
significations. Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but is something more; it is
intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts
of nations, in all it branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for
carrying on that intercourse... 

To what commerce does this power extend? The constitution informs us, to
commerce "with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the
Indian tribes." 

It has [been] universally admitted that these words comprehend every species of
commercial intercourse between the United States and foreign nations. No sort of
trade can be carried on between this country and any other, to which this power
does not extend... 

[The] subject to which the power is next applied, is to commerce "among the
several states." The word "among" means intermingled with. A thing which is
among others is intermingled with them. Commerce among the states cannot stop at
the external boundary line of each state, but may be introduced into the
interior. 

It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that commerce which is
completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a state, or
between different parts of the same state, and which does not extend to or
affect other states. Such a power would be inconvenient, and is certainly
unnecessary. 

Comprehensive as the word "among" is, it may very properly be restricted to that
commerce which concerns more states than one. The phrase is not one which would
probably have been selected to indicate the completely interior traffic of a
state, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and the enumeration of
the particular classes of commerce to which the power was to be extended, would
not have been made, had the intention been to extend the power to every
description. The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that
something, if we regard the language or the subject of the sentence, must be the
exclusively internal commerce of a state. The genius and character of the whole
government seem to be, that its action is to be applied to all the external
concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the states
generally; but not to those which are completely within a particular state,
which do not affect other states, and with which it is not necessary to
interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the
government. The completely internal commerce of a state, then, may be considered
as reserved for the state itself. 

[We] are now arrived at the inquiry -- What is this power? 

It is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is
to be governed. This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in
itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations,
other than are prescribed in the constitution... [If], as has always been
understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is
plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations, and
among the several States, is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in
a single government, having in its constitution the same restrictions on the
exercise of the power as are found in the constitution of the United States. 

86. Justice Thomas makes a different critique of the Court's jurisprudence. He
says that the "substantially affects" language so broadens Congress's power that
much of Art. 1, Sec. 8 becomes "surplusage." (Thomas, J., concurring). 

87. 12 How. (53 U.S.) at 319-320.

88. Although the Marshall Court did not address many Commerce Clause Cases,
either active or dormant, it did address both. The Court decided Wilson v. The
Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 245 (1829) and Brown v. Md., 25
U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419 (1827). 

89. Whether the Constitution contains a "dormant" Commerce Clause is not an
issue in this case. See Justice Scalia's argument that the Constitution does not
contain a dormant commerce clause in Tyler Pipe Industries v. Washington, 483
U.S. 232, 107 S.Ct. 2810, 97 L.Ed.2d 199 (1987)(Scalia, J., concurring). 

90. Much of this historical overview summarizes part of an article by John S.
Baker, Jr., "Nationalizing Criminal Law: Does Organized Crime Make It Necessary
or Proper?", 16 Rutgers L.Rev. 495, 521-531 (1985). 

91. Act of March 2, 1895, ch. 191, 28 Stat. 963. 

92. 188 U.S. 321, 23 S.Ct. 321, 47 L.Ed. 492 (1903). 

93. Id. at 355-57.

94. Id. at 365 (Fuller, C.J., dissenting). 

95. Id. at 357.

96. In Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100, 10 S.Ct. 681, 34 L.Ed. 128 (7890), the
Court had prohibited states from blocking shipments of liquor into the state. 

97. Id. ,

98. The sale of lottery tickets in Louisiana was local as long as restricted to
the state. Once they moved across state lines, they affected other states.
Congress at the time, but not the Court, understood this difference. 

99. See United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 115, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609
(1941) (upholding Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938). 

100. 247 U.S. 251 (1918).

101. Congress' purpose in passing the statute is one thing; the statute is
inclusion of the word "purpose" as an element in the proof of the offense is
another. Mann Act Section 2, quoted supra note 128. As for Congress, its purpose
in the sense of its motive for passing the legislation might or might not have
been accurately incorporated into the purpose of the statute as evidenced by its
language. Thus, although the legislative history of a statute such as the Mann
Act may have reflected Congress's limited purpose, i.e., to stop the systematic
enticement and interstate transportation of women for purposes of prostitution,
proponents of the Act emphasized that its provisions did not reach prostitution
or immorality "per se," but only interstate and international "white slave
trade." H.R. Rep. No. 47, supra note 129, at 1-2, 9-11; E. Levi, An Introduction
to Legal Reasoning 36-38 (1949). 

The interpretation of the statutory language may not be limited to the
legislative purpose. Thus, in Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct.
192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917), the Supreme Court found that the statute reflected
much broader purposes. The actual language of the statute was not as limited as
the legislative history would indicate, but extended to single incidents of
transportation for "any immoral purpose." In Caminetti Justice McKenna dissented
because he thought the Court's construction of the Act went beyond the purposes
intended by Congress. Yet, previously, in Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308,
33 S.Ct. 281, 57 L.Ed. 523 (1913) he wrote the opinion upholding the Mann Act
against a Commerce Clause challenge. Had Justice McKenna paid more attention to
the statute itself in Hoke, he would have seen that its language went well
beyond the congressional purposes. As an element of the offense, the word
"purpose" required the prosecution to prove the defendant had a certain criminal
intent. Congress' purpose in putting the word "purpose" into the statute was
clear; it appeared to provide a Commerce Clause justification for purporting to
prohibit the transportation of persons within the.country. The effect of
regulating persons based on their purposes, i.e., motive or intent, however, was
to create a "true" crime rather than a regulatory offense. 

102. Thus, Congress thought purpose provided the constitutional justification
for passage of the Mann (White Slave) Act. White-Slave Traffic (Mann) Act, ch.
395, Section 2, 36 Stat. 825 (1910). After quoting from Champion, the House
Committee Report concluded: 

Certainly in the case of lotteries there is nothing harmful in the mere
transportation of the pieces of paper. The injury resulted from the connection
which existed between those tickets and the entire scheme of the lottery. It was
the purpose for which the tickets were used which made them an instrument of
injury to the public. H.R. Rep. No. 47, 61st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1909). 

In Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308 (1913), the Court analogized the aims of
the Mann Act to those of the Lottery Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Ch.
3915, 35 Stat. 768 (1906). The Mann Act, however, differed from both because it
did not actually prohibit anything or anyone from crossing state lines. Although
purporting to prohibit transportation, it could not do so because it regulated
persons rather than things. The Court dismissed such differences, contending
that "the substance of the congressional power is the same, only the manner of
its exercise must be accommodated to the difference in its objects." 227 U.S. at
323. The Court considered the similarity of purpose sufficient to uphold the
Mann Act under the Commerce Clause. Id at 322-23. Nevertheless, the difference
in means were significant. In the Food and Drug Act, like the Lottery Act,
Congress had provided for seizure of the offending articles when shipped across
state lines even though the misbranded food itself was not illegal when
prepared. Pure Food and Drug Act, ch. 3915, Section 10, 34 Stat. 768, 771
(1906). The Mann Act did not prohibit transportation of impure or immoral
things. It punished a male who had certain immoral or criminal purposes (a
criminal mental element), as the object of transporting a woman across state
lines. 

103. The Court distinguished the approved congressional purposes discussed in
Champion, Hipolite and Hoke from the economic purpose behind the child-labor
legislation. Id. at 270-72. Not only was legislation based on Congress' economic
purposes more clearly constitutional than that based on moral purposes, but as
Justice Holmes observed, See 247 U.S. at 280 (Holmes, J. dissenting) the moral
purposes prompting the child-labor legislation were certainly no less worthy
than those supporting earlier congressional legislation based on Congress'
economic purposes upheld by the Court. In both Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. at
276 ("We have neither authority nor disposition to question the motives of
Congress in enacting this legislation.") voiding congressional legislation and
in Champion, upholding congressional legislation, the Court took the same
position, namely that the extension of national power -- whether regulatory or
police -- turned on the Court's approval of Congress' purpose.

111. A prominent "New Deal" advocate, Robert Stern, has written about Perez as
being unrelated to the interpretation of the Commerce Clause put forth to
justify 1930's economic legislation: "Even a lawyer who fought for a realistic
interpretation which would recognize that in commercial matters the United
States was one nation finds himself surprised at where we are now -- and at how
readily the recent expansion is accepted." Robert Stern, The Commerce Clause
Revisited: The Federalization of Intrastate Crime, 15 Ariz. L. Rev. 271, 284
(1973). 

112. Accord Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 204-205, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d
1020 (1968) (Douglas, J., dissenting). Noting that state government itself is an
enterprise that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the Justice
Douglas stated that the logic of the case would lead to the conclusion that "the
National Government could devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though
that sovereignty is attested to by the Tenth Amendment." Id at 205. See also
A.L.A Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 554, 55
S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935) 

There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction between what
is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion in the outer
rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at
the centre. A society such as ours "is an elastic medium which transmits all
tremors through its territory; the only question is of their size." Per Learned
Hand, J., in the court below. The law is not indifferent to considerations of
degree. Activities local in their immediacy do not become interstate and
national because of distant repercussions. 

(Cardozo J., concurring); Polish National Alliance of the United States of North
America V. National Labor Relations Board, 322 U.S. 643, 650, 24 S.Ct. 436, 83
L.Ed. 1509 (1944). 

The interpenetrations of modern society have not wiped out state lines. It is
not for us to make inroads upon our federal system either by indifference to its
maintenance or excessive regard for the unifying forces of modern technology.
Scholastic reasoning may prove that no activity is isolated within the
boundaries of a single state, but that cannot justify the absorption of
legislative power over every activity. 

(Frankfurter, J.).

113. While the majority in Lopez does not utilize the rational basis test, it
does mention it, albeit in the context of warning against granting Congress too
much deference in deciding the extent of its authority under the Commerce
Clause. See Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1629, n. 2 ("Simply because Congress may conclude
that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce, does not
necessarily make it so.") (quoting Hodel, 452 U.S. at 311) (Rehnquist, J.,
concurring in judgment); ("Whether particular operations affect interstate
commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of the Congress to
regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and
can be settled finally only be this Court.") (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel,
379 U.S. at 273)(Black, J., concurring)." See also n. 72, supra. 

114. In addition, the majority might have asked, but did not, whether Congress
could have found that gun violence around schools creates a commercial problem,
Lopez at___, 115 S.Ct. at 1659 (Breyer, J., dissenting), or perhaps a serious
economic threat to "consequently inadequately educated workers who must endure
low paying jobs" and to communities and businesses that might otherwise gain
from a well-educated work force. Id. at 115 S.Ct. at 1661 (Breyer, J.,
dissenting). 

115. See e.g., United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., 412 U.S. 580, 591,
93 S.Ct. 2389, 37 L.Ed.2d 187 (1973)("Even when federal general law was in its
heyday, an exception was carved out for local laws of real property.")(Burger,
C.J.); Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 144, 155, 64 S.Ct. 474, 480, 88
L.Ed.635 (1944) ("The great body of law in this country which controls
acquisition, transmission, and transfer of property, and defines the rights of
its owners in relation to the state or to private parties, is found in the
statutes and decisions of the  state."); Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff,
467 U.S. 229, 241-242, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984)("Regulation of
[land] oligopoly and the evils associated with it is a classic exercise of the
State's police powers.") 

It is also worth mentioning that Congress agrees that reduction, control, and
the prevention of pollution, and the collection and disposal of solid waste, are
all the primary responsibility of state and local governments. See e.g., 42
U.S.C. Section 7401(a)(3)(Clean Air Act); 42 U.S.C. Section 6901(a)(4)(Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act); 33 U.S.C. Section 1251(b)(Federal Water
Pollution and Control Act).

Editor's Note:  The following is a transcript of a speech given by
Senator Bob Dole in front of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.


<H3 align=center>SENATOR BOB DOLE REMARKS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY 
<BR><BR>
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS
<BR><BR>
WASHINGTON, DC<BR>
APRIL 19, 1996</H3>

<P>Thank you, Edward Seaton for that introduction and thank you all for
the opportunity to be here today. </P>

<P>I know that most speakers who address this audience start with a
discussion of freedom of the press and the vital role of the Fourth
Estate in defending this most precious of constitutional guarantees. 
But as important as the press's constitutional contribution is, there
is much more to your place in our economy and society, much that
makes this industry a good snapshot of what my campaign for President
this year will be all about. </P>

<P>In the coming months, I will be talking about entrepreneurship,
economic growth, and the opportunities that the new global economy
will open to all of us -- if the right policies come from Washington.</P>


<P>I will also be talking about reaffirming America's core values --
respect for the rule of law, reverence for our faiths, devotion to
integrity and reason in our national discourse, dedication to family,
optimism about the future, belief in hard work, personal
responsibility, and honesty in our dealings. </P>

<P>And when we talk about reaffirming the values of our national life,
newspapers are among the prime transmitters of our values -- in the
character of reporting, in the open forums for serious debate that so
many editorial pages have become, in a medium driven by respect for
ideas and national discourse. </P>

<P>I believe this campaign takes place at a defining moment in our
national history.  And the choice the American people will make this
November could not be more profound. </P>

<P>Will we have, as our founders intended, a government controlled by
the people, or a people increasingly controlled by an ever larger,
more arrogant, and more intrusive government? </P>

<P>The President says "the era of big government is over," but two years
ago he hit American families with the largest tax increase in
history, and , as a result, our economy limps along at sub-standard
growth rates -- barely half the average rate of the 1980's. </P>

<P>A growing national debt eats away at our future, and our children's
future, yet that same President chose to veto the first balanced
budget in a generation, offering a fantasy budget in its place that
won't make real cuts until the next century. </P>

<P>A liberal education establishment leaves 25 percent of our high
school seniors functionally illiterate, and a seemingly perpetual
welfare bureaucracy assaults the values of self-reliance and breaks
families apart by driving fathers away. </P>

<P>Yet the President opposes serious attempts to reform education and
vetoed a welfare bill that would have truly ended the scourge of
"welfare as we know it." </P>

<P>But of all the values and issues that we will be debating in this
campaign, perhaps none is more important than the one we used to take
for granted -- Americans' confidence in their courts and trust in the
rule of law. </P>

<P>We hear a great deal about the sense of uncertainty that so many
Americans feel.  And, as we know, corporate layoffs are among the
sources of this anxiety -- together with the sliding of after-tax
incomes, which have begun declining again after their steady rise in
the 1980's. </P>

<P>But, I believe there is a reason beyond economics for the concern so
many of us feel -- and that's the lowering of what the editors of the
Wall Street Journal called sometime ago our social "guard rails," the
standards that guide day-to-day behavior, that make for a sense of
civility and fairness and right and wrong in our daily lives. </P>

<P>Our courts and our legal system were intended to be the most secure
of those guard rails.  They are supposed to set predictable standards
of what is fair and unfair, of what is right and wrong, of what the
law says and what it doesn't say. </P>

<P>They should be the glue that holds our society together, that helps
to guarantee all Americans a right as precious as any other -- the
right to live and raise our families in peaceful, law-abiding
communities, to send our children to school without fear of violence
and drugs, to feel safe in our homes and on our streets. </P>

<P>That is how it should be.  But American today is a society in which
law-abiding citizens feel increasingly at risk.  You know the
figures.  Each and every year, some 43 million Americans are victims
of crime.  Some 11 million are victims of violent crime. </P>

<P>Most Americans surely share the concern of FBI Director Louis Freeh,
who said that crime remains at "intolerable levels" and warned of the
disturbing skyrocketing of violent crimes by juveniles.  No society
that considers itself civilized can accept an annual death toll of
almost 24,000 murders, no matter how bad the previous year's carnage.</P>


<P>There are many reasons for the crime explosion:  the proliferation of
drugs; the almost total obliteration of the family in the welfare
culture of the inner city where as many as 80 percent of all children
are born out of wedlock, and too many into a life of neglect; and
maybe -- I certainly believe it to be the case -- a popular culture
that in movies and television glorifies violence, casual sex, and
anti-social behavior.  I have spoken on these issues -- and I will
continue to throughout this campaign. </P>

<P>Today, however, I want to address another issue, one that is also
devastating.  If we are looking for the "root causes" of the crime
explosion, this is clearly one of them. </P>

<P>I am speaking of the crisis in our courts.  The crisis in our legal
system.  And the crisis of confidence this is causing in America. </P>

<P>The legal guard rails that protected our society -- that ensured a
certain fundamental level of security and safety for America's
families -- those guard rails have in many places been knocked down,
even dismantled, often by the very judges and jurists who have been
entrusted with the sacred duty of upholding the rule of law. </P>

<P>Now, of course I'm aware that whenever one focuses the spotlight of
criticism on the actions of some of our judges, a hue and cry is
raised about the "independence of the judiciary."  Judicial
independence is a basic, vital constitutional principle, one that
every elected official is sworn to uphold, as we are sworn to uphold
the Constitution.  It is a principle that I take very seriously as a
Senator. </P>

<P>But there is nothing in the Constitution that says judges should be
above criticism, that they can not or should not be held up to
scrutiny for their actions -- actions that often have a huge and
immediate impact on American life, actions that help shape the
character of our nation. </P>

<P>Our founders intended our judges to be independent, not untouchable. 
All of us in public life are subject to criticism.  It's possible
that even I might come in for a little criticism between now and
November.  It's all part of the vigorous debate of ideas and policies
that makes democracy work. </P>

<P>And I believe that the kind of judges we appoint -- and the basic
philosophies they hold -- should be an important issue in this
campaign for the Presidency of the United States.  Because in the
long run, the federal judges a President chooses may be his most
profound legacy.  Legislation comes and goes.  A bad bill this year
can be voted down next year.  Bud judges remain. Long after the
President leaves office, they will still be on the bench -- the
rulings they make stretching out over a lifetime, affecting the lives
not just of one generation, but their children too. </P>

<P>Let me say that not all Republican-appointed judges are perfect and
not all Democrat-appointed judges are bad. Most judges are fine
public servants and out of deference to a President's constitutional
prerogative I have not opposed most of President Clinton's judicial
nominees. But the fact is, when it comes to what kind of judges we
want to appoint to the federal bench, President Clinton and I
fundamentally differ. </P>

<P>It's no secret where I stand. I've said it before. I will say it to
you now. </P>

<P>I will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who know how to read and
respect the clear language of the Constitution as it is written and
don't search to find rationalizations for their liberal agenda in
so-called "emanations" and "penumbras" never intended or imagined by
founders. </P>

<P>I will appoint judges who respect the rule of law, who understand
that society is not to blame for crime, criminals are; judges who
protect the rights of crime victims, not invent ever newer and more
expansive "rights" for criminal defendants. </P>

<P>And Dole judges will hand down strict sentences to criminals in order
to protect law-abiding citizens from further violence and harm. </P>

<P>I find it shameful that law-abiding Americans are often locked behind
bars -- the security bars on the windows of their homes -- while
criminals are left free to roam the streets. </P>

<P>President Clinton may talk the same language as I do on many of these
issues. I know he does. But as, I'm sorry to say, with so many
things, his actions profoundly depart from the meaning of his words. </P>

<P>Many of the judges Mr. Clinton has appointed to the federal bench are
precisely the ones who are dismantling those guard rails that protect
society from the predatory, the violent, the anti-social elements in
our midst. </P>

<P>His appointees to the Supreme court have been among the most willing
to use technicalities to overturn death sentences for brutal
murderers. They frequently vote to grant last minute stays of
execution, even when the death row inmate's claims are plainly
frivolous. </P>

<P>And a startling number of Mr. Clinton's lower court judges have
demonstrated an outright hostility to law enforcement. </P>

<P>You've all heard, many of you have probably written about, the
infamous decision of Judge Harold Baer in New York, who found that it
was perfectly reasonable for men to run from the police, because --
he said -- residents in the area regard law enforcement as "corrupt."
He added that he would have been suspicious, quote, "had the men not
run when the cops began to stare at them." Based on this "reasoning"
-- I put the word in quotation marks -- Judge Baer suppressed the
physical evidence the police found: 75 pounds of cocaine and 4 pounds
of heroin -- $4 million worth of poisonous drugs. He even suppressed
the defendant's voluntary confession. </P>

<P>As I say, Judge Baer's decision received some notoriety, and he even
reversed his decision when the criticism mounted -- finally coming
from an embarrassed White House itself. But the appalling fact is,
Judge Baer is hardly an exception among Clinton judicial appointees. </P>

<P>Let me give you a few more examples from Bill Clinton's judicial
"Hall of Shame." </P>

<P>Take the case of Clinton-appointee Judge Leonie Brinkema of Virginia,
who disregarded U.S. sentencing guidelines to go easy on a man who
was convicted of three counts of murder for hire, saying the
defendant was "naive" and "unrealistic," undeserving of the
punishment required by law. </P>

<P>Or Judge Rosemary Barkett, who previously served on the Florida
Supreme Court. While on this court, she joined a dissenting opinion
that exemplifies the liberal view of the criminal as victim of
society. This is how Judge Barkett described a brutal,
racially-motivated killing, quote, "This case is not simply a
homicide case, it is also a social awareness case." The murderer, the
judges declared, was motivated by the "pervasive illness of racial
discrimination" and the victim was, in the murderer's eyes, only "a
symbolic representative of the class causing the perceived
injustices." </P>

<P>When judges make decisions like this, they don't so much wield a
gavel as wield a sledgehammer against the delicate structure of the
rule of law. Bill Clinton rewarded this judge with a seat on the
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals where she continues to press her
liberal agenda. </P>

<P>For this decision, Judge Barkett wins a leading role in Bill
Clinton's judicial Hall of Shame, but in many ways she is outdone by
another Clinton appointee, Judge H. Lee Sarokin. Judge Sarokin first
attained national fame as a federal district court judge, ruling in
favor of a homeless man who had been evicted from a public library in
New Jersey because he harassed library personnel, talked loudly to
himself, and emitted a body odor sufficiently overpowering to drive
away patrons and staff. Judge Sarokin, in a decision of
quintessential liberal self-rightousness, lectured, quote, "[if] we
wish to shield our eyes and ears from the homeless, we should revoke
their condition, not their library cards." </P>

<P>Judge Sarokin attained additional fame when the Third Circuit Court
of Appeals took the extraordinary step of removing him from a tobacco
case for blatant bias. Even the New York Times applauded the removal,
stating that Judge Sarokin had "flunked an important test of
credibility." </P>

<P>Even more startling, in an article published in the West Virginia Law
Review, Judge Sarokin suggests that pre-trial and pre-conviction
detention of violent criminals is somehow unconstitutional. If this
radical position were to prevail, vicious criminals would be free to
roam the streets before their convictions -- or flee until they get
caught again . . . if they are caught again. </P>

<P>This judge, who twists the Constitution to impose his liberal views
of social policy, whose bias in the courtroom is so blatant that he
had to be removed from a case -- this judge was hand-picked by
President Clinton to sit on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the
second highest court in the land -- and the very court that had
removed him for bias earlier. </P>

<P>I voted against confirming Judge Sarokin. I have profound questions
whether such a man should be sitting on the federal bench, let alone
one of the highest courts in the land. And I think it is a profoundly
important question that the American people will have to ask this
November -- if our society can afford to keep in office a President
who consistently appoints such liberal judges to the federal bench. </P>

<P>As it stands right now, Mr. Clinton has appointed nearly 25 percent
of all the sitting judges. In another four years, he might easily be
able to bring that number to more than 50 percent. </P>

<P>Do we really want the majority of judges on the federal bench to
think like Judges Barkett, Baer, Brinkema, and Sarokin -- an all-star
team of liberal leniency -- judges who seem intent on dismantling the
rule of law from the bench? </P>

<P>Then there's the Supreme Court. Since Bill Clinton took office, some
of the High Court's most important rulings -- on issues ranging from
affirmative action to private property rights to religious expression
in public schools -- were decided by just one vote. If we give Bill
Clinton the opportunity to make just one more appointment to the
Supreme Court, we could have the most liberal court since the Warren
Court of the 1960s. </P>

<P>We could lock in liberal judicial activism for the next generation,
and the social landscape could dramatically change. More federal
intrusion in the lives of average Americans. More centralized power
in Washington. Less freedom of religious expression. More rights for
criminals -- and more arrogant disregard of the rights of law-abiding
citizens. </P>

<P>Now I want to be clear. Federal judges do have a duty to protect the
rights of the accused to a fair trial. Judges should have the power
to strike down laws that are contrary to the Constitution. </P>

<P>But the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the
people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the
utmost restraint -- without that restraint, judicial review becomes
nothing less than judicial tyranny. </P>

<P>I believe that it is vital to America that in the coming months of
this campaign President Clinton and I debate in a forthright and
candid manner our two very different visions of the federal
judiciary.  He has a clear record -- let him explain to the American
people the principles that guided his appointments of Judges Barkett,
Baer, Brinkema, and Sarokin -- and so many others like them. </P>

<P>And I will forthrightly and candidly lay down my principles because I
think the American people have a right to know. </P>

<P>For me, as I have said, foremost among those principles is respect
for the clear and evident meaning of the Constitution, which includes
the much neglected and abused 10th Amendment. </P>

<P>Dole judges will know the 10th Amendment by heart.  It reads; "The
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people." The federal power grab will end in
the Dole Administration. </P>

<P>Dole judges will also share the American people's -- and the
Constitution's -- vision of a color blind society free of
discrimination.  We are a nation built on the principle of individual
rights and responsibilities, and laws that divide our citizens by
race or group strike at the heart of what America is all about. 
After thirty years of liberal experimentation, America knows that
state-mandated discrimination caused only bitterness and division,
and undermines the foundation of fairness on which any society must
be built. </P>

<P>Americans deserve fairness, not favoritism. </P>

<P>I've always been a big believer in public discourse. The more the
American people know about what government officials -- including
federal judges -- are doing in their name, the stronger our democracy
will be.  As President, I will respect the public's right to know by
requiring my Attorney General to publish an annual report collecting
and summarizing the decisions of our federal judges in the area of
criminal law.  Thanks to the members of the Fourth Estate, we learned
of Judge Baer -- but how many similar decisions go unreported,
unknown to the public at large? </P>

<P>I also intend to stop the harassment of our legal system by convicted
criminals, who last year filed more than 65,000 civil lawsuits
against the government in federal court, most of them entirely
frivolous.  The cost to the taxpayer was about $81 million.  Over the
same time, the Justice Department initiated only about 45,000
prosecutions.  In other words, convicted criminals outscored our
Justice Department by 20,000 lawsuits.  I introduced a bill to shut
down this waste of taxpayers' money.  President Clinton vetoed it. 
As President, I will make sure that it passes. </P>

<P>Finally, it is time to remove the American Bar Association from its
role in reviewing potential judicial appointees.  Originally founded
to ensure "competence and integrity" in the bar, the ABA has become
nothing more than another blatantly partisan liberal advocacy group. </P>

<P>In my hands, I have the ABA's 1995 lobbying disclosure form, which
lists the ABA's position on many of the issues that have come before
Congress.  Here are some of the highlights: </P>

<P>Mandatory minimum sentences for dealers who sell drugs to children. 
The ABA is opposed. </P>

<P> A constitutional amendment to protect the flag. 
The ABA is opposed. </P>

<P> The Religious Equality Amendment allowing 
voluntary school prayer.  The ABA is opposed. </P>

<P>Meaningful habeas corpus reform.  Real product liability reform. 
Prison litigation reform.  Opposed, opposed, opposed. </P>

<P>The ABA even opposes closing legal loopholes that would make it
easier to convict vicious sex offenders. With that kind of record of
liberal political activism, why do we allow the American Bar
Association to judge our judges? </P>

<P>In a Dole Administration, the American Bar Association will no longer
have a retainer at the White House and the trial lawyers will not be
calling the shots.  in place of the narrowly partisan and
ideologically liberal ABA, I will create a non-partisan Judicial
Integrity Panel, consisting of police, prosecutors, crime victims,
legal scholars, and representatives of other legal and professional
organizations.  As President, I will look to this panel -- not the
ABA -- to advise me who is, and who isn't, qualified to sit on the
federal bench. </P>

<P>America has a choice this November.  Will we continue down the path
his Administration has set us on -- of liberal experimentation in our
courts -- or will we regain the common sense and common wisdom
contained in the very clearly written prose of our Constitution? </P>

<P>Will we restore confidence in the rule of law?  Will we restore the
American people's trust in the fairness of our legal system?  Will
the law once again become an expression of our deepest values as a
nation?  Will it support the "guard rails" of individual
responsibility, of a civil society that is itself truly civil? </P>

<P>I am determined to make the rule of law the rule in America once
again.  I am determined to do all that is in the President's power to
re-establish the integrity of our courts and restore safety,
fairness, and civility to our land. </P>

<P>To establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility are two of the
primary objectives of our Constitution.  And they will be my sacred
objectives as President. </P>

<P>Thank you and God bless America.</P>


<H2>FACT SHEET</H2>

<P>Bob Dole believes that the kind of judges we appoint -- and the basic
philosophies they hold -- should be an important issue in this
campaign.  Indeed, in the long run, the federal judges a President
chooses may be his most profound and lasting legacy. </P>

<P>As it now stands, President Clinton has appointed nearly 25% of all
federal judges and if reelected this number would probably exceed
50%.  The American people must ask themselves whether they can afford
to reelect a president who will continue to appoint liberal judges
who too often seem intent on dismantling the rule of law from the
bench. </P>

<P>As President, Bob Dole will attack this crisis at its core and
appoint judges who protect the rights of crime victims, not invent
newer and more expansive "rights" for criminal defendants.  He will
appoint judges who respect the rule of law, who understand that
society is not to blame for crime, criminals are. </P>

<P>Here are just several examples of President Clinton's judicial "Hall
of Shame": </P><UL>

<P><LI> District Judge Harold Baer of New York suppressed as evidence
almost 80 pounds of drugs and the voluntary confession of the
defendant because he believed that the police did not have cause to
search a car after they witnessed four men place large duffel bags in
the car and then run when they spotted the police.  Judge Baer's
"reasoning" was that in this particular neighborhood, residents must
regard the police as "corrupt" and therefore it would have been
suspicious "had the men not run when the cops began to stare at
them."  Judge Baer reversed his ill-reasoned opinion after much
public scrutiny.  <I>U.S. v. Bayless</I>, 913 F. Supp. 232 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). </P>

<P><LI>  Judge Rosemary Barkett of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, while
serving on the Florida Supreme Court, joined a dissenting opinion
that described a brutal, racially-motivated killing as "a social
awareness case." Judge Barkett insisted that the killer had "socially
redeeming values," even though he stabbed his victim repeatedly, shot
him twice, and laughed at the victim while he pled for his life. 
<I>Dougan v. State of Florida</I>, 515 So.2d 1 (Fla. 1992). </P>

<P><LI> District Judge Leonie Brinkema of Virginia disregarded U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines and reduced the sentence of a man convicted of
three counts of murder for hire in part because she felt the
defendant was "naive" and "unrealistic."  <I>U.S. v. Morin</I>
(unpublished). </P>

<P><LI> District Judge Raymond Jackson of Virginia dismissed all federal
charges against a youth because he thought there was no substantial
federal interest in prosecuting a juvenile for armed robbery.  <I>U.S.
v. Male Juvenile</I>, 844 F. Supp. 280 (E.D. Va. 1994). </P>

<P><LI>  Judge M. Blane Michael of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals who
joined a dissent with Carter appointees arguing that a not
fully-operative letter bomb sent to a U.S. Attorney was not a
"dangerous weapon."  <I>U.S. v. Harnrick</I>, 43 F.3d 877 (4th Cir. 1995)
(en banc). </P>

<P>Not only are the lower courts at risk, but our nation's highest Court
is as well.  Many of the Supreme Court's most important rulings since
Bill Clinton took office -- on issues ranging from affirmative action
(<I>Adarand v. Pena</I>, 115 S. Ct. 2097 (1995)) to private property rights
(<I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994)) to religious
expression in public schools (<I>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</I>,
115 S.Ct. 2510 (1995)) -- were decided by just one vote.  If Bill
Clinton is given the opportunity to make just one more appointment to
the Supreme Court, the result could be the most liberal court since
the Warren Court of the 1960s. </P>

<H2 align=center> Making Law, Making Enemies</H2>



<B>Scientology's lawyers are pushing the IP envelope to keep the church's
secret, sacred scriptures off the Internet. But will their heavy-handed tactics
undermine key courtroom victories? </B>


<H4 align=center>By Alison Frankel </H4>


<P>Helena Kobrin was ecstatic. It was January 19, and Kobrin -- a Los Angeles
solo practitioner whose only client is the <a href=http://www.scientology.org>Church of Scientology</a> International
-- had just gotten word of a ruling from Virginia U.S. district court judge
Leonie Brinkema on a summary judgment motion by the church. On the phone from
California, she was bursting with the news. "Do you want to know the results of
the hearing?" she says. "Judge Brinkema granted summary judgment." Brinkema,
she explains, ruled from the bench that Scientology copyrights had been
infringed by a critic of the church. "This is a major victory," Kobrin
enthuses. </P>

<P>She's right. Brinkema found that a former Scientologist who had posted about
65 pages of secret, sacred writings to an Internet discussion group had not
made fair use of the materials, but had infringed the church's rights to its
holy scriptures. With Scientology in the middle of two other Internet
intellectual property suits -- one of which involves the same postings as the
Virginia case -- Brinkema's ruling may, as Kobrin hopes, turn out to be a
breakthrough in the church's campaign to protect the secret writings of
Scientology founder <a href=http://www.lronhubbard.org>L. Ron Hubbard</a> -- writings that form the spiritual and
economic backbone of the religion. </P>

<P>But it may be too late. And if it is, the church can blame its own
litigation tactics. The church's Internet cases are relatively simple as far as
their copyright questions are concerned, and Scientology certainly has a strong
legal argument that posting in bulk secret, unpublished writings -- with little
or no commentary attached -- violates its copyrights. But Scientology has not
been content to make simple, narrow copyright claims in these three cases.
Instead, the church has litigated with characteristic overkill. Scientology
lawyers sought and obtained writs of seizure in all three cases, permitting
church lawyers and computer experts to stage surprise raids on the former
Scientologists who were posting church scriptures. Because the postings were to
Internet sites, the church also sued the companies that provided the former
Scientologists with access to the Internet, arguing that bulletin boards and
Internet access providers were directly liable for their users' copyright
violations. </P>

<P>When <I>The Washington Post</I> got hold of the church scriptures and
published a story about the dispute, quoting all of 46 words of secret Hubbard
writings, the church sued the newspaper and two of its reporters. Scientology
counsel Kobrin tried to shut down the on-line discussion group where the
infringing postings were showing up, and subsequently wrote dozens of
threatening letters to Internet participants who got involved in the battle.
</P>

<P>In the process, Kobrin became perhaps the most reviled lawyer in Internet
lore, and probably the only lawyer who's been the subject of a Web site devoted
to nasty attacks on her. More importantly, the church turned gaining possession
of its secret writings into a crusade for some Internet devotees, known as
"netizens." Computer jocks who had had no previous interest in Scientology were
outraged by the church's tactics, and responded in kind. Angry netizens -- as
ruthlessly zealous in their way as Scientology litigators are in theirs --
played an elaborate game of hide-and-seek with the Scientology scriptures,
posting them in sites all over the Internet faster than the church could shut
them down. Getting a letter from Helena Kobrin became something of a point of
pride for Net personalities who took up the anti- Scientology cause. </P>

<P>As a result, any damage done by the infringing postings was vastly magnified
as more people got interested in the scriptures -- and more people became
intent on making them public. And that damage, in turn, was magnified by all of
the press attention that the battle between the church and the cyberspace
community attracted. </P>

<P>Kobrin, who is not the apologizing type, makes none for the church's
tactics. She says the church had to police its copyrights vigorously or else
face the prospect of losing them. The church, she and other Scientology lawyers
maintain, did everything it could to end the infringing posting without
litigation, and once forced into suing, did nothing more than what software
companies do when their copyrights are at stake. Kobrin also says the
litigation is serving its purpose; illicit posting, she maintains, has dropped
off since the litigation began, and rulings like Judge Brinkema's will surely
clarify Scientology's rights to its intellectual property. </P>

<P>But that ruling comes at the cost of other adverse findings in all three
courts -- and at the cost of precisely the kind of public attention the church
did not want its scriptures to get. And that attention is likely to intensify
for as long as the three-pronged litigation goes on, creating, in some
instances, new Internet law with far-reaching copyright implications. Says
netizen Ronald Newman: "They turned what was a small dispute involving a few
people into a major thing." </P>

<H3>The Documents</H3> 

<P>Scientology was founded by science fiction novelist L. Ron Hubbard in 1952.
At the religion's foundation is a belief that people are immortal spiritual
beings, called Thetans, whose experience extends beyond a single lifetime.
Scientologists believe that through "auditing" -- a process devised by Hubbard
- - they can overcome the negative experiences that impede spiritual awareness.
Hubbard provided voluminous text about his beliefs, leaving at his death in
1986 554 written works, nearly 3,000 hours of taped lectures, and more than 100
instructional films. Most of these -- including Hubbard's longtime mainstay of
bestseller lists, <a href=http://www.dianetics.org><I>Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</I></a> -- are
public. </P>

<P>Beginning in 1966, however, Hubbard began generating material that he
instructed be kept secret. Even the aides to whom Hubbard entrusted the
originals of these works, according to the testimony of Scientology official
Warren McShane in one of the Internet cases, were not allowed to read them as
they copied them. In McShane's account, these secret materials derive from
Hubbard's discovery that incidents far back in history "have debilitized [sic]
the Thetan and all Thetans. . . . Through [Hubbard's] research and discoveries
over the years he found the way out," McShane continued. "He found what had
happened many, many years ago, traumatic and devastating circumstances to all
Thetans, and discovered and developed a way out, so to speak, a particular
series of processes and things that a person can do in Scientology that can
rekindle the person's native abilities and his natural spiritual awareness of
himself and others." </P>

<P>Hubbard believed that Thetans were intentionally blocked from resolving some
terrible historic experiences, and that he had uncovered the way to reverse the
blockage and lead Thetans to spiritual awareness. But he insisted on
confidentiality because, McShane explained, he believed "in the wrong hands
that that technology could be used to further degradate [sic] the individual
and stop him from regaining his natural abilities." Scientologists couch the
danger in terms of spiritual harm, saying that people who are exposed to the
materials before they are spiritually prepared can forever damage their
well-being; former Scientologists say they were instructed that anyone who read
the materials prematurely would get pneumonia and die. </P>

<P>Hubbard wrote eight levels of the secret materials, called the Operating
Thetan (OT) materials or the Advanced Technology, over the next 20 years. In
all they comprise about 700 pages. For the privilege of seeing and studying the
OT materials, level by level, parishioners deemed spiritually and ethically fit
have to pay "fixed donations," which began in 1993 at $2,200 for OT I and total
tens of thousands of dollars for all eight levels. The church, McShane
testified, derives significant revenue from the fixed donations. </P>

<P>The church has long taken extraordinary measures to keep the OT materials
secret. Scientologists who are invited to view the documents have always had to
sign confidentiality agreements. In the early days the materials were kept in
locked file cabinets in locked rooms. If they had to be moved, they were logged
in and out of their file cabinets and couriered in locked briefcases. As
technology advanced over the years, the church's security measures got more
sophisticated. Today, according to McShane's testimony, all OT materials are
kept in sealed binders, wired into a computer system and available for viewing
in only six of Scientology's churches worldwide, all staffed by the most
trusted Scientology staffers, known as the Sea Organization. When parishioners
are invited to see the documents, the Scientology instructor removes the
binders from their cabinet, unplugging them electronically, thus triggering the
room's doors to lock magnetically. The instructor has about 20 seconds to plug
the binder in at the table before an alarm goes off and, presumably, security
guards come rushing in. </P>

<P>Nevertheless, OT materials <I>have</I> leaked. The church maintains that the
documents have gotten out only through theft. Some were stolen in England, and
others were stolen from a Danish church in 1983. "[Thieves] dressed themselves
up in uniforms that are worn by the Sea Organization," testified McShane. "The
staff at [the] organization in Copenhagen fell for the pretense, allowed them
to view the materials in a secure room. They proceeded then to put them in a
briefcase and walk out to the car that was sitting outside in front of the
church with the motor running. The whole bit, just like the movies." </P>

<P>Just like the Keystone Kops, according to Robert Vaughn Young, who was a
senior public relations operation official until he left the church in 1989.
Young testified in one of the Internet cases that the OT materials had gotten
out in all sorts of ways. "The funniest one," Young said, "was a gentleman
[who] put the materials in [a] briefcase. He put his briefcase on the top of
his car and drove off and the briefcase broke open . . . and the OT materials
were drifting down the Hollywood freeway. . . . So there were several instances
where they were simply lost." Young cited a sheaf of news stories, dating back
to 1977, which he said revealed some of the secrets of the OT materials. </P>

<P>And what secrets they are. According to various published accounts of the
material, Hubbard wrote that 75 million years ago, a galactic ruler named Xenu
(sometimes called Xemu) banished to Earth (then known as Teegeeack) spirits
called thetans, which were implanted in volcanoes. The volcanoes exploded and
the thetans invaded mankind, accounting for our ills. "Xemu's Cruel Response to
Overpopulated World," headlined one account of the OT materials, a 1988 story
in the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. (Strangely, despite the secrecy surrounding
the OT levels, Hubbard told the basic Xenu story in "Revolt in the Stars," a
screenplay he tried to sell in the early 1980s, according to Young.) The
materials also contain Hubbard's precise instructions for reversing the damage
done by the galactic cataclysm. </P>


<P>After Hubbard's death in 1986, his estate licensed the copyrights to the OT
materials to a church organization called the Religious Technology Center,
which McShane heads. The RTC has ardently protected the material. "Wherever
these documents have cropped up," testified McShane, "we have sued." In 1983,
for instance, a onetime Hubbard associate named David Mayo broke off from
Scientology and established a new church, called The Church of the New
Civilization. Mayo used materials similar to Scientology's OT scriptures in his
new church; Scientology sued in 1985, alleging that Mayo was in cahoots with
the Europeans who had stolen OT writings. </P>

<P>Also that year, attorneys for a former Scientologist named Lawrence
Wollersheim -- who has been enmeshed in litigation with Scientology for ten
years and is currently a defendant in one of the Internet cases -- got copies
of the OT levels indirectly from someone in The Church of the New Civilization.
Three days after the Los Angeles superior court judge overseeing Wollersheim's
case refused to seal the materials, Scientology sued Wollersheim and his
lawyers in federal court, claiming racketeering and trade secret
misappropriation. </P>

<P>The case was eventually dismissed, but not before the Ninth Circuit ruled
that Scientology's OT materials were not trade secrets, because the church had
posited their worth as spiritual, rather than economic. Several years later,
Scientology heeded the Ninth Circuit's comments and claimed that a former
Scientologist named Enid Vien, who was using OT materials in Scientology-like
courses she was teaching, was causing the church economic harm, because the
church depended on the fixed donations Scientology asked parishioners to pay
for the privilege of studying the OT levels. Church lawyer Kobrin says she
knows of no other religion that has sought court rulings that its scriptures
are trade secrets, but in a 1993 ruling in the Vien case, San Diego U.S.
district court judge Marilyn Huff granted Scientology summary judgment on its
trade secret claims. She also found that Vien had infringed Scientology's
copyrights. </P>

<P>That same year, however, another former Scientologist -- convicted felon
Steven Fishman -- dumped about 65 pages of OT materials into the record in a
defamation case the church had filed against him for comments he made in
<I>Time</I> reporter Richard Behar's 1991 cover story, "Scientology: The Cult
of Greed." Fishman claims he bought the documents from a Scientology staffer
who needed the money to continue progressing through the OT levels, and that he
put the materials in the record to demonstrate Scientology's coercive mind
control techniques. The church maintains that Fishman did not buy the
documents, but somehow got them from a lawyer representing another defendant in
his case, who contrived to get the materials into the record after the case was
dismissed and the record unsealed. Fishman's intent, the church alleges, was
blackmail. </P>

<P>But the judge overseeing the Fishman case refused to reseal the record, as
did the Ninth Circuit, which remanded the issue to the trial court for further
review. Ever resourceful, the church marshaled qualified Scientologists to
control the court file. Every morning, a Scientologist would sign out the file.
For the rest of the day, every day the court was open and the file unsealed,
Scientologists kept watch over it. The church maintains that thanks to this
remarkable effort, only one copy of the Fishman papers was ever made, by a
reporter for <I>The Washington Post</I>. </P>


<H3>OT Hits the Internet</H3> 

<P>In late November or early December 1994 messages started appearing in an
Internet discussion group called <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>, which since
its founding in 1991 had become a hotbed of debate between former, current, and
wavering Scientologists. Sent anonymously by <I>nobody@replay.com</I>, an
address that prevented tracing, the messages purported to contain the OT
materials. </P>

<P>The "nobody" postings caught the attention of Dennis Erlich, a former
Scientology minister who had begun to participate in
<I>alt.religion.scientology </I> the previous summer. Erlich had spent 15 years
in the church, ultimately completing seven OT levels and serving, he says, as
"chief cramming officer," overseeing what he asserts was brainwashing by the
church. Erlich has been a vociferous critic since before he left in the church
in 1982, amassing a Scientology library and ministering, he says, to former
Scientologists in need of counseling. </P>

<P>Erlich leapt into <I>alt.scientology.religion</I> with a fury, posting 20 or
30 messages a day. In the newsgroup, says netizen Ron Newman, who was an
occasional <I>alt.religion.scientology</I> participant in those days, Erlich
was abrasive and confrontational, but likeable. "He was rude to someone if they
deserved it," Newman says. </P>

<P>"It was a handful of Scientologists chatting with a handful of skeptics,"
says Erlich. "I got in [the Scientologists'] faces real quick. I stayed in
their faces till they had to shut me up." Erlich frequently accompanied his
postings with Scientology written material that he scanned into his computer
from books and pamphlets he says he has collected from public sources since he
left the church. In August Erlich got a letter from a lawyer named Thomas Small
of Los Angeles's Small Larkin & Kidde, one of the church's regular outside
intellectual property lawyers, warning him that he was infringing Scientology
copyrights. He got another letter in September. Erlich ignored the warnings.
</P>

<P>In December, when Erlich saw that the anonymously posted OT materials were
authentic, he reposted them, with brief comments affirming that they were the
real thing. "I just sort of signed my name to each one with a cursory
explanation for the wogs [a Scientology word for non-Scientologists]," Erlich
says. </P>

<P>The church responded with an e-mail letter, dated December 28 and signed by
Small but sent from the Internet account of Scientology lawyer Helena Kobrin.
"Actions will be taken against you and all of those who have participated with
you or contributed to your infringements," the letter said. "This includes
those who provide the systems and services through which your postings are
made. It will be in your best interest to remove any unauthorized postings and
refrain from any further postings of our clients' materials or we will have no
other option but to go forward with litigation against you." </P>

<P>Following up on the threat in the letter to Erlich, church lawyer Kobrin
sent a letter the next day to <a href=http://www.netcom.com>Netcom On-Line
Communications Services, Inc</a>., the Internet access provider used by
<I>support.com</I>, the bulletin board Erlich subscribed to. According to
Netcom counsel Randolf Rice of The Genesis Law Group in San Jose, Kobrin
demanded that Netcom cut off Erlich's access to the Internet. The next day
Kobrin contacted Tom Klemesrud, the systems operator of <I>support.com</I>,
alleging copyright infringement by Erlich. </P>

<P>If any one of the three had responded to the church's demands and Erlich's
infringing posts had stopped appearing, says Kobrin, there would have been no
litigation. "The only thing we are looking for is to protect our materials,"
she says. "If people rectify [the infringements], we do not sue." </P>


<H3>"Harassing Threats" </H3>

<P>Kobrin, 47, is the lawyer who has become the most closely associated with
Scientology's Internet cases -- and who has been subjected to the ugliest
vitriol from netizens offended by them. Kobrin grew up on New York's Long
Island, went to Hofstra University, got married, had kids, and graduated from
Seton Hall University School of Law, where she was editor in chief of the law
review. She practiced in Florida for a while before she joined the Church of
Scientology, but, according to a letter she wrote to <I>The American Lawyer</I>
in response to "The Two Faces of Scientology" (July/August 1992), grew
disenchanted with her law practice. "I did not want to practice law if I could
not feel my work was contributing to the improvement of humanity," she wrote.
"My own father was a refugee from Germany and my grandparents were killed by
the Nazis. As a result, my interest in religious freedom and social reform has
always been strong." </P>

<P>Kobrin began working as a lawyer for a Florida Scientology church in the
mid-1980s, a practice she says she found meaningful. In 1990 she moved to Los
Angeles and joined Bowles & Moxon, a small firm that essentially served as the
church's in-house legal department. Kobrin developed an intellectual property
expertise, working on the Vien, Mayo, and Wollersheim cases in the early 1990s.
She set up her own shop in 1995 when Bowles & Moxon disbanded. </P>

<P>Kobrin has none of the bombast of longtime Scientology lawyer Earle Cooley
of Boston's Cooley, Manion, Moore & Jones, who was lead trial counsel in the
early stages of all the Internet cases. On the phone she is courteous and
professional, though occasional flashes of anger make it clear: She is dead
serious about protecting her church's sacred writings. </P>

<P>When Scientologists first saw the anonymously posted scriptures, Kobrin
says, church lawyers contacted the poster's remailer, but were unable to
identify "nobody." When Erlich reposted the materials, however, the church
recognized his name right away. </P>

<P>"He had tried to stir up trouble in the past with wild and false
allegations. He has also been associated with other groups doing this," Kobrin
asserts, referring to the Cult Awareness Network, Scientology's nemesis and a
group to which Erlich has ties. Indeed, Kobrin says, it is a measure of the
church's integrity in these cases -- proof that the church's sole purpose is
the protection of its copyrights and trade secrets -- that the church didn't
attempt in any way to censor Dennis Erlich until <I>after</I> he posted
copyrighted materials. </P>

<P>In response to the church's late December demands, Erlich, Netcom, and
Erlich's system operator, Klemesrud, all refused to give assurances that the
alleged copyright infringement wouldn't happen again. Erlich e-mailed a letter
back saying, "I do not appreciate your threats. I am exercizing [sic] my rights
as a citizen of the United States. If you have a problem with that, do whatever
you intend to do. Do not send me any more of these unsubstantiated, harassing
threats." Klemesrud told Kobrin that he would consider deleting materials from
his bulletin board, but only if he were sent a copy of the originals so he
could confirm that the postings were infringing. Kobrin, asserting that the
materials were trade secrets, refused to do so. </P>

<P>Netcom referred Kobrin to its outside counsel, Michael Sullivan of the Menlo
Park office of San Francisco's Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, who eventually told
Kobrin that Netcom couldn't cut off Erlich's access to the Internet without
cutting off all 500 subscribers to Klemesrud's bulletin board. Netcom did not
review Erlich's posts before Sullivan responded to Kobrin. </P>


In January 1995 Kobrin tried another route to squelch the problem, sending out
a message to servers providing access to the Usenet, where the
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I> discussion group is located. Kobrin informed
servers that the group was started by someone with a forged message; that it
violated Scientology's intellectual property rights to the very word
"Scientology"; and that it was a haven for Scientology critics. She requested
that Usenet servers cancel the newsgroup. 

<P>"We were not, at the time, sophisticated about the Internet," says Kobrin.
"Somebody said, 'If there's a group, you can shut it down.' The group was
started through forgery . . . and since the group was improperly formed, we
thought we could cancel it. Obviously we didn't accomplish that." </P>


<H3>The Internet Awakes</H3> 

<P>News of Kobrin's attempt to remove the group went out to other discussion
groups, attracting people who had no previous interest in Scientology to
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I>. Jon Noring, an Internet personality who in
1994 had initiated a petition to Intel asking the company to recall and replace
defective Pentium chips, started an Internet petition protesting Scientology's
attempts to censor the discussion group. Netizen Ron Newman, who had
occasionally browsed in <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>, heard about Kobrin's
attempt to cancel the newsgroup, and, he says, "I said, 'I'm in this for the
long haul.' " Newman was known by Internet cognoscenti for his efforts to
curtail on-line advertisements by two Arizona lawyers; after Kobrin tried to
shut down <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>, he helped organize a group to track
down the "cancelbunny," someone who appeared to be canceling postings to
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I> that were critical of Scientology. </P>

<P>Computer science professor Richard Cleek of the University of Wisconsin
Centers joined Newman's hunt. "This was an outrageous and unprecedented set of
behaviors," says Cleek, who later became a defense witness in two of the
Internet cases. "This was a threat to the essence of the Net -- the thing that
makes it work so well. The core of the Net is the freedom to create a newsgroup
on any subject you want, and the freedom of access. This was an orchestrated
attack. That was disturbing." </P>

<P>In the somewhat anarchic culture that prevails in parts of the Internet, the
Scientology attack roused passions. Some of these netizens, after all, are as
devoted to their cause as Kobrin is to hers. "A lot of us hold the Net to be
sacred in the same way they hold the OT materials to be sacred," says Newman.
"To some of us, preserving the Net for free speech is more important than
anything in the free world." </P>

<P>As Internet discussion groups buzzed with the news about Scientology, a
computer lexicographer named Grady Ward tuned in. "I was raised to believe that
[freedom of speech] is sacrosanct," says Ward, a free speech zealot who once
distributed a National Security Agency employee manual over the Internet. He
began reading <I>alt.religion.scientology</I> in January, and quickly became a
dedicated follower and poster. He spent hours and hours studying Scientology
writings, and developed into an ardent critic of the church, posting sometimes
disgustingly obscene attacks on Kobrin. Like Newman, Ward portrays his battle
with Scientology as a moral quest. "I never served in Vietnam," he says. "I
feel I owe a couple years of service to my country. This is my service to my
country -- I'm defending the Constitution." </P>


<H3>The First Suit </H3>

<P>Speech isn't free, however, when it is the property of someone else. In
Scientology's view, the OT materials unquestionably belong to the church, and
the church doesn't care to share them publicly. In fact, the church badly needs
to maintain the mystery surrounding its scriptures. As McShane, president of
the church organization that owns the rights to the material, has admitted, the
writings can seem weird to those who don't have the requisite Scientology
training. Making them public, argued church trial counsel Cooley at one
hearing, could dissuade Scientologists from paying the "fixed donations" the
church requires its parishioners to pay for the privilege of studying the
scriptures -- and could convince potential Scientologists not to join the
church. </P>

<P>Indeed, Cooley thundered at the hearing, the aim of the former
Scientologists was nothing less than the destruction of the church. "The plan
is to take those [secret] upper-level materials and expose them before their
time and before people are ready," Cooley said, "so as to ridicule and demean
the Church of Scientology. . . . The intention [is] to wipe out the religion by
strangling it financially and destroying its rights." </P>

<P>So on February 7, 1995, Scientology lawyers went to federal court in San
Jose, seeking an ex parte restraining order against Erlich, Netcom, and
Klemesrud. Erlich had copied at least 154 pages of copyrighted and secret
material onto the Internet, the church alleged, and there was every reason to
believe he would continue to make infringing postings. Netcom and Klemesrud,
church lawyers maintained, were contributing to Erlich's infringment by
allowing him access to the Internet, even after the church notified them of
Erlich's violations. "Ehrlich has commenced and is continuing an insidious
campaign of copyright infringement and trade secrets misappropriation," the
church asserted. "[He] has been enabled in this respect by Klemesrud and
Netcom. </P>

<P>Scientology has long had its own unique view of litigation. Hubbard, in a
bit of writing since disavowed by the church but often cited by lawyers who
oppose Scientology, advised that litigation is intended "to harass and
discourage rather than to win. The law can be used very easily to harass, and .
. . will generally be sufficient to cause [an opponent's] professional decease.
If possible, of course, ruin him utterly." Certainly the church has never been
shy about litigating with an aggressiveness that makes tobacco companies look
like patsies: swamping dockets with pleadings, appealing everything,
relitigating everything, hurling accusations of insanity or worse at opponents,
and even investigating and suing the lawyers who represent those opponents.
</P>

<P>The Internet cases have been no exception. At the same time they asked for
an ex parte restraining order against Erlich and his access providers, Kobrin
and the other church lawyers also sought a writ of seizure against Erlich,
arguing that they needed to impound whatever Scientology materials he
possessed. Such writs are relatively common in counterfeiting cases -- in which
someone is manufacturing knockoffs of, say, Rolex watches or Louis Vuitton
handbags -- and have come to be used frequently in cases of software piracy.
Scientology's Kobrin points out that software companies often give no warning
before raids, and espouse a "scorched-earth" policy. Scientology, she says,
tried everything it could to avert a seizure but was forced into action by the
intransigence of Erlich, Klemesrud, and Netcom. </P>

<P>"My sense of it is that [the church] had their backs against the wall," says
William Hart of the New York office of Los Angeles's <a
href=http://www.phjw.com/>Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker</a>, who recently
began representing the church in its intellectual property cases. "They felt
they had to do this." </P>


<P>But lawyers for the defendants in the Internet cases say seizures are
<I>extremely </I> rare when there is no allegation that the infringer is using
copyrighted material for economic gain. (Indeed, even church counsel Eric
Lieberman of New York's Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman says
he cannot think of a precisely analogous case.) Says Carla Oakley of San
Francisco's <a href=http://lawlinks.com/attys/ca/mf.html>Morrison &
Foerster</a>, who is representing Erlich <I>pro bono</I>: "In circumstances
like this it's quite extraordinary." </P>

<P>Nevertheless, U.S. district court judge Ronald Whyte granted the ex parte
writ of seizure, allowing Scientology to take possession of anything written by
L. Ron Hubbard that Erlich had in his possession, from files on his computer
hard drive to published Scientology texts. </P>

<P>On February 13, 1995, accompanied by a Glendale, California, police officer,
a group that included Scientology lawyer Thomas Small and church official
Warren McShane arrived at Erlich's house. The police officer, according to
Erlich, departed after an hour or two, leaving two off-duty policemen to
supervise the seven-hour search of his house. "[Scientology] representatives
personally copied materials from Mr. Erlich's computer and deleted information
from the hard drive," Erlich's MoFo lawyers asserted in their answer to the
church's complaint. "The materials taken from Mr. Erlich's home and deleted
from his hard disk included many, many more materials than are described in the
writ of seizure . . . including private and confidential information regarding
Mr. Erlich's acquaintances, his taxes, finances, and his research efforts."
</P>

<P>"Fox [television] had a camera crew who videoed me begging the Glendale
Police not to let them confiscate my material without me examining the disks
and copies to see specifically what they were taking," Erlich asserted in a
post to <I>alt.religion.scientology</I> after the raid. "I was refused the
right to even look at what they had copied from my disk. Criminals being
arrested have more rights than these officers of my hometown and of the court
provided me." </P>

<P>The amended complaint filed by church lawyers on March 3, 1995, alleged
Erlich had infringed copyrights on both published and unpublished church
materials, and had misappropriated trade secrets by posting the OT materials.
The church also made sweeping allegations against Klemesrud and Netcom,
asserting that the bulletin board and the Internet access provider were
<I>directly</I> liable for infringing its copyrights as well. Erlich's posts
were sent from his computer to Klemesrud's, which stored the messages for a few
days and also created an additional copy that was sent to Netcom. Netcom, in
turn, stored the data on its computer, and copied and distributed the postings
to the destination Erlich intended, the Scientology discussion group. This
computer copying, the church argued, infringed its copyrights. </P>


<H3>OT Hide-and-Seek</H3> 

<P>Lieberman and Hart, outside intellectual property lawyers for the church,
maintain that Scientology has behaved like any other plaintiff trying to
protect copyrights, and that there is strong precedent in copyright law for
both the seizure and the attempt to hold access providers liable. But segments
of the Internet community were not interested in the fine points of copyright
law: If Kobrin's January effort at wiping out <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>
had riled the Internet world, the raid on Erlich and the church's argument that
Netcom and Klemesrud were direct infringers -- an argument that, if the courts
agreed, could cripple the Internet -- sent some netizens into a frenzy. </P>

<P>"People arrived [on <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>] that I'd never heard of
before," says Newman. "If Scientology had sued Dennis without raiding him, it
wouldn't have stirred things up. This would be a tempest in a teapot. But the
raid and the suit on the [Internet service providers] heated it up." </P>

<P>"[The raid] seemed to be a remedy so out of the bounds of the alleged rights
of copyright," says free speech fanatic Grady Ward. "It galvanized me and a
thousand people on the Net." </P>

<P>And now, netizens weren't just posting petitions or tuning in to
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I> to grouse about Scientology. People began
posting and downloading snippets of OT materials, mostly one six- or seven-line
extract considered to be particularly ridiculous.Trying to get a letter from
Kobrin became the object of a game, says Newman. Netizens started Web pages
critical of the church; Newman, for instance, set up a highly detailed page at
<a
href=http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html><I>http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html</I></a>

with links to documents and people involved in the litigation. Kobrin got her
own "pen pals" page, featuring an awful picture, various nasty jingles written
about her, and a haiku calling her "official Usenet kook" and citing an obscene
nickname Grady Ward coined for her. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group
devoted to preserving on-line freedom of speech, began an on-line archive of
documents from the Erlich/Netcom case. (The site, at <a
href=http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/CoS_v_the_Net><I>http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/CoS_v_the_Net/</I></a>,
now includes documents from all three cases. The church's site is at <a
href=http//www.theta.com/relfreedom><I>http//www.theta.com/relfreedom</I></a>.)
More and more people began uploading affidavits, declarations, and pleadings
from court cases involving Scientology. Former Scientologists were treated as
heroes. </P>

<P>The church, in other words, had made enemies of a host of people who had
previously not even registered its existence. </P>

<P>Most damagingly to the church, the secret OT scriptures were cropping up all
over the place. An anonymous poster called "Scamizdat" spent the spring and
summer of 1995 posting the documents at sites all over the Internet. (Grady
Ward is one Scamizdat suspect, and the church sent representatives to his house
to talk to him about the error of his ways; a private investigator hired by
church lawyers has also questioned Ward associates.) Church lawyers, says
Kobrin, were able to persuade a lot of access providers to remove infringing
postings, but sophisticated computer users, says Wisconsin computer science
professor Cleek, knew that simply by searching for the word "Scamizdat" with a
good search engine, they could find OT materials. As recently as September
1995, Cleek testified, you could find Scamizdat's OT postings if you knew how
to look. </P>

<P>"It was like the Sorcerer's apprentice," says former Scientologist Robert
Vaughn Young. "Every time they chopped it up it reappeared. . . . It was just
all over the place. Net people were delighting in the anarchy. The Internet is
to Scientology what Vietnam was to the United States -- no matter how much you
bombed, no matter how much you attacked, it just got worse." </P>


<H3>Catching The Fishman Declaration </H3>

<P>One beneficiary of the anti-Scientology fervor was Steve Fishman, the
convicted felon who had dumped about 65 pages of OT materials into an unsealed
court record. Fishman became a household name on the Internet -- and, despite
the church's extraordinary vigil over the OT materials he had leaked, somehow,
by July, the Fishman materials were out on the Internet. Cleek testified that a
Carnegie Mellon University professor posted them on a Web page in July and left
them up for two days before he was forced to remove them. At various times,
Cleek testified, they were available on two German sites, one Finnish site, and
even a Beijing site for several hours. </P>

<P>Then, on August 1 and 2, 1995, the Fishman OT materials became available
right on <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>. They were posted there, without
comment, by a former Scientologist named Arnaldo Lerma. </P>

<P>Like Erlich, Lerma had spent years in the church, including seven as a
member of the high-ranking Sea Organization. Lerma says his church duties
included trying to sell high-priced church services to members, and that he
depended on the church for food, clothes, and housing. </P>

<P>Lerma left Scientology in 1977; he says he and one of Hubbard's daughters
fell in love, and Hubbard disapproved. He eventually moved to Virginia and set
up an electronics business. For almost 20 years, he says, he had virtually no
contact with Scientology or even with old friends who, like him, had left the
church. </P>

<P>Sometime in 1994 Lerma bought an Internet guide with a list of all the
discussion groups on the internet, and saw the listing for
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I>. "My motivation -- I had no interest in bashing
Scientology," he insists. "I wanted to meet up with old friends." Nevertheless,
Lerma told his on-line acquaintances that he had a scanner, and people began
sending him hard copies of court documents critical of Scientology, which he
scanned into his hard drive and then posted. All told, he posted hundreds of
pages of court documents to <I>alt.religion.scientology</I> between July 1994
and July 1995. </P>

<P>Last July Lerma was invited to join the board of <a 
href=http://www.lightlink.com/factnet1/>F.A.C.T.Net</a>, a nonprofit, on-line
archive and library of information on groups engaged in coercive mind control.
F.A.C.T.Net's then-executive director was none other than Larry Wollersheim,
the onetime Scientologist whose lawyers had been sued in the 1980s by the
church for getting hold of the OT materials. Wollersheim, who won a
multimillion-dollar verdict against the church in his state court case, had
amassed a huge library of Scientology documents, including the OT materials
from his case and a copy of the Fishman materials (he was to have been an
expert witness in the Fishman case had it not been dismissed). And though
F.A.C.T.Net purports to collect information on any group it believes to be a
cult, its specialty is Scientology material. F.A.C.T.Net's board frequently
featured well-known Scientology critics, including former Sea Organization
member Gerald Armstrong and Jon Atack, author of an unauthorized Hubbard
biography. </P>


<P>Sometime after join-ing F.A.C.T.-Net, Lerma began scanning in a document
that he had previously received in the mail, a declaration by Steve Fishman
attached to about 65 pages of OT writings. </P>

<P>Lerma's account of where the document came from has changed. He first said
in a declaration that he believed, after a conversation with Wollersheim, that
the Fishman materials had come from F.A.C.T.Net's archives. He later said he
thought another Scientology critic had sent them, and now he says he's not
absolutely sure <I>who </I> sent them to him. But he checked out the document
to see if it seemed authentic -- it did -- and called Kemp Harshman, a friend
who is a civil liberties lawyer, to see if there was any reason why he
shouldn't post something that was in a public court file. He says he got
assurances from Harshman that he was okay. (Harshman confirms Lerma's account,
although he says he didn't realize copyrighted materials were part of the
document.) So Lerma scanned the materials into his computer, posted them to
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I> (without comment), and also e-mailed a copy to
F.A.C.T.Net. </P>

<P>The church, according to counsel Earle Cooley, was by then monitoring
<I>alt.religion.scientology</I> 24 hours a day, on the lookout for what it
deemed illicit postings. On August 3 Lerma got a letter from Melvin Jager of
Chicago's <a href=http://www.portal.com/~recorder/willad.html>Willian Brinks
Hofer Gilson & Lione</a>, whom the church had brought in for additional
intellectual property firepower. Lerma was also visited by two women from the
church who tried to convince him to stop his posting. </P>

<P>Like Netcom and Klemesrud in the Erlich case, Lerma's access provider, a
small operation called <a href=http://www2.dgsys.com/>Digital Gateway Systems,
Inc.</a>, was notified of Lerma's alleged infringement. Digital Gateway's
president, Robert Carter, spoke to Kobrin, telling her -- just as Klemesrud had
-- that he needed to see a copy of the original works to see if Lerma was
violating copyrights. By the time Kobrin and Carter spoke again, several days
had passed, and Lerma's postings were no longer stored on Digital Gateway's
system. Moreoever, Lerma had assured Digital Gateway by letter that he didn't
intend to make infringing postings in the future. </P>

<P>Nevertheless, on August 11 Scientology lawyers Cooley and Kobrin, as well as
lawyers from the Willian Brinks firm, appeared in the Alexandria, Virginia,
courtroom of U.S. district court judge Leonie Brinkema, seeking an ex parte
temporary restraining order against Lerma and Digital Gateway, and a writ of
seizure against Lerma (a Virginia resident). Brinkema held a brief hearing, at
which Cooley asserted that Lerma was posting "out of spite," and as long as he
had the copyrighted material, the church couldn't be sure he wouldn't post it
again. Cooley assured Brinkema that the seizure would be limited, and that
independent computer experts would supervise the search of Lerma's electronic
data. Cooley did not mention that Lerma's post was a publicly available court
document. Brinkema issued the writ. </P>

<P>On August 12 Cooley, Kobrin, church official McShane, two federal marshals,
and the church's hired computer experts raided Lerma's house and carted off
boxes of his things. "I was muttering, 'And this is a church?'" Lerma says.
"Warren McShane was going through my underwear drawer. I felt the way a lady
would feel after being raped." </P>

<P>Three days later F.A.C.T.Net issued a statement supporting Lerma. Although
the on-line archive espouses a policy of not distributing copyrighted material
publicly, directors Wollersheim and Robert Penny, another former Scientologist,
said Lerma had made the posts as a F.A.C.T.Net director, and that the Fishman
materials would encourage the sort of public knowledge and debate F.A.C.T.Net
fostered. Moreover, the statement said, these civil raids were a brutal attempt
by Scientology to shut down its critics. "The response of those trying to
protect public dialog and the libraries and archives that preserve the
information for this debate must be OVERWHELMING!" the statement said.
"F.A.C.T.Net and a corps of emergency volunteers needs to immediately begin
putting up 100-1,000 times more Fishman affidavit-type public records on
Scientology into worldwide distribution on the Internet. Scientology needs to
learn that attacking critics, illegal and immoral raids, do not work anymore."
</P>

<P>Armed with F.A.C.T.Net's call for continued copyright infringement,
Scientology lawyers went to federal court in Denver on August 21, seeking an ex
parte TRO and a writ of seizure against F.A.C.T.Net, Wollersheim, and Penny.
With hardly a question, Judge Lewis Babcock granted the writ. The subsequent
raid shut down F.A.C.T.Net's bulletin board system. Thousands of files were
seized from Penny and Wollersheim, whose computer hard drive was searched for
files containing not only words that would lead to the OT materials, but also
for Grady Ward's name and the names of lawyers in cases Wollersheim was an
expert in. </P>

<P>And the church still wasn't done with its August blitzkrieg: The day after
filing the F.A.C.T.Net suit, the church amended its complaint in the Virginia
case, adding as defendants <I>The Washington Post</I> and two of its reporters.
Lerma had been a source for one of the <I>Post</I> reporters, and had sent him
copies, both paper and electronic, of the Fishman materials before they were
seized. From information it got off Lerma's hard drive after the raid on his
house, the church found out about the <I>Post's</I> copies, and asked that the
newspaper turn over the hard copy. The newspaper complied. But a <I>Post</I>
stringer went to the courthouse where the still-unsealed Fishman declaration
was on file, and obtained a copy of the court record. She sent the materials
back to Washington, and the <I>Post</I> carried a story about Scientology's
Internet offensive on August 19, quoting briefly three phrases from the Fishman
materials, a total of 46 words. Those 46 words, Scientology argued, constituted
copyright infringement -- and, the church claimed, reflected a long-lasting
vendetta against the church carried out by one of the Post reporters. </P>


<H3>Protecting Its Rights or Silencing Its Critics? </H3>

<P>Scientology's Internet cases have raised all sorts of knotty legal questions
about copyrights, trade secrets, and the Internet: When are civil searches and
seizures appropriate, and how can computers be searched in a way that protects
everyone's rights? Can materials that have been published all over the Internet
be trade secrets? What constitutes fair use of copyrighted material on an
Internet discussion group? And what is the liability of Internet access
providers in cases of copyright infringement? </P>

<P>Yet at the core of Scientology's Internet cases is a question of motive. Why
has the church litigated these cases so provocatively? Scientology lawyers and
church board members have always maintained that the church's only intention in
the three Internet cases is enforcing its legitimate copyrights, not silencing
its critics. "The best way of analyzing this," says Scientology counsel Cooley,
"is to look at what it took for the church to initiate litigation. There were
thousands of postings to newsgroups, to <I>alt.religion.scientology</I>.
Vicious allegations were made about people who happen to be Scientologists.
Only after infringing material was posted did the church sue. . . . The debate
continues, and the debate can continue." </P>

<P>Kobrin, who has been the subject of some of the vicious attacks, gets
furious when she's asked if the litigation is a means of squelching debate
about Scientology. "I find [those allegations] revolting," she says. "Nothing
could be further from the truth. . . . Erlich had been mouthing off about the
church for years. It took them posting [the copyrighted] materials that pushed
us to a point where we sued them. What we're trying to do is protect our
intellectual property rights, period." </P>

<P>The netizens who see it differently, Kobrin says, in an argument that
resonates with truth, "are not dealing with reality. . . . There are rules and
laws we all have to live by. Most of these people, they wouldn't go into a
public library and photocopy books and sell them. But they think this is a
whole new ballgame and different rules apply." </P>

<P>Even in suing the Internet access providers, argues outside church counsel
Lieberman of Rabinowitz, Boudin, the church showed restraint. Lieberman insists
that the church only intended for providers to be liable once they are notified
of infringement, not for the passive copying that is a necessary part of
Internet operations. "The church took the middle position," he says. "This
litigation is not directed at criticism [of the church], libelous and
defamatory though it may be, but at the intellectual property violations. The
church is getting a bum rap on this." </P>

<P>The defendants and their lawyers, however, are convinced that the church
used the raids to intimidate and gather information on Scientology critics, and
sued access providers so that other Internet service providers wouldn't ask so
many questions when the church made complaints about copyright violations. As
Digital Gateway's attorney, Michael Grow of the Washington, D.C., office of
Columbus's <a href=http://www.vssp.com/>Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease</a>,
wrote in a brief seeking summary judgment in the Lerma case in Virginia: "[The
church] had no valid basis for naming DGS as a party in this case, and it
obviously did so only to intimidate other [Internet service providers] and to
deter them from leasing their equipment to critics such as Lerma." (Digital has
since settled with Scientology; terms of the settlement, says Grow, are
confidential.) </P>

<P>The suit against the <I>Post</I>, argues its lawyer, Charles Sims of New
York's Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, was further evidence that
Scientology's true motive was intimidation. Sims calls the suit "an outrage,"
and wrote in his summary judgment brief that it "practically defines the
circumstances where an award to a defendant is warranted. . . . Bringing suit
on the August 19 article cannot possibly be considered objectively reasonable.
In addition, the Court has experienced firsthand the apparent intention of the
[church] to bury its opponents, and the court, in paper. The [church] has to
get the message sometime that the courts of this nation are not appropriate
vehicles for venting frustration against one's critics." (Judge Brinkema
agreed; in a November 28 ruling she dismissed the <I>Post</I> case and awarded
the newspaper attorneys' fees.) </P>

<P>Even Brinkema came to suspect the church's intentions. In a November 29
ruling she wrote: "When the RTC first approached the court with its ex parte
request for the seizure warrant and temporary restraining order, the dispute
was presented as a straightforward one under copyright and trade secret law.
However, the court is now convinced that the primary motivation of RTC . . . is
to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics." </P>

<P>Certainly the netizens sent into a frenzy by the church's tactics never
doubted that Scientology's true goal had always been to shut down people like
Erlich and Lerma. Whether or not it's true, the enmity the church had inspired
among them -- and the ensuing sport that netizens made of posting the church's
scriptures -- colored the litigation as Scientology's Internet cases progressed
in Colorado, Virginia, and California. </P>

<H3>
Three Courts, One View: 
<BR>
They're Not Secrets </H3>

<P>Thomas Kelley, a First Amendment partner in the Denver office of
Minneapolis's <a href=http://www.faegre.com/>Faegre & Benson</a>, was hired by
F.A.C.T.Net's insurance carrier to represent the on-line library. Entering the
F.A.C.T.Net case after the August 22 raid on Wollersheim and Penny, Kelley and
the Faegre & Benson team he assembled had about two weeks to prepare for a
preliminary injunction hearing. They plunged into Scientology's extensive
litigation history -- including the decade of bitter fighting between the
church and Wollersheim -- the intricacies of Internet operations, and the tale
of Xenu and the volcanoes. "[This case] is very weird," Kelley says. "I used to
think it was oppressively weird, but I've gotten used to it. A lot of lawyers
have gotten very personally involved in this. I'm not personally involved --
the republic would be safe without either side of this dispute. But there are
some very important issues here." </P>


<P>For F.A.C.T.Net, a three-day preliminary injunction hearing in Denver in
mid-September resolved some of those issues. After hearing testimony from,
among others, church official Warren McShane, the church's computer expert,
Wisconsin computer science professor Richard Cleek, former Scientology official
Robert Vaughn Young, and Larry Wollersheim, U.S. district court judge John
Kane, Jr., denied Scientology's preliminary injunction motion in an
emphatically pro-F.A.C.T.Net ruling. First of all, F.A.C.T.Net hadn't infringed
the church's copyrights, Kane found. "The alleged copying by the defendants was
not of a commercial nature," he wrote in his September 15 ruling. "Rather, it
was made for nonprofit purposes to advance understanding of issues concerning
the church, which are the subject of ongoing public controversy. . . . The
postings may well be considered as having been made for the purposes of
criticism, comment, or research falling within the fair use doctrine." </P>

<P>Nor were the Fishman materials that had been posted by F.A.C.T.Net director
Arnie Lerma trade secrets, in Kane's view. Cleek had testified about the
availability of the Fishman materials on the Internet, and Robert Vaughn Young
had testified about other leaks of the OT materials; Kane ruled that the
scriptures "are widely known outside of the church through multiple sources,"
including Internet postings that pre-dated Lerma's Fishman posting. "As such,"
ruled Kane, "they are not secret." </P>

<P>Kane, who had taken over the Colorado case <I>after </I> the writ of seizure
had
been granted, also vacated the writ and ordered the church to return everything
it had seized from the F.A.C.T.Net defendants, including their hard drives.
</P>

<P>More bad news for Scientology came from Judge Brinkema, the Virginia judge
overseeing the Lerma case, on September 15. Cooley's passionate style had not
impressed Judge Kane; Brinkema was similarly irritated by his emotional
declamations about the holiness of the scriptures and the despicability of the
attacks on Scientology. From the bench she denied the church's motion for a
preliminary injunction against Lerma and Digital Gateway. Moreover, she said,
the church had violated the spirit of the writ of seizure, and so she ordered
it vacated, and Lerma's material returned to him. </P>

<P>Like Kane, Brinkema subsequently ruled that the church's scriptures were
<I>not </I>
trade secrets. "The Internet and the court file are simply public domain
entities," she said a summary judgment ruling from the bench. "When information
gets into them and stays in them for any extent of time, and certainly 28
months is a lot of time in a court file, they simply become publicly known."
</P>

<P>Relying on similar reasoning, San Jose federal Judge Ronald Whyte, in a
September 22 ruling in the third of Scientology's Internet cases -- the
Erlich/Netcom case -- also found that the church had not shown a likelihood of
success on the merits of its trade secret claims. "[Defendant Dennis] Erlich
claims that because the alleged trade secrets were received from 'public
sources,' they should lose their trade secret protection," Whyte wrote. "The
court is . . . convinced that those postings made by Erlich were of materials
that were possibly already generally available to the public." </P>

<P>Kobrin points out that both Whyte and Kane made only preliminary rulings,
and that the church still plans to make trade secret claims in those cases.
Church counsel Lieberman adds that the church plans to appeal Lerma's summary
judgment ruling on trade secrets. But it is hard to imagine how, given the
reasoning of these three judges -- and the proliferation of OT postings to the
Internet <I>after</I> the church began the litigation -- Scientology will ever
again be able to make a strong case that the OT writings that cropped up on
computers worldwide are trade secrets. According to F.A.C.T.Net defense counsel
Kelley of Faegre & Benson, that means anyone can legally possess the widely
posted OT materials -- and anyone can legally make fair use of them under the
copyright laws, even, perhaps, quoting them liberally in the context of
criticism. </P>

<H3>
Fair Game for Fair Use 
</H3>
<P>It's true that the church has had some significant wins in the litigation --
a not unexpected outcome, given the strength of Scientology's copyright claims.
San Jose judge Whyte ruled on September 22 that Dennis Erlich had not made fair
use of the copyrighted church materials. Church lawyers also celebrated Whyte's
precedent-setting November ruling, in which he found that Netcom and Klemesrud
<I>could </I> be liable for contributing to Erlich's infringement after they
had been notified of the alleged infringement by Scientology. Both Netcom and
Klemesrud had been warned, Whyte wrote, yet continued to aid Erlich's
infringement by allowing him access to the Internet. "Plaintiffs have raised a
genuine issue of fact regarding whether Netcom should have known that Erlich
was infringing their copyrights after receiving a letter from plaintiffs,"
Whyte wrote. (Netcom counsel Rice says that Whyte's ruling means Netcom had a
duty to investigate and take reasonable steps in response to Scientology's
complaint -- which, he asserts, Netcom did. "We were already following Whyte's
guidelines," he says.) </P>

<P>Virginia judge Brinkema's January 19 ruling that Lerma had infringed the
church's copyrights, resulting in a summary judgment victory for Scientology,
is probably the church's biggest win to date. It ends the case against Lerma,
who is liable for damages and, possibly, attorneys' fees. (He is appealing.)
The church brought in intellectual property heavyweight Hart from the New York
office of Los Angeles's Paul, Hastings to present its straightforward copyright
case effectively. Throughout the case Lerma's lawyers from Washington, D.C.'s 
Ross, Dixon & Masback and Faegre & Benson had tried to argue that, although
Lerma did not attach specific comments to the Fishman declaration posting,
Lerma's ongoing contributions to the debate on alt.religion.scientology made it
clear he was posting the materials for the purpose of criticism and discussion.
But Judge Brinkema was unpersuaded. (Tom Kelley of Faegre & Benson took over as
lead counsel from Lee Levine at Ross, Dixon when it became obvious that
F.A.C.T.Net's $1 million insurance policy, which was funding the defense in
both Virginia and Colorado, was being too quickly depleted by the involvement
of two firms.) </P>

<P>It is also significant that Brinkema denied Lerma's motion for summary
judgment based on the church's conduct during the search of his house. Brinkema
blamed herself for issuing an overly broad writ. Indeed, the January 19 hearing
in Judge Brinkema's courtroom was a demonstration of how easy these cases could
have been for Scientology: Even Brinkema, who had lashed out at the church in a
previous ruling, was entirely receptive to the narrow copyright claims. </P>

<P>The church maintains that its goal has always been to protect those
copyrights, and in that, it is succeeding. "The judges who have issued the
rulings in our lawsuits have already done a tremendous job to fortify the
rights of copyright owners vis-&#224;- vis the Internet," says spokeswoman
Leisa Goodman. Adds Kobrin: "The effect of these rulings is quite salutary.
[The illicit] posting has quieted down as a result of the litigation. . . .
It's foolhardy [for infringers] to continue." The church says, indeed, that it
did not engender much controversy with its tactics, and that only a handful of
zealots are responsible for the wholesale posting that went on in the spring
and summer of 1995. Moreover, says Kobrin, even that posting did not notably
impact the secrecy of the church writings; surveys of the public conducted by
polling organizations hired by the church have shown that the secret scriptures
remain secret. </P>

<P>But for how long? Because the church's tactics provoked such apparently
widespread posting of OT materials, the documents are in the hands of an
unknown number of netizens with a virulent animosity toward the church and, in
the case of Scamizdat and others, a proven willingness to flout copyright law.
They don't even have to flout the law to possess the Fishman declaration, given
Brinkema's ruling that it's not a trade secret; the Fishman materials, says
Lerma and F.A.C.T.Net's lawyer, Tom Kelley, seem to be fair game for fair use.
"I think the situation we have now," he says, "is that anybody who can get
their hands on the Fishman affidavit can possess it and make fair use of it."
</P>

<P>Kelley is quick to assert that his clients say they never intended to
infringe church copyrights, and do not support the Internet community's
sport-posting of Scientology secrets. Nevertheless, he says, "I think perhaps
the Scientologists did meet their match in the [Scamizdats] of the world." </P>

Reg.41454, 41471 (Aug.11, 1995).  FDA purports to support its usurpationofCongress' legislative prerogative by the misdirected charge that, insubstance, all cigarette manufacturers engage inproduct development researchand the "manipulation and control" of marketed cigarettes "to ensure an adequatedose of nicotine" - i.e., one that will create and maintain the "addictive andsignificant pharmacological effects: FDA claims are caused in cigarettes.  60Fed. Reg. 41582, et.seq.  As evidence, FDA points to a variety ofinternal industry documents, including some from Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation ("B&amp;W") and its affiliated company British American Tobacco Co.("BATCo.").<p>However, as demonstrated below, the B&amp;W and BATCo.documents do notsupport FDA's position.  When stripped of the distortions and false innuendosFDA attributes to the documents - when the documents are not removed fromtheir proper contexts, as RDA has done - they do not reveal the"intent" FDAaspires to demonstrate.  Rather, because smoking pleasure is a complex,multi-faceted experience, B&amp;W cannot and does not design and manufacture its productslike a pharmaceutical company which produces medications with thespecific purpose of delivering a precise dose of an active ingredient to thesite of action in the body in order to relieve or cure a specific condition.Like manufacturers of other consumer products based on agricultural commodities, B&amp;W must design and manufactureits cigarettes so that they economically and reliably meetconsumer preferences.<p>The main staple of B&amp;W products is tobacco leaf, which naturallyvaries by type.  Further, the grade, quality, and natural makeup of tobacco leaf is affected by weather, soil conditions, disease, location grown, and numerous other factors.  In the manufacturing process, B&amp;W, like other manufacturers of consumer products drawn from agricultural commodities, seeks to produce a products that is of the same, consistent high quality time after time, despite these uncontrollable variations.  This process differs dramatically from the pharmaceutical manufacturer, which takes a synthetic  drug and measures it into metered dosesin a laboratory.<p>It is also important to note that after tobacco is purchased,subsequent steps in the process of producing finished cigarettes consistentlyreduce the nicotine level in the cigarette blend below the natural nicotinelevel in the tobacco.  First the tobacco is subjected to mechanical and physicalprocesses such as physical agitation, application of moisture, drying, andexpansion, all of which result in a loss of some nicotine.  In theblending process, domestic tobaccos are blended with lower nicotine orientaltobaccos as well as lower nicotine reconstituted tobacco.  In addition,non-tobacco components such as casings and flavorings are added, furtherreducing the nicotine content of the blend.  This continual reduction of nicotinelevels further undercuts FDA's charges.<p>In the Joint Comments, B&amp;W has joined with The Tobacco Instituteand other U.S. cigarette manufacturers to demonstrate that FDA's legaldefinition of "intent" is improper under the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct("FDCA") and to refute FDA's assertions of purported fact concerning"industry" knowledge and activities.  Among other things, the Joint Commentsshow that the mild pharmacologic effect of nicotine is not sufficient to meet thelegal standard of intent to affect "the structure orany function of thebody..." 21 U.S.C. &#167; 321(g)(1)(c)(1994), and that nicotine is not "addictive"under traditional definitions.<p>In these separate comments, B&amp;W shows that its intent is to design, manufacture and market its cigarettes to meet the preferences of adult smokersover competing brands, not to create and maintain "addiction" to nicotine.FCA'sassertion to the contrary is not supported and is indeed contradicted bythe actual practices, experience, and documents of B&amp;W and BATCo.  We also show that the B&amp;W and BATCo. documents cited by FDA do not demonstrate that B&amp;W "manipulates" nicotine in its cigarettes for the purpose of "addicting"smokers.<p>People smoke for many reasons, and have done so since as early as 1604,when King James wrote perhaps the first criticism of smoking, <I> A Counterblaste to Tobacco</I>.  The reasons people smoke include a variety of social, psychological andsensory factors unrelated to any mild pharmacological effects of nicotine.Nicotine is a natural component of tobacco and is integral to tobacco smoke.It plays a part in the smoke's taste and flavor.  Smokers have rejected bothnon-tobacco products which contain nicotine and tobacco products which do notcontain nicotine.<p>Moreover, for more than 30 years, B&amp;W and BATCo. andother manufacturers have sought to respond to anticipated changes in the marketbecause of public and governmental concerns about the alleged relationshipsbetween smoking and health. Much of the B&amp;W and BATCo. research, productdevelopment, and manufacturing processes FDA cites was in fact part ofan effortto address this changing market.  This effort has resulted in dramaticreductions in cigarette tar and nicotine levels since the 1950s, as demonstratedin the Joint Comments.  FDA has sought to rewrite this history as nicotine"manipulation" of selected and distorted facts and assertions to support FDA'spre-ordained conclusion.<p><a name=one><blockquote><B>I. CONTRARY TO FDA'S ACCUSATION THAT B&amp;W SEEKS TO DELIVER "PRECISE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE," B&amp;W DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURES ITS CIGARETTESFOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE BASED UPON THE TOTAL, COMPLEX, MULTIFACETEDSMOKING EXPERIENCE.</B></blockquote></a><p>FDA asserts that "ensuring adequate nicotine delivery is acentralobjective of cigarette manufacturers."2  FDA further broadly asserts thatmanufacturers control nicotine delivery through "the design and careful,sophisticated manufacture of the cigarette, to ensure that the smoker obtains theprecise amount of nicotine intended by the manufacturer."3  As applied to thedesign and manufacture of B&amp;W cigarettes, these statements reflecta misunderstanding and distortion of the process.  As noted above, B&amp;W's goalis to make a consistent product to meet consumer preferences and ensure thatthose adults who choose to smoke select B&amp;W products.<p>B&amp;W's main objective in designing cigarettes is tocreate competitive products that smokers will prefer to those of othermanufacturers.  In addition to the primary challenge of developing preferred products, the product development personnel also work to develop innovations to maintain product quality at reduced cost, to maintain quality where productcomponents must be replaced due to unavailability of materials, and to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.<p>Products are developed and modified in order to meet consumerpreferences for the total smoking experience as measured by consumer testing.The ultimate goal is to meet the expressed preferences of current adult  consumers of tobacco products.  Nicotine is a natural component of tobacco which contributes to the taste and flavor ofsmoking along with other tobaccocomponents.  The various ingredients and design components that go intothe production of cigarettes consumers will accept and prefer result indifference levels of "tar" and nicotine delivery for different brands.  Thedelivery of a "precise amount" of nicotine is not, as FDA asserts, the goal ofthe process.<p><blockquote><B>A. Competition in the U.S. Cigarette Market Has Resulted In SeveralRecognized Product Styles, Giving Adult Smokers A Wide Choice of "Tar" Levels</B><p></blockquote>Over the last 30 years, competition within the U.S.domestic cigarettemarket has led to the development of a wide selection of product styles basedupon consumers' expressed preferences.  The major defining characteristics of these products are cigarette size, "tar" delivery, and mentholation.  The choiceof cigarette length, e.g., KingSize (80 to 85 mm) or Long (95 to 100 mm), isthe primarysize factor, although circumference is a factor for some nicheproducts.  As for "tar," a variety of "tar" delivery ranges, generallycategorized in the U.S. as full flavor(over 15 mg "tar"), light (7 to 15 mg"tar"), and ultralight (6mg "tar" or less) has been recognized by the industryand the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and is provided to accommodate consumer preferences.  The third characteristic is simply the absence or presenceof menthol.<p>Since the early 1980s, there have also been two price categories, fullrevenue and value.  One product developed in the value category and firstmarketed in 1984, GPC, has become B&amp;W's highest-selling brand.Significantly, the GPC blend is also among the lowest of B&amp;W's blends innicotine content.<p>B&amp;W and BATCo. distinguish between "research" and "product development."  Research projects are undertaken to provide broadexploration of various phenomena or theories related to cigarettes in order tobetter understand our product and to respond to governmental initiatives orperceived marketplace trends.  "Research" is not always intended to andfrequently does not lead to any practical application. "Product development" isa different process through which B&amp;W and BATCo. develop or modify actualmarketed cigarettes to compete more effectively in the marketplace.FDA, however, inappropriately supports its jurisdictional analysis with theunderlying assumption that any research theory or conclusion, regardless of howtentative it maybe, constitutes intent by B&amp;W regarding the actual useof its products.  This underlying assumption is false.<p>Most product development projects are initiated based on consumer testswhich identify weakness in preference for B&amp;W products relative tocompetition.  Others are based onopportunities to fill a gap in the market forone of the cigarette styles, for example, King size, non-menthol ultralights in acertain price range.  Finally, some product development projects seek cost improvements or material substitutions.  No products development projects are initiated, driven, guided or controlled by a desire todelivery any "precise" or "addictive" level of nicotine.<p>Once it has been decided to introduce or improve aparticular style ofcigarette, the role of product development is to formulate a product thatsmokers will choose to purchase over competitors' products.  To meet thischallenge, B&amp;W leaf blenders formulate a number oftobacco blends basedentirely upon their knowledge of smoke qualities -- i.e., flavor, irritation,and "impact" levels- of various types and grades of tobaccos.<p>In this regard, FDA mischaracterizes B&amp;W's use of the work"impact"as a euphemism for nicotine.  Such a characterization has no basis in fact."Impact" is an in-house term describing the immediate, split secondsensory perception the smoker feels at the back of the throat on inhalation ofthe smoke.  It is similar to the immediate sensation felt at the back of thethroat from the fizz ora carbonated soft drink or the spicy feel of a "hot"food.<p>In any event, after blends are selected, appropriate ingredients suchas cocoa, licorice and sugars (referred to as "casings"), humectants and flavorsare used to impart desired smoking attributes.  These blends are incorporated byproduct developers into a prototype using an appropriate combination of filter,ventilations and ciagarette paper to provide "tar" delivery within the specifiedrange of the product.  Through combinations of blends, casings and flavors, andvarious design options, a variety of prototype products is generated.<p><blockquote><B>B. Consumer Preference Testing Measures A Range Of Product AttributesTo Determine Overall Consumer Preference</B><p></blockquote>Prototypes go through several preference testing stimages designed todetermine which, if any, may warrant largescale consumer testing and,ultimately, test marketing. Potential new or changed products which survivepreference testing progress to consumer testing, which assesses the test productagainst a competitive product, an existing B&amp;W product, or, occasionally,another test product, for various sensory product attributes.  Consumers areasked to rate cigarettes for attributes such as "strength," "smootheness/harshness," "amount of tobacco taste," "amountofmenthol taste," "amount of menthol cooling," "aftertaste," "satisfaction," and"likability."<p>The terms used in consumer testing such as "strength"and "satisfaction" are not, as FDA asserts, "industry euphemisms" for thepharmacological effects of nicotine. Rather they are common-sense, plain words used to elicit from consumers their preferences with respect to the comparative sensory attributes of the cigarettes they smokein tests.  In large scaleconsumer testing, the terms are generally undefined.<p>"Satisfaction" is a word applied by consumers to eating,drinking and awhole range of human activities.  As used in B&amp;W's consumer testing, it isnot a euphemism for pharmacological response to nicotine, as wrongly asserted by FDA, but rather reflects the consumer's total reaction to the total smokingexperience delivered by the cigarettes.  Significant differences are foundin "satisfaction" ratings for cigarettes of similar smoking machine delivery of nicotine and similar physical design. Conversely, products with differing nicotine deliveries aresometimes rated similarly, in "satisfaction" when tested against each other.  Also, some smokers will rate low-nicotine products as more "satisfying" than higher nicotine products.  No conclusion aboutnicotine delivery can be drawn from use of the word "satisfaction."<p>"Strength" is also not a euphemism for nicotine level. Consumer testresults for strength and harshness are highly correlated.  Consumers rejectcigarettes, and find them unsatisfying, both for being too "strong" and not"strong" enough.<p><blockquote><B>C.  Tobacco Blend Selection, Other Components, and Design Features areAdjusted to Improve or Maintain Consumer Preference</B><p></blockquote>Based on consumer testing, product developers adjust product recipesand designs to improve or maintain product preference.  Product developersemploy blend components (i.e., different tobacco varieties and different partsofthe tobacco leaf), casings, flavorings and cigarette design features toachieve the attributes desired by consumers. To meet consumer preferences,these characteristics must be delivered on a predictable and consistent basisdespite the fact that tobacco is an agricultural product which varies based onmany factors such as soil, weather, agronomic practices, insects, and diseases. The product development effort is to make a diverse agricultural commodity intoa product that is usable and consistent in all its characteristics.<p><B>1. Tobacco Blend Selection and Purchase</B><p>Like all aspects of the product develoment process, tobacco blendselection is driven by consumer preference.  The goal is to develop a blend of tobaccos which balance sensory characteristics such as flavor quality andamplitude, irritation, and impact, so that no single attribute dominates in type or amount.  This must be accomplished within constraints of material cost,availability, and physical quality requirements.  The tobacco blend consists of  various types of tobacco leaf.  In addition, reconstituted tobacco, expandedtobacco and tobacco stem are primarily used as filler components and forutilization of tobacco that is not included in the leaf blending process toachieve cost savings.<p>The types of tobacco leaf in a blend are selected based on theirsensory characteristics (such as taste, flavor or"mouthfeel"), which varywidely among the major types of leaf and by stalk position.  It is simply nottrue, as FDA contends, that "[n]icotine is perhaps the most importantcriterion employed by cigarette companies in the purchaseof tobacco leaf" or that "stalk position" is simply a euphemism for nicotine content.4<p>Just as tobacco is selected for blending based on flavor characteristics, tobacco buyers are trained to look at a number of factors in leaf purchasing that experience shows give the best indication of flavorcharacteristics.  Higher stalk tobacco leaves do have more nicotine than lower stalk leaves on the same plant.  They also provide more flavor and have different physical characteristics.  Stalk position is the initial indicator as to whether the tobacco falls in a "flavor grade" (upper and middle stalk positions) or a"filler grade" (bottom stalk position)category.  Visual factors -- color,ripeness, length and texture -- are also checked as indications of flavor.Nicotine content of a particular tobacoo variety can vary dramatically from year to year and even farm to farm and is not evaluated at purchase.  Indeed, anaccurate pre-purchase evaluation of nicotine would be impossible given thenumber of individual tobacco farms across wide geographic areas on which tobacco is grown and the nature of the auction process.<p>The fundamental flavor characteristics of the various tobacco types and stalk positions utilized in B&amp;W blends remain relatively constant:<p>Flue Cured tobacco has a sweet, hay-like quality and lean taste withsome "nutty" type notes.  Bottom stalk leaves have an eartheir, more irritating,less flue cured character.  Top stalk leaves have more sweetness, a less earthy, more flue cured flavor character, and better balance of irritation and flavor.<p>Burley tobacco has a strong, earthy taste, and a heavy flavor with chocolate notes, and a high impact.  Bottom stalk leaves have less burley taste, more earthy flavor,less impact, and are low to medium in irritation.  Topstalk leaves have  a greater burley taste, more impact and medium to high irritation.<p>Oriental tobacco contains sweet, balsam, piney, aromatic,spicy, cedarand sour flavor notes.  Again, bottom stalk leaves will contain more of anearthy flavor, while topstalk leaves will contain more oriental flavor.<p>The taste differences between top and bottom stalk leaves are simply afact of nature.  Bottom stalk leaves have less taste, and generally have anearthier flavor.  They are the oldest leaves on the tobacco plant and are thinner than the top leaves.  However, bottom stalk leaves are important in the leafselection and blending process balance they have a high fill value due to thefluffiness of the leaf and contribute to the sensory balance of the smoke.<p>Leaf tobacco is purchased in lots, called bales in the case of burleytobacco and burlap sheets in the case of flue-cured.  Lots from all three stalk positions are purchasedby B&amp;W and used in B&amp;W blends.  FDA's contentionthat B&amp;W regularly "adjusts the stalk positions of its leaf purchases based upon the results of nicotine analyses thatare performed during the course ofthe buying season"5 is simply not true.  A B&amp;W representative stated to FDA in the  May 3, 1994 meeting FDA cites as its source that, in exceptionalcircumstances, where a drought year resulted ina particularly high-nicotinecontent, B&amp;W might attempt to adjust purchasing to buy thinner leaf to bring nicotine levels down.  According to this representative, this type of adjustmenthas occurred only twice in his 20 years of purchasing experience, and did not, and as a matter of practice, would not involve buying tobacco from a lower stalk  position.  FDA was expressly told at the May, 1994 meeting that B&amp;W had made no attempt to adjust purchasing to raise nicotine levels.  Except in the twoisolated instances where crop conditions made it necessary to attempt downwardadjustments, nicotine content is not a relevant factor in leaf purchasing.<p>Tobacco purchasing is driven by consumer demand for the sensorycharacteristics of B&amp;W products.  Consumer demand determines the content of the tobacco blends used in marketed B&amp;W cigarettes.  Contrary to FDA'scharges, nicotine is not "the most important criterion"6 employed by B&amp;W inthe purchase of tobacco leaf, nor is that leaf "blended to attain target levels of nicotine."7<p><B>2. Casings</B><p>"Casings" -- typically sugars, cocoa and licorice -- are used to ameliorate harshness, reduce irritation, and add flavor notes.<p>Historically, casings were used to protect burley tobacco againstbreak-up resulting from processing.  The word comes from the treatments - suchas molasses - applied to tobaccos to enable them to be put into a case.  Manyyears ago it was discovered that the smoke of cased burley tobacco was smoother. The use of casings is thus historically based on serendipity, notnicotine pharmacology.  Casings are not used, as the FDA asserts, "to reduce the harshness of nicotine in high-nicotine tobaccos,"8  but rather to allow use ofburley for its flavor contributions.  Burley and flue-cured tobaccos exhibit asimilar range of nicotine content, but flue-cured tobacco is palatable toconsumers in uncased form while burley is not.  There is no clear correlationbetween nicotine level and harshness.  High nicotine tobaccos do not necessarilygive a harsh smoke taste, and uncased low nicotine burley is still harsh.<p>Casings are used to modify tobacco blend attributes toimprove consumeracceptability, match benchmark product attributes, and, as in centuries past,improve processability.  Tobacco and smoke attributes modified by casings includemoisture retention (retards staleness), flexibility, smoke strength andharshness, smoke body and fullness, and flavor notes.  Each casingingredient influences one or more of the above attributes to some degree.  Theselection of casing ingredients is based onthe reduction of undesirableattributes and the addition of desirable attributes while still allowing natural tobacco flavor to dominate.  Selection of casings is not based on or related to any intent to control or increase nicotine content, nor does it have thateffect.<p><B>3. Flavors</B><p>Flavors are added to the tobacco blend to enhance natural tobaccoflavor, add missing flavor notes, provide consistency of taste, and providebrand "signature" taste. Flavors are developed and selected through aneducated trial and error process.  Total flavor weight is typically 0.1% or less of tobacco weight.  Some flavorings used until recntly contained among theiringredients tobacco extracts, which in turn contain minute amounts of nicotine. Previously, the total amount of nicotine in B&amp;W cigarettes attributable to flavoring had been estimated at approximately 2-3 ppm, an insignificant amount compared to the naturally occurring nicotine content of a typical blend ofapproximately 20,000 ppm.  The use of flavorings does not show any intent tocontrol, manipulate or raise the nicotine content of cigarettes, nor does ithave that effect.<p><B>4. Design Features</B><p>The dramatic drop in tar and nicotine levels achieved by B&amp;W and the industry as a whole since the 1059's is principally a function of productdesign.  Cigarette design refers in large part to the selection of cigaretteand tipping papers and filter materials to provide "tar" deliveries  appropriate to the particular style desired bythe consumer (full flavor, light orultra-light).  Another part of cigarette design, more related to economicfactors, is the amount of tobacco used in the cigarette - too muchis too costly, but too little is also readily perceived bythe consumer as poor physicalquality and fast burn. Reconstituted tobacco and expanded (puffy) tobaccowere developed primarily for economic purposes.  The use of ammonia  technology also enables these components to make some contribution to flavor.9<p><p><B>(a) Papers</B><p>Cigarette papers are defined in terms of their porosity and compositioncharacteristics.  More porous papers provides greater ventilation which reduces "tar" and nicotine delivery.  The variation in porosity of paper used byB&amp;W is relatively narrow.  Paper composition serves mainly to maintaincoherence of the ash.  Historically, paper composition has sometimes been used to effect slight reductions in total "tar" and nicotine delivery by reducing  the number of avilable puffs.<p><B>(b) Filters</B><p>Filters are used to decrease "tar" and nicotine delivery. Almost allcigarette filters used in the U.S. today are made from cellulose acetate fibers which are bonded together during filter manufacture by the so-called placitcizer triacetin.<p>Cellulose acetate filter material, known as filter tow, is defined interms of the size and shape of the fibers andthe number of fibers in thefilter.  The finer the fiber size, and the more of them in a filter, the greater its capability for filtering smoke aerosol particles. Commercial filtersgenerally can filter from 30% to 60% ofthe smoke aerosol.10<p>Cellulose acetate filters, however, become too hard to draw on if theycontain fiber which removes high percentimages ofthe smoke aerosol.  A majorproduct development effort inthe 1960s was for a cigarette filter which wouldreduce "tar" more than the current cellulose acetate filters but still giveacceptable draw and good taste.  By the end ofthe 1960s, filter technology had advanced to the point where it was possible to lower "tar" to 10 to 12 mgrange with acceptable draw and taste characteristics.<p> At the same time, other methods were investigated to reduce"tar"deliveries even further.  These investigations resulted in the development ofventilation technology (the provision of a number of small holds around thefilter). Ventilation was also effective to reduce carbon monoxide, which hadbecome a concern of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") and the FTC.  The development of ventilation largely supplanted the search for other special filter materials or designs.  Because of the physcial properties of each of the three substances, ventilation reduces carbon monoxide to a slightlygreater degree than "tar," and "tar" to a slightly greater degreethan nicotine.11<p>Ventilated filters enabled B&amp;W and the industry generally torespond to consumer demand for lower "tar" delivery products and to the concerns of HHS and FTC by providing an option not previously available - products with "tar" and nicotine deliveries of as low as 1 mg and 0.1 mg, respectively, asmeasured by the FTC method.  As demonstrated in the Joint Industry Comments,12 the fact that these ultra-light products have higher nicotine to tar ratios than higher tar products is due to the way ventilated filters operate according tothe laws of science, not to any manufacturer intent to "selectively reduce 'tar' while delivering a higher percentage of the available nicotine to levels thatwould not otherwise be achievable, thus extending the range of product choice.<p>FDA's focus on nicotine to "tar" ratios in ultra light products asevidence of manufacturer intent to manipulate nicotine deliveries isdisingenuous.  The extremely low "tar" and nicotine levels of ultra lightproducts are a response to consumer demand and government concerns and do notsupport any contention that manufactureres manipulate nicotine to obtain "addictive and significant pharmacological effects."  The key focus for theproductdesigner was and is to meet the market opportunity forlower "tar"products.  In the process of producing ultralight products, both "tar" andnicotine are substantially reduced.<p><B>5. Cigarette Manufacture and Quality Assurance</B><p>Once a prototype has passed through the consumer preference process andis nearly finalized, the product recipe and design are developed into a manufacturing specification. As with virtually any agriculturally basedconsumer product, the manufacturing challenge is to maintain constancy of product composition not only from day to day,but month to month and year to year despite variation inthe raw material.  Non-uniformity is likely to leadto altered taste, consumer complaints, and customer loss to competitive brands. It would also cause the product not to conform to FTC measured "tar" andnicotine delivery levels declared on packimages and in advertising toinform consumers.<p>To ensure uniformity, quality assurance procedures are developed forboth purchased materials and the various steps in the manufacturing process.These quality assurance procedures are not "nicotine manipulation."  The fact the"the nicotine content and delivery of each brand of cigarettes is remarkablyconsistent from batch-to-batch and year-to-year"14 arises out of the competitive necessity and consumer demand that B&amp;W maintain a product that isas consistent as possible given the variability of tobacco. Consumers would not buy a product that varies widely inquality from purchase to purchase.  It is no more "remarkable" for cigarette manufacturers to achieve this than theconsistency of quality achieved by any other producer of a consumer product based on an agricultural commodity, such as manufacturers of coffees, frozenorange juice  or applesauce.  Product consistency has nothing to do with nicotine pharmacology or intent to deliver a precise "addictive" level of nicotine.  Infact, tobacco products cannot be controlled for precise uniformity and thenatural variations of "tar" and nicotine even within the same brando f cigarette, will vary by as much as + or - 15%.  Nicotine ontent is not in fact amongproduct parameters specifiedand controlled by Brown &amp; Williamson as part of itsmanufacturing quality control.  "Tar" and nicotine contentof finishedcigarettes are measured as part of B&amp;W's production monitoring process toconfirm that product uniformity is being maintained and to provide warningof problems which may affect taste, or cause variance from advertised FTC "tar"and nicotine values.<p><blockquote><B>D. B&amp;W's Product Development Efforts Over the Last 40 Years HaveLed to Dramatic Declines in Nicotine Delivery</B><p></blockquote>FDA's attempt to paint every aspect of the product development andmanufacturing process as relating to nicotine ignores one fundamental point -over the last 40 years, both "tar" and nicotine deliveries in American cigarettes have declined dramatically.  As noted in the Joint Industry Comments, published data demonstrates that,since 1956, cigarette manufacturers have reduced "tar"and nicotine deliveries by over 60%.15  Both the United States Surgeon General16 and other authorities17 have recognized this trend.  B&amp;W products havedemonstrated similar reductions in "tar" and nicotine deliveries over time.<p> FDA, however, chooses to ignore this basic fact, claiming that nicotinedeliveries have increased since 1982.  As explained in the Joint IndustryComments, the data upon which these assertions are based appears to havebeen chosen and manipulated to lead to pre-determined conclusions.18<p>FDA also asserts that manufacturers have "manipulated" nicotine delivery based on FDA's failure to recognize that advances in cigarette design do not reduce "tar" and nicotine to precisely the same degree.19  As described above and in the industry response, this phenomenon is the result of the physics of ventilations and filtration, thevery tools that have allowedB&amp;W and other manufacturers to meet consumer demand for low-yield products.20  Further,FDA's reliance on nicotine/"tar" ratios to suggest thatB&amp;W or other manufacturers manipulate the level of nicotine inlow-yieldproducts wholly ignores the fundamental fact that these products provide significantly reduced "tar" and nicotine deliveries.  FDA uses nicotine/"tar"ratios to create the illusion that for nicotine, somehow less equals more.<p>B&amp;W offers a range of products with different "tar" and nicotine deliveries.  One of B&amp;W's more successful brands has a relatively low nicotine content and a relatively low nicotine/tar ratio.  B&amp;W develops andmarkets products forflavor and taste, not to deliver a precise amountof nicotine.  Smoker choice determines the mix of products actually marketed and B&amp;W's responses to government initiatives and consumer preferences over theyears have driven "tar" and nicotine yields lower and lower.<p><a name=two><blockquote><B>II. CONTRARY TO FDA'S MISCHARACTERIZATIONS, B&amp;W AND BATCo.HAVECONDUCTED RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH, INCLUDING RESEARCH INTO NICOTINE, SMOKING BEHAVIOR, AND PRODUCT DESIGN, NONE OF WHICH INDICATES INTENT BY B&amp;W OR BATCo. TO OFFER CIGARETTES AS "DRUG DELIVERY DEVICES."</B><p></blockquote></a>In the early 1950s, publication of several epidemiological andlaboratory papers escalated the smoking and health debate into a highlypublicized controversy.21  The tobacco industry in both the U.S. and the U.K.reponded broadly and responsibly to this controversy and the consequent changes in the cigarette market.  Over that time, B&amp;W and BATCo., like thescientific community generally, have conducted broad-ranging research, including that on nicotine and smoking behavior.  They have also researchedand experiemented with modifications to cigarette designs. Contrary to FDA'sassertion that the research shows that "tobacco manufacturers intendnicotine-containing cigarettes...to be used as drugs,"22 the researcheffort shave been driven by competition to meet consumer demand, the need tobetter understand the product, and, often, the need to respond to governmentinitiatives to alter design.<p>Much of this research has been of an exploratory nature to evaluate what may be technically feasible without regard to consumer acceptability or other constraints.  FDA chooses to ignore the clear distinction between such exploratory research on the one hand, and product development through which B&amp;W and BATCo. develop or modify actual marketed cigarettes on the otherhand.<p>Recognizing that without some new development to point to it cannotpossibly support its 180 degree change of its long-held view that it lacksauthority to regulate cigarettes, FDA claims that "recently disclosedindustry documents" contain information on nicotine "not known to FDA at the time of its earlier determinations about theintended use of tobacco."23  Among other information from "industry documents," FDA sets forth a scatter shot of selective quotes from B&amp;W and BATCo. documents.  The resultis an unfaircharacterization of the research, largely deprived of context and meaning.  Inparticular, FDA paints much of the industry nicotine and smoking behaviorresearch as "recently disclosed" when it has in fact been known to the governmentor mirrored in published scientific literature for years.  Beyond its mischaracterization of old information as new, FDA is inaccurate in numerous respects.  Some of the more egregious examples are discussed here.<p><B>A. BATCo.'s Research Into the Properties of Nicotine is Distorted by FDA</B><p>The FDA makes much of the tobacco industry's early researchi ntonicotine, asserting: "It is important to understand why the tobacco industry has conducted this research."24 This latter point is undebatable.  Unfortunately,FDA either does not understand or deliberately distorts the purpose of theresearch it discusses.<p> Widely published research outside of the tobacco industry and available in the 1950s and early 1960s explored the effects of nicotine and the role itplayed in smoking.25  BATCo. also conducted research in this area, but reached no conclusion about nicotine's alleged "addictive potential and properties"26which differed from that which was generally known at that time in thescientific community. FDA is plainly wrong when it claims that "tobaccocompany researchers have known for several decades...that nicotine's drug effects are the central reason that onsumers use tobacco."27  BATCo. research  generally has concluded that the presence and effects of nicotine do notalone account for smoking enjoyment.<p><B>1. BATCo.'s Project Ariel Was an Attempt in the Early 1960s to Producea No-"Tar" Cigarette in Response to a Cigarette Market Concerned About Smoking and Health</B><p>In the early 1960s, Sir Charles Ellis, a physicist,proposed a projectwhich became known as Ariel as a means of replicating the smoking experiencewithout "tar." Epidemiological studies in the 1950s like those by Wynder andDoll had suggested a link between cigarette "tar" and ill-health.28  Inresponse, Sir Charles theorized that smokers might be satisfied with a productproviding nicotine but not "tar", and sought to design an alternative productthat provided only a nicotine aerosol.<p>In addition, as a result of Sir Charles' proposal, BATCo.contracted with Battelle Memorial Institute, an independent scientific laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, to carry outresearch in support of the Ariel project byincreasing BATCo.'s understanding of nicotine.  The Battelle research was called Project HIPPO.  A nicotine absorption study,"The Fate of Nicotine in the Body," was also conducted by Battelle.  Sir Charles also believed that theBattelle research might identify scientifically the beneficial properties ofnicotine.29<P>HIPPO failed to support the tentative hypotheses putforward byBattelle. HIPPO attempted to demonstrate thatnicotine produces some of itseffect on the body by causing certain glands to release hormones whichpresumably affected specific bodily functions. HIPPO failed to show that any ofthe hypothesized mechanisms of action were valid.<p>Ariel was never commercialized. Test smokers found prototype Arielproducts harsh and irritating. The Ariel product was patented, however, makingits technology and concept publicly available information in the 1960s.BATCo. dropped Ariel and never developed it into a marketable product.<p>The early work on Poject Ariel confirms what later studies haveconsistently shown: the enjoyment of smoking is a complex, multifactedphenomenon, which nicotine alone does not and cannot explain. Cigarettes todaythus retain the same basic form as they have for over one hindred years. Smokersdo not want nicotine delivery systems, they want cigarettes.<p><B>2. BATCo.-sponsored Research in the 1960s Was Comparable   to WorkPursued and Published by Others at the Same Time</B><p>The result of Batelle contract research on nicotine were consistentwith work pursued and published elsewhere at the time. /30 As early as 1945, for example, Finnegan observed that nicotine alone cannot explain people'ssmoking behavior. /31 Battele's nicotine pharmacology research was alsocomparable to work being done elsewhere in the 1960s. Just as Project HIPPOsought to evaluate the benefits ofnicotine scientifically, The TobaccoManufacturers' Standing Committee (TMSC) in the U.K., for example, was planiingto study nicotine benefits at the same time. As early as 1959, the TMSC publiclyresolved to study both the psychology of smokers (their personalities and hablits) and why they smoked (the benefits they derived from smoking), hoping todescribe in objective scientific terms the benefits ofsmoking in the midst ofthe ongoing smoking and health controversy.  The TMSC disclosed these objectivesin its published annual report. /32<p>By 1963, the TMSC - by then renamed the Tobacco Research Council (TRC)- publicly detailed its program for "research into pharmacological effects ofsmoking which would provide information on this subject that was validand authoritative." /33  The TRC planned to study nicotine pharmacology both atits Harrogate laboratory and through grants to oustide researchers.  Research atHarrogate would study central nervous system effects of nicotineand nicotine-free basic fractions of smoke condensate to test whether othersubstances in smoke were active; whether nicotine released adrenaline and or adrenaline; nicotineinjections in animals to test effects onblood-brainbarrier permeability; measurements of nicotine levels insmoke,; andpharmacology of nicotine transformation products. /34<p>The TRC published three reviews of its research covering the period1963-1974.  The TRC's reports summarized ongoing research and published resultsobtained in the pharmacology and psychology experiments at Harrogate or by itsgrantees. The TRC ultimately sponsored nicotine research in the U.K.at theUniversity of London, the London School of Pharmacy, Edinburgh University,Chelsea College, Cambridge University, Birmingham University, TavistockInstitute, the Hammersmith Royal Medical School, and Newcastle University. Thisnicotine pharmacology research was descirbed publicyin TRC research reviews.Most TRC-sponsored work was also published separately in the scientificliterature of the time.<p>Nicotine pharmacology research of the 1960s was also discussed publiclyin the 1964 Surgeon General's Report. After reviewing published studies onnicotine pharmacology not only from the 1950s and 1960s, but from as far backas 1905, the Report noted that "the pharmacological effects of nicotine at dosagelevels absorbed from smoking (1-2 mg per inhaled cigarette) are comparativelysmall." /35  The Surgeon General further noted that "nicotine inquantities absored from smoking and other methods of tobacco use is very low andprobably does not represent a significant health problem." /36  A review ofLarson's classic text on tobacco from 1961 also shows that extensivenicotine pharmacology research had been published by that time. /37<p><B>3. FDA Misuses Statements in BATCo. Documents About "Addiction"</B><p>FDA quotes Sir Charles Ellis as having acknowledged in the early 1960sthat people smoke because they are "addicted" to nicotine. /38  FDA ignores thehistorical context in which Sir Charles Ellis was speaking.  In fact,Sir Charles' terminology mirrored virtually identical phrases used by the RoyalCollege of Physicians three months earlier in their landmark report <I> Smoking andHealth</I>.  The fact that he picked up a phrase from a recently issued governmentreport does not support any conclusion about his own views, let alone the viewsof B&amp;W or BATCo.  FDA improperly quotes a portion of one sentence in theEllis document as if it were a full sentence.  The full document is a speech inwhich Sir Charles was describing to the BATCo. research conferees his reactionto the RCP report. In the speech, Sir Charles stated:<p><blockquote>After reading the Report of the Royal College of Physicians and thedebate in the House of Lords the dominant impression I received was that ofpeople who had reached an emotional conclusion in which they believedpassionately and sincerely.<p>...<P>Emotional judgments are often the basis of national thinking, and sincea national attitude to smoking may be building up, it is essential for us toconsider what are the components in this emotion.<p>...<P>Lastly, smoking is a habit of addiction that is pleasurable; manypeople, therefore, find themselves sub-consciously prepared to believe that itmust be wrong. /39<p> </blockquote>The Royal College uses similarly imprecise language:<p><blockquote>There are "[w]ide spread popular beliefs (which doctors mostlyshare..that it is, or at any rate can become, an addictive habit." /40<p>...<P>The discomforts that ensue when smoking is stopped may thus be genuinewithdrawal symptoms due to addiction to nicotine, but are also those to beexpected when any well-established and pleasant habit isdiscontinued, particularly one which has become a valued element in  everyday lifeand is regarded as a prop or solace. /41<p></blockquote>The Royal College did not conclude that smoking is "addictive" in thesense FDA uses that term today.  To thecontrary, the Royal College reportedthat, between 1951 and 1961, the approximate percentage of doctors who didnot smoke increased by 39%, while the approximate percentage of doctors whosmoked declined by 33%. /42<p>Most important, in 1964 the U.S. Surgeon General carefully andextensively analyzed the question whether smoking was better characterized as a"habit" or an "addiction" and concluded based upon science that the term "habit"was more appropriate.  This careful conclusion clearly trumps the earlierimprecise language quoted by FDA.<p>FDA also dwells on a three page letter from Battelle scientistsentitled "A Tentative Hypothesis on Nicotine Addiction." /43  This is not as FDAasserts a report written by "Tobacco Company Researchers." /44  The "TentativeHypothesis" is not research, it is not a BATCo. hypothesis, it is not evenBattelle contract work.<p>The "Tentative Hypothesis" document reports no research or data.  The"addiction" hypothesis it discusses has never been substantiated.  Indeed, atthe very  same time that "Tentative Hypothesis" was written, one of thesame scientists made a different observation in a study of nicotine absorptionand distribution he did conduct at Battelle called "The Fate of Nicotine in theBody:"<p> <blockquote>In any case, the present results offer no conclusive evidence for anyparticular mechanism involved in tolerance to nicotine, nor do they indicate alead to the phenomenon of addiction. /45<p></blockquote>The "Tentative Hypothesis" is nothing more than speculation.  FDA's useof it is a further example of FDA's manipulation and mischaracterization of bitsof information to fit its own pre-ordained conclusion.<p><blockquote><B>B. B&amp;W and BATCo. Research into "Low 'Tar," Medium Nicotine"Cigarettes, Undertaken Largely in Response to Government Initiatives, Revealedthat Consumers Did Not Want Such Cigarettes.</B><p></blockquote>As set forth in the industry's "Comments on Scientific and Manufacturing Issues," when demand for lower "tar" delivery products grew,government policy beginning in the 1970s encouraged the development andmanufacture of a "low-'tar,'medium-nicotine" cigarette./46 Although thetobacco companies did not claim that lower "tar" delivery products were "safer,"scientists and the government published concerns that smokers switching to lower"tar" delivery cigarettes might change their smoking patterns if nicotine levelswere too low, effectively counteracting any anticipated benefits from lower"tar" delivery products.<p>In the U.S., the government encouraged an effort to develop cigaretteswhich were lower in "tar," but delivered a higher level of nicotine than mightbe expected given the "tar" reduction -- i.e., a low "tar"/nicotine (orhigh nicotine/"tar") ratio. Dr. Gio Gori of the National Cancer Institute, forexample, suggested investigating a low "tar"/nicotine ration, low "tar"cigarette./47 The Surgeon General also suggested that a low "tar"/nicotineration might be a desirable strategy for lower risk cigarettes./48<p>The push for a relatively higher nicotine level in low "tar" deliverycigarettes was particularly strong in the U.K., urged on by thegovernment-appointed Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health(ISCSH). Its report noted that "there should be available to the public somebrands with tar yields below those of the present principal Low Tar brands . . .but with proportionately higher nicotine yields."/49 The ISCSH's FourthReport, issued in 1988, also expressly stated that for product development, "theoverall aim should be towards reductions in the tar/nicotine ratio."/50 TheISCSH proposed continuing to follow its earlier suggestion that there should besome brands "available to the public with nicotine yields below 1 mg and withtar yields reduced to a proportionately greater extent."/51<p>In response, BATCo. investigated a variety of techniques to decrease"tar"/nicotine ratios in low "tar" cigarettes and studied the role of nicotinein smoking./52 BATCo's research found that smokers do not want cigaretteswith unusually high nicotine levels or with unusually low"tar"/nicotine ratios,because they are sensorially unbalanced. As a result, despite BATCo.'sinvestigations in this area, corresponding product modifications werenever commercialized.<p><B>1.  Y-1 Tobacco Was Never Employed to Increase Nicotine in B&amp;W Cigarettes</B><p>FDA attacks B&amp;W for allegedly "admitting" that Y-1, a high nicotinetobacco, was intended as a "blending tool" to enable the company to designproducts that were lower in nicotine./53 Y-1 was initially developed by agovernment researcher, Dr. James R. Chaplin, in the 1970s expressly as part ofthe larger government inspired effort to develop a low "tar," medium nicotinecigarette. B&amp;W later took over development and refinement of Chaplin's workand filed patent appllications in the U.S. and Brazil for Y-1 in 1991 and 1992,respectively. U.S. Patent App. No. 761,312 (Sept.17, 1991) (cited by the FDA at60 Fed. Reg. 41701 n. 411) was abandoned by B&amp;W in March 1994. B&amp;W neverdeveloped a commercial cigarette which used Y-1 to lower the ratioof "tar"/nicotine, largely because consumer panels rejected the prototypes.<p>FDA wrongly implies that B&amp;W in fact used Y-1 to maintain orincrease nicotine levels in marketed cigarettes bystating without explanationthat Y-1 was "used commercially" in certain B&amp;W brands./54  FDA'simplicationis both false and unfair. Y-1 was never used by B&amp;W forthe purpose of altering the ration of nicotine to "tar" in the smoke of anycommerciallized brands. In fact, to the limited extent of its commercial use,Y-1 did not and does not alter in any significant way the nicotine and"tar" deliveries of the same brands made without Y-1. Therefore, FDA's assertionthat "tobacco could be bred to increase nicotine levels." /55 is irrelevant tothe actual purpose for which Y-1 has been used in B&amp;W cigarettes.<p><B>2. The Barclay Cigarette Was Not Designed To "Boost" Nicotine Delivery</B><p>FDA asserts that B&amp;W employed a channel-ventilated filter design inBarclay cigarettes with a view to aiding smoker compensatioin and "to boostnicotine delivery . . . ." /56FDA does not cite a single B&amp;W document tosupport this erroneous claim. The channel-ventilated filter was not intended toboost nicotine delivery. To the contrary, it represented a new type ofventilated filter design, which like most other ventilation designs,substantially reduced "tar" and consequently nicotine deliveries comparedto historic deliveries of full flavor cigarettes.<p>B&amp;W began research in the 1970s to improve the taste of low tarcigarettes. The channel-ventilated filter was part of that effort. Conventionalventilated filters use minute holes which perforate the filter wrap and enterthe filter, permitting air to mix with and dilute the smoke. B&amp;W developed anew product which incorporated a channel-ventilated filter design called theActron filter. The Actron filter was introduced in Barclay cigarettes in 1981 andprovided substantial improvement in smoke taste and flavor over competing low"tar" cigarettes using conventional ventilation holes.<p>B&amp;W had concluded that the Actron filter's four channels runningalong the filter just beneath the filter wrap would keep the air and smoke flowsseparate until each reached the smoker's mouth. B&amp;W believed that thechannels would then cause turbulence and a noticeable swirling effect in themouth which would enhance the sensory properties of the smoke.<p>In mischaracterizing Barclay's Actron filter as a "nicotine booster,"FDA relies only on the FTC proceedings against the Barclay advertising claimthat it delivered "1 mg." of "tar." This dispute is well documented in reportedcasescited by FDA. 60 Fed. Reg. 417179 n. 470 (FTC v. Brown &amp;Williamson Tobacco Corp., 580 F. Supp. 981 (D.D.C. 1983), aff'd in part, remanded in part,778 F.2d 35 (D.C. Cir.1985)).<p>The FTD declared on June 25, 1982 that its machine testing method formeasuring smoke deliveries did not measure channel-ventilated ciagrettes in acomparable manner to conventional filtered cigarettes, particularly becauseof its concern that in actual (rather than machine) smoking a smoker's lips couldblock the channel vents and decrease the air flow. FTC News Release (June 25,1982)(App. Tab14). Barclay was then removed from the FTC machinetesting program. B&amp;W continued to claim a 1 mg. "tar" delivery based on itsown, internal machine testing. The FTC further concluded B&amp;W should drop theclaim because consumers mighterroneously believe the measurement wassubstantiated by the FTC method. The court affirmed that conclusion. Brown&amp;Williamson, 580 F. Supp. at 987. FDA fails to acknowledge, however, that thecourt also found B&amp;W's claim that Barclay was "99% tar free" was notmisleading: "Even the FTC's own consumer survey suggests that the overwhelmingmajority of consumers perceive '99% tar free' as a general low tar claim.<p>Contrary to the FDA's incomplete discussion, the courts and the FTCnever found that B&amp;W employed the Actron filter to "boost nicotine"deliveries. B&amp;W had argued that Barclay was accurately labelled a 1 mg."tar" cigarette by its own scientifically valid testing method and the FTC andB&amp;W's competitors (principally RJR and Philip Morris) asserted that 3-7 mgs.was a more appropriate claim pursuant to other testing methods. The courtconcluded that regardless of the precise tar delivery in dispute, any of"[t]hese estimates would still place Barclay in the ultra low tar range ofcigarettes." Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp v.FTC, 778 F.2d 35, 38 (D.C.Cir1985). In sum, as the court and the FTC recognized, the issue regardingBarclay was correct measurement of "tar" and nicotine delivery, not some latent"boosting" of nicotine.<p> Despite the enormous public record detailing over 5 years ofadministrative and court proceedings, FDA makes the completely unsubstantiatedclaim that the Actron filter "represents an attempt [by B&amp;W] to avoid someof the reduction in nicotine that can accompany the use ofventilated conventional filters." 60 Fed. Reg. 41718. Unsurprisingly FDA hasnothing to back up this unsupportable claim.<p><B>3. FDA's Contentions Regarding B&amp;W's Use of Ammonia Compounds AreErroneous and Misleading</B><p>FDA contends that cigarette maufacturers add chemicals to tobacco "toenhance the efficient extraction by the smoker of nicotine fron tobacco in therod." /57 FDA speculates that ammonia compounds added in tobacco by B&amp;W andother manufacturers increase the rate at which nicotine is absorbed into thebloodstream, thus allegedly enhancing the effect of nicotine on the centralnervous system. /58 As demonstrated in th Joint Industry Response, FDA'sspeculation is contradicted by the very evidence it relies upon.59 B&amp;Wadopts and incorporates those comments herein, and provides these additional comments.<p><B>(a) The Role of Ammonia Compounds in Cigarette Manufacturing</B><p>Ammonia compounds were first used in cigarette manufacturing in the1950's as a processing aid in making bandcast reconstituted tobacco. In thatprocess, ammonia compounds act to release pectinsin the stems, broken leaves,and fine particles of tobacco dust that make up the reconstituted tobacco sheetfrom their naturally occurring form to a form which is available to hold thesheet together.<p>The addition of ammonia compounds also facilitates the development offlavor. B&amp;W is not completely certain of the mechanism by which this occurs.However, B&amp;W's understanding is that ammonia reacts with naturally occurringsugars in foods and tobacco to form a class of flavorful materials which has acharacteristic roasted or toasted flavor. This reaction, known as the Maillardreaction, has been the subject of investigation in the food scienceliterature for decades.60 Proteins in tobacco break down into amino acids thatare capable of releasing ammonia during the curing process, resulting in theformation of volatile flavors and flavor precursors. This reaction occursnaturally in foods during cooking and in tobacco during curing and aging.<p> As an example, raw dough has very little to no aroma. However, whenbread is baked, the entire house is filled with a pleasant aroma. This aroma isa result of the Maillard reaction. Ammonia compounds are added as leavening tobaked products to facilitate yeast reactions. In fact, ammonia compounds areused in hundreds of food products. A walk down the aisles of any supermarketwill reveal that ammonia compounds are a standard additive in suchproducts asWonder Bread, Stouffer's French Bread Pizzas, Chef Boyardee ABC's &amp; 123'sPasta, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, Weight Watchers Smart Snackers cookies, Ghirardelli's Cookies and Creme, and Budget Gourmet dinners, among manyothers. B&amp;W researchers found that cigarettes containing small amountsof ammonia develop compounds similar to those in burley tobacco, giving a greaterburley-type flavor when smoked. This led them to conclude that the interactionof ammonia and sugar improves theflavor of tobacco smoke. The ammonia compoundsadded to B&amp;W products simply enhance processes that occur naturally duringthe aging process and when tobacco is smoked. Ammonia is also believed to be anameliorant, reducing the harshness and irritation of cigarette smoke.<p><B>(b) Ammonia and "Impact"</B><p>While ignoring the role of ammonia compounds in improving flavor and reducing irritation and harshness, FDA focuses on a suggestion  in a stolen,confidential B&amp;W document identifying ammonia as an "impact booster:"<p>Ammonia, when added to a tobacco blend, reacts with the indigenousnicotine salts and liberates free nicotine. As aresult of such change, theratio of extractable nicotine to bound nicotine in the smoke may be altered infavor of extractable nicotine. As we know, extractable nicotine contributesto impact in cigarette smoke and that is how ammonia can act  as an impactbooster.61<p>As FDA itself acknowledges, B&amp;W defines "impact" as "the hit or punch in the back of the throat when [a smoker] first  inhale[s]."62 Asdiscussed in Section I above, "impact" is an immediate response, less than onesecond in duration. Further,"impact" is a subjective response. Correlating sucha subjective impression with specific aspects of the chemistry of cigarette smokeis, at  best, an uncertain undertaking.<p>FDA asserts that "[a]mmonia increases the pH of smoke andthereby  enhances the absorption of nicotine by the body.63 FDA is wrong. First,as stated in Volume IV of the Joint Industry Response, Section F, the level ofammonia used in commercially marketed  cigarettes is too low to cause anysignificant formation of  extractable nicotine. Second, formation of extractablenicotine is  wholly irrelevant to the absorption of nicotine into the  bloodstream.As also demonstrated in the Joint Industry Response, researchers on both sidesof the debate have concluded that the nicotine in cigarette smoke is absorbedefficiently by the smoker,regardless of its form or pH level.64 BATCo.documents cited by FDA demonstrate that B&amp;W and BATCo. researchers knew thisfact.65<p>In sum, FDA's conclusions regarding cigarette manufacturers' use ofammonia in the manufacture of their products find no support either in thedocuments relied upon by FDA or in established scientific principles. Thearbitrary and capricious nature of FDA's claims on this issue is fully revealedby its contradictory statements, noted in the Joint Industry Response, thatcigarette manufacturers simultaneously add ammonia to increase pH and add sugarsto decrease pH, both with the intent to increase the absorption of nicotine bysmokers. Such inconsistent and erroneous conclusions demonstrate FDA's completelack of understanding or  deliberate distortion of information concerning the useof ammonia  by Brown &amp; Williamson.<p><blockquote><B>C. BATCo.'s Knowledge Regarding Smoker Compensation Was No Different ofBetter Than That Which Was Widely Known Elsewhere</B><p></blockquote>FDA also cites BATCo. studies purportedly regarding "compensation"--the widely acknowledged potential for some smokers to vary the way in which theysmoke in order to increase or decrease the levels of tar and nicotine theyobtain from lower-delivery products.66 FDA's discussion is significantlymisleading in a number of respects.<p><B>1. Compensation</B><p>First, FDA asserts that the phenomenon of compensation was internally"recognized" or "acknowledged" by tobacco manufacturers.67 This is hardly news.Compensation has been known and studied by the scientific community (includingtobacco company researchers) and the government for decades.68<p>Second, FDA wrongly claims that BATCo. researchers "recognized"or "acknowledged" that compensation is employed by smokers to obtain a dose ofnicotine required to satisfy their "physiological need."69 In fact, some of thecited studies have nothing to do with compensation. For example, the citedBATCo. report on "The Effect of Puff Volume on 'Extractable Nicotine' and onthe Retention of Nicotine in the Mouth" makes no observations regarding alleged"physiological need" for nicotine, or regarding compensation for that matter.70Others reach conclusions at odds with the proposition for which FDA cites them.For example, one  cited article concluded that a series of butt analysisexperiments demonstrated varying degrees of incomplete compensation,71Yet another cited document in fact concluded that "compensation" occurs todecrease intake of nicotine, rather than increase it.72<p>Third, FDA wrongly asserts that compensation is used by smokersto obtain specific doses of nicotine. This claim is fully addressed in the JointIndustry Response. Finally, notwithstanding FDA'sstrained and frequently unfairreferences to BATCo. studies, it is  most telling that FDA cannot assert that thehistoric reduction in "tar" and nicotine deliveries by B&amp;W cigarettes hasachieved anything other than a reduction in the amounts of nicotine obtained bysmokers.<p><B>2. Elasticity</B><p>The FDA alleges that manufacturers have attempted to assistsmokers tocompensate for nicotine by making cigarettes more"elastic."73 FDA seeks tosupport its contentions by selectivelyquoting from notes of BATCo. marketingand research meetings inthe 1970s and 1980s,74 including a brainstormingsession calledthe "Structured Creativity Conference."75<p>These theoretical discussions reflect the fact that BATCo. explored thepossibility of using its knowledge of compensation in the development of low"tar" products. BATCo. and B&amp;W, however, have never marketed a product whichhas used elasticity to enable smokers to compensate for nicotine.  Thesetheoretical discussions upon which FDA relies bear no relationship to the actualproducts B&amp;W has marketed in the United States.<p>FDA erroneously concludes that "the documental reveal the  industry'sconcern with the trend toward the lower-tar products, and the industry's intensepreoccupation with the need to provide adequate nicotine deliveriesdespite lowered tar deliveries." /76  This "concern" is more accurately describedas a concern with understanding customer acceptance of low "tar" deliverycigarettes generally.  If smokers rejected low "tar" delivery products, theymight abandon them for more traditional higher delivery brands.  The governmentand independent scientific researchers publicly expressed this identical concernin the 1970s: How can smokers be encouraged to switch to lower delivery productsand stay there? /77 BATCo. and B&amp;W, like other manufacturers,naturally responded by exploring many ways in which to maintain taste and flavorin low "tar" delivery products.  In reality, however, the manufacturers andscientists learned that smokers' tendencies to compensate upward after switchingto lower delivery products waned over time and that they adjusted to the taste oflower "tar" deliveries. /78  The concern that, in general, smokers might rejectlower "tar" delivery products also waned.<p><blockquote><B>D. BATCo. Also Researched the Role of Nicotine in Smoking Behavior inan Attempt to Understand How to Design Acceptable Low "Tar" Delivery Products</B><p></blockquote>In the 1970s, BATCo. began research into motivations for smoking (whydo people keep smoking?) that was thought tobe of possible assistance indesigning cigarettes for consumer acceptance in a market increasingly dominatedby demand for lower "tar" delivery products and government endorsement of lower"tar" delivery cigarettes.  Just as in the published literature, BATCo.scientists observed that nicotine played a role in smokers' motivations tosmoke, but it was clearly not the sole reason for smoking.  None of BATCo.'sresearch was aimed at maintaining or enhancing nicotine levels to "addict"smokers.<p>One of BATCo.'s studies into smoking motivation inparticular, ProjectWheat, has been wholly mischaracterized in the FDA report.  Project Wheat wasbased on work done by Dr. A.C. McKennell for the British Ministry of Health.In1970, McKennell published "Smoking Motivation Factors," in the British Journalof Social Clinical Psychology. /79  Dr. McKennell tried to determine when peoplesmoked, in the hope of identifying the "needs" individual smokers believed theywere satisfying.  Dr. McKennell broadly categorized  smokers' motivations into"inner needs" and "social factors."  He then described subcategories of"inner needs," corresponding to five nonsocially-motivated times for smoking: (1)nervous irritation; (2) relaxation smoking; (3) smoking alone; (4) activity accompaniment; and (5) food substitution.  Thus, these terms originated from Dr.McKennell, not BATCo.<p>BATCo. saw McKennell's study as a potential opportunity to segmentconsumers according to their motivations to smoke,and then to design differentcigarettes to meet their different demands.  Part of Project Wheat wasconcerned with the question of whether McKennell's "inner needs" correlated withnicotine deliveries.  FDA, however, wrongly and with no basis concludes that "asmoker's Inner Need was "defined by the extent to which the smokerused cigarettes for the drug effects of nicotine." /80  Project Wheat nowheredrew this conclusion.  Indeed, Project Wheat failed to find any significantcorrelation between nicotine levels and Dr. McKennell's "inner need"subcategories of smokers.  It is false to suggest that Project Wheatidentifiedan allegedly "addictive" dose of nicotine.  To the contrary, Project Wheatconcluded - as Finnegan had 30 years earlier - that nicotine alone does notexplain smoking motivation. /81  Furthermore, BATCo. and B&amp;W have neverimplemented any particular cigarette design as the result of Project Wheat.<p><blockquote><B>E. B&amp;W and BATCo. Have Never Determined That Smokers Cannot QuitSmoking</B><p></blockquote>The industry response demonstrates that - regardless of time period -under scientifically verifiable criteria,neither cigarette smoking nor thenicotine in smoke is addictive.  People can and do quit smoking.  No BATCo.or B&amp;W research has ever determined to the contrary.  None of B&amp;W's orBATCo.'s efforts was aimed at, or resulted in, control of smokers' ability toquit smoking.  B&amp;W and BATCo. never concluded that nicotine precludessmokers from quitting.  B&amp;W and BATCo. never researched nicotineto manipulate levels in cigarettes to "addict" smokers.  And nicotine does notforeclose consumer choice. /82<p>The FDA makes much of early quotes in which certain B&amp;W or BATCo.employees use the term "addictive" in reference tosmoking, or call nicotine a"drug."  As demonstrated in these comments, however, phrases FDA selectivelyculls from B&amp;W and BATCo. documents, read in context, are nothing more thanlanguage picked up from government and other external sources.  They cannot beattributed to B&amp;W or BATCo.<p>In addition, semantic gamesmanship and phrases taken out of historicalcontext do not and cannot change the basic facts that:<p><UL><LI>The enjoyment of smoking is a complex, multifaceted experience whichnicotine alone does not explain;<p><LI>Studies containing information comparable to and consistent with theresearch on nicotine and smoking in "recently disclosed" BATCo. and B&amp;Wdocuments have been publicly available in the lay and scientific pressfor decades; <p><LI>People have always known that smoking can be difficult to quit; yet<p><LI>An estimated 46 million people have quit smoking in the United States.  <p></ul><a name=con><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></a>As shown in these Comments and the Joint Industry Comments, FDA's"Findings" concerning "Statements, Research, and Actions By Tobacco Companies"are inaccurate and disingenuous as applied to B&amp;W and to the industry asa whole.  FDA's basic premise that B&amp;W and other cigarette manufacturers"manipulate" nicotine levels to create and maintain "addiction" is simply false.Therefore, FDA's "Findings" cannot provide a basis for FDA to decidethat nicotine is a "drug" and to regulate cigarettes as "devices" even if FDA hadthe power to make those decisions, which it does not.<p><UL>Respectfully submitted,<p><B>BROWN &amp; WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION</B><p>By Scott Appleton, Ph.D.Director of Scientific and Regulatory<br>Affairs 2600 Weaver Road Macon, Georgia31298<p>Of Counsel: Andrew S.

FDA also relies on a handful of marketing studies forImperialTobacco, Ltd., a BATCO and B&amp;W affiliate, to suggest that manufacturershave closely studied quitting behavior, and to imply that any difficulty inquitting is somehow related to nicotine. 60 Fed. Reg. 41670-72.  Read incontext, however, those studies, done by independent market research firms andaddressing a variety of issues, present only anecdotal evidence of quittingbehavior.  Even the evidence presented, however, demonstrates that the reasonsfor smoking are a complex mix of factors.  In fact, as concluded by one of thestudies cited by FDA, environmental and social factors, not any physiologicaleffects, are the primary reason for failed attempts to quit.

Looking for a quick lead on a case cite?  Want to see if anyone knows where to find an expert witness in a particular area?  Interested in debating a new decision in your practice area?  Visit one of Counsel Connect's discussion groups and you'll find colleagues ready to help out -- or join in the discussion.<P>

Each of our 200 discussion groups covers a different topic, and most are moderated by well known-experts in that area.  Whether you're interested in securities law, medical malpractice or law practice management, there's a discussion group where you can connect with other lawyers to get the information you need.  And Counsel Connect's legal editors post copies of new cases and other useful information in those discussion groups so that participants have quick access to relevant materials.  Discussion groups are easy on your schedule: post a comment in the morning (or anytime you want) and come back when it's convenient to read the responses.

<p>

<font color="ff1111" font size=3>Discussion Groups.</font>  Whether you need a quick case cite, the name of a relevant legal treatise, feedback on time and billing software packages or the name of a good expert witness, you will find Counsel Connect members who can help.  Rather than spending your scarce time tracking down the information you need, just take a minute and post a quick note in one of our 200 discussion groups.  Then check back later that day (or that week) to see who has responded.<p>

<font color="ff1111" font size=3>Legal Products and Services.</font>  Every day you are faced with an increasing number of choices about which products and services to use for your law practice.  Counsel Connect's Resources menu contains information about a wide variety of legal products and services that will help you to make informed choices.  Better yet, the companies selling these products and services are available by e-mail, allowing you to contact them with your questions easily.<p>

<font color="ff1111" font size=3>Communication.</font>  Counsel Connect's e-mail and private conferencing features can help you cut down -- or even eliminate -- fax and overnight charges.  Instead of sending out a document by fax or courier, you can send that same document by e-mail -- saving you time and money.  If you are working with a group of attorneys, you can make documents available to co-counsel by setting up a secure private room -- thereby cutting down on the inevitable calls asking for copies of different documents.<p>

<font color="ff1111" font size=3>Internet.</font>  There is a huge amount of valuable legal information on the Internet -- information that other companies normally charge a lot of money to provide.  Counsel Connect's Internet connection allows you to get those materials at a fraction of what they ordinarily cost.  And our free Lawlinks service puts those materials at your fingertips.<p>

Of course, these are just a few examples of how Counsel Connect can help you manage your practice more effectively -- your Counsel Connect membership includes free training, and our customer service staff will be happy to explore all of the ways that Counsel Connect can benefit your practice.<P>

<font color="000000" font size=5><center>Build Your Practice -- Online.<BR> </CENTER></FONT><P>

When you join Counsel Connect, a whole world of opportunities to meet new clients and develop new business relationships will open up for you.  Here's how:<P>

<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3>Discussion Groups</FONT></B><BR>

Participating in Counsel Connect's discussion groups is one of the most effective ways to develop professional relationships that lead to new opportunities.  When you join in online dicussions -- whether to debate a recent decision or help out another member with a tip or a case cite -- you'll get to know colleagues just as you do in person.  And when your online colleagues need to retain a lawyer with your experience, you'll be the person they contact.<P>

<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3> Lawyer Inquiries</FONT></B><BR>

Every day Counsel Connect members post notices in our Inquiries areas looking for counsel with particular expertise.  Whether they need advice on California tax law or a lawyer with medical malpractice experience in Boston, our members have discovered that Counsel Connect is the fastest way to find lawyers with the right experience.  And if you're that lawyer, checking out Counsel Connect's Inquiries areas regularly will pay off for your practice.<P>


<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3>Online Publishing </FONT></B><BR>

As a Counsel Connect member, you can get the word out about your area of expertise by publishing your articles or other written documents online.  Just e-mail us the material and we'll load them in our searchable online library, where other members interested in those topics can find it -- and you.<P>


<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3>New Business Panels</FONT></B><BR>

Counsel Connect 's "Quick Request for Proposals" service allows in-house counsel and non-lawyer business people to e-mail descriptions of matters for which they need to hire counsel to panels of Counsel Connect members experienced in that area.  Interested panel members can contact the sender with their qualifications and a description of how they would handle the matter and on what terms.<P>

<font color="ff1111" font size=5><center>Communications</CENTER></FONT></P>

<B><font color="000000" font size=3></FONT></B><BR>

Counsel Connect's communication features -- our unique private conferencing service and comprehensive e-mail system -- will help make your law practice more efficient and allow you to spend less time on administrative activities (not to mention less money on overnight and fax charges):<p>

<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3>PRIVATE CONFERENCING</FONT></B><BR>

Counsel Connect's "Private" feature allows you to create your own online "conference rooms" where you can store documents, share information and hold discussions with other lawyers.  It takes only a minute or two to setup a private room and, once created, a private room remains online as long as you want.  Private rooms are secure, and no one but you and the Counsel Connect members you select have access to the private rooms you create.</P>

<P>
Private rooms can help save you time and money in a variety of situations.  Here are just two examples:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><font color="ff1111" font size=3>Ongoing matters:</FONT>  You and co-counsel can set up a private room to store and exchange materials (such as depositions, drafts, etc.).  Instead of faxing documents (or sending them by overnight mail) to everyone, you can store them in the private room, thereby making them available to co-counsel instantly -- and at a fraction of the cost.</BR><BR>
<font color="ff1111" font size=3>Bar association work:</FONT>  You and other members of the bar committees you serve on can create private rooms where you can hold online discussions and work on bar matters.</BLOCKQUOTE></BR>

<P>There is no charge for creating private rooms, and you may create as many as you wish.</P>


<P>
<B><font color="ff1111" font size=3>E-MAIL</FONT></B><BR>

Counsel Connect's e-mail system is easy to use and allows you to connect with virtually anyone on the information highway.  Our document attachment feature allows you to send documents (a draft of a brief, a contract or anything stored on your computer) by e-mail with a click of your mouse.  That means no more waiting for overnight mail or sending expensive faxes.  Also, Counsel Connect uses state of the art security, so you can rest assured that your communications are secure.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Counsel Connect restricts membership to practicing lawyers and their professional staff, working under the supervision of a lawyer-member, so that all members are assured that discussion participants have a basic level of expertise and have knowingly agreed to the rules that govern the discussions.<P>

This allows Counsel Connect to create a focused and like-minded community and provide a high level of discussion already filtered of the usual Internet noise.<P>

<FONT COLOR="42426F"> <H2>PROTECTING TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMATION:<BR>

HOW SAFE IS YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET?</H2></FONT>



<H3>January 15 - February 4, 1997</H3>



<P>CLE CREDIT AVAILABLE  -- REGISTRATION REQUIRED</P>





<P>Your company is a reservoir of confidential information.  Is it

adequately protecting its valuable business secrets?  Preventing

intrusions into paper and computer files?  Averting the use or

disclosure of proprietary information when an employee moves to a

competitor?    On the flip side, how is your company avoiding the

risk of using someone else’s trade secrets when new employees come

aboard?  </P>

<P>

Join this seminar to get the information and tools you need to

safeguard your company's files and maintain their confidentiality.

From a panel of experts drawn from law firms, corporations, law

schools and the government, you’ll learn how to:

<UL>

<LI> Define a trade secret and determine whether one exists

 

<LI> Draft non-compete and confidentiality agreements that prevent

employees from walking away with and using your crucial information

 

<LI>Understand the in-house view of trade secrets



<LI> Maintain information security

 

<LI> Understand the limits on restricting access to and use of

confidential information

 

<LI> Litigate a trade secrets case: the key strategies and tactics

 

<LI> Frame protective orders and injunctions



<LI>Deal with the recently-enacted Economic Espionage Act, which

makes the theft of trade secrets a federal crime

</UL>

<P>

Moderated by VICTORIA  A. CUNDIFF of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &

Walker, NY, this program features an outstanding group of panelists

ollowing a Hawaii trial judge's decision allowing same-sex marriages in Baehr v. Miike, Counsel Connect held an instant seminar to discuss the decision's implications. In the following discussion, panelists discuss the possibility of amending the Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. This conversation is reprinted with the respondents' permission.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>A number of people have begun to float an idea that may take hold -- the idea is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to define marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. I haven't seen any draft yet, but it might go something like this:</P>



<P>"Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman. Neither the United States government nor any state or local government shall recognize any other relationship as a marriage or as equivalent to marriage."</P>



<P>In light of the national consensus in support of conventional marriage, this is exactly one of those rare cases in which a constitutional amendment is justified. An activist court in one small state is threatening to throw a monkey wrench into our collective understanding of marriage. A constitutional amendment would trump the Hawaii courts and also instruct the U.S. Supreme Court that the will of the people about the meaning of marriage should prevail. Any thoughts? </P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>Haven't we learned from the failure of Prohibition that the Constitution should not be used as a document to legislate social behavior? I cannot fathom that the federal government's interest in marriage is so strong that it arises to the level of the need for a constitutional amendment and I would fear the consequences of what other social issues might find their way into the Constitution. Abortion? Divorce? Child birth limits on the poor?</P>



<P>Each unpopular cause is fair game.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>I think a constitutional amendment, though clearly the constitutionally proper response to Hawaii's choice to be different, is wrong. I attach no significance to how Hawaii reached its decision; if its people think their court has misconstrued their constitution, their remedy is to amend their constitution. But I see no reason why the rest of us should amend ours. The future of the republic does not turn on whether Hawaii extends legal recognition to same-sex marriages. I would leave it to the good people of Hawaii to govern themselves.</P>

<BR>Date: Mon Dec 9 18:22:36 1996

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>A constitutional amendment defining marriage may not be necessary. Federal statutes supersede state constitutions under the Supremacy Clause. Presumably a federal statute defining marriage would override any decision in Hawaii, unless it were successfully argued that Congress does not have authority to legislate on the subject. (And, if Congress lacks authority to legislate on the subject, then the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) may well be unconstitutional on that ground -- at least the part of DOMA which purports to relieve the federal government from recognizing lawfully contracted same-sex marriages.)</P>



<P>The thing that's interesting about a constitutional amendment, as proposed by Prof. Duncan, is that this is a process that is much easier to stop than legislation. An amendment requires super-majorities from both houses of Congress, followed by ratification in 3/4 of the states. As the battles played out in state legislatures over the past year have indicated, this is not necessarily an issue where ratification would sweep through the states. And since this is a time-consuming process, it is possible that with same-sex marriage becoming a reality in Hawaii, people will notice that the sky is not falling in and that, in fact, the number of same-sex couples who marry in Hawaii will not be extraordinary. (Look at the experience with domestic partnership registration -- even in places where the registration carries substantial benefits, the number registering is actually rather small compared to the eligible population.) So, it is possible that a constitutional amendment, even if it gets the required super-majorities in Congress, could well stall in the states, as the Equal Rights Amendment stalled back in the 1970s.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>I think we are stuck with federalism. This from an 18th-century mind like mine. If one state wants to go its way as a "laboratory" then it should. But of course, the state legislature and the people of Hawaii can trump the state Supreme Court.</P>



<P>Maybe the problem is having a written constitution with judicial review. While I would not lightly give up the U.S. Constitution, I would be willing to completely rewrite my own state constitution -- Texas has a doozy. If the new federalism plays out like Justice Brennan hoped, with fifty state Warren courts, maybe some laboratory will pull the plug on the experiment and take steps to downsize state court judicial review of the state constitution. . . . </P>

<BR>Date: Tue Dec 10 11:00:15 1996

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>Domestic Partner Registration, with which I am not familiar, may be the answer to the following:</P>



<P>1. If a legislature (federal or state) will not conduct an inquiry into how best to recognize (among other measures, give legal protection to) gay relationships, perhaps the courts must;</P>



<P>2. Why aren't we looking for a "third way" to provide gay persons with what they need and are entitled to by way of legal recognition? I don't care who is deemed to have the burden of proof on this issue -- that is, is according gay couples the full panoply of traditional marital rights and responsibilities the only way to accord them equal treatment? -- but some institution should initiate the inquiry.</P>



<P>I feel intuitively that recognizing gay marriages will, in the end, prove to be the right thing to do, but we are dealing here not only with perhaps the most powerful and numinous forces in the history of mankind, but also with an incredibly complicated network of legal, social and religious relationships which no one, to my knowledge, has thought through in light of Hawaii's initiative. To respond to this issue with a locked-in, either/or response seems to me to be very superficial.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>I want to reply to Prof. Leonard's suggestion that Congress has legislative power here. How could Congress constitutionally forbid a state from establishing same-sex marriages? What is the source of its power to legislate? Surely not the Commerce Clause. And whatever the narrow grant of authority in the Full Faith and Credit Clause (FFCC) means, it cannot mean that Congress has the power to intrude into Hawaii's decision to allow same-sex marriages. I do not even think the FFCC gives Congress the power to relieve other states from whatever the FFCC obligates them to do, though I am far from sure that the FFCC requires interstate recognition. But setting aside full faith and credit issues, how could Congress possibly have the legislative power to forbid Hawaii from providing for same-sex marriages?</P>



<P>That said, why must Congress defer to Hawaii in establishing what constitutes a marriage for purposes of federal benefit programs? Here congressional spending power would seem plenary, limited only by guarantees of individual rights. It seems plausible to me that Congress is powerless to interfere with Hawaii's expected decision to allow same-sex marriages, but that Congress is not obligated to recognize same-sex marriages in providing benefits under, say, the Social Security Act unless the denial of benefits can be shown to be a denial of equal protection.</P>



<P>Am I missing something?</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending Constitution</P>



<P>Cary Cheifetz argues that the federal government's interest in marriage is not sufficiently strong to justify a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. Similarly, Prof. Masinter argues that:</P>



<P>"The future of the republic does not turn on whether Hawaii extends legal recognition to same-sex marriages. I would leave it to the good people of Hawaii to govern themselves."</P>



<P>It warms my heart to hear so much concern for state's rights and federalism expressed in a public forum. I, too, am a strong supporter of the right of the people in the several states to decide most issues. And indeed, the people of Hawaii have clearly expressed their will that marriage be defined as a relationship between one man and one woman. But the will of the people has been overridden by an activist court, and because our society is mobile, that court's decision threatens to affect not just the good people of Hawaii but also the good people of Massachusetts, Nebraska, Utah, New York and the rest of the country.</P>



<P>We have a very broad national consensus on the meaning of marriage, the most basic unit in society. This is exactly the situation that justifies an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, an amendment designed to preserve a national consensus on an issue of fundamental importance. This is not a case of the national government depriving the people the right to make their own laws. It is, instead, an act of the People reasserting their right to rule.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>I'm curious about the source of authority for the statement that there is a consensus against same-sex marriage in society. Although no public opinion poll has yet shown a majority of the general population supporting the idea of same-sex marriage, the numbers have been shifting over the past few years as the debate has proceeded. A substantial minority, perhaps more than a third of the general population of the country, is now receptive to the idea of same-sex marriage. When one breaks down these polls by age groups, it turns out that young adults support same-sex marriage by a fair margin, the middle aged are skeptical, and the older part of the population is opposed.</P>



<P>It is also worth noting that the population was overwhelming opposed to interracial marriage at the time the Supreme Court struck down the Virginia miscegenation law in the 1960s.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the U.S. Constitution</P>



<P>In reply to Prof. Leonard's question about the source of numbers on opposition to same-sex marriage, the Hawaii polls taken in March of 1996 and repeated in July or August of 1996 were consistent in showing about 70 percent opposed to it, also national polls in <I>Time</I> (or <I>Newsweek</I>) showed similar results. These polls have not varied in any statistically significant manner for several years. As for the public opinion polls at the time of <I>Loving</I>, the U.S. Supreme Court was quick to point out that only sixteen (as I recall) states had laws on interracial marriage, it was legal and practiced in the vast majority of the states. Thus, the public policy followed by the legislatures in the majority of the states could be considered at least tacitly, if not expressly, to approve of interracial marriages. That is not the case with same-sex marriage. If this were left to the policy making legislative branches, I suspect the debate would be much different.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending the US Constitution</P>



<P>Why not deal with the constitutions and "activist" supreme courts of "small states" by providing that small states may not provide state residents with rights not protected by the U.S. Constitution? This will protect the republic from the crazy notions that regularly come out of Maine, Vermont, Delaware, New Mexico, and Hawaii. Somewhere along the line, some persons who support traditional values have rejected the historic rights of the peoples of the states to form their own constitutions.</P>

<BR>Subject: Let's not prostitute</P>



<P>Let's not prostitute the Constitution to salve the psyches of the homophobic. While I am troubled with the idea of affording homosexual marriages the same legal status as heterosexual marriages (What's the social benefit? What's the harm in not doing it? Gays can still have marriage ceremonies, and make vows of commitment, even without the king's blessing, and can also engage in estate planning to protect their mates), I don't think the federal government has any reason to get involved in such a "family" issue. In fact, I think this issue has even less to do with the federal government than does the "anti-flag burner" amendment which was promoted a few years back -- at least that had to do with a symbol of the federal government. I'm also trying to understand how I, a New Jersey resident, have been adversely affected by the Hawaii Court's decision -- even though I disagree with it, I'm content to let the Hawaii court decide the issue as it sees fit.</P>

<BR>Subject: A Modest Proposal</P>



<P>Who needs a constitutional amendment? Let's simply recognize as true what the religious opponents of same-sex marriage strenuously argue -- that marriage is a religious institution from top to bottom and it is incompatible with sexual practices and preferences that many of the faithful regard as an abomination. What then?</P>



<P>Under the establishment clause, no governmental benefit or penalty may be conferred as a result of marriage or the lack thereof. No pensions, no property rights, no divorce laws, no nuthin'. We then go to a civil system similar to what is used in Europe where anyone, gay, straight or in-between, can sign a contract to live with one another for life and assume all of the legal obligations and benefits that are now associated with marriage.</P>



<P>The various religions are able to keep and defend the spiritual aspects of the institution of marriage and cannot have their religious values transgressed by the government, be it courts or legislatures, and on the other hand everyone stands equal before the law.</P>

<BR>Subject: Amending Constitution</P>



<P>Another thread has begun to develop the significance of government involvement in defining marriage. To summarize very concisely, a careful study of the U.S. Code and the legal codes of states and cities would show hundreds upon hundreds of provisions in which marital status or relationships are relevant to determining legal status, entitlement for benefits, legal obligations, etc. Many of them might only apply to a small portion of the population at any particular time, but taken all together, they create a pervasive significant for governmental recognition of relationships that make this about much more than estate planning or taxes. Try telling the small but significant number of international couples that the federal definition of marriage for immigration and citizenship purposes is not important (and this is not one that private parties can contract around). Try telling the dependent survivor in a long-term, same-sex relationship akin to marriage that the definition of marriage for purposes of Social Security survivor benefits is not significant. (On the purely mundane, everyday level, try telling the couple who are denied access to "married-student housing" at a university because the state doesn't license same-sex marriages that this is not significant. I'm aware of a situation brewing here in New York City at a major medical school where the denial of access to married-student housing for same-sex couples is becoming a major issue -- especially because of the extraordinary housing costs in the NYC metropolitan area.) There are significant equity issues involved almost everywhere you look.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Counsel Connect is a private online community for lawyers, which means it's
the perfect place for you to poll lawyers on particular news issues. For
example, you're writing a story on Dr. Jack Kevorkian and assisted suicide.
Wouldn't it be interesting to learn whether lawyers would convict or acquit
Kevorkian under Michigan's assisted suicide law? Another example. Your
story's on Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President Clinton.
Why not ask lawyers whether the president should be required to go to trial
during his presidential term? You get the picture. And you can canvass 
counsel here. </P>

<P>We'll promote your survey online, and send you results when the survey is
complete.</P>

<P>A few caveats before you dive in. First, like traditional surveys, the best
online surveys take time. Please realize that the tighter your deadline,
the fewer responses you'll get. Ideally, we run surveys for a month before
analyzing the results. </P>

<P>Second, consider that these surveys aren't conducted scientifically.
Responses come, not from a random sample of members, but from members who
choose to go to a particular area of the system, and choose to fill out a
particular survey. Since surveys are anonymous, individuals may vote
multiple times. And, while the overwhelming majority of Counsel Connect
members are attorneys, some non-attorney legal professionals, such as law
librarians, belong to Counsel Connect and may fill out these surveys. So
while you'll get a picture of where the legal community stands on a
particular topic, take our survey method into account when you report our
survey results. </P>

<P>Third, Counsel Connect reserves the right to reject any survey submitted to
us for any reason at all. We can't guarantee we'll run your survey, but
we'll make sure to let you know if we can't. </P>

<P>Finally, if you use our survey results in any way, please attribute the
information to Counsel Connect.</P>

<a href="surveyform.html"><B><I>Submit a Survey Topic to Counsel Connect</I></B></a>


<H4>Examples:</H4>
<P>We also regularly survey our members on some of the important issues
lawyers discuss on Counsel Connect. You may want to incorporate some of our
survey results into your stories. Here are some of our past online polls:</P>

<P><a href="survey3.html"><I>A Fine Line: Ethics and Morals</I></a></P>

<P><a href="survey2.html"><I>Grappling With the Right to Die</I></a></P>

<P><a href="survey1.html"><I>Sexual Harassment: Would You Know it if You Saw it?</I></a></P>

<P>If you have questions about Counsel Connect's surveys, please send e-mail
to <a href="mailto:deirdre.terry@counsel.com">deirdre.terry@counsel.com</a>. </P>

<HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Most of the Counsel Quote Web site is devoted to helping journalists
contact lawyers for expert information about legal issues. But why not have
the inquiries flow both ways?</P>

<P>Counsel Connect members occasionally raise issues they think deserve more
media attention, and this section is designed to help these members
interact with the media in ways that challenge reporters to cover the
justice system and the profession in new way.</P></B>



<H2><font color=ff0000>1. Judicial Administration</font></H2>

<P>From: Martin L. Haines<BR>
Judge, Retired<BR>
Moorestown, New Jersey<BR>
E-Mail: <a href="mailto:mhainesn@counsel.com">mhainesn@counsel.com</a><BR>
Phone: 1-609-235-3813</P>

<P>I have an interest in judicial administration - in how the courts operate
internally.  One major problem: Getting the press interested in the
subject. The reason for non-interest: It is very difficult for the press to
get inside information. Much is secret and court managers are not
communicative for many reasons.</P>

<P>   This would start as a reversal of your present approach, which requires
the press to initiate inquiries. It would require some initial challenges
to the press, ones that, hopefully, would attract inquiries, after which
exchanges would take place.</P>

<P>It is my view that the administrative side of the courts -- much ignored --
is arguably more important than the judicial side, if you set aside the
societal effect of judicial decisions. After all, judges, acting
judicially, only hear and decide, while court managers (which include
judges acting as managers) invent the rules (including ones that discipline
lawyers and judges), raise the monies with which to run the courts, assign
judges, assign cases and decide when and where they will be heard, hire and
fire and assign personnel, etc., etc., etc.</P>
<P><I>More ideas coming soon!</I></P>

<H3>Submission Form</H3>
Here are some guidelines for submitting QRFPs to our standing panels.
They are
intentionally general, because we feel the QRFP should be less
bureaucratic and
formulaic than a standard-issue RFP.

<P>

However, this is just a template -- you should feel free to ask
additional
questions dictated by the nature of the matter you need handled.
Remember: You
can affect the quantity and quality of responses by making your
request as
detailed as you wish.



<P>

PLEASE NOTE:<P>

<LI>Any information provided on this submission is not in any way
confidential.
<P>
<LI>This submission does not in any way create an attorney-client
relationship with either Counsel Connect or any lawyer that responds.
<P>
<LI>By submitting the information and agreeing to use this QRFP service,
you agree that Counsel Connect assumes no liability or responsibility
with respect to the information provided or any subsequent action
taken by you or any lawyer that you may select.
