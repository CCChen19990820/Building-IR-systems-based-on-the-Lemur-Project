<P>

<DT>January 1, 1997<DD>In his monologue, Grodin discusses the past two years of his program and where he looks to in 1997.  Grodin and fomer New York governor Mario Cuomo, former US ambassador to the UN Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick and Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) discuss the status and attitudes of the United States and the global view at this time.  Guests also discuss welfare reform and the adversarial systems in court and politics.  Grodin wishes for a better and more compassionate America for 1997 in his final word
<DT>January 2, 1997<DD>In his monologue, Grodin discusses various racially motivated murders of African-Americans in the past 45 years, disgraces in the American judicial system, and O.J. Simpson's criminal and civil trials.  Court TV's Dan Abrams, author Lawrence Schiller, KCBS-TV investigative reporter Harvey Levin and CNN's Greta Van Susteren join Grodin to discuss the American criminal justice system; the deviation from just a finding of guilty or innocent in cases and basing court cases on broader social issues; the Rodney King trial; Mark Fuhrman's racial bias and lying under oath; the new photographs of O.J. Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes and their affect on the civil trial; the possible relevance to the civil trial of O.J.'s having custody of his children; O.J.'s changed image from a sports hero; and the difference between being at the entire trial and just hearing portions from the media.  Grodin closes the program by saying that defense attorneys' jobs are not to present the truth but to conceal the truth from the jury and that they will knowingly lie in order to win their case
<DT>January 3, 1997<DD>Repeat of 12/30/96 program
<DT>January 6, 1997<DD>In his monologue, Grodin talks about being criticized for bring up many of the social issues in this country and shows why he feels these subjects must be talked about.  KABC radio hosts Larry Elder and Susan Estrich, journalist Julianne Malveaux and syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams join him and discuss what social issues should be talked about in a forum like his program.  They also discuss the ethics charges against Newt Gingrich; campaign
financing; scandals in government; racism in America; affirmative action; welfare reform; how to educate the next generation.  In his final word, Grodin concludes that a poor child in the inner city doesn't have the same opportunity as everyone else does
<DT>January 7, 1997<DD>During his monologue, Grodin discusses remarks made toward him by Professor Alan Dershowitz and Greta Van Susteren.  He discusses individual cases which he has not particularly discussed because he doesn't have information pertaining to the case.  He talks about his upcoming guest, defense attorney Thomas Puccio.  Puccio and Grodin discuss police indictments, defending guilty persons, free speech, search for truth in trials, jury nullification, the Alex Kelly case, sting operations.  Journalist Colonel David Hackworth, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) and Grodin discuss the problems with women in the military, sexual charges, Desert Storm, battle stress, experimentation to test whether women can handle war.  In his final word, Grodin discusses the judicial system of the United States
<DT>January 8, 1997<DD>In his monologue Grodin talks about Paula Jones and the sex scandal involving then-Governor Bill Clinton.  Buzz Bissinger of Vanity Fair joins him to talk about Mark Fuhrman and the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation of his police work and Fuhrman's use of the N-word.  Gregg
Jarrett of Court-TV, KCBS-TV investigative reporter Harvey Levin, criminal defense attorney John Burris and trial attorney Melanie Lomax join to discuss presidents having immunity from civil prosecution while they are in office; Paula Jones' lawsuit against President Clinton; the cut mark on the Bundy glove that was found by the police in the O.J. Simpson case; a possible call to the police inquiring about the double murders prior to 10:30 PM the night of the murders; the defense's attempts to divert attention from factual evidence; the judge's refusal to be diverted from the facts of the case; Simpson's probable return to the witness stand on Friday; how the defense will portray him as a caring, loving man, husband and father; how the prosecution will portray him as the opposite and a liar; the newest photographs of O.J. wearing Bruno Magli shoes; O.J.'s relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson and Paula Barbieri; and the LAPD's failure to find any evidence to indict Mark Fuhrman for misconduct in his history as a police officer.  Grodin closes the program by talking about the National Domestic Violence Hotline and supplying their number for viewers
<DT>January 9, 1997<DD>In his monologue, Grodin talks about injustice in the American justice system, gag orders and consumer advocate Ralph Nader.  Nader joins Grodin to talk about his work as a consumer advocate; his investigations of car manufacturers, defective kidney dialysis machines, health issues and the
tobacco companies; why he became a consumer advocate; why gag orders and confidentiality orders hurt the American public; corporate lawyers and their ethics; HMOs in Nevada; the unsafe GM cars he exposed; vehicle safety equipment he helped to make standard equipment; air bag safety measures; companies that will put out deadly and dangerous products without regard to the consumer; the proposed 50 percent pay increase for Congress that was defeated; and how consumers can become more informed and smarter.  Court TV's chief anchor Fred Graham joins to discuss how some defendants in trials convince the jury of their innocence through lies, impressionism, persona and presentation; O.J. Simpson's presentation of himself to juries and the public; and his perception of what is wrong with the justice system today.  Grodin's final thought is on America's search for the truth
<DT>January 10, 1997<DD>Repeat of 12/19/96 program
<DT>January 13, 1997<DD>Grodin talks about today's developments in the O.J. Simpson case and the attorneys' discussion on one of Geraldo Rivera's shows about the evidence of blood, fiber and hair that was found both at the murder scene and at Simpson's home.  D'Anne Lebon, friend of Nicole Brown Simpson, joins Grodin to discuss Simpson's shirking of responsibility throughout her knowledge of his marriage to Nicole, his drug use, his extra-marital affairs, his abuse of Nicole, his inattentiveness to his children when Nicole was alive, how his public image faded after he left professional football, his jealousy of other men around Nicole, how Nicole and O.J. met, how O.J. reacted to Nicole's pregnancy, and O.J.'s competitiveness and anger over losing games.
