<I>WORLD DATA 1994</I>. From the World Bank's <I>Publications
Update</I>: &quot;The World Bank's first CD-ROM product contains
the most comprehensive set of statistical data that the international
lending agency has ever produced. Covering 1960 to 1992, this
software package features over 700 time-series indicators of World
Bank national accounts, balance of payments, social, trade, external
debt, and finance data. Many, such as current and constant U.S.
dollar national accounts series, are available for the first time.
Data sets from <I>World Tables</I>, <I>World Debt Tables</I>,
and <I>Social Indicators of Development</I> are given as well
as the full text from <I>Trends in</I> <I>Developing Economies</I>
(TIDE).&quot;
<P>
This CD-ROM is not as user-friendly as EconLit, but with patience
you may be able to do an effective search. Since the manual is
a fine example of minimalism, one has to try and figure out most
things on-screen. Searches can be downloaded into ASCII, D-BASE,
LOTUS 1-2-3, AREMOS, or the spread-sheet JAVELIN, which is part
of this package.
<P>

Prescott named Regents' Professor</h3><p>Ed Prescott was named Regents' Professor of the University of Minnesota lastJune.  This is the highest honor the University can bestow on a member of thefaculty.  Ed joins John Chipman, Walter Heller, Leo Hurwicz, and Vern Ruttan asmembers of the department who have been so recognized, a record of achievementthat is unsurpassed by any other department at the University.<p><p>His work in business cycles and the theory of economic policy is well known totoday's graduate students and would have made a strong case for being namedRegents' Professor by itself.  What is remarkable about Ed is the breadth ofhis interests and contributions.  Areas where Ed has done and is doingimportant work include general equilibrium analysis, finance, monetary theory,growth theory and industrial organization.  <p><p>While Ed is perhaps best known for his work in macroeconomics, he rejectslabels that subdivide economics as well as artificial divisions betweentheoretical economics and its applications.  For Ed, economic theory offersorganizing principles that one applies to understand the world.  Perhaps thisapproach to the unity of economic science explains why Ed has been such animportant figure over such a wide range of the discipline.<p><p>Beyond the impact of his own published work, Ed has had a substantial impact oneconomics through his students.  His record of thesis advisor must be unique inthe profession.  Since coming to Minnesota in 1980, Ed has advised 30 Ph.D.dissertations.  His Minnesota students include <b>Fernando Alvarez </b>('94),<b>Ian Bain </b>('85), <b>Antonia Diaz </b>('95), <b>Javier Diaz-Gimenez</b>('90), <b>Andres Erosa-Etchebehere </b>('96), <b>Terry Fitzgerald</b>('95), <b>Gerhard  Glomm</b> ('88),  <b>Ann Guenther</b> ('88), <b>Scott Hakala</b>('89),  <b>Gary Hansen</b> <p><p>('86), <b>Allen Head</b> ('92), <b>Hugo Hopenhayn </b>('89), <b>BruceHorning</b> ('88), <b>Andreas Hornstein</b> ('91), <b>Mark Huggett</b> ('91),A<b>yse Imrohoroglu </b>('88), <b>Beverly Lapham</b> ('90), J<b>oseph Lin</b>('86), <b>George  Lo</b> ('87), <b>Rodolfo Manuelli </b>('86), <b>MichaelMeurer </b>('86), <b>Maria Muniagurria </b>('89), <b>Steve Parente</b> ('90),<b>John Proctor </b>('90), <b>Ricardo Raineri</b> ('93), <b>Jose-Victor</b><b>Rios-Rull</b> ('90), <b>Richard Rogerson</b> ('84), <b>James Schmitz</b>('86), <b>Shinichi Watanabe</b> ('83), <b>Yuo-Jin Yun </b>('89).<p><p>As Wendy Williamson describes below, Ed was recognized by the Board of Regentsat its November meeting.  In his brief comments Ed said that while heappreciated the recognition that came with the nomination by his colleagues, hereally wanted to thank his students and hoped that they had learned as muchfrom him as he had from them.<b></b><p><b></b><p><b></b>The September 1996 issue of <i>The Region</i>, a quarterly publicationof the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, includes an interview with Ed,conducted by <b>Art Rolnick</b> ('73).  When asked who had influenced his work,Ed responded first by naming Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas.  Ed went on to talkabout the impact of working with <b>Rob Townsend</b> ('75) when Rob first wentto Carnegie Mellon:<p><p>Another person that influenced my thinking a lot is Robert Townsend. He was agraduate of the University of Minnesota. He came to Carnegie-Mellon, around1976, as an assistant professor. He introduced me to some of the ideas atMinnesota -- in particular to mechanism-design theory, which can  be used tostudy economic situations where there are contracting problems. This is provingto be increasingly useful in constructing models with financial intermediation.Such models are needed to understand issues such as bank regulation. <p>There are two other people for whom I have incredible respect for makingeconomics better. These two people have been associated with the MinneapolisFederal Reserve bank --  Tom Sargent and Neil Wallace. They along with Lucaswere the ones responsible for the use of dynamic economic theory to studymacroeconomic phenomena. <p><p>When I came here, the University of Minnesota had the only  graduate programthat trained students in the use of dynamic economic theory in the study ofmacroeconomic phenomena. Neil Wallace and Tom Sargent were responsible forthis. I like working with students, and having students trained in dynamictheory made  Minnesota a very attractive place for me. The Minnesota graduatesin macro-economics have had a major influence upon economics and many are nowin positions of leadership in the other top economics  departments. <p><p>The interview concluded with this following exchange:<p><p>ROLNICK:  Let me finish with one last  question that a lot of people wanted meto ask. I have been told, mostly by you, that you were a  pretty good footballplayer in college and that  your bowling average was close to 170. Some say youare no longer the athlete that you once were. Do you accept that view or do youthink you still have a few good years left? <p><p>PRESCOTT: Well, I just made a big decision: I'm going to start playing golf. <p><p><p>The full interview is available on the Web at<p>woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/pubs/region/int969.htm<p><p><br><hr><br><p><h3>A Depression Youth:  <br>Some Experiences</h3><p><b>Remembrances by Clifford Hildreth</b><p><p>At the end of the summer in 1933, Cliff and two of his friends, Kenny and Gib,decided to ride the rails from McPherson Kansas, to the mountains in Colorado.His mother agreed to let him go only after Cliff agreed not to panhandle andnot to hitch a ride on a freight train in McPherson.  The three young men begantheir adventure with $15, $5 apiece.<p><p>Our food plans went something like the following.  The backpack would containmainly non-perishable meat --ham, baloney, canned corned beef.  There would bea few cookies, cheese, crackers and peanut butter snacks and a few fresh items-- apples, carrots, lettuce.  To avoid spillage, we would eat the fresh itemsin the first two or three days.  <p><p>On a typical day we would purchase our three breakfasts at 5 cents each; alarge loaf of day-old bread at 6 cents; and two quarts of day-old milk at 5cents each.  Lunch and dinner would be meat sandwiches (the pack would containa small jar of mustard -- not grey poupon) with milk and with some of the freshitems as long as they lasted.  Sometimes we would have a cracker and/or cookie.In 28 such days, the 31 cent outlay (at deep depression skid-row prices) woulduse less than $9 of our $15 hoard.  Movies were ten cents and huge ice creamcones five cents so one or two instances of indulgence might be contemplated.<p><p><p>Cliff and his two friends spent a very cold night on the top of a moving trainin the high desert of southwestern Colorado.   <p><p>Approximately fifteen transients were sitting in a  compact line that extendedalong the front half of the ... car.  Each person, except for the first, hadhis legs alongside those of the person immediately ahead of him and had hisarms around the chest of that person.  Someone said that one of us should takethe front position now and that the front person was permitted after aboutfifteen minutes to go to the rear where it was warmer and less windy.  As oneworked toward the middle it would be still warmer.  <p><p><p>The train arrived in Pueblo, Colorado, the next morning.  The boys got off thetrain, ate breakfast in a city park and stopped in at the library across thestreet from the park to read the newspaper.<p>In the park Gib had called my attention to a ten inch rip in the seat of mylight seersucker pants.  This was undoubtedly the result of sitting andsometimes sliding a little on rough cut planks on top of last night's boxcar.I got a little view of it in the restroom mirror and it looked terrible.  Aftersome consideration and with great embarrassment, I approached the middle-agedlibrarian and  asked if she had a needle and thread I could borrow.  Iexplained the need.  She had noticed.<p><p>Rummaging through drawers of a nearby desk she found a needle and said she hadplenty of thread but no cloth.  I took the needle and thread to the rest roomand removed my trousers.  The tear looked too much to just tack up.  I needed apiece of cloth.  I folded the handkerchief I had been carrying and found thetear could be completely covered.  I sewed the handkerchief underneath the tearas best I could.  It seemed well fastened except that I could not make a properknot where I finished sewing.  I donned the trousers and explained thecircumstances to the librarian.  She said she could tie a knot that wouldprobably hold a few days if there were no severe stress.  We went to a littleroom used for storage of yet-to-be-catalogued books and she tied the knot.  Ihad returned the needle but  had used quite a bit of thread.  It was to be myonly panhandling of the trip.<p><p><br><hr><br><p><p><h3>Minnesota Economics Association Meeting</h3><p><p><b>Preston Miller</b> ('72) completed his reign as President of the MinnesotaEconomics  Association by presiding over the annual meeting of the MEA at theUniversity.  Faculty member Tom Holmes talked about his work on the impact ofright-to-work laws on the economic growth of states.  <b>Ed Fagerlund</b> ('79)chaired a session on regulation of telecommunications.  Leo Hurwicz introducedJames Tobin who delivered the inaugural Walter Heller Distinguished Lecture.<b>Rob Townsend</b> ('75) delivered the Leonid Hurwicz Distinguished Lecture,"Financial Systems:  From Theory to Data and Back."  <p><p><b>Michael Stutzer</b> ('81) continues as a Director of the MEA and <b>MarshaBlumenthal </b>('85) was elected to a two year term as Director.<p><p>In recent years the MEA meeting has been followed by the Minnesota Meeting onDevelopment Economics.  <b>Karine Moe </b>('95) presented joint work she hasdone with Deborah Levison in the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs on"Household Work as a Deterent to Education Among Girls in Peru."  The evening'skeynote address was delivered by T. Paul Schultz, a member of the Minnesotadepartment in the early 1970s.<p><p><p><br><hr><br><p><p><h3>See  you in New Orleans</h3><p><p>Please join as at the cocktail party for alumni and friends of the department,Saturday evening, January 4, 6 - 8 pm at the New Orleans Hilton-Riverside.Check your convention program for the exact location.<b></b><p><p><p><br><hr><br><p><h3>Recent books by Alumni </h3><p><b></b><p><b>Salih N.

Iseem to have bad timing when it comes to these things.  When John Chipman cameto Hong Kong to give a talk at UST in May 1994, I had to miss it because I wasin the hospital giving birth to my son Nathaniel.  When Chris Sims came herelast fall, I was in the hospital giving birth to Nicole.  We're not planning onhaving any more children, so I'm ready for anyone else who may visit fromMinnesota (I'm hoping Ed Prescott will find his way out here).  Another update:my husband, Dan, is now a Vice President and Regional Telecoms Analyst atSalomon Brothers.

It was fun to sit in on shortclasses, visit the exhibits, meet colleagues, and learn what other schools aredoing with their working paper web-sites and see how we compare.  I alsovisited friends and went sightseeing (i.e. Paul Revere's     house and aliterary tour of Beacon Hill), rode the subway, and ate at some greatrestaurants.  I wasn't able to see the two MN alums in Boston, however,[<b>Steve Parente</b> ('90) and <b>Gianni de Nicolo</b> ('92)] as they were outof town. After the conference a friend joined me and we went to Maine for 5days. What a great state.  It was beautiful - the weather, the ocean,everything! <p><p> I continue to serve on the University's Civil Service Committee this year, andam on the professional development subcommittee (awarding money to employees toattend classes) and I also help maintain the  committee's web-site.  Every yearwe are recognized by the Board of Regents, and this last month I was at thesame meeting where Ed Prescott was honored for his appointment as Regents'Professor.  Ed talked for about 5 minutes and then received a very longovation.  Ed thanked his students most of all and mentioned the rare occurrencethis year of having two native Minnesotans on the job market (Betsy Caucutt andPat Bajari) who also attended Minnesota as undergrads.  Ed also said that theMinnesota school of  economics has a tradition of "doing things right."  Edthen went up to the head of the table to receive his plaque and Regent's medaland to have his picture taken with President Hasselmo and chairman Tom Reagan.I was glad I was there to see Ed get such a deserving award, especially since Ihad helped two years ago with the voluminous paperwork! <p><p><b>Recent Discussion Papers</b> <p>from the Center for Economic Research: <p><p><p>289)	McLennan, Andrew.

Papandreou<br>1919   -  1996</h3><p>Andreas Papandreou, former Prime Minister of Greece, and a member of theMinnesota Department of Economics, died on June 23, 1996.  Papandreou was atMinnesota from 1947 to 1955, when he left to join the department at Berkeley.Papandreou joined the Minnesota department as an associate professor and waspromoted to full professor.  While at Minnesota he published <i>Competition andits Regulation</i> (Prentice Hall: 1954).  In 1972 his book <i>PaternalisticCapitalism</i>  was published by the University of Minnesota Press.<p><p>Scott Maynes who came to Minnesota after Papandreou had left for Berkeleywrites:<p><p>Papandreou visited Minnesota several times.  He was a most charismaticcharacter:  his eyes seemed to burn with zeal.  It bothered me that he seemedto see the CIA under every bed.  (Probably true of <u>some</u> beds, but not<u>all.</u>)  ... But what impressed me most of all about Papandreou was thestrong commitment he inspired in three whom I respected greatly (and who hadnot been close to him for 10 years):  Heller, Hurwicz and Buttrick.<p><p>Papandreou was imprisoned in Athens by the Greek military junta in 1967.  Therewas a real concern that he might be killed in prison and a number of economistsfrom Minnesota were involved in efforts to get him out of prison includingWalter Heller, who visited Papandreou in prison, and Leo Hurwicz. Rememberingthis effort, Ed Foster says<p><p>I was a witness and minor participant in the drive to get him out of prison,led mainly by Buttrick here and others at Harvard and  Berkeley. <p><p>John's goal was to  get to Lyndon Johnson through as many avenues as possible,to ask him to intercede with the colonels to release Andy; there was concernthat he would be killed while in prison. My assignment was to work through thedirector of the Newman Center to reach one or more cardinals who could passalong a request to the president. Others went to senators, and I thinkcongressmen, businessmen, a governor or two ... But, John told me some timelater, the link that actually worked was John Kenneth Galbraith, who was theone person who was willing to spend some political capital on making a directappeal to LBJ and arguing the case strongly enough for LBJ to pay attention. <p><p>John Buttrick adds:<p><p>I think the effort succeeded only because JFK had used a lot of economists andJohnson had inherited them. I heard that not only Galbraith but Bill Capronalso reached LBJ who then is alleged to have phoned the colonels.<b></b><p><b></b><p>While at Minnesota, Papandreou was active in American politics and helpedorganize Adlai Stevenson's local presidential campaign in 1952.

<h3>Alumni Profile:  Robert Eggert</h3>	<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Did you drive a Ford Mustang or covet one when you were young?  If it hadn't
been for Minnesota alum Robert Eggert you might have been driving a Turino
instead.  If you have ever checked your own forecasts against the consensus of
others as measured by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, you again have
Minnesota alum Robert Eggert to thank.<p>
<p>
Robert Eggert grew up in Illinois and came to Minnesota in 1936  after
completing his undergraduate work at the University of Illinois.  He met and
married Betty Bauer while working on his M.S. degree at Illinois.  At Minnesota
Eggert worked with George Garver from whom he "gained a great deal."  Before he
could complete his thesis work, a job as assistant professor lured Eggert to
Kansas State University.   He left Kansas when a job offer from the American
Meat Institute doubled his salary.  Eleven years later a job offer from Ford
moved Eggert from "steers to gears."  <p>
<p>
At Ford Eggert worked in both marketing and economic research.  He worked on
the early development of the Thunderbird and the Falcon.  Other work led Ford
engineers to accelerate their introduction of automatic transmissions.  It was
Eggert who suggested the name Mustang for the sporty car Ford developed in the
mid sixties.  The name came from a book of the same title his wife had given
him for Christmas 1960.  Lee Iacocca, the developer of the car, favored the
name Turino.  Eggert says, "We tested about 17 different names, and Turino
wasn't on the bottom, but it was awful close to the bottom."  He now has a
collection of vintage Mustangs.<p>
<p>
From Ford, Eggert moved to Michigan State where he helped establish a program
in Agribusiness, one of the first at land-grant colleges.  In less than a year
the private sector, this time RCA, again lured him away from academe with a
vice presidential title.  In 1976 Eggert left RCA, moving from Connecticut to
Sedona, Arizona, because of his wife's health.  At Ford and RCA, Eggert had
been involved in both marketing and economic research.  RCA kept the marketing
research in-house but used outsiders, including Eggert, for their economic
research.   When he moved to Sedona he established Eggert Economic Enterprises
and became editor of <i>Blue Chip Economic Indicators</i>.  <p>
<p>
<i>Blue Chip Economic Indicators</i> is a recognized standard against which to
measure individual forecasts.  The consensus forecast has a strong track record
for accuracy of its own.  His subscribers include the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors as well as the White House.  The idea of consensus forecasts as a
benchmark began when Eggert worked with Robert McNamara at Ford.  He further
developed the idea while working for RCA where he consulted a panel of 25
economists.   Now Eggert contacts over 50 forecasters each month and polls them
on their forecasts for the growth of GDP, inflation, unemployment and a dozen
other macro-economic measures.  <p>
<p>
Now in his early eighties, Eggert continues an active work schedule.  Besides
his national forecasts, Eggert assisted in the founding of the Economic Outlook
Center at Arizona State University which publishes metropolitan, state and
regional forecasts.  His calendar is full with speeches, board meetings,
testimony and consulting commitments.  While much of his life's work has
focused on short-time forecasts, Eggert is optimistic about the true long run.
He sees the emergence of free market forces and global markets as important
forces for optimism.  While concerned about excessive growth of  world
population, Eggert is optimistic that a technological breakthrough will make
alternative sources of energy competitive.  "Low energy costs, combined with a
persistent work ethic, pollution control and greater free enterprise will make
tomorrow's world a better place."<p><br>

<h3>A Depression Youth:  <br>
 Some Experiences</h3><p>
<b></b>Remembrances by Clifford Hildreth<p>
<p>
I have the impression that I was born tired and have been fully rested.  As far
as I know the only other notable feature of my birth was the size of my ears.
My older sister tells me that as I approached age one my wingspread made her
uncertain whether I would walk or fly.<p>
<p>
It is easy to understand why Cliff might have felt tired when one reads about
his 1933 summer job in Kansas:<p>
<p>
When school ended the third week in May, I went directly to a crew laying a gas
pipeline from McPherson to Concordia, about eighty miles north.  The work was
hard but paid 50 cents per hour, my highest wage to date.  We worked a 44 hour
week with occasional overtime.  The general manual labor rate that summer was
40 cents per hour.   Several of my friends were working seven hours per day in
gasoline service stations or in retail stores for $30 per month.<p>
<p>
Our friendly foreman assigned one of the harder jobs to me and a college
student.  We were on the painting crew.  After a civil engineer and his
assistant had marked the path ahead with colored cord, a ditching crew with a
mechanical digger dug a trench about thirty inches deep and twelve inches wide.
A welding crew welded 15 foot sections of six inch pipe together and suspended
the resulting tube on wooden blocks about a foot above the trench. <p>
<p>
The other painter and I were given a three-layer strip of burlap about seven
feet long with handles affixed to each end.  This was looped around the tube in
slanting fashion so the handles were about five feet apart.  When one handle
was pulled upward the burlap spun around the tube spreading paint that was
poured on the pipe by another painting crew member.  He placed it about eight
inches ahead of the constantly moving loop.  We painters pulled our handles up
alternately.  Pulling one handle up lowered the other to the level of the pipe.
The front painter pulled up and a little forward, the back painter pulled
almost straight up; this keep the loop moving forward.  Each upward pull was
about like lifting a 40 pound weight two or three feet.  A cycle (upward pull
by each painter) took about ten seconds and moved the loop about two feet
forward.  Two other members of the painting crew removed the wooden block ahead
of us as we approached it and then placed it under the painted pipe immediately
behind.  There were brief rest periods about a half hour apart.  A new burlap
strip was furnished at each rest period. <p>
<p>
The paint was hot melted tar with added ingredients, creosote being prominent.
Learning to ignore the odor took several days and splashes on skin or clothing
produced blisters.  The contractor intended that the crews should lay at least
one mile of pipe each day and this was typically achieved or slightly
exceeded.<p>

<h3>Congratulations</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Rosa Matzkin</b> ('86) and former faculty member <b>Ken Wolpin</b> were
elected Fellows of the Econometric Society in December 1995.  Rosa is at
Northwestern and Ken is now at Penn.<p>
<p>
<b>Tom Sargent</b> received the  Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics from
Northwestern University this spring.  The prize is awarded every other year to
individuals with careers of "outstanding  achievement, as demonstrated by major
contributions to new knowledge or the development of significant new modes of
analysis. " The prize carries a $100,000 stipend.  Consistent with the terms of
the bequest, past recipients of the Nobel Prize and current or former full-time
members of the Northwestern faculty are ineligible for the Prize. <p>

<h3>Alumni Notes</h3><p>

<b>Josef Hadar </b>('62) has retired from Southern Methodist University, and is
moving to Israel.<p>
<p>
<b>Ramu Ramanathan's </b>('67) site on the web can be found at:

<p>
<b>Art Rolnick</b> ('73) and his wife Cheri were featured on the cover of
<i>Northwest Racquet Swim &amp; Health</i>.  The Rolnicks have been active
participants in the Northwest ballroom dance program for the past five years
and competed locally this winter.  Of dancing Art says "It's like going to
proms all the time.  You get all dressed up.  It tends to look romantic and it
can be, but it's really a sport.  I used to like the wing and Latin dances but
as I've learned more about the smooth dances (waltz, fox trot, quick step and
tango), I like those dances better.  I don't think American men are generally
very good at Latin dances.  It requires amazing control of your body.  You have
to be able to isolate different parts of your body and control the movements.
It's very hard.  With the smooth dances you don't have to do as much of
that."<p>
<p>
<b>Fred Johnson</b> ('80), working at General Motors Europe has been overseas
since 1991, first in Zurich and now in Russelsheim, Germany.  His past
assignments included forecasting car sales, being chief economist, and doing
planning.  He is now director of product cost reduction, which puts him in the
middle of technical, purchasing, marketing, manufacturing and finance
activities.  Fred notes, "In case there was any doubt that our industry was
competitive, I can assure you it is, and I find myself on the sharp edge!"<p>
<p>
Fred continues, "I still have time to think about arcane topics such as
economics.  In fact, I was discussing 'customer value' today with a couple of
engineers in my group (half in English, half in German) and actually drew a
supply and demand curve ('angebot und nachfrage,' as we say it here).  If
there's any moral to this, it's that there's life after economics, but the
economics still comes back to haunt you!"<p>
<p>
<b>Alfonso Martinez</b> ('81) wrote  from Argentina about the last newsletter
and added a story of his own:<p>
Since I don't have anything close to Tapen's performance, I will just tell you
my little story: I usually go to a rowing club about 20 km from Buenos Aires,
in the city of Tigre.  A couple of months ago when I walked into the club, I
looked at a guy whose face was familiar, but I said to myself: this isn't true,
it is ridiculous, I looked away so that this person wouldn't wonder why I was
staring at him.  To make the story short, it was <b>George McCandless</b> ('81)
who was also staring at me![George moved to Argentina last year]  Isn't it a
small world?  Needless to say how happy we were to meet each other.  By the
way, do you know if there is any TV program willing to pay $6000 for this? <p>
<p>
A short update: I married Marita in 1985.  We have four kids: Alfonso (9), Ana
Maria (8), Estefania (6) and Aranzazu (2).  I teach at the Argentine Catholic
University and at the Center of Macroeconomic Studies of Argentina.  Besides
that I do economic consulting.  Once in a while I sleep too!<p>

<b>Eudald Canadell</b> (MA '88) wrote to us in November of '95.  "As of January
1st, 1995 I left the position I had for five years as Director of Economic
Analysis and International Relations at the Spanish Securities Commission, to
take up a job as Secretary General of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO), in Montreal, Canada; a position to which I was
elected by its General Assembly in October 1994 in Tokyo.  IOSCO is a
non-profit international organization that regroups the National Securities
Commissions of the majority of the countries with market economies (or with
established securities markets) of the world.  So far we have members in 74
countries, representing nearly 95% of the world market capitalization.  IOSCO
was created in 1983... and works closely with other international
organizations....  There is an enormous amount of literature on our work that I
could make available to those interested in these issues and I would be happy
to provide it, as well as any additional information on this and related areas
and organizations."  Eudald can be reached at OICV/IOSCO, C.P. 171 Tour de la

<b>Ted Herzog</b> (MA '95), now at Stanford Law School, will be working at a
St. Paul law firm this summer: Winthrop and Weinstine.  At Stanford Ted also
has an editing position with the <i>Stanford Journal of International
Law</i>.<p>
<p>
<b>Francois Ortalo-Magne </b>('95) e-mailed us from the London School of
Economics about his experience as economics commentator on Mad Cows.<p>
<p>
As soon as it started getting in the front pages, I recorded an interview for
CNN evening business news and gave another one to the <i>Herald Tribune</i>.
After that, journalists called every day for a period of 3 weeks.  The reason
is not really that I was an expert; I knew nothing about the problem until my
first request for interview.  It is just that when journalists would call the
LSE press office, I was the only faculty registered as having some knowledge
about agricultural economics issues.  <p>
<p>
I quickly found some good contacts in the agricultural world around here, spent
my days reading news reports and started to respond to every interview
request.  In all I gave about 20 ranging from BBC World Service to Singapore
TV, <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> Canadian papers and TV etc.... Never refuse an
interview from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, they pay quite well for
it, most of the others don't.  Recording one for the main French evening news
was great for all the family members back home who had not seen me in a while.
The most enjoyable was to be invited by CNN International to comment live in
the evening news on the agricultural secretary's  first main response to the
crisis in Parliament.  <p>
<p>
The experience was interesting in itself in that I learned a bit how to deal
with journalists, how some of them are so good at making you say what they
want, whereas others try their best to report accurately the message you are
trying to convey.  The challenge is now to see if I can get a paper out of this
quickly acquired expertise! <p>

As a postscript to the last newsletter's story, <b>Tapen Sinha </b>('86) wrote:
"I appeared on the show AGAIN - this time, with my brother - a double dose of
drinking water through the nose!  This is the first time in the history of
personkind this act was performed on TV by two brothers with PhDs in
Economics!!  The host announced, 'You have heard of the Marx Brothers, now
comes the Sinha Brothers...'  They changed the format of the show.  Now they
have two celebrities doing the judging.  One was pregnant and the other one had
a baby.  So, when a little kid appeared (it really didn't matter what he did!)
they just went 'awwwwww, ain't that cute.'  Needless to say, that sealed our
fate!  We did not win anything (just $250 for appearing, plus they flew me to
Sydney)." <p>

<h3>The Department On Line</h3><p>
<p>
The department's homepage is now fully functional, which means it is in
a continuous state of evolution.  Items that might be of particular interest
include electronic versions of our graduate program brochure and undergraduate
handbook, a posting of job market candidate CVs, and electronic access to
recent newsletters, the alumni directory and the Economics Research Library.
The ERC Library posting includes a listing of discussion papers that the
Library has received over the past 4 and one half years.  Under Netscape, once
a file has been downloaded you can use the 'Find' option under 'Edit' to search
the file.  The electronic version of the Alumni Directory includes hot links to
personal homepages.  If yours is not included please let Wendy or Craig know
and we will add the link.  If you would like a paper copy of the latest
directory, please contact Wendy.<p>

<p>
<h3>ECONOMICS RESEARCH LIBRARY</h3><p>
<b></b>Wendy Williamson<p>
<p>
The library's web pages have been up since January  and are a convenient way to
access the monthly list of new papers and books.  A new feature is the journal
collection list.  Use this to check to see if we own a particular title or
year.<p>
<p>
So far I haven't been able to get to the "Spring Roundup," so you alumni who
STILL HAVE ITEMS CHECKED OUT please return them!!!  The record offender (you
know who you are) has had books out for 22 years....is he REALLY expecting to
finish that thesis??  A fine of 25 cents per day for 22 years would be enough
to support our current book budget for one year (computed without interest).  I
think it's time to collect!<p>

<h3>John Kareken Retires</h3><p>
<p>
Jack Kareken retired this spring after 39 years at Minnesota.  Jack was born
and raised in Buffalo, New York.  He did his undergraduate work at the
University of Buffalo where he majored in Philosophy and Economics.  From
Buffalo, Jack went to MIT where he received his Ph.D. in 1956.  Jack joined the
Department of Economics at Minnesota that fall.  In 1981 he was appointed
Minnesota Professor of Banking and Finance in the Carlson School of Management,
University of Minnesota and continued as a member of the Department of
Economics.  Jack served as chairman of the Department of Finance for nine
years.<p>
<p>
In addition to his academic appointment at Minnesota, Jack served as a
consultant to a number of official agencies and commissions, including the
Commission on Money and Credit, the US Treasury, and the Joint Economic
Committee.  His appointment as economic advisor to the president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis played a pivotal role in the development of the
Research Department at the Minneapolis Fed.  Jack held this position for 16
years.  He had the ability to make academic research understand-able and
relevant to policy makers.  They in turn lent their support to the academic
interests of their research economists.  Jack was also involved with the
private sector serving as consultant to Golembe Associates and most recently as
a member of the Board of Directors of First Bank System in Minneapolis.<p>
<p>
Jack was honored at a retirement dinner in July organized by Neil Wallace and
<b>Mike Stutzer</b> ('81).  After dinner a number of speakers commented on
Jack's work and the critical role he played at the University and at the
Minneapolis Fed.  <b>Preston Miller</b> ('72)  called attention to Jack's 1983
paper, "Deposit Insurance Reform:  deregulation is the cart, not the horse,"
both because of the prescient quality of the analysis and because of Jack's way
with words:<p>
<p>
"Possibly it is because I was raised in a city or because my uncle, on whose
farm I passed a few hardly idyllic childhood summers, was too shrewd.  Whatever
the reason, I have never been able to understand how one puts a cart before a
horse.  Shrewd as he was, Uncle Clarence never once even tried."<p>
<p>
Neil Wallace commented on Jack's unwillingness to make easy compromises and his

<h3>NEW   FACULTY</h3><p>
<p>
<h4>Gautam Gowrisankaran</h4><p>
<b></b><p>
Gautam Gowrisankaran joined the department this fall as an Assistant Professor
after having just completed his Ph.D. at Yale.  Gautam did his undergraduate
work at Swarthmore where he majored in economics with a minor in mathematics
and a concentration in computer science.  Gautam's thesis, written under the
direction of Steve Berry and Ariel Pakes,  involves several essays addressing
issues about the dynamic behavior of firms.  Part of Gautam's thesis involves
an investigation of anti-trust policy done in the context of some path breaking
work on dynamic simulations of industry equilibrium.   Gautam is also working
on a dynamic model of the hospital industry, using discrete choice models where
the quality of service offered by different hospitals is important for consumer
choice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Tom Holmes</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Tom Holmes is a new associate professor this fall.  Before joining the
department Tom was a member of the Research Department of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Minneapolis.  Before coming to the Fed, he had been on the faculty at
Wisconsin.  Tom received his Ph.D. from Northwestern.  Some of his early work
focused on price discrimination in imperfectly competitive markets.  More
recently Tom has been working on theoretical and empirical models of interstate
competition for businesses and economic development.  He is also involved in
joint work with <b>Jim Schmitz</b> ('86) on entrepreneurship and the dynamics
of firm growth.  This work involves the manipulation of very large data sets
for both estimation and simulation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Lee Ohanian</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Lee Ohanian comes to the department this fall as an assistant professor
from the University of Pennsylvania where he was a member of the faculty for
three years.  Before starting graduate work at the University of Rochester, Lee
worked for Security Pacific Bank in California where he was Vice President and
Economist.  While working at Security Pacific, Lee became interested in
questions about vector autoregressions and time series modeling.  Several
papers, including one with <b>Gerry Nickelsburg</b> ('80), came from this
interest.  At Rochester, Lee worked with Tom Cooley.  Lee's thesis on the
macroeconomic effects of war finance in the United States is forthcoming as a
book.  <p>

of Fellows in the Spring 95 newsletter.<p>
<br>
<h3>Can Anyone Top This? </h3><p>

<b>Tapen Sinha</b> ('86) wrote this summer, "Did I tell you about my recent 15
seconds of national (Australian that is!) fame?  There is this TV show called
the Funniest People.  Probably an Aussie version of an American show (like
Funniest Home Videos).  Anyway, we were watching the show one day and I said to
my wife, 'I can do something funny.'  She asked me what I had in mind so I said
I will drink water through my nose, which I do every day anyway.  An audition
was going on at Seaworld, so I signed up for it.  We did our stuff.  First,
Rebecca got in front of the camera and said, 'Here is an amazing act: drinking
water through the nose.' Then I did that and she said, 'You don't believe he is
actually drinking the water?' and I started to spit the water through my mouth.
They decided to put that on the show.  It was voted the best by the audience
and I won about $6,000 worth of Hoover stuff: two fridges, a huge washer, a
dryer, three vacuum cleaners, etc.  I already had all of that and my brother
just got back from the U.S., so I shipped them off to him in Sydney.  Now he
has a "houseful of Hoover."  I had lots of reaction from my past students.  I
got several faxes, phone calls, etc.  They just could not believe I could do
that!  I even got a fax from Papua New Guinea.  They showed it there too!  I
then went to a conference in Melbourne.  The person organizing the registration
material looked at me and said, 'Sinha, right?'  I said to her, 'Boy, you have
an amazing memory, you remember me from last year!'  She said 'No, you were on
TV!' There was my fifteen seconds of fame, as Warhol would have put it." (For
the 90's it's 15 seconds, not 15 minutes.)<p>
<br>

<h3>MV = PY and MV = PY 2</h3><p>

<b>Tapen Sinha</b>  also wins the Bill Weiler Prize for Economist Trivia as the
first MN grad, not at Stanford, who identified the owners of the cars with
these plates.  They are Milton and Rose Friedman.  Tapen adds, "the car does
not say MV=PY, it says MV - PY because you cannot put an = sign on a license
plate because of some California law.  It is a Cadillac convertible."<p>

<h3>Notes from the Chair</h3><p>
	Craig Swan<p>
<p>
A memorial service for Cliff Hildreth this fall was both a sad and a joyous
occasion.  While Cliff's passing brought sadness to family and friends, the
memorial service was an opportunity to celebrate a very full life.  Speakers
included Leo Hurwicz who had known Cliff from days at Iowa State and Phil Raup
from the St. Paul campus who had grown up with Cliff.  John Geweke reports that
an important influence on his early interests in econometrics was a class he
took  as an undergraduate at Michigan State from William Ruble, a student of
Cliff's.  Cliff left some memories of growing up in Kansas, especially during
the 1930's.  Excerpts from these reminiscences will appear in subsequent
newsletters.<p>

<center><h2>Clifford Hildreth<p></h2>

<center><h3>December 8, 1917 - August 15, 1995</h3><p>
</td></tr></table>
</center>


<p>
Clifford Hildreth was born in McPherson, Kansas.  He called himself a war baby
(WW I), a boom child (1922-1929), and a depression youth.  Memories of his
youth include sweeping the dust out of the YMCA during the dust bowl with his
friends in return for use of the gymnasium and a cold shower (the hot water had
been turned off as part of an economy measure) along with a month long trip
hopping freight trains from Kansas to Denver and Estes Park, Colorado.  Upon
graduating from high school Cliff won a competitive scholarship to the
University of Kansas.  Work as an undergraduate research assistant during his
senior year developed his respect for and interest in careful academic inquiry.
In 1942 Cliff married a fellow graduate student, Mary Lou McGee.  Graduate
studies at Iowa State were interrupted for three years when Cliff volunteered
for an aviation navigation program in the United States Navy.<p>
<p>
After receiving his Ph.D., Cliff stayed on at Iowa State as a member of the
faculties in economics and statistics for several years before moving to
Chicago where he was active in both the Department of Economics and the Cowles
Commission.  During the following decade he held professorships in agricultural
economics, first at North Carolina State University and then at Michigan State,
where he also served as department head, 1958-60.<p>
<p>
Cliff came to Minnesota in 1964 after a long courtship and numerous offers.  At
Minnesota he was a member of the Departments of Economics, Agricultural and
Applied Economics, and the School of Statistics.   Cliff held visiting
appointments at numerous universities.  He was a consultant to many federal
agencies and professional associations.  He was a Fulbright lecturer in Japan
in 1970, editor of the <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association,
</i>(1960-65), and President of the American Statistical Association, 1973.<p>
<p>
He was devoted to his students and dedicated to his teaching and research.  He
also took a special interest in the department library and was especially
concerned that students have easy access to the most current scholarship.  His
personal contributions form an important part of the Economics Research Library
collection.  <p>
<p>
His scholarly interests focused on econometrics and mathematical economics.
His work with John Lu on the estimation of models with autocorrelated
disturbances is known to all students of econometrics.  The Hildreth-Lu
procedure is one of the standard tools used by econometricians.  Cliff made
important contributions in other areas of statistics, in particular
nonparametric inference, as well as in economics, including activity analysis,
agricultural economics, and the theory of social welfare functions.<p>
<p>
Over the last 15 years of his academic career, Cliff's interests focused on
trying to understand the behavior of economic agents under uncertainty.
Reflecting his upbringing in rural Kansas he applied that interest to trying to
understand the behavior of farmers.  <p>
<p>
Following his retirement in 1988, Cliff and Mary Lou moved to Eugene, Oregon to
be nearer to their children and where they were able to purchase and enjoy
their own woodland.<p>
<p>
Cliff's writings and correspondence have been deposited in the William R.
Perkins Library at Duke University.<p>
<p>
A number of people have asked about memorial gifts in honor of Cliff.  The
family has asked that memorial gifts be directed to either the Chamber Music
Series at the University of Oregon or to the Clifford Hildreth Memorial Book
Fund in the Economics Research Library.  <p>
<p>
Gifts to the Chamber Music Series should be sent to<p>

<h2>Alumni Profile: </h2><p>
<h3>	Richard Sandor<p>
</h3><p>
It may seem like a long way from being a graduate student at  Minnesota
to  Chairman and CEO of Centre Financial Products, a risk management firm that
specializes in developing financial products that bridge capital and insurance
markets.  Richard Sandor ('67) has traveled this road and sees a great deal of
continuity in the questions that have concerned him.  His thesis, written under
Jacob Schmookler, investigated the links between firm size on the one hand and
patents and innovation on the other.  From a concern about the invention and
creation of products, his attention has shifted to the invention and creation
of markets.  For his work as the principal architect of Treasury Bond futures
and options contracts, the Chicago Board of Trade and the City of Chicago named
him the "father of financial futures."  <p>
<p>
Richard came to do graduate work in Economics at Minnesota in the fall of 1962.
While Minnesota already had a strong reputation, Walter Heller's time in
Washington brought special attention to the department.  That  and a
competitive offer of support resulted in Richard arriving in Minneapolis.<p>
<p>
He especially remembers courses from Oz Brownlee, Anne Krueger and Leo Hurwicz,
and talks about how valuable the ideas from these courses and individuals have
been.  In his word they provided "a rock solid foundation."  He came to his
thesis work after course and seminar work with Jacob Schmookler.  <p>
<p>
In 1966 the Sandors moved to Berkeley where Richard took up a position in the
Business School at Cal.  He started trading stocks as a hobby and at the
suggestion of a colleague started reading the commodity literature with an eye
to trading commodities.   He soon wondered why one could not standardize
financial commodities.  Wasn't mortgage origination like harvesting?  Richard
was soon teaching a course on futures and options markets -- a first in the
Business School as this material had previously been the province of the Ag
Econ department.  <p>
<p>
In the early 1970s Richard took leave from Berkeley to spend a year at the
Chicago Board of Trade working on financial and insurance futures.  He stayed
as Vice President and Chief Economist for the Board of Trade.<p>
<p>
Richard reports that in the early 1970s interest in financial futures was a
hard sell and he had two strikes against him coming from Berkeley and, before
that, the midwest, neither known as centers of financial innovation.  While
others may have been seduced by the relative stability of the economy since
World War II, having seen the social instability at Berkeley Richard was not so
sure.  Events in 1974 -- the oil embargo, the increase in food prices and the
spike in interest rates -- led to renewed interest in financial futures.  <p>
<p>
Oversight of futures markets had been located in the Department of Agriculture.
 A number of new commodity contracts developed in the 1960s were not regulated.
Congressional hearings in 1974 led to the creation of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Richard reports you know you have arrived when you have
your own regulatory agency.  Key language in the CFTC legislation defined
commodities as tangible and intangible goods and services for future delivery.
At the time Richard argued that the effectiveness of a regulatory agency
devoted to developing markets could well hinge on the ratio of lawyers to
economists on the commission's staff.<p>
<p>
The broader definition of commodities was critical to the development of
financial futures.  The first new contract approved by the CFTC was Ginnie Mae
mortgage bond futures.  The CFTC was initially staffed with people from the
Department of Agriculture.  Richard reports that while developing the Ginnie
Mae contract the staff of the CFTC wanted to know if the Chicago Board of Trade
had enough storage capacity should they have to accept delivery on GNMA
contracts.   Working at the Chicago Board of Trade, ContiCommodity Services,
Drexel Burnham Lambert, Kidder Peabody, and Centre Financial Products, Richard
has been intimately involved with the development of markets for interest rate
futures, futures contracts for electric power, pollution rights, derivatives
based on real estate values, and catastrophe derivatives.  Along the way he has
also taught at Stanford, Northwestern and Columbia.<p>
<p>
His describes his current interests as having two major foci.  One involves
work on micro and macro indices.  His work on insurance futures is one example
of this interest as well as his work on crop yield futures contracts which are
scheduled to debut in early June.  Using crop yield and price contracts would
allow farmers to hedge their total revenue.  <p>
<p>
His other current interest is in environmental issues.  In 1990 Richard found
himself involved in designing contracts for sulfur dioxide emissions.  These
contracts under EPA sponsorship are now regularly traded under the auspices of
the Chicago Board of Trade.  Richard invited Ronald Coase to the Board of Trade
when these contracts were first traded.<p>
<p>
Richard is now involved with efforts to find market based solutions to
worldwide environmental problems under the sponsorship of UNCTAD.  He is
skeptical of the ability to successfully negotiate complicated multilateral
treaties involving 180 countries and hopeful that market based solutions may
prove a workable alternative.  <p>
<p>
At Columbia, Richard recently taught an advanced graduate seminar in the
Graduate School of Business entitled  "Environmental Finance."    He reports
that the class developed environmental markets for the spotted owl and
biodiversity.   Talking about the class at Columbia reminded Richard of when
Jon Goldstein, <i>Mr. Spotted Owl</i>, was writing his thesis at Minnesota on
wetlands.  A number of Jon's classmates pitched in to buy Jon a duck.  <p>
Richard and Ellen divide much of their time between New York and Chicago.
Ellen is a well known computer artist.  She has an appointment at Northwestern
and an affiliation as Adjunct  Artist with the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications in Champaign-Urbana.    In addition to his work
with Centre Financial Products, Richard is a member of the Board of Governors
of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a Major Benefactor of the Art
Institute.  He looks back at his time at Minnesota as intellectually invaluable
and a major contributor to his subsequent success.<p>

Trivia as the first Minnesota Ph.D. to correctly identify Stan Kostka.  Kostka
was a star halfback for the Golden Gophers in the 1930s when they were an
American football power.  When he left Minnesota in 1934 "a bidding war erupted
between Dan Topping's Brooklyn Dodgers and Bert Bell's Philadelphia Eagles, for
the services of Stan Kostka ... After the smoke had cleared, Kostka had signed
with the Dodgers for the almost unheard-of salary of $5,000 (as much as the
premiere player of the league, Bronko Nagurski (another Minnesotan) was earning
with the Bears.)  At the next meeting of the league, Bell proposed a
reverse-order-of-finish college draft, which has been a part of the NFL rules
since that time. "  (<i>Pay Dirt : The Business of Professional Team
Sports,</i> James Quirk and Rodney D. Fort, Princeton University Press,
1992.)<p>

<h3>Notes from the Chair</h3><p>
	Craig Swan<p>
<p>
This spring we have been honored to host a visit from Hirofumi Uzawa.
Professor Uzawa has been at Minnesota as a Hill Visiting Professor, a
competitive program of the Graduate School at Minnesota to sponsor scholars
with distinguished international reputations.  Many economists of my generation
had their first encounter with Professor Uzawa when reading his article on the
two sector model of economic growth  In recent years more of his attention has
focused on questions of environment and pollution.  While at Minnesota he
offered a seminar on "Intertemporal Preferences and Sustainable Development."
Professor Uzawa has been using recent developments in the theory of
intertemporal preference orderings to formalize the concept of sustainable
development and analyze how the allocation of resources at different points in
time can support sustainable development.  Just before coming to Minnesota he
was named to the Interministerial Commission in Japan to oversee the rebuilding
of the city of Kobe following the tragic earthquake there.  While at Minnesota
he was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.<p>
<p>
This newsletter includes a profile of Minnesota alumni Richard Sandor.  On a
cold day in February, Richard and his wife Ellen appeared in the department
unexpectedly.  I knew of Richard's work but had not had the opportunity to meet
him or Ellen.  We had a wonderful conversation about earlier times at Minnesota
and some of their current interests.  Richard and I subsequently talked by
phone.  That conversation is reflected in the profile in this newsletter.  We
hope to make alumni profiles a regular feature of the newsletter. <p>
<p>

<P>The Department of Economics at Minnesota funds their own library,
the Economics Research Library. It is also called the Jacob
Schmookler Reference Room, in honor of the late Professor Schmookler,
who donated many books to the library. The ERL is housed in the
Science Classroom Building, just above the Center for Economic
Research, which is an office area for graduate students and visitors
to the department. The library overlooks the Mississippi River, with
a view of downtown Minneapolis.</P>

<P>The library was started in 1967 and first consisted of loaned
books and journals from department professors. A fund was then
established for purchasing books and journals. The most important
part of the collection, however, is the discussion (or working) paper
series. These are articles distributed before their publication in a
journal. We acquire these papers in exchange for our discussion
papers with other economics departments around the world. Working
papers are not collected by the University Library system, and few
economics departments have such an extensive collection as ours.</P>

<P>Besides journals, books, and working papers, the library also
collects some reprints and government documents. We also have a
reference collection consisting of economics directories, publishers'
catalogs and lists of working papers from many other institutions.
The ERL also subscribes to the CD-ROM index EconLit, which indexes
economics journal articles from 1969 to date and some working papers
from the mid-80s to date. The computer index is available for use by
students and no appointment is needed to use it.</P>

<P>The Economics Library is for use by faculty and graduate students
only of any University department. Services include: Reference by
phone (612-625-2307); distribution of the monthly "Recent Acqusitions
List" (now available on this web site); advice on setting up your own
working paper collections at other institutions (contact me, see
below); and a copy machine that patrons can use for copying library
materials at 5 cents per copy. Library hours are usually every
weekday (with occasional announced closings) from 1:00 - 4:30pm.
Location: 525 Science Classroom Building, first building to the left
of the Washington Avenue Bridge (approaching from the West Bank), top
floor, facing the river. Please contact me if you have any questions.
