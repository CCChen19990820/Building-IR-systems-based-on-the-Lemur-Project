THE USE OF ION BEAM SURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES FOR CORROSION PROTECTION:</B> <I>P.M. Natishan</I>, E. McCafferty, G.K. Hubler, B.D. Sartwell, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Ion beam alloying techniques overcome many of the problems associated with conventional alloying and provide a means to produce new and unique corrosion resistant alloys. These techniques can be used to tailor metal surfaces to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface without affecting the bulk properties of the metal. In addition, novel metastable phases unattainable by conventional alloying can be produced, and scarce or critical materials can be conserved since only the surface of the metal is alloyed. This paper will discuss advances in and issues related to various ion beam alloying techniques including ion implantation, ion beam mixing and ion beam assisted deposition as related to their application to corrosion protection.

CORROSION RESISTANT ALLOYS AND COATINGS PRODUCED BY PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION:</B><I> Barbara Shaw</I>, Elzbieta Sikora, Tim Miller, Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802<P>
Evaporation techniques, such as PVD and CVD are increasing in popularity as methods for tailoring surface properties for specific engineering applications. One of the attributes of PVD is the ease with which graded, layered and nonequilibrium coatings and alloys can be produced. Not surprisingly, defects, coating morphology and deposit composition strongly influence deposit properties such as strength and corrosion resistance. As an example of how passivity enhancing species influence corrosion resistance, the addition of 8 at% Mo to Al (via electron beam PVD) was found to increase the pitting potential 600mV over that of pure Al. Similar enhancements have been observed with Al-Ta alloys. In addition to the constant composition deposits, graded and layered coatings can also be used to improve corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. In this presentation, the results of an ongoing investigation of nonequilibrium Al and Mg deposits ( both constant and graded composition deposits) produced via electron beam PVD will be presented and discussed.

THE ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF METAL SURFACES SUBJECTED TO PULSED ION BEAM SURFACE TREATMENT:</B> <I>N.R. Sorensen1</I>, R.G. Buchheit1, K.S. Grabowski2, T.R.

Box 5800 Albuquerque, NM 87185; 2Naval Research laboratory, Code 6670, Washington, DC 20375; 3Department of Materials Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853<P>
Pulsed high energy ion beams have been used to thermally treat metal surfaces to alter their electrochemical response. Two general processing regimens have been explored: 1) rapid melt and resolidification (RMR) and 2) ion beam mixing (IBM). RMR uses the pulsed ion beam to melt and in some cases ablate the top most several microns of the surface. Subsequent solidification is sufficiently fast (&gt;106K/s) for nonequilibrium structures and compositions to be attained. IBM uses the ion beam to mix a previously applied metallic layer into the substrate to produce a compositionally and structurally distinct surface alloy. The surface that results from these treatments often displays interesting characteristics. For example, a Grade-2 Ti sample, which pits at a potential of 1.7V, is immune to pitting up to 2V following ion beam treatment. This talk will discuss the changes in electrochemical behavior of several alloys following ion beam treatment.

CORROSION INHIBITION MECHANISMS IN EPOXY COATED ALUMINUM:</B> <I> R.D. Granata</I>, R.C. MacQueen, R.R. Miron, M.M. Madani Zettlemoyer, Center for Surface Studies, Lehigh University, 7 Asa Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18015<P>
Corrosion inhibition mechanisms in model systems were evaluated for use in barrier-type protective polymeric coatings systems. Emphasis was on complaint, low VOC coatings applications technologies such as powder coatings, UV-cured and electrocoating systems on aluminum substrates. Candidate inhibitor systems wee studied using low VOC epoxy polymer and porous polymer films on conversion coated, aluminum alloy 2024. Inhibition in these systems was observed in short exposure times. The model defect systems were studied using electrochemical impedance and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopies. The positron lifetime measurements determined free volume cavity sizes and concentrations through which corrosion-active species diffuse. Electrochemically active and inactive (positron accessible) regions within the polymer matrix were monitored versus water saturation. Corrosion inhibitors modified the polymer matrix barrier properties in regions adjacent to the filler particles. Inhibition processes will be discussed relative to known mechanisms.

CYCLIC OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF AN ALUMINIDE COATING FORMED ON DESULFURIZED Ni-BASED SUPERALLOYS BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION:</B> <I>Y. Zhang</I>1, W.Y. Lee2, K.M. Cooley2, I.G. Wright2, P.K. Liaw1; 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; 2Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831<P>
The cyclic oxidation behavior of Ni-based superalloys can be significantly improved by lowering the level of sulfur impurities in the alloys to below ~1 ppm. This presentation addresses the feasibility of preparing a low-sulfur bond coat, which would be compatible with desulfurized single-crystal superalloys and therefore could be attractive for possible use in advanced thermal barrier coating applications. Rene N5 substrates containing ~3 ppm and ~0.4 ppm sulfur were aluminized using a chemical vapor deposition technique. The level of sulfur incorporated into the aluminide coating was measured as a function of coating thickness by glow discharge mass spectroscopy. The effects of the sulfur content on the cyclic oxidation behavior of the aluminized substrates and the morphological stability at the scale-coating interface were studied and compared.

AN XPS STUDY OF THE ROLE OF NITROGEN IN OXYANION FORMATION DURING AQUEOUS CORROSION OF MOLYBDENUM AND CHROMIUM NITRIDE COATINGS:</B> <I>G. Halada</I>, C. Clayton, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY 11794-2275; J. Beatty, J. D. Demaree, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5069<P>
A dual electrode electrochemical approach, in combination with variable angle X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, was used to determine the role of nitrogen in the generation of oxyanionic species, MoO42- and CrO42-, from MoN and CrN coatings. During simultaneous anodic polarization of a coupling of Fe and either pure Mo and Cr or their respective nitrides in deaerated 0.1M HCl, the presence of nitrogen was found to enhance the formation of molybdate and chromate oxyanions. These oxyanions deposited back onto the nitride surfaces as insoluble salts formed with cations released from the iron electrode. The increased formation of oxyanions is postulated to be the result of deprotonation of electrolyte in contact with the nitride coating and a subsequent shift in pH to higher values. In addition to acting as a kinetic barrier, the oxyanionic species act as an electrostatic barrier to the ingress of the Cl- anions which cause pitting.

Recently we reported the formation of highly corrosion resistant &quot;stainless steel&quot; based alloy coatings formed using the JVD process. In this paper, a detailed study aimed at obtaining a fundamental understanding of the passivation mechanisms operating in these alloy coatings is reported. Passivation behavior of the coatings was determined by electrochemical polarization in 4.0M and 0.1M solutions respectively. The surface chemistry of the coatings was studied using XPS and correlated to the observed passivation behavior.

SYNTHESIS OF IN-SITU TiAl-BASED COMPOSITES FROM ELEMENTAL POWDERS:</B> D.E. Alman, J.A. Hawk, U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, Albany, Oregon 97321<P>
Alloys and composites based on the intermetallic compound TiAl are emerging as an important class of light-weight, high-temperature structural materials. Recently, it has been recognized that these alloys have applications in industries, such as the automotive industry, where cost is frequently a major concern in materials selection. However, for these alloys to be used in this type of application, new low cost methods for high volume component fabrication are required. One potential fabrication approach is reactive synthesis (also termed combustion synthesis). This technique involves initiating an self-propagating, high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction within an intimate mixture of elemental powders. This process has been used to fabricate intermetallics, ceramics and in-situ composites in the form of powders and dense monoliths. SHS reactions tend to initiate at low homologous temperatures of the forming compound (for aluminides near or at the melting point of Al, 660&#176;C), and tend to go to completion in a short period of time (i.e., a few seconds). For some compounds, particularly aluminides, the reaction is ac companied by the formation of transient liquid phases. These factors can reduce the required processing parameters (time, temperature and pressure) needed to produce dense products by reactive synthesis techniques compared to conventional powder metallurgical approaches. This paper characterizes the reactions that occur and resultant microstructures of TiAl based composites fabricated from ternary mixtures of elemental Ti, Al and B or Si powders. Mixtures of the elemental powders were prepared corresponding to TiAl reinforced with 0, 10 25, 60 and 100 vol. pct. Ti5Si3 or TiB2. The powders were consolidated by reactive hot-pressing (at 1000&#176;C and 20 MPa for 1 hr). It was found that the composites produced from Ti, Al and Si powders were dense, and the elemental powders transformed to the target phases of TiAl and Ti5Si3. Whereas, composites produced from the Ti, Al and B powders were porous and inhomogeneous, that is several aluminide (TiAl, Ti3Al and TiAl3) and boride phases (TiB2, AlB12, TiB) formed during hot-pressing. The different behavior observed by the two ternary systems can be attributed to both reaction sequence and phase diagram considerations. First, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) revealed that an endothermic reaction associated with the formation of Al-Si eutectic occurs prior to the initiation of an SHS reaction within the mixtures of Ti, Al and Si powders. No such pre-reaction melting occurred within the mixtures of Ti, Al, and B powders. Thus, the &quot;extra&quot; transient liquid phase that formed during the reaction between Ti, Al and Si systems enhances diffusion (hence homogenization) and densification within this system during reaction processing. Also, an examination of phase diagrams reveals that there exists no Al-Si compounds to compete with the formation of titanium-aluminide and titanium-silicides during reactions between Ti, Al and Si powders. However, there are several aluminum-boride phases that can compete with the formation of titanium-aluminide and titanium-boride during reactions between Ti, Al and B powders. The implications of this study is that TiAl-based composites can be designed for densification during reactive processing.

REACTIVE SYNTHESIS OF NiAl-Nb COMPOSITE FROM ELEMENTAL POWDERS:</B> L. Farber, A. Lawley, I. Gotman, Department of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104; I. Gotman, E. Y. Gutmanas, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel<P>
A NiAl matrix composite reinforced with Nb particles was synthesized in the solid state from blends of ultrafine elemental Ni, Al and Nb powders. The fabrication method involved consolidation of elemental powder blends to full density followed by heat treatment. The maximum processing temperature did not exceed 800&#176;C. Kinetics and the sequence of phases formation during synthesis were investigated. For Ni-Al-Nb blends, consumption of Al with the formation of Ni-Al intermetallic phases only was detected in the temperature range 425&#176;C-550&#176;C. Subsequent heat treatment at 800&#176;C resulted in rapid completion of the synthesis reaction with the formation of the NiAl matrix. No reaction occurred between Nb particles and the matrix during synthesis. The phase stability of the composite in the 800&#176;C-1100&#176;C temperature range was investigated. Mechanical properties of the synthesized material are discussed in the context of resulting microstructure.

FeAl-TiC AND FeAl-WC COMPOSITES - MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES:</B> <I>R. Subramanian,,</I> J.H. Schneibel, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6115<P>
For applications of TiC- and WC-based cermets in corrosive environments, a potential binder material is an intermetallic, iron aluminide. In this investigation, it is shown that iron aluminide (Fe-40 at %Al) bonded TiC and WC composites can be processed to almost full density (&gt; 99%) with carbide volume fractions ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 by conventional liquid phase sintering and pressureless melt infiltration techniques. The melt infiltration process was successful in the fabrication of composites with carbide volume fractions greater than 0.7 and important aspects of this technique will be discussed. Mechanical property data such as bend strength, hardness and fracture toughness will be presented and interpreted in terms of the composite microstructures. For FeAl-WC composites containing 60 vol.% WC, room temperature three-point bend strengths and fracture toughness values reached 1680 MPa and 20 MPa.m1/2, respectively. Consistent with the high fracture toughnesses, the fracture surfaces showed evidence of ductile deformation of the FeAl binder.

DEOXYGEN IN SILICIDE FORMATION:</B> Chi-Fung Lo, Darryl Draper, Materials Research Corporation, Orangeburg, NY 10962<P>
A preliminary study on the deoxygen behavior of tungsten-, molybdenum- and tantalum-silicide formations using powder technique was performed. During the synthesis under vacuum, the transformation of amorphous to crystalline silicon and the formation of silicides were monitored by X-ray diffraction. The oxygen content in the materials at various phase-transformation stages was measured. The results indicated that, independent of the synthesized metals, no significant change in the oxygen content was found until the formation of metal-disilicides. Via the formation of disilicides, the oxygen decreased from 1000-3000 ppm to less than 500 ppm. In this study, the exothermic behavior of silicon phase transformation and the silicide formations was also investigated.

TITANIUM/TITANIUM CARBIDE COMPOSITE FORMATION BY GAS-SOLID IN-SITU REACTION:</B> Yong Jin Kim, <I>Hyungsik Chung</I>, Department of Materials Processing, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, 66 Sangnam Dong, Changwon, Kyungnam 641-010, S-Korea; Suk-Joong L. Kang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1 Kusong-Dong, Yusong-Gu, Taejon 305-701, S-Korea<P>
Sponge titanium powder was die compacted and reacted with carbonaceous (CH4) gas at the temperature range of 700-1,000&#176;C. Layered TiC film was formed uniformly on the surface of the powders in the green compact. The thickness of the TiC layer varied with the reaction temperature and time. The reacted compacts were sintered in a vacuum up to 1450&#176;C. During the sintering, the TiC layer in the power surface was broken into small fragments and the fragment changed gradually into round shaped particles with increasing the sintering temperature. The relative sintered density over 94% was obtained at the sintering temperature of 1350&#176;C for 2hrs. Ti/TiC composite containing up to 50 v/o of TiC was successfully made by the in-situ reaction and sintering. The volume of TiC in the sintered body mainly depends on the reaction temperature, time and Ti powder size. But the gas flow rate during the reaction affected little to TiC volume in the sintered composite.

PROCESS-STRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS FOR TAPE CASTING OF CONTINUOUS FIBER-REINFORCED MMC'S:</B> Shin Yu and Dana M. Elzey, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
The tape casting process offers a potentially cost-effective manufacturing route for continuos fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites. However, the ultimate performance is limited by the presence of microstructural defects, which evolve to an extent which depends sensitively on the constituent materials and processing conditions used. Results of an experimental study are reported in which the evolution of several important microstructural defects have been investigated for various processing conditions. These observations have been used as a basis for the development of predictive process-structure models for the tape casting of MMC's. The models may be used to explore processibility and cost issues for hypothetical matrix/fiber composite systems and processing conditions.

FIBER FRAGMENTATION DURING PROCESSING OF METALLIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Nicole M. Gorey</I>, Donald A. Koss, John R. Hellmann, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802<P>
Fiber fragmentation can be a serious problem during the processing of metallic matrix composites. This research focuses on the fracture of continuous sapphire fibers during composite consolidation. During the latter stages of consolidation, matrix flow along the fibers may cause fiber fracture even in the absence of fiber bending. Fiber fragmentation by this mechanism has been examined using a theoretical analysis which predicts the extent of composite flow as a function of processing parameters and the resulting fiber fragmentation lengths. In order to validate the analysis, a model composite system, which consisted of a tin matrix and degraded sapphire fibers, has been &quot;hot pressed&quot; at room temperature to simulate elevated temperature consolidation of sapphire-reinforced Ni-base composites. A comparison of observed and predicted fiber fragmentation lengths indicate good agreement. The analysis can readily be applied to predicting conditions that should be used to prevent extension-induced fiber fracture during high temperature consolidation of structural composites. The research was supported by NASA.

FCB RETROFITTING OF ALUMINA ROTARY KILN: WHEN DRASTIC FUEL SAVING MEETS INCREASED CAPACITY:</B> <I>Vincent Giroud</I>, Andre' Pinoncely, FCB- subsidiary of the Fives Lille Group, Mineral Processing and Carbon Plant Division, 32, rue fleury Neuvesel, BP 24-69702 Givors Cedex.<P>
Alumina calcination using rotary kilns is an expensive operation. In 1972 an innovative concept of kiln retrofitting was introduced which greatly enhanced the overall thermal efficiency while preserving most of the existing capital equipment. As a result, nine kilns have been retrofitted over the last eighteen years, gradually highlighting the wide range of possible arrangements and the relevant strong process and mechanical reliability. This paper draws up the main features of these retrofits, namely the substantial energy saving and the correlative increased capacity. Long-term observations also demonstrated that alumina quality remains as consistent as previously with no significant impact on the calcined alumina size distribution. The latest retrofitting pattern including new cyclones and ducting arrangements are presented yielding a fresh look for a still useful technology.

ALUMINA CALCINATION WITH THE MULTI-PURPOSE CALCINER:</B> Jorgen Ilkjaer, Lars Bastue and <I>Benny E. Raahauge</I>, FLS Minerals A/S, Alumina &amp; Bauxite Technology, Vigerslev All&eacute; 77, DK-2500 Valby Copenhagen, Denmark<P>
The Gas Suspension Calciner (GSC) and the rotary kiln are both well proven technologies for calcination of alumina. The GSC is mainly used for production of smelter grade alumina and the rotary kiln for special grade alumina. A multi-purpose calciner which combines these two technologies has been designed, constructed and commissioned in the summer of 1996. By combining these two calcination technologies it is possible to produce a wide range of alumina qualities only by changing a few parameters in the operation using a Fuzzy II Logic Control System and a CemScanner.

PREDICTING MOISTURE CONTENT ON ALUMINAS FROM MEASUREMENT OF WATER ISOTHERMS:</B> <I>A.R. Gillespie, </I>Comalco Research Centre, Thomastown, Vic., Australia; M.M. Hyland, J.B. Metson, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand<P>
Water adsorption isotherms on alumina can play an important predictive role in aluminium smelting since the level of moisture on the alumina influences its handling, feeding and dissolution characteristics, along with the potential for generation of emissions. Measurements of adsorption isotherms of water on smelter aluminas indicate moisture pick-up and loss is rapid, with initial rates of change in adsorbed water in excess of 0.1 wt% per minute, meaning the <I>ex-situ</I> measurements are not likely to be accurate. Adsorption and desorption curves, to water pressures in excess of 20 Torr, indicate near complete reversibility. The discrepancy is attributed to the irreversible formation of Al(OH)3. Analysis of the shape of the curves suggest several distinct mechanistic regimes within the adsorption curve.

Heat conductivities are measured in alumina powders treated with 0-7 wt% NaAlF4 at varying temperatures up to 900&#176;C. The <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> transition of alumina, triggered by addition of NaAlF4, was found to be essential for the observed increase in heat conductivity. A maximum heat conductivity was measured at 3.5 wt% NaAlF4 for aluminas heated to 700&#176;C and at ~2 wt% NaAlF4 for heat treatments at 800 and 900&#176;C. The heat conductivity was also measured versus temperature after the samples had been sintered. A decrease in heat conductivity with increasing sample temperature was observed. A mathematical model for the thermal conductivity of porous materials was applied and tested against the measured data, confirming the importance of sintering with respect to thermal conductivity. The relevance of the present findings concerning heat balance of industrial smelting cells is discussed.

RECOVERING ALUMINA, SILICA AND BYPRODUCTS FROM COAL ASH THROUGH THE USE OF PROCESS FOR SILICON PRE-EXTRACTION:</B> <I>Victor L. Rayzman</I>, 933 Regal Road, Encinitas, CA 92024; Solomon A. Shcherban, 110 Bennet Avenue, #3H, New York, N.Y. 10033<P>
The large volume of coal combustion wastes cause a problem of great concern in environmental protection. Only about a quarter of these wastes are being used today, generally for construction materials production. At the same time, many million tons of aluminum and silicon contained in coal ash are lost in landfills annually. Of all the large number of processes for recovering alumina and byproducts from aluminum and silicon-bearing wastes only one, the lime-soda sintering process, has been commercially used on nepheline residue and red mud. To approach ash composition similar to these above-mentioned wastes, a process for silicon pre-extraction has been developed and pilot plant tested. The method reduces the material stream trough the sintering kiln in half and produces high pure silica alongside the alumina and calcium silicate. The heat consumption for the new process is estimated significantly lower than that for the sintering method and approaches the Bayer technology indices.

FEATURES OF ALUMINA PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY FROM ALUMINOSILICATE RAW MATERIAL WITH POTASSIUM'S HIGH CONTAIN:</B> <I>V.A. Lipin</I>, N. N. Tikhonov Russian National Aluminium-Magnesium Institute (VAMI), 88, Sredny pr., St. Petersburg, 199026, Russia<P>
Aluminosilicate raw materials have large differences in chemical and mineralogical structure, particularly in the relationship between sodium and potassium. Large deposits of raw materials with high portions of potassium alkalis are known and have been studied for the purpose of the industrial processing by the sintering and hydrometallurgical methods. Technological features of the processing of the high-potassium aluminosilicate raw materials utilize for the most part the processes of sintering, leaching and desilication. The optimum molecular ratios of the main components before sintering were found in each case. Distribution of alkaline metals between liquid and solid phases during leaching and desilicating was determined. Utilizing experimental data, equations have been developed predicting the dependence of desilicating indexes from chemical composition of processing ores. These relationships aid in choosing the most effective conditions for research of promising raw materials.

ON THE BATH FLOW, ALUMINA DISTRIBUTION AND ANODE GAS RELEASE IN ALUMINIUM CELLS</B>: <I>Ove Kobbeltvedt,</I> Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; Bj&oslash;rn P. Moxnes, Hydro Aluminium, Technology Centre &Aring;rdal, N-5870 &Oslash;vre &Aring;rdal, Norway<P>
The bath flow was studied in prebake cells. The measurements were performed by recording the drop in bath temperature subsequent to alumina feeding as well as by measuring the wear of quartz rods immersed in the bath. The horizontal flow rate varied between 3 and 20 cm/s. It was found that the horizontal bath flow and consequently the alumina distribution pattern are determined mainly by a combined effect of the magnetic fields and the width of the channels above the working surface of the anodes. The quantity of anode gas which was drained into the centre channel was measured at different locations in a cell. The result showed that the distribution of the anode gas in the bath is strongly associated with the magnetic fields.

ALUMINA DISTRIBUTION IN POINT-FED HALL-HEROULT CELLS:</B> <I>K. T&oslash;rklep, </I>K. Kalgraf, T. Nordb&oslash;, Elkem a/s Research, P.O. Box 8040 Vaagsbygd, N-4602 Kristiansand, Norway<P>
We describe the alumina concentration distribution in point-fed Hall cells in terms of finite physical elements. The need arose in the development of the New S&oslash;derberg technology at Elkem Aluminium ANS, but the technique is applied to prebake pots as well. The concentration at any point in the bath is computed from the dynamical equilibrium between consumption and transport of alumina (directly or indirectly dissolved) and presented as contour plots. Necessary inputs are the velocity field in the bath and the turbulent diffusivity, either measured or calculated. We prefer to measure both by injecting a small amount of a molten radioactive tracer and follow the distribution of this tracer <I>in situ.</I> Measured velocity fields have been found to vary significantly between presumed identical pots and over time. This is mainly ascribed to convective coupling with the metal, where the boundary conditions and hence the driving forces may well differ between pots and change with time. Contrary to extant models, our approach permits experimental verification through comparison of predicted and measured oxide concentrations at various locations in the pot under investigation.

METAL PAD WAVE ANALYSIS USING FAST ANODE LOWERING METHOD:</B> <I>H. Q. Tang</I> and N. Urata, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation, Center for Technology, P.O. Box 877, Pleasanton, CA 94566<P>
In order to study the metal pad wave in aluminum reduction cells, the two step fast anode lowering method was developed and applied to the operating cells. The metal pad waves after anode lowering were measured and analyzed. The period and shapes of the metal pad waves were determined by performing Fourier transform analysis of the measured data. The MHD wave equations were solved for cells of different magnetic fields to simulate the metal pad waves caused by this fast anode lowering. The period and shapes of the predicted steady state waves were in good agreement with the measured waves, although the measured wave had more transient nature. The cell stability was evaluated based on the metal pad wave analysis.

IMPURITY TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>M. Webster,</I> Xiaoling Liu, Comalco Research Centre, Thomastown, Victoria, Australia; J. Metson, Department of Chemistry, University of Auckland, New Zealand<P>
The purity of aluminum from pre-bake reduction cells is affected by the quantity of impurities introduced with the raw materials and the fraction of these reporting to the metal. The transport of Ti, V, Ga, Si, Fe and Ni from the reduction cell to the duct emissions stream has been studied for point feeder and bar break cells. Samples of material from bath, cell cover and duct emissions have been examined and analysed for a range of impurities. For elements with volatile, bath generated fluoride compounds, the impurity content of the cover and duct samples is proportional to the carbon content. Carbon grains with thick (&gt;10 micron) impurity rich surface coatings are observed in both the loose cover samples and particles from bath skimmings. Thus a possible mechanism for the transport of these impurities may be postulated.

PSEUDO RESISTANCE CURVES FOR ALUMINIUM CELL CONTROL--ALUMINA DISSOLUTION AND CELL DYNAMICS</B>: <I>Halvor Kvande</I>, Hydro Aluminium a.s, P.O. Box 80, N-1321 Stabekk, Norway; Bj&oslash;rn P.

The pseudo resistance was measured as a function of the alumina concentration in the bath in five different types of cells. The pseudo resistance showed a minimum value of 5.0 to 5.5 mass% Al2O3, when the bath samples were analyzed by the LECO method. To the left of the minimum point on the curve the slope increased gradually until the anode effect occurred at 1.6 to 2.2 mass% Al2O3, while a nearly linear curve was found in some of the measurements. The difference in pseudo resistance determined just prior to the anode effect and at the minimum point, corresponded to a voltage difference between 100 and 300 mV. Immediately after the alumina feeding rate was reduced from overfeeding to underfeeding, a so-called &quot;hysteresis effect&quot; could be observed. This was characterized by a sudden decrease in cell voltage of about 100 mV in less than 30 minutes, in spite of practically constant bath composition and temperature in this time period. This effect may be caused by dissolution of alumina sludge in the bath phase <B>above</B> the metal pad, accumulated during the long overfeeding period of several hours, needed to reach concentrations to the right of the minimum point on the curve.

THE INFLUENCE OF SODIUM ON THE ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>Mohamed O. Ibrahiem</I>, Mohamed M. Ali, R&amp;D Department, Aluminium Company of Egypt, Naga Hamadi, Egypt<P>
Sodium always present in Hall-Heroult cells, has a decisive influence on cell performance and pot failure. In this paper, sodium was studied from three points of view. The first is the sodium mass balance. Alumina and cryolite are the major sources of sodium inputs to the electrolytic process, where 56.8% and 40.7% of sodium come from them, respectively. The second point is the sodium content in aluminium metal. Measured sodium content in aluminium of 203 kA prebaked cells is lower than that of 155 kA S&oslash;derberg due to lower bath ratio, higher excess aluminium fluoride, and higher magnetic fields. The third point is the study of sodium concentrations in failed carbon cathodes at different ages. This concentration at 3194 days is 8.5%, 7%, and 1% higher than that at 40, 60, and 1369 days, respectively.

STUDY ON CATHODIC PROCESS OF Na+ IN THREE-LAYER ELECTROLYTIC REFINING OF ALUMINIUM:</B> <I>Li Guohua,</I> Li Dianfeng, Zhao Xiangguo, Wang Qingna, Department of Nonferrous Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110006, China<P>
The Current-Voltage Method is adopted to study the cathodic process of Na+ in three-layer electrolytic refining of aluminium. The electrolyte studied is NaF-AlF3-BaCl2-NaCl molten system, whose composition is: NaF/AlF3 mole-ratio is 1.5-3.0, adding amount of NaCl is 0-8%, BaCl2 content is 60%. It is demonstrated that Na+ is not able to deposit on the aluminium cathode at the temperature range of 740-800&#176;C while the cathodic current density is 0.4-0.8 A/cm2. This conclusion provides an important basis for modifying the electrolyte in three-layer electrolytic refining of aluminium.

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS FOR CONTROL OF THIN FILM GROWTH:</B> <I>A.G. Jackson</I>, S.J.P. Laube, J. Jones, TMC, Inc., Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433<P>
Control of thin films during the growth process is dependent on several difficult-to-monitor parameters, including flux of film material, pressure, substrate temperature, composition, and thickness. One means for easing this difficulty is to take advantage of emission spectra associated with the process and the film. For pulsed laser deposition (PLD) the ion cloud generated by the laser has characteristic emission spectra that can be used to control the deposition. Raman spectroscopy affords the possibility of real-time control by sensing characteristic peaks associated with film composition and thickness. These spectroscopic methods offer a real-time alternative to process control that is very attractive because of the ability to accurately control films to achieve the engineered structures and properties sought. Examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of these methods for this film preparation.

RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY FOR DETERMINING YBCO THIN FILM PARAMETERS IN SITU:</B> David P. Lubbers, Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; John D. Busbee, <I>A.G. Jackson</I>, TMC, Inc., Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433; Rand R. Biggers, David C. Liptak, SOCHE, Dayton, OH<P>
This paper describes the application of Raman spectroscopy for characterizing superconducting YBCO thin film parameters. Attenuation of the substrate Raman spectrum as a function of material deposited is established. Also, a correlation between film quality and Raman spectrum is explored. The identification and discrimination of superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases of YBCO is presented. The critical temperature (Tc) of a film as a function of its oxygen content is also established using Raman peak ratios. These results provide significant implications toward the use of Raman spectroscopy for in situ monitoring and control of the PLD process. Film quality can be controlled via optimization of film oxygen content and reduction of improper YBCO phases. Film thickness can be controlled by monitoring the response of the substrate material. Also, the PLD process can be studied and modeled using this powerful observation tool.

INTELLIGENT PROCESSING OF MATERIALS: AN APPLICATION TO POLYMER COMPOSITES:</B> <I>J.F. Maguire, </I>M.A. Miller, Materials Development Dept., Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX<P>
The process control of polymeric components is a difficult problem in modern process control. These materials consist of a chemically reactive resin which impregnates a reinforcing fiber. The resin is subject to aging phenomena and is found that frequent adjustments of the process are needed in order to assure quality of the product. In order to increase quality and reduce manufacturing delays the manufacturing process was analyzed from a physico-chemical standpoint and intelligent control system was developed and implemented. It was determined that integration of a novel advanced sensor technology based on in situ Raman and Rayleigh light scattering with a state-of-the-art chemical kinetic and polymer transport model of the polymerization process would provide real (sensor) and virtual (model) information on which material process control decisions could be based. The sensor information provides chemical and physical analytic data in real-time. This data is analyzed and compared with the predictions of the model and adaptive control decisions are implemented. The control system was interfaced with customized processing hardware via a programmable logic controller (PLC) employing conventional ladder logic. The system has been tested extensively and has been able to process adaptively advanced composite components fabricated from quartz reinforced polyimides. Finally, the process logic control algorithms, which rely on the physical and chemical state of the material based on sensor information, are generic to any chemically reactive resin with minor modifications to initial parameter values.

ALUMINUM SENSOR FOR STEEL GALVANIZING BATHS:</B> <I>R.Sridhar, </I>J.M. Toguri, Dept. of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M4S 3E4, Canada<P>
The aluminum content of zinc galvanizing baths is an important parameter for producing good quality steel sheets for automotive applications. The present method of bath sampling and chemical analysis measures the total aluminum content of the bath which includes dissolved aluminum and aluminum in entrained dross. Also, this method does not provide quick analysis for process control purposes. It has been reported that the measurement of dissolved aluminum is essential to obtain a good zinc coating on steel. Laboratory experiments have shown that an electrochemical cell consisting of an aluminum electrode, an ionic fused salt and an electrode like Mo (inert to Zn) dipping in the zinc bath has good potential for quick dissolved aluminum measurements. Such a sensor can be ready adopted for process control. These results will be discussed.

SOLID-STATE ALUMINUM SENSOR FOR USE IN MOLTEN ZINC:</B> <I>J.W. Fergus, </I>S. Hui, Materials Research and Education Center, 201 Ross Hall, Auburn University, AL 36849<P>
Aluminum is an important alloying addition to the zinc used in the hot-dip galvanization of sheet steel to control the properties and appearance of the resulting coating. Optimization of the galvanization process requires control of the alloy concentration, which can be improved through the use of chemical sensors. Aluminum sensors, based on molten electrolytes, are commercially available but are not widely used because of their high cost. One approach to reducing the cost is to use a solid electrolyte, which can simplify the sensor design and, thus, reduce the cost of fabrication. In this paper, the development of an aluminum sensor based on a solid fluoride electrolyte, specifically magnesium fluoride, will be described.

APPLICATIONS OF Al SENSORS IN CONTINUOUS GALVANIZING:</B> N. Qiang, <I>N.-Y. Tang</I>, G.R. Adams, Cominco Ltd., Product Technology Centre, Sheridan Science and Technology Park, Mississauga, Ontario L5K 1B4 Canada<P>
Aluminum is the most important alloy addition to Zn baths for controlling the reaction kinetics between the steel substrate and molten Zn in continuous galvanizing operations. The control of effective bath Al content is particularly critical for galvannealing where a high bath Al content may lead to incomplete alloying during postannealing, and a low bath Al content may result in other problems, such as an excessive bottom dross accumulation and difficulties in coating thickness control. The amount of Al in a galvanized coating has a strong influence on coating properties and the overall product quality. Yet, due to the complexity of the Zn-Fe-Al ternary system, the measurement and accurate of Al sensors has made the real-time measurements of bath Al contents possible. To facilitate their application, a computer interface and a palm-size data logger have been developed. Plant applications indicated that the sensor possessed sufficient accuracy for process monitoring and control. Potential benefits of Al sensor applications include improvements in process control and product quality, reductions in product transition periods for dual product lines, and a reduction in the overall production cost.

A PYRIDINE-BASED TRIDENTATE CHELATING SOLVENT EXTRACTION SYSTEM FOR SELECTIVE EXTRACTION OF NICKEL AND COBALT</B>: Batric Pesic1, and Taili Zhou2, 1University of Idaho, College of Mines-McClure Hall, Moscow, ID 83843; 2The Shepherd Chemical Co., 4900 Beech St., Cincinnati, OH 45212<P>
A novel pyridine-based tridentate chelating extractant, 2,6bis-[5-n-nonylpyrazo-3-yl] pyridine (BNPP), has been developed and characterized. The solvent extraction of Ni and Co by a mixed system of BNPP and dinonyl naphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNSA) was studied as a function of pH, diluent, temperature, and DNNSA concentration. Stripping of Ni and Co was examined as a function of HCl and H2SO4 concentration. The novel system can extract Ni and/or Co selectively against Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, and Al from acidic sulfate solutions at a pH as low as 0.5. Separation of Ni and Co can be achieved either during loading, or during stripping stages of solvent extraction. The extractant system is stable and can be regenerated with acid. The novel solvent extraction system was also tested on the real solutions produced by leaching of cobalt bearing concentrates, (1) cobaltite concentrate from Blackbird Mine, Idaho, and (2) siegenite concentrate from Lead-Belt, Missouri. A flowsheet for recovery of cobalt and nickel has been proposed based on these studies. The review of the current status of solvent extractants for cobalt and nickel will be given by comparative presentation with our novel extractantion system.

The effects of potassium ethyl xanthate used as collector and dichromate potassium a depressor on a PbS mineral were studied by the recently accepted technique in Mexico, high frequency impedance (transformed to dielectric values). Results of dielectric values at 100 MHz suggested that is possible to obtain from isotherm adsorption the adequate industrial collector concentration being this in the range of 1E-3 to 5E-3M of KEX. The e' values (320-420) in the PbS-KEX system was increased as the KEX concentration was lowered). In the other hand the PbSK2Cr207 system showed higher values of e' (420-510) as the K2Cr207 concentration was increased. The PbS-KEX-K2Cr207 system was evaluated, obtaining the KEX concentration dominion on K2Cr207.

GYPSUM CRYSTALLIZATION IN ACIDIC WASTEWATER TREATMENT: A REVIEW OF CURRENT PRACTICE AND A VIEW ON PROCESS IMPROVEMENT:</B> <I>S. Omelon</I>, G.P. Demopoulos, McGill Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, 3450 University St., Montreal, Canada H3A 2A7<P>
Acidic sulphate-containing wastewater streams are currently neutralized with lime before discharge to the environment. The most common neutralization process design involves a one-step neutralization followed by a settling tank that separates an ultra-fine, low solids density gypsum by-product. The final gypsum quality is undesirable as it is voluminous and has a high surface area that sorbs metal ions. The paper will critically review the current practice of gypsum precipitation. It will also report the progress of a project which uses crystallization principles and supersaturation control to develop a new process. The new process design utilizes a model that was constructed to predict gypsum solubilities in H2SO4-ZnSO4-FeSO4-MnSO4-MgSO4 solutions from 25-60&#176;C. By maintaining a low gypsum supersaturation with a series of CSTR's and providing gypsum seed with a solids recycle, the generation of high solids density gypsum is favoured. Early results will be presented, as well as results on Zn2+ adsorption.

ANALYSIS OF THE HEMATITE PRECIPITATION PROCESS FROM A CRYSTALLIZATION POINT OF VIEW:</B> T.C.-M. Cheng, G.P. Demopoulos, McGill Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, 3450 University St., Montreal, Canada H3A 2A7<P>
Iron removal and disposal in zinc and nonferrous hydrometallurgical plants at large constitutes one of the major environmental challenges to the industry. So far three technologies have been used by the zinc industry to effect iron rejection, namely the Jarosite, the Goethite, and the Hematite Processes. Among them, it is the Jarosite Process that has dominated the scene. However jarosite residues tend to be voluminous (only 25% Fe content) and highly toxic due to incorporation of Zn, Cd, Pb, and other heavy metals, not to mention the relatively high Zn losses. The industry addresses the heavy metal release problem by further stabilizing jarosite prior to disposal as is done, for example, in the Jarofix Process. On the other hand, hematite residues produced by the Hematite Process have a very high iron content and low zinc losses but come with a relatively high operating cost. At present, commercial produced hematite residues are still considered a waste because of the impurities contained in them whereas the two major troublesome impurities are sulfur and zinc. Hematite technology may become more attractive if the produced hematite is clean enough to be used as a feed material for iron-steel making. In this paper, the practice of industrial hematite precipitation and the relevant technical literature are reviewed with the objective to identify the critical processing parameters which are responsible for the contamination of hematite with sulfur and zinc. The analysis is done from a crystallization theory standpoint. The role of supersaturation control or lack of it is emphasized in the analysis. Finally, the main elements of a research program focus ing on crystallization of hematite that is currently underway at McGill University will be outlined.

Aluminium hydroxide gels have been widely used in applications like sorbents and catalyst supports. Thermal treatment of aluminium hydroxide gels i.e., calcination and/or sintering, first leads to dehydration and then a series of phase changes. Once dehydration is complete several transition aluminium oxides namely <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> appear, and finally <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> Al2O3 is formed at about 1200&#176;C. In the current investigation boehmite (AIOOH) a bayerite (Al(OH)3) have been prepared in the presence of water-glycerol solutions. The results indicate that the precipitation media have considerable influence on the nature of aluminium hydroxide precipitate. Aluminium hydroxide gels thus prepared were characterised by TEM and XRD. Calcined powders were examined by XRD for phase content, by SEM for morphology and BET method for specific surface area. Calcination of aluminium hydroxide gels prepared by Hot water hydrolysis-Controlled precipitation technique yielded agglomerate free, spherical a Al2O3 powder.

CONTINUOUS BACTERIAL LEACHING OF A LOW-GRADE MANGANESE DIOXIDE ORE: </B> <I>S. Agatzini Leonardou, </I>J.G. Zafiratos, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece<P>
The leaching of a Greek low-grade manganese dioxide ore, not amenable to conventional mineral processing operations, was studied using a mixed culture of <I>Thiobacillus sp.</I> bacteria. The experiments were carried out in specially designed continuously aerated and stirred tank reactors arranged in two-tank series. The first tank of each series was loaded with an elemental sulfur culture suspension while the second was loaded with a manganese ore high density slurry. The bacterial culture had been previously adapted to grow on elemental sulphur and also in the presence of manganese ore and dissolved manganous ion. A two level full factorial design, was constructed in order to study the effects of the ferric ion concentration in the leach solution, the &quot;elemental sulphur weight to ore weight&quot; ratio, the ore pulp density and the composition of the dispersed gas. The responses which were investigated included percentage manganese recovery, co-dissolution of iron and manganese dissolution rate. Parameters with constant values throughout the experiment were the leach solution pH, the nutrient medium composition, the dilution rate and the ore and sulphur grain sizes. It was found that the ferric ion concentration was the most significant factor and had a positive effect on the final percentage extraction of manganese from the ore and also on the rate of manganese solubilisation from the ore. The effects of the other factors studied are discussed in detail.

Ni, Co &AMP; Cr RECOVERY FROM NICKEL LATERITE LEACH LIQUORS BY BIOSORPTION USING IMMOBILISED ALGAL BIO-MASS:</B> S. Agatzini-Leonardou, J.G. Zafiratos, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece<P>
The objective of this work was to prove repeated loading capacities of physically stabilized algal biomass from Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. for the removal and recovery of cobalt, nickel and chromium from laterite heap leach liquors. The testwork was carried out on a bench scale in small columns and proved that it is possible to immobilize the biomass on the highly porous surface of pumice stone. Nickel and cobalt could be removed from pure aqueous solutions of each metal by cyanobacterial biomass of the species Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. immobilized on the mineral. Nickel and also cobalt biosorption was sensitive to the initial solution pH. The maximum amount of cobalt was retained on the biomass at pH 6.0, while nickel was removed most effectively at pH 5.5. Repeated loading capacities of physically stabilized algal biomass from Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. were proven effective for the removal and recovery of cobalt and nickel from solutions resembling diluted laterite heap leach liquors. A lifetime of at least 5 loading cycles of the immobilized biosorbent material was obtained. The loading capacity of the immobilized biomass for nickel was comparatively lower than the capacity of the same biomass for cobalt. Cobalt recoveries up to 80% were achieved after 5 loading cycles under unoptimized conditions whereas nickel was removed completely (100%) under the same conditions. The described process might be applicable to recover cobalt from diluted laterite heap leach solutions.

A new technique is developed to overcome or minimize the inherent problems associated with aluminum RSW. Test results on 1 mm thick 6061 aluminum alloy sheets have shown that the new method can dramatically improve almost all of the problems encountered using conventional RSW. By using the new method, the following improvements have been achieved: 1) reducing/eliminating electrode contamination; 2) eliminating/minimizing surface indentation and deformation; 3) increased weld nugget size by 200% with same welding parameters; 4) maintaining consistent weld nugget size; and 5) no cleaning is needed, particularly at faying surfaces. Peeling strength is high and failure in peeling testing occurs in base metal around weld nugget. Metallographic investigation shows favorable oval nugget shape on cross section, which can improve weld nugget high peeling strength. The ratio of major axis to minor axis is 7 with major axis being 6.5 mm long. Weld nugget mechanical properties such as tension-shear strength is being evaluated and will be presented.

The utilization of aluminum alloys for lightweight automotive structures can be increased by improved formability and a reduction of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) problems associated with magnesium additions greater than about 3%. We have utilized a series of thermomechanical treatments on several 5xxx alloys (5052, 5082, 5083, 5454 and 5754) to alter the dispersoid density and size, as well as the distribution of eutectic constituents. The aim has been to optimize grain size for specific forming operations and post-formed properties. In addition, the role of the grain size and particle distribution, as well as the magnesium content and microstructure, on the SCC resistance has been investigated. It was found that the grain size could be controlled by the distribution of the dispersoid particles, with a minimum grain diameter of 8 &#181;m achieved in the 5083. The effect of grain size on SCC susceptibility was also evaluated.

APPLICATION OF THE METAL COMPRESSION FORMING PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AN ALUMINUM ALLOY COMPONENT: </B> R.M. Purgert, Precision Metal Forming Co., P.O. Box 25441, Garfield Heights, OH 44125; S. Viswanathan, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6083<P>
Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process also enhances the solidification rate of the metal promoting a very fine grain structure which results in improved properties. Consequently, the process is capable of producing parts with properties close to that of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process.

MICROSTRUCTURAL AND TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES EVALUATION OF CHAR-REINFORCED Al-Si ALLOY COMPOSITES</B>: J.U. Ejiofor, R.G. Reddy, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, P.O. Box 870202, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487

The application of carbon-reinforced aluminum composites in electromechanics has continued to attract new research investigations. The factors of interest range from low cost and availability of materials to low-temperature processing methods. This study has investigated the conventional double-compaction, powder metallurgy processing of Al-13.5Si-2.5Mg alloy (wt.%) reinforced with coconut shell chars. The mechanical, physical and relevant tribological properties were determined after achieving the optimum compaction and sintering conditions. Use of optical microscopy, EPMA, SEM and energy dispersive analysis were made in characterising the matrix-reinforcement interfaces, the fracture surfaces and the nature of the adhesive dry wear. At 0.02Vf of the char, the alloy exhibited properties suitable for antifriction applications. Increased additions of the chars resulted in largely reduced strength, hardness and sintered density. This is attributed to poor bonding of the char particles with the matrix alloy. Parallel investigations with palm-kernel shell char as the filler phase yielded identical results. Initial formation of A14C3 in the composites was detected at a sintering temperature of 600&#176;C. Reinforcement of the alloy with chars activated in CO2 to various bum-off percentages were found to yield marginal results.

The best use of anode carbon and bath materials withdrawn from the smelting process by anode changing involves their recycling. In order to provide optimal composition of recycled carbon and bath, a butt cleaning technology is required with the aim to avoid their contamination by each other. A technology and equipment has been elaborated for implementing above objective. Some optimization was fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the new aluminium smelter implemented by Hydro Aluminium technology, taking into account very tough requirements to the material quality, as well as fitting a piece of equipment into the technology flowsheet planned.

There are several dust control problems in the Aluminium industry, amongst them is the process of recycling anode butts. In general, prior to being recycled, the butts are cleaned, taken off the hexapod rods and stored and/or shipped to be processed as new anodes. A particular area of concern for fugitive dust during the anode preparation process is anode butt stripping inside the anode rodding room. This process generates a lot of carbon dust. It has been both a health and safety issue, as well as cleaning burden for operating personnel. This paper presents different alternatives, both mechanical and chemical, for controlling fugitive dust, and a decision process for using chemical treatment. In addition, the theory behind the chemical application and a case history will also be presented.

EFFICIENT ANODE-COLLAR CAST IRON MICROSTRUCTURE</B>: <I>Michael Barstow</I>, 1152 Southvale Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15237<P>
Cast iron is used to secure the steel stub of an anode rod to a carbon block for aluminum reduction cells. The quality is measured by the millivoltage drop across the stub-carbon interface. The electrical resistivity of cast iron varies with it's microstructure, which changes with temperature. Cast iron cannot be simply specified by analysis since it is section sensitive, and the microstructure is affected by minor elements, time, and rate of cooling. If the metallurgical control is limited, collars will develop variable electrical efficiencies. Recycling cast iron callors also causes a change inthe minor element analysis (S,P) which will change the microstructure / electrical resistivity. A cast iron designed for optimum fluidity with low level minor elements will provide lower electrical resistance than one with buildup of Mn, S. Other melting efficiencies are predicted.

AUTOMATIC STUB STRAIGHTENING SYSTEM:</B> <I>J&ograve;n Hjaltalin Magnusson, </I>ALTECH Ltd., Borgartun 18, 105 Reykjavik, Iceland; William Cannon, Portland Aluminium Ltd., Portland, Victoria 3305, Australia<P>
For improving the economy and environment aluminium smelters have increased the automation of diverse tasks. An automatic system has been developed for the task of straightening anode rod stubs instead of cutting them off the rod yoke and welding new onto the yoke. The stub toe-in problem cannot be eliminated, but significant degree of control can be implemented to eliminate its adverse effects and increase the useful life of the stubs and reduce the considerable cost of reparation and stub material. This paper describes the cause of the stub bending in the electrolitic cells together with the details of the new automatic stub straightening system based on preheating the stubs with induction heating coils prior to straightening in a hydraulic cylinder press. Implementation of this straightening system at Portland Aluminium in Australia is also described, where the system was installed in February 1996. The system is installed &quot;in-line&quot; in the P&amp;F overhead monorail and the bending of the stubs is measured automatically for deciding if the straightening is required or not. It will be shown how this system improves the useful life of the stubs leading to significant operational savings for the smelter.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE ANGULAR WIDENING OF A CAST PLATE</B>: J. Stetina, <I>F. Kavicka</I>, Technical University of Brno, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Technicka 2, 616 69 Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC; J.M. Khodadadi, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849-5341<P>
A 2-D numerical model was used to analyze the temperature field of a vertically cast 1700x600x40mm plate with different angles of widening in its cross section (0 to 4.4&#176;). From the side of the widening, the plate was either isolated (using Plastizol) or non-isolated. A non-isolated plate has an optimum angular widening of 3&#176; and the widening of 2&#176; lies on the boundary of the origins of internal defects (e.g. shrinkages). The isolated plate has an optimum angle of widening of 2&#176;. Using the calculations it is possible to predict that the plate itself will have the same internal quality with a widening of 3&#176; after crystallization without isolation as with 2&#176; of widening with the isolation. The knowledge gained in this study can lead to the reducing of the volume of liquid metal needed and to the lowering of costs for working the surface.

The production of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl foils by conventional ingot metallurgy involves casting ingots, hot forging ingots into billets, followed by several hot rolling, heat treatment, and surface grinding sequences. These methods, however, can result in production losses in excess of 50%. Recently, researchers at NASA-Langley and Ribtec have developed the Plasma Melt Overflow Process which combines plasma arc skull melting in a water cooled copper crucible with Melt Overflow Rapid Solidification Technology (MORST) allowing near-net-shape processing of strips that can be hot pack rolled to foil gauge with minimal production losses. Preliminary results indicate that foils produced via this method exhibit finer more uniform microstructures, higher strength, and higher ductility than comparable ingot metallurgy foils. In this investigation texture evolution has been evaluated in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys sheets produced via this technique. The results are compared with recent studies of texture in conventionally processed <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl.

LIQUID METAL-SOLID METAL REACTIONS WITH INTERMEDIATE INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND FORMATION:</B> <I>Robert J. Hanrahan Jr</I>., Dan J. Thoma, Loren A. Jacobson, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Materials Science Technology Division-MST-6, TA 3, MS G770, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
The study of liquid metal reactions have in most cases involved systems where the solid is dissolved by the liquid. The case where an intermetallic compound forms between the two metals has not been thoroughly investigated. As an example of this class of system we have chosen to study the reaction of Beryllium (solid)--with Rare Earths (liquid). Although most of the Be-RE phase diagrams are poorly defined in terms of solubility and the location of the eutectics, all have been characterized to the extent of having a single intermetallic compound with a melting point in excess of 1500&#176;C and two simple eutectics with minimal solubility range in the solid phases. The intermetallic in each case is the same structure, Mbe13. The reaction kinetics, measured using the thickness of the intermetallic layer at various times, can be described by a parabolic model suggesting that the reaction is controlled by diffusion through the intermetallic. Variations in kinetics are observed between the various systems which are analyzed considering factors such as melting point of the liquid (eutectic temperature), Be solubility in the liquid, and compositional range of the intermetallic.

The main driving forces for lightweight materials for the automotive industry and military applications are cost effectiveness, high-strength, and wear resistance. Precision Metal Forming Company (PMF) has developed a new and innovative squeeze casting process called metal compression forming (MCF). MCF integrates the deceptively simple concept of solidification of metal under direct pressure with closed die forging and low-pressure permanent-mold fill technologies. This hybrid process therefore combines the advantages of traditional direct squeeze casting and low-pressure permanent-mold casting.

KINETIC COMPETITION DURING DUPLEX PARTITIONLESS SOLIDIFICATION:</B> <I> Donald R. Allen, </I>John H. Perepezko, Dept. of Mat. Science and Eng., University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, WI 53706<P>
A structure composed of both partitionless face-centered cubic (fcc) and bodycentered cubic (bcc) phases has been observed following high undercooling solidification of nickel-vanadium (Ni-V) alloys for the composition range 4751.7 at.% V. Transmission electron microscopy analysis has identified regions in which fcc and bcc grains on the order of 100 nm in size coexist in a duplex structure. Splat-quenched foils were analyzed both in plan view and cross section. This structure has revealed a unique set of kinetic conditions that can allow for duplex solidification, since similar nucleation and growth rates are required for a range of compositions. A nucleation and growth kinetics analysis has been developed to describe the conditions under which this structure may form. The duplex partitionless structure previews an entirely new class of microstructures achievable during high undercooling solidification processing.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION IN Al-Cu-Si ALLOY MELT SPUN RIBBONS:</B> <I>K.-P. Cooper</I>, J D. Ayers, H.N. Jones, R. Vardiman, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6321, Washington, DC 20375-5343<P>
Several Al-Cu-Si alloys were melt spun to produce stable, fine grain microstructures that would be amenable to superplastic deformation and consolidation. Scanning electron microscopy of the ribbon cross-sections showed two distinct alternating microstructural morphologies suggesting transitions in solidification behavior. One consisted of intimately interlocked Al and A12Cu (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif">) phases with dispersed Si. The other consisted of equiaxed dendritic Al with inter-dendritic <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> and Si. The latter was found usually in the middle portion of the ribbon cross-section. The solidification mechanism for the interlocked structure is not understood, but its formation may have involved multiple nucleation of the phase or a degeneration of a more regular, but unknown, initial structure as the ribbon cooled to ambient temperature. The equiaxed dendritic structure probably arose as a result of independent nucleation events in the supercooled liquid ahead of the solid-liquid interface. Transmission electron microscopy revealed Al grain sizes varying from 1&#181;m near the wheelside to 8&#181;m with subgrains near the free surface and different shapes and sizes for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> and Si in the interlocked and dendritic regions.

HEAT TRANSFER AND SOLIDIFICATION IN UPCASTING OF COPPER:</B> K. Harkki, L. Holappa, Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Vuorimiehentie 2, FIN-02150 Espoo Finland<P>
An extensive study has been conducted to find out heat transfer and solidification behaviour in the copper upcasting mold. The casting direction in the upcasting process is vertically upwards and it has applications for copper and copper based alloys. The study combined industrial scale measurements, mathematical modeling and me/allographic examination of the cast rod samples. The industrial scale measurements involved temperature measurements with 14 thermocouples inserted in the copper jacket of the mold. Also temperature measurements of the cooling water were carried out. Axial heat flux profiles were determined quantitatively from the temperature measurements and they were used as boundary condition for the mathematical model calculations. The heat flux was observed to have a maximum value near the meniscus and to decrease rapidly with increasing distance up to the mold. Temperature profiles in the cast rod were simulated using a model based on finite element method. The results of the simulations were utilized for further understanding of the heat transfer and solidification process in the mold. Copper rod samples were examined to evaluate crystal growth of the cast copper rod. The results of the investigation work can be utilized to optimize the copper upcasting process.

Using a rate vacancy loss equation and an overall rate constant for order establishment, a model for describing the roles of quench temperature, quench rate and vacancy sink density is proposed. This model allows computation of the retained value of the first short-range order parameter of quenched binary alloys and the prediction that the most highly disordered state obtainable occurs with quenches from intermediate temperatures. Numerical results were tested against experimental data based on energetic analysis of differential scanning calorimetric traces pertaining to a reordering process towards the equilibrium state. Kinetic evaluations of these traces yield experimental estimates of quenched-in vacancy concentrations. Good agreement between modelled and experimental assessments was obtained in Cu at.% Zn alloy.

Metallic and non-metallic inclusions have long been recognized as one of the most important quality issues for aluminum can body alloys. Existence of the inclusions is often the cause of pinholes and high tear-off rate in the canmaking process. They also impose severe complications for alloy down-gauging. This paper presents the morphological aspects of the major inclusions commonly seen in AA3104 can stock alloy. The potential sources which may introduce inclusions in the alloy are also described. Some case studies are conducted to isolate the inclusions for characterization. The results can be utilized for understanding the mechanism of the inclusion formation and selection of proper materials in dealing with the molten alloy prior to ingot casting in order to minimize or eliminate the potential inclusion sources.

Spent rigid tube filter sections were examined following a number of alloy 3004 casts. Examination revealed the presence of the phases normally found in 3004 which formed during solidification, as well as the capture of salt, oxide and grain refiner particulate. Chemical and SEM analysis revealed that, for the most part, two mechanisms of filter blockage appear to be operative. In addition to filter cake buildup, on a portion of the tube, some of the 1-2 micron grain refiner particulate have reacted within the filter body forming coarser complexes.

DEPOSITION OF PARTICLES TO A BUBBLE:</B> Elin Haugland, Thorvald A. Engh, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Metallurgy, Alfred Getz Vei 2b, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway<P>
Experiments have been performed to study turbulent deposition of particles to a bubble. Water, containing particles, flowed down through a column. Bubbles were let into the column through a glass capillary tube in the lower part of the column, and then held at the capillary tube. The experiments were carried out with quartz particles in both clean distilled water and in water which amine was added. The bubble was allowed to rise into a collector tube. To determine the amount of particles collected by the bubble, the water/particle dispersion was filtered and the remaining mass was weighted. Velocities and turbulence were measured by laser doppler velocimetry. Particle-bubble collisions were studied with a high-speed videocamera. The results indicate that particle collection on the bubbles reaches saturation. The particles seem to have a certain residence time at the bubble surface, before they leave the bubble.

Experimental results indicate that turbulence may enhance the flotation rate of non-metallic inclusions to bubbles significantly. In this paper possible flow phenomena responsible for such effects are investigated. We recognize that the turbulent flow consists of a spectrum of eddy sizes. The eddies larger than the bubble diameter can only displace the bubble. Only the smaller eddies contribute to an enhanced turbulent deposition of inclusions. The turbulent flow over single bubbles are computed and the turbulent trajectories of inclusions approaching the bubbles are calculated. The resulting collection efficiencies are discussed and compared to available experimental results.

Electromagnetic filtration is an emerging technology for purification of molten metals. This particle separation method relies on the huge difference in the electrical conductivity of the metal and non-metallic inclusions to drive the motion of the under an applied force field. The principle of electromagnetic separation will be briefly reviewed together with methods of generating a force field in molten metals. Also described is an induced current separator for the removal of non-metallic inclusions from molten aluminum. The key feature of this system is that the force field has no stirring component, which is necessary to prevent particle entrapment within flow eddies. The system was used to investigate the kinetics of inclusion removal from molten aluminum using 100 and 200&#181; size particles at low applied magnetic field of 0.015 T. The results show complete removal of these inclusion particles under these conditions and particle migration in the melt occurs in a direction opposite to the force field, as predicted by the theory. Analytical expression was developed to predict the rate of inclusion removal in induced current systems. The experimentally determined rate was found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The scale-up of the system for industrial applications will be discussed.

In order to examine the consistency of metal quality with respect to oxide inclusions, salts and intermetallic particles, filter samples were taken randomly from the casting chamber during normal production of pure magnesium at Norsk Hydro Canada in 1995. The contents of oxide particles, oxide films, salts and intermetallic particles were measured by optical microscopy and image analysis of the sliced and polished filter samples. The results indicate that the contents of oxide particles, oxide films, salts and intermetallic particles are low and consistent; normally well below 1 mm3/kg for all types of inclusions. Oxide inclusions and intermetallic particles are usually smaller than 50 &#181;m and 20 &#181;m, respectively. The filter sampling method and analysis technique used in the quantitative microscopy are discussed in some detail, emphasising advantages and drawbacks. The impact of the most common inclusions in pure magnesium on aluminium alloy quality is discussed from a thermodynamic point of view.

To obtain high quality ingots, the generation of inclusions must be prevented during the various stages of liquid metal manipulation. In an attempt to understand the nature of oxide film generation, the oxidation behaviour of Al-Mg melts with different Mg contents of 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% were studied in air, argon and carbon dioxide. Moreover, the effects of agitation and temperature on the nature of melt surface oxide films were investigated. For each condition, the growth process and the morphology of the surface oxide films behaved differently. In addition, this study used the Liquid Metal Cleanliness Analyzer (LiMCA) and Porous Disk Filtration Apparatus (PoDFA) to investigate the effect of melt agitation and Mg content on the melt inclusion content. The results indicate that agitation and magnesium increase both the melt inclusion content and the average inclusion size. In addition, the oxide film removal from the surface of the melt affects the melt oxidation behaviour significantly.

MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BULK NANOSTRUCTURED Fe/Cu ALLOYS:</B> <I>Walter W. Milligan</I>, John E. Carsley, Stephen A. Hackney, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Elias C. Aifantis, Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931<P>
The mechanical behavior of bulk iron alloys containing 10% copper was investigated. Grain sizes were varied by processing, and ranged from 45 nm to 900 nm. Deformation in all cases occurred by intense localized shear banding as the first and only mechanism of plastic deformation, from the yield point until fracture or buckling. Mechanical response was elastic-perfectly plastic. Shear band angles and an asymmetry of the yield strength in tension and compression both indicated the possibility of a pressure-sensitive yield criterion. Continuum models based on this approach proved promising. Shear band widths increased with microstructural coarseness, and were correlated successfully with a gradient plasticity approach. A number of similarities between the behavior of these alloys and amorphous materials such as metallic glasses and amorphous polymers will be discussed.

DEFORMATION MECHANISMS IN METALLIC NANOLAMINATES</B>: <I>Tim Foecke</I>, Metallurgy Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001<P>
It has been seen that the introduction of a nanolayered microstructure can increase the yield strength and hardness of a material to many times that of a conventional microstructure. The deformation mechanisms that operate (or fail to operate) at such a small length scale is not understood and is only beginning to be investigated. An in situ TEM deformation experiment has revealed a dislocation generation mechanism that operates in Cu/Ni single crystal nanolaminates. Dislocation loops nucleated at several locations within a Ni layer at the Cu/Ni interface, and were seen to expand until they intersected the next interface. Two Orowan bows were then seen to expand in opposite directions along the layer. Discussion will include possible nucleation sites and thin film artifacts, as well as presentation of other TEM observations of fracture and deformation in metallic nanolaminates.

DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF HIGH-STRENGTH Al94(V2,Ti)4Fe2 ALLOYS CONSISTING OF NANOGRANULAR AMORPHOUS AND Al PHASES:</B> <I> Akihisa Inoue</I>, Hisamichi Kimura and Kenichiro Sasamori, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-77, Japan<P>
A new mixed structure consisting of nanogranular amorphous and fcc-Al phases was formed in melt-spun Al94V4Fe2 and Al94V2Ti2Fe2 alloys and the complete replacement of V by Ti causes the change into a mixed structure of nanogranular Al phase surrounded by an amorphous phase. The structural change appears to result from the difference in solidification processes, i.e., the formation of the amorphous phase as a primary phase, followed by the Al phase for the V-containing alloys and the primary formation of the Al phases and then the amorphous phase for the V-free alloy. The former type is a unique process which is observed in the limited alloys containing V with icosahedral-forming ability and low diffusivity. The coexistence of the nanogranular amorphous phase is expected to affect significantly the mechanical strength, deformation behavior and fracture mode. These mixed phase alloys have good bending ductility and exhibit high tensile strength of 1390 MPa for Al94V4Fe2, 1370 MPa for Al94V2Ti2Fe2 and 1320 MPa for Al94Ti4Fe2 at room temperature. The fracture mode is analogous to that for amorphous alloys. At the meeting, we will report the detailed results on the temperature dependence of mechanical strength, deformation behavior and fracture mode for the nanogranular amorphous alloys.

FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF NANOCRYSTALLINE AND ULTRAFINE-GRAINED Cu:</B> <I>S.R. Agnew</I>1, R.Z. Valiev2, J.R. Weertman1, 1Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, 2Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ufa, Russia<P>
One of the tests that can give insight into the deformation mechanisms of nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained metals is fatigue. In the past, we investigated the microstructural stability of nanocrystalline (~20nm) Cu under cyclic loading. We observed good stability of the microstructure using XRD. An SEM study revealed extrusions on the surface, similar to those of persistent slip bands, oriented in the direction of maximum shear. The presence of extrusions suggests deformation by a shearing process. To augment our understanding of this phenomenon, we have begun studying the fatigue behavior of UFG Cu with a grain size of about 200nm. There we have observed similar extrusions as in the previous study. We are investigating the microstructural stability of this metal using the TEM. We will discuss our experimental results and their contribution to our understanding of the deformation mechanisms operative in pure FCC metals with ultra-fine microstructures.

COHERENT SOLUBILITY LIMITS OF <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">'-TYPE PHASES IN FOUR BINARY Ni-BASE ALLOYS:</B> <I>F. Li</I> and A.J. Ardell, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1595
<P>
The equilibrium solubilities of coherent phases can be affected by the initial solute concentration of the alloy, Xo. This differs completely from incoherent equilibrium, wherein the solubility limits are independent of Xo. To investigate the relationship between coherent equilibrium solubility and Xo, Ni-Al, Ni-Ga, Ni-Ge and Ni-Ti alloys, each with several different values of Xo, were prepared by arc melting, rolling into sheet, solution, treating, and aging for times up to 1632h at 500&#176;C. The variation of solute concentration in the Ni-rich matrix, X, with aging time, t, was followed using measurements of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature. The equilibrium solubilities, Xeq, were estimated by plotting the data as X vs. t-1/3 and extrapolating to t-1/3=0 (t=<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/infinity.gif">), thus presupposing that coarsening of the expected <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">'-type phases in all four alloys is responsible for the variation of X. Xeq is unequivocally dependent on Xo, but whereas Xeq in the Ni-Al, Ni-Ga and Ni-Ti alloys increases with increasing Xo as predicted theoretically by Ardell and Maheshwari, Xeq in the Ni-Ge alloy system decreases. TEM is currently in progress to confirm the identity and state of coherency of the precipitate phases present. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation

The effect of composition wavelength (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif">) on the structure, electrical resistivities and mechanical properties of Cu/Nb nanolayered composites were evaluated. The as- sputtered multilayers, with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif"> varying between 25&Aring; and 1000&Aring;, exhibit a strong Kurjudmov-Sachs orientation relationship between the close packed planes and directions of the fcc Cu and bcc Nb: &lt;110&gt;{111}Cu//&lt;111&gt;{l10}Nb. As ~decreases to 11&Aring;, the entire multilayer shows bcc structure. The Cu grows pseudomorphically on the bcc Nb which acts as a template for the normally fcc Cu. The layers are heavily strained and there is a high density of dislocations present. As <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif"> increases from 11&Aring; to 25&Aring;, it is suspected that there is enough loss of coherency to transform bcc Cu martensitically to fcc Cu. The mechanical and electrical properties of nanolayered Cu/Nb composites with Cu in either fcc or bcc structure will be reported.

Surface mount technology (SMT) has been practiced as the principal soldering method for the assembly of printed circuit boards (PCB) last ten years. SMT packages connected by solder joints occupy more than two thirds of a PCB real estate. SMT packages consist of both conventional formats such as small outline package (SOP), small outline 'J' leads (SOJ), plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCC), or quad flatpack (QFP), and fairly new packages such as thin small outline package (TSOP), tape carrier package (TCP), chip-on-board (COB), ball grid array (BGA), and many more. In this talk, recent developments of SMT soldering technologies are briefly reviewed, followed by discussion of several technical issues affecting the reliability of SMT solder joints. The subject matters to be discussed include solder joint defects, microstructure, interfacial reactions, thermal fatigue, and Pb-free solders.

RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN CHOOSING WATER SOLUBLE FLUX FOR ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY:</B> <I>Laura Turbini</I>, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Materials Science and Engineering, 778 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA 30332
<P>
There is a need for a fundamental understanding of the interaction of processing chemicals such as fusing fluids, soldering fluxes and cleaning agents with printed wiring board substrates. This need is driven by two factors: (1) the increased density of today's electronic products creates voltage gradients which are high enough to enhance degradation modes which are not important for less dense circuitry, and (2) the elimination of chlorofluocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone depleting cleaning agents due to their destructive effect on the stratospheric ozone layer has lead to a proliferation of new soldering fluxes and cleaning agents whose interactions with the printed wiring board (PWB) are not well characterized. Water soluble fluxes have been effectively used in high volume electronic manufacturing operations for a number of years. Their use has increased dramatically as they provided an opportunity to eliminate CFCs in the cleaning process. They provide excellent soldering with low defect levels and with a proper cleaning process can produce highly reliable electronic circuits. However, some water flux and fusing fluid formulations contain ingredients which can have deleterious effects on the reliability of a product under certain operating and use conditions. There is a failure mechanism known as conductive anodic filament formation (CAF) which has been observed in PWBs boards treated with certain water soluble fluxes. This failure mode involves a debonding of the epoxy-glass interface and the formation of a conductive filament which grows along this interface from anode to cathode. This paper will report on those chemicals which tend to enhance this failure mode and will make recommendations on assuring the reliability of electronic assemblies.

INFLUENCE OF COMPONENT SOLDERABILITY ON RELIABILITY OF SOLDER JOINTS:</B> <I>Colin Lea</I>, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 0LW, UK<P>
The commonest mode of service failure of solder joints on circuit board electronics assemblies is low-cycle fatigue cracking from differential expansion during power-up and power-down of the equipment. The resistance of a solder joint interconnection to fatigue cracking is governed by both its microstructure and its geometry. In turn, these are both governed by the soldering process and the manner in which the molten solder wets and flows on the component metallisation; the component's solderability. Data will be presented, for surface mount assemblies, that relate component/circuit board solderability to solder fillet shape, and in turn to solder joint reliability. The best fillet geometry varies markedly between the many different styles and compositions of metallisation found on surface mounting components. Furthermore, the pass/fail criteria of solderability measurements are not necessarily related to the required solder fillet geometry for best reliability. Both infra-red reflow and wave soldering have been used, since the use of solderability on solder fillet shape may be quite different for the different manufacturing routes.

As a part of a program supported at AT&amp;T Network Systems for continuous improvement in solderability, solderability modeling, and solderability specifications, an assembly trial was performed to determine the correlation of assembly yield to different combinations of solder volume, component coplanarity, component aging, and solder alloy. Through the use of wetting balance data and assembly yield statistics, soldering process charts correlating assembly yield to solder volume and coplanarity show that severe lead surface finish degradation would require (unmanufacturable) component coplanarities of less than 1 mil to maintain 100% assembly yield. The 132 I/O, 25 mil pitch, BQFPs were pre-conditioned using high temperature and humidity to degrade lead surface finish. Standard tin-lead solder and three commercially available lead-free solders were used to vary the solder wetting characteristics. To determine a process window for solderability, solder volume was varied by using two different stencil thicknesses, and coplanarity was measured to determine the effect of mechanical tolerance. Electrical continuity and visual inspection showed that assembly yield decreased with decreasing solder volume, poorer mechanical tolerance, and increased component aging time. Wetting balance data showed trends for aging conditions, but a correlation to coplanarity was not found. Contact angle results indicate that tin-lead had best wetting properties however this conflicts with assembly trial results where tin-lead had the higher failure level than the lead-free alloys. The goals of this project were: to further define a process window for solderability with tolerances for volume and coplanarity distributions; (2) to refine solderability specifications; and (3) to verify a computer model used to assess solder joint geometry and joint quality based on solder alloy and component lead properties. Assembly yield was examined based on different combinations of solder volume, component coplanarity, component aging, and solder alloy.

Low cycle solder joint fatigue analysis is an important aspect of assessing the package to board solder interconnection performance of circuit card assemblies. A simple analysis tool that takes into account the significant environmental conditions for storage, operation, transportation, etc., and calculates the number of cycles to failure for a given set of input parameters is described. These parameters include coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of individual elements of the assembly structures, temperature, duration, number and frequency of cycles. Both leadless and leaded component configurations are included in the design of this tool. Lead stiffness for leaded components are calculated using equations published in the literature.

QUALIFICATION OF BALL GRID ARRAY ASSEMBLIES FOR SPACE FLIGHT APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Sharon Walton</I>, Kirk Bonner, Electronic Packaging and Fabrication Section, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109
<P>
JPL, in a partnership with an industrial consortium, is engaged in the investigation of reliability and quality issues of Ball Grid Array Packages as they may be applied to space flight electronics. Performing tests to determine the solder joint reliability of assemblies using BGAs under temperature cycling is proving to be a real challenge for test engineers. It was recognized early in the program that a large number of the BGA solder joints would be under test simultaneously and that some sort of computer based assistance would be required to accurately track the failures and the time at which they occurred. JPL has been using the National Instrument LabVIEW software and SCXI hardware to set up our system. The data acquisition program, DAQ.VI, was written around LabVIEW, a graphics based operating system. The program controls the temperature chambers, gathers data from the interface cards, logs data, and provides operator interface. This system can monitor over 1500 channels for electrical continuity and 32 channels for temperature. This software/hardware system greatly simplifies the task of monitoring and tracking failures and the conditions when the failures occurred of a large number of solder joint channels through the automatic gathering and recording of the test results onto a personal computer data base.

Chip-scale packages (CSP) are miniaturized IC packages that are being developed for applications ranging from memory chips to advanced high-performance processors. Adaptable to volume manufacturing, this type of package offers the performance and size advantages of a bare die, while conforming to the established infrastructure for electronic assembly. Tessera's &#181;BGA belongs to this new family of CSP, wherein the need to underfill the device has been eliminated. The reliability of solder joints in Tessera's &#181;BGA package is presented. Modeling studies on solder joint integrity have been conducted via finite element analysis (FEA) to predict stress and strain distributions at the solder ball-joint interfaces and potential failure points. The modeling work is complimented by studies involving ball shear testing and, intermetallic growth via optical/SEM/EDAX techniques following long time static annealing and temperature cycling. These reliability studies are suggestive that Tessera's &#181;BGAs are robust packages.

Constant-load creep and stress relaxation tests of Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy were performed at high homologous temperatures from 25&#176;C to 180&#176;C. Single lap shear tests were conducted on joined flip chip packages with 33X33 area array of Sn-3.5Ag solder bumps. Tensile creep tests were performed on bulk solder specimens. The steady-state strain-rates span 7 orders of magnitude ranging from 10-9 to 10-12 (1/s). The apparent activation energy of creep was found to be 0.57 ev. The stress exponent (n) in the power-law creep equation is found to be about 10 which is unusually high compared to that for many other metals. A constitutive equation relating stress, temperature and strain-rate for Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy was established. Low-temperature dislocation-climb deformation mechanism (with dislocation-pipe diffusion) is believed to be dominant in the medium-to-high stress region with power-law breakdown at very high stresses. Numerical simulations of a flip chip package were performed to characterize the failure modes. The effects of different design parameters were studied with regard to strain accumulation and stress distribution in the package under thermal cycles. Recommendations are made for design optimization. This work has been supported by the Microelectronic Center of North Carolina.

SPONTANEOUS COMPOSITION MODULATION IN SEMICONDUCTOR ALLOYS</B>: <I>Joanna Mirecki Millunchick</I>, Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM 87195-0601<P>
Lateral composition modulation (CM) has been observed to occur spontaneously in III-V semiconductors, producing quantum wires. CM is presumed to originate from surface undulations arising from compositional inhomogeneity, as well as lattice mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate. We observe CM in homogeneous alloys or in short period superlattices. Samples were characterized using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM), polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy (PPL), reflection difference spectroscopy (RDS), and magneto-luminescence (ML). For example, XTEM micrographs of InAs/GaAs superlattices show contrast due to CM only in the projection, with a period 150&Aring;. PL measurements show that emission is red-shifted and polarized with a ratio of up to 4. InAlAs buffer layers, on the other hand, have much higher polarization ratios (up to 10), indicating that these films may also be compositionally modulated. XTEM images of nominally lattice-matched InxGa1-xAs / InxAl1-xAs superlattice structures grown on InP (001) show that only the InAlAs layers exhibit contrast due to CM along the direction, in agreement with polarized PL results. The modulation period for such a structure deposited at Ts=475&#176;C, for example, is 50&Aring;. Preliminary temperature-dependent PL and ML results for InAlAs epilayers show that the emission is independent of T and B, suggesting carrier confinement due CM. These phenomena are under investigation in an effort to determine the dependence of the material system on CM. Finally, a model of the effect of CM on the band structure will be discussed.

Microstructural evolution of the InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures grown by MBE at low temperatures (200-250&#176;C) has been studied using double crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Dislocation formation was suppressed at low growth temperatures, and the layers sustained metastable structures which would undergo microstructural change at high temperatures. Misfit dislocations formed at InGaAs/GaAs interfacial region during annealing relieved accumulated strain caused by lattice mismatch between the InGaAs and GaAs. Arsenic precipitates formed during the annealing process also played an important role for strain relaxation by forming misfit dislocations along matrix/As interface. Structural stability of the low temperature grown layers in discussed in terms of the microstructural evolution observed at various growth and annealing temperatures.

REDUCTION OF PRIMARY CREEP IN TiAl ALLOYS BY PRESTRAINING:</B> <I>Jian N. Wang</I>, L.M. Hsiung, T.G. Nieh, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, L-370, P.O. Box 808, Livermore, CA 94551-9900<P>
In some engineering applications, TiAl components are limited to undergo less than 0.3-0.5% creep distortion. However, existing fully lamellar TiAl alloys deform to this strain within a short period of time during primary creep. Thus, the reduction of primary creep has become a key issue. Present experiments show that this creep can be significantly reduced by prestraining. A sample prestrained at a high stress could undergo no forward deformation at a subsequent low stress even after a long period of time. Microstructural examination indicates that the motion of misfit dislocations along interfacial and thermal twin boundaries is the dominant mode of deformation at low stress. The mobility of these dislocations after prestraining and the physical origin of this effect will be discussed.

CHANGES IN MICROSTRUCTURE DURING PRIMARY CREEP IN A Ti-47Al-2Nb-1Mn-0.5W-0.5Mo-0.2Si ALLOY:</B> <I>D.Y. Seo</I>, T.R. Bieler, Department of Materials Science and Mechanics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1226; D.E. Larsen, Howmet Corporation, Whitehall, MI 49461<P>
Cast gamma titanium aluminides are gaining acceptance as potential replacements for superalloy and steel components in many applications. One particular alloy with W, Mo and Si additions has shown exceptional primary creep resistance. Quantitative microscopic comparisons were made between microstructures in the grip sections and the deformed gage section in creep specimens deformed to 0.5% strain, using optical, SEM and TEM techniques. The lamellar spacing in lamellar grains systematically decreased after creep deformation. Precipitates containing refractory elements nucleated and grew at a faster rate in the deformed part of the specimen, as compared to the deformed region, and the precipitates were generally smaller and more homogeneously nucleated. Precipitates have been identified to be silicides or beta phase. These observations indicate that strain assisted nucleation of precipitates accounts for much of the excellent creep resistance.

EVOLUTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE DURING THE ELEVATED TEMPERATURE CREEP OF SINGLE-PHASE GAMMA Ti47Al51Mn2 ALLOY:</B> <I>Min Lu,</I> Kevin J. Hemker, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218
<P>
Mechanical experiments have shown that single-phase gamma TiAl does not exhibit steady-state creep. Instead, the microstructure evolves along the creep curves. To investigate microstructure/property relations, constant stress creep tests on single-phase polycrystalline gamma Ti47Al51Mn2 were conducted at temperatures below and above the peak temperature (600&#176;C). Primary creep, minimum strain rate regions and tertiary creep were investigated. Creep tests conducted at 550&#176;C, 550&#176;C and 700&#176;C were stopped at different stages and specimens were prepared for TEM observations. No evidence of the subgrain formation has been found in any of the creep tests. Faulted dipoles and superdislocations, as well as a few ordinary dislocations, were present in the microstructure of the early stage of the creep tests. At longer creep times, faulted dipoles were annihilated and superdislocations were found to form &quot;roof&quot; like barriers. TEM observations of faulted dipoles and superdislocations were correlated, where appropriate, with computer simulations. The density and the degree of bowing of the &quot;cusps&quot; on ordinary dislocations increased dramatically with increasing creep strain. The configuration of the &quot;cusps&quot; formed on the ordinary dislocations were studied with weak-beam TEM and were compared to those found in the yielding and the prestraining studies of the same alloy.

MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND CREEP DEFORMATION OF A MO-CONTAINING NEAR-GAMMA ALLOY:</B> <I>Eric Ott</I>, Tresa Pollack, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213<P>
The addition of Mo in near-gamma alloys promotes the formation of the beta phase. The presence of the beta phase stabilized by Mo as well as other alloy additions including Nb and Cr has been shown to result in good hot working characteristics. Microstructural evolution of a Ti-46.4Al-2Nb-2Cr-0.8Mo fine grained wrought alloy during annealing and subsequent heat treatment will be reported with a specific emphasis on the effects of the beta/B2 phases on the development of gamma and lamellar microstructures. Results of creep testing and subsequent microscopy of near-gamma and duplex microstructures will also be discussed and compared to that of a similar Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr type alloy containing no Mo.

CREEP DEFORMATION OF NEAR/FULLY LAMELLAR Ti-48Al-BASED ALLOYS:</B> <I>G.B. Viswanathan, </I>V.K. Vasudevan, Dept. of Mat. Sci. &amp;Eng., Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221<P>
In this study, the creep properties of the binary Ti-48Al and quarternary Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloys are investigated for the near and fully lamellar microstrutures in the temperature range of 700-815&#176;C and stress of 103-240 MPa. The creep behavior of all the tested microstructures is best described by the power law creep. Activation energy (Q) between 350-370 KJ/mole and stress exponent (n) in the range of 5.0-8.0 was obtained for the binary Ti-48Al alloy. The corresponding values for the Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy were ~315 KJ/mole and ~5.0. The effect of grain size and the lamellar spacing on the creep behavior is discussed. Defect analysis through weak beam dark field imaging was carried out to elucidate the dislocation mechanisms in the crept samples. Observations of the crept samples with the fully lamellar structure in the binary alloy indicate that both 1/2&lt;110] and 1/2&lt;112] dislocations are active, that the deformation is highly anisotropic and that the lamellar interfaces obstruct slip (depending on the orientation). The combination of low creep rates with a high stress exponent for the fully lamellar structures is thought to be caused by the combined effect of anisotropic deformation and lamellar boundaries obstructing slip; the dislocations that are piled up at the interfaces overcome these obstacles by local climb, which is reflected in the Q values near that of self-diffusion of Ti in TiAl. The formation of substructures within the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths and the lamellar interface structures before and after creep will be discussed.

A two-phase <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> (TiAl) + Laves (Ti[Cr,Al]2) oxidation-resistant coating alloy, Ti-51.25Al-12.25Cr at.%, has been developed for the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 class of titanium aluminides. The composition of the coating alloy was selected so that the microstructure consists of the g phase, and a minor volume fraction of the oxidation-resistant Laves phase. By basing the microstructure on the g phase, the mechanical properties and substrate compatibility are optimized. The volume fraction of the Laves phase is kept to a minimum because it is extremely brittle.

VERY LONG TERM OXIDATION OF Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb AT 704&#176;C IN AIR:</B> <I>I.E. Locci</I>, M.P. Brady, R.A. MacKay, J.W. Smith; MS106-5, NASA Lewis, Cleveland, OH 44135<P>
The alloy Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb was exposed from 500h to 9000h at 704&#176;C in air. A complex, mixed alumina/titania scale, rather than a protective alumina scale, was formed. After 9000h, this scale was approximately 15 microns thick. A continuous Ti-rich nitride layer was formed at the alloy/scale interface. The alloy ahead of this nitride layer was depleted in Ti and enriched in Al. Comparisons with the oxidation behavior of binary TiAl alloys, and implications of the scale microstructure for mechanical properties will be discussed.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON THE OXIDATION OF TiAl:</B> <I>R. Wheeler</I>, R. Banerjee, H.L. Fraser, Department of Mater. Sci. and Eng., Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210<P>
The high level of Al in TiAl based alloys does not always relate to slow oxidation kinetics. While protective alumina scales are formed during high temperature exposures in an oxygen environment, mixed Al2O3/TiO2 scales are formed when similar tests are conducted in air. In this latter case, the surface corrosion products form a complex layered structure which governs oxidation rates. In a Ti-48Al-2Cr (at.%) alloy oxidized in air at 800&#176;C for 1 hour, two distinct layered microstructures are observed. One is composed of an Al depleted underlayer and a mixed Al2O3/TiO2 outerlayer. The other is composed of the same depleted layer with a multicomponent, multilayered outerscale. This second microstructure is characteristic of a nitrogen effect found to be associated with increased oxidation kinetics. Detailed TEM analyses has been conducted to identify the reaction products present in the scale. The deduced reaction paths suggest a rate behavior based on both interfacial reactions and the inward and outward anion and cation diffusion.

We conducted comparative investigation to determine the effects of temperature and oxygen pressure on the oxidation behavior and microstructure of V-4wt.% Cr-4wt.% Ti and V-5wt.% Cr-5wt.% Ti Alloys. The samples were cut from 1-mm-thick cold-rolled sheet stock and annealed at 1050&#176;C for 1 h before their use in oxidation studies. The oxidation experiments were performed at oxygen pressures of 760, 0.1, 5x10-4, and 5x10-6 torr and at temperatures of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif">350 to 700&#176;C. Oxidation models, oxide type and thickness, partitioning of oxygen between oxide and substrate alloy, and alloy grain size were determined as a function of temperature and oxygen pressure. The results for the two alloys are discussed and compared with one another and with those from similar studies on unalloyed V reported in the literature.

SUPERHEATING BEHAVIOR OF NiAl:</B> <I> N. Kullcarni</I>, Dept. of Materials Science &amp; Eng., University of Florida, 245 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, Fl-32611; K.T. Hong, Division of Metals, Korea Inst. of Science &amp; Tech (KIST), 39-1 Hawolkog-dong, Sungbook-Gu, Seoul, Korea 136-791<P>
The intermetallic compound NiAl, when processed in a microgravity environment under electromagnetic levitation, exhibited a unique superheating effect up to 65 degrees over the melting point. This superheating behavior appeared to be related to the high supercoolings (200-250 degrees) experienced by molten NiA1 samples that rapidly solidified in the rnicrogravity levitation environment. The superheating observed appeared to be permanent and reduced asymmetrically for compositions that deviated from stoichiometry. On reaching the maximum or critical superheating temperature, an anomalous transformation occurred that caused the temperature of the sample to drop to its melting point, after which melting commenced. It appears that this transformation is an order-disorder type, that is explicitly associated with the superheating behavior in NiAl.

A STUDY OF POTENIAL EUTECTIC BRAZE ALLOYS IN THE Au-Ag-Ge TERNARY SYSTEM: </B> P.T. Vianco, <I>J.J. Stephens</I>, C.A. Walker, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0367<P>
Despite the need for low vapor pressure alloys with brazing temperatures in the 400-600&#176;C range, there are in fact very few commercially available alloys to use in this range. This study was motivated by the need to develop a brazing process with a maximum allowable brazing temperature of 500&#176;C. A survey of ternary phase diagrams, combined with previous experience with the binary 88wt.% Au-12 Ge alloy, led us to select the Au-Ag-Ge ternary system for further study. We have found that the 77.32 wt.% Au-12.62 Ag-10.06 Ge composition is a eutectic alloy with a eutectic temperature of ~447&#176;C. Hermetic seals to metallized alumina tensile buttons (ASTM F19 design) have been obtained with this system. This talk will present results braze joints strength results, along with a discussion of the as-solidified microstructure of this alloy.

DEGASSING LIQUID ALUMINUM ALLOYS BY ARGON IN CLOSED CIRCUIT</B>: Robert A. Rapp, L.S. Fan, Ohio State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, 116 W. 19th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The large reduction in the solubility of dissolved hydrogen in aluminum as it is solidified to form ingots, strip, sheet or cast products necessitates that the liquid metal is degassed prior to casting. Pure argon is frequently injected into the liquid alloy through a submerged lance or bubbler, so that dissolved hydrogen enters the argon bubble prior to discharge into the environment. This work introduces a proprietary concept to achieve the same argon degassing of liquid aluminum alloys, with recirculation of the argon in a closed loop such that the cost of the argon is saved. In practice, the hydrogen entrained by the argon from the liquid alloy would be oxidized to form H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) by reaction with a fixed bed of copper oxide pellets and the H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) product would be extracted by a desiccator bed. When the reactant bed of copper oxide is mostly reduced to copper and the desiccator approaches saturation, a relay is activated, causing a redirection of the gas flow which replaces the spent reactants with newly regenerated ones.

CLOSED-LOOP NITROGEN-CHLORINE DEGASSING/FLUXING OF LIQUID ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> L.S. Fan, Robert A. Rapp, Ohio State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, 116 W. 19th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The need to degas liquid aluminum alloys to reduce dissolved hydrogen prior to solidification to form any product is indigenous to all aluminum processing plants. Likewise, to produce aluminum sheet and some other products, dissolved sodium and calcium must be fluxed by reaction with chlorine. Today, the combined degassing and fluxing is often achieved by the bubbling of a nitrogen-chlorine gas mixture into the melt, with release of the product HCl and unreacted Cl2 into the environment. This work introduces a proprietary concept to accomplish the degassing/fluxing of aluminum melts by the usual nitrogen-chlorine gas mixture, but with recirculation of the chlorine within a closed-loop system so that it is not released to the environment. Reaction of HCl and Cl2 from the degassing product gases with copper oxide pellets in a fixed bed lead to their conversion to copper chlorides, and the H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) product is safely vented to the environment. Ambient air is used to regenerate the reactant copper oxide from the product copper chloride.

The proposed disposal process provides an energy efficient mechanism for recovering salts from the pot-lining and disposing of the carbonaceous liner itself. The proposed method is to grind the spent pot-liner into small particles and then oxidize them. The method which appears most likely to be successful is to grind to about 1 mm diameter, heat to about 1300 K in an &quot;inert&quot; atmosphere of CO2, and then react with steam.

RHENIUM AND IRIDIUM:</B> Evan K. Ohriner, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6083<P>
Rhenium is used together with the metal iridium in a number of applications. Iridium has been used as coating for rhenium rocket thrusters and as an oxidation-resistant coating in a number of other applications. The high strength of rhenium at elevated temperature is combined with the oxidation resistance and high melting point of iridium. The use of the two metals together is advantageous due to the absence of any stable intermediate compounds. Coating life and properties are effected by solubility and diffusion rates. Rhenium and iridium alloying additions both improve the ductility of tungsten. The high solubility of rhenium in iridium is also being taken advantage of to produce iridium-based materials with a reduced electron work function. The uses of rhenium in conjunction with iridium are discussed. Managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research under contract DE-AC05-96OR22464 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

The method of deposition of thin rhenium layers on inner wall of teflon pipes (tubes) by means of filling the pipes by volatile rhenium compound and subsequent chemical reduction of this compound inside teflon pores was developed. The method allows to diminish permeability of teflon for gases or liquids and to change its electric properties: the inner layer becomes electroconductive. Such teflon pipes and details are necessary for neutralization of static electric charges in some devices. The depth of metallized layer, as it was shown by microscopic examination of pipe cross sections, did not exceed some tenth of millimeter. The method allows to deposit -metallized layers of definite configuration.

DEVELOPMENT OF A METALLIC RADIOACTIVE RHENIUM SOURCE FOR THE TREATMENT OF RESTENOSIS AFTER ANGIOPLASTY:</B> Urs Hafeli, Eric Lee, Jay Ciezki, Roger Macklis, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Desk T28, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195<P>
Radioactive Rhenium sources can be prepared in a nuclear reactor by bombarding the non-radioactive metal with neutrons. In a n, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-reaction, the two <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/beta.gif">-emitters 186Re and 188Re are produced with high yield. One application of thus prepared radioactive Rhenium wires is the prevention and treatment of restenosis after balloon angioplasty. For this brachytherapeutic application, the source must be very stable, enclosed and safe to handle. The necessary encapsulation of the radioactive source was done by plasma coating with a 240 nm layer of titanium, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. This resulted in a highly radiochemically stable source. The response of endothelium and smooth muscle cells to a radioactive Rhenium-wire and its dosimetry was determined in an in vitro cell model. Our results confirmed that radioactive sources made from 186Re and, even more so, 188Re, are excellent candidates for restenosis inhibition because of their narrow treatment range, sharp dose gradient, inexpensive preparation, excellent stability, easy shielding and conveniently short treatment times.

Metallic rhenium powder of 325 mesh is readily available. Well characterized powder of micrometer size, however, is less easy to obtain. In this presentation, we describe how we prepared rhenium powder with an average particle size of 1-2 &#181;m, starting from 325 mesh material and using a jet mill. The particle size distribution was confirmed by light and scanning electron microscopy, and laser diffraction. The change in density and surface characteristics (porosity) was also analyzed. Biodegradable poly(lactic acid) microspheres were prepared, by a solvent evaporation method, from the resulting rhenium particles and were neutron activated in a nuclear reactor to directly yield 186/188Re-microspheres, useful for the treatment of liver tumors. Biodistribution data in rats as well as first treatment results of Novikoff tumors are presented.

RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY WITH RHENIUM-186 AND RHENIUM-188:</B> Alan R. Fritzberg, Fu-Min Su, NeoRx Corporation, 410 W. Harrison, Seattle, WA 98119<P>
The radioisotopes of rhenium, Re-186 and Re-188, have physical properties that make them attractive for radiotherapy via antibody mediated targeting. Rhenium186 has a half life of 3.78 days, maximum beta energy of 1.07 MeV and imageable gamma rays. Rhenium-188 has a half life of 17 hours, maximum beta energy of 2.12 MeV and imageable gamma rays. Rhenium-186~with its longer half life is appropriately matched with the larger antibody forms, IgG of 150 kD molecular weight and its F(ab')2 fragment of 100 kD size. Rhenium-188 with its shorter half life may be preferred in instances of rapid tumor uptake and shorter tumor retention. N,S amide thiolate chelating agents such as mercaptoacetylglycylglycyl-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-aminobutyrate have been developed for the attachment of the rhenium radioisotopes to antibodies. With this agent, over 150 patients with solid tumors have been treated with up to 550 mCi of Re-186. Several have had partial responses (&gt; 50% decrease in tumor size).

METALLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE FOR INCREASED GRAIN BOUNDARY DELINEATION OF RHENIUM ALLOYS</B>: Mitchell A. Jacobs, Jozef Fedko, Metallurgical Services Inc., Maywood, IL 60153<P>
Current metallographic preparation techniques for rhenium alloys have been based on the etch and back polish technique due to the soft nature of the rhenium alloys. To date the etch and back polish technique has adequately removed the flowed rhenium material to reveal the microstructure. Recent technology has allowed new polishing media to provide better removal of the flowed material. The resulting microstructure exhibits two dimensional relief in a slightly overetched condition. The significantly increased grain boundary delineation permits better review of the grain size.

Rhenium and other refractory metals in various product forms can be doped with potassium to stabilize an overlapping recrystallized grain structure for high temperature creep strength. Doping has been performed by ion-implantation into the surface layers of flat sheets. During fabrication of pressure-bonded or roll-bonded multi-layer composites the dopant was incorporated along strategically located internal planes. The dopant is arranged in planar arrays of fine bubbles which play the role of fenceposts as they anchor grain boundaries during recrystallization and grain growth. Doped layer composites can be heated to over 2000&#176;C and maintain an overlapping &quot;brick layer&quot; grain structure whereas undoped layer composites develop grains and grain boundaries that transverse the entire width of the composite.

SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAIN STRUCTURES IN POTASSIUM-IMPLANTED RHENIUM:</B> R.M. Collins, G. Welsch, Materials Science and Engineering , Case Western Reserve University, 514 White Bldg., Cleveland, OH 44106-7204<P>
Layer composites of rhenium (re) were made by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The Re layers range from 0.05 to 0.10 mm in thickness. Between Re layer depositions, potassium atoms were injected into the metal matrix by ion implantation to a depth of 600 angstroms and a peak concentration of 1 at%. At high temperatures, the implanted atoms cluster and form bubbles that remain stable and act as barriers that pin grain boundaries thus producing a means for creating artificial grain architectures. The grain structure of the implanted CVD layer composites is compared to that of the un-implanted CVD composite. Room temperature tensile tests show that the artificial grain architecture increases the overall tensile strength of the CVD rhenium composite.

Tensile properties of rhenium sheet, produced by powder technology techniques, were established from room temperature to 2000&#176;C. The strength of rhenium decreased gradually with increasing temperature while the elongation decreased drastically (from 20% to 5%) as the temperature increased from 1100 to 1200&#176;C. The elongation remained below 5% at temperatures up to 2000&#176;C. Tensile tests were also performed on rhenium -1% tungsten and rhenium-2% iridium. Both alloys were stronger than pure rhenium with the rhenium-1% tungsten alloy being the strongest. Limited creep and creep rupture tests were performed in the 1025 to 1225&#176;C range. The creep tests, with relatively low stresses, indicated a very low stress exponent of 1.3.

MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERISTICS OF Mo-Re ALLOYS SINTERED AT MEDIUM TEMPERATURES:</B> Rodolfo L. Mannheim, Jorge L. Garin, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Casilla 10233, Santiago, Chile
<P>
Mixtures of molybdenum and rhenium powders with particle size distribution bearing 2&#181;m average, were prepared in a planetary mill to yield the Mo-25%Re and Mo50%Re compositions. Tablets were then obtained by compaction at various pressures in the range of 300 to 800 MPa. The pieces were subject to sintering at temperatures of 1400 to 1700&#176;C, under protecting atmosphere of Ar-10%H2 to avoid oxidation of the component metals. The solution of rhenium in the molybdenum matrix was followed by means of X-ray diffraction: it was found that at all sintering temperatures rhenium was totally dissolved in the Mo-25%Re, while small amounts of an intermediate phase were detected in the case of the Mo-50%Re alloy, in good agreement with the phase diagram. The densification of the sintered parts increased with temperature and compaction pressure up to values around 90%. The microstructure of the specimens was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy, while the homogeneity of the sintered alloys was corroborated by EDX line-scan analysis. The microstructure showed well defined equi-axed grains with some microporosity distributed across the surface. A few initial tests on cold rolling of the resulting specimens were conducted with very promising results; in fact, owing to the fine particle size of the powders, the sintering temperature can be lower than those normally utilized in the refractory metals industry.

Because of their capability for producing high power densities without interruption for long time periods (years) small, fast neutron energy spectrum nuclear reactors are candidates for applications such as orbiting satellites, lunar and Mars terrestrial power stations and manned trips to Mars. To provide high efficiency in the conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy, these reactors must operate at high temperatures (e.g. &gt;1000&#176;C) and they are cooled with liquid metals such as lithium. Because of its high temperature strength and excellent chemical compatibility with lithium, rhenium (Re) has been considered for use in nuclear reactors for space power. In a space reactor the Re would be subjected to fast neutron irradiation to fluences of more than 1x1022n/cm2 (Ea &gt; 0.1MeV) during several years of operation. The current work was performed to provide information on the tensile properties of Re as a function of test temperature and the effects of neutron irradiation at high temperatures on these properties. Ductility of Re is high (~40%) at low temperatures but decreased abruptly to less than 5% at temperatures about ~900&#176;C. The work hardening coefficient is very high at room temperature and decreases slowly with increased test temperature. Fast neutron iradiation at approximately 1000, 1100, and 1300&#176;C to fluences of 8x1021 and 4x1022n/cm2 resulted in increases in strength and decreases in ductility for tests at room temperature, at the irradiation temperature, and at fifty degrees above the irradiation temperature. These effects decreased with increased irradiation temperature and increased with increased fluence. Also, irradiation lowered by more than 200&#176;C the temperature of the abrupt increase in ductility.

The microstructure and mechanical characteristics of cast alloys Cr-35 Re and Cr-18 Re have been investigated within the wide temperature interval (20-1300&#176;C). It was found that under uniaxial tension within 20-600&#176;C the plasticity of the alloys run into 10-20, whereas it decreased when the temperature rose above 700&#176;C. The appearance of the plastic intercrystalline fracture at the temperatures above 900&#176;C resulted in the sharp decrease of strength and plasticity of the alloys. It was established that small quantities of impurities CN, C, O) contained in source materials effected the fracture mechanisms substantially. The additives of Fe to the alloys under investigation did not altered plastic characteristics at high test temperatures. The other perfomed research permitted to consider that the Cr-Re alloys can be obtained with high mechanical properties and within the temperature interval 700-1300&#176;C.

Rheocast ingots of an AZ9 ID magnesium alloy were produced with different processing conditions. Processing variables included stirring rate (Vs) and stirring temperature (Ts). The microstructures of the rheocast AZ9lD magnesium alloys were similar to those of composite materials consisted of soft primary particles distributed in the hard matrix. A detailed examination was made on the relation between processing variables and mechanical properties. With increasing Vs and Ts, the size and the solid volume fraction of the soft primary particles decreased and the hardness and the UTS of the rheocast alloys increased. The mechanical properties of the rheocast alloys were analyzed quantitatively as a function of microstructural parameters such as the size and the solid volume fraction of the primary particles.

There has been considerable interest in the production of light weight composite materials for aerospace applications. One of the promising candidates is an in-situ composite consisted of Be and Al. This material combines a high elastic modulus, low density with a relatively high melting point. Unlike the brittle Be, which does not undergo extensive plastic deformation prior to failure, the Be-Al alloys examined in the present study exhibit a remarkable formability. Both extruded and rolled products have been prepared successfully. However, the mechanisms responsible for these attractive characteristics of the Be-Al alloys have not yet been identified. Thus, it is timely and important to ascertain the active deformation modes governing the deformation charac teristics of Be when present in a continuous matrix of aluminum. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine the effect of the aluminum on the inhibition of initiation of cleave in the Be-Al alloys. In the present paper, we will present the results on the microstructural characterization of mechanically tested samples using SEM and TEM. The deformation behavior has been studied by SEM based fractography and TEM based on defects analyses. The observed fracture mechanisms will be discussed in terms of dislocation mobilities in the Al and the BE phase respectively.

Mg alloys offer the potential for significant weight savings in aerospace components because of their low density. Nevertheless, there is a strong need for Mg alloys with much improved mechanical properties. The main objective of the present research is to improve the mechanical properties of Mg alloys by squeeze casting and by alloy modification. The addition of Si results in the formation of Mg2Si in two morphologies; polygon and chinese script. While the polygonal Mg2Si improves the mechanical properties of Mg alloys, the chinese script Mg2Si promotes the brittle fracture along the Mg2Si/matrix interface, resulting in poor ductility. Microalloying elements have been added to modify the morphology of chinese script Mg2Si. It has been shown that the additions of Ca or P eliminate the chinese script Mg2Si so that all of the Mg2Si particles are present in polygonal form, resulting in the improvement of mechanical properties.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODELING OF SUPERPLASTICITY:</B> F. Booeshaghi, H. Garmestani, P. N. Kalu, Department of Mechanical Engineering, FAMUFSU College of Engineering, Tallahassee, FL<P>
There has been an increased interest in the mechanics and materials field to improve the constitutive relations for the superplastic deformation of advanced materials. This interest has been stimulated partly due to the discovery of high strain rate superplasticity, and partly due to the availability of powerful computers. In this paper, an attempt was made to develop new type of constitutive relations to elucidate superplasticity. Although the model was derived from Hart's model, it incorporates detailed microstructural parameters and can be extended to multiaxial deformation. An attempt was made to use the model to explain the deformation mechanisms in superplastic AlLi 7475 and Al-Li 8090 alloys. Load relaxation and jump strain rate tests were employed in this investigation. Microstructural characterization was carried out by optical nicroscopy and orientation Imaging Microscopy.

WATERJET ABRASIVE APPLICATIONS FOR LIGHT WEIGHT ALLOYS</B>: <I>Lin Zhong Lee</I>, Laser Applications, Inc., Westminster, MD 21157<P>
As the aerospace applications of light weight alloys expand, waterjet abrasive process is a viable approach to manufacturing. This technology utilizes high pressurized water and an abrasive passing through a nozzle that is capable of cutting most materials up to 9&quot; thick. It provides precision cutting of any contour, shape, and size which will allow engineers and designers the freedom to create more complex designs. The main components of a waterjet system consist of an ultrahigh pressure intensifier, a cutting head, and a CNC controller. The jet parameters consist of the water pressure, orifice size, nozzle size, abrasive type, abrasive flow rate and cutting head feedrate. The kinetic energy is created from the mass of the water and abrasive exiting the nozzle at twice the speed of sound. At this high velocity, the jet stream acts like a solid medium that erodes the material. The efficiency of the waterjet is dependent on the initial energy leaving the nozzle and the energy required to remove the material. Therefore, it is easier to cut a soft and thin material than a hard and thick material. Through this process, superior edge quality is achieved with no heat affect zone (HAZ), no metal contamination, no distortion, no slag, and no delamination.

MICROMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF ADHESION STRENGTH FOR A BRITTLE FILM COATED SUBSTRATE:</B> Jeunghyun Jeong, HaeSeok Park, JeongHoon Ahn and Dongil Kwon, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151742, Korea<P>
In this work, we attempted to estimate the interface adhesion strength through the stress analysis in a brittle film coated substrate by two methods: scratch method and film cracking method. Firstly, in a scratch test, the critical load used as a qualitative estimate of adhesion is converted into work of adhesion by analyzing the stress field beneath the indenter, which results from three contributions, i.e., the static indentation added by the blister stress field, the friction between the indenter and film, and the residual stress. Secondly, in uniaxial loading of a brittle film coated soft substrate, the adhesion dependency of the development behavior of the transverse film cracks is analyzed specifying the film tensile stress and the interface shear stress which induce film cracking and interface failure, respectively. Then, the interface adhesion is quantified as interface shear strength because the stoppage of film cracking with further straining means the interface failure by the excessive interface shear stress, and the saturated value of crack spacing and strain can be used for the qualitative comparison of adhesion.

Pulsed electromagnetic field have been used to size thinwalled shells inside calibration dies. This works even when the shell have been formed by bending sheet metal and closed by a welding seam. Deformation is accomplished by a highvoltage discharge of capacitors through a coil inside the shell. Experimental results for AlCuFeM high strength alloy rings are presented. They show a significant improvement of the accuracy of shell dimensions with increasing pressure amplitude. Results of the numerical simulation of the shell-die contact interaction are obtained assuming that shell is elastoplastic and the die is elastic. Solid mechanics equation of motion and elastoplastic flow rule have been used to simulate this process. This simulation takes account of multiple impacts, spring back, stress waves in shell and die and has been experimentally validated.

ZIRCONIUM CARBIDE SYNTHESIS IN A HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA REACTOR:</B> Patrick R. Taylor, Banqiu Wu and Edgar E. Vidal, University of Idaho, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Mining Engineering, Moscow, ID 83844-3024<P>
Zirconium carbide powder has been synthesized from zircon concentrate and methane using a high temperature plasma reactor. A non-transferred DC plasma torch was used as heat source. A high temperature filter consisting of graphite felt was designed, built and operated to separate the zirconium carbide from silicon carbide during the process. Characterization of the collected powders was done by wet chemical analysis using Atomic Absorption (AA), Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). It was found that the zirconium carbide purity was around 95% with silicon carbide being the primary impurity. The powders had particle sizes between 30 and 80 nm. Based on the XRD pattern a lattice parameter of 4.6932A was calculated for the zirconium carbide. The effect of several experimental variables is presented as well as a mathematical model that describes the temperature and velocity profiles in the reactor.

Cylinders of commercial aluminum alloy 6063 were homogenized under different conditions. The experimental results indicate that the general mechanical behavior as related to curves of 0.2% yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility versus homogenizing process is the same in both cases. These mechanical properties as compared to those required by plant specifications, tend to be better with increasing values of %Mg2Si in the alloy, as expected. The electron microscopy investigations revealed that in both homogenizing processes the resulting microstructure consist of significant spheroidizing of the alpha phase (AlFeSi) and fine - needle type structures of the beta phase. The alpha phase was also present in a Chinese scripture type structure. Furthermore, the slow cooling within the furnace resulted in the nucleation and growth of Mg2Si precipitates generally along the grain boundaries.

The progress in understanding of the nature of strain localization in metallic materials and in particular understanding of the role of external (deformation conditions) and internal (material substructure) factors in the development of the tendency toward concentration of plastic flow within transgranular shear bands has laid at the background of the pointed in the title idea. Following this idea, a practical possibility of replacement a homogeneous in a micro scale mode of deformation by transgrasnular shear bands gives a chance to change the arrangement of dislocation substructure in the material from that typical for homogeneous deformation into a long wavelength (transgranular), pseudo-periodic dislocation walls. The presence or formation of such a substructure in a thermodynamically unstable matrix may result in formation of the products of phase transformation along shear bands, giving rise to a composite like structure. The experimental verification of the idea is the main aim of the work. The spectrum of different materials undergoing (post or during shear banding) different phase transformations: precipitation from supersaturated solid solution in Al-base alloys, martensitic transformation in Fe-Ni alloy, austenite-ferrite and austenite perlite transformation in the plain carbon steel and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/beta.gif"> transformation in Cu-Zn brass has been studied by use of the optical and electron microscopy.

In this study the characteristic factors and formation mechanisms for the hydrothermal preparation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-quartz crystal powders were investigated to find the optimum synthetic conditions. The degree of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-quartz crystal face development depended on the relative growth rate of a particular form that varies considerable with the degree of supersaturation, the reaction temperature, the concentration of mineralizers, and the presence of seed crystals in the feedstock.

The fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif"> quartz crystal powders were obtained in the temperature range of 250-500&#176;C and pressure range of 100-300 atm. As the concentration of mineralizers increased, the particle size of crystalline powders became smaller with lower reaction temperatures. The fractional size distribution of synthetic crystal powders was depended on the hydrothermal conditions. As the reaction time and the amount of seed crystals increased, the width of particle size distribution became narrower. The weight mean particle size was in the range of 1 to 10&#181;m. The characterization of the products were carried out using XRD, SEM, PSA, FTIR, Raman Spectrometer.

THE INTRAGRANULAR FERRITE PLATE AND ITS NUCLEATING INCLUSIONS IN HAZ OF X-60 PIPE STEEL:</B> Jiang Guo Chang, Zhu Yu Ru, Guo Shu<B></B> Qiang, Xu Jian Lun, Department of Materials, Shanghai University, 149 Yan Chang Road, Shanghai 200072, China; Wang<B></B> Yue Qlang,<B></B> Pan Li Ying, Yu Di Wei, Bao Shan Iron &amp; Steel Corporation<P>
To improve the HAZ toughness of X-60 pipe steel the intragranular ferrite plate (IFP) technology was used. The characteristics of IFP is claimed to be much fine ferrite plates appear inside the original austenite grains. By means of a suitable Re, Zr, Ti additions in a bath with a higher initial oxygen potential, and a good control over the peak temperature as well as the cooling rate during welding simulation, one get a%IFP in volume over 50%, and the toughness goes up from 55J to 160J. It was found that the inclusions most effective on nucleating IFP are some deformable complex silicates which either entrapping Re, Zr, Ti oxides or containing these elements. The more the evenly distributed and effectively nucleating inclusions, the more the % IFP in volume, and the finer the microstructure of the HAZ, so the better the relevant toughness. Generally, these silicates behave as fine spheres along a line. The present authors revealed that these fine spheres result from the remelting of the silicates due to temperature raising up in the process of welding simulation. These silicates used to get a higher sulfur capacity, so MnS deposits might be observed on the periphery of the silicates. IFP was proved to be directly rooted in the [Mn] depleting zone which locates beside MnS deposits.

Post transitional elements present a lot of physical properties, especially in the fields of electronic and opto-electronic. Thus the knowledge of binary and ternary phase diagrams is of great importance both for the elaboration of alloys and for their application. One of the characteristics of the elements of post transition is a low melting point and for a large number of them a high vapor pressure. For this last reason it is of great interest to include the gas phase with the condensed phases and to calculate the pressure dependence of the phase diagram. In this lecture, we present experimental data and the result of the optimization for some systems such as: cd-Ge, Cd-Te, Zn-Te, Cd-Zn-Te, Ge-Te, Si-Te, Au-Te. All of these binary systems are included in a database (POSTRANS) compatible with Thermocalc.

The phase diagram and thermochemistry of the In-Se system have been studied by several investigators, however, the liquid mixture behavior is not well understood. The following galvanic cell: W|In(I),In2O3(s)||In2O3(s),[In]In-Se(s or 1)|C|W was used to determine the activity of In in In-Se liquid alloys in the compositional range 0.10&lt;xse,0.60 and the temperature range 800 to 975 K. Slightly positive deviations from ideal solution behavior were observed in the liquid solution and the measured liquids temperatures were in good agreement with those reported in the literature. In addition, the Gibbs energy of formation for each intermediate compound was derived from the measured values of emf. These results were then combined with other experimental data available in the literature to reassess the thermochemistry and the In-Se phase diagram. Four intermediate solid phases (In4 Se3, InSe, In6Se7, and In2Se3) were considered to be line compounds in this assessment and the Redlich-Kister expression was used to model the liquid phase.

Group III arsenides and antimonides are extremely important materials used in the manufacture of high speed and high frequency electronic devices. In the III-V semiconductor family As-Ga-In-Sb, there are four ternary subsystems. By selecting different compositions within these subsystems, electrical and optical properties of the material can be changed in order to satisfy different applications. In this work, experimental phase diagram information and thermochemical data available in the literature for the As-Ga-Sb and As-In-Sb systems have been critically assessed as a preliminary step towards the study of the As-Ga-In-Sb system. Thermodynamic descriptions of the phases that are consistent with selected experimental data have been produced using the ternary optimizing program TERGSS and thermodynamic descriptions of the binary and unary phases from previous assessments. Phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties are presented which have been calculated from the optimized coefficients using MTDATA. This information can be used for optimizing materials growth conditions and device manufacture.

POTENTIOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF THE THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY OF SB2O3:</B> R. Lowery, C. Mallika, and T.J. Anderson, Dept. of Chemical Engr., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611<P>
Precise values of thermodynamic properties of Sb2O3 are required to synthesize and characterize the alloys of antimony for applications in thermoelectric devices and semiconductor technology. The Gibbs energy formation of Sb2O3 has been reliably reported in the literature using solid electrolyte emf measurements. This work is extended to determine the phase equilibrium temperatures in Sb/Sb2O3 system. The galvanic cell used in this study can be represented as W|C|Sb(s or 1), Sb2O3(s or 1)_YSZ_ Cu2O,Cu|W. The oxygen potential for the biphasic mixtures were derived from the cell potential data over the temperature range 790 to 983 K. Phase transition temperatures of 845.5 K (Sb2O3, orthorhombic to Sb2O3, cubic), 905.6 K (Sb,s to Sb,1) and 930.0K (Sb2O3,cubic to Sb2O3,1) were obtained from discernible breaks in the emf-T plots. These results agree well with calorimetric values. A value of -712.4 kJ/mol calculated by third-law treatment for DH&#176;f,298 (Sb2O3, orthorhombic) reasonably agrees with literature data.

Ternary system Ga-Sb-Bi belongs to the group of alloy systems containing semi-conducting compounds, which are important from both the scientific and practical point of view. While binary systems Ga-Sb, Bi-Sb and Ga-Bi are mostly thermodynamically determined, there are only a few data about the thermodynamics of the investigated ternary system Ga-Bi-Sb. Because of the experimental difficulties in thermodynamic determination of this system, connected with the oxidation and volatizing of the present components at investigation temperatures, thermodynamic predicting is applied, and results of the comparative determination of thermodynamic properties in ternary system Ga-Sb-Bi by using following methods: Toop, R-function and general solution model, are given in this paper.

To establish the vapor-liquid equilibrium composition relations of In-Sn, In-Pb, In-Zn, the Miedema's cellular model of heat of formation of binary liquid alloys are employed to correlate the activity coefficients of each component in the binary. Based on the dissimilar Wigner-Seitz atomic cells model, a quantitative analysis of heats of mixing and solution of binary alloys was Miedema. Tanaka deduced the relation between mixing enthalpy and excess entropy of liquid binary alloy. Through the correlation between the heat of formation and excess Gibbs free energy, the activity coefficients and their practical pressures can be analyzed. The obtained results have met the needs of activity coefficients of each component in above alloys in the applications of vacuum separation techniques, as well as in the development of lead-free solder of In-Sn binary or related multicomponent systems.

Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric technique has been employed to study the thermodynamic and phase diagram properties of transition metal-tellurium systems. Preferential evaporation of these metal tellurides has been made use of to generate the nonstoichiometric telluride phases in situ. From the variation of tellurium activity as a function of composition, homogeneity ranges of the nonstoichiometric metal tellurides have been arrived at. By applying Gibbs-Duhem integration the thermodynamic activity of the second component could be arrived at. From the activities, partial molar Gibbs free energies were derived. Some of the metal tellerium systems studied include Fe-Te, Cr-Te, Mo-Te and Mn-Te. In this paper we describe some of our results with emphasis on the usefulness of Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric method for deriving such information.

The As-Se-based chalcogenide glasses are IR transparent, and are considered an ideal braze to the ZnSe and ZnS substrates in the IR detector. The interfacial reactions between As-Se and Zn are investigated for fundamental understanding. Three different kinds of reaction couples were prepared, and they were As-50at%Se/Zn at 350&#176;C. As-50at%Se/Zn at 370&#176;C, and As-60at%Se/Zn at 350&#176;C annealed for various length of time. The cross sections of the reaction couples were analyzed by using OM and EPMA. Two phases were formed at the interface, and the diffusion paths were glass/ZnSe/As2Zn3/Zn. The growth rates of the intermetallic layers were also determined by using as image analyzer. The growth rates followed the parabolic law for the type I and type III couples which indicated a diffusion-controlled mechanism.

Tellurium forms technologically important alloys which are being used increasingly in the semiconductor industry (CdTe,Bi2Te3). As such, control of the purity of the source TE metal is critical. Therefore, the understanding of the atmospheric oxidation of tellerium cannot be neglected, as it can be a source of oxygen incorporation in the metal, and thus in the alloys. We have studied, by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), the oxidation of crushed tellerium under various conditions of humidity and air exposure. The rate of oxidation of tellerium is relatively slow: 30 A of tellerium dioxide is detected on the surface of a sample after 8 days of direct air exposure. Our results tend to suggest that the rate-limiting step is the transport of the oxidizing reactant to the tellerium surface. We have also observed that the oxidation reaction is dependent on the relative humidity, as has been reported previously, for thin films, by various authors.

MECHANISMS OF FATIGUE FRACTURE IN METALLIC, CERAMIC, AND INTERMETALLIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>Robert O.

From his early micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue-crack propagation in anti-plane shear to his later hypothesis for the existence of a fatigue threshold, Frank McClintock has made many seminal contributions to the understanding of fatigue fracture in metallic materials. In this presentation, current thinking on the mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue is examined, with particular emphasis on the similarities and differences between metal fatigue and the failure of monolithic and composite intermetallics and ceramics under cyclic loading. This is achieved by considering the process of fatigue-crack growth as a mutual competition between intrinsic mechanisms of crack advance ahead of the crack tip (e.g., alternating shear), which promote crack growth, and extrinsic mechanisms of crack-tip shielding behind the tip (e.g., crack closure and bridging), which impede it. The widely differing nature of these mechanisms and their specific dependence upon the alternating and maximum driven forces (e.g., <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">K and Kmax) provide a useful distinction of the process of fatigue-crack propagation in the different classes of materials.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUCLEATION AND MICROSTRUCTURALLY DEPENDENT CRACK PROPAGATION IN STRUCTURAL METALLIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>David W. Hoeppner</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Quality and Integrity Design Engineering Center, University of Utah, 3209 MEB, Salt Lake City, UT 84112<P>
In the mid 1800's Sorby used the optical microscope to study fatigue deformation of materials and started an activity that continues with some vigor today. The early investigators of fatigue deformation wanted to learn the mechanism(s) of fatigue crack nucleation and propagation. This progress was aided by many investigators including Frank McClintock. McClintock and other investigators inspired many investigators to pursue the observation of fatigue deformation so that improved understanding of fatigue mechanisms could be attained. However, many studies that were made were &quot;static&quot;. That is, materials were exposed to cyclic loading and then viewed with the observational technique. While this allowed some progress to be made, this did not deal with the actual deformation(s) that were occurring and thus progress in understanding fatigue was very limited. However, some investigators did mount microscopes on fatigue machines and make what became known as &quot;in-situ&quot; observations. Some of the contributions made will be reviewed as background of this paper. The development of the scanning electron microscope has changed the understanding of cyclic deformation response in engineering and model materials. Starting in 1970 numerous investigators around the world developed fatigue machines that were either placed in the chamber of an SEM or were attached to the SEM. Contributions of Kromp, Weiss, Strickler, Kikukawa, Jono, Aachi, Davidson, Hoeppner and others will be reviewed. In addition the past 25 years has seen the development of numerous in-situ systems. This has led to much greater understanding of fatigue crack nucleation and microstructurally dependent propagation. These studies and observations will be reviewed in the paper.

Fatigue crack growth occurs due to irreversibility associated with the plastic flow under cyclic load. Although crack growth occurs by plastic flow, the use of elastic fracture mechanics parameter to quantify crack growth may still be justified since material for the most part is under elastic loading, normally termed as small scale loading. In the past, concepts such as plasticity induced crack closure have crept into the literature and led to massive confusion in the literature in understanding and quantifying fatigue crack growth. We present new unifying concepts using dislocation models that accounts, load-ratio effects, so-called anomalous effects of short cracks, over-load and under-load effects, as well as concepts that connect the crack nucleation through Kitagaawa diagram.

The mechanisms of fatigue striation formation are reviewed in terms of ductile and brittle fracture processes. Depending on these processes, fatigue striations can show considerable morphological variations, which are explained in terms of detailed slip processes and dislocation structures as well as fracture mechanisms. The problem of striation formation during intergranular crack propagation is also treated with respect to new results obtained on bicrystals having misorientation. These results are helpful for understanding how striation formation is related to the geometry and crystallography of slip at the crack tip.

INFLUENCE OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON LOW CYCLE FATIGUE FRACTURE:</B> <I>S. L. Mannan, </I>K. Bhanu Sankara Rao, Materials Development Division, Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam 603 102, India<P>
High temperature low cycle fatigue (LCF) has been an area of great interest in the last decades because of its relevance in nuclear and aerospace industrial applications. In general, the cyclic deformation and fracture of alloys engineered for high performance applications depend critically on the stability of initial microstructure during cyclic loading and on the slip mode, both of which in turn depending on temperature, govern the cyclic stress response and the mode of crack initiation and propagation. In order to attain adequate fatigue resistance in high temperature materials, a thorough understanding of quantitative relationship between initial microstructure and the fracture mode is required. Grain size, degree of prior cold work, thermal aging that occurs prior to and during service are the major structural parameters that influence LCF of austenitic stainless steels while the size and distribution of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' and carbides control the cyclic deformation and fracture in nickel base superalloys. Low cycle fatigue studies have been conducted on 304SS to examine the effects of grain size (75, 310 and 700 &#181;m), cold work (0, 10, 20 and 30%) and thermal aging (923K: 1000h, 3000h, 5000h) on LCF fracture over a very wide temperature range (300-1023K). Fine grained material exhibited better endurance in terms of total and plastic strain amplitudes at all temperatures. The temperature dependence of fatigue life showed a complex behaviour. Medium and coarse grained alloy displayed a continuous reduction in life with increase in temperature with recovery in life at elevated temperatures. The effects of grain size on life were rationalised on the basis of martensite transformation, dynamic strain aging, oxidation and creep in the temperature range of their operation. The superior fatigue resistance of fine grained material has been attributed to the occurrence of trangranular fracture at all the temperatures. Cold work has been found to be both beneficial and harmful for fatigue life depending on the temperature. LCF life decreased with increasing PCW at and below 823K, whereas at 923K, PCW levels greater than 10% cold work exhibited recovery in life due to the reduced incidence of intergranular cracking. Thermal aging prior to LCF testing promoted transgranular cracking and improved fatigue resistance. The influence of microstructure (A: free from carbides and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">', B: peak aged spherical <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' of 18 nm diameter and C: overaged spherical <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' of 35 nm diameter) on strain controlled LCF behaviour of Nimonic PE-16 superalloy has been studied at 923 K. Coffin-Manson plots describing the plastic strain amplitude versus life showed that Microstructure A had maximum fatigue resistance while C displayed the least. Microstructure B showed a two slope behaviour in the Coffin-Manson plot. For this condition samples cycled at low strain amplitudes exhibited much shorter lives than would be expected by extrapolation from high strain portion of the plot. Microstructure A exhibited crack initiation in planar slip bands, followed by transgranular propagation marked by fatigue striations. In B, the fracture mode at high strains was transgranular, while at low strains propagation by both trans and intergranular (mixed mode) was observed. Alloy C displayed cleavage facets very frequently on the fracture surface, and crack propagation was mixed mode at all strain amplitudes. The microstructural dependence of LCF behaviour and fracture modes have been rationalised on the basis of operative deformation mechanisms, degree of slip homogenization and the evolving microstructure during cyclic deformation. The degree of homogeneity was assessed by slip band spacing measurements on tested samples. These studies on 304SS and Nimonic PE-16 emphasise the need for optimisation of microstructure for maximizing fatigue resistance.

CORROSION FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF METALS AND ALLOYS:</B> <I>David J. Duquette</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180
<P>
The qualitative aspects of the effects of corrosion on the fatigue behavior of metals and alloys have been recognized for more than 60 years. However, for much of that time, corrosion was assumed to lower fatigue resistance, simply by either inducing stress raisers in the form of pitting, or by reducing the cross-sectional area of a component. Modern research has shown that there may be a complex synergism between corrosion and the cyclic deformation response of metallic materials. This synergism may affect precrack deformation, crack nucleation and/or crack propagation. This presentation will address this synergism, and attempt to demonstrate that neither simple corrosion models for crack initiation, nor superposition models where corrosion rates and fatigue crack propagation rates are numerically added, are adequate to represent corrosion fatigue damage.

THE EVOLUTION OF A CONSTITUTIVE RELATION FOR FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH:</B> <I>Arthur J. McEvily</I>, Department of Metallurgy and Institute of Materials Science, U-136, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268
<P>
Load sequence effect can exert a strong influence on the rate of fatigue crack growth. For example, a large spike overload can result in a period of crack growth retardation after the overload. In order to calculate the number of delay cycles resulting from such an overload, a constitutive equation is needed, and it has been proposed that the following equation provides a generally valid constitutive relationship for the rate of fatigue crack growth: da/dN = A (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keff - Keffth)2 where <I>a</I> is the crack length, <I>N</I> is the number of cycles, <I>A</I> is a material constant, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keff is the effective range of the stress intensity factor, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keffth is the effective range of stress intensity factor at threshold. This equation can only be used if crack closure effects are accounted for. Examples of the use of the equation to calculate the number or retardation cycles following an overload as a function of specimen thickness will be given. In addition, the application of the equation to the study of short crack growth involving high-low and low-high load sequences will also be demonstrated.

MICROMECHANICS OF FATIGUE AND FRACTURE IN LAMELLAR TiAl:</B> <I>Bimal K. Kad, </I>Robert J. Asaro, Department of Applied Mechanics &amp; Engineering Sciences, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093<P>
While phenomological correlations, or simple rules of mixtures, are an important initial step in predicting the composite bulk response, the complexities of inhomogeneous deformation in layered morphologies, strain partitioning and incompatibilities between the respective micro-constituents, and discrete interface slip characteristics present formidable challenges for microstructural design. Thus, finite element based numerical procedures, incorporating phyically based crystal plasticity models, are employed to study the evolution of non-uniform deformation, under monotonic and fully reversed cyclic loadings, in lamellar TiAl microstructures. The impetus for such efforts is to gather fundamental insight into microstructure sensitive deformation mechanisms, and to extract additional information, not obtainable from traditional mechanical property data measurements. Such an effort is particularly desirable to help track various aspects of plastic anisotropy of specific layers, and micro-constituents are implicit in polycrystalline aggregates. We will present several examples of experimentally observed, and numerically computed results, to identify hot spots for strain localization in fully reversed loadings, and prescribe microstructural remedies to alleviate such effects.

STEADY-STATE FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH IN COMPOSITE LAMINATES:</B> <I>J. Tong</I>, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Portmouth, Anglesea Building, Anglesea Road, Portmouth PO1 3DJ, UK<P>
Matrix crack growth behaviour under mechanical fatigue loading has been studied in a quasi-isotropic GFRP laminate. Detailed experimental observations have been made on the growth of individual cracks and the accumulation of cracks in &#177;45&#176;C as well as 90&#176; plies. The results show that when the crack length is sufficiently long compared with the layer thickness, the growth of fatigue cracks in off-axis layers is essentially independent of crack length, a phenomenon termed as steady-state cracking. A generalised plane strain finite element model has been constructed and used to relate the crack growth rate to the associated strain energy release rate. A good correlation has been achieved which indicates that strain energy release rate may be the appropriate parameter to characterise stable matrix growth behaviour in composite laminates.

EXPERIMENTAL BASED DETECTION OF THE SPLASH LIMITS FOR THE NORMAL AND OBLIQUE IMPACT OF MOLTEN METAL PARTICLES ON DIFFERENT SURFACES</B>: M. Berg, J. Ulrich, Universitat Bremen, SFB 372,Verfahrenstechnik/FB4, Postfach 330440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany
<P>
Understanding of the impact of single molten metal particles contribute to reduce the overspray during the spray deposition processes. The impact of molten Pb- and Sn-particles with a flat solid surface is investigated experimentally. The impact process is monitored by a high speed video system. At each measurement all temperatures (particle, target, and ambient) are taken as the weight of the particle before and after impact. By means of the image processing, the final diameter of the splat is found and evaluated regarding physicla properties, impacting diameter, impact power, and target surface roughness. By the weight difference of a particle before and after the impact, amount of splashing material is detected. The impact diameter, the impact speed, and the spreading diameter are also observed by the high speed, and the spreading diameter are also observed by the high speed video system. The results are presented in the form of diagrams with dimensionless numbers such as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter, d, to the initial particule diameter, D. Other numbers such as Weber, We, or Reynolds, Re, in connection with d/D ratio give the possibility of comparing all experimental results with each other. A critical dimensionless number above which splashing exists has been discussed.

MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION OF AL-SI AND AL-MMCS PROCESSED BY SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION: </B> Jose Luis Estrada, Enrique Nicolas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Unidad Profesional Adolfo Lopez Mateos, MEXICO; Enrique J. Lavernia, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717<P>
The spray atomization and deposition process is described as applied to Al-Si alloys and Al-Si metal matrix composites. This process shown to be similar to powder metallurgy (P/M) in that advanced alloys can be manufactured. However, many difficulties inherent in P/M are avoided, including oxide film formation and the need for degassing. In the spray atomization and deposition process atomized droplets exist for only a few milliseconds before being deposited to form high density preforms. The primary metallurgical characteristics of Al-12w/oSi, Al-17w/oSi, Al22w/oSi and Al-alloy based MMCs reinforced with SiC particulates preforms are presented. Characterization of the preforms consisted of the description of the production technique, descriptions of the microstructures by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The volume percentage of reinforced particles was determined. Both the spray deposited Al-Si alloys and the Al-Si metal matrix composites exhibited a rapid solidified matrix microstructure and the spray deposited MMCs a relatively uniform distribution of reinforcements.

TUNGSTEN BORIDE SYNTHESIS IN BURNING</B>: <I>S.V. Nikolenko</I>, V.V. Gostischev, Institute of Materials, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Nowadays, a great theoretical and practical interest is observed towards tungsten boride, that can be explained by its' specific physical, chemical and mechanical properties. This paper discusses the process of tungsten boride extraction by alumothermy from the tungsten-containing mineral (sheelite concentrate) derived from the original product by enriching. The experiments were conducted in air and vacuum. The study of the extracted products has shown that their composition differs and depends on the synthesis conditions. For example, if we use B2O3, in relation W:B=1:2; 1:3; 1:4, as a boride element, then we get the lower borides as the synthesis products: W2B, WB and metallic tungsten. The use of boron oxide with coal gives W2C together with W2B5. Including boron carbide guarantees that we shall receive the higher boride W2B5, independently from the environment of the reaction, due to the high speed of the burning. The conducted set of experiments, shows the possibility of synthesizing tungsten boride-base powders from the enriched mineral raw materials, which can be used for electro-spark and laser deposition of wear and heat resistant harding coats on construction and instrumental steels.

POROSITY AND OXIDE DISTRIBUTION IN SPRAY FORMED Al-Cr-Zr ALLOYS</B>: M. Baker, A. Hellwig, A.F. Norman, <I>P. Tsakiropoulos</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK<P>
In spray formed Al alloys porosity is common and typically about 2 to 8% depending on alloy and product form and the oxygen content is typically less than the level of oxygen in commercially produced RS/PM Al alloys. There is no experimental evidence available about the distribution of Al2O3 in spray formed Al alloys. We have studied the size and distribution of pores and the distribution of oxides in spray formed Al-Cr-Zr alloys. The fracture surfaces of the as sprayed and forged deposits were examined by AES and SAM. Cratered regions on the in situ fracture surfaces were identified and a localized 2nm thick Al2O3 film on their surface was measured by high resolution AES. The fracture path followed areas rich in Al2O3.

The technical problems and cost associated with the multi-step PM processing of RS Al alloys have hindered their successful development. Spray forming can obviate these problems by means of the integral inert gas atomisation and deposition operation in which the alloy exists in particulate form only for a few milliseconds. Spray forming experiments have been performed on Al-Cr-Zr alloys studied previously by the combined RS/PM route. The microstructure and the tensile properties of the forged and heat treated deposits will be compared with the RS/PM alloy. The latter exhibits superior properties, not matched by the spray formed alloy.

ABOUT SELECTION AND DESIGN OF ELECTRODE MATERIALS FOR ELECTRO-SPARK ALLOYING OF STEELS</B>: <I>A.D. Verkhoturo, </I>S.V. Nikolenko, Institute of Materials, Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Earlier, we have proposed several parameters of selecting and designing electrode materials for electro-spark alloying (ESA) of metallic surfaces. These parameters were developed according to the necessity of achieving the maximum depth, continuity, the least stress in the alloyed layer (AL), as well as the least roughness. However, the developed principles account only for the &quot;geometrical&quot; characteristics of AL, without accounting for the technological characteristics, and the current manufacturing demands: higher productivity of the ESA process, creating the optimal conditions for the AL forming. Considering all of the above this paper discusses: 1) The scientific principles of designing and selecting the multi-component electrode materials, that account for the electrode space composition, as well as the composition-structure-characteristics relationship of electrode materials on the physical-chemical characteristics of AL and allowing to decrease fragile destruction of electrode material in the total erosion phenomena. 2) &quot;Technological&quot; scheme of AL forming, that accounts for effect of physical-chemical properties of electrodes, parameters of ESA process on physical-chemical and exploitational properties of AL and allowing to receive coatings with given characteristics. According to these principles several new electrode materials have been created, using tungsten carbide and titanium base with self-fluxing and mineral additives that allow to greatly increase wear and heat resistance of construction and instrumental steels.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS DURING LINEAR SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION</B>: Y. Zhou, E.J.

The linear spray atomization and deposition is a potential near-net shape technique for continuous production of aluminum alloys. Possible benefits of linear spray atomization and deposition are: a) deposit geometry improvement, b) high productivity, c) high aspect ratio, and d) low overspray yield. In the present study, characterization of metal sprays using phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA), such as droplet velocity distribution, droplet size, droplet size distribution and spatial distribution, was carried out. The droplet size distribution of aluminum alloy powders were also studied using the mechanical sieving method to compare with the results obtained using PDPA. The plot of the axial velocity with droplet diameter reveals the relationship that smaller droplets have higher axial velocity than do lager droplets. The results also indicate that the axial velocity exhibit the bimodal behavior when atomization pressure approaches a certain critical value and this bimodal behavior behaves increasingly with higher atomization pressure. The Sauter mean diameter obtained using PDPA and the mass median diameter using the mechanical sieving show a decreasing trend with increasing atomization pressure.

Spray forming of gamma titanium aluminides had been investigated experimentally and numerically. Three different nominal compositions had been successfully spray formed. The microstructure of spray formed Ti-47Al consists of fine, equiaxed fully lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif"> structure, with an average linear grain size of 60 &#181;m and an average interlamellar spacing of 0.3 &#181;m. These microstructural characteristics led to a higher creep resistance, in a temperature-stress regime of 780 to 850&#176;C and 180 to 320 MPa, relative to fully lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl obtained through conventional casting + heat treatment processes. A two dimensional modeling of the momentum and thermal behavior of atomized droplets of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl predicted that the two dimensional droplet size distribution in the spray cone changes from being heterogeneous to being almost homogeneous as axial flight distance increases. The modeling results also indicated that the two dimensional distribution of the fraction solidified in the spray cone is heterogeneous. The fraction solidified in the spray at any given axial distance increases with increasing radial distance from the spray axis.

<B>COARSENING KINETICS OF SOLID PARTICLES IN THE SPRAY-FORMED ALUMINUM ALLOY PREFORMS:</B> <I>Ram B. Bhagat, </I>Maurice F. Amateau, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 30, North Antherton Street, State College, PA 16804<P>
The coarsening kinetics of solid particles in the semi-solid aluminum alloys have been reported to follow a parabolic or a cubic law. Considering the gas-dynamic nature of the spray forming process, the high-velocity impact on the substrate is most likely to cause extensive deformation of the semi-solid and even the fully solidified droplets leading to dendrite fragmentation and grain multiplication followed by homogenization and coarsening both during the solidification and subsequent cooling until the temperature falls to a low value. In this investigation, we have developed a growth kinetics relationship based on our experimental results of the heat treatment of select spray-formed aluminum alloys. The calculated rate constant (as a function of temperature) is used in conjunction with a two-dimensional finite element analysis for transient heat transfer to determine the growth of a solid particle in the semi-solid state at any time. The results of this study are useful in understanding the kinetics of grain growth and in obtaining equiaxed, fine-grained microstructures in the aluminum alloys.

A thermodynamic analysis is performed of the effects of segregation and grain boundary structure on grain boundary free energy in metallic solids. This leads to a definition of the reduction in grain boundary free energy caused by a given level of segregant. In turn this allows the prediction of grain boundary fracture strength assuming a ductile material intergranular fracture mechanism as proposed by McMahon and Vitek. The net result is that intergranular fracture strengths can be predicted as a function of the segregation patterns existing for the material's specific thermal history, the grain boundary sigma value, and the interplanar spacing on the boundary plane. A knowledge of the binding energy of the segregant atoms to the boundary is required but this is shown to be calculable on the basis of atomic misfits for metallic lattices. The results are compared with available data from Lim and Watanabe on GB fracture in Al-Sn-Zn materials.

THE ROLE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY ARBON FILMS IN THE RATE-DEPENDENT, INTERGRANULAR FRACTURE OF NICKEL-COPPER</B>: <I>MarjorieAnn E. Natishan</I>, Matthew Wagonhoffer, Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742<P>
As part of an ongoing investigation to bound the service conditions of intergranular failure in nickel-copper alloy K-500 containing grain boundary precipitates of carbon, previously tested stress-rupture specimens were examined to document and characterize the deformation associated with grain boundary failures. Of particular interest was defining the role of the grain boundary carbon precipitates in the rate-dependent intergranular fracture process under ambient conditions. The failed creep/stress rupture specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the fracture surface and prepared for optical and electron microscopy of the microstructure adjacent to the primary fracture. High resolution microscopy revealed voids opened along the grain boundaries at carbon precipitate/nickel grain boundary interfaces. It is postulated that voids nucleate along these interfaces due to the combined driving force of the applied local stress resulting from dislocation accumulation at grain boundary/carbon interfaces and vacancy diffusion to these high energy sites. The intergranular failure then results from crack propagation along intergranular paths weakened by void formation.

<P>
High Mg content (&gt;5%) Al-Mg alloys are known to cause edge cracking during the hot working. We investigated one possible explanation, that Mg segregation to grain-boundaries can embrittle them. The extent of Mg segregation to a wide variety of grain-boundaries in Al alloys with 10% Mg is determined with the EAM. These results are consistent with our previous surface segregation studies, which are consistent with experimental studies of surface segregation. The Griffith ideal work of fracture is determined by rigidly cleaving both pure Al and Al-Mg alloys; the presence of 20-40% Mg at interface is found to lower the work of adhesion by 10%. Segregation of Mg to surface (for slow fracture, i.e., below the threshold for catastrophic failure) suggests a further reduction of 20% in the work of adhesion. Dynamic studies of fracture are also carried out with Molecular Dynamics, to determine the effect of plastic deformation.

Molecular-dynamics simulations have been used to synthesize and characterize fully dense, three-dimensional, &quot;relaxed&quot; nanocrystalline fcc metals and silicon. The high-energy grain boundaries in these nanocrystalline materials are found to be highly disordered. In the case of silicon the structures of the highly-constrained grain boundaries, triple lines and point grain junctions were found to be highly disordered and similar to the structure of amorphous silicon. Computer simulations of the behavior of an idealized model nanocrystalline material expose important parallels that exist in the dynamical properties of nanocrystalline materials and glasses. Both types of heavily disordered, metastable microstructures exhibit low- and high-frequency lattice-vibrational modes not seen in the perfect crystal, giving rise to similar thermodynamic properties at low temperatures, most notably a pronounced anomaly in their specific heats and a free-energy based phase transition from the nanocrystalline state to the glass below a critical grain size. Based on a free-energy argument, we suggest that below a critical grain size nanocrystalline materials should be unstable with respect to the amorphous phase.

An investigation of the effect of grain boundary character in the Ni-base superalloy Rene 88DT on environmentally assisted crack propagation in high temperature, gaseous environments will be presented. When tested at elevated temperature under hold time fatigue or sustained loading conditions in gaseous environment, crack propagation can occur intergranularly in this alloy, and hence may be influenced by grain boundary character. Automated microanalytical techniques have been applied to the crack tip area, with the intent of determining whether intergranular cracking occurs more readily along certain types of grain boundaries.

DYNAMIC EMBRITTLEMENT IN BERYLLIUM-STRENGTHENED COPPER:</B> <I>Ranjani C. Muthiah</I>, C.J. McMahon, Jr., University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Amitava Guha, Brush Wellman Inc., Cleveland, OH<P>
Dynamic embrittlement refers to the quasi-static diffusion-controlled decohesion, usually along grain boundaries, that can occur when a high-strength alloy is stressed in the presence of surface-absorbed impurities. Oxygen-induced cracking of nickel-based alloys at high temperatures (relevant to gas turbine engines) is thought to be an example of this phenomenon. A precipitation-hardened Cu-0.26%Be, which can be heat-treated to a wide range of strengths, is being used as a low-temperature model material for dynamic embrittlement. This alloy was found to be resistant to cracking at 200&#176;C in an inert atmosphere but was highly susceptible to grain boundary cracking in air. Preliminary tests indicate that the failure time is highly stress-dependent, but there is an incubation time for the cracking, presumably related to crack nucleation. Crack growth rate studies are being done to eliminate the effect of the variable nucleation time. The oxygen partial pressure and yield strength dependence of the cracking mechanism are also being studied.

The results of fully atomistic simulations of grain-boundary fracture are presented. Microcracks were placed in the interface plane of symmetric-tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) for an fcc system described by a smoothed Lennard-Jones potential uniaxially loaded in pure mode-I. Proper treatment of boundary conditions was ensured, as demonstrated by the good agreement of crack propagation energy and stress fields with the continuum-elasticity solutions for the bulk reference crystal. The ductile vs. Brittle response of different STGBs was investigated as a function of the grain-boundary structure. A directional toughness effect was observed and compared to available experimental data and continuum-elasticity-based theoretical treatments. Extensive comparison with the Peierls-Nabaro-Rice model of dislocation nucleation from a crack tip was carried out, showing that some of the assumptions of the model need to be reconsidered in the case of interfacial fracture. *Word of FC was partly supported by Italian National Research Council (CNR), grant AI93.02171.11.

Two distinct processes have been used to produce in situ reactions in aluminium in order to form composites with varying amounts and types of additive. The first involves fluoride salt reactions which result in the production of TiB2 particulate finely distributed in a wide range of aluminium base alloys (both cast and wrought). The particulate concentration is limited to about 12 vol% before problems of inclusion entrapment and porosity become evident. Brief details of the process and properties after conventional and pressure die casting will be reported. The second process uses a self-propagating high temperature synthesis reaction to make carbides, nitrides, borides or mixtures. A particular reaction to be reported will be for A1+TiC.

The prime objective of the work is to allow conventional pressing and sintering to be employed for making high strength structurally sound powder metallurgy components.

THERMOMECHANICAL STUDY IN COMBUSTION SYNTHESIZED Ti-Ni SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY:</B> F.M.H. Zarandi, K. Sadrnezhaad, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran 11365-9466<P>
The thermal explosion mode of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, by which time and energy can be saved and the cast product has the least interstitial contamination and high homogeneity, is used to successfully producing Ti-Ni shape memory alloys. The specimens, after hot and cold rolling, are solution treated and aged. The Rhombohedral(R)-phase transformation is observed in the Ti-50.03 at%Ni alloy. MS(1) and TR(2) have their maximums at aging temperatures of 773 and 723 k, respectively, and rise with Ni-contents. The rate of rising of TR, in aged specimens, depends on the composition and in the Ti-50.33 at%Ni alloy, in spite of the Ti-50.23 at%No alloy, MSis more than AS(3).After cold rolling of solution treated specimens, more than 50 percent reduction in thickness, and aging treatment the rate of variations of MSand AS versus aging temperature decreases and up to aging temperature of 723 k, TR is higher than that is in the not cold worked specimens. Also variations of MSwith amount of old working strains does not show uniform behaviour. All Round Shape Memory Effect occurs completely in the Ti-50.33 at%Ni alloy. 1: Start temperature of martensitic transformation; 2: Start temperature of R-phase transformation; 3: Start temperature of reverse martensitic transformation.

STRUCTURAL METAL FOAMS FROM BONDED ALUMINIUM ALLOY HOLLOW SPHERES:</B> N.E. Naxter, J.K. Cochran, T.H. Sanders Jr., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0245<P>
The demand for ultra low density structural materials that are economical is increasing. The feasibility of bonding monosized hollow spheres at points of contact to fabricate net-shaped foams with isotropic properties has been demonstrated. Currently, research efforts are focusing on adapting existing technology developed at Georgia Tech to fabricated low density hollow metal spheres. Spheres are fabricated directly from the melt using a coaxial nozzle process. Molten aluminium is injected through the outer orifice of the nozzle with gas passing through the centre orifice. As instabilities form on the liquid jet, surface tension serves to pinch off hollow monosized spheres Parameters such as melt and nozzle temperature, liquid and gas flow rates, and temperature gradient of the drop zone are controlled. As in-depth study relating sphere cooling rates to microstructural evolution and corresponding mechanical properties has been undertaken and the results of these investigations will be the subject of this presentation.

EFFECT OF THE FABRICATION METHOD ON THE AGING BEHAVIOR OF 6061 Al COMPOSITES REINFORCED WITH 20 VOL% SiC WHISKERS:</B> S. Ryu1, Y. Choi2, S.S. Cho3, H. Kwon3, S.I. Hong4, 1Tongyang Nylon Co. Ltd., Ulsari  Kyungnam, Korea; 2Sunmoon Univ., Asari, Chungnam, Korea; 3Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea; 4Chungnam National University, Taedok Science Town, Taejon, Korea
<P>
Age hardening behaviors of SiC whisker reinforced composites with 6061 Al matrix fabricated by powder metallurgy and squeeze casting were investigated to examine the effect of the fabrication method on the aging kinetics. In squeeze cast composite, numerous triangular particles which is believed to be MgAl2O4 were observed at Al/SiC interfaces whereas no visible interface particles were observed in P.M. composites. P.M. composites showed faster age hardening and reached the maximum hardness earlier than in squeeze cast composites. The decrease of the aging kinetics in squeeze cast 6061 Al matrix composites compared to that in P.M. composites is thought to result from more severe depletion of Mg atoms due to interfacial reactions in squeeze cast composites. The uniformity of whisker distribution is suggested to influence the general aging behavior through its effect on the local dislocation density. Data on the aging kinetics and the interfacial reactions in other Al alloys were also examined to study various factors which can influence the aging kinetics.

SOLIDIFICATION BEHAVIOURS AND POWDER MAKING MECHANISMS OF THE EMULSIFIED METALLIC POWDERS:</B> Chang-ki Min, Kyong-tae Nam, <I>Woo-young Yoon</I>, RASOM, Dept. of Metallurgical Engineering, Korea University, 1,5 Ka, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-ku, Seoul, 136-701, Korea
<P>
New metallic powder making processes, named &quot;Centrifugal Emulsification Process (CEP)&quot; and &quot;Mixer and Settler (MS)&quot; have been developed to synthesize rapid solidified metallic powders. The underlying principle of CEP and mS was to emulsificate the liquid metals with inorganic oil (or salt) using centrifugal force. Through CEP and mS processings, the high temperature metals as well as the low temperature alloys are fabricated. The mean particle size and size distribution could be controlled by various processing parameters that could be managed easily. The morphology of the particles could also be customized using spherodization vs. Solidification time ratio in CEP. The powder formation mechanisms in CEP and MS were rationalised through the energy balance between the input energy by centrifugal force and the increment of total surface energy of metallic liquids. The calculated mean size of powders agrees relatively well with that of the experiments. Also, the effects of rapid solidification undercooling, solidification rate and crystallisation behaviours can be evaluated effectively through the processes. The possibility of the customised not only size and morphology control but microstructure control was also shown. Both of the new methods can be applied to continuous powder making processes without oxygen contamination.

Ti-6A1-4V HOLLOW SPHERE FOAMS:</B> <I>C. Uslu</I>, J.K. Cochran, K.J. Lee* and T.H. Sanders, Jr, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0245: *Ceramic Fillers, Inc., Atlanta, GA 30318<P>
Structural foams, formed to near-net-shape by bonding monoxides hollow metal spheres at points of contact, offer the possibility of strong, light-weight, reasonably priced materials. The technology of making titanium hollow sphere foams has been developed using the coaxial nozzle powder slurry technique. Titanium hydride hollow powder spheres of 3 mm diameter and 20 mm wall thickness were fabricated from a high solids content acetone slurry. The powder shells were controlled atmosphere sintered and point contact bonded using the initial alloy hydride powder to form hollow sphere foams that were 20% of theoretical density. The sphere wall microstructures obtained by pressureless, solid-state sintering of the hydride alloy were compared to the conventional alloy microstructures and quantitative measures of sintering kinetics were established. Initial mechanical properties such as compressive yield strength and modulus will also be considered.

METAL FOAMS FROM FUGITIVE BURNOUT:</B> <I>A.R. Nagel</I>, J.K. Cochran, T.H. Sanders, Jr, K.J. Lee*; MSE-Georgia Institute of Tech Atlanta GA, 30332-0253; Ceramic Fillers Inc., Atlanta, GA<P>
Metallic foams are being made from powders using naturally occurring organic fugitive burnout material. Most forms are fabricated by introducing pores from a gas phase into a liquid system. This tends to produce pores of irregular cell size due to pore coalescence. The object of this effort is to introduce porosity utilising a fugitive solid phase to allow greater precision in forming pore systems. The foams being investigated are nickel and titanium alloys formed from slurries with starches as the fugitive materials. Starches are inexpensive and clean burning sacrificial materials. Because replication of fugitive starches requires fine particle size powders, brittle precursor powders (i.e. metal hydrides or oxides) are initially used to form the foam and subsequently decomposed or reduced to form metallic foams. Using particle packing and theological theories, the percolation value of closed cell porosity should be increased, and the microstructure of the foam should be made more uniform. Porosity and mechanical properties are being characterised for comparison to other forma geometries.

MODELING AND CONSOLIDATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE ALUMINUM:</B> J.S. Idasetima, R.B. Bhagat, M.F. Amateau, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, Box 30, New ARL Building, State College, PA 16804
<P>
The consolidation of nanograined powder metals presents a major problem of grain growth to micrometer size thereby lowering the potential benefits expected of the nanocrystalline microstructures. The aim of this investigation is two fold: (a) to present our results of consolidating nanograined alumium powder in conjunction with process modeling using Ashby's HIP program. The preliminary modeling results suggest that the nanograined aluminum powder can be consolidated into full density with minimal grain growth without using any grain growth inhibitor by optimizing combined sintering and vacuum hot pressing. The predicted hot pressing temperature for aluminum nanopowders (20-200 nm) ranges from 300 to 400 K for a fixed pressure of 19 MPa; time being less than 10 minutes. Boundary diffusion mechanisms dominate in both stage 1 and stage 2 of the densification. The as-received nonograined powder and the fabricated specimens have been characterized by optical, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis. Density and microhardness of the consolidated specimens are also reported and discussed.

COMMERCIAL PROCESSING OF METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> W.C. Harrigan, Jr., Alyn Corporation, P.O. Box 16249, Irvine, CA 92623
<P>
Discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites are a class of materials that exhibit a blending of properties of the reinforcement and the matrix. The reinforcement can be ultrahigh strength whiskers, short or chopped fibers or particles. Each of the reinforcements have property or cost attributes which dictates use in a given situation. Commercial producers have concentrated on composites with particles because of cost issues. These composites have been made by a number of manufacturing techniques. These include powder metallurgy, casting and spray deposition. The technique that has consistently produced high property composites has been powder metallurgy. Recent work in this area has been on refining techniques that offer lower cost manufacturing. Scale-up of facilities to produce vacuum hot pressed composite billets has been completed with the help of DOD funds through a Defense Procurement Act Title 3 program. Several companies have been working with a CIP-Sinter process to produce lower cost billet stock. This talk will review the recent cost reduction programs and the implications of these programs on the commercialization of these composites.

SYNTHESIS AND MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF NiAl-Al2O3 FUNCTIONALLY GRADIENT COMPOSITE:</B> D. Padmavardhani, A. Gomez, R. Abbaschian
<P>
Reactive Hot Compaction of Ni and Al powders in which one or both of the powders were preoxidized was carried out to fabricate functionally gradient composite (FGC) of NiAl with in-situ Al2O3  reinforcement. The FGC consisted of five layers with a variation of alumina content from less than 4% on one side to about 52% on the other. The gradient in the composition was obtained by stacking different powder mixtures of desired compositions. The alumina formed a continuous network around the NiAl during the compaction process. The effects of powder oxidation and heating rate on the formation of NiAl, Al3Ni and Al3Ni2 will be discussed on the basis of the DTA and microstructural studies.

POWDER METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES: SELECTION AND PROCESSING:</B> M.J. Tan and Zhang Xi, School of Mech. &amp; Prod. Eng., Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263
<P>
There has been growing interest in the last decade in the development of metal-matrix composites (MMCs) for the aerospace industries because of their attractive physical and mechanical properties, and enhanced elevated temperature capabilities. However, some of the fabrication techniques (e.g. using powder metallurgy) for this new class of MMCs are hampered by (i) the poor distribution of the reinforcements, and (ii) the limited room temperature ductility of the composites and hence formability. This presentation reports work done to address the above two problems by (i) an analysis based on size difference of matrix and reinforcement particles, taking into account the processing parameters, and (ii) introducing an innovative way of extruding brittle composites to increase its formability. By mainly considering the size difference effect of matrix powder and reinforcement particle, a critical value of reinforcement size is proposed to predict whether a uniform distribution of reinforcement is possible in powder metallurgy of particulate reinforced metal matrix composites. A uniform distribution of reinforcement could be expected only when the reinforcement size dT is not less than a critical value dC which is a function of reinforcement size dr and volume fraction Vf and reduction ratio of secondary processing, R. In extrusion, a <I>Front Pad Extrusion Method</I> was used to avoid fir-tree cracking on the surfaces of extrudates, especially the brittle metal composites. By this method, the MMCs were successfully extruded without any surface cracking, and all the extrudates were found to be covered by a thin layer of the pad material. This was illustrated using a schematic flow pattern of the extrudate and pad material in the dead metal zone during extrusion. Furthermore, decreased pressure requirements were necessary for extrusions using the front pad extrusion method.

Nanocrystalline composites of copper metal and cuprous oxide were produced at room temperature by electrodeposition from an alkaline copper lactate solution. The phase composition can be continuously changed by controlling the cathode current density. At current densities below 0.1 mA/cm2 nearly pure cuprous oxide is produced and at 2.5 mA/cm2 nearly pure copper is produced. At intermediate current densities composite structures are formed. These thin films show unique optical properties that are related to the 10 to 20 nm grain diameter of Cu2O produced by electrodeposition. During deposition of the composite material the electrode potential oscillates spontaneously at fixed current density. Microstructural information obtained by TEM indicates the formation of a metastable compound that may be related to the electrode potential oscillations. This work has been funded in part by the National Science Foundation under contract DMR-92-02872.

Spatially Varied Interfaces is a design concept for composite synthesis whereby the interface mechanical response is tailored to the composite needs by varying the interface properties in patterns of weak and strong areas. In the SiCf/Ti-alloy system, random patterns have been fabricated, along with bands, longitudinal stripes and helices. To be presented are results of transverse tensile and longitudinal fatigue crack growth experiments where selected regions of the interface are systematically strengthened or weakened, and the perturbation of the failure process is measured to gain a better understanding of the stress states and interface failure mechanisms. This work was conducted in the Metals &amp; Ceramics Division of the Materials Directorate at Wright Laboratory.

<P>
Al-based composite materials which were produced by Powder Metallurgy (PM) and Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS) are presented in this article. The objective was to produce materials with low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), tailored to approach that of steel (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approxeq-cong.gif">13x10-6 K-1), and to improve the mechanical properties of the matrix. Composite materials based on Al are used in different fields where weight and thermal stability are key requirements, such as aerospace components, electronic packaging, high precision instrumentation, and automobile engine components. The nature, size and the relative quantities of the different reinforcing phases were considered in calculations involving the optimization of the main characteristics of the composites. Fine dispersed powders (5-20 &#181;m) of Si3N4, AlN, TiB2, Al2O3, 2Al2O3&#183;2SiO2, B4C and SiC were used as the strengthening phases, while pure Al, 6061 and Al-Si alloy were used as the matrix. The dimensional and relaxation stability were investigated for several composites. The influence of plastic deformation and heat treatment on the structure and properties of VPS deposited composites were also investigated. It was found that a combination of plastic deformation and heat treatment (annealing or quenching with aging) increased the mechanical properties, on average, by a factor of 1.5 to 2.

EFFECT OF MICROSTRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENT ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Ni/a-Al2O3 METAL-CERAMIC COMPOSITES:</B> <I>E.D. Rodeghiero, </I>E.P. Giannelis, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-1501
<P>
The degree to which a ductile metallic phase can be used to toughen brittle ceramic materials is highly dependent on the microstructural dispersion of the metallic constituent, the metal's aspect ratio and characteristic size, and the amount of constraint imposed on the metal by the ceramic matrix. This talk will focus on the effect of these parameters on the mechanical properties, and in particular the fracture toughness, of Ni/a-Al2O3 composites prepared through both in-situ and conventional approaches. The composites discussed will vary from particulate toughened cermets prepared from chemical and/or powder approaches to complex, anisotropic materials containing Ni foils or fibers. Through evaluation of the experimental evidence and theoretical models, the optimum microstructural arrangement of the Ni phase in the a-Al2O3 matrix will be presented.

This study is part of an overall effort to optimize the strength toughness combination in discontinuously reinforced aluminum (DRA) composites for application in aerospace structures. Two different matrix alloys were considered, namely Al-2009 and Al-7091, to represent intermediate and high strength matrices, respectively, and they were reinforced with SiC particles of 4.9 and 10.4 mm. The powders were consolidated directly via blind-die extrusion, thus reducing processing time significantly from conventional vacuum hot pressing techniques. Fracture toughness tests were performed with precracked bend bars, and the J-resistance curves were determined. Damage modes were evaluated in both tensile and fracture toughness samples, in an attempt to understand the factors that may provide intrinsic toughness improvement without significant loss of strength. The mechanical properties and damage modes were compared with control samples of unreinforced materials fabricated using an identical processing route as the composites. Data from these control materials provided an added insight that has often lacked in past frac ture toughness studies.

APPLICATIONS OF NEW STABILITY CRITERIA TO INDUSTRIAL CELL DESIGN:</B> <I>R.I. Lindsay</I>, P.A. Davidson, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, UK
<P>
Previous models of the behaviour of interfacial waves in aluminium reduction cells lead to distinct descriptions of the physical mechanisms involved and different stability criteria. We consider the implications of these criteria for cell design. A new wave equation has recently been developed from shallow-water theory, in which the Lorentz force is expressed explicitly in terms of the fluid motion. The simplicity of this new equation leads to a general energy criterion to establish which types of motion may be unstable. By expressing the new equation in matrix form, we obtain some unexpected results. We discuss the implications of some of these results for cell design. Finally, we introduce a new sufficient condition for the stability of standing waves in a finite domain, which does not require solving the governing equations. The use of Gershgorin's theorem allows us to place a lower bound on the critical value of the background magnetic field at which an instability first appears.

MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT OF ANODE SET PATTERN ON CELL PERFORMANCE</B>: <I>M. Segatz,</I> Ch. Droste, D. Vogelsang, VAW Aluminium-Technologie, G.-v.-Boeselager-Str. 25, D-53117 Bonn, Germany
<P>
Numerical simulation of coupled bath/metal magnetohydrodynamics (MIID) and MIID stability analysis allows the optimization of anode set pattern with respect to minimal cell disturbance. The contribution of anode gas induced forces and impact on the flow field are discussed. During a complete anode set cycle the anode current distribution changes significantly due to varying anode resistances, frozen bath and different metal pad heights. Typically the largest disturbance to cell stability occurs during a short time span after the anode change. With steady-state MIID simulations immediately before and after each anode change - in sequence of the underlying set pattern - the relevant cell current and ACD distribution are determined. The impact of these parameters on cell stability is predicted with a linear MIID stability analysis for a complete anode change cycle.

A NEW MODEL OF INTERFACIAL WAVES IN ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>P.A. Davidson</I>, R.I. Lindsay, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, U.K.
<P>
We develop a new wave equation for the liquid interface in aluminium reduction cells. It differs from previous models in that the Lorentz force is expressed explicitly in terms of the fluid motion. The equation is valid both for open domains and confined domains of arbitrary shape, and its simplicity makes the instability mechanism explicit. Our new equation predicts that both travelling waves and standing waves may become unstable by the same mecha nism and that the travelling wave instabilities are distinct to those uncovered in previous investigations. We also derive a simple yet general energy criterion which shows which types of motion may extract energy from the background magnetic field.

A comprehensive program (ARC/Dynamic) was developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of aluminium reduction cells during operation. The program uses the mass and energy balance equations to determine the transient evolution of more than 60 process variables. In addition, it simulates various operational and control policies in use during cell operation. This paper describes the use of ARC/Dynamic to study the sensitivity of the cell response to variations in the input parameters. It also looks at the cell performance under various amperage curtailment conditions such as sudden shutdown of the line or scheduled reduction in line amperage. A detailed description of the amperage fluctuation model implemented in the program is presented.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF CURRENT DISTRIBUTION AND ANODE SHAPE IN PREBAKE ALUMINIUM CELLS</B>: J. Zoric, I. Rousar, Department of Inorganic Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, 16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic; <I>J. Thonstad,</I> Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Two approaches were used to determine the current distribution in aluminium cells with prebaked anodes, i.e., primary and secondary current distribution, the latter giving far more realistic results. Current densities obtained for secondary current distribution were used to model the changes in anode shape from the time when a new anode has been set until it achieves the typical rounded off steady state profile. Mathematical modelling of the anode consumption using current densities obtained by the solution of the Laplace equation in 2D space, showed that a constant shape was reached after 6 - 8.6 days, depending on the width of the gap to a neighbouring anode or to the sidewall/sideledge. The calculated steady state shapes were similar to the shapes of anodes taken out of a cell. The current density decreases up along the side of the anode from the nominal value at the underside (0.75 A cm-2) to a minimum near the surface of the electrolyte (0.08 - 0.28 A cm-2), depending on the geometry. The percentage of the current which passes through the sides of the anodes is of the order of 15%. The current density on the anode side facing the periferic channel increases with increasing distance to the sideledge, while the exact shape of the ledge makes little difference. The cathodic current density in the periferic channel goes down to 0.07 A cm-2 for a 30 cm wide channel.

<P>
Many methods are available to preheat and bake-out the cathodes of aluminium reduction cells but only few of them are widely used. Resistor coke bed with shunt rheostat is one of the most common methods to preheat the cell. To get optimum design parameters for resistance elements and preheating method, a finite element model was built to simulate the process. The effect of starting current, coke bed thickness, rate of increase of current and finally total time needed for preheating, were studied. The obtained results indicated that the practical technique used has to be subjected to some modifications in order to reach satisfactory conditions.

<P>
A hierarchical intelligent control system for aluminium reduction cells has been developed. There are two intelligent levels in the system. The higher level built on the principle of neural network expert system, aims at analyzing medium and long-term change trends of the state of the process, calculating settings for the lower level, interacting with operators and offering operation proposals. The lower level, composed of several subsystems which are set up on the principle of fuzzy control and expert control, is used to realize short-term analyses and real-time control of the process. As the system has a hierarchical and modular structure, its design, realization and testing are simplified. Test-run results verified that, combined together in one system, the controllers have good properties of robustness and adaptability with respect to changes of operating conditions and severe disturbances.

<P>
The Alusuisse ISAL smelter in Iceland does not have an in house anode plant. This makes it increasingly important to operate with small and evenly thick anode butts. Since the insertion height is calculated according to the carbon burning rate, it is important to know the difference in metal level according to the position in the pots. Two methods have been used to determine the metal upheaval. The first consists in measuring the height of many enough anode butts since the lower anode level adjusts to the metal level with time. The second method is based on mathematical modelling. Measured values have been compared to calculated values with good agreement. Insertion of the anodes according to metal level has resulted in improved gross anode consumption due to more even butt thickness and stable operation. <P>

A NEW CASTING DEFECT HEALING TECHNOLOGY:</B> Edwin S. Hodge, Thomas W. Reddoch, Format Industries, Inc., Knoxville, TN; Srinath Viswanathan, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN
<P>
A new technology is presented for healing of defects in 356 and 201 Aluminum alloys that provides economic upgrading of these cast alloys. This technology uses pneumatic isostatic forging (PIF) to provide a unique capability to produce high quality Aluminum alloy products with enhanced mechanical properties that are uniform throughout the part thus permitting higher design allowables and increased usage of Aluminum alloy castings. The fundamental mechanism underlying PIF is a single mode plastic deformation process that uses isostatic application of pressures for 10 to 30 seconds at temperature. The process can be integrated in-line with other production operations, i.e., using the latent heat from the previous casting step. The results of applying the PIF process indicate lower cost and significant improvement in me chanical properties that rival and often exceed corresponding properties of other technologies like hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and related processes. This process offers many advantages that will be described in the paper in addition to presenting case histories of property enhancement by PIF, and the mechanism for responsible property enhancement.

<P>
Plate castings of 319 alloy were made over a wide range of thermal conditions by casting in sand molds, molds with end chills, and molds with top, bottom, and end chills. The plates were sectioned along their width into coupons. Odd-numbered coupons were machined into tensile specimens and tested in the as-cast condition. Even-numbered coupons were heat treated to a T6 condition, and then machined and tested. Yield strength, Ultimate tensile strength, and ductility measured by percent elongation were plotted with respect to distance from the chill end of the plate as well as related to porosity and other microstructural features such as dendrite cell spacing. The data shows that tensile elongation is a strong function of porosity. In particular, the data indicates a threshold value of porosity below which a sharp increase in ductility is observed. These effects as well as the effect of heat treatment and dendrite arm spacing are discussed. *Research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy Defense Programs, Assistant Secretary, Technology Management Group, Technology Transfer Initiative under contract DE-AC05-96OR22464 with Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SQUEEZE CASTING OF MAGNESIUM ALLOYS AND THEIR COMPOSITES</B>: Henry Hu, Alan Luo, Institute of Magnesium Technology (ITM, Inc., SteFoy, Quebec, Canada GIP 4N7
<P>
Squeeze casting, also known as liquid metal forging, extrusion casting and pressure crystallization, is a process in which molten metal solidifies in a die under an applied high pressure. The concept of squeeze casting was invented in Russia over 100 years ago. Later the process has been exploited in North America, Japan and Europe to produce various automotive components. With the rapid expansion of magnesium applications in the automotive industry, the development of squeeze casting technology for magnesium alloys and their composites has been motivated by incentive to produce high quality magnesium-based components. The present paper reviews recent progress in squeeze casting of magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites. The effects of process variables on the cast structure and properties of magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites are discussed. The significant advantages of squeeze cast magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites are highlighted. The ongoing research work at ITM is presented.

CAST ALUMINUMFLY ASH COMPOSITES FOR ULTRALIGHT AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATION</B>: P.K. Rohatgi, R.Q. GUO, Department of Materials, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53211
<P>
Coal fly ash, an industrial waste by-product, is produced during combustion of coal by thermal power plants. Additions of solid or hollow particles of fly ash into aluminum melt by common foundry techniques reduce the cost and density of aluminum castings while increasing their performance. Fly ash particles are very light materials with density around 2.1 to 2.3 g/cm3 for solid fly ash particles and a density as low as 0.4 to 0.8 g/cm3 for the cenospheres of fly ash which are hollow. In this paper, manufacture and some properties of aluminum-fly ash composites (Ashalloy) have been studied. Aluminum alloy-fly ash (Ashalloy) represents a candidate ultralight material for automotive application. Incorporation of cenosphere fly ash particles, which are hollow with very low density, significantly reduces the density of material. Some of the characteristics of fly ash used for making composite have been described. The fly ash particle shape, size, and density have been determined. Mechanical properties of aluminum alloy - fly ash composites made by stir casting show that the composites have similar hardness, elastic modulus as matrix aluminum alloy, and improved wear abrasive resistance compared to the matrix alloy. Several prototype components of aluminum - fly ash composites for automotive applications, small engine and electromechanical machinery have been made and are under trials.

EFFECT OF SECTION THICKNESS AND GATE VELOCITY ON EVOLVED MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF HIGH PRESSURE DIE CAST MAGNESIUM ALLOY AZ91D: </B><I>Dr. Rodrick Esdaile</I>, Technical Director, Austrailian Trade Commission (Austrade), Gordon L.

Murray, CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology, Preston, Vic 3072, Australia
<P>
This paper investigates the change that occurs in microstructure and mechanical properties when the section thickness is varied for high pressure die cast Mg alloy AZ9lD. It has been found that yield and ultimate tensile strength increase more than would be expected with decreasing section thickness. This is explained in light of the fine microstructure in the surface layer (skin) that develops during the rapid solidification that occurs in this process. The two stage solidification sequence which leads to the evolution of the unique microstructure in die castings has been supported by evidence from solidification experiments using wedge castings and computer simulation of the shot sleeve. Two different die castings with relatively thick cross sections have been compared in terms of their porosity content and its effect on mechanical properties. Finally, the effects on mechanical properties of thick and thin specimens due to variation of casting parameters such as gate size is also discussed.

<P>
ECA (Electrically Calcined Anthracite) is the main raw material for the carbon part of the electrolysis cells. Demand for increased potlife and more efficient cathodes (lower voltage drop) have led to use of more graphite in the carbon materials. Little has been done to improve the main raw material, ECA. The characteristics of ECA can be strongly affected by calcining conditions and selection of raw anthracites. In this study, different ECA qualities were produced in full scale calciners and the effect of improved ECA quality on cathode materials studied. A lab scale test program was established to evaluate the effect on different baked properties. Important properties for improved cathode performance, like sodium resistance, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, can be effected by use of selected ECA.

HIGH PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PREPARATION OF CARBON PASTE FOR</B> <B>CATHODES AND GRAPHITE ELECTRODES</B>: <I>Berthold Hohl</I>, Machinenfabrik Gustav Eirich, D-74732 Hardheim, Federal Republic of Germany
<P>
The preparation of carbon paste for manufacture of cathodes and graphite electrodes requires the heating-up of the raw materials as well as the following mixing and cooling of the paste. In the last few years, a newly developed plant type has proved successful in practical operation. It consists mainly of an electric resistance heater and a high-performance mixer. The coke fractions are heated up to temperatures between 150-200&#176;C by the resistance heater and fed into the high-performance mixer along with liquid pitch. After completed homogenization of the components, the temperature required for the moulding is achieved with greatest accuracy by addition of water and evaporation cooling. One single machine of this type replaces 8-12 conventional batch mixers. The special merits of this process are the minimal maintenance compared to conventional techniques, the reduced energy consumption, the shortened cycle time and the considerably improved environmental protection. The plant is a closed system; dusts and steams are purified in an exhaust air decontamination plant and partially reused. The plant flexibility makes it possible to prepare carbon paste for both cathodes and graphite electrodes with exactly the same equipment by only simply changing the recipe. As an example, the latest state of the art is presented as well as the most significant operating results by means of a plant which was commissioned in 1995 at a great international manufacturer of carbon and graphite products.

The primary purpose of this study is to fully understand the role played by oxidation reactions in the degradation of carbon cathodes and furnace liners such as those used in aluminium smelting cells. While we have developed a sensitive technique for detecting oxidation at low rates, full mechanistic understanding is dependent on supplementary characterisation of the residual unreacted materials. This is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the electrode materials. This paper presents details of the application of X-ray diffraction for studying the various component materials of these composites, namely pitch, graphite and anthracite. Also presented in this paper is supporting compositional analysis of the heterogeneous carbon samples together with element maps to indicate the distribution of typical trace elements.

Using the method described previously (Light Metals, 1996) the oxidation reactions of carbon cathode materials have been characterised for onset temperature and rate of oxidation at low (less than 550&#176;C) temperatures. Combining the results of composition and structural analysis described in Part I, correlations have been made between the inherent structure of the component materials and their onset temperature and relative rates of oxidation thus explaining the preferential nature observed in the oxidation of composite samples. Using the results of polarised light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy the relationship between bulk structure of the heterogeneous samples and their oxidation reactions has been examined with important implications for the performance of these materials in service.

A bench-scale study has been conducted to determine the effects of melt temperature, alloy composition, and powdered calcium carbonate quantity on Ca contamination of molten Al-Mg alloys. Calcium carbonate powder is often used in ingot plants as a &quot;caulking&quot; material in troughs, joints, etc. to prevent molten metal leaks. Results of the study show that: (i) at melt temperatures above 1425&#176;F, calcium carbonate markedly increases the concentration of Ca in molten Al-4.5 wt% Mg alloy; (ii) Mg is required for the reaction of CaCO3 with the aluminum melt to occur; (iii) for a given quantity of calcium carbonate, within the temperature range of 1400-1550&#176;F, increase in melt temperature increases Ca contamination; (iv) for a given temperature of 1450&#176;F or 1550&#176;F and within 0.008-0.36 wt% CaCO3, increase in the quantity of calcium carbonate markedly increases both the rate of Ca contamination and the maximum concentration of Ca obtained in the melt for a 5 hour interaction period. The decomposition of calcium carbonate and the associated Ca contamination of molten Al-Mg alloy appears to be a kinetically-driven phenomenon.

<P>
Forced convection imposed by the feeding system plays an important role in the solidification of continuous casting processes. Convection modifies heat and mass transport and thus has a significant impact on the cast structure. A better understanding of the fluid dynamics promises an improvement of continuous casting processes. To investigate flow patterns and the influence of different inlet systems on cast structures a water model was designed maintaining dynamic similarity between model and real casting equipment. Sump profiles were derived from etch lines achieved from real castings. The flow patterns were studied for different metal distributors comprising horizontal, vertical, inclined spouts and diffusor bag. The effect of the different flow patterns is correlated with results of metallographic analysis. The experiments are reviewed by some aspects of numerical simulation. The results show that physical modelling remains an instructive tool to study the dynamic behaviour of transient flow phenomena.

The occurrence of feathery crystals during experimental casting trials on a level pour casting unit yields a strong relationship as well to the pouring temperature as to the governing fluid flow pattern within the liquid melt pool of the billet. Three-dimensional simulations of the coupled fluid flow and heat transfer problem during the stationary phase of the level pour casting process are used to investigate the variations of the thermal field in the liquid part of the solidifying billet. The calculated flow field patterns and temperatures are discussed in dependency of casting velocity, pouring temperature and size of pouring gate. The resulting thermal gradients in the mushy zone over the circumference of the billet are correlated to microstructure analysis of the corresponding casting trials.

The thermomechanical behaviour of open molds used for DC casting of aluminum slabs was analysed, and their design was optimized, in order to avoid thermal distorsion. The analysis used a thermomechanical finite element model, describing the mold geometry, the material properties, and the heat transfer between mold, molten metal and cooling water. The deformations observed during and after the casting were realistically reproduced, both in 3D and in 2D. The 2D model, allowing to test new designs in less than 10 minutes, was used to propose several solutions for reducing the residual distorsion of the mold. The different solutions were tested in industrial conditions at Aluminium Dunkerque, and mold distorsions were systematically measured. With the optimum choice of mold geometry and alloy, the residual distorsion was completely eliminated.

<P>
During the direct chill (DC) semi-continuous casting of aluminum alloys, the metal experiences high thermal stresses which are partially relaxed by deformation. This deformation is responsible for three main ingot distorsions: butt curl, butt swell and non-uniform rolling faces pull-in. These distortions are detrimental to the productivity of the process because they require butt sawing and more ingot scalping before rolling. On the other hand, residual stresses may induce longitudinal cracking of the cold ingots. Under pseudo steady-state conditions, i.e. after nearly one meter of casting, the solidified shell contracts towards the liquid pool (Pull-in). This contraction which amounts to about 9% at the lateral faces center is only 2% at the ingot corner. If a rectangular mold is employed, the resulting ingot is therefore concave (&quot;bone shape&quot;). To compensate for this non-uniform contraction of the ingot, the sides of the mold are designed with a convex shape, usually with three linear segments. Nevertheless, instead of producing flat rolling sheet ingots, such molds produce W-type ingot cross section. A comprehensive 3D mathematical model based upon the Abaqus software has been developed for the computation of the thermomechanical state of the solidifying strand during DC casting and subsequent cooling of rolling sheet ingots. Based upon a finite element formulation, the model determines the temperature distribution, the stresses and the associated deformations in the metal. This paper concentrates on the non-uniform contraction of the lateral faces and shows comparisons between computed and measured ingot cross-sections after complete cooling. Finally, the influence of the mold design on the final ingot cross-section is assessed and the use of an inverse method for mold design optimization is presented.

Water cooling plays an important role during DC casting. Control of the water cooling is essential for good process performance. In some cases the ability of the water cooling to remove heat limits productivity, and scrap can be generated due to variation in water cooling. The considerable work conducted to date on water cooling in DC casting is reviewed. The boiling theory is covered in a companion paper. Published measurements of cooling intensity and the affect of water cooling on the temperature distribution during casting are analysed. Various mold water system designs are discussed. The effect of variables such as water flow rate, impact velocity, composition, temperature etc are presented. Practical implications for controlling water cooling and the casting process are suggested.

<P>
High strength aluminum 7xxx alloys are susceptible to cracking during casting, and computational simulation is adapted to obtain better understanding and satisfactory control. Constitutive model of thermomechanical properties of the as-cast ingot is necessary for calculation of thermal stress developed after solidification. Considering the potential influence of precipitation, ingot properties are evaluated by a continuous cooling method, which allows controlled cooling at different rates to test temperatures of interest. The results indicate that thermomechanical behaviour of cast ingot remarkably differs from that of final wrought product. The relationship of mechanical properties are correlated with the microstructure of cast ingots.

Developing an accurate mathematical model for the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) semi-levitating and free surface problems is still in the top of attentions for many researchers working in the field of the EM casting and others near-net-shape product applications. In this paper, a 3D iterative solution based on the Boundary Element technique coupled with a heat transfer analysis is derived for modeling an electromagnetic (EM) caster producing aluminum ingot installed in the Egyptalum Company. The main objective of this work is studying the effects of the EM screen location, the cooling system strategy and the melt withdrawal speed, and the effects of the estimated electrical setting parameters on the EM caster performance and its operation stability. The numerical results show that the location of the screen as well as the melt withdrawal speed have significant effects on the stability and the shape of the formed aluminum ingot. On the other hand, changing the supply frequency from 1500 Hz up to 2500 Hz increases the total electrical power consumed but it has no significant effect on the ingot shape. Finally, measurements showing a comparable reduction of 10% in the total electrical power consumed and a stable equilibrium free surface shape are recorded as the EM caster is tested, in the company, using those concluded setting parameters. <P>

Thin coatings of Cr-Si-O are assessed for use as a resistor. The submicron thick films are sputter deposited using a working gas mixture of (1-x)Ar-(x)O2. Several sintered-compacts of metal and oxide powders are commercially prepared for use as the sputter targets. The deposition process yields a range of film compositions which consist of 2-30 at.% Cr and 20-45 at.% Si as measured using Rutherford Back Scattering. A broad range of resistance values (101 to 1014 Ohm-cm) are found as measured by point contact with metal pads deposited onto the Cr-Si-O film surface. The film structure and morphology is characterized using transmission electron microscopy from which the resistance behavior can be correlated to the distribution of metallic-Cr. Thermal aging reveals metastability in the Cr-Si-O film morpholgy and resistance behavior.

Presently, nanostructured GaN composite was prepared using a novel synthetic route. GaN nanocrystals were imbedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) thin film matrix (GaN/PMMA) and then studied from structural and optical point of views. X-ray powder diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were performed to analyze the microstructure while the optical properties were measured by optical absorption and photoluminescence. Microstructural analyses showed that the GaN nanocrystallites imbedded in the PMMA matrix have an average size of about 5.5 nm and crystallize in the zinc blende lattice (lattice constant <I>a </I>close to 0.45 nm) with some nitrogen vacancies and structural imperfections. Optical absorption measurements indicate that the band gap energy of the GaN/PMMA composite is approximately 3.51 eV.

Mechanical spectroscopy techniques have been employed to investigate the anelastic and magnetoelastic behavior of bulk nanophase Fe and Fe-Al prepared by mechanical alloying and FeCuNbSiB granular alloys obtained starting from amorphous precursors through thermal treatments. The different magnetic states of the materials lead to strong modifications of the anelasticity spectra. The experimental results are presented and discussed with specific reference to the following to aspects : a) magnetoelastic coupling and giant DE effect in the FeCuNbSiB system occurring just below the nanocrystallization temperature, b) giant modulus enhancement in bulk iron and iron-aluminum alloys linked to changes of the magnetic behavior connected to grain size reduction and interfacial structure relaxation. <P><B>10:10 am BREAK <P>10:25 am

<P>
Ultrathin (&lt;10nm) films and multilayers of granular Co-Cu composites have been prepared by co-sputtering. Nanoscale Co particles are formed in Cu by depositing on heated substrates (TS&gt;100C), with the usual increase in magnetic coercivity Hc, and superparamagnetic behavior above a critical blocking temperature (Tb) which depends on the partical size, shape, and local magnetic environment. We find that the confinement of the granular layer to thicknesses near the particle size induces variation in Hc and Tb due to changes in particle shape, magnetic anisotropy and inter-particle interactions. By varying the composition and thickness of both magnetic layer and interlayer, as well as the deposition conditions, one can identify conditions under which then magnetic granular layers can be fabricated with large anisotropy and therefore increased blocking temperature, without the need for post-deposition high-temperature processing. Such layers are designed to be used in magnetoresistive spin-valve multilayer structures.

<P>
The low-frequency internal friction behavior of mechanically milled copper and copper-30 wt% iron alloys was studied over a temperature range of 100-700&#176;K and a frequency range of approximately 1 to 3 Hz. Alloys were prepared by consolidating mechanically milled and alloyed powders using hot isostatic pressing to form compacts from which bars were machined for testing. Samples studied included unmilled copper, milled copper and milled copper-30 wt% iron. All powders were consolidated at 600&#176;C and diffracting particle size of the consolidated material varied from 18-30 nm. The internal friction studies indicated the presence of a large grain boundary peak in all samples at approximately 300&#176;C which increased with decreasing particle and grain size. The presence of iron appears to depress this peak and cause the occurrence of a second smaller high temperature peak in the range of 400-500&#176;C, which is believed to be associated with iron in solid solution. <P>

Spacecraft electronics including those at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), demand production of highly reliable assemblies. JPL has recently completed an extensive study, funded by NASA's code Q, of the interplay between manufacturing defects and reliability of ball grid array (BGA) and surface mount electronic components. More than 400 test vehicles were assembled using ceramic and plastic BGAs, LCCs, J-leads, and gull wing components. These were subjected to thermal cycle testing and solder joint defects were logged prior to testing and solder damage propagation over time was documented. These findings offer valuable information to designers and quality assurance personnel alike on package robustness as well as in better understanding the defects that can actually lead to failure.

SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY AND LIFE PREDICTIONS FOR VARIOUS SMALL OUTLINE PACKAGES MOUNTED ON FR-4 BOARDS:</B> <I>Suresh Golwalkar</I>, Timothy Rothman, Paul Boysan and Robert Surratt, Intel Corporation, 1900 Prairie City Road, Folsom, CA 95630
<P>
TSOP or Thin Small Outline Packages have gained wide spread market acceptance throughout the electronic industry. This innovative and small footprint package was designed to fill a need created by the form factor specified for use in PCMCIA standard memory cards. However, with the broad and rapidly escalating acceptance of Flash products in the marketplace, this small outline package is being considered for a multitude of other use conditions. The small form factor of TSOP and accordingly short stiff lead form construction, requires further scrutiny in certain situations - specifically, applications requiring 20+ year lifetimes or others using 60 mil thick multi-layer FR-4 PCB's subject to extreme thermal cycling. Solder joint reliability is predominantly determined by two separate factors. The first being the surface mount process itself. Without a good initial solder joint, you can not expect good solder joint reliability. This fine pitch package (0.5 mm) requires different considerations than the existing 50 mil (1.27 mm) pitch type components. IR reflow profiles, solder volumes, and land pad layouts all contribute to proper fillet formation and a defect free solder joint. One must start with a good SMT process to have reliable solder joints. Second, is the use condition itself. Package/board configuration, operation conditions and thermal cycling of the board, drive solder joint reliability. In order to determine if TSOP is the correct package for a given application, various graphical presentations of failure rate versus service life are included in this paper. Solder joint evaluations were performed using various temperature cycle conditions. Data was taken using 64 mil thick FR-4 boards of various layer count and 20 mil thick 4 layer memory cards using 32Id, 40Id TSOP and 44Id PSOP packages. Temperature cycle conditions A, B and C were performed and Weibull probability plots were developed for each condition. Acceleration factors for solder joint fatigue is given by Norris and Landsburg equations. These include frequency transformations, temperature swing transforms, and a factor for variation of isothermal fatigue characteristics of solder joints between test and operating conditions. These equations yield use condition graphs. The graphs provided, show four different operational temperature swing conditions. Express, industrial, consumer, and computer conditions are depicted according to the IPC standards for these use variables. The extreme of the temperature swing and the frequency of swings per day, modulate the solder joint reliability. We have included both temp cycle condition A and B test data and modeled projections based on those. We feel that condition A more directly simulates real life use condition. Conditions B and C were used as highly accelerated conditions to obtain (trends only) swifter, but preliminary, failure predictions. As can be seen from temp cycle A cycling data, 50% failure point takes approximately six months to complete. PSOP data has ben included for completeness. As can be observed from the data, PSOP solder joint reliability, is oustanding for any application and any temperature range.

DEFORMATION ANALYSIS ON FLIP CHIP AND CSP SOLDER INTERCONNECT BY MICRODAC:</B> D. Vogel1, J. Auersperg2, A. Schubert1, B. Michel1, H.

<P>
In order to enhance thermo-mechanical life time of solder interconnects in flip chip and CSP assemblies the design of new products is optimized by the help of Finite Element (FE) simulations. Solder stress reduction is achieved selecting proper materials and assembly geometry. Life time estimations and trends can be obtained by fatigue models, e.g. a Coffin-Manson approach, utilizing calculated stress and strain distributions. The performance of FE modeling depends on the quality of the provided input data, i.e. on load conditions, geometrical layout, constitutive material laws and on material parameters. Lacking data necessarily leads to simplifications. Consequently, comparable strain and stress measurements are requested to make FE results reliable. Often Moire deformation measurements are utilized for microelectronics purposes to obtain data for comparison with FE findings. Unfortunately, the method is faced with difficulties, if very small structures like single bumps have to be investigated and resolved. The new microDAC method applied in this work can overcome these problems. The underlying measurement principle is a correlation based computer algorithm. It allows to track local object pattern during load. A set of local patter displacements is treated to get strain and shear fields over the object surface. Until now thermal and/or mechanical load on flip chip and CSP specimens is realized inside scanning electron microscopes, as well as for optical and laser scanning microscopes. The picked up images for different load states are processed by the microDAC computer code. Measurements have been accomplished for flip chip and chip scale package solder interconnects. E.G., strains inside eutectic PBSn bumps of flip chip assemblies with highly filled underfill material have been determined by microDAC. Bump stresses were caused by the thermal mismatch between a low cost FR-4 substrate and the silicon die, heating up the assembly from room temperature. Measured deformation fields have been compared with FE results. The main strain features of FE simulation and microDAC measurement results correspond with each other. The hard underfill obstructs the shear of corner bumps. Consequently, shear strains (xy of corner bumps should not necessarily be a major reason of solder fatigue. Solder strains (xx in the perpendicular to the board direction are quite high. Their amount exceeds the value of unrestricted thermal strain of solder or underfiller material between a half and one order of magnitude. So, this strain component can significantly contribute to bump fatigue. Calculated (xx strains are at least three times lower than measured on the real component. The reason is assumed to be a anisotropic thermal expansion of the thin underfill layer. So, solder fatigue estimations only based on FE strain values can result in significantly higher life time values than realistic reached.

RELIABILITY FORMULATION FOR ELECTRONIC INTERCONNECTIONS: </B>Eugene Atwood and <I>Horatio Quintone</I>, IBM Microelectronics, B/330-81A, Route 52, East Fishkill Facility, NY 12533
<P>
This paper describes a novel reliability methodology, supported by data, which includes a rigorously derived stochastic formulation. As an introduction to this topic, the paper reviews and critiques methods currently used in the field of electronic interconnection reliability and presents supporting data illustrating the arguments set forth. Plausible physical explanations are presented for each of the factors used in the IBM modified Coffin-Manson acceleration model. The acceleration model is challenged because of its form which assumes linearly independent factors. A review of the log normal and extreme value distributions, commonly used to model system reliability of electronic interconnects, highlights deficiencies and violations of some of the basic mathematical axioms i.e., &quot;closure property&quot;. Additionally we present a refutation of &quot;theoretical derivations&quot; that have put forward to establish the validity of the log normal distribution as a model of fatigue fracture mechanisms. With regard to the main topic: today's thermal environments can no longer be defined by simple periodic functions, i.e., a fixed frequency and amplitude, but instead they tend to be &quot;highly no-periodic&quot; and of random nature. The randomness can be a result of the synergy between operating systems, software, use patterns and CMOS technology, e.g. temperature fluctuation patterns resulting from power management schemes defined in today's electronic devices. Present reliability formulations are not tailored to deal with this randomness. A rigorous formulation is presented that accounts for non-deterministic environments. The method treats the problem stochastically including the use of a novel distribution for time-to-fail, SCRIP (Statistics of Crack Initiation and Propagation) developed by the authors et al, and other system reliability formulations. An additional methodology is proposed which formulates electronic interconnection reliability in the presence of these random environments and extends the use of cycle/time based reliability assessments commonly used in the industry. The method consists of performing a series of renormalizations by discrete auto correlation and convolution integrals which are used to determine to determine the spectral power density function of the random environment.

<P>
The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the physical reasons behind what appears to be many self-contradictions encountered in solder reliability testing and experience. This is accomplished by presenting the underlying physical aspects of solder reliability, including workmanship, metallic and intermetallic bonding, interface mechanisms, diffusion, vacancy and void formation, work-hardening and softening, as well as smooth versus chaotic stress-strain behavior. Also discussed, is the criterion for successful application of finite element analyses in fatigue life calculations. It is hoped that this work will help bridge the gap between practitioners with opposing beliefs, for example those who believe in chaotic stress-strain behavior versus those who believe in smooth behavior. General guidelines for estimating the appropriate input conditions in the absence of accurate life profiles are provided. The use of the tool is demonstrated with several examples. These include: Thin Outline packages, Quad Flat packs, J-leaded components, and leadless Chip Carriers. A comparison of observed failures and calculated times to failure is provided.

Despite the studies performed in the last two decades to understand the fatigue behavior of the solder joints used in the electronic packages, the problem still draws big attention among the electronic package manufacturers. Fortunately, the studies performed provided a great improvement in the information about the behavior of the solder material under low-cycle-fatigue conditions. Based on the available information about the mechanical and fatigue behavior of solder material under thermal loads, the present authors developed the <I>volume-weighted averaging technique </I> for the fatigue life prediction of solder joints (A. Bilgic, &quot;Fatigue Life Prediction Methods for Thermally Loaded Solder Joints Using the Finite Element Method&quot;, Master of Science Thesis, Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN) and H. U. Akay, N. H. Padyar and A. Bilgic, Fatigue Life Predictions for Thermally Loaded Solder Joints Using a Volume-Weighted Averaging Technique, ASME Journal of Electronic Packaging, 1996 (in Review). The method consists of calculating the stresses and strains generated within a specific package by use of the finite element method and then correlating the calculated stress-strain response to the fatigue life by use of an energy-based fatigue life prediction criterion. The method was used to predict the fatigue lives of several arbitrary solder joints and the predictions were compared with the experimental data. The predictions were very encouraging. It is stated that the method does not differentiate between leadless and leaded solder joints or the loading applied on the packages. In addition, the method is very mesh-insensitive, implying that the number of nodes and finite elements used in the mesh has no major effect on the predictions. In this study, we extend our method to the fatigue life prediction of three-dimensional solder joints of resistors. The heating is provided by the power loading applied on the resistor. The differential thermal expansions within an assembly causes the thermal strains and stresses, as in the case in chip carriers. The analysis is performed in two steps: 1) A heat transfer analysis is performed to determine the spatial variations of temperatures during a power loading cycle; 2) Thermal stress analysis is performed to determine the thermal stresses and strains developed during the structure. The stress-strain response against the applied power loading is then used to predict the fatigue life using the previously developed <I>volume-weighted technique </I> and the fatigue life prediction criterion. The predictions are compared with the experimental data provided by others.

<P>
Void-like features have been observed on sheared surfaces on 90:10 Pb:Sn columns in ceramic cast column grid array (CCGA) packages. The feature sizes are typically 3-5 mils across. These features are not voids. They are crater-like fractures caused by the shearing tool. Shearing with a heavy tool causes extensive cratering. Shearing the columns with a razor blade produces far fewer, if any, of these void-like features. These craters are a concern since they can be mistaken for voids which affect the reliability of CCGA devices. The surface of these features are devoid of large (greater than 2-3 micron) tin-rich regions normally in the bulk of the column. The tin-rich regions have lower toughness than the Pb-rich matrix in the two-phase 90:10 Pb:Sn cast column. Cratering can be explained as a mechanism where the shearing tool creates a crack that propagates around these tin-rich regions. Micromechanical models have been established to simulate crack propagation (a) through and (b) around the tin-rich area. The results show that the energy released for case (b) is less than that of case (a) even though case (b) has a longer crack path.

A thin layer of 6.0 to 8.0 microinches (0.1 to 0.2 microns) of electroless palladium deposited directly on the copper surface of a printed wiring board has exhibited excellent solderability. This new surface offers a series of advantages over the traditional Hot Air Solder Leveling (HASL). It is flat, coplanar, which is a must for successful screen printing of fine featured devices. It is lead free and environmentally friendly. Other than being solderable it is also wire bondable and has applications as a viable surface finish for contact switching or compression contacts. Characteristics of palladium are discussed. Data of solder joint reliability is presented. The data includes an in depth EDX analysis of metallurgy of the interface between palladium coated copper pads and the solder forming the joint, under various accelerated aging conditions. The solder joint has been subjected to 2000 thermal cycles per IPC standard testing procedures. The results indicate no impairment in resistivity of solder joint integrity.

Chip Scale Packaging is one of new hot topics in electronic packaging where Chip Scale Packages are defined by size, which should be nearly chip size. Different types of CSPs have been developed. They may be classified by the technological concept, e.g. waferlevel (including molding), flip chip with interposer (rigid, flex) and the well known (BA. The mechanical reliability mainly is determined by the packaging technology. The package design has to compensate stresses caused by the thermal mismathc between its components. Different CSPs approaches were analyzed by thermomechanical Finite Element Analysis simulating a thermal cycling process with respect to the complex mechanical behavior of the different materials used, e.g. the creep effect in solder joints, the temperature dependence of material parameters, the visco elastic behavior of underfill materials. The results will be discussed from the aspect of an estimation of the mechanical reliability. Several types of SCPs with a great variety of materials used are evaluated in such a way. The sensitivity of the related values to changes of material and geometrical parameters was used to enhance the thermo-mechanical life time. Experimental methods are applied to obtain accurate input data for the FEA. The comparison of the results from FEA with those obtained from microDAC strain measurement method helps to fit the model data utilized in numerical simulations for more realistic physical models and makes the FE results reliable. This work is part of a national CSP project with partners from German industry.

It is well known that MO-Re alloys exhibit superior properties among Mo based alloys. However Re effect on the structures and properties of Mo has not well understood. The current state of Mo-Re alloys was therefore reviewed not only in the field of high temperatures but also in the application of high performance. Focusing on the effect of Re concentrations in Mo, the structures and properties of the welds produced by electron beam welding were investigated. Bend and tensile behaviors of the welds were evaluated. Microstructures and fracture surfaces of the welds were examined in details by SEM/EDX and TEM. Furthermore formation and distribution of sigma-phase in Mo-Re welds were studied. A role of signa-phase on the structures and properties of Mo-Re alloys was also discussed.

Mechanical alloying (MA) of well characterized elemental W (75 wt.%) and Re (25 wt.%) was carried out in a SPEX Mill at ambient temperature for 1,3,5 and 10 hours. Milled products were examined for structural, chemical and morphological details using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. XRD patterns showed continuous decrease in the intensity of Re peaks, with increasing MA time. However the Re peaks continued to be present even after 5 hours of milling. Ten hours of milling showed complete dissolution of Re, as observed by the complete absence of Re peaks in association with W peak shift in accordance with the dissolution of Re in W. Extensive reduction in particle size and chemical homogeneity of the alloy could be established by microstructural and chemical analysis using SEM and TEM. After pressing and sintering of pellets, tests revealed a significant amount of contamination by iron through milling.

THE KEY POINT OF TUNGSTEN-RHENIUM ALLOYS PROCESSING:</B> Ms. Song Lin, 62 Amethyst Way, Franklin Park, NJ 08823 <P>Tungsten-Rhenium alloys have won an important application in various modern technical fields and achieved great economic- technical effects and primarily produced by powder metallurgy. Nevertheless, the practical uses of tungsten-rhenium alloys sometimes are limited due to some difficulties encountered in their processing and applications. The common troubles are as follows: 1). The inhomogeneity of the alloy's composition. 2). The bubbling effect, during sintering of alloy rods. 3). Breaks occurred in winding formation of the alloy wire. 4). The formation of brittle second phases in the alloy. With the purpose to improve the properties of Tungsten Rhenium alloys.

MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF DILUTE Mo-Re ALLOY:</B> R.W. Buckman, Jr., Refractory Metals Technology, Pittsburgh, PA 15236
<P>
The creep-rupture life of unalloyed molybdenum at 0.65Tm is only increased by an order of magnitude with up to 50% Re addition. A proprietary process, developed for unalloyed molybdenum, results in an increase in creep-rupture life at 0.65Tm by 4-5 orders of magnitude. A Mo-14Re alloy processed by a similar method exhibits comparable creep rupture strength while recrystallized material retains a DBTT significantly below room temperature.

In our Institute some data were obtained that chromium-carbide eutectic cast alloys have prospects promising. The eutectic (CR)+(TiC) alloy has Vickers hardness about 100 Kg/mm2 at 1000&#176;C and is harder than traditional commercial alloys on the base of iron, cobalt or nickel in some times about 1000&#176;C. And what is more that the latter is able to be machined with the former at high temperature. Produced from (Cr)+(TiC) swages allowed to carry out isothermic swaging of high-temperature strength X<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-pi.gif">220BX alloy (the Ni-based material for vane gas-turbine engine) in air at 1150&#176;C and 200 Mpa stress. Molybdenum additions to the eutectic (Cr)+(TiC) alloy were determined to increase high temperature hardness to 1000&#176;C up to 200-300 Kg/mm2. Continuing development the effect of rhenium on the structure and high-temperature hardness of eutectic two-phases (Cr)+(TiC) alloys in Cr-Ti-C and Cr-Mo-Ti-C systems was examined in this investigation. The rhenium additions being 5, 10 and 20 at. &amp; were shown to lead to the formation of limited quantity of third phase, (Cr23C6). Highly dispersed eutectic structure became more homogeneous. According to microprobe analysis the rhenium (as molybdenum) is predominatly dissolved in chromium matrix. High-temperature hardness was determined to be increased already with 5 at.% Re additions. The develop is about 100 kg/mm2 at 300-800&#176;C and about 40 Kg/mm2 at 1000&#176;C. It became higher with increasing rhenium content up to 20 at.%. The hardness of five-component alloys was always more than four-component at the whole temperature interval. The maximum was found at maximum rhenium content (450 Kg/mm2 at 900&#176;C). to our mind the develop was achieved due to solid solution strengthening of chromium matrix (well-known &quot;rhenium effect&quot;). The determined of hardness allows to estimate the strength characteristics using the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">=HV/3 connection. Therefore the eutectic (Cr)+(TiC) alloys with rhenium alloying are believed to become more perspective for application.

The fine particle powder technology was used for the production of W-Re alloys. Single phase W-Re powders were obtained by co-reduction of fine particle W-Re oxide blends. The homogeneous disperse W-20%Re powders and the single phase W-80%Re intermetalide powder with particle size in range of 1- 4 &#181;k were synthesized. W-20%Re powder was mixed with the W powder of the same dispersion in order to obtain W-2%Re alloy. The <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-phase would not be formed during the sintering because Re in blend is in form of the prealloyed W-20%Re powder. The synthesized W-2%Re ingots were rolled in 2-3 mm sheets. The mechanical characteristics and the structure of the material were investigated. The sheets had higher plasticity due to the 2%Re alloying. The W-80%Re alloy powders were successfully used for the production of long working time impregnated cathodes.

Uzbek Refractory and Heat Resistant Metals Integrated Plant is a complex enterprise infield of manufacture tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium, and alloys on their basis. There is a special technology of imputing rhenium from molybdenum concentrates, which contains from 300 GR. to 700 GR. rhenium per each 1 ton of concentrate at the enterprise. Moly concentrates are manufactured by method of nitrogen acid imputing. In this case basic point of rhenium transferring into liquids which contains molybdenum, rhenium and nitrogen and sulfur acids. Using such types of liquids, there are well known methods such as extraction and distilled rectification methods of imputing rhenium. And all above mention of methods have low effect. That is why researching in field of sorption technology of imputing rhenium from nitrogen-sulfur liquids. Researching of wide range of low, middle and high basis of anionites determined that the best one is vanil-peridium resin. Using such type of resin in industry we achieved 80% imputing rhenium as ammonium perrenatum. There is wide range of utility possibilities now we can use our own rhenium and produce powder alloys on basis of tungsten and molybdenum. Tungsten alloys are: BP-3; BP-S; BP-20. Molybdenum alloys are: MKP-16; MP-47. Wire produced from tungsten and molybdenum alloys using in thermometry and tube building industry as they have hardest characteristics.

Existence of the rhenium effect improving the mechanical properties of the multycomponent chromium alloys (containing the rhenium and carbon together with other elements) specifies our interest in Re-Cr-C ternary system. Constitution and properties of more than 40 alloys prepared by arc melting were investigated by metallography, x-ray diffraction, microprobe and differential thermal analyses and Pirani-Altertum method in total concentration range. Rhenium raises the melting point of bcc chromium based phase (up to 2284&#176;C in binary system Re-Cr). The maximum temperature of melting for the carbon and rhenium saturated chromium in equilibria with (Cr,Re)23C6 and (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-Re3Cr2) amounts to 1650&#176;C and appear more high then melting temperature for binary alloys containing Cr and Cr23C6 phases (1581&#176;C). Ternary alloys of this two phase field have higher strength and ductility than binary ones. It is in according to data about existence rhenium effect in chromium based alloys. Essential singularity of Re-Cr-C system is immensely high combined solubility of the chromium and carbon in rhenium at high temperatures (about 50 at% Cr at 30 at% C: and 1710&#176;C) and significant solubility of rhenium in chromium carbides (the most solubility Re in Cr23C6 amounts to 18, in Cr7C3 and Cr3C2 ones do 8 and 6 at.% at, 1655, 1710 and 1760&#176;C, respectively ). Rhenium based solid solution forms equilibria with carbon, solid solutions of rhenium in chromium carbides and (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-Re3Cr2) and thus it specifies the constitution of Re-Cr-C ternary system. <P>

The anomalous effect rhenium has on the ductility of the Group VIA elements Mo, W, and Cr is not observed in the Group VA metals Ta, Nb, and V. The low temperature ductility of the Group VA elements is significantly impaired at rhenium additions greater than about 3 atom percent. However, rhenium has been shown to significantly improve the high temperature creep strength of tantalum alloys and the effect is saturated at about 1.5 atom percent rhenium, a level which does not alter the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of tantalum alloys significantly.

UNDERCOOLING EXPERIMENTS ON RHENIUM AND RHENIUM ALLOYS BY DROP-TUBE PROCESSING:</B> Bernard Vinet and Sandrine Tournier, Commissariat &aacute; l' &Eacute;nergie Atomique, DTA/CEREM-D&eacute;partement d'&Eacute;tude des Mat&eacute;riaux, 17 rue des Martyrs, 38054 Grenoble c&eacute;dex 9, France
<P>
Solidification of deeply undercooled melts can lead to the same variety of solid state metastabilities as do methods of rapid quenching of the liquid onto cold substrates. Since undercooling is realized at slow cooling rates, containerless processing is often needed to avoid external nucleation sources. In such a way, refractory materials are studied by letting single droplets fall through an evacuated high drop-tube as for instance the 48 metre high facility built in Grenoble. In this contribution, an overview is proposed on the most interesting results obtained so far for rhenium and rhenium alloys. Undercooling experiments have been realized on refractory binary alloys showing complex <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">(D8b, type CrFe, 30 atoms per cell) and X (A12, type <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-Mn, 58 atoms per cell) phases in the equilibrium phase diagram. The studied systems associate a b.c.c. (W, Ta, Mo, Nb) transition metal with a h.c.p. metal, rhenium in the event (Tc, Os and Ru should also be considered if only from a phenomenological point of view). A favoured primarily formation of the metastable bcc-structure instead of the direct formation of the stable phase is obtained in the case of the Re-W system. Moreover, a double recalescence phenomenon is obtained in a composition range between 65 and 82 at% W. This result is discussed in connection with the appearance of the metastable A15 phase. In the case of the Re-Ta system, it is shown that the% phase nucleates from the melt.

Physiko-chemical principles of rhenium alloys development are considered and examples are shown of application of these principles to the development of conventional and advanced rhenium alloys. The features of physiko-chemical interaction of rhenium with elements of Periodic table in binary, temary and more complicated alloy systems are analysed. Special attention is given to the theoretical analysis of experimental &quot;composition-property&quot; diagrams. The role of electronic structure is discussed as concerns the effect of the chemical composition on some physical and mechanical properties of Cr- Moe, or WRe-based solid solutions. The stability is estimated of solid solutions, intermetallic compounds, and interstitual phases in rhenium alloys, as well as the tendencies and rates of diffusion processes in multi component heterogenious rhenium alloys. Special rhenium effects responsible for decreasing of cold brittleness phenomena in IV group metals are discussed as well as high strain-hardening rates of W-and Mo-alloys with Re.

Particular attention is given to the authors' results on the high (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gtequalto.gif"> 4 at.%) solubility of oxygen in Mo-Re alloys, to the segregation of the interstitial on the structure defects, and to the contribution of these factors to the increase of the plasticity.

The effect of the rhenium alloying on the decrease in the mobility of screw dislocations and the contributions of the Peierls forces to the increase in plasticity are discussed. The problem of the formation of local composition irregularities with an atomic short-range order and a type A15 lattice and the relevant experimental data are considered. It is supposed that the grain bulk-to-boundary strength ratio is important for high temperature (1300 K) strength and plasticity of Mo-Re alloys to be attained.

<P>
The regularities of the phase transformations and the variation of the composition of Mo-Re-base alloys in the process of oxygen diffusion alloying were investigated. It has been found that the alloying with rhenium to a concentration of 47 wt.% increases (to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 4 at.% and more) the solubility of oxygen, reduces (by 2-3 orders) its diffusion coefficient in molybdenum, and prevents the increase in the oxygen solubility at dislocations and small-angle boundaries of the substructure and the segregated enriching of intergrain boundaries with oxygen. For the Mo-Re alloys subjected to solid-solution hardening with oxygen it has been found that the phenomenon of mechanical twinning is suppressed and the characteristics of the dislocation structure are changed on plastic deformation. Moreover, in the solid solutions of the Mo 47% Re alloys, local regions of the short-range order or type Mo3ReOx complexes with the A15 structure, stabilized as a result of the diffusion of oxygen atoms, are observed. The role played by the regularities revealed in the realization of the rhenium effect is discussed.

The connection of &quot;rhenium effect&quot; (simultaneous increase of the strength and plasticity in W, Mo, Cr by adding rhenium at a concentration close to the solubility limit) with the peculiar structural state of corresponding alloys is discussed. The hypothesis is suggested, according to which the main factor for the appearance of the rhenium effect is the formation of dispersed close packed (of Frank-Kasper type) phases such as W3Re with A15 structure or distorted <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-phase. The general problem of the appearance of dispersed Frank-Kasper phases near the instability boundary of BCC lattice in transition metal alloys is considered in the framework of a simple crystallogeometrical model. It is shown that the precipitates of the phases in BCC host may provide the increase of the solubility of interstitial impurities. The replacement of carbide phases by the precipitates of the Frank-Kasper phases may lead to the improvement of mechanical properties of the alloys.

Advantages and disadvantages of the vacuum melting and powder metallurgy processes for production of these alloys are discussed. The ways for increase in purity and improve of homogeneous distribution of rhenium in sintered PM-alloys are discussed too.

<P>
The current state of science and mechanical properties improving for Cr, Mo and W alloyed by Re (so-called &quot;rhenium effect&quot;) is reviewed. The main possibilities for increasing low-temperature plasticity of Cr, Mo and W by Re additions are closely connected with electron structure change during alloying; that is, plasticity is increased when alloying essentially changes the electron structure by disturbing the optimum conditions of the resonance covalent bond and changing the filling of energy bands. The observed growth of the density of electron states at the Fermi level N(EF) is accompanied by lowering of Peierls stress, decrease of staking fault energy ( SFE), increase of activation volume and interstitial solubility, and the involvement of an additional deformation mechanism - twinning. The increase of N(EF) should not be very sharp for SFE and interstitial solubility to have the optimum value. SFE has to be lowered so that twinning can occur, but the mobility of dislocation screw components should not be impeded. Lowering of SFE is accompanied by growth of activation volume and increase of stress relaxation rate at concentrators. The increase of interstitial solubility should be sufficient to diminish the tendency to impurity segregation on dislocations as well as on grain and subgrain boundaries, but not so great as cause the abrupt hardening of a solid solution . The experimental results devoted to the influence of Re additions on the dislocation structure, mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms are discussed. <P>

Turbine inlet temperatures over the next few years will approach 1650&#176;C (3000&#176;F) at maximum power for the latest large commercial turbofan engines, resulting in high fuel efficiency and power levels approaching 442 kN (100,000 lbs). High reliability and durability must be intrinsically designed into these turbine engines to meet extended over-water, large twin engine aircraft (ETOPS) certification requirements. This level of performance has been brought about by a combination of advances in air cooling for turbine blades and vanes, design technology for stresses and airflow, single crystal and directionally solidified casting process improvements, the development and use of rhenium (Re) containing high y' nickel-base superalloys with advanced coatings, including full-airfoil ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Re additions to cast airfoil superalloys not only improve creep and thermo-mechanical fatigue strength but also environmental properties, including coating performance. Re dramatically slows down diffusion in these alloys at high temperature turbine operation conditions. A team approach has been used to develop a family of two single crystal alloys (CMSX-4. containing 3% Re and CMSX.-10 containing 6% Re) and a directionally solidified, columnar grain alloy (CM 1 86LC. containing 3% Re) for a variety of turbine engine applications. A range of critical properties of these alloys are reviewed in relation to component turbine engineering performance through engine certification testing and service experience. Industrial turbines are now commencing to use this aero developed turbine technology in both small and large frame units in addition to aero-derivative industrial engines. These applications are demanding with high reliability required for turbine airfoils out to 25,000 hours. with perhaps greater than 50% of the time spent at maximum power. Combined cycle efficiencies of large frame industrial engines is scheduled to reach 60% in the U.S. ATS program.

The major use of Rhenium is in catalysts primarily in the petrochemical industry. However, due to increased demands in high temperature turbine applications, Re is becoming a critical alloying element primarily in nickel base, single crystal superalloys. As a member of the refractory metal family of elements, Re is a higher cost member, in pat due to the expense associated with production.

Bicrystal specimens of the alloys having 5,10 and 2Q at.% of Re were tested for impact strength at 20&#176;C, microcrack depth in the crystals and on the intercrystalline boundaries after electrodischarge treatment was studied. Disorientation angle ranges of the twist intercrystalline boundaries were 7-9&#176; and 18-21&#176;. It is shown that alloying strengthens crystals and improve their ductility. Single crystal strengthening has not monotonous nature. Minimum of hardness, ultimate strength and yield strength was observed at 3-4 at.% of Re. The alloying decreases microcrack depth after electrodischarge treatment both in crystals and on the intercrvstalline boundaries however the depth of the last ones is always more.

THE RHENIUM IMPACT ON THE MASS TRANSFER IN Mo-Re SINGLE CRYSTALS UNDER SHOCK LOADING:</B> S.V. Divinski, L.N. Larikov, M.N. Belyakova, V.V. Zholud, V.F. Mazanko, Institute of Metal Physics, National Academy of Sciences, 36 Vernadsky Str., Kiev-142, 252142, Ukraine

An abnormally high depths of marked atom penetration at shock loading have been discovered for Fe and then were observed for a number of metals. In this work, this phenomenon is thoroughly investigated for the Mo-Re single crystals. It was found that Re moderates substantially the mass transfer. The derth of penetration of the Ni-63 isotopes decreases to 17 and 3 percents of that value for pure Mo if the Re content is 10 and 17 at.%, respectively. These results are discussed in a framework of Re impact on generation and migration of interstitials under movement of jugged screw dislocations. Moreover, the Re alloying increases the contribution of twinning to the plastic deformation. A computer model of enhanced mass transfer at shock loading has been proposed and the Re impact was numerically studied.

Structure of Re single crystal with the {0001}&lt;1120&gt; orientation subjected to rolling has been investigated. Initial orientation is unstable and single crystal is transformed to polycrystalline state. This texture evolution has been analyzed by a computer model. A good agreement with experiment has been achieved. Strain dependence of density of the Re crystal reveals abrupt increase at about 22% of strain, although visible cracks at external surface appear only at ~30% of strain. The last value corresponds to pronounced intensifying of the subsequent recrystallization under annealing. Influence of rotational deformation modes have been numerically studied and their substantial impact on axial textures of Re was predicted.

The yield stress and the ductile-brittle transition temperature of the W and W-Re single crystals of the specimens that were cut normally to the direction of crystals growing have been determined to be lower than in parallel cut ones. That is determined by dislocation structure anisotropy of single crystals. Alloying tungsten single crystal with rhenium results in considerable decrease of cold brittleness temperature Tb was shown. The most effective are the lowest rhenium concentration. Thus, adding of o.1 at.% Re decreases Tb from -40&#176;C and 4.3 at.% Re only to -60&#176;C in parallely cut specimens, for example. It should be marked, yield stress grows proportionally the rhenium content in alloys.

Electro-beam zone melting was used to grow high purity Re single crystals with different crystallography orientations. Thermo-electrical moving force (t-c.m.f.) of Re-single crystal was found to insignificantly increase upon 4 h vacuum annealing at 2000&#176;C. In this case anisotrophy of Re-single crystal t-e. m.f. substantially increased. Comparison between Re-single and polycrystals showed that electrical properties of single crystal were stable in contrary of that of the polycrystal. Structure, hardness and specific electrical resistivity of Re-single crystal were established to insubstantially increase upon thermocycling (1600-400&#176;C, 300 cycles). Specimens as 5x5 mm2, 100 mm rectangle (with two sides parallel to basic plane) were cut from Re-single crystal ingot. The shape of this specimens was unchanged upon above mentioned thermocycling.

In the eighties in the former USSR some efforts were made to create modern equipment for producing single crystals of refractory metals by electron beam (EB) floating zone melting. Using this EB furnaces, single crystals of tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, niobium and rhenium were produced. Dimen sions of crystals were up to 35-40 mm in diameter for tungsten and up to 110 mm for niobium. This report contains experimental data in studying process of growing single crystals of rhenium containing alloys based on molybdenum and tungsten, such as Mo48%Re alloys and W-27%Re and polycrystalline as cast rods and bars. It was found that this method is very efficient for producing calibrated bars from these alloys which can be used in wire production without mechanical treatment.

Plasma-arc welding was used to grow high purity W-Re single crystals in a wide concentration range (1-20 wt.% Re). Relationship between solidification (growth rate &quot;R&quot;, temperature gradient in liquid phase - ''GL', Re concentration - &quot;Co&quot;) and growth structure (cellular, dendritic, single- and polycrystalline) of W-Re alloys was determined and shown as &quot;Co - GL/R _&quot;' diagram. Effect of crystallographic instability was discovered for (W-Re) single crystals with [110] and [111] orientation which were changed to preferable [100] growth orientation upon growing. The reason of this orientation and its dynamics were examined. W-Re single crystals of 1st melt were characterized by considerable misorientation of 1st order subgrains from seed to the top of ingot and &quot;striped&quot; microstructure. Such structure and instability of crystallographic growth were examined by concentration undercoolings. The ways for improving of W-Re single crystals structure perfection are suggested.

Simulation of sulfide dissolution in cupric chloride media using the partial equilibrium approach has been investigated under different process conditions. The following observations may have a significant bearing on the dissolution behavior: The amount of cupric-chloro-hydroxy complexes is low, &lt;1% of total Cu(II), when the pH of the lixiviant is around 1.5 but increases at lower H+ concentrations. Under aerated conditions the hydrolysis is higher and control of pH during the dissolution process is necessary, the total initial Cu(II) concentration higher than 0.50 M does little to enhance dissolution but may entail a higher loss of &quot;free&quot; copper, the optimum temperature for cupric chloride leaching is around 373-378K (100-105&#176;C) and the presence of small amounts of ferric ion results in increasing the initial rate of dissolution as well as suppressing the hydrolysis of copper. <P>*Acknowledgments: This investigation forms a part of the INDO-US collaborative research programme supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the NSF, USA under NSF Grant No. INT-9103106.

This work outlines the results of leaching studies on a copper concentrate containing chalcocite (CU2S) and digenite (Cu9S5) with an acid saline solution of cupric chloride oxygenated at ambient pressure. The variables studied included the stirring speed, concentration of cupric ions, concentration of HCl, concentration of chloride ions, oxygen flow rate, temperature and time. The leaching system was found to be very effective for the dissolution of the concentrate. Over 95% of the copper was dissolved in 30 minutes with negligible dissolution of iron. The dissolution of copper increased with the stirring speed up to about 400 rpm and depended little on the total chloride concentration. The oxygen flowrate affected the dissolution of copper only below 0.09 l/min. The concentration of HCl did not influence tile dissolution providing its was sufficient to avoid the precipitation of copper oxychloride. The study of the effect of the temperature showed a maximum in copper dissolution around 90&#176;C.

Pyrite oxidation in chloride solution was investigated with cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance and potential step techniques. The pyrite oxidation in quiescent electrolytes is irreversible and controlled by diffusion. Depression of the semi-circle in the complex plane plot has been explained mathematically based on the concept of the equivalent circuit. When the semicircle is depressed, the mathematical formula indicates that the reaction resistance should be obtained from the intersection of the semi-circle with Z'-axis instead of the semi-circle diameter. The peak charging current densities at 1.10 and 0.90 V vs. SHE obtained from the equivalent circuit coupled with the ac impedance measurements match the peak current densities obtained with the potential step measurements.

<P>
The leaching behavior of chalcopyrite concentrate in acidic CUCl2-NaCl-O2 solutions was investigated. Experiments were conducted under continuous flow of oxygen at atmospheric pressures. The results indicated that among the variables temperature has the largest influence on the dissolution of chalcopyrite in this medium, and high dissolution can only be obtained at temperatures near the boiling point of the solution. It was also found that the stirring speed did not influence appreciably the dissolution of chalcopyrite and that an increase in the oxygen flow rate in the leaching reactor increased the dissolution of chalcopyrite. The total chloride concentration affects markedly the dissolution of chalcopyrite up to about 4 M. Copper dissolutions of about 85% were obtained in leaching chalcopyrite of size fraction -65+100# Tyler at 100&#176;C in 2 hours.

COMPLEXES OF NIOBIUM (IV,V) IN LiF-NaF-KF MELTS WITH VARYING O2- CONCENTRATIONS:</B> Flemming Matthiesen and Pia Tolstrup, Jensen Kernisk Lab. A, DTU, 2800, Lyngby, Denmark; Terje Ostvold, Institutt for Uorganisk Kjemi, NTNU, Gloshaugen, 7034, Trondheim

The ternary eutectic LiF-NaF-KF (FLINAK) melt at 700&#176;C was used as a solvent for a study of Nb(IV,V)-O-F complexing. The motivation for this study is the electroplating mechanism of Nb from such melts. A 1.8 mol% Nb2O5 solubility is observed in this melt. The dissolution mechanism is K+ +Nb2O5=NbO2Fx1-x+KNbO3(s)+xF-. When Na2O or SrO is added to FLINAK containing 1 mol% Nb(V), a constant concentration of Nb and a concentration of O2- given by the added oxide up to nO/nNb=2 is observed. For 2 &lt; nO/nNb &lt; 3, the NbO2Fx1-x complex reacts to form KNbO3(s). The solubility data of this compound is matched by literature data. By further additions of O2-, this solid reacts to form NbO43- type complexes. When Na2O is added to FLINAK containing 1 mol% Nb(IV), a constant concentration of Nb and a concentration of O2- given by the added oxide up to nO/nNb=1 is observed. Above this ratio some Na2O still dissolves, but an unknown compound precipitates. At nO/nNb=2 the O2- and Nb(IV) concentrations decrease with increasing oxide additions and reaches a minimum at NO/nNb=3 and probably K2NbO3(s) is formed. Up to nO/nNb=3 the melts are coloured, but changes to colourless (white solids when cooled) at nO/nNb&gt;3. A melt containing a complex of the type NbO42- is probably formed at these high oxide concentrations. Na2O is now completely soluble in the melt.

Stainless steel-zirconium waste form alloys are being developed at Argonne National Laboratory for the immobilization of metallic materials left behind following the electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel. The metal waste form comprises fuel cladding, noble metal fission products (e.g., Ru, Rh, Pd, Zr, and Tc), and other metallic constituents. These metallic wastes are not generated in the electrorefiner; they are present with the spent fuel before treatment. The nominal compositions stainless steel- 15 wt% zirconium and zirconium-8 wt% stainless steel are the baseline alloys for stainless steel-clad and Zircaloy-clad fuels, respectively. The selection process for the baseline compositions will be described and the subsequent development of basic alloying procedures will be reviewed (e.g., alloying temperatures, molten metal containment, and heating method).

MODELLING OF CREEP CRACK GROWTH:</B> <I>George R. Webster</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, London, SW7 2BX, UK
<P>
Failure in high temperature components which suffer creep can occur by net section rupture, crack growth or some combination of both processes depending on the loading conditions. Failure by crack growth is most likely to occur from sites of stress concentration or in components which contain an initial defect. In many practical situations, cracking is preceded by an incubation period, or at least a transient region of very slow growth, prior to the onset of steady state behaviour. This transient region can occupy the majority of life and it is important that it is taken into account to obtain reliable lifetime predictions. In this presentation non linear fracture mechanics concepts will be used to predict the behaviour. A model involving the build up of damage in a process zone at a crack tip will be employed to describe an incubation period, the transient region and steady state crack propagation rates. The role of superimposed fatigue loading will be examined. The analysis will be applied to characterize high temperature crack growth in polycrystalline, directionally solidified and single crystal materials.

INTERFACIAL DECOHESION FROM SURFACE - ABSORBED EMBRITTLING ELEMENTS:</B> R.C. Muthiah1, Y. Xu2, <I>C.J. McMahon1</I> and J.L. Bassani2, 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering; 2Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA
<P>
Motivated by problems in high-temperature cracking in superalloys exposed to an oxidizing environment, McClintock and Bassani (1981) developed a model that considered the diffusion along a grain boundary due to a concentration gradient alone and the resulting decohesion in the presence of the time-dependent crack-tip stresses. More recently, Bika and McMahon (1995) extended their ideas to include the influence of the crack-tip stress gradient on the diffusion process. In this paper we develop a model where diffusion is driven both by concentration and stress gradients while those stresses are directly influenced by cracking process. The formulation utilizes a cohesive zone model that couples creep deformation, diffusion, and damage ahead of a crack to predict the cracking due to dynamic embrittlement. This cracking process is being studied experimentally in systems in which the surface-active embrittling element comes either from the material itself, i.e., from surface segregation, or from the surrounding atmosphere. Both polycrystalline and bicrystal specimens are being employed. We have found that a precipitation-hardened copper-beryllium alloy makes an ideal model material for the study of stress-driven oxygen-induced embrittlement in high-strength alloys. The effect of varying the diffusion coefficient as function of direction in bicrystals is being investigated in a copper-tin alloy, in which the embrittlement comes from surface-segregated tin.

STRESS INDUCED ELECTRICAL FIELDS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTURE IN CERAMICS:</B> <I>Rishi Raj</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853
<P>
High temperature fracture in ceramics is nearly always controlled by the nucleation and growth of intergranular cavities. The mechanism of growth is stress induced diffusion of point defects. In ceramics the point defects are charged and therefore, their movement can be influenced by local electrical fields. Internal fields can arise near interfaces as a result of net segregation of charged defects to the interfaces. These electrical fields can, in turn, change the defect concentration, thereby, the self diffusivity in the nanoscale region adjacent to the interface. I will discuss, and present results from fundamental experiments that show how these fields can be influenced by applied stress and how these fields participate in the fracture kinetics. Further consideration leads us to speculate on the use of externally applied electrical fields to control nucleation and growth of cavities at grain boundaries.

<P>
A new accommodation process for high-strain rate superplastic flow is analyzed from a viewpoint of the relaxation of stress concentrations at triple junctions of grain boundaries for the alloys and around reinforcement particles for the composites resulting from sliding at boundaries and interfaces. A special process by an accommodation helper such as a liquid phase is required to continue superplastic flow when the stress concentration is insufficiently relaxed by diffusional flow and/or diffusion-controlled dislocation movement under the given deformation conditions. A liquid plays an important role as an accommodation helper in the accommodation mechanisms of high strain-rate superplasticity, that is, in an assistance to relax stress concentrations caused by sliding. However, the presence of a liquid phase does not always lead to the high strain-rate superplasticity. The critical conditions such as optimum distribution, thickness and volume in liquid phase are discussed based on the observation results by transmission electron microscopy and cavitation behavior. Cavitation behavior at various conditions for liquid phases are investigated by a quantitative analysis for high strain rate superplastic materials. It is suggested from theoretical analysis that diffusion-controlled cavity growth is limited and the plastically-controlled cavity growth is dominant when stress concentrations at triple junctions of boundaries and around reinforcements are relaxed by the presence of a liquid phase, so that the cavity growth is significantly slow in a small cavity size range. This view was in agreement with the experimental data of the cavity growth rates.

ROLE OF DIFFUSIONAL RELAXATION IN FRACTURE OF ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITES DURING CREEP AND SUPERPLASTICITY: </B><I>Rajiv S. Mishra</I> and Amiya K. Mukherjee, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis, CA 95616
<P>
Reinforcement of metallic matrix with second phase ceramic particles can lead to significant increase in creep strength. Some of these composites also exhibit high strain rate superplasticity. The diffusional relaxation of stresses during creep and superplastic deformation plays an important role. For example, the creep fracture behavior depends on the diffusional relaxation rate. Diffusional relaxation models can be used to calculate the critical creep rate. Below the critical creep rate intergranular fracture is observed, whereas above the critical creep rate transgranular fracture is observed. These observations can be explained on the basis of metal/ceramic interface decohesion. The importance of early onset of interfacial cavitation in the analysis of creep data to obtain mechanistic interpretation is discussed. The change in high strain rate superplasticity mechanism with the size of reinforcement is also explained using the diffusional relaxation models.

CREEP FRACTURE DURING SOLUTE-DRAG CREEP AND SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION: </B><I>Eric M. Taleff*</I>, Donald R. Lesuer** and Chol K.

<P>
Creep fracture has been studied in Al-Mg and Al-Mg-Mn alloys undergoing solute-drag creep and in micro-duplex stainless steel undergoing superplastic deformation. Failure in these materials can be controlled by two mechanisms, neck formation and cavitation. The mechanism of creep fracture during solute-drag creep in Al-Mg is found to change from necking-controlled fracture to cavitation-controlled fracture as Mn content is increased. Binary Al-Mg material fails by neck formation during solute-drag creep, and cavities are formed primarily in the neck region due to high hydrostatic stresses. Ternary alloys of Al-Mg-Mn containing 0.25 and 0.50 wt pct Mn exhibit more uniform cavitation, with the 0.5Mn alloy clearly failing by cavity interlinkage. Failure in the micro-duplex stainless steel is controlled by cavity growth and interlinkage during superplastic deformation. Cavitation was measured at several strains, and cavitation is found to increase as an exponential function of strain. An important aspect of cavity growth in the superplastic stainless steel is the long latency time before cavitation occurs. For a short latency period, cavitation acts to significantly reduce ductility below that by neck growth alone. This effect is most pronounced in materials with high strain-rate sensitivity, for which neck growth occurs very slowly.

FAILURE BEHAVIOR OF DUCTILE LAYERS IN LAMINATED COMPOSITES:</B> <I>S. Bulent Biner</I>, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, 208 Metals Development Building, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
In this study, the failure of the ductile layers from collinear, multiple and delaminated cracks that occur in laminated composite systems was studied using a constitutive relationship that accounts for strength degradation resulting from the nucleation and growth of voids. The results indicate that in laminated composites, void nucleation and growth ahead of cracks occur at a much faster growth rate due to evolution of much higher stress values at the interface region. Except for short crack extensions, collinear and multiple cracks develop crack resistance curves similar to that seen for a crack in the ductile layer material as in homogenous isotropic cases. For delaminated crack cases, the fracture behavior is strongly influenced by the delaminating length. The resistance of the ductile layers to crack extension can be significantly reduced by short delamination lengths; however, for large delamination lengths the resistance to crack extension becomes greater than that seen for the ductile material.

Results from finite element analyses have long been used to model high temperature crack growth processes beginning with the pioneering work of Bassani and McClintock. Recently, finite element results have been used to to study the mechanisms of high temperature crack growth under mixed-mode loading. Experimental studies of this failure process in high temperature alloys and intermetallics have been performed by measuring crack growth direction and crack growth rate in specially designed specimens under Mode I, Mode II and a range of mixed-mode loading conditions. The focus has been on how certain multiaxial stress parameters determined from finite element results can be used to predict both the crack paths and crack growth rates observed experimentally. This approach has led to a better understanding of the dominant crack growth processes in the high temperature materials investigated.

ON VOID GROWTH IN VISCOPLASTIC SOLIDS UNDER CREEP-FATIGUE CONDITIONS:</B> <I>Raj Mohan</I> and F.W. Brust, Engineering Mechanics Department, Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, OH 43201 USA
<P>
The growth of intergranular voids in elastic-viscoplastic solids is studied using an axisymmetric micromechanical model. Numerical unit cell calculations are performed under remote slow as well as fast cyclic loading. Among the many issues examined include the effect of initial void shape, the effect of on boundary diffusion, the effect of primary creep mechanism, the effect of stress triaxiality as well as the role of elastic accommodation. The results of the study demonstrate that the void growth history and void shape evolution are significantly affected by stress triaxiality, material nonlinearity and initial void shape. The importance of accounting for primary creep mechanism, in addition to secondary creep (power-law creep) is demonstrated for cyclic loading conditions. The analyses shed some light on experimentally observed peculiar behavior under balanced cyclic loading.

TWO PARAMETER CHARACTERIZATION OF CRACK TIP FIELDS UNDER THERMOMECHANICAL LOADING:</B> <I>Noel P. O'Dowd</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, London, SW7 2BX, United Kingdom
<P>
Two parameter approaches (K-T, J-Q) have been used to account for constraint and geometry in fracture under mechanical testing. This paper examines the effect of thermal loading on the near tip constraint. Finite element analyses of representative thermal loading which give rise to high and low constraint fields (high and low T and Q) have been conducted. As in previous analyses linear elastic, power law hardening materials have been examined. Following the thermal loading the structure is subjected to mechanical loading, both tension and bending dominated to assess the effect on the near tip constraint. On subsequent mechanical loading it is observed that the two parameter structure of the fields is maintained and the values of Q stress have been obtained from the analyses. The thermal loading initially has a strong effect on the <I>Q</I> value but at higher loads when the mechanical loading dominates, this effect is much weaker. The ability of a combined thermo-mechanical <I>T</I> stress approach to characterize the variation in constraint is assessed.

HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTURE OF 6061/Al2O3 MMC'S DEFORMED AT HIGH STRAIN RATES:</B> P. Ganguly and <I>Warren J. Poole</I>, Department of Metals and Materials Engineering, The University of British Columbia,, 309-6350 Stores Road, Vancouver, B.C., V6T 1Z4 Canada
<P>
The deformation of the particulate reinforced metal-matric composites (PRMMC) at high temperatures and high strain rates is of critical importance for a number of industrial forming applications, such as hot rolling and hot extrusion. The ductile fracture mechanism in this regime is the classic void nucleation, growth and coalescence, with the void nucleation arising from particle fracture or decohesion of the matrix-particle interface. To predict the onset of damage, it is important to be able to estimate the stress and strain states in and around the reinforcing particles. However, the situation is complicated by relaxation processes in the matrix, which tend to lower the stresses in the particles and at the matrix-particle interface. Furthermore, at large volume fractions (&gt;0.25), the interaction between adjacent particles becomes significant resulting in substantially larger hydrostatic stresses which can aid or deter the formation of the voids depending on whether the hydrostatic stresses are compressive or tensile. The present work aims at studying the failure of PRMMC at high temperature (200&#176;C to 550&#176;C) and moderately high strain rates (0.1 to 10 s-1). Collar compression testing will be used to evaluate the ductility of these materials. The deformation of the macroscopic sample (i.e. w/o the explicit presence of the particles, but with the mechanical properties of the composite) has been modelled using the FEM code ABAQUS. The deformation at the particle length scale has been then determined by imposing the boundary conditions from the macroscopic model on a unit-cell FEM model with single or multiple particles. Metallographic examination of the fracture sites has also been conducted to aid the interpretation of the fracture mechanism.

The mechanism of ductile fracture of metallic and some ceramic materials subjected to uniaxial and bending loading in a wide temperature range as well as fracture toughness, and its temperature and structural dependencies are discussed. The main instrument that was used to formulate the ductile fracture mechanism was scanning and transmission electron microscopy of single and polycrystalline, and strengthened by particles, materials. On the basis of study of fracture surfaces of pre-deformed pure particleless materials, the mechanisms of void nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids was found. <I>The pore in particleless materials nucleate along the boundaries of dislocation cellular structure that formed in a course of deformation preceding fracture</I>. The nucleation of pores and subsequent delaminations along the cell and grain boundaries is the main reason of the fracture toughness increase of pre-deformed materials. With the longitudinal cleavage technique it is shown that the intergranular pores nucleate first of all. The decrease of grain size promotes to the transition from cleavage to ductile, by void coalescence, fracture. In materials strengthened with particles there is the temperature region where particles, even with weak interface, do not play the preferable sites of pores nucleation. In those materials, two kinds of ductile, by void coalescence, fracture mechanism may be determined. It is shown that the same mechanism of pores nucleation is valid in ionic (NaCl) single crystals but at temperature above 0.6 of melting temperature. In partially stabilized zirconia single crystals some dislocation plasticity arises at temperature above 1300&#176;C and results in delaminations along interdomain boundaries that points out the same mechanism of pores nucleation. In silicon nitride ceramics the dimple-like, the so-called foam-like, fracture may be found as a result of decomposition of silicon nitride into silicon oxide and gases at temperature above 1000&#176;C. To estimate the fracture toughness of materials failed by ductile manner, the formula: where is the yield stress, is the elastic modulus and is the diameter of the dimples, is proposed. It is shown also that toughness of ductile fracture decreases with temperature and is proportional to the root square of the yield stress. All the conclusions are proven using fractographical data.

<P>
The Metal Spray Forming Technology Group of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWC-CD) has conducted research in support of Navy and private industry programs. In the spray forming process, a liquid stream of molten metal is atomized into a spray of semi-solid, semi-liquid particles and the metal spray is subsequently collected onto either a cylindrical or flat substrate that is rotating and translating underneath the spray. Spray forming produces a characteristic fine equiaxed, nearly-full dense microstructure in a near net shape product which can be subsequently processed. NSWC-CD has both non-reactive and reactive metal (titanium) R&amp;D spray forming facilities. The non-reactive facility has a 300 lb. Melt capacity and is used to produce nickel, steel, or copper alloy parts. Over 380 runs have been conducted on this R&amp;D plant since 1988. This facility is also used to produce prototype parts in support of the Navy Manufacturing Technology spray forming plant, which is currently operated by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. In 1995, NSWC-CD installed a Reactive (Titanium) Metal Spray Forming Facility. The facility utilizes cold wall &quot;skull&quot; induction melting to produce up to 75 pounds of molten titanium (7000) cm3, 424 in3) for spray deposition. Recent results from both plants will be presented.

A spray cast aluminum-lithium alloy with nominal composition Al-3Li-1Cu-0.6Mg-0.3Zr (wt.%) has been successfully processed into 0.090 in. thick sheet. Following solutionizing at 540&#176; C, selected combinations of quenching, stretching and aging treatments were evaluated in terms of their effect on the tensile properties of the final sheet product. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructural changes introduced by variations in aging practice. Although the maximum attainable yield strength was observed to increase with decreasing aging temperature, the double aging treatment of 3 hours at 170&#176;C followed by 26 hours at 190&#176;C, originally investigated by Gregson and Flower for similar direct chil cast Al-Li alloys, was shown to be effective in minimizing the in plane anisotropy frequently observed in Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr sheet products.

Non-heat treatable aluminum alloys rely on a combination of solid solution hardening and plastic deformation to achieve usable strength. The Al-Mn and Al-Mn-Mg alloys (3000 series) are used in applications requiring a high degree of deep drawing capability. Improved formability an drawability require high degree of ductility which depends upon rolling texture, recrystallization texture, grain size uniformity, and grain morphology. Spray metal forming produces a very fine and controlled starting microstructure which can have a profound effect on subsequent mechanical working and heat treatments. DC cast and spray metal formed Al-Mn and Al-Mn-Mg alloys were deformed to various amounts after which, microstructure and crystallographic texture were determined via x-ray diffraction pole figures. Subsequent recrystallization treatments were applied to evaluate the effect of the spray formed microstructure on recrystallization texture, recystallization kinetics, grain size, grain uniformity and mechanical anisotropy.

Aluminum-silicon alloys, especially hypereutectic silicon compositions are finding increasing use in automotive components that are subjected to sliding contact. Conventional DC casting methods for processing these alloys result in unsuitably large primary silicon particles for subsequent extrusion and forging. Three spray cast hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloys were processed to various states of extrusion, heat treatment and over aging. Wear measurements have been performed using the pin-on-ring configuration in the unlubricated condition sliding velocities of 4.46 m/s. The ring mating surfaces were grey iron. As cast B390 aluminum alloy was also wear tested for a standard of comparison. The worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy, electron beam microprobe analysis, and cross section microscopy to determine the nature and mechanism of wear.

<P>
The current development of technology is followed by the more and more complex demands for construction materials. In many cases the use of a combined material that has both the necessary hardness of the base and the high resistance of the outside layer to the environmental factors and wear is most efficient. This can be achieved by applying different kinds of protective coatings. Electro-spark alloying is one of perspective methods of coating deposition. This paper discusses the process of depositing the tungsten boride base composite powder material using a powerful impulse discharge, developed in a semi-closed volume with an electric field, accomplished by interaction of the powder units with the discharge plasma fed into the electrode space in gaseous environment. The process is conducted on a &quot;Rasryad-3A&quot; set, designed for coating with powder electrode materials.

In this study an Al-17Si-4.5Cu-0.6Mg was synthesized utilizing the spray atomization and co-deposition technique to modify the distribution of the silicon phase in the alloy matrix. Detailed microstructural characterization studies were done using optical and electron microscopy observations with an emphasis on understanding the influence of spray deposition processing on distribution of the silicon phases in the alloy deposition processing on distribution of the silicon phases in the alloy matrix. Specimens of the aluminum alloy were cyclically deformed under stress-amplitude control over a range of amplitudes. The mechanisms and micro-mechanisms governing cyclic stress response and fatigue life of the alloy will be highlighted, compared with a conventional ingot metallurgy processed counterpart, and discussed. The kinetics governing the cyclic deformation characteristics and fracture processes of the spray processed and conventional ingot metallurgy processed alloys will rationalize in light of mutually interactive influences of microstructural effects, nature of loading, matrix deformation characteristics, macroscopic aspects of fracture, and ductility of the material. *Research supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Langley, Virginia) (Grant Number: NAGI-1619), with material support from Reynolds Company (Richmond, VA).

Very recently the major break-through in spray forming of high performance aluminium has been achieved. After many years of intensive alloy and process development, the first long time volume application could be realised. The use of PM aluminium for cylinder liners in gasoline passenger car engines gives strong improvements in the system of piston, piston rings and liner running surface. Furthermore the engine emissions have been reduced drastically. Based on the progress made with respect to technical and economical aspects this first volume production will have great impact on other application in automotive and aircraft industries or for leisure equipment. The paper describes the state of the art spray forming of aluminium based alloys under technical and metallurgical aspects. Examples will be given several applications in different market sections with functionally relevant test results.

Spray-casting process is becoming increasingly attractive as an alternate production route for particulate reinforced metal matrix composites, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites can be controlled by altering the level of reinforcement. In this study, performs of Al-Si matrix composites reinforced with SiCp were fabricated by spray-casting process, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites were investigated using thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) after hot-extruded. It was found that the CTE of the composite with SiCp reduced with increase in volume fraction of SiC particles, and the Al-Si performs without SiCp also exhibited reduced CTE compared to mold-cast specimen. The effect of the grain and Si phase size, and the aspect ratio of Si phase, as well as the volume fraction of the SiCp on the CTE of the Al-Si composite have also been examined.

Microstructural transitions from segregation free zones to cellular/dendrite regions increased with increasing wheel velocity and the superheat of molten metal before ejection. X-ray diffraction spectra indicated an increasing tendency towards a (200) preferred orientation on the wheel-side surface of the ribbon with increasing the superheat of molten metal. A model based on a two-dimensional cellular automaton technique coupled with the control volume method was developed for the prediction of dendrite grain structures in planar flow casting.

The technical problems and cost associated with the multi-step PM processing of RS Al alloys have hindered their successful development. Spray forming can obviate these problems by means of the integral inert gas atomisation and deposition operation in which the alloy exists in particulate form only for a few milliseconds. Spray forming experiments have been performed on Al-Cr-Zr alloys studied previously by the combined RS/PM route.

Damping capacity of a material refers its ability to dissipate vibrational energy into thermal energy. In Al-Zn system, damping originates form the interfacial friction between two phases and the damping capacity is proportional to the interfacial area. The microstructure of spray cast alloys are very different from the cast alloys and the damping characteristics of spray cast Al-Zn alloys is expected to be also different. In this study, the effect of third element on the damping behaviour of spray cast Al-Zn alloys was studied. Al-Zn-X alloys were made by spray cast and mold cast. Third elements were Cu, Mg and Mn. Uniformly rolled cast and sprayed specimens were solution treated then quenched by water. Specimens were aged at room temperature for 24 hours. Damping capacity was measured by logarithmic decrement of freely decayed vibration of cantilever beam. Damping capacity of spray cast alloys was higher than cast alloys. Dilute tried elements increased the hardness but decreased the damping capacity alightly.

Previous studies have demonstrated the technique of producing continuous cast, directionally solidified castings of a limited number of alloys. These procedures have been successful when the casting conditions are established so that the solid-liquid interface is maintained outside of the mold by insuring a mold temperature in excess of the liquidus temperature and a solid-liquid interface located near enough to the mold so that the molten metal surface tension is able to support the liquid phase. Rods varying from 3 to 10 mm. (0.12 to 0.39 in.) D. have been successfully cast in this manner. This study has expanded that technique to a 1% Si aluminum alloy, and the casting, and the casting conditions which would enable production of an 8 mm. (0.31 in).

The improper control of the amount of As, Sb and Bi in the anode that enter de tankhouse, attributable either to a bad schedule of concentrate input or to the unavailability of clean concentrates from the international market, as well as the lack of means to maintain the suitable level of these elements in the electrolyte together with other operational circumstances, can result in off-grade copper, as well as affect the starting sheet quality chemically and physically. This paper presents in a practical way the relationship between the operational conditions and the cathode and starting sheet quality produced at CMSA, covering the period of the last five years of operation, discusses the technologies available in the market for antimony and bismuth removal and compares the results of testwork, achieved in the laboratories of CMSA, using two resins not associated with patented technologies.

REMOVAL OF ANTIMONY AND BISMUTH FROM COPPER ELECTROLYTE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL PLANT AT AMARILLO COPPER REFINERY:</B> <I>R.M. Cunningham</I>, Asarco Inc, Amarillo, TX; J.V. Calara &amp; M.K. King, Asarco Technical Services Center, Salt Lake City, UT
<P>
Asarco operates one of the largest individual copper electrorefineries in the world at Amarillo, Texas. The feed is a mixture of anodes from Asarco smelters and copper purchased from various primary and secondary sources. The variation in feed makes it imperative that the refinery practices state-of-the-art quality control to minimize the effects of unwanted impurities. In late 1993, a plant designed to significantly reduce the antimony and bismuth levels in the electrolyte was commissioned. The purification plant uses ion exchange technology in conjunction with a novel stripping system developed by Zeneca Specialties, which permits the recycling of the eluant. Thereby, the extremely high costs of stripping with conventional reagents are avoided. In addition, the environmental impact of treating the eluant for recovery of antimony and bismuth is minimized. This paper outlines the development of the technology and, in particular, describes the operational practices and improvements at Amarillo since the commissioning of the plant.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE NICKEL SULFATE HEXAHYDRATE PRODUCED AT CARAIBA BY APPLYING THE QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT METHOD (Q.F.D.):</B> <I>Ivan Marcelo Santos Moraes</I> and Group of Q.F.D., Caraiba Metais S.A., Via do Cobre N&#176; 3700, A.l.O. - Copec, Dias D'Avila - Bahia Brazil, CEP 42800-000
<P>
Caraiba Metais has a plant for the purification and the crystallization of the crude nickel sulfate removed from its copper electrolyte purification system. In November 1994, an interdepartmental group was formed to study the Q.F.D method, through its application on the improvement of the quality of the nickel sulfate hexahydrate. The team, formed with representatives of the following areas: production, technology, marketing, sales, maintenance, laboratory and TQC office, had also the task of checking the applicability of the method to other products of the company. This paper describes the main steps such as the survey of customer's demands, the preparation of the quality matrix, the planned and the designed quality and the consequent identification of the engineering bottlenecks. It is also shown how these bottlenecks were studied and solved. The application of the method allowed the team to identify means of increasing the production capacity by 40%, to improve the intrinsic quality of the product (including packaging), and to increase the reliability of the process.

COPPER SULFATE RECOVERY USING FLUIDIZED BED CRYSTALLIZATION:</B> Martin Schranz, <I>Robert J. Farrell</I>, Swenson Process Equipment Inc., 15700 Lathrop Ave., Harvey, IL 60426
<P>
Copper sulfate pentahydrate is recovered from the spent etchant waste stream of a printed circuit/wiring board manufacturing facility. The fluidized bed crystallizer contains submerged cooling surfaces (through which a coolant is passed) which are bathed in a stream of air. The air bubbles provide agitation which improve heat transfer, reduce fouling and maintain crystals in suspension. The recently patented fluidized bed crystallization apparatus (US 5,523,064) has significant advantages when compared to a conventional surface cooled crystallizer including capital cost, ease of operation and production of larger more uniform crystals.

THE DARPA PROGRAM IN ADVANCED THIN FILM COATING TECHNOLOGY:</B> <I>Lawrence H. Dubois</I>, Thomas J. Moran, Defense Sciences Office, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington, VA
<P>
Corrosion and wear of mechanical and structural components and systems cost U.S. Industry and the military millions of dollars every year and leads to excess waste, decreased product reliability, and poor worker safety. Unfortunately, the surface preparation, application and use of most coatings to protect to protect these components leads to the generation of significant quantities of hazardous wastes which are subsequently released to the air, water and land. Through the development of new, more advanced corrosion and wear resistant coating systems and/or surface preparation techniques, the DoD and its suppliers can not only minimize the environmental impact of these materials, but improve performance and decrease costs. The DARPA program in advanced thin film coatings is developing innovative technologies to eliminate volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and other hazardous waste materials in the manufacture, application and maintenance of high performance wear, fatigue and corrosion resistant coatings of utility to the DoD.

ADVANCES IN SURFACE TECHNOLOGY IN RUSSIA:</B> <I>Anthony J. Perry</I>, ISM Technologies, San Diego, CA; Jesse N. Matossian, Hughes Research Labs, Malibu, CA; Michael O. Thompson, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY
<P>
Since the removal of the Berlin Wall and the changes in the relationships between the former Soviet Union with the rest of the world, a great deal of information has become available on their technology. Developments in some areas appear to have outpaced those in the West, specifically in the application of ion beams to surface modification. The present authors have had the opportunity to attend workshops in Russia and to visit laboratories. In the present work, a report is given on some of the technologies reviewed there and which are now becoming available to the West. These include novel designs in the fields of cathodic arc sources and gas ion sources, and intense ion and electron beams. These technologies will be presented.

THE JET DEPOSITION PROCESS: NEW TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Brett Halpern</I>, Jet Process Corporation, 24 Science Park, New Haven, CT 06511
<P>
Development of the &quot;sonic jet sources in low vacuum&quot; theme enables the Jet Vapor Deposition<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> process (JVD<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>) to make a wide range of thin film materials. Thus, we have developed jet sources, driven in the 0.1-10 torr range by mechanical pumps, for deposition of metals, semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, alloys and guest-host materials in multicomponent and multilayer form. These sources combine high rate, high efficiency, and low temperature operation with excellent control of microstructure. For example, we recently described and patented an &quot;electron-jet, or e-jet<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> &quot;source, which combines metal thermal vaporization with an intense thermionic plasma and allows high rate deposition of metals, oxides and nitrides coupled with simultaneous ion bombardment at high flux and low energy. JVD's versatility opens new approaches to problems in electronic, automotive, aerospace, corrosion resistance and optical applications. In this talk we review the principles of JVD, new jet source developments, JVD's advantages over conventional CVD and PVD and recent commercial applications.

DoD ACTIVITIES IN ION BEAM PROCESSING: </B> <I>James K. Hirvonen</I>, Metals Research Branch, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, AMSRL-WM-ME, APG, MD 21005-5069
<P>
The use of energetic ion beams for beneficially modifying the surface sensitive properties of critical military material has been pursued within DoD now for almost two decades demonstrating improved material properties including increased wear-, fatigue-, corrosion-, and oxidation-resistance. High dose ion implantation has been demonstrated to be technically suitable for extending the lifetime of precision aerospace bearings (U.S. Navy) and specific cutting tools (U.S. Army). Ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) processing has increased both the number and the variety of DoD applications, including robust optical coatings and coatings for wear, corrosion and fatigue improvements. A DoD program exploring these benign, dry, ion beam techniques for supplanting the wet Cr/Cd electroplating processing is currently underway at the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence in Johnstown, PA. This program includes the scheduled installation, (Fall 96) of a large ion beam system for the processing of selected DoD components. The status of this program and other recent DoD ion beam efforts will be discussed.

SURFACE PROCESSING BY GAS CLUSTER ION BEAMS:</B> <I>Allen Kirkpatrick</I>, Epion Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730
<P>
Clusters consisting of hundreds or thousands of weakly bound atoms can be formed from various gases by expanding the gas through a small nozzle into high vacuum. The clusters can be ionized and subjected to acceleration potentials so as to produce beams of cluster ions which possess high total energy, mass and momentum in combination with low energy per constituent atom. Cluster ion beams have been shown to be capable of producing processing effects which have not been available with monomer ions. A number of prospective applications for gas cluster ions have been identified and commercial gas cluster ion beam equipment is now being developed. This paper will review the current status of gas cluster ion technology and will include discussion of methods for generation of the gas cluster beams, kinetics of the interactions of cluster ions with solid materials, anticipated applications and available equipment.

COMPARISON OF DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ION ASSISTED COATINGS:</B> <I>A.J. Armini</I>, S.N. Bunker, L.A. Stelmack, Implant Sciences Corporation
<P>
The current ion assisted coating methods and the corresponding equipment are compared, for depositing a variety of wear and/or corrosion resistant coatings. Ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD), unbalanced magnetron sputtering, and cathodic arc processes were used to deposit coatings of amorphous diamond, chromium, and noble metals for various applications in the aerospace, biomedical, and industrial markets. The three techniques were compared with respect to coating uniformity, deposition rate, adhesion, and microstructure. Coatings were evaluated for hardness, adhesion, smoothness, sliding wear, and friction coefficient. Coating-substrate adhesion was measured using the diamond scratch test. Wear and friction were measured against several opposing materials, using a high speed, high temperature pin-on-disk instrument. Scale-up issues and the suitability of each technology for various production applications will be discussed.

OXIDE AND NITRIDE SUPERLATTICE COATINGS:</B> <I>William D. Sproul</I>, BIRL, Northwestern University, 1801 Maple Avenue, Evanston, IL 60201
<P>
Over the past 10 years, three major advances in reactive sputtering technology have made it possible to deposit both conductive and non-conductive fully-dense films at high rates. These three advances are unbalanced magnetron (UBM) sputtering, partial pressure control of the reactive gas, and pulsed DC power. Multicathode UBM sputtering systems provide a dense secondary plasma that produces well-adhered, fully dense films. With both pulsed-dc power and partial pressure control, films such as aluminum oxide can now be deposited reactively at rates up to 78% of the pure metal rate. The reactive UBM sputtering process is used to deposit polycrystalline nitride superlattice films such as TiN/NbN or TiN/VN with hardnesses exceeding 50 GPa, more than double the hardness of either component in the film. The nitride superlattice work is being extended to oxide films. Clear, amorphous, nano-layered Al2O3/ZrO2 films have been deposited at high rates with a hardness of 10 GPa. Work is underway to deposit these films in a crystalline form, which should enhance their hardness.

CONTROL OF INTERFACE STRENGTH IN NIOBIUM-ALUMINUM OXIDE MULTILAYERS BY ION BEAM ASSISTED DEPOSITION:</B> <I>G.S. Was</I>, H. Ji, J.W. Jones, Cooley Bldg., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; N. Moody, Sandia National Laboratory, Div. 8712, MS 9403, Livermore, CA 94551
<P>
The toughness of a niobium-aluminum oxide multilayer depends on the interface strength, which can be controlled by both the orientation relationship of the constituents and the composition at the interface. As a first approximation to multilayers, niobium films were deposited onto {0001} sapphire substrates by ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) under various conditions. In addition to the {110} fiber texture, strong in-plane texture was introduced by simultaneous ion bombardment. Stronger in-plane texture was developed with higher ion energy and ion to atom arrival rate ratio (R ratio). Different orientation relationships at the niobium-sapphire interface were achieved by varying the orientation of the sapphire substrates with respect to the ion beam incident direction. The hardness and modulus of the niobium layer were also modified by the ion bombardment. A dopant (Ag) was introduced at the interface at levels from a fraction of a monolayer to one monolayer during niobium layer deposition.

CONTROLLING THE EVOLUTION OF TEXTURE IN SPUTTER DEPOSITED Mo FILMS:</B> <I>S.M. Yalisov</I>, J.C. Bilello, University of Michigan, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ann Arbor MI 48119
<P>
Evolution of crystallographic ordering in sputter deposited polycrystalline refractory metal films has been observed in several laboratories. While the ordering in the growth direction, out-of-plane texture, is well known, the ordering in the plain of growth, in-plane texture, has only been reported by the ion enhanced growth community. The work presented here, will describe the conditions required for this behavior in the presence of energetic ions. Mo films were sputter deposited on amorphous substrates and grown to a large variety of thickness. The homologous temperature does not exceed 0.2 in any of the experiments performed. These films were characterized by a large battery of synchrotron x-ray, electron microscopy, and surface analysis. The data have led to an atomistic model to explain and predict the in-plane texturing based on shadowing and anisotropic growth rates which force a competitive grain growth mechanism during the growth. Detailed comparison to experiment will demonstrate the role that limited diffusion and mass transport play in the final microstructure of the film. Examples of how this model can be exploited to design a particular microstructure will be presented.

CERAMIC-METALLIC COATINGS BY ELECTRON BEAM PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION PROCESS:</B> Douglas Wolfe, M. Movchan, <I>Jogender Singh</I>, Applied Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16804
<P>
Electron beam physical-vapor deposition (EB-PVD) process is considered to be a cost-effective and robust coating technology that has overcome some of the difficulties or problems associated with the metals spray, CVD and PVD processes. The EB-PVD process offers many desirable characteristics such as relatively high deposition rates (up to 100-500 mm/minute with an evaporation rate ~10-15 Kg/hour), dense coatings, precise composition control, columnar and poly-crystalline microstructure, low contamination, and high thermal efficiency. Various metallic and ceramic coatings (oxides, carbides, nitrides) have been deposited at relatively low temperatures. EB-PVD has the capability of producing multilayered nanolaminated metallic/ceramic coatings on large components by changing the processing conditions such as ingot composition, part manipulation, and electron beam energy. Attachment of an ion beam source to the EB-PVD process offers additional benefits such as dense coatings with improved adhesion.

COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF PLASMA SOURCE ION IMPLANTATION:</B> <I> J.T. Scheuer</I>, K.C. Walter, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM; W.G. Horne, Empire Hard Chrome, Chicago, IL; R.A. Adler, North Star Research Corporation, Albuquerque, NM 87109
<P>
Commercial plasma source ion implantation (PSII) equipment built by North Star Research Corporation has recently been installed at Empire Hard Chrome, Chicago, IL. Los Alamos National Laboratory has assisted in this commercialization effort via two Cooperative Research and Development Agreements to develop the plasma source for the equipment and to identify low-risk commercial PSII applications. The PSII system consists of a 1m x 1m cylindrical vacuum chamber with a pulsed, inductively coupled rf plasma source. The pulse modulator is capable of delivering pulses with peak currents of 100 kV and peak currents of 300 A at maximum repetition rate of 400Hz. The pulse modulator uses a thyratron to switch a pulse forming network which is tailored to match the dynamic PSII load. This presentation will focus on early commercial applications to production tooling and manufactured components and characterization of implanted coupons.

SPUTTERED CHROME NITRIDE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ELECTROPLATED CHROME</B>: <I>Michael Graham</I>, Keith Legg, Paul Rudnik, Peter Chang, BIRL, Northwestern University, Evanston IL 60201
<P>
BIRL has been involved in hardcoating development for engineering applications for several years. A major effort over the past four years has focused on the replacement of electroplated chrome in applications where the steel substrates have moderate hardnesses (Rc38-42) and therefore only modest support for hard PVD coatings. Much of the development work has been supported by the government through DARPA as part of an environmental thrust to eliminate pollution sources and health hazards from their OEM's as well as their repair facilities. BIRL has developed the use of duplex processing (plasma nitriding + sputter-coating) and thick PVD coating (15-20um) with CrN and demonstrated wear performance characteristics superior to commercial chrome plating. This paper reviews some of the process developments involved in these programs and the wear test results. Production cost estimates have also been conducted for certain components, and it has been demonstrated that PVD coating is competitive with electroplating when the total manufacturing process is taken into account.

CHARACTERISTIC OF TiN FILM DEPOSITED ON STELLITE USING REACTIVE MAGNETRON SPUTTER ION PLATING:</B> <I>Whungwhoe Kim, </I>Joungsoo Kim, Surface Treatment Group, KAERI, Taejon, Korea, Mingu Lee, Heesoo Kang, Wonjong Lee, Dept. of Materials Science, KAIST Taejon, Korea
<P>
TiN films were deposited onto stellite 6B alloy (Co base) by the reactive magnetron sputter ion plating. As the substrate bias increases, TiN film changes from columnar structure to dense structure due to densification and resputtering by ion bombardment. Oxygen, the major impurity, is decreased greatly when the substrate bias is applied. The preferred orientation of the TiN films changes from (200) to (111) with decreasing N2/Ar ratio. The change of the preferred orientation is discussed in terms of surface energy and strain energy which are related with the impurity contents and the ion bombardment damage. The hardness of the TiN film increases with increasing compressive stress generated in the film by virtue of ion bombardment.

PULSED LASER DEPOSITION OF ELECTRONIC CERAMIC THIN FILMS:</B> <I>D.B. Chrisey</I>, J.S. Horwitz, P.C. Dorsey, L.A. Knauss, R.C.Y. Auyeung, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., 20375-5345
<P>
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a unique physical vapor deposition technique that is making available high quality thin films of complex, multicomponent materials for the design and fabrication of advanced electronic devices and protective coatings. Single phase and epitaxial thin films can be deposited in situ. by PLD. Recent applications of PLD include high temperature superconductors, ferroelectrics, magnetoresistive materials and ferrites. Ferroelectric thin films grown by PLD are currently being developed into low loss, frequency agile microwave electronics which exploit the electric field dependence of the dielectric constant. More recently, colossal magnetoresistance with DRH/RH=0 ~100,000% has been observed in thin films of rare earth manganites deposited by PLD. These materials have applications in magnetic field sensing and recording as well as electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells and room temperature microbolometers. This presentation will show recent examples applying PLD to high quality electronics ceramic thin films growth for next generation devices.

THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES--A PRATT AND WHITNEY PERSPECTIVE:</B> <I>S. Bose</I>, Pratt and Whitney, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108
<P>
The gas temperatures in the turbine section of Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines are hundreds of degrees higher than the melting point of the materials of construction. Exposure to such high temperatures would result in structural failure of the materials from a variety of mechanisms. Yet, in modern engines, the components, generally made a nickel and cobalt based superalloys, survive for extended periods of time. This is accomplished by devising efficient air cooling of the components and by applying Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) to the substrate alloy to reduce metal temperatures to safer levels. Combustor TBCs are processed with air plasma spray (APS) ceramic on APS metallic bond coat. Vanes, exposed to higher temperature and thermal load, require electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) ceramic on FE/A1 laminates of different layer thicknesses were produced by PVD. TEM studies showed that as deposited microstructure depends on the ratio of the nominal thicknesses of the FE and A1 layers and on the actual layer thickness. For dfe:da1=0.4mm the microstructure consisted of nanocrystals of Fe/A1 solid solution with A2 or B2 structure and A13Fe. For dfe:dA1&#187;44nm or 2.1mm:0.7mm laminated structures were produced. The laminates consisted of layers of Fe(A2-bcc) and of solid solution of Fe in A1 with B2 (ordered bcc) structure which was formed by interdiffusion between the Fe and A1 layers. Thermodynamic modelling showed that interdiffusion and interface reaction in the as deposited materials are closely related to the overall heat of mixing. The mechanical properties of the laminates will be related to their microstructures low pressure plasma spray (LPPS) bond coat. These TBCs have allowed the components to be operated at high gas path temperatures to meet thrust, efficient and life requirements of Pratt and Whitney's gas turbine engines. Details of Pratt and Whitney's experience on various aspects of TBCs will be discussed.

ANALYSIS OF THERMAL SPRAY METHOD FOR COATING NANOSCALE MATERIALS: </B> <I>Schmuel Eidelman, </I>Xiaolong Yang, Science Applications International Corporation, 1710 Goodridge Drive, McLean, VA
<P>
Thermal Spray (TS) system allows delivery of the plating materials to the substrates at high velocities (on the order of 1 to 1.5 km/sec) and high temperatures. The total pressure of the particle impinging on the surface can reach 10 Gpa for some of the TS systems. Lower sintering temperatures and higher ductility of nanoscale materials open a range of attractive and unique possibilities for high rate deposition of nanostructured coatings. We use a recently developed and validated three dimensional simulation capability to model the TS systems' gas and coating powder flow for the TS process analysis, to illustrate the roots of currently used TS systems' inefficiencies, and to optimize and control the coating process. Examples are given for the TS process designs with improved performance and system efficiency. The use of numerical simulation will be especially crucial for the plating with nanoscale powders.

ROLE OF INTERDIFFUSION AND HEAT TREATMENTS ON THE ADHESION OF PLASMA SPRAYED NiCrAlY COATINGS:</B> <I>C.S. Richard</I>, G.

Lu, Universite de Technologie de Troyes, Department de Genie des Systemes Mecaniques, 10000 Troyes, France
<P>
During service blades and vanes of stationary gas turbines are subject to different kinds of loadings like mechanical and thermal stresses as well as corrosion, oxidation and erosion. Against these phenomena, plasma spraying coatings are frequently used to protect the componenets in the hot parts of these engines. The layers are commonly deposited by Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and by Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS). One of the main parameters in quality of a coating is its adhesion on a Ni-based superalloy substrate. This study focused on a NiCrAlY metallic bonding layer and its adhesion on a Ni-based supralloy substrate. It looks at the influence of different spraying methods (APS and VPS) and the influence of a post heat treatment on the adhesion of the coatings. In order to determine the interface toughness, a Vickers interfacial indentation test, based on fracture mechanics method, was performed. In APS and VPS cases, the residual stresses were evaluated by a step-by-step drilling method and these were taken into account in the adhesion parameters. The results were supplemented by a microstructural study of the interface in order to understand the role of interdiffusion on adhesion.

PLASMA SPRAYED ZIRCONIA BASED COATINGS FOR USE AS AN INSULATING LAYER IN DIE CASTING:</B> <I>M. Giannis</I>, CAST, CSIRO Division Manufacturing Technology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
<P>
The casting of light alloys, such as aluminum, requires insulation in the form of a ceramic-based coating applied on the metallic die. This assists in the production of sound castings in gravity and low pressure die casting processes by preventing premature solidification. The currently used coatings are based on ceramic particles and sodium silicate binder slurry applied by spray-gun to the preheated substrate. These coatings were found to be fragile due to the highly porous network of binder an particles. Plasma spraying of ceramic zirconia-based particles was studied for possible use as a die coating. The coatings studied were characterized in terms of composition and microstructure. In addition, thermal properties were determined using experimental and simulation techniques to estimate the heat transfer coefficient at the die coating/casting interface. Zircona-based plasma sprayed coatings had high wear resistance and good heat transfer resistance and would therefore function as an improved die coating.

COATING PHASES OF COMMERCIAL GALVANNEALED COATINGS:</B> <I>Carlos Nelson Elias</I>, Universidade Federal Pluminense, Av.

<P>
Hot-dip galvannealed steel sheet has been increasingly used in the automotive industry and more recently it has been found that a zinc-iron alloy steel sheet, such as galvannealed would provide even better results. The galvannealed steel sheet is a product with good corrosion resistance, weldability and paintability. Therefore it has been used in the automotive and appliance industries. The properties of galvannealed steel are strongly influenced by the iron content of the coating, especially galling, corrosion resistance, welding and powdering. The galvannealed steel is predominately composed of delta phase. When the soft zeta phase is present in the surface of the coating, it adheres to the die and reduces the performance of steel sheet during deformation. When the hard and brittle gamma phase is at the interface steel-coating , the galvannealed coating fails by powdering. In this work we discuss the formation of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds in the industrial galvannealed coating.

RECENT TRENDS IN ELECTROPLATING:</B> <I>Brian Am Manty</I>, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, Johnstown, PA
<P>
This paper reports on recent trends and advances in electroplating as a surface finishing technology. It includes a description of environment and worker exposure regulations that have affected the industry. New developments in water and chemical recycling equipment and techniques have substantially reduced the amount of wastes generated during electroplating. Near-zero discharges are now technically and economically feasible for many electroplating shops. Several guidance documents are available to help electroplaters reduce wastes with simple, inexpensive techniques. Alternative electroplating processes and materials are also being developed for processes requiring the use of toxic materials. On-going programs within industry and the government are aimed at reducing the use of cadmium, chromium (hexavalent), lead and cyanide. There is a substantial increase in commercial formulations for alloy electrodeposits, especially where those alloys may be used as a substitute for more toxic coatings.

STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONALLY THICK CHROMIUM ELECTRODEPOSITS FROM A TRIVALENT ELECTROLYTE - A &quot; GREEN &quot; TECHNOLOGY:</B> <I>Christian E. Johnson</I>, Jasper L. Mullen National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg MD 20899
<P>
Chromium is widely used as an electrochemically applied coating on metal for wear resistance, to reduce friction, or for a desired appearance. In present <BR>
 commercial electroplating processes, the chromium is deposited from electrolytes in which it is in the hexavalent state. With recent interest in seeking alternatives to the toxic Cr6+, a process has been developed to deposit thick chromium coatings from a non-toxic trivalent electrolyte. The coatings deposited from this electrolyte are an alloy of chromium-carbon-oxygen-hydrogen having an amorphous structure, as-deposited. However, with heat treatment they are transformed to a crystalline structure of chromium carbide in a chromium matrix. The hardness and resistance to wear increase with the transformation of this coating after heat treatment. The structure of the electrodeposited coatings, will be discussed. Property measurements of microhardness, wear and coefficient of thermal expansion will be discussed for the as-deposited and heat treated coatings.

COPING WITH UNINTENDED Cu ENRICHMENT DURING CONVERSION COATING OF MICROSTRUCTURALLY COMPLEX ALUMINUM:</B> <I>R.G. Buchheit</I>, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185
<P>
Copper is a major alloying element in engineering aluminum alloys. Cu is concentrated in second phase particles distributed throughout the alloy. The interaction of these particles with conversion coating solutions can result in enrichment of Cu on the treated surface. This enrichment has serious negative consequences on subsequent corrosion and adhesion properties. Direct examination using high resolution SEM shows that in 2024-T# Cu is segregated into large (2-6 micrometer) Al2CuMg particles. During surface finishing these particles experience severe dealloying and produce a fine dispersion of Cu-rich clusters that are distributed across the alloy surface facilitating galavanic corrosion during testing or service. Since redistribution of Cu across the surface is possible without ever oxidizing the Cu, mitigation schemes based on Cu complexing agent additions alone may be inadequate. However, mitigation schemes that utilize a Cu complexing agent and a sufficiently oxidizing solution can successfully prevent Cu enrichment and produce significant improvements in corrosion resistance.

ELECTRODEPOSITED Ni-Al PARTICLE COMPOSITE COATINGS:</B> <I> D.F. Susan</I>, K. Barmak, A.R. Marder Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University Bethlehem, PA 18015-3195
<P>
Electrodeposited metal matrix/metal particle composite coatings (EMMC's) were deposited, heat treated, and characterized. Nickel matrix/aluminum particulate coatings deposited on a nickel substrate was chosen as a model system. The microstructure of the as-plated and heat treated coatings was characterized using light optical microscopy (LOOM), SEM, quantitative image analysis (QIA), and EPMA. A schematic model is presented for coating morphological development during codeposition of small, electrically conducting particles. The heat treated coatings consist of a two phase mixture of y solid solution and Ni3Al (gamma-prime) with small Kirkendall voids also present. The hardness of the heat treated coatings increased with increasing Ni3Al content and remained constant with extended heat treatment time. Oxidation tests were performed isothermally in air at 800, 900, and 1000&#176;C for up to 900 hrs. and the depth of the oxidation attack was determined. Throughout the investigation, the Ni-Al coatings were compared to conventional pure Ni coatings deposited under similar conditions.

FORMATION OF THIN COLORED FILM ON STAINLESS STEEL:</B> <I>G.S.Gupta</I>, Dept. of Mining, Minerals and Materials Engineering, The University of Queensland, St.Lucia, Queensland - 4072, Australia
<P>
Formation of colored film on type 304 stainless steel has been studied using chromic acid and potassium dichromate solutions. Permanent colors have been obtained using immersion and electrolytic (potentiostatic) methods. The effect of different parameters on the coloring process including temperature, coloring methods, solution composition, stirring, surfactant etc., have been noted. Moderate temperature of the solution, electrolytic method, use of surfactant and stirring of the solution were found to enhance the coloring process. A coloring solution which is strongly oxidized and acidic in nature is recommended. It is advisable that after the extended use of the coloring solution, fresh solution should be used.

TRICATIONIC PHOSPHATE COATING ON GALVANNEALED STEEL SHEET:</B><I> Carlos Nelson Elias, </I>Mila Marques Justo, Escola de Engenharia Metaurgica de Volta Redonda, Av dos Trabalhadores 420, 27260 740 Volta Redonda, RJ - Brazil
<P>
The galvannealed compared to galvanized steel sheet has excellent paint adhesion, weldability and corrosion resistance after painting. However, the coating tends to cause exfoliation when undergoing severe deformation. This coating is used in the automobile industry. Since the mass loss is very large, it accumulates on the metal mold and results in severe damage to the surface quality of the formed panel affecting press workability and damaging the tool. Nevertheless, phosphating is the most widely used pretreatment, since it serves as an excellent paint base, increases corrosion resistance to metal paints, aids in cold forming of steel and increases the lubricant power of oil applied to the pieces subjected to friction and wear. The influence of galvannealed morphology on the phosphate crystal feature is not well understood. In this work, a tricationic phosphate coating was applied to a surface of a low carbon steel and an interstitial free steel with galvannealed coating. Our paper will discuss the structural and mechanical properties resulting from this treatment.

PROGRESS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF DENDRIMER-BASED PROTECTIVE COATING:</B> <I>Larry A. Milco, </I>Donald A Tomalia, Michigan Molecular Institute, 1910 W. St. Andrews Road, Midland, MI 48640-2696
<P>
There is a considerable demand for thin film coatings to which other substances will not stick. Coatings are required to protect surfaces from soils, stains, ice, graffiti, insects, oils, corrosion and chemical and biological contaminants. Moreover, as legislative pressures to remove volatile organic solvents from coating formulations persist, the demand for alternative water-borne systems continues to increase. The incorporation of dendritic polymers in non-stick coating formulation is a highly viable approach to overcoming the limitations associated with conventional polymer systems. Non-stick coatings were prepared by crosslinking dendrimers with linear polymers. The high advancing and receding contact angles and low contact angle hysteresis of water and hexadecane on the coatings are indicative of the non-stick (low adhesion) properties of these surfaces.

PULSED LASER DEPOSITION OF COLLAGEN AND APATITE/COLLAGEN COMPOSITE BIOCOMPATIBLE THIN FILMS:</B> J.A. Conklin,<I> C.M. Cotell</I>, Surface Modification Branch, Code 6671, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375
<P>
Thin films comprising either collagen or a composite of hydroxyapatite (HA) and collagen were deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on various substrates. Films were deposited using either a KrF (248nm) or ArF (193nm) excimer laser and the substrates were maintained at room temperature. Collagen films were characterized by SEM, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The functional groups on the collagen molecule remained intact through the laser ablation process, but there was evidence for some loss of secondary structure. In addition, the surface morphology was a function of the laser fluence and the gas environment during PLD. Less denaturation of the molecule was observed when the ablation was at 193nm than at 248nm. For the composite films, the target material consisted of a 70/30 (by weight) mixture of apatite/collagen, the same ratio found in bone. The resulting composite films were a homogenous mixture of amorphous collagen and highly crystalline apatite.

PROTEINS FROM OYSTER SHELL AS MODELS FOR BIODEGRADABLE COMMERCIAL POLYMERS:</B> <I>A.P. Wheeler</I>, Department of Biological Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634
<P>
Virtually all minerals formed by organisms are composites, containing an organic phase (matrix) which enhances the mechanical properties of the inorganic phase and which presumably controls mineral growth. The matrix of the CaCO3 shell of oysters contains soluble, highly anionic proteins which in vitro adsorb to mineral and in so doing alter mineral growth. Based on the surface reactive properties of these proteins, synthetic analogs have been made which have properties that make them candidates as inhibitors for mineral scale and corrosion and as dispersants. Synthesis of a simple matrix protein analog, polyaspartic acid, is possible on a significant scale using dry thermal polymerization and aspartic acid as the only reactant. Thermal polyaspartic acid is highly biodegradable when compared to polymers currently used for commercial surface reactive applications.

THE APPLICATION AND SUBSEQUENT CROSS-LINKING OF A BIOLOGICAL POLYMER ON ALUMINUM METAL:</B> <I>Douglas C. Hansen</I>, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375-5343
<P>
Biological polymers that are used by organisms in the formation of structural materials and protective coatings are widespread in nature. An example of such a polymer is the protein utilized by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis as a varnish coating on its byssal threads. This protein is of high molecular weight (&gt;100,000) and is unique in containing the catecholic amino acid L-dopa. This protein exhibits high affinity for metals and acts as a substrate for the enzyme catechol oxidase, which catalyzes the two electron oxidation of catechol to o-quinone. This reaction is essential in the formation of a two component sclerotized resin. The adsorption of this protein onto pure aluminum (99.99999%) and subsequent cross-linking of the adsorbed protein results in a significant shift in the critical pitting potential and polarization resistance of the treated aluminum. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements clearly show that treatment of the protein adsorbed onto Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) with catechol oxidase results in a stable, varnish-like coating.

ADSORPTION OF ADHESIVE PROTEINS FROM THE MARINE MUSSEL,<I> MYTILUS EDULIS</I>, ON POLYMER FILMS IN THE HYDRATED STATE USING ANGLE DEPENDENT XPS AND AFM:</B><I> A.M. Baty</I>, P.K. Leavitt, C.A. Siedlecki, B. J.Tyler, P.A.Suci, R.E. Marchant, G.G.Geesey. Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59717-0398
<P>
The adsorption of Mussel Adhesive Protein (MAP) from the marine mussel <I>Mytilus edulis</I> has been investigated on polystyrene (PS) and poly (octadecyl methacrylate) (POMA) surfaces using angle dependent XPS and AFM. XPS analysis was performed at LN temperatures without dehydrating the samples and at room temperature following dehydration. The analyses indicate that adsorbed MAP is stabilized on the surface of the PS through specific interactions preventing the protein from losing lateral spatial distribution across the surface upon dehydration. The adsorbed MAP on the POMA surface is representative of a loosely bound protein layer that is adsorbed through non-specific types of interactions allowing the protein to lose much of its lateral distribution when dehydrated. These data demonstrate that the surface chemistry of the polymer films influences protein-protein and protein-surface interactions, and that hydration plays a significant role in structuring protein-surface interactions.

TRIBOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT METHODS FOR COATINGS:</B> <I>Stephen M. Hsu,</I> National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899
<P>
Coatings are increasingly being used as a means to protect materials from harsh environments. As the coating technology becomes more sophisticated, the requirement for new and better measurement techniques to understand wear mechanisms and coating effectiveness soars. For functionally gradient coatings, the issue of measuring local properties vs global properties in determining the extent of compositional change necessary to achieve a particular performance level is critical. For very thin hard coatings on relatively soft substrates, the deformation and yielding of the substrate affect the coating effectiveness. This paper presents some new and novel techniques that can be used to measure the coating properties under rubbing conditions.

<P>
A variety of alloy and compound coatings can be synthesized using plasma-based techniques. At high target bias voltages, implantation of ions into the target can be achieved to dose levels sufficient to bring about beneficial surface modification. The range of compositions achievable, low processing temperatures and environmental cleanliness makes this technique potentially attractive for a number of applications.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN COATED SYSTEMS BY INSTRUMENTED INDENTATION:</B> <I>Larry Seitzman,</I> Code 6170 Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Vickers indentation was performed on a variety of coating-substrate combinations. Force-displacement curves were obtained by continuously monitoring the loading and unloading of the indentor. Different methodologies for analyzing the data (i.e. shape effect vs contact depth as well as regression vs polynomial fitting) were compared. Mechanical property profiles of the coated system were obtained from both the loading and the unloading curves, and the properties determined from both curves were compared. Analysis of the unloading curve readily yields hardness and elastic modulus data, while analysis of the loading curve yields additional information. The potential for using instrumented indentation as a quality control tool for coated systems will be discussed.

DAMAGE MECHANISM IN SOLID PARTICLE EROSION OF FeAl-Al203 THERMAL SPRAY COATINGS:</B> <I>Brian Schorr</I>, Arnold Marder, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015; Daniel Sordelet, Iowa State University, Ames Laboratory, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
The effect of microstructure and splat cohesion on the erosion damage mechanism of FeAl-Al203 plasma and high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) coatings was studied. The Al203 content in the cermet pre-sprayed powders was varied from 0-80%. Microstructural evaluation revealed a good correlation between the Al203 in the pre-sprayed powders and the final as deposited plasma coatings. In addition, increased porosity was measured as the Al203 content of the coatings increased. It was found that plasma sprayed coatings tend to fail via splat delamination due to poor cohesion and high porosity, providing accelerated weight loss compared to HVOF and wrought alloys. The addition of Al203 to the plasma sprayed FeAl increased the erosion rate of the tested coatings. Examination of the eroded surfaces revealed cracking of the Al203 which led to undercutting of the FeAl matrix. In contrast, partial removal of splats by gouging as well as cracking occurred in the HVOF coatings.

PLASMA NITRIDING OF TOOL STEELS:</B> <I>Sun K. Kim</I>, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Kyung Nam, Korea 680-749
<P>
In order to produce composite surface layers by combining nitriding and coating of titanium compounds, nitriding of tool steels to obtain only diffusion layer on surface is desirable. In this paper, results on experiments to obtain a diffusion layer with zero or minimum amount of compound layer were presented. With SKD11, SKD61 and SKH9 tool steels, experimental process parameters such as hydrogen and nitrogen gas ratios, temperature, pressure and time were changed to obtain an optimum condition.

<P>
Ti-45.0 at% Al-1.6% Mn intermetallic compounds, which were fabricated by reactive sintering, were boronized in the temperature range 1150 to 1250&#176;C under a flow of Ar gas in a graphite pack with boron carbide (B4C) powders. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the phase present in the coating layer. The coating layer was composed of Ti2B, TiB, and Al2Ti4C2 phases. The formation mechanism of the above compounds in the coating layer was investigated. Some vacancies were found below the coating layer. The thickness of the coating layer increased with increasing boronizing temperature and time. The activation energy of formation of the coating layer was calculated to be 320 Kj/mole. The microhardness of the coating layer was extremely high (700-800 Hv), compared to that (300-400Hv) of the substrate, improving the resistance to wear and high-temperature oxidation.

THE WEAR-RESISTANCE OF TiNi INTERMETALLICS WITH TiN COATING:</B> <I>H.C. Lin</I>, H.M. Liao, J.L. He, K.M. Lin, K.C. Chen, Department of Materials Science, Feng Chia University. Taichung, Taiwan 407, China
<P>
The wear resistance of TiNi intermetallics with TiN coating was studied by wear test, hardness measurement, XRD and microstructure observation. Both TiN and Ti2Ni layers are found to form on the surface of ion-nitrided TiNi intermetallics. These layers can improve the wear-resistance of these TiNi intermetallics. The effects of nitriding temperatures, TiN/Ti2Ni thickness and applied wear-load on the wear behavior of TiNi intermetallics are investigated in this paper. Meanwhile, the major wear mechanisms in these ion-nitrided TiNi intermetallics are also discussed.

THE USE OF ION BEAM SURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES FOR CORROSION PROTECTION:</B> <I>P.M. Natishan</I>, E. McCafferty, G.K. Hubler, B.D. Sartwell. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375<P>
Ion beam alloying techniques overcome many of the problems associated with conventional alloying and provide a means to produce new and unique corrosion resistant alloys. These techniques can be used to tailor metal surfaces to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface without affecting the bulk properties of the metal. In addition, novel metastable phases unattainable by conventional alloying can be produced, and scarce or critical materials can be conserved since only the surface of the metal is alloyed. This paper will discuss advances in and issues related to various ion beam alloying techniques including ion implantation, ion beam mixing and ion beam assisted deposition as related to their application to corrosion protection.

CORROSION RESISTANT ALLOYS AND COATINGS PRODUCED BY PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION:</B><I> Barbara Shaw</I>, Elzbieta Sikora, Tim Miller, Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802<P>
Evaporation techniques, such as PVD and CVD are increasing in popularity as methods for tailoring surface properties for specific engineering applications. One of the attributes of PVD is the ease with which graded, layered and nonequilibrium coatings and alloys can be produced. Not surprisingly, defects, coating morphology and deposit composition strongly influence deposit properties such as strength and corrosion resistance. As an example of how passivity enhancing species influence corrosion resistance, the addition of 8 at% Mo to Al (via electron beam PVD) was found to increase the pitting potential 600mV over that of pure Al. Similar enhancements have been observed with Al-Ta alloys. In addition to the constant composition deposits, graded and layered coatings can also be used to improve corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. In this presentation, the results of an ongoing investigation of nonequilibrium Al and Mg deposits ( both constant and graded composition deposits) produced via electron beam PVD will be presented and discussed.

THE ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF METAL SURFACES SUBJECTED TO PULSED ION BEAM SURFACE TREATMENT:</B> <I>N.R. Sorensen1</I>, R.G. Buchheit1, K.S. Grabowski2, T.R.

Box 5800 Albuquerque, NM 87185; 2Naval Research laboratory, Code 6670, Washington, DC 20375; 3Department of Materials Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853<P>
Pulsed high energy ion beams have been used to thermally treat metal surfaces to alter their electrochemical response. Two general processing regimens have been explored: 1) rapid melt and resolidification (RMR) and 2) ion beam mixing (IBM). RMR uses the pulsed ion beam to melt and in some cases ablate the top most several microns of the surface. Subsequent solidification is sufficiently fast (&gt;106K/s) for nonequilibrium structures and compositions to be attained. IBM uses the ion beam to mix a previously applied metallic layer into the substrate to produce a compositionally and structurally distinct surface alloy. The surface that results from these treatments often displays interesting characteristics. For example, a Grade-2 Ti sample, which pits at a potential of 1.7V, is immune to pitting up to 2V following ion beam treatment. This talk will discuss the changes in electrochemical behavior of several alloys following ion beam treatment.

CORROSION INHIBITION MECHANISMS IN EPOXY COATED ALUMINUM:</B> <I> R.D. Granata</I>, R.C. MacQueen, R.R. Miron, M.M. Madani Zettlemoyer, Center for Surface Studies, Lehigh University, 7 Asa Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18015<P>
Corrosion inhibition mechanisms in model systems were evaluated for use in barrier-type protective polymeric coatings systems. Emphasis was on complaint, low VOC coatings applications technologies such as powder coatings, UV-cured and electrocoating systems on aluminum substrates. Candidate inhibitor systems wee studied using low VOC epoxy polymer and porous polymer films on conversion coated, aluminum alloy 2024. Inhibition in these systems was observed in short exposure times. The model defect systems were studied using electrochemical impedance and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopies. The positron lifetime measurements determined free volume cavity sizes and concentrations through which corrosion-active species diffuse. Electrochemically active and inactive (positron accessible) regions within the polymer matrix were monitored versus water saturation. Corrosion inhibitors modified the polymer matrix barrier properties in regions adjacent to the filler particles. Inhibition processes will be discussed relative to known mechanisms.

CYCLIC OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF AN ALUMINIDE COATING FORMED ON DESULFURIZED Ni-BASED SUPERALLOYS BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION:</B> <I>Y. Zhang</I>1, W.Y. Lee2, K.M. Cooley2, I.G. Wright2, P.K. Liaw1; 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; 2Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831<P>
The cyclic oxidation behavior of Ni-based superalloys can be significantly improved by lowering the level of sulfur impurities in the alloys to below ~1 ppm. This presentation addresses the feasibility of preparing a low-sulfur bond coat, which would be compatible with desulfurized single-crystal superalloys and therefore could be attractive for possible use in advanced thermal barrier coating applications. Rene N5 substrates containing ~3 ppm and ~0.4 ppm sulfur were aluminized using a chemical vapor deposition technique. The level of sulfur incorporated into the aluminide coating was measured as a function of coating thickness by glow discharge mass spectroscopy. The effects of the sulfur content on the cyclic oxidation behavior of the aluminized substrates and the morphological stability at the scale-coating interface were studied and compared.

AN XPS STUDY OF THE ROLE OF NITROGEN IN OXYANION FORMATION DURING AQUEOUS CORROSION OF MOLYBDENUM AND CHROMIUM NITRIDE COATINGS:</B> <I>G. Halada</I>, C.

Demaree, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5069<P>
A dual electrode electrochemical approach, in combination with variable angle X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, was used to determine the role of nitrogen in the generation of oxyanionic species, MoO42- and CrO42-, from MoN and CrN coatings. During simultaneous anodic polarization of a coupling of Fe and either pure Mo and Cr or their respective nitrides in deaerated 0.1M HCl, the presence of nitrogen was found to enhance the formation of molybdate and chromate oxyanions. These oxyanions deposited back onto the nitride surfaces as insoluble salts formed with cations released from the iron electrode. The increased formation of oxyanions is postulated to be the result of deprotonation of electrolyte in contact with the nitride coating and a subsequent shift in pH to higher values. In addition to acting as a kinetic barrier, the oxyanionic species act as an electrostatic barrier to the ingress of the Cl- anions which cause pitting.

A STUDY OF THE PASSIVATION MECHANISM IN HIGHLY CORROSION RESISTANT &quot;STAINLESS STEEL&quot; ALLOY COATINGS FORMED USING THE JVDTM PROCESS:</B> <I>Clive R. Clayton,</I> M.E. Monserrat, G.P.

Halpern, Jet Process Corporation, 24 Science Park, New Haven, CT 06511<P>
Recently we reported the formation of highly corrosion resistant &quot;stainless steel&quot; based alloy coatings formed using the JVD process. In this paper, a detailed study aimed at obtaining a fundamental understanding of the passivation mechanisms operating in these alloy coatings is reported. Passivation behavior of the coatings was determined by electrochemical polarization in 4.0M and 0.1M solutions respectively. The surface chemistry of the coatings was studied using XPS and correlated to the observed passivation behavior.

ELECTRODE MATERIALS FOR LITHIUM BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS:</B> <I>A. Manthiram</I>, Center for Materials Science and Engineering, ETC 9.104, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712
<P>
Electrically conducting metal oxides find potential applications in electrochemical systems such as batteries and fuel cells. For example, several lithium insertion compounds are used as cathodes in rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the battery performance and cyclability of the cathodes are controlled partly by the microstructure and morphology, which in turn are influenced by the methods of synthesis and processing used. A novel approach involving the reduction of aqueous metallate solutions with aqueous alkali metal borohydrides at ambient temperatures to obtain amorphous or nanocrystalline transition metal oxide electrodes will be presented. The electrode performance of, for example, amorphous or nanocrystalline VO2, CrO2, MoO2, and LiMn2O4 will be discussed. In addition, the design and synthesis of perovskite-based metal oxides that exhibit mixed electronic and ionic conductivity will be presented. These mixed conductors are attractive not only as electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells but also for oxygen separation membranes and catalysts.

EPITAXIAL THIN FILMS AND HETEROSTRUCTURES OF METALLIC OXIDES FOR DEVICE APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>C.B. Eom</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708
<P>
For many electronic device applications, it is necessary to have epitaxial growth of metallic oxide thin films in a single heterostructure. We have grown epitaxial thin films of Sr1-xCaxRuO3 and La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20 in-situ by 90 degree off-axis sputtering. These metallic oxides are pseudo-cubic perovskites, which could be ideal electrodes for ferroelectric devices, and normal metal barriers for SNS junctions in integrated superconducting devices. However, the properties of epitaxial thin films of the metallic oxides may be quite different from the corresponding bulk materials because of the existence of strain and cation disorder in the films. We have observed a strain stabilized metal-insulator transition in epitaxial Sr1-xCaxRuO3 thin films deposited on (100) SrTiO3 substrates that differed in crystalline quality. The growth mechanisms of the films and their correlation with the crystalline quality of the substrates is discussed. We have also grown epitaxial planar SNS heterostructures YBCO/La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20/YBCO. We will discuss the microstructures, junction properties and the origin of the interface resistance between YBCO and La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20.

FUNDAMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CADMIUM STANNATE THIN FILMS:</B> <I>T.J. Coutts</I>, W.P. Mulligan, X. Wu, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO 80215
<P>
We are investigating a variety of novel transparent conductive oxides, including cadmium stannate (Cd2SnO4), cadmium indate (CdIn2O4), zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4 and ZnSnO3), and zinc indium oxide (Zn2In2O5). To date, the cadmium stannate films have shown the highest conductivity, with resistivities as low as 1.3X10-4 ohm-cm. Films have been fabricated with sheet resistances as low 2 ohm/sq., while maintaining approximately 80% transmittance across the visible and near infrared. The conductivity of the films is high because of both high electron concentration and relatively high electron mobility. One possible explanation for the high mobility is that the electron effective mass is unusually low. Direct measurement of the effective mass by cyclotron resonance is not feasible due to the extremely short electron scattering times characteristic of these highly defective materials. Instead, we have estimated effective mass by Drude modelling of optical reflectance and transmittance data, and by analysis of a combination of electron transport measurements, including resistivity, Hall effect, thermopower, and transverse Nernst-Ettingshausen effect. Cadmium stannate films with a range of carrier concentrations were fabricated, and their optical and transport properties were measured. We will present the results of our comparative analysis of carrier effective mass by these two independent methods. Possible conduction band curvature, and carrier scattering time and mechanisms will also be reported. The implications for design of novel transparent conductive oxides will be discussed.

ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE POLYMERS:</B> <I>M.E. Galvin</I>, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ 07974
<P>
It has been known for two decades that polymers with extended conjugation could be rendered highly conductive by doping, that is, by oxidizing or reducing the polymer chain. The commercialization of these polymers has, however, been limited by their poor chemical stability in the doped form. More recently these polymers have shown promise when used in their undoped forms in LEDs, light emitting diodes, or in thin film transistors. This talk will cover the recent developments in these two areas and describe the scientific challenges which still remain.

Anisotropic electrical conductivity with many orders of magnitude change along different directions can be obtained by the design of novel, composite structures. Materials with such characteristics are useful for a variety of electronic applications including ultra-high density circuit interconnections, 3-D packaging, and solder-free interconnection. Optically transparent but electrically conductive medium can also be made via composite route. Novel composite structures with vertically aligned metal elements in ceramic or polymer sheets will be described. Materials fabrication process, electrical properties and reliability issues will also be discussed.

OPTICAL STUDIES FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CONDUCTING POLYMERS:</B> <I>L.M. Abrantes</I>, CECUL, Dept. Qumica, FCUL, Bloco C1-5 piso, 1700 Lisboa, Portugal; J.P. Correia, INETI, Dept. de Energias Renovaveis, 1699 Lisboa Codex, Portugal
<P>
The properties of conducting polymers have stimulated much interest in many fields of research and considerable effort has been directed towards reliable characterization of the envisaged properties for commercial applications. Apart from polyacetylene (PA) the major existing conducting polymers can be electrochemically synthesized and this encouraged the use of conventional electrochemical methods coupled to other techniques to study the electropolymerization and insulator/conductor conversion of these new materials. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ability of optical methods to provide useful information on the properties of electronically conducting polymers. Three techniques will be focused and their contribution illustrated considering different systems: 1. The principles of the Probe Beam Deflection (also known as Mirage Effect) and respective data for polyaniline (PANI) systems discussed. 2. Recent applications of Photocurrent Spectroscopy are reviewed and photoeffects displayed by poly-3-methylthiophene (P3MeTh) analysed. 3. The information on structural changes during electropolymerization and doping processes, which can be provided by ellipsometry evidenced by the study of PANI, P3MeTh and polypyrrole.

HYDROSTATICALLY EXTRUDED COPPER-NIOBIUM SPARK ERODED POWDER:</B> <I>M.A. Hill</I>, J.F. Bingert, F.E. Spada, A.E. Berkowitz, S.A. Bingert, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093
<P>
High strength, high conductivity copper-niobium wire is a promising conductor wire for use in pulsed high field magnets. Due to the high melting point of niobium, it is difficult to produce an ingot with a fine, homogeneous structure. One possibility for reducing the scale of the cast structure, improving the homogeneity of the ingot, and enhancing the strength at a given level of deformation strain is to use rapid solidification techniques, such as powder processing, to fabricate the Cu-Nb ingot. Both melt spinning and gas atomization of Cu-Nb are difficult due to problems associated with thermal shock of components, such as crucibles and stopper rods. Spark erosion provides a method for powder production without the use of components which may crack under thermal stresses. Furthermore, in the spark erosion process quench rates exceeding 106 K/s from temperatures above 104 K promote formation of fine particles with homogeneous composition. Spark eroded Cu-10 vol % Nb powder has been consolidated by cold pressing and subsequently hydrostatically extruded to form 2.5 cm diameter rod with a yield strength of 500 MPa and a conductivity of 85% IACS at a reduction of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">=2.6.

TRANSITION METAL CARBIDES AND NITRIDES FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES:</B> <I>Wendell S. Williams</I>, Department of Physics, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
The need for thermally stable, diffusion-resistant but electronically conducting materials for interconnects in ultra large scale integrated circuits has led to the successful application of transition metal carbides and nitrides, particularly TiN. Another application is the use of superconducting NbN to make Josephson junctions NbN/Si/Nb and Nb/MgO/NbN. And high-temperature resistors with nearly zero temperature coefficients have been made from TaN. This family of materials, sometimes called &quot;metallic ceramics,&quot; can be deposited as thin films by several processes, including reactive sputtering, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition and plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. An interesting but potentially troublesome characteristic of these NaCl-structured materials is their wide range of deviation from stoichiometry, involving many percent random atomic vacancies, scattering centers for conduction electrons. Hence film preparation requires that the non-metal/metal ratio be close to unity. It is not widely recognized that these defect-ridden crystal structures are non-equilibrium phases: when cooled slowly from high temperatures, some develop ordered phases with lower resistivities.

<P>ELECTROMIGRATION IN SUBMICRON Al-0.5% Cu INTERCONNECTS FOR SILICON ULSI:</B> <I>J.A. Prybyla</I>, S.P. Riege, A.W. Hunt, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ 07974
<P>
Systematic studies of the influence of local microstructure on electromigration (EM) dynamics in submicron Al(0.5 wt % Cu) interconnects were performed using in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. This approach has allowed us to observe in real-time voids forming, growing, migrating, pinning, failing a runner, and healing, all with respect to the detailed local microstructure of the runners. Here we will report and describe how grain boundaries dramatically influence almost all aspects of EM-induced void and failure dynamics in submicron runners. We also find a striking change in EM-mechanism as a function of temperature in the range 200-300&#176;C. Studies as a function of linewidth and passivation state were also performed. Our findings have important implications for both electromigration modeling and conventional reliability testing.

<P>DOPANT ACTIVATION OF HEAVILY-DOPED Si BY HIGH CURRENT DENSITY:</B> J.S. Huang <I>K. N. Tu</I>, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1595
<P>
Novel dopant activation in the heavily boron-doped p+-Si was created by applying an electrical current of high current density. The heavily boron-doped p+-Si was obtained by ion implantation and annealed at 900&#176;C for 30 min to achieve a partial boron activation. For additional activation, we gradually applied current until a current density of 2.5X10E7 A/cm2 was reached. The resistance of the p+-Si responded by a gradual increase, then it decreased with a precipitous drop. The resistance was reduced by a factor of 5 to 18. Mechanisms of the novel dopant activation will be proposed. Dopant activation in the heavily arsenic-doped n+-Si will also be discussed.

<P>DEVELOPMENT OF LOW THERMAL-EXPANSION, HIGH-CONDUCTIVITY ALLOYS BASED ON THE Cu-Fe-Ni TERNARY SYSTEM:</B> R.D. Cottle, R.K. Jain, C.C. Hays, Z. Eliezer, <I>L. Rabenberg,</I> Center for Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712; M.E. Fine, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208
<P>
The FCC phase in Cu-Fe-Ni ternary system contains a miscibility gap within which tie-lines extend from nearly pure Cu toward the Invar composition, Fe - 36% Ni. This suggests that it should be possible to prepare alloys containing isotropic distributions of Invar within high conductivity, Cu-rich, matrices, and that the Invar fraction can be controlled by selecting starting compositions at various points along the tie line. The resulting combinations of low thermal expansion with high electrical and thermal conductivity will be of interest in the electronic circuit packaging industry. Technical difficulties in developing such alloys arise from incomplete solid solubility at high temperatures at the Cu-rich end of the series and from the slow approach to complete chemical phase separation at low temperatures. Quaternary element additions and mechanical deformation processes are being explored as approaches to creating more nearly homogeneous starting alloys. Microstructural developments and electrical and thermal properties will be reported and discussed.

<P>PROCESS OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH-STRENGTH, HIGH-CONDUCTIVITY Cu-Cr IN-SITU COMPOSITE:</B> <I>H. G. Suzuki</I>, K. Adachi, S. Tsubokawa, T. Takeuchi, National Research Institute for Metals, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba 305, Japan
<P>
<P>High-strength, high-conductivity Cu-Cr in-situ composites were developed through the optimization of various process variables. Ingots were obtained by vacuum induction melting. Dendritic Cr was in-situ precipitated during solidification. After hot forging and solution treatment at 1000C, repeated cold working was performed to get fine lamellar spacing of single crystalline Cr second phase. The analysis of microstructure by TEM showed dynamic recrystallization of Cu matrix and fine distribution of Cr precipitates. These structures give the strength level of 900 MPa and relative conductivity, IACS, of 78%. The mechanism of high strength and high conductivity will be discussed.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND PRECIPITATION OF Cr BY AGING IN Cu-Cr IN-SITU COMPOSITE:</B> <I>J. Yan, </I>H.G. Suzuki, National Research Institute for Metals, 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsukuba 305, Japan
<P>
Aging treatment is one of the most important materials processing techniques for obtaining high electrical conductivity in Cu in-situ composite. In this work, we systematically investigated the effect of Cr precipitation on electrical conductivity of a Cu-15 wt % Cr in-situ composite, by means of aging treatment, electrical conductivity measurement, scanning electron microscopy, analytical electron microscopy, high resolution electron microscopy and X-ray lattice parameter measurement. The optimum aging condition for obtaining peak electrical conductivity has been determined. In addition, it is found that an appropriate amount of cold working can further enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite. The related mechanism has also been studied.

PROCESSING OF CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED Ti-ALLOY MMCS BY PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION: </B> P. R. Subramanian, S. Krishnamurthy, and S. Keller, UES, Inc., Materials and Processes Division, 4401 Dayton-Xenia Rd., Dayton, OH 45432-1894<P>
Fiber-reinforced titanium aluminide composites are of particular interest as candidate materials for aerospace structural applications at moderately high temperatures. Conventional techniques for fabrication of these composites pose many technical challenges, and serve as one of the barriers to the practical use of these composite systems. The present work deals with a novel vapor synthesis route, the matrix-coated fiber process, for producing Ti-alloy metal matrix composites (MMCs). In this process, the matrix alloy is directly deposited on continuous SiC fibers by hollow-cathode magnetron sputtering. The matrix-coated fibers are then consolidated to produce unidirectionally reinforced MMC panels. Details of the processing technique will be presented, along with results on microstructural evolution. Results from room-temperature mechanical evaluation of the MMC specimens will also be presented. This research is funded by the U.S. Air Force as a Small Business Innovative Research Program under Contract No. F33615-94-C-5214 . Program Monitor: Dr. Stephen W. Schwenker, USAF Wright Laboratory, Materials Directorate (WL/MLLM), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7817.

COMBUSTION CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CCVD) OF LaPO4 MONAZITE ON ALUMINA FIBERS FOR CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> T.J. Hwang, M.R. Hendrick, H. Shao, H.G. Hornis, A.T. Hunt, Micro Coating Technologies, 430 Tenth Street, Suite N-108, Atlanta, GA 30318<P>
It has been demonstrated that monazite compounds can serve as an oxidation protection and crack deflecting interface coatings to improve the strength and toughness in oxide-oxide ceramic matrix composite. In this study, lanthanum phosphate LaPO4 (monatize) was coated on alumina fibers (Nextel 610) using the combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVDSM) method in the open atmosphere. This study has shown that the CCVD is feasible for applying a dense LaPO4 coating while moving the fiber tows through the deposition zone. A systematic stoichiometry study showed that monazite was the predominate phase in the film. Deposition temperatures were controlled to prevent degradation of fibers while maintaining an optimal deposition rate and coating quality. Several interlayer materials were investigated to minimize the reaction and recrystallization of the A12O3 fibers. Since a vacuum chamber is not required for the CCVD process, large scale, continuous coating of fibers is possible.

DENSE TITANIUM MATRIX COMPOSITE MONOTAPE FROM E-BEAM METAL COATED FIBERS:</B> Herve Deve, Metal Matrix Composites Program, 3M Center, Bldg 60-1N-01, St Paul, MN 55144-1000<P>
The high temperature specific strength and stiffness of titanium matrix composites (TMC's) make them very attractive for the next generation of jet engine components. Significant efforts are now underway at 3M to reduce the cost of TMC's; bring them to a production status; and offer the customer a TMC precursor that will be easy to integrate into titanium components. The recent advances in the production of metal coated fibers by electron beam evaporation have allowed the development of continuous dense monotape. Dense TMC monotape will facilitate the fabrication of complex curved parts such as rings. A dense monotape is a single composite ply made by roll-bonding cylindrical metal coated fibers. Continuous roll-bonding allows the low-cost fabrication of TMC tape that do not contain organic binders. Monotapes have been produced that are typically 200 =B5m thick by 10 mm wide and greater than 30 meter long. The flexible composite tape can be easily laid-up on flat or curved parts. Final bonding of the component requires a HIP or diffusion bonding cycle without the complex removal of organic binders. TMC rings with a nearly perfect fiber distribution were fabricated to illustrate the simplicity of use of TMC monotapes.

REACTIVE SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS: MODELING DISPERSOID VOLUME FRACTION AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION:</B> J.-P. Delplanque, E.J. Lavernia, R.H. Rangel, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-2575<P>
Reactive spray atomization and deposition combines atomization, chemical reaction and consolidation into a single step. It offers a unique opportunity for in-situ, continuous control over alloy composition and chemical reaction between atomized droplets and reactive atomization gas. During reactive spray deposition a molten alloy is atomized by using a reactive gas mixture. The atomized droplets are subsequently deposited on a substrate. Chemical reactions occur between the matrix material and the reactive gas during both atomization and deposition. By carefully selecting alloying additive and reactive gas combinations on the basis of containing in-situ dispersoids such as carbides, nitrides, and oxides, leading to grain refinement. The volume frac
 tion and the size distribution of the dispersoids is critical to the grain refinement mechanisms. The primary goal of the present work is to define a model to estimate these characteristics. The materials considered are aluminum alloys while target dispersoids are primarily oxides. These may be obtained by the reaction of oxygen containing atomization gas mixtures with molten alloy droplets or with minor alloy additives which exhibit a high affinity for oxygen. Droplet position and velocity histories are obtained from the numerical solution of the one-dimensional equation of motion. The energy equation inside the droplet is solved numerically using finite-differences to predict the spatially resolved temperature field. The solid/liquid interface progression rate is estimated using a power law. The effect of the dispersiods on the achievable undercooling is included. This model is then used to determine the parameters controlling the volume fraction and the size distribution of the dispersiods.

PLASMA SPRAYED MULTI-LAYERED AND FUNCTIONALLY GRADED MATERIALS:</B> <I>H. Herman</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794<P>
Multi-layered (MLM) and functionally graded (FGM) composites display discrete or continuously varying compositions of metals, ceramics and polymers and/or microstructures over definable geometrical orientations and distances. Plasma spray offers a flexible and economic means for producing non-uniform composites and is used to apply layered and graded deposits to enhance the survivability of thick ceramic coatings (e.g., TBCs). These &quot;graded coatings&quot; are primarily applied to reduce CTE mismatch-related failure. The versatility of plasma spray allows the processing of a wide range of high performance materials, including most metals and refractory ceramics, under a controlled atmosphere if desired. Using plasma spray, it is possible to deposit multiple constituents simultaneously, thus providing a unique means of producing FGMs. Plasma spray MLM/FGM production will be discussed and the characteristics and properties of two FGM systems, Ni-Al2O3 and NiCrAlY-ZrO2, will be presented. This research is supported by NIST-Caterpillar Advanced Technology Program and the INEL University Research Consortium.

SOL-GEL SYNTHESIS OF CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> E.D. Rodeghiero, <I>E.P. Giannelis</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853<P>
Sol-gel techniques provided new and powerful means by which to synthesize oxide-based ceramic matrix composites. The advantages of sol-gel approaches relative to conventional powder processing are numerous. First, sol-gel synthesis can achieve extremely fine (nanoscale) microstructures with high degrees of dispersion between the matrix and reinforcement phases. In addition, the chemical compositions of the various phases can be precisely controlled. Furthermore, gel-derived composites are also highly uniform, as a result of eliminating powder mixing and segregation problems. Finally, sol-gel synthesis can reduce consolidation temperatures significantly, leading to more efficient, economical processing. This talk will present the results of our work in synthesizing both Ni/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Al2O3 metal-ceramic composites and SiC(whisker)/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Al2O3 ceramic-ceramic composites. The unique physical and mechanical properties of these composites in their various forms will be discussed, as well as their potential applications.

NANOCOMPOSITE MATERIALS VIA CHEMICAL ROUTES:</B> <I>Kenneth E. Gonsalves</I>, X. Chen, Department of Chemistry &amp; Institute of Materials Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269<P>
The formation of an AlN/Polyimide (PI) nanocomposite was achieved by the rapid solidification of the precursor suspension, followed by compression molding. Such an approach for nanocomposites exhibits improved homogeneity with ultrafine fillers and allows a tailorable composition and property at the nanoscale level. AlN/PI nanocomposites with an increased ceramic loading up to 50% by volume were attained and their thermal and mechanical properties, along with the compositional effects, were investigated.

PRESSURE INFILTRATION TECHNIQUE FOR SYNTHESIS OF ALUMINUM-FLY ASH PARTICULATE COMPOSITES:</B> P.K. Rohatgi, R Q. Guo, H. Iksan, R. Asthana, Materials Department, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201
<P>
Aluminum - fly ash composite was prepared by pressure infiltration technique. Loosely packed beds of cenosphere fly ash (above 55 vol% in the composite) can be successfully infiltrated by molten aluminum under pressure in the range of 0.3-0.7 MPa, and the density of the composite is 1.4 g /cm3 compared to the density 2.68g/cm3 for aluminum. Cenosphere fly ash particles are very light materials (density: 0.4 - 0.6 g/cm3). The microstructure of composite showed that there was uniform distribution of fly ash particles in the aluminum matrix. The mechanism of pressure infiltration and the reaction between aluminum and fly ash during infiltration and solidification will be discussed. Selected properties including hardness, microhardness, and compressive strength of aluminum - fly ash composites were determined and the results are presented in this paper.

WETTABILITY OF NICKEL COATED GRAPHITE BY ALUMINUM:</B> <I>S. W. Ip</I>, R. Sridhar, J.M.

Roy Gordon Research Laboratory, 2060 Flavelle Boulevard, Mississauga, ONT, Canada L5K 1Z9
<P>
Graphite is a very attractive candidate for aluminum MMC's. However, aluminum does not wet graphite. Thus the production of aluminum-graphite composite is difficult. Nickel is a material known to be wetted by aluminum. INCO Limited recently has developed a novel technique for coating graphite fibres with nickel. It was found that such coating promotes aluminum wetting on the fibres. To determine the wettability of aluminum on nickel coated graphite, the sessile drop technique along with a high temperature x-ray setup was used. Samples of graphite, electrolytic nickel, and nickel coated graphite were examined. Contact angles determined for these samples showed that graphite is non-wetting while the nickel coated graphite provided better wetting than electrolytic nickel. The nickel-aluminum interface of the samples were examined microscopically using SEM.

IN SITU PROCESSING OF TiB2/Cu-ALLOY COMPOSITES BY REACTIVE PRESSURELESS INFILTRATION (RPI):</B> <I>V. Shtessel</I>, M. Koczak (deceased), Department of Materials Engineering; R. Mutharasan, Department of Chemical Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
The process of Reactive Pressureless Infiltration (RPI) for in situ synthesis of Cu-Mn/TiB2 composites from elemental powders has been investigated. Primary factors, which alter phase composition and microstructure of the MMCs are enthalpy and relative free energy of reinforcement formation, initial powder size, processing temperatures and matrix wettability of the reinforcement. The Cu-Mn/TiB2 composite material was synthesized by matrix assisted displacement reactions, where the desired reinforcement forms gradually as a result of liquid infiltration and reaction. A weak boride former, e.g. Mn, is mixed with B in the bottom layer and infiltrated with Cu-Ti alloys. The process involves two consecutive steps: (1) formation of weak boride, e.g. Mn + 2B -&gt; MnB2; (2) displacement reactions, e.g. MnB2 + Ti-Cu -&gt; TiB2 + Cu-Mn. This route is advantageous due to improved wettability of Mn compounds by copper. Composites with 5, 7 10, 15, 20 and 30v/o of TiB2 have been produced and their microstructures and mechanical properties are being evaluated. Typical microstructures illustrate an even distribution of 0.5 - 5 micron particulates of TiB2. Possible mechanisms of the microstructure development during the process of reactive infiltration were analyzed. The study demonstrates that TiB2 forms by interfacial reaction: Ti + MnB2 = TiB2 + Mn. A kinetic model of the process has been proposed. The model enables us to determine the infiltration rate, the thickness of reacted layer as a function of time, the rate of reaction of TiB2 formation, the concentration profile of each component in the reactive layer. The model shows good agreement with experimental results. The RPI process is a promising technique for in situ, net-shape manufacturing of Cu-based MMCs.

<P>
Ceramic composite systems based on all-oxide constituents are of interest for high temperature applications owing to their inherent oxidative stability but must also be designed to exhibit damage tolerance. One microstructural design concept relies on crack deflection through a porous matrix rather than at fiber/matrix interfaces, which is the more conventional approach to toughening in CMC's. The requisite matrix must have an optimum combination of toughness and strength which can be achieved by incorporating a minimum amount of fine, well distributed porosity, and must also be chemically and microstructurally stable at high temperatures. Composites based on this concept have been synthesized using vacuum infiltration of aqueous mullite-alumina slurries into woven polycrystalline alumina fiber preforms, followed by precursor impregnation and sintering. Initial evaluation of these materials shows promising behavior under tension and potential for notch insensitivity and thermal stress tolerance. Current understanding of the underlying mechanisms as well as microstructural design and processing issues relevant to the attainment of this behavior will be discussed.

DENSE IN-SITU TiB2/TiN AND TiB2/TiC CMCS: REACTIVE SYNTHESIS AND PROPERTIES:</B> I. Gotman, F. Olevsky, <I>E.Y. Gurmanas</I>, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa 32000, Israel
<P>
In-Situ TiB2/TiN and TiB2/TiC CMCs were fabricated from fully dense BN-Ti and B4C-Ti powder blends with and without the addition of Ni powder. Three different methods were used: pressureless and pressure-assisted displacement reaction synthesis and thermal explosion under pressure. Application of a moderate external pressure (&#190; 200 MPa) was shown to be sufficient to ensure full density of TiB2/TiN/Ni and TiB2/TiC/Ni composites. The addition of Ni powder allowed to significantly reduce the ignition temperature of thermal explosion due to the formation of the low temperature Ti-Ni eutectic phase. Thus, the preheating temperature or thermal explosion, as well as the processing temperatures of displacement reaction synthesis (&#190; 1200&#176;C) were considerably lower than those typical of current methods used for the processing/consolidation of CMCs. Microstructure and composition of materials obtained were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Mechanical properties were evaluated by measuring microhardness, fracture toughness and three-point bending strength. High fracture toughness of TiB2/TiN/Ni and TiB2/TiC/Ni CMCs was obtained indicating that fine Ni dispersions are effective in dissipating the energy of propagating cracks.

INTERMETALLIC MATRIX COMPOSITES PREPARED BY MECHANICAL ATTRITION: A REVIEW:</B> <I>Carl C. Koch</I>, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695
<P>
The interest in intermetallic matrix composites has grown in recent years due to the realization that monolithic intermetallics would not likely satisfy the balance of properties needed for advanced aerospace systems. Processing of intermetallic matrix composites is a critical issue and a number of methods have been explored to fabricate such composites with either continuous or discontinuous reinforcements. While the latter category in general provides less improvement in mechanical behavior, this is the type of composite where mechanical alloying may provide an inexpensive processing route. Intermetallic systems to be discussed include Ni3Al, NiAl, Ti3Al, TiAl, and MoSi2. Early work on oxide dispersions in intermetallics by mechanical alloying, dispersions introduced by cryomilling, and nanocrystalline intermetallic composites will be covered by this review. The possibility of superplastic forming of nanocrystalline intermetallic matrix composites will also be considered.

SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURED SiC/Si3N4 COMPOSITE POWDERS THROUGH REACTION MILLING:</B> Z.-G. Yang, L. Shaw, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269
<P>
In this study, synthesis of SiC/Si3N4 nanocomposite powders through reaction milling was investigated. Graphite and silicon powders were used as the source of carbon and silicon respectively, while the source of nitrogen was from either nitrogen or ammonia gases. Various compositions of the starting powder mixtures for forming nanopowders spanning from pure SiC to pure Si3N4 were investigated. It was found that nanocrystalline SiC powders could be synthesized at ambient temperature by milling silicon and graphite powders in argon atmosphere. However, the formation of SiC was retarded when milling was conducted in nitrogen or ammonia atmosphere. Crystalline Si3N4 formed only after post annealing the milled powder mixtures and the annealing temperature had a strong effect on the formation of the composite powders. Based on the results from XRD, TEM, DTA and TGA, the formation mechanisms of the composite powders will be discussed.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE VACUUM HOT PRESSING BEHAVIOR OF SILICON CARBIDE FIBERS COATED WITH NANOCRYSTALLINE Ti-6Al-4V:</B> Joseph M.

Wadley, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
The vacuum hot pressing of silicon carbide monofilaments coated with nanocrystalline Ti-6A1-4V has been studied and modeled. In the experiments, surprisingly high identification rates were observed, even at processing temperatures and pressures well below those used for processing conventional Ti-6A1-4V. From the cross sections of partially consolidated specimen, the evolution of coated fiber-fiber contacts and pore shapes were determined. The pores were found to be cusp-shaped throughout the consolidation process. Columns of coated fibers were observed to form which resulted in regions of locally high fiber volume fraction. In the model, the initial densification was based upon a micromechanical contact analysis for a metal coated fiber. Final stage densification was analyzed by modifying the Qian et al strain rate potential for a power law creeping body containing isolated cusp-shaped pores. Simulations of the VHP experiments were performed using this model which incorporated time and temperature dependent microstructure relations. Overall, the simulations compared well with the experimental density data, although the load supported by the regions of locally high fiber volume fraction resulted in the model slightly overestimating the observed densification time response.

<P>
The metallization of structural ceramic fibers by physical vapor deposition, sputtering, etc., followed by consolidation (e.g. hot isostatic pressing) offers an attractive route for the manufacture of continuous fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC's). Recent models for describing the evolution of key microstructural features (such as porosity, interfacial reaction zone thickness and fiber microbending/fracture) during consolidation are described, and are combined to simulate changes in the composite's microstructural &quot;state&quot; during arbitrary consolidation process schedules. Results are presented for PVD Ti-6Al-4V -coated SiC monofilament fibers consolidated by vacuum hot pressing which illustrate the presence of optimal solutions to the process path planning problem. An optimization scheme is briefly described which allows identification of the consolidation process cycle providing maximum relative density with minimum fiber and interfacial damage. In addition to the process schedule, optimal quality is shown to depend strongly on the fiber/matrix combination, the initial coated fiber packing geometry and the (evolving) matrix microstructural state.

MODEL-BASED SIMULATION OF THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESSING:</B> R.Vancheeswaran, <I>H. N. G. Wadley</I>, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
The performance of fiber reinforced titanium matrix composites (TMC) made by consolidation of spray deposited monotapes is strongly influenced by the processing conditions used. This high temperature consolidation step must simultaneously minimize fiber microbending/fracture, the interfacial reaction product layers at the fiber-matrix interface and at the same time eliminate matrix voids (i.e. increase the relative density). These three microstructural variables have conflicting dependencies upon the consolidation process variables (temperature, pressure and time), and it has been difficult to identify process pathways by trial and error that lead to composites of acceptable quality (where the fiber damage and reaction layer thickness are kept below some bounds, while matrix porosity is eliminated). Models for predicting the microstructure's dependence upon process conditions (i.e. the time varying temperature and pressure) are combined with consolidation equipment dynamics to simulate the microstructure evolution and to assess the relative &quot;processability&quot; of several silicon carbide fiber/titanium alloy matrix systems during their consolidation. We introduce the idea of process failure surfaces and show how this simulation tool in conjunction with a model predictive control (algorithm), is able to design &quot;locally&quot; optimal process cycles that minimize fiber damage, reaction product layer thickness and porosity. The approach is then used to path plan process schedules that will steer away from these damage surfaces for a variety of TMC systems.

STUDIES ON SINTERED ZIRCON-REINFORCED ALUMINUM ALLOY MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> J. U.

G. Reddy, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487
<P>
Zircon, ZrSiO4, is a thermally stable mineral. Owing to its abundance, high hardness, excellent abrasion/wear resistance and low coefficient of thermal expansion, researchers are investigating its use for medium strength, tribological applications. In the present study, the conventional low-cost, double compaction powder metallurgy route in the synthesis of Al-13.5Si-2.5 Mg alloy(wt%) reinforced with ZrSiO4, was investigated. The mechanical, physical and tribological properties were determined following the development of optimum conditions of compaction and sintering. At 0.15Vf, the UTS, 0.2%Y.S. and hardness improved by 4%, 12.8% and 88% respectively while the adhesive wear rate and the coefficient of friction reduced by 99.55 and 35.5% respectively. At a critical volume fraction of zircon, between 0.03 and 0.05, a significant improvement in wear resistance was observed. The use of optical microscopy, EPMA, SEM and x-ray analysis revealed the phases and possible reactions at the matrix-reinforcement interface, fracture mode and compositions of fractured surfaces which are related to measured mechanical properties and, the influence of the reinforcement phase on wear rate. Further structural analysis showed that the improvement in mechanical properties is attributed largely to the load-bearing ability and intrinsic hardness of zircon than to particulate dispersion effects. An attempt was made to model the strength of the composites.

SYNTHESIS OF IN-SITU TiAl-BASED COMPOSITES FROM ELEMENTAL POWDERS:</B> D.E. Alman, J.A. Hawk, U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, Albany, Oregon 97321<P>
Alloys and composites based on the intermetallic compound TiAl are emerging as an important class of light-weight, high-temperature structural materials. Recently, it has been recognized that these alloys have applications in industries, such as the automotive industry, where cost is frequently a major concern in materials selection. However, for these alloys to be used in this type of application, new low cost methods for high volume component fabrication are required. One potential fabrication approach is reactive synthesis (also termed combustion synthesis). This technique involves initiating an self-propagating, high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction within an intimate mixture of elemental powders. This process has been used to fabricate intermetallics, ceramics and in-situ composites in the form of powders and dense monoliths. SHS reactions tend to initiate at low homologous temperatures of the forming compound (for aluminides near or at the melting point of Al, 660&#176;C), and tend to go to completion in a short period of time (i.e., a few seconds). For some compounds, particularly aluminides, the reaction is ac companied by the formation of transient liquid phases. These factors can reduce the required processing parameters (time, temperature and pressure) needed to produce dense products by reactive synthesis techniques compared to conventional powder metallurgical approaches. This paper characterizes the reactions that occur and resultant microstructures of TiAl based composites fabricated from ternary mixtures of elemental Ti, Al and B or Si powders. Mixtures of the elemental powders were prepared corresponding to TiAl reinforced with 0, 10 25, 60 and 100 vol. pct. Ti5Si3 or TiB2. The powders were consolidated by reactive hot-pressing (at 1000&#176;C and 20 MPa for 1 hr). It was found that the composites produced from Ti, Al and Si powders were dense, and the elemental powders transformed to the target phases of TiAl and Ti5Si3. Whereas, composites produced from the Ti, Al and B powders were porous and inhomogeneous, that is several aluminide (TiAl, Ti3Al and TiAl3) and boride phases (TiB2, AlB12, TiB) formed during hot-pressing. The different behavior observed by the two ternary systems can be attributed to both reaction sequence and phase diagram considerations. First, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) revealed that an endothermic reaction associated with the formation of Al-Si eutectic occurs prior to the initiation of an SHS reaction within the mixtures of Ti, Al and Si powders. No such pre-reaction melting occurred within the mixtures of Ti, Al, and B powders. Thus, the &quot;extra&quot; transient liquid phase that formed during the reaction between Ti, Al and Si systems enhances diffusion (hence homogenization) and densification within this system during reaction processing. Also, an examination of phase diagrams reveals that there exists no Al-Si compounds to compete with the formation of titanium-aluminide and titanium-silicides during reactions between Ti, Al and Si powders. However, there are several aluminum-boride phases that can compete with the formation of titanium-aluminide and titanium-boride during reactions between Ti, Al and B powders. The implications of this study is that TiAl-based composites can be designed for densification during reactive processing.

REACTIVE SYNTHESIS OF NiAl-Nb COMPOSITE FROM ELEMENTAL POWDERS:</B> L. Farber, A. Lawley, I. Gotman, Department of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104; I. Gotman, E. Y. Gutmanas, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel<P>
A NiAl matrix composite reinforced with Nb particles was synthesized in the solid state from blends of ultrafine elemental Ni, Al and Nb powders. The fabrication method involved consolidation of elemental powder blends to full density followed by heat treatment. The maximum processing temperature did not exceed 800&#176;C. Kinetics and the sequence of phases formation during synthesis were investigated. For Ni-Al-Nb blends, consumption of Al with the formation of Ni-Al intermetallic phases only was detected in the temperature range 425&#176;C-550&#176;C. Subsequent heat treatment at 800&#176;C resulted in rapid completion of the synthesis reaction with the formation of the NiAl matrix. No reaction occurred between Nb particles and the matrix during synthesis. The phase stability of the composite in the 800&#176;C-1100&#176;C temperature range was investigated. Mechanical properties of the synthesized material are discussed in the context of resulting microstructure.

FeAl-TiC AND FeAl-WC COMPOSITES - MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES:</B> <I>R. Subramanian,,</I> J.H. Schneibel, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6115<P>
For applications of TiC- and WC-based cermets in corrosive environments, a potential binder material is an intermetallic, iron aluminide. In this investigation, it is shown that iron aluminide (Fe-40 at %Al) bonded TiC and WC composites can be processed to almost full density (&gt; 99%) with carbide volume fractions ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 by conventional liquid phase sintering and pressureless melt infiltration techniques. The melt infiltration process was successful in the fabrication of composites with carbide volume fractions greater than 0.7 and important aspects of this technique will be discussed. Mechanical property data such as bend strength, hardness and fracture toughness will be presented and interpreted in terms of the composite microstructures. For FeAl-WC composites containing 60 vol.% WC, room temperature three-point bend strengths and fracture toughness values reached 1680 MPa and 20 MPa.m1/2, respectively. Consistent with the high fracture toughnesses, the fracture surfaces showed evidence of ductile deformation of the FeAl binder.

DEOXYGEN IN SILICIDE FORMATION:</B> Chi-Fung Lo, Darryl Draper, Materials Research Corporation, Orangeburg, NY 10962<P>
A preliminary study on the deoxygen behavior of tungsten-, molybdenum- and tantalum-silicide formations using powder technique was performed. During the synthesis under vacuum, the transformation of amorphous to crystalline silicon and the formation of silicides were monitored by X-ray diffraction. The oxygen content in the materials at various phase-transformation stages was measured. The results indicated that, independent of the synthesized metals, no significant change in the oxygen content was found until the formation of metal-disilicides. Via the formation of disilicides, the oxygen decreased from 1000-3000 ppm to less than 500 ppm. In this study, the exothermic behavior of silicon phase transformation and the silicide formations was also investigated.

TITANIUM/TITANIUM CARBIDE COMPOSITE FORMATION BY GAS-SOLID IN-SITU REACTION:</B> Yong Jin Kim, <I>Hyungsik Chung</I>, Department of Materials Processing, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, 66 Sangnam Dong, Changwon, Kyungnam 641-010, S-Korea; Suk-Joong L. Kang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1 Kusong-Dong, Yusong-Gu, Taejon 305-701, S-Korea<P>
Sponge titanium powder was die compacted and reacted with carbonaceous (CH4) gas at the temperature range of 700-1,000&#176;C. Layered TiC film was formed uniformly on the surface of the powders in the green compact. The thickness of the TiC layer varied with the reaction temperature and time. The reacted compacts were sintered in a vacuum up to 1450&#176;C. During the sintering, the TiC layer in the power surface was broken into small fragments and the fragment changed gradually into round shaped particles with increasing the sintering temperature. The relative sintered density over 94% was obtained at the sintering temperature of 1350&#176;C for 2hrs. Ti/TiC composite containing up to 50 v/o of TiC was successfully made by the in-situ reaction and sintering. The volume of TiC in the sintered body mainly depends on the reaction temperature, time and Ti powder size. But the gas flow rate during the reaction affected little to TiC volume in the sintered composite.

PROCESS-STRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS FOR TAPE CASTING OF CONTINUOUS FIBER-REINFORCED MMC'S:</B> Shin Yu and Dana M. Elzey, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
The tape casting process offers a potentially cost-effective manufacturing route for continuos fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites. However, the ultimate performance is limited by the presence of microstructural defects, which evolve to an extent which depends sensitively on the constituent materials and processing conditions used. Results of an experimental study are reported in which the evolution of several important microstructural defects have been investigated for various processing conditions. These observations have been used as a basis for the development of predictive process-structure models for the tape casting of MMC's. The models may be used to explore processibility and cost issues for hypothetical matrix/fiber composite systems and processing conditions.

FIBER FRAGMENTATION DURING PROCESSING OF METALLIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Nicole M. Gorey</I>, Donald A. Koss, John R. Hellmann, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802<P>
Fiber fragmentation can be a serious problem during the processing of metallic matrix composites. This research focuses on the fracture of continuous sapphire fibers during composite consolidation. During the latter stages of consolidation, matrix flow along the fibers may cause fiber fracture even in the absence of fiber bending. Fiber fragmentation by this mechanism has been examined using a theoretical analysis which predicts the extent of composite flow as a function of processing parameters and the resulting fiber fragmentation lengths. In order to validate the analysis, a model composite system, which consisted of a tin matrix and degraded sapphire fibers, has been &quot;hot pressed&quot; at room temperature to simulate elevated temperature consolidation of sapphire-reinforced Ni-base composites. A comparison of observed and predicted fiber fragmentation lengths indicate good agreement. The analysis can readily be applied to predicting conditions that should be used to prevent extension-induced fiber fracture during high temperature consolidation of structural composites. The research was supported by NASA.

COMMERCIAL PROCESSING OF METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> W.C. Harrigan, Jr., Alyn Corporation, P.O. Box 16249, Irvine, CA 92623
<P>
Discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites are a class of materials that exhibit a blending of properties of the reinforcement and the matrix. The reinforcement can be ultrahigh strength whiskers, short or chopped fibers or particles. Each of the reinforcements have property or cost attributes which dictates use in a given situation. Commercial producers have concentrated on composites with particles because of cost issues. These composites have been made by a number of manufacturing techniques. These include powder metallurgy, casting and spray deposition. The technique that has consistently produced high property composites has been powder metallurgy. Recent work in this area has been on refining techniques that offer lower cost manufacturing. Scale-up of facilities to produce vacuum hot pressed composite billets has been completed with the help of DOD funds through a Defense Procurement Act Title 3 program. Several companies have been working with a CIP-Sinter process to produce lower cost billet stock. This talk will review the recent cost reduction programs and the implications of these programs on the commercialization of these composites.

SYNTHESIS AND MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF NiAl-Al2O3 FUNCTIONALLY GRADIENT COMPOSITE:</B>  D. Padmavardhani, A. Gomez, R. Abbaschian
<P>
Reactive Hot Compaction of Ni and Al powders in which one or both of the powders were preoxidized was carried out to fabricate functionally gradient composite (FGC) of NiAl with in-situ Al2O3  reinforcement. The FGC consisted of five layers with a variation of alumina content from less than 4% on one side to about 52% on the other. The gradient in the composition was obtained by stacking different powder mixtures of desired compositions. The alumina formed a continuous network around the NiAl during the compaction process. The effects of powder oxidation and heating rate on the formation of NiAl, Al3Ni and Al3Ni2 will be discussed on the basis of the DTA and microstructural studies.

POWDER METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES: SELECTION AND PROCESSING:</B> M.J. Tan and Zhang Xi, School of Mech. &amp; Prod. Eng., Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263
<P>
There has been growing interest in the last decade in the development of metal-matrix composites (MMCs) for the aerospace industries because of their attractive physical and mechanical properties, and enhanced elevated temperature capabilities. However, some of the fabrication techniques (e.g. using powder metallurgy) for this new class of MMCs are hampered by (i) the poor distribution of the reinforcements, and (ii) the limited room temperature ductility of the composites and hence formability. This presentation reports work done to address the above two problems by (i) an analysis based on size difference of matrix and reinforcement particles, taking into account the processing parameters, and (ii) introducing an innovative way of extruding brittle composites to increase its formability. By mainly considering the size difference effect of matrix powder and reinforcement particle, a critical value of reinforcement size is proposed to predict whether a uniform distribution of reinforcement is possible in powder metallurgy of particulate reinforced metal matrix composites. A uniform distribution of reinforcement could be expected only when the reinforcement size dT is not less than a critical value dC which is a function of reinforcement size dr and volume fraction Vf and reduction ratio of secondary processing, R. In extrusion, a <I>Front Pad Extrusion Method</I> was used to avoid fir-tree cracking on the surfaces of extrudates, especially the brittle metal composites. By this method, the MMCs were successfully extruded without any surface cracking, and all the extrudates were found to be covered by a thin layer of the pad material. This was illustrated using a schematic flow pattern of the extrudate and pad material in the dead metal zone during extrusion. Furthermore, decreased pressure requirements were necessary for extrusions using the front pad extrusion method.

CHARACTERIZATION OF Cu/Cu2O COMPOSITES PRODUCED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL DEPOSITION:</B> <I>F.S. Miller</I>, D.C. Van Aken, Dept. of Metallurgical Engineering, E.W. Bohannan and J.A. Switzer, Dept. of Chemistry, The University of Missouri, Rolla, MO 65409
<P>
Nanocrystalline composites of copper metal and cuprous oxide were produced at room temperature by electrodeposition from an alkaline copper lactate solution. The phase composition can be continuously changed by controlling the cathode current density. At current densities below 0.1 mA/cm2 nearly pure cuprous oxide is produced and at 2.5 mA/cm2 nearly pure copper is produced. At intermediate current densities composite structures are formed. These thin films show unique optical properties that are related to the 10 to 20 nm grain diameter of Cu2O produced by electrodeposition. During deposition of the composite material the electrode potential oscillates spontaneously at fixed current density. Microstructural information obtained by TEM indicates the formation of a metastable compound that may be related to the electrode potential oscillations. This work has been funded in part by the National Science Foundation under contract DMR-92-02872.

SPATIALLY VARIED INTERFACES AS A PROBE OF INTERFACE FAILURE MECHANISMS IN Ti-MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Benji Maruyama</I>, Wright Laboratory/NIST, 2230 10th ST STE 1, WPAFB, OH 45433; Douglas B. Gundel, Systran Co., Inc., 4126 Linden Ave., Dayton, OH 45432; Sunil Warrier, Universal Energy Systems, 4401 Dayton-Xenia Rd., Dayton, OH 45432
<P>
Spatially Varied Interfaces is a design concept for composite synthesis whereby the interface mechanical response is tailored to the composite needs by varying the interface properties in patterns of weak and strong areas. In the SiCf/Ti-alloy system, random patterns have been fabricated, along with bands, longitudinal stripes and helices. To be presented are results of transverse tensile and longitudinal fatigue crack growth experiments where selected regions of the interface are systematically strengthened or weakened, and the perturbation of the failure process is measured to gain a better understanding of the stress states and interface failure mechanisms. This work was conducted in the Metals &amp; Ceramics Division of the Materials Directorate at Wright Laboratory.

THE PROPERTIES AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF Al-BASED COMPOSITES REINFORCED WITH CERAMIC PARTICLES:</B> M. Samgorinski, S. Grenier, A. Cavasin, T. Brzezinski, G. Kim, P.G. Tsantrizos, PERMA, 1744 William, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3J 1R4
<P>
Al-based composite materials which were produced by Powder Metallurgy (PM) and Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS) are presented in this article. The objective was to produce materials with low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), tailored to approach that of steel (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approxeq-cong.gif">13x10-6 K-1), and to improve the mechanical properties of the matrix. Composite materials based on Al are used in different fields where weight and thermal stability are key requirements, such as aerospace components, electronic packaging, high precision instrumentation, and automobile engine components. The nature, size and the relative quantities of the different reinforcing phases were considered in calculations involving the optimization of the main characteristics of the composites. Fine dispersed powders (5-20 &#181;m) of Si3N4, AlN, TiB2, Al2O3, 2Al2O3&#183;2SiO2, B4C and SiC were used as the strengthening phases, while pure Al, 6061 and Al-Si alloy were used as the matrix. The dimensional and relaxation stability were investigated for several composites. The influence of plastic deformation and heat treatment on the structure and properties of VPS deposited composites were also investigated. It was found that a combination of plastic deformation and heat treatment (annealing or quenching with aging) increased the mechanical properties, on average, by a factor of 1.5 to 2.

EFFECT OF MICROSTRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENT ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Ni/a-Al2O3 METAL-CERAMIC COMPOSITES:</B> <I>E.D. Rodeghiero, </I>E.P. Giannelis, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-1501
<P>
The degree to which a ductile metallic phase can be used to toughen brittle ceramic materials is highly dependent on the microstructural dispersion of the metallic constituent, the metal's aspect ratio and characteristic size, and the amount of constraint imposed on the metal by the ceramic matrix. This talk will focus on the effect of these parameters on the mechanical properties, and in particular the fracture toughness, of Ni/a-Al2O3 composites prepared through both in-situ and conventional approaches. The composites discussed will vary from particulate toughened cermets prepared from chemical and/or powder approaches to complex, anisotropic materials containing Ni foils or fibers. Through evaluation of the experimental evidence and theoretical models, the optimum microstructural arrangement of the Ni phase in the a-Al2O3 matrix will be presented.

FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF SILICON CARBIDE PARTICULATE REINFORCED ALUMINUM ALLOY COMPOSITES:</B> A.B.

<P>
This study is part of an overall effort to optimize the strength toughness combination in discontinuously reinforced aluminum (DRA) composites for application in aerospace structures. Two different matrix alloys were considered, namely Al-2009 and Al-7091, to represent intermediate and high strength matrices, respectively, and they were reinforced with SiC particles of 4.9 and 10.4 mm. The powders were consolidated directly via blind-die extrusion, thus reducing processing time significantly from conventional vacuum hot pressing techniques. Fracture toughness tests were performed with precracked bend bars, and the J-resistance curves were determined. Damage modes were evaluated in both tensile and fracture toughness samples, in an attempt to understand the factors that may provide intrinsic toughness improvement without significant loss of strength. The mechanical properties and damage modes were compared with control samples of unreinforced materials fabricated using an identical processing route as the composites. Data from these control materials provided an added insight that has often lacked in past fracture toughness studies. This work was performed at Materials Directorate Wright Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.

REDUCTION OF THE MOISTURE CONTENT IN MRN BAUXITE, BY TREATMENT WITH DEWATERING AID:</B> <I>Carlos Estevam da Silva</I>, Marcos Fernando Dias Moreira, Minerac&atilde;o Rio do Norte S.A. , Porto Trombetas, PA 68275-000 Brazil; Luis Gustavo Esteves Pereira, Mauro Pinto dos Reis, Nalco Brasil Ltda, Av. das Nac&otilde;es Unidas, 17891 - 11o. Andar, Sao Paulo, - SP - 04795-100 - Brazil<P>
MRN must sell their bauxite at a maximum of 12% moisture content to avoid paying a penalty. To meet this target it is necessary to mix dried and wet bauxite; however, that mixing is very costly because of the high drying cost. Thus MRN and NALCO BRASH have worked together to develop a chemical program to reduce the moisture content of wet bauxite. A large number of dewatering aid products were tested on a lab scale. Two products were selected and tried in pilot plant scale. Finally the product 95DW121 was selected and tried on an industrial scale. The industrial trial was run for three months in the fine and superfine plants with the results that the bauxite moisture was reduced around three percentage points with a dosage rate of 80 g/t.

BQUANT: COST-EFFECTIVE CALCULATIONS OF BAUXITE MINERALOGY:</B> <I> Frank M. Kimmerle</I>, Frank Feret, Alcan International Ltd., Arvida Research and Development Centre, P. O. Box 1250, Jonqui&egrave;re, QC, G7S-4K8; Barbara Feret, BF Simulation, 3099 St. Patrick St., Jonqui&egrave;re<P>
Routine elemental analysis of the major and minor oxides in alumina-bearing minerals, using modern XRF instrumentation yields better than 0.1% reproducibility at a rate exceeding 100 samples per day. However, the mineralogy required to evaluate the amount of recoverable alumina or other Bayer plant parameters has been far less readily accessible. Empirical fits between elemental composition and simulated plant digests are limited to narrow composition ranges in particular geological deposits. Interpretation of X-ray diffractograms is notoriously slow, influenced by crystallite size, amorphous phases, and preferred orientation effects. Instead, using non-linear programming, the BQUANT software provides quantitative phase analysis based on an elemental mass balance. It can even deal with overburden, clay bottoms and is independent of the exact nature of the geological deposit. Given its rapidity, it is particularly useful for estimating the potential of new deposits. Given its accuracy, it greatly facilitates mine exploitation control.

MONITORING OF HEAT EXCHANGER PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE SCALING FACTOR:</B> <I>Eug&egrave;nio C. G. Azevedo Jr</I>., Carlos Eduardo A. Batista, Alumar-Cons&oacute;rcio de Alum&iacute;nio, BR 135 - Km 18, Distrito Industrial de Pedrinhas CEP 65095.050 - S&atilde;o Luis/MA - Brasil<P>
The ALUMAR Refinery was designed to maximize heat recovery, and therefore minimize process steam requirements. Since the increase of alumina production from 0.5 to 1.2 million tons per year, the heat exchangers became a strategic point in the refinery performance. An objective has been to create a tool to improve the performance of the heaters. A continuous method of monitoring individual heaters was developed of calculating the scaling factor using the principles of the heat transfer theory. This paper describes the method and the steps to achieve a significant improvement in the identification and troubleshooting of heat transfer related problems. This method also proved to have a positive effect on the operation and maintenance planning of the heat exchangers in the refining.

THE PRECIPITATION MECHANISM OF SODIUM ALUMINOSILICATE SCALE IN BAYER PLANTS:</B> <I>J. Addai-Mensah</I>, A.R. Gerson, K. Zheng, A. O'dea, R. St. C. Smart, Ian Wark Research Institute, University of South Australia, The Levels, Adelaide, 5095, Australia<P>
During the dissolution of bauxite ores by caustic soda, a serious and unwanted downstream precipitation of sodium aluminosilicate may occur in heat exchangers, due to the presence of silica impurity dissolved in the Bayer liquor. To date, the mechanism of nucleation and growth of scale occurring on heat transfer surfaces is not fully known. This paper presents the results from studies carried out to investigate the mechanism of formation of sodium aluminosilicate scale on metallic surfaces under conditions close to those in alumina refineries. It is shown that the scale formation may involve two aluminosilicate dimorphs: sodalite and cancrinite. The extent of solution desilication and scale growth was observed to be strongly temperature and carbonate impurity concentration dependent.

ASPECT OF DEEP DESILICATION WITH LIME AGENT:</B> <I>Qingwei Wang</I>, Gengyou Tian Zhengzhou, Light Metals Research Institute, Shangjie District, Zhengzhou City, Henan, 450041, China; Chongyu Yang, Central South University of Technology, Changsha City, Hunan, 410083, China<P>
The formation of hydrogarnet (CAS) with low solubility is the essence of desilication of the sodium aluminate solutions with lime addition. The mechanisms of formation of hydrogarnet were studied. It is indicated that desilication with formation CAS is in a form of SCM-type model, i.e. the unreacted core model for spherical particles of unchanging size. The reaction is controlled by diffusion through outer layer. A mathematical model of the kinetics of the process has been developed.

A STUDY OF DESILICATION OF ALUMINATE SOLUTION WITH HCAC</B> <I>: Peng Zhihong</I>, Li Xiaobin, Department of Metallurgy, Central South University of Technology, Changsha, Hunan, 410083, China<P>
Because the sintering process is very important in the Chinese alumina industry, it is important to understand and improve on desilication of aluminate solutions from the sintering process. This paper presents a thorough study on a new method of desilication utilizing HCAC (4CaO&#183;Al2O3&#183;mCO2&#183;mH2O) both in theory and practice. The reaction thermodynamics and kinetics study reveal the reaction laws during synthesis of HCAC and desilication with HCAC. All levels of tests and applications indicate that the desilication effect of HCAC is superior to lime. It can achieve lower silica concentrations in the purified solution under the same amount of lime addition. At the same target silica concentration it can decrease the amount of lime addition about 44% and reduce the loss of alumina about 30%. The new method has achieved satisfactory results in the plant after replacing the old method of desilication with lime in Shangdong Aluminium Corporation. It sets a new path for sintering processes in China by improving alumina product quality, decreasing energy consumption, and raising the target of technology and economy.

LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES FOR TREATMENT OF BAYER PROCESS LAKE WATER:</B> <I>A.J. Perrotta</I>, Alcoa Technical Center, Alcoa Center, PA 15069-0001, F.S. Williams, Alcoa Alumina &amp; Chemicals, L.L.C., Point Comfort, TX 77978-0101, L. Stonehouse, Alcoa of Australia, Kwinana R &amp; D, Western Australia
<P>
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or the so-called anionic clays are the analog of the extensively studied family of cationic smectite clay minerals. The successful treatment of Bayer lake waters requires the removal of anions, both inorganic and organic; thus, the utilization of these anionic clays are ideally suited for this process. Insitu crystallization of layered double hydroxides have resulted in the removal of anions from Bayer lake water at two different refineries. Data on the removal of anions and their selectivity for intercalation in the layered double hydroxide indicates that the order of removal is CO3, C2O4, SO4. The monovalent chloride ion is least preferred but also can be extracted at significant levels at the higher level of treatment. The total organic carbon (TOC) is also lowered significantly. Measurements on succinate and malonate, both diacids, show a significant reduction at the higher levels of treatment. Successful regeneration of hydrocalumite show the thermal products of mayenite and calcium oxide which can then be recrystallized in lake water with concomitant further reduction in anion content. Additional experiments using ultrasonic radiation show an enhanced carbonate removal through increased calcite formation.

TECHNICAL PECULIARITIES AND VIABILITY OF HYDROTHERMAL TREATMENT OF RED MUD:</B> <I>K&aacute;roly Solym&aacute;r</I>, Janos Steiner, J&oacute;zsef Z&otilde;ldi, ALTAK Consulting Ltd. H-1125 Budapest, Zsolna u.31-33. Hungary
<P>
The regeneration of the chemically bound caustic soda and alumina from red mud was studied in laboratory and pilot plant scale between 260 and 320&#176;C as a function of caustic soda concentration and final A/C ratio of the liquor, lime dosage and retention time. The pilot plant tests have been carried out in a tube digester facility of 3.0 m3/h designed by HUNGALU ALUTERV-FKI Ltd. and the test work was performed in cooperation with the team from the Alm&aacute;sfuzit&oacute; Alumina Refinery. At 260-320&#176;C iron-rich iron-aluminium-hydrogarnets (Ca-Al-Fe-hydrosilicates) were formed allowing 90-95% Na2O and 20-70% Al2O3 content of red mud to be recovered as a function of the final A/C ratio with a specific lime consumption of 2.5-3.0 kg CaO/kg regenerated NaOH. The tube digester was found as an adequate equipment. The viability of the process highly depends on the price ratio of the caustic soda and burnt lime. The latest development in red mud separation also increased the viability of the hydrothermal treatment of red mud.

EXPLOITING THE RHEOLOGY OF BAUXITE RESIDUE IN TAILINGS DISPOSAL STRATEGIES:</B> <I>N. Pashias</I>, D.V. Boger, Advanced Mineral Products Research Center and Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia
<P>
This paper demonstrates how an understanding of the complex rheological properties of bauxite residue suspensions can be exploited in the implementation of a dry disposal strategy. Comparative data are presented for bauxite residue generated from three refineries in Australia and from refineries in Jamaica, Suriname, and Brazil. The necessary properties for optimum handling of the residue at high concentrations and for dry stacking and/or slope deposition are established.

MOBILITY ON MUD:</B> <I>Danys Morin,</I> Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;lectrolyse et de Chimie Alcan Lt&eacute;e, Vaudreuil Works, Jonqui&eacute;re, Qu&eacute;bec
<P>
The Vaudreuil Alumina plants use deep thickeners to prepare their red mud for disposal in a 60 ft. high wet stack. Management of this stack requires four-seasons access to the pipework and occasional dust suppression procedures. From peak to foothills the stack can display all the phases of fluidity present in the mud. Vaudreuil has developed a family of vehicles to provide the required access from a 25 tonne amphibian to spread gypsum on the mud to control dusting, to a 1.5 tonne tractor-trailer for personnel transport. This paper describes the units in detail and explains how the characteristics of the mud can be used to give a good load-bearing capacity.

OPTIMIZATION OF GRINDING OF ALUMINAS IN THE ROTARY-VIBRATION MILL AND THEIR EFFECT ON PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MOULDERS:</B><I> Mariusz A. Wojcik</I>, Tomasz Gajda, University of Mining and Metallurgy, Faculty of Materials Science and Ceramics, av. Mickiewicza 30,A-3, 30-059 Cracow, Poland; Ansgar Luttermann, Fachhochschule Munster, Fachbereich Chemieingenieurwesen Stegerwaldstrasse 39,d-48565 Steinfurt, Germany
<P>
The properties of high alumina ceramics are strongly influenced by the properties of the starting raw materials such as the grain size distribution and their morphology. Due to this, the grinding operation is an important step in the process of ceramic mass production. The investigations presented show that compared to other mills, the use of a rotary vibration mill will reduce time of grinding, the energy consumption and yield finer powders. The aim of these investigations was to obtain alumina powders with d50 approximately 3 um and d90 close to 10 um. Two different starting materials were tested. The process of grinding was performed according to various parameters such as filling ratio, amount of grinding media, alumina and water, ball set and frequency. The influence of ratios between the grinding media, alumina and water are shown. The influence of ball size, time and frequencies on the kinetics of grinding are shown. Finally the effect of alumina grinding on the physical properties such as green and fired density and shrinkage are shown and discussed in this paper.

RESULTS OF TESTS OF THE FINE GRINDING OF ALUMINA IN THE ROTARY-VIBRATION MILL WITH LOW FREQUENCY OF VIBRATION:</B> Jan Sidor<I>, Mariusz A. Wojcik</I>, University of Mining and Metallurgy, Faculty of Materials Science and Ceramics, av. Micklewicza 30, a-3, 30-059 Cracow, Poland
<P>
Results of the investigations of the fine grinding of alumina (below 0.5-2&#181;m) were presented in this paper. Tests were carried out in the laboratory rotary-vibration mill with a low frequency of vibration below 16 Hz at two sets of work. In the first set, the mill chamber had both rotary and vibration movements, while in the second one, the mill chamber made only the vibration movement such as in the case of a classic vibration mill. Results show that it is possible to obtain a high purity alumina with low energy consumption in both sets.

OPTIMIZATION OF ALUMINA PLANT OPERATION WITH RESPECT TO MARKET CONDITION:</B> <I>P. Das</I>, National Aluminium Company Ltd., Damanjodi, Dist. Koraput, Orissa 763008, India
<P>
In international markets, wide fluctuations of alumina prices have been found to be a common phenomenon over the years. It has been observed that almost all the buoyant cycles have essentially been followed by recessionary market conditions. Hence, during the periods when alumina prices are relatively low, for survival it becomes obligatory on the part of the management to strike an operational philosophy suitable for achieving minimum cost of production. However, during buoyant market conditions it is wise to make attempts for maximization of production by suitable optimization of process parameters even if there is a marginal increase in unit cost of production. Since such attempts are directly related to the profitability of the organization, a careful study should be made taking into consideration all interrelated factors. This paper highlights the areas of an alumina plant where changes in process parameters, permissible on technoeconomic consideration, could be made for optimization of production and profitability.

DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE FOR BAYER PROCESS ALUMINA PLANTS:</B> <I>C. Misra</I>, V. Soi, Alumina Technology Associates, 714 Pine Valley Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15239
<P>
PC based software packages have been developed to assist in the operation and management of Bayer process alumina plants. Software packages for digestion, residue washing and precipitation areas have been designed for use by plant operators to formulate operating policy and are integrated with existing or new process control systems. As example, important features and structure of software developed for the precipitation system are discussed in more detail.

<P>
Process engineers at Alcoa's Point Comfort refinery are using a dynamic model of the Bayer precipitation area to evaluate options in operating strategies. The dynamic simulator, a joint development effort between Point Comfort and Alcoa Technical Center, predicts process yield, particle size distributions, and occluded soda for a given flowsheet of the precipitation and classification circuit. In addition to rigorous material and particle population balances, the model includes mechanistic kinetic expressions for particle growth, agglomeration, nucleation, and attrition. The kinetic parameters have been tuned to Point Comfort's data with excellent matches between the model results and plant data. The model is written for the ACSL package with specially developed input/output graphical user interfaces which provide a user-friendly tool. Features such as a seed charge controller enhance the model's usefulness for evaluating operating conditions and process control approaches.

INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF SEED USED FOR PRECIPITATION OF THE SODIUM-ALUMINATE LIQUOR:</B> <I>Bi Shiwen</I>, Yang Yihong, Fu Gaofeng, Wen Jie, Ju Aihua, Department of Nonferrous Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110006, China
<P>
The activity of seed is one of the most important factors in the precipitation of the sodium-aluminate liquor. The industrial aluminumoxide-hydrate is treated with sulfuric acid to increase its activity, and then it is used as the seed of precipitation. It is demonstrated that the seed has the ability to increase the rate of precipitation. The reason of this phenomenon is analyzed.

SECONDARY NUCLEATION OF ALUMINUM TRIHYDROXIDE IN BAYER SODIUM ALUMINATE SOLUTION:</B> Xue Hong, <I>Bi Shiwen</I>, Shuai Shiwu, Yan Yihong, Li Dianfeng, Department of Nonferrous Metallurgy, Northeastern University, China; Chen Wankun, The Great Wall Aluminum Company of China
<P>
In this paper, secondary nucleation of aluminum trihydroxide in Bayer sodium aluminate solution was discussed by picture analysis and scanning electron micrograph. The effects of temperature, seed size and aluminate concentration on secondary nucleation are determined with growth time. As this study has shown, the nucleation rate depends upon the experimental conditions of supersaturation, temperature and seed size or surface area. The nucleation can promote the formation of relatively large particles under an opportune condition.

<P>
The physico-chemical properties of Bayerite, which was obtained in semi-commercial scale using new technology, were investigated in detail. The properties of another polymorphic form of aluminum trihydroxide, i.e., hydrargillite (Gibbsite) obtained by means of Bayer's and Grzymek's methods were also evaluated in a similar way. The results thus obtained allow characterization of the properties of hydroxides. They also put a new light on their formation and polymorphism.

FCB RETROFITTING OF ALUMINA ROTARY KILN: WHEN DRASTIC FUEL SAVING MEETS INCREASED CAPACITY:</B> <I>Vincent Giroud</I>, Andre' Pinoncely, FCB- subsidiary of the Fives Lille Group, Mineral Processing and Carbon Plant Division, 32, rue fleury Neuvesel, BP 24-69702 Givors Cedex.<P>
Alumina calcination using rotary kilns is an expensive operation. In 1972 an innovative concept of kiln retrofitting was introduced which greatly enhanced the overall thermal efficiency while preserving most of the existing capital equipment. As a result, nine kilns have been retrofitted over the last eighteen years, gradually highlighting the wide range of possible arrangements and the relevant strong process and mechanical reliability. This paper draws up the main features of these retrofits, namely the substantial energy saving and the correlative increased capacity. Long-term observations also demonstrated that alumina quality remains as consistent as previously with no significant impact on the calcined alumina size distribution. The latest retrofitting pattern including new cyclones and ducting arrangements are presented yielding a fresh look for a still useful technology.

ALUMINA CALCINATION WITH THE MULTI-PURPOSE CALCINER:</B> Jorgen Ilkjaer, Lars Bastue and <I>Benny E. Raahauge</I>, FLS Minerals A/S, Alumina &amp; Bauxite Technology, Vigerslev All&eacute; 77, DK-2500 Valby Copenhagen, Denmark<P>
The Gas Suspension Calciner (GSC) and the rotary kiln are both well proven technologies for calcination of alumina. The GSC is mainly used for production of smelter grade alumina and the rotary kiln for special grade alumina. A multi-purpose calciner which combines these two technologies has been designed, constructed and commissioned in the summer of 1996. By combining these two calcination technologies it is possible to produce a wide range of alumina qualities only by changing a few parameters in the operation using a Fuzzy II Logic Control System and a CemScanner.

PREDICTING MOISTURE CONTENT ON ALUMINAS FROM MEASUREMENT OF WATER ISOTHERMS:</B> <I>A.R. Gillespie, </I>Comalco Research Centre, Thomastown, Vic., Australia; M.M. Hyland, J.B. Metson, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand<P>
Water adsorption isotherms on alumina can play an important predictive role in aluminium smelting since the level of moisture on the alumina influences its handling, feeding and dissolution characteristics, along with the potential for generation of emissions. Measurements of adsorption isotherms of water on smelter aluminas indicate moisture pick-up and loss is rapid, with initial rates of change in adsorbed water in excess of 0.1 wt% per minute, meaning the <I>ex-situ</I> measurements are not likely to be accurate. Adsorption and desorption curves, to water pressures in excess of 20 Torr, indicate near complete reversibility. The discrepancy is attributed to the irreversible formation of Al(OH)3. Analysis of the shape of the curves suggest several distinct mechanistic regimes within the adsorption curve.

A laboratory method for comparing characteristics of alumina dissolution in molten cryolite is described. The method uses fast modified linear sweep voltammetry combined with thermal analysis to determine the dissolution rate of alumina in a molten cryolite electrolyte. Practical aspects of the method are discussed. Emphasis is on consistent alumina feeding and stirring and a careful monitoring of the alumina moisture content.

SINTERING AND HEAT CONDUCTIVITY OF ALUMINA:</B> <I>Terje &Oslash;stvold</I>, &Oslash;yvind T.

<P>
Heat conductivities are measured in alumina powders treated with 0-7 wt% NaAlF4 at varying temperatures up to 900&#176;C. The <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> transition of alumina, triggered by addition of NaAlF4, was found to be essential for the observed increase in heat conductivity. A maximum heat conductivity was measured at 3.5 wt% NaAlF4 for aluminas heated to 700&#176;C and at ~2 wt% NaAlF4 for heat treatments at 800 and 900&#176;C. The heat conductivity was also measured versus temperature after the samples had been sintered. A decrease in heat conductivity with increasing sample temperature was observed. A mathematical model for the thermal conductivity of porous materials was applied and tested against the measured data, confirming the importance of sintering with respect to thermal conductivity. The relevance of the present findings concerning heat balance of industrial smelting cells is discussed.

RECOVERING ALUMINA, SILICA AND BYPRODUCTS FROM COAL ASH THROUGH THE USE OF PROCESS FOR SILICON PRE-EXTRACTION:</B> <I>Victor L. Rayzman</I>, 933 Regal Road, Encinitas, CA 92024; Solomon A. Shcherban, 110 Bennet Avenue, #3H, New York, N.Y. 10033<P>
The large volume of coal combustion wastes cause a problem of great concern in environmental protection. Only about a quarter of these wastes are being used today, generally for construction materials production. At the same time, many million tons of aluminum and silicon contained in coal ash are lost in landfills annually. Of all the large number of processes for recovering alumina and byproducts from aluminum and silicon-bearing wastes only one, the lime-soda sintering process, has been commercially used on nepheline residue and red mud. To approach ash composition similar to these above-mentioned wastes, a process for silicon pre-extraction has been developed and pilot plant tested. The method reduces the material stream trough the sintering kiln in half and produces high pure silica alongside the alumina and calcium silicate. The heat consumption for the new process is estimated significantly lower than that for the sintering method and approaches the Bayer technology indices.

FEATURES OF ALUMINA PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY FROM ALUMINOSILICATE RAW MATERIAL WITH POTASSIUM'S HIGH CONTAIN:</B> <I>V.A. Lipin</I>, N. N. Tikhonov Russian National Aluminium-Magnesium Institute (VAMI), 88, Sredny pr., St. Petersburg, 199026, Russia<P>
Aluminosilicate raw materials have large differences in chemical and mineralogical structure, particularly in the relationship between sodium and potassium. Large deposits of raw materials with high portions of potassium alkalis are known and have been studied for the purpose of the industrial processing by the sintering and hydrometallurgical methods. Technological features of the processing of the high-potassium aluminosilicate raw materials utilize for the most part the processes of sintering, leaching and desilication. The optimum molecular ratios of the main components before sintering were found in each case. Distribution of alkaline metals between liquid and solid phases during leaching and desilicating was determined. Utilizing experimental data, equations have been developed predicting the dependence of desilicating indexes from chemical composition of processing ores. These relationships aid in choosing the most effective conditions for research of promising raw materials.

<P>CELL HOODING EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENTS FOR HS S&Oslash;DERBERG CELLS:</B> <I>Alton T. Tabereaux,</I> Jim Brown, Ivan Eldridge, Reynolds Metals Company, Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, 3326 East 2nd Street, Muscle Shoals, AL 35661
<P>
A method has been developed for measuring the gas capture efficiency of volatile gas emissions for the cell hooding system of HS S&oslash;derberg cells. No prior method for measuring the gas capture efficiency for HS S&oslash;derberg cells has been reported to date. This paper presents the newly developed procedures, techniques and results measured during plant tests for the gas capture efficiency of 92 kA HS S&oslash;derberg cells equipped with an improved cell hooding system to reduce plant emissions. The dependency of the gas capture efficiency upon the duct exhaust velocity was determined for the HS 
S&oslash;derberg cells using this method.

<P>COS, CS2 AND SO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRE-BAKED HALL HEROULT CELLS</B>: <I>Frank M. Kimmerle</I>, Luc No&euml;l, Alcan International Ltd., Arvida Research and Development Centre, P.O. Box 1250, Jonquiere, QC, G7S-4K8, Canada; John T. Pisano, Unisearch Ass. Inc., 222 Snidercroft Rd., Concord, ONT, L4K 1B5, Canada
<P>
Measurements of CO2, CO, COS and CS2 emissions in collected gas samples by GC-MS and of SO2 by ion chromatography of scrubber solutions allowed us to complete a carbon and sulphur mass balance for P155 pre-bake electrolysis cells. COS and CS2 emissions were confirmed by continuous analysis using tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry of the flue cases from 64 cells over a two day period. While the volume mixing ratios of COS and CS2 of the flue gases agree with those reported recently for a German prebake smelter, the specific emissions were found to be considerably lower.

<P>PERFLUOROCARBON (PFC) GENERATION IN LABORATORY-SCALE ALUMINUM REDUCTION CELLS</B>: Steen Nissen, <I>Donald R. Sadoway,</I> Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307
<P>
The generation of CF4 and C2F6 is being studied in a laboratory-scale aluminum reduction cell. During electrolysis in well behaved cells and in cells on anode effect, anode gases have been analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) on-line. Process parameters have been systematically varied to determine how PFC generation depends upon anode material (industrial pre-bake and S&oslash;derberg), bath ratio (1.45, 1.15 and 0.56), LiF concentration (0 and 2.7%), current density (0.7 A cm-2 and higher), and temperature (970 and 800&#176;C). Measurements agree with those reported for industrial cells with respect to total PFC level as well as the ratio of CF4 to C2F6. The main factor determining PFC concentration appears to be the anodic overvoltage. The functional relationship between the rate of PFC generation and anodic overvoltage is derived from the current-overpotential equation. Research sponsor: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Division.

<P>REDUCTION OF THE CF4 EMISSIONS FROM PRE-BAKED HALL HEROULT CELLS</B>: <I>Frank M. Kimmerle</I>, Gilles Potvin, Alcan International Ltd., Arvida Research and Development Centre, P.O. Box 1250, Jonquiere, QC, G7S-4K8, Canada; John T. Pisano, Unisearch Ass. Inc., 222 Snidercroft Rd., Concord, ONT, L4K 1B5, Canada
<P>
It has been established that CF4 and C2F6 are given off from the Hall-Heroult electrolysis cells during so-called anode effects. The introduction of a novel alumina feeding and cell operation algorithm in the Grande Baie smelter operating with P155 pre-bake electrolysis cells, has dramatically reduced the anode effect duration and anode effect frequency. The implementation of the new cell control logic constituted a unique opportunity to compare data from some two hundred events before and after commissioning on identical cells. Using tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry we measured PFC emissions from individual anode effects with a temporal resolutions of as little as 8 seconds. This communication will describe the experimental set-up, present the decrease in PFC emissions attained, discuss the CF4/C2F6 ratios observed and compare the data observed with model predictions.

<P>
The laser hydrogen fluoride measuring instrument described at TMS '95 was compared with an optimised eighty-fold array of air sampling cassettes over a 400m path in a potroom of the Tomago (NSW) aluminium smelter. Thirteen one-hour comparison trials were performed at average HF concentrations over the range 0.07-3.7 mg/Nm3. For the twelve concentrations up to 2.0 mg/Nm3 the cassette array average and the laser average correlated with a slope of 0.93 and a regression coefficient r2=0.98. For the nine points up to 1.5 mg/Nm3 the slope was 1.02 and the regression coefficient r2=0.99. As configured during the comparison trial the laser instrument did not correctly indicate the 3.7 mg/Nm3 HF concentration due to insufficient signal to noise ratio. The correlation between array and laser was considered very good. The technique is being commercialised.

<P>THE MEASUREMENT OF GASEOUS FLUORIDE IN THE ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY:</B><I> John M. Jones,</I> Anglesey Aluminium Metal Ltd., Penrhos Works, P.O. Box 4, Holyhead, Gwynedd, LL65-2UJ, United Kingdom
<P>
The introduction of integrated Pollution Control (IPC) by means of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA 90), has brought with it regulatory requirements for operators of industrial processes in the U.K. to undertake continuous monitoring of gaseous atmospheric releases. In response to these changes Anglesey Aluminium Metal Limited (AAM) has chosen to install Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy (TDLAS). This method, operating in the Middle Infra Red region (MIR), is gaining increased acceptance as the choice for trace gas measurement where sensitivity, specificity, and fast response are required. This paper focuses on this change to the gaseous fluoride monitoring activities at AAM with particular attention to stack monitoring.

<P>IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES IN THE DRY SCRUBBING PROCESS:</B><I> Geir Wedde</I>, ABB Environmental, P.O. Box 6260 Etterstad, 0603 Oslo, Norway
<P>
An advanced process for removal and recovery of fluorides and particulates from the aluminium reduction pot gas has been developed and tested in pilot plant prior to full scale installation. The dry scrubbing process is arranged in two stages with a counter-current flow of the alumina allowing for the reactive fresh alumina at the tail end of the process. The benefits and features of this concept include high process flexibility with stable and improved performance on removal of fluorides, reduced pressure drop and low particulate emission by optimized filter design and operating performance, and improved compactness through design and equipment developments.

<P>TGT RI - A NOVEL REACTOR / FILTER CONCEPT FOR DRY SCRUBBING</B>: <I>B. Cloutier</I>, Procedair Industries Inc., 625 President Kennedy, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1K2; Ph. Dumortier, B. Caratge, Procedair SA, 25-27 Boulevard de la Paix, 78951 St. Germain en Laye Cedex, France
<P>
<P>The fluorine emissions from modern PFPB pots have led to a requirement to further improve gas scrubbing efficiency. This improvement has been achieved without any detrimental effect on scaling or attrition of alumina. Economic factors create a further technical challenge of reducing capital cost and lowering energy consumption. A novel process called the TGT-RI which combines an innovative reactor concept integrated in a new generation of fabric filter fully responds to the new requirements of aluminium producers. Several years of exhaustive tests have been conducted on gases emitted by large pots to develop the TGT filter and then the TGT-RI concept of integrating the reactor within the filter unit. The paper will incorporate a comprehensive set of test results. A descriptive of the first industrial applications on pot gases and baking furnaces is presented.

<P>IMPLEMENTATION OF POINT FEEDING IN THE S&Oslash;DERBERG LINES AT HYDRO ALUMINUM KARM&Oslash;Y:</B> <I>Knut Arne Paulsen,</I> Willy K.

<P>
A concept for point feeding of alumina to S&oslash;derberg cells has been developed at Hydro Aluminum Karm&oslash;y. During 1996 and early 1997 the bar breaker equipment on all 340 cells will be replaced by point feeders. Alumina is fed by means of a fluidized feeder and mechanically forced into the bath. The lifetime of the equipment is comparable to that of the cathode life. The concept has proved to stabilize the operation of the cell. Furthermore, the stability improves the current efficiency and also allows the amperage to be increased. Implementation of point feeding includes revised operational procedures and new target values for the operational parameters and also affects the organization. The anode effect frequency has been reduced in several steps during the development period. Today, the anode effect frequency is about one tenth of the corresponding value for the previous bar breaker cells resulting in reduction of perfluorocarbon emissions.

<P>
<P>The majority of Russian aluminum smelting technology is S&oslash;derberg, historically associated with non-competitive performance and ecological problems. After conversion to conventional prebake cell technology was found economically unjustifiable, the Nadvoitsky Aluminium Smelter, Karelia, Russia commissioned the All-Russia Aluminium and Magnesium Institute and Kaiser Aluminum Technical Services Inc. to design a unique prebake technology cell with world class performance which could be economically retrofitted into the existing facility. This multi-national team utilizing state of the art modeling and process control technology, successfully designed and implemented a twelve pot test section at Nadvoitsy. Cell performance measured over twelve months has consistently exceeded minimum design indices and paces world class cell performance. Measurements of magnetic field, heat flow, and voltage distribution compare closely with predicted values. Design features, including a novel six anode superstructure, design methodology, test protocol, construction and operation practices, and cell performance data are presented in this paper.

<P>BATH TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WITH THERMOCOUPLES</B>: <I>Paul Verstreken, </I>Heraeus Electro-Nite Int. N.V., Grote Baan 27a, 3530-Houthalen, Belgium
<P>
<P>After a brief introduction into the physical principles of thermoelectricity an overview of commonly used thermocouples is given. The construction of thermocouple sensors and assemblies is discussed. An overview of calibration procedures is given. Errors can arise from the materials (thermocouple wires and sheathing) used, and the way the actual measurement is performed. Reasons for drifting are discussed. There is a relation between the thermal properties (thermal mass and heat conductivity) of the sheathing material, the measuring procedure and the obtained accuracy of the temperature measurement. From this, recommendations on how to improve the quality of bath temperature readings, are made.

<P>
<P>A new instrument, with a single-chip microcomputer as its core and based on a new method named Dynamic Temperature Measurement, has been developed for fast temperature measurement in aluminium reduction cells. When a cold thermocouple is inserted into hot electrolyte, the instrument measures the thermocouple output curve and meantime identifies the parameters of a time series-analysis model which is used to describe the temperature-time curve. Until the convergence of the identification is verified, the instrument predicts the temperature of the electrolyte from the obtained information. In the way, the temperature can be indicated before the thermocouple output reaches its balance point, with the measurement process lasting only some 50 seconds and measurement accuracy reaching &#177;2&#176;C, a range acceptable for industrial measurement.

A DEVICE FOR CONTINUOUS ALUMINA FEED INTO AN ALUMINIUM ELECTRIC CELL</B>: <I>A.I. Begunov</I>, E.V. Kudryavtseva, State Technical University, Lermontov Str. 83, Irkutsk, Russia
<P>
A new device is suggested here to cover the cell and feed alumina into it. The covering is designed having such thermal resistance that no crust develops on the electrolyte surface. Alumina is fed from the intermediate hopper, which is one piece with the covering plate, into the electrolyte through the narrow slot, the width of which ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The alumina feed rate is determined by its bulk properties (&quot;sandy&quot;, &quot;mealy&quot;, &quot;moist&quot;), the width and length of the slot and the intermediate hopper wall flare angle. The cold model of the device yielded the dependencies of alumina slot spead on the parameters mentioned above. The device has no crust-breaking appliances or volumetric dosers. Dosage is effected only to gravity feed of raw materials through a slot of predetermined cross-section. Because of that, low operation costs and high reliability of the suggested device are expected.

VISUALISATION OF TAPPING OPERATIONS:</B> <I>Marcus Walker,</I> Comalco Research Centre, P.O. Box 316, Thomastown, Australia 3074
<P>
<P>The removal of molten aluminium from Hall- Heroult cells is known a &quot;tapping&quot;. This operation causes process disturbances including entrainment of electrolyte and sludge in the tapped metal as well as producing localised wear of the cathode. This paper describes the use of a full scale physical model for determining the optimal tapping conditions to reduce both bath entrainment and cathode erosion for various cell operating strategies. Flow visualisation and numerical modelling has shown that the flow towards the tapping pipe is predominantly radial, however under and inside the pipe, the flow swirls intensely. Under certain conditions the swirling flow induces a vortex at the bath metal interface through which bath can be entrained in the flow. The swirling action was also seen to produce a region of locally high velocities on the cathode surface which enhances erosion of the cathode through a number of possible mechanisms.

<P>
<P>Techmo has elaborated a new concept of resolving the problem of ladle cleaning based on standard features of the new aluminium smelter implemented by Hydro Aluminium's technology at SLOVALCO a.s. A thorough design work has resulted in a piece of equipment with new arrangement and orientation in good agreement with the tapping system and work organization of the plant. Some optimization was fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the new plant in possible best manner.

COMMISSIONING OF ALUSAF HILLSIDE SMELTER REDUCTION POTS: </B> <I>Jean-Paul Aussel</I>, Jean-Claude Frison, Aluminium Pechiney, Licensing Department, BP 7, FR-38340 Voreppe, France; Shaun Kroutz, <I>Gideon Stander</I>, Alusaf Hillside Smelter, P.O. Box 897, RSA 3900 Richards Bay, Republic of South Africa<P>
From the 18th of June 1995 to the 21st of June 1996, Alusaf Hillside Smelter started the 576 AP30 reduction pots of its two potlines. The promising results achieved by the first stabilized pots allowed the Process management team to finely tune the potlines around 310 kA and to achieve current efficiency in excess of 95.5% and energy consumption very close to 13000 kWh/t during the first half of 1996. The results of these first 6 months of operation of the first full potline are discussed. It includes data on the raw materials, the organisation and the training programs of the Reduction Department which were all instrumental in engineering this success. The evolution of the Reduction Process parameters and results described in the paper will be updated for the final presentation with the available data of both potlines.

FROM 110 TO 175 kA: RETROFIT OF VAW RHEINWERK. PART I: MODERNIZATION CONCEPT:</B> <I>D. Vogelsang, </I>I. Eick, M. Segatz, Ch. Droste, VAW Aluminium-Technologie, G.-v.-Boeselager-Str. 25, D-53117 Bonn, Germany<P>
Modernization of the 210,000 tpy VAW Rheinwerk smelter includes installation of point feeder, alumina conveying system, state-of-the-art pot control system and forsees an increase in amperage of up to 175 kA. For the modernized pots, concepts for the potlining as well as for improvements of the busbar system were developed, based solely on computer simulations. For the layout of the potlining a new three-dimensional thermoelectric cell model was applied that allows prediction of side ledge countours as well as heat and voltage balances. Based on this model the choice of semi-graphitic vs. fully graphitized cathode blocks was evaluate with respect to the anticipated increase in system amperage. Temperature fields and side ledge contours predicted are in good agreement with measurements. The busbar system, designed originally for a current load of 110 kA, was improved in a very efficient manner to cope with the higher amperage. Magneto-hydrodynamic simulations predicted and plant measurements demonstrated significant improvements in cell stability and performance.

FROM 110 TO 175 kA: RETROFIT OF VAW RHEINWERK. PART II: CONSTRUCTION &amp;</B> <B>OPERATION:</B> <I>J. Ghosh</I>, A. Steube, B. Levenig, VAW Aluminium AG, Koblenzer Str. 122, D-41468 Neuss, Germany<P>
Construction, start-up and operation of ten retrofitted 165 kA prebaked pilot cells in the Rheinwerk smelter are described. The excellent performance of these pots led to the DM 40 Mill. investment decision to retrofit all three potlines. The hot-change of cells during full potline operation minimizes production losses. The pilot cells are equipped with improved steel shells and lining, modified busbar system and modern pot controller and point-feeding system. To evaluate the most cost-effective solution with best performance, four cells are provided with two point feeders and six cells with three point feeders. The new-developed VAW-ELAS process controlling system with improved algorithms and a user-friendly graphical interface allows system
 atic surveillance and interpretation of all pot parameters and has a major contribution to the highly improved pot performance.

DEVELOPMENT OF A 200 kA REDUCTION CELL TECHNOLOGY - CD200:</B> <I>Geoff Bearne</I>, Mark Dunn, Comalco Research Centre, P.O. Box 316, Thomastown 3074 Australia; Mike Roberts, Yousef Ali Mohamed, Dubai Aluminium Co. Ltd., P.O. Box 3627, Dubai, United Arab Emirates<P>
In 1990, Comalco and Dubai Aluminium Co. Ltd. (Dubai) joined forces to develop a modern high amperage reduction cell design known as the CD200. This technology was aimed at the 190 to 200 kA operating range. It was designed to be compatible with future expansion plans at Dubai as well as at the Comalco managed New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd. (NZAS) plant, while remaining within the scope of the present anode design. The cell incorporated a cathode lining design and alumina feeding technology which had been successfully demonstrated at NZAS. The bus bar system was developed using computer modelling at the Comalco Research Centre (CRC). Dubai provided the financial investment and operational experience as well as improvements in process control strategies. Five cells were installed in Dubai's potline 4 and these have operated since 1991. During the last five years, there have been changes to the bus bar design and cathode lining, introduction of larger anodes and further enhancements of the process control systems and operating practices. As a result, the operational performance and the power efficiency of the prototype cells have met or exceeded all targets. Subsequently, the technology has been selected for expansions at both NZAS and Dubai. NZAS has installed 48 cells to be operated at 190 kA, with commissioning from mid 1996. 2 is installing 240 cells to be operated at 195 kA, with start up scheduled in September 1996.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE ELECTRICAL PREHEAT TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE START-UP OF THE CD200 PROTOTYPES AT DUBAI ALUMINUM CO. LTD:</B> <I>Mark R. Dunn</I>, Comalco Research Centre, P.O. Box 316, Thomastown 3074 Australia; Q.M.I. Galadari, Dubai Aluminum Co. Ltd., P.O. Box 3627, Dubai, United Arab Emirates<P>
In 1991 the Dubai Aluminum Co. Ltd. And Comalco Research &amp; Technology set up a joint project to develop a 200 kA cell in a facility attached to the end of Dubai's potline 4 (then under construction). One aspect of this project was the development and assessment of a suitable electrical preheat practice, based on Dubai's current methods. This paper reports on the process used and the extensive monitoring that took place during the preheats. The effect of current distribution control was also quantified in terms of cathode temperature variation.

ELECTRIC POWER CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING SMELTER ECONOMICS:</B> <I>Nolan E. Richards,</I> 117 Kingswood Dri., Florence, AL 35630; Helge O. Forberg, 8A Quail Ridge Court, Owensboro, KY 42303<P>
The cost of electric power for smelters varies from less than 15% to more than 35% of operating costs. For a smelter with a high power rate, it becomes important to obtain a premium in the market for finished products, produce a higher proportion of premium grade metal, increase volume supplemented with purchased scrap, reduce other cost factors or negotiate a power contract that would allow power modulation. The large difference in cost of power demand between a peak period, normally between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., and the no-peak period can give some smelters the opportunity to negotiate advantageous contracts for reductions in demand of 20-30% during the peak period. Provided the smelter can implement the changes necessary in the operating procedures to maintain control of potroom operations during the modulations, the decreased power rate can have a substantial beneficial affect on the plant's economics. Some of the strategies and major changes which could be considered for a reduction plant to improve economics are discussed in this paper.

CAPACITY CREEP - THE HIDDEN POTENTIAL GROWTH OF ALUMINIUM SMELTING CAPACITY:</B> <I>K. J. Driscoll</I>, CRU International, Ltd., London WC1X 0AD, England<P>

Given the lack of firm expansion plans for aluminium smelting capacity over the next few years, many people are expecting a smelter bottleneck to develop towards the end of the century. However, CRU believes that a potential source of capacity growth, which we call &quot;capacity creep&quot;, is being ignored. As well as new greenfield and brownfield expansions which might fill the new capacity requirements, incremental production gains at existing smelters can be achieved through lower cost upgrades or improvements in operational efficiencies. Indeed, we believe that such capacity creep has historically added around 0.50-0.75% per year to industry capacity, although many of these capacity increases remain undocumented. This paper will present the results of an extensive study of the potential for growth in aluminium smelting capacity, in which we will review how and where capacity creep has occurred, and show that the potential for further capacity creep remains substantial.

ORGANISATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS: WHERE INTEGRATION COMES:</B> <I>S.A. Ferre,</I> Aluminium P&eacute;chiney, 235 Avenue Alsace Lorraine, 73007 Chambery Cedex, France; P.W. Cowie, Alusaf Limited, 9 West Central Arterial, P.O. Box 897, Richards Bay 3900, Republic of South Africa<P>
Managing an aluminium plant within a concurrential environment demands a greater use of leading edge technology. This technology is of course related to the smelting process but also deals with the organisation scheme and the information provided. During the engineering phase and the construction phase of the Alusaf smelter, Aluminium Pechiney has provided Alusaf with the AP30 technology and has elaborated an organisation with its SA partner. The design and the construction of the information systems have been done in partnership between AP and Alusaf. The information system is based on the use of the state-of-the-art technology and more important is really designed to fit the organisation and to evolve with it. It is built using the 4 classic levels of the CIM model. It takes advantage of packages as SAP R/3 and Microsoft Office Suite tools for routine processes and uses specific developments defined by AP and is used by Alusaf to implement value-adding processes.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE ALUMINIUM CELL LINING BEHAVIOUR BY USING SiC: </B>M.M. Ali, <I>A.A. Mostafa</I>, R&amp;D Management, The Aluminium Company of Egypt, Naga Hamadi, Egypt
<P>
Now, the finite element analysis techniques (FEA) are widely used in the aluminium reduction cells. For example, to select new lining materials or to better understanding of the aluminium cell behaviour, through the use of modelling concepts. One of the important studies is the thermal model of the aluminium reduction cells. A 2-D FEA model has been established, tested and verified to study the thermal balance of the cell. This paper presents a study for using a new lining material. The effect of this material on the ledge profile and thermal distribution were discussed.

PROPERTIES OF A COLLOIDAL ALUMINA-BONDED TiB2-COATING ON CATHODE CARBON MATERIALS</B>: <I>H.A. &Oslash;ye, </I>Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7034 Trondheim, Norway; V. de Nora, J.-J. Duruz, G. Johnston, MOLTECH S.A., 9 Route de Troinex, 1227 Carouge, Geneva, Switzerland
<P>
Laboratory studies of colloidal alumina-bonded TiB2 have been carried out. The following properties have been demonstrated: Thermal expansion somewhat higher than carbon materials, electrical conductivity of the same order as graphite, porosity of coating <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif">30%, resistance to sodium is high if the coating is protected by infiltrated aluminium, strong adherence of the coating to carbon materials even after thermal cycling, high abrasion resistance of the coating, wettability of the coating by liquid aluminium, the coating's action as a barrier to sodium penetration. The barrier action to sodium is the ability to form a stable liquid aluminium layer in the pores of the coating which will slow down the reaction: Al(l)+3 NaF(in electrolyte)=3 Na(in C cathode)+ AlF3 (in electrolyte) as the sodium stabilizing C is no longer in close contact with the bath.

PENETRATION FORCE OF BATH COMPONENTS INTO POT LININGS DESCRIBED BY NONEQUILlBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS: </B><I>Stig F.

<P>
From principles of irreversible thermodynamics, a simple expression is developed for the driving force for transport of bath constituents across a non-isothermal matrix into the refractory lining in aluminium electrolysis furnaces. The expression shows that the transport outwards of aggressive substances is favoured by the temperature gradient. Possible applications are demonstrated for 3 penetrating gases with a variety of applied and proposed refractory materials. Common to all results is a possible reduction of the rate of penetration into barriers by a smaller temperature gradient due to the entropies of reaction. This can be accomplished by proper heat insulation below. A set of conclusions regarding the resistance of chemical barriers to penetration by bath components completes the paper.

FLUORIDE ATTACK ON ALUMINO-SILICATE REFRACTORIES IN ALUMINIUM ELECTROLYSIS CELLS</B><I>: J&oslash;rn Rutlin,</I> Tor Grande, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
The phase relations in the system sodium fluoride - mullite are relevant to chemical reactions that take place in fireclay based refractory materials used in the bottom lining of aluminium electrolysis cells. The solid-liquid phase relations have been investigated by means of differential thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction analysis and microscopy. At sub solidus temperatures the four compounds sodium fluoride, cryolite, nepheline and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-alumina have been found at excess amount of sodium fluoride. At lower concentration of sodium fluoride, corundum is formed at the expense of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-alumina. The solidus temperature was observed at 857&#177;5&#176;C which corresponds well with results in systems with higher aluminium fluoride content. An apparent eutectic was observed at 12&#177;0.5 mole% mullite. Nepheline and cryolite are the two main components of the melt crystallizing at the solidus temperature. The liquidus temperature at the solubility limit was observed at 943&#176;C and at 7.5&#177;0.5 mole% mullite. The present results are discussed in relation to the deterioration mechanism of alumino-silicate refractories.

PYROHYDROLYSIS OF SPENT POTLINING:</B> Vladimir Blinov, <I>Tor Grande</I>, Harald A. &Oslash;ye, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Due to the toxic nature of spent potlining (SPL) this is becoming one of the major environmental concerns for the aluminium industry today. SPL also represents a major recovery potential because of its fluoride and energy content. The Elkem SPL recycling process is one of several technically feasible alternatives for treatment and recycling of SPL. In this process the fluorides can potentially be recovered by a pyrohydrolysis of the oxyfluoride silicate slag from the Elkem process. The thermodynamic aspects of this pyrohydrolysis are discussed in the present work. Chemical activity of fluorides in actual oxyfluoride silicate melts has been determined by means of high temperature mass spectroscopy and the Knudsen effusion method. Only sodium fluoride was observed as volatile species for dry melts. The chemical activity of sodium fluoride in several melts could therefore be determined by the Knudsen effusion method. Together with data on the activity of sodium oxide, the present activity data of sodium fluoride enable a calculation of the equilibrium pressure of HF during pyrohydrolysis of SPL.

IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR SWELLING PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION OF ALUMINUM REDUCTION CELL</B>: <I>H.S. Sayed,</I> Structural Eng. Dept., Cairo University, Egypt; M.M. Megahed, Mechanical Eng. and Prod. Dept., Cairo University, Egypt; F. Dawi, S. Abdella, R&amp;E Dept., EgyptAlum Co, Nagi Hammadi, Egypt
<P>
The swelling pressure has the most significant effect on determining the cathode life among other loads applied on the steel casing of the aluminium reduction cell. In previous research, an identification technique is applied to determine the average swelling pressure value that is exerted on the side wall of the cell. The identification technique made use of the measured deformation of the cathode steel casing at different elapsed times (after 88 and 615 days) on an existing cathode that belongs to EgyptAlum. A new set of measurements has been conducted at different elapsed time (after 1055 days). This new set of measurements has been conducted at different elapsed times (after 1055 days). This new set of measurements gives a unique opportunity to reassess the identified swelling parameters. On the other hand, the distribution of the swelling pressure along the cathode interface with the vertical steel walls of the cell, has a significant effect on the performance of the steel casing. In this paper, the distribution of the swelling pressure, the interface of the carbon blocks and the steel casing, are identified. A nonlinear elasto-plastic model for the steel casing using combination of shell and beam elements is developed. The carbon blocks are modeled using solid and truss elements. The model utilizes Dewing model that describes the swelling pressure as a function of the elapsed time and confined swelling strain rate to determine the swelling pressure distribution. The swelling pressure is initiated using a predetermined free and confined swelling rate. As a nonlinear analysis progress with item, the confined swelling rate of the previous time step is used to assess the swelling pressure at the interface for the subsequent steps. The swelling pressure distribution is then determined at any elapsed time.

MODELLING OF DYNAMIC LEDGE HEAT TRANSFER: </B>Chuck C. Wei, <I>John J.J. Chen, </I>Barry J.

Voller, University of Minnesota, Dept. of Civil &amp; Mineral Engineering, Minneapolis, USA; M.P. Taylor, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Company Ltd., Invercargill, New Zealand
<P>
Cell disturbances such as anode effect and process operations such as feeding, anode changing and metal-tapping often cause variations in the heat balance of a reduction cell, resulting in deviations from the optimum operating conditions. A dynamic ledge heat transfer model built on an earlier one-dimensional dynamic simulation by the authors and based on the finite difference method was used to solve the transient heat conduction with phase change in the sidewall/ledge region. Fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacings were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and ledge region in order to track the moving front. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were considered.

UNDERSTANDING BOUNDARY-LAYERS:</B> <I>Warren Haupin</I>, 2820 Seventh Street Road, Lower Burrell, PA 15068
<P>
Understanding the physics and chemistry of boundary-layers, the thin stagnant zones that form at each bath interface, clarifies many cell phenomena. A non-wetting boundary at the anode causes the anode effect. The effect of bath velocity on the boundary-layer thickness and its effect on the heat transfer coefficient coupled with bath temperature and bath composition explains the formation and loss of frozen ledge and its relationship to heat losses from the cell walls. Similarly, the boundary-layer at the bath-aluminum interface ex plains cathodic overvoltage, the sodium content of the aluminum, current efficiency and the relationship of each to metal pad stability (magneto-hydrodynamic stability).

ON THE COMPOSITION OF SOLID DEPOSITS FROZEN OUT FROM CRYOLITIC MELTS:</B> <I>Asbj&oslash;rn Solheim</I>, Lisbet I. R. St&oslash;en, SINTEF Materials Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Thermodynamically, the primary crystallization product formed by cooling a melt containing cryolite, AlF3, Al2O3 and CaF2 is expected to be cryolite with minor amounts of CaF2 and AlF3 in solid solution. In practice, however, any deposit frozen out from such melts may contain considerable amounts of bath constituents other than cryolite. The factors governing the composition of the freeze are studied theoretically and by experiment. Besides solid solution, the composition depends on two factors, 1) diffusion of bath constituents from the surface of the deposit towards the bulk of the melt, and 2) dendritic crystal growth with subsequent trapping of bath between the crystals. The condition which gives dendrite formation is formulated. Based on this criterion, a deposit frozen out from melts containing excess AlF3 and alumina would contain more AlF3 than a deposit frozen out from a melt containing excess AlF3 alone. This was confirmed by experiment.

THE GAS UNDER ANODES IN SMELTING CELLS. Part I: MEASURING AND MODELLING BUBBLE RESISTANCE UNDER HORIZONTAL DE-ORIENTED ELECTRODES: </B><I>T. M. Hyde</I>, B. J. Welch, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand
<P>
With a continuing drive to reduce energy and the tighter operating tolerances of modern aluminium smelting cells, there is an ever increasing need for a precise cell voltage equation. Precise correlation exists for the electrical conductivity in smelting cells, the reverse is not the case for the added resistance effect of gas bubbles. Where it has been allowed for, the models used have been based on those proposed for vertically oriented electrodes. Furthermore the measurements on which the model is based can be influenced by other electrochemical changes while the shape and dispersion and gas bubble differ from those expected in aluminium smelting cells based on model studies. An apparatus and high speed switching data acquisition technique have been developed to allow the ohmic resistance of a molten salt electrolyte to be isolated from all other contributors. Ceramic objects of known geometry, size and volume, rest in the electrolyte immediately under the upper electrode (anode) thus simulating gas bubbles. The technique developed enables the measurement of the direct increase in resistance due to the introduced volume of non-conducting simulated gas. The bubble parameters examined included volume, electrode coverage, depth and shape. The resulting data have been tested against existing models.

THE GAS UNDER ANODES IN SMELTING CELLS. Part II: GAS VOLUME AND BUBBLE LAYER CHARACTERISTICS: </B>R. Aaberg, V. Ranum, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7034 Trondheim, Norway; K. Williamson, <I>B. J. Welch</I>, Department of Chemical &amp; Materials Engineering, The University of Auckland, New Zealand
<P>
Recent physical models have suggested that the gas bubbles formed under anodes in smelting cells tend to coalesce and release as large bubbles predominantly. Whilst it is well established that the gas bubbles increase the cell resistance, and correlations proposed include the gas volume or bubble layer depth and surface coverage. However, the volume and degree of coverage of the electrodes have been subject to speculation rather than accurate measurements. In this investigation, using a larger than normal laboratory cell, it has been confirmed that the gas released is consistent with the physical models with most of the gas being evolved in discreet large bubbles. The release frequency is similar to the dominant frequency found in operating cells. The average gas volume under an anode prior to release is between 0.4 and 0.5 cm3 per cm2 of electrode. From combined resistance studies it has been calculated that approximately two thirds of the anode is covered with gas at release with an average bubble thickness of 5 mm.

<P>
A micropyretically synthesised porous Ni-Fe-Cu-Al intermetallic composite electrode has been developed for use as a non-consumable anode in the Hall H&eacute;roult cell. The oxidation behavior in air and under electrolysis conditions have been studied. The electrode is noted to be resistant to the corrosive conditions encountered during electrolysis for up to 300 hour tests in 10 Amp and 100 Amp cells. The synthesis procedures for the manufacture of the electrodes and the beneficial influence of the pores are discussed. Preliminary results on the metal contamination during electrolysis are also presented.

APPLICATION OF NONEQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS TO THE LEDGE SURFACE OF ALUMINIUM ELECTROLYSIS CELLS</B>: <I>Ellen Marie Hansen</I>, Signe Kjelstrup, Department of Physical Chemistry, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Nonequilibrium thermodynamics for surfaces has been applied to the interface ledge-electrolyte in aluminium electrolysis cells. The method describes the interface as a layer of finite thickness <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">, having a bath-like part and a ledge-like part, with properties differing from the bulk properties. The method can explain the heat transfer coefficient for the interface in a new way, namely as a combination of the thermal conductivities in the two parts of the interface. Examples are given to show how the temperature &quot;jump&quot; between the two bulk phases may either be located in the ledge-like part of the interface, in the bath-like part, or in both. In analysis of ledge growth, the possibility of different surface temperatures should be taken into account, because this temperature may, together with the temperatures close to the interface on both sides, determine the rate of freezing or melting. It is also shown how the simple steady state model can be expanded into a dynamic one.

<P>
The concept of properties of electrolyte melts under the same solvability of alumina at nonequal temperature, that is, the properties of melts under equal solvability of alumina dissolving in the electrolyte at the temperature which is 20&#176;C above the liquidus, were put forward. Based on this theory, the physico-chemical properties, such as the initial crystallization temperature, solvability of alumina, conductivity, density of (2.23-3.0) NaF&#183;AlF3 - (0-5%) LiF - (0-15 %) CaF2 system were studied. The results will provide more scientific basis for choosing the optimum electrolyte composition in aluminium electrolysis.

MEASUREMENTS OF HF IN STACKS AND POT ROOMS USING A REMOTE SENSING EYE-SAFE LASER INSTRUMENT:</B><I> H.I. Schiff</I>, Unisearch Associates, Inc., 222 Suidercroft Rd., Concord, Ontario, Canada L4K 1B5
<P>
A remote sensing system for continuous measurement of HF and other gases has been developed based on eye-safe turnable gases. The laser, its controls and data acquisition system are contained in a small instrument which can be located anywhere in the plant, such as the control room. The optical beam is transported to one or more stacks or ducts by fibre optics which may be kilometres in length. It is then directed across the stack and returned by a retroreflector to the same optical fibre and retroreflector combination for pot-room or roof-top monitoring. The use of optical multiplexing permits a single instrument to make simultaneous measurements at a number of locations providing a very cost effective system which can operate in any environment. Systems have been installed in four Canadian smelters and one in the UK. Examples of some of the measurements made with these systems will be presented.

ON THE BATH FLOW, ALUMINA DISTRIBUTION AND ANODE GAS RELEASE IN ALUMINIUM CELLS</B>: <I>Ove Kobbeltvedt,</I> Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; Bj&oslash;rn P. Moxnes, Hydro Aluminium, Technology Centre &Aring;rdal, N-5870 &Oslash;vre &Aring;rdal, Norway<P>
The bath flow was studied in prebake cells. The measurements were performed by recording the drop in bath temperature subsequent to alumina feeding as well as by measuring the wear of quartz rods immersed in the bath. The horizontal flow rate varied between 3 and 20 cm/s. It was found that the horizontal bath flow and consequently the alumina distribution pattern are determined mainly by a combined effect of the magnetic fields and the width of the channels above the working surface of the anodes. The quantity of anode gas which was drained into the centre channel was measured at different locations in a cell. The result showed that the distribution of the anode gas in the bath is strongly associated with the magnetic fields.

ALUMINA DISTRIBUTION IN POINT-FED HALL-HEROULT CELLS:</B> <I>K. T&oslash;rklep, </I>K. Kalgraf, T. Nordb&oslash;, Elkem a/s Research, P.O. Box 8040 Vaagsbygd, N-4602 Kristiansand, Norway<P>
We describe the alumina concentration distribution in point-fed Hall cells in terms of finite physical elements. The need arose in the development of the New S&oslash;derberg technology at Elkem Aluminium ANS, but the technique is applied to prebake pots as well. The concentration at any point in the bath is computed from the dynamical equilibrium between consumption and transport of alumina (directly or indirectly dissolved) and presented as contour plots. Necessary inputs are the velocity field in the bath and the turbulent diffusivity, either measured or calculated. We prefer to measure both by injecting a small amount of a molten radioactive tracer and follow the distribution of this tracer <I>in situ.</I> Measured velocity fields have been found to vary significantly between presumed identical pots and over time. This is mainly ascribed to convective coupling with the metal, where the boundary conditions and hence the driving forces may well differ between pots and change with time. Contrary to extant models, our approach permits experimental verification through comparison of predicted and measured oxide concentrations at various locations in the pot under investigation.

METAL PAD WAVE ANALYSIS USING FAST ANODE LOWERING METHOD:</B> <I>H. Q. Tang</I> and N. Urata, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation, Center for Technology, P.O. Box 877, Pleasanton, CA 94566<P>
In order to study the metal pad wave in aluminum reduction cells, the two step fast anode lowering method was developed and applied to the operating cells. The metal pad waves after anode lowering were measured and analyzed. The period and shapes of the metal pad waves were determined by performing Fourier transform analysis of the measured data. The MHD wave equations were solved for cells of different magnetic fields to simulate the metal pad waves caused by this fast anode lowering. The period and shapes of the predicted steady state waves were in good agreement with the measured waves, although the measured wave had more transient nature. The cell stability was evaluated based on the metal pad wave analysis.

IMPURITY TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>M. Webster,</I> Xiaoling Liu, Comalco Research Centre, Thomastown, Victoria, Australia; J. Metson, Department of Chemistry, University of Auckland, New Zealand<P>
The purity of aluminum from pre-bake reduction cells is affected by the quantity of impurities introduced with the raw materials and the fraction of these reporting to the metal. The transport of Ti, V, Ga, Si, Fe and Ni from the reduction cell to the duct emissions stream has been studied for point feeder and bar break cells. Samples of material from bath, cell cover and duct emissions have been examined and analysed for a range of impurities. For elements with volatile, bath generated fluoride compounds, the impurity content of the cover and duct samples is proportional to the carbon content. Carbon grains with thick (&gt;10 micron) impurity rich surface coatings are observed in both the loose cover samples and particles from bath skimmings. Thus a possible mechanism for the transport of these impurities may be postulated.

PSEUDO RESISTANCE CURVES FOR ALUMINIUM CELL CONTROL--ALUMINA DISSOLUTION AND CELL DYNAMICS</B>: <I>Halvor Kvande</I>, Hydro Aluminium a.s, P.O. Box 80, N-1321 Stabekk, Norway; Bj&oslash;rn P. Moxnes, J&oslash;rn Skaar, Per A. Solli, Hydro AIuminium a.s, Technology Centre &Aring;rdal, P.O. Box 303, N-5870 &Oslash;vre &Aring;rdal, Norway<P>
The pseudo resistance was measured as a function of the alumina concentration in the bath in five different types of cells. The pseudo resistance showed a minimum value of 5.0 to 5.5 mass% Al2O3, when the bath samples were analyzed by the LECO method. To the left of the minimum point on the curve the slope increased gradually until the anode effect occurred at 1.6 to 2.2 mass% Al2O3, while a nearly linear curve was found in some of the measurements. The difference in pseudo resistance determined just prior to the anode effect and at the minimum point, corresponded to a voltage difference between 100 and 300 mV. Immediately after the alumina feeding rate was reduced from overfeeding to underfeeding, a so-called &quot;hysteresis effect&quot; could be observed. This was characterized by a sudden decrease in cell voltage of about 100 mV in less than 30 minutes, in spite of practically constant bath composition and temperature in this time period. This effect may be caused by dissolution of alumina sludge in the bath phase <B>above</B> the metal pad, accumulated during the long overfeeding period of several hours, needed to reach concentrations to the right of the minimum point on the curve.

THE INFLUENCE OF SODIUM ON THE ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>Mohamed O. Ibrahiem</I>, Mohamed M. Ali, R&amp;D Department, Aluminium Company of Egypt, Naga Hamadi, Egypt<P>
Sodium always present in Hall-Heroult cells, has a decisive influence on cell performance and pot failure. In this paper, sodium was studied from three points of view. The first is the sodium mass balance. Alumina and cryolite are the major sources of sodium inputs to the electrolytic process, where 56.8% and 40.7% of sodium come from them, respectively. The second point is the sodium content in aluminium metal. Measured sodium content in aluminium of 203 kA prebaked cells is lower than that of 155 kA S&oslash;derberg due to lower bath ratio, higher excess aluminium fluoride, and higher magnetic fields. The third point is the study of sodium concentrations in failed carbon cathodes at different ages. This concentration at 3194 days is 8.5%, 7%, and 1% higher than that at 40, 60, and 1369 days, respectively.

STUDY ON CATHODIC PROCESS OF Na+ IN THREE-LAYER ELECTROLYTIC REFINING OF ALUMINIUM:</B> <I>Li Guohua,</I> Li Dianfeng, Zhao Xiangguo, Wang Qingna, Department of Nonferrous Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110006, China<P>
The Current-Voltage Method is adopted to study the cathodic process of Na+ in three-layer electrolytic refining of aluminium. The electrolyte studied is NaF-AlF3-BaCl2-NaCl molten system, whose composition is: NaF/AlF3 mole-ratio is 1.5-3.0, adding amount of NaCl is 0-8%, BaCl2 content is 60%. It is demonstrated that Na+ is not able to deposit on the aluminium cathode at the temperature range of 740-800&#176;C while the cathodic current density is 0.4-0.8 A/cm2. This conclusion provides an important basis for modifying the electrolyte in three-layer electrolytic refining of aluminium.

APPLICATIONS OF NEW STABILITY CRITERIA TO INDUSTRIAL CELL DESIGN:</B> <I>R.I. Lindsay</I>, P.A. Davidson, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, UK
<P>
Previous models of the behaviour of interfacial waves in aluminium reduction cells lead to distinct descriptions of the physical mechanisms involved and different stability criteria. We consider the implications of these criteria for cell design. A new wave equation has recently been developed from shallow-water theory, in which the Lorentz force is expressed explicitly in terms of the fluid motion. The simplicity of this new equation leads to a general energy criterion to establish which types of motion may be unstable. By expressing the new equation in matrix form, we obtain some unexpected results. We discuss the implications of some of these results for cell design. Finally, we introduce a new sufficient condition for the stability of standing waves in a finite domain, which does not require solving the governing equations. The use of Gershgorin's theorem allows us to place a lower bound on the critical value of the background magnetic field at which an instability first appears.

MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT OF ANODE SET PATTERN ON CELL PERFORMANCE</B>: <I>M. Segatz,</I> Ch. Droste, D. Vogelsang, VAW Aluminium-Technologie, G.-v.-Boeselager-Str. 25, D-53117 Bonn, Germany
<P>
Numerical simulation of coupled bath/metal magnetohydrodynamics (MIID) and MIID stability analysis allows the optimization of anode set pattern with respect to minimal cell disturbance. The contribution of anode gas induced forces and impact on the flow field are discussed. During a complete anode set cycle the anode current distribution changes significantly due to varying anode resistances, frozen bath and different metal pad heights. Typically the largest disturbance to cell stability occurs during a short time span after the anode change. With steady-state MIID simulations immediately before and after each anode change - in sequence of the underlying set pattern - the relevant cell current and ACD distribution are determined. The impact of these parameters on cell stability is predicted with a linear MIID stability analysis for a complete anode change cycle.

A NEW MODEL OF INTERFACIAL WAVES IN ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>P.A. Davidson</I>, R.I. Lindsay, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, U.K.
<P>
We develop a new wave equation for the liquid interface in aluminium reduction cells. It differs from previous models in that the Lorentz force is expressed explicitly in terms of the fluid motion. The equation is valid both for open domains and confined domains of arbitrary shape, and its simplicity makes the instability mechanism explicit. Our new equation predicts that both travelling waves and standing waves may become unstable by the same mecha nism and that the travelling wave instabilities are distinct to those uncovered in previous investigations. We also derive a simple yet general energy criterion which shows which types of motion may extract energy from the background magnetic field. This indicates that a rotating tilted interface is particularly prone to instability, and indeed such motions are often seen in practice.

SIMULATION OF THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS:</B> <I>Imad Tabsh</I>, COMPUSIM Inc., 1003D 55 Avenue N.E., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2E 6W1; Marc Dupuis, G&eacute;niSim, 3111 Alger, Jonqui&egrave;re. Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G7S 2M9
<P>
A comprehensive program (ARC/Dynamic) was developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of aluminium reduction cells during operation. The program uses the mass and energy balance equations to determine the transient evolution of more than 60 process variables. In addition, it simulates various operational and control policies in use during cell operation. This paper describes the use of ARC/Dynamic to study the sensitivity of the cell response to variations in the input parameters. It also looks at the cell performance under various amperage curtailment conditions such as sudden shutdown of the line or scheduled reduction in line amperage. A detailed description of the amperage fluctuation model implemented in the program is presented.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF CURRENT DISTRIBUTION AND ANODE SHAPE IN PREBAKE ALUMINIUM CELLS</B>: J. Zoric, I. Rousar, Department of Inorganic Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, 16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic; <I>J. Thonstad,</I> Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Two approaches were used to determine the current distribution in aluminium cells with prebaked anodes, i.e., primary and secondary current distribution, the latter giving far more realistic results. Current densities obtained for secondary current distribution were used to model the changes in anode shape from the time when a new anode has been set until it achieves the typical rounded off steady state profile. Mathematical modelling of the anode consumption using current densities obtained by the solution of the Laplace equation in 2D space, showed that a constant shape was reached after 6 - 8.6 days, depending on the width of the gap to a neighbouring anode or to the sidewall/sideledge. The calculated steady state shapes were similar to the shapes of anodes taken out of a cell. The current density decreases up along the side of the anode from the nominal value at the underside (0.75 A cm-2) to a minimum near the surface of the electrolyte (0.08 - 0.28 A cm-2), depending on the geometry. The percentage of the current which passes through the sides of the anodes is of the order of 15%. The current density on the anode side facing the periferic channel increases with increasing distance to the sideledge, while the exact shape of the ledge makes little difference. The cathodic current density in the periferic channel goes down to 0.07 A cm-2 for a 30 cm wide channel.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR COKE BED PREHEATING OF ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELL: </B><I>Shaher A. Mohammed,</I> R&amp;D Dept., Aluminium Company of Egypt, Nagi-Hammadi, Egypt; Maher M. Abdulwahab, Attia A. Arif, Omar M. Dahab, Power and Energy Dept., Minya University, Egypt
<P>
Many methods are available to preheat and bake-out the cathodes of aluminium reduction cells but only few of them are widely used. Resistor coke bed with shunt rheostat is one of the most common methods to preheat the cell. To get optimum design parameters for resistance elements and preheating method, a finite element model was built to simulate the process. The effect of starting current, coke bed thickness, rate of increase of current and finally total time needed for preheating, were studied. The obtained results indicated that the practical technique used has to be subjected to some modifications in order to reach satisfactory conditions.

HIERARCHICAL INTELLIGENT CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ALUMINUM REDUCTION CELLS</B>: <I>Jie Li</I>, Yexiang Liu, Jin Xiao, Department of Metallurgy, Central South University of Technology, Changsha, Hunan 410083, China; Feng Wang, <I>Shengwen Shi</I>, Department of Technology, Liancheng Aluminum Plant, Lanzhou, Gansu 730335, China
<P>
A hierarchical intelligent control system for aluminium reduction cells has been developed. There are two intelligent levels in the system. The higher level built on the principle of neural network expert system, aims at analyzing medium and long-term change trends of the state of the process, calculating settings for the lower level, interacting with operators and offering operation proposals. The lower level, composed of several subsystems which are set up on the principle of fuzzy control and expert control, is used to realize short-term analyses and real-time control of the process. As the system has a hierarchical and modular structure, its design, realization and testing are simplified. Test-run results verified that, combined together in one system, the controllers have good properties of robustness and adaptability with respect to changes of operating conditions and severe disturbances.

DETERMINATION OF METAL CURVATURE AND IMPROVED ANODE CONSUMPTION</B>: Jon H. Stefansson, Electrolysis Department, Icelandic Aluminium Co. Ltd., IS-222 Hafnarfj&ouml;rdur, Iceland; <I>Ren&eacute; von Kaenel,</I> Jacques Antille, Technology Center Chippis, Alusuisse Technology &amp; Management Ltd., CH-3965 Chippis, Switzerland
<P>
The Alusuisse ISAL smelter in Iceland does not have an in house anode plant. This makes it increasingly important to operate with small and evenly thick anode butts. Since the insertion height is calculated according to the carbon burning rate, it is important to know the difference in metal level according to the position in the pots. Two methods have been used to determine the metal upheaval. The first consists in measuring the height of many enough anode butts since the lower anode level adjusts to the metal level with time. The second method is based on mathematical modelling. Measured values have been compared to calculated values with good agreement. Insertion of the anodes according to metal level has resulted in improved gross anode consumption due to more even butt thickness and stable operation.

<P>
Various stability criteria are introduced and thermo-kinetic models for metallurgical processes are used as concrete examples for evaluation. Kinetic criteria for the process of dynamic recrystallization are proposed. These criteria are compared to the non-equilibrium thermodynamic approaches discussed in the literature. The application of macroscopic stability criteria to materials processing is then discussed.

<P>
Complex interfaces can be described as a distribution of interfacial patches, each having a differential area. The patches are fully characterized by a mean curvature, a dimensionless shape factor, and an extensive variable such as solid angle or area. Using this approach, a statistical theory of Ostwald ripening has been extended to describe the diffusion-limited coarsening of non-spherical convex interfaces. Coarsening rate constants are calculated as a function of both the precipitate volume fraction and the geometric shape factor. Application of these results to ripening of ellipsoidal precipitates and other morphologies will be discussed.

<P>ULTRA FINE PRECIPITATES IN REACTOR PRESSURE VESSEL STEELS INVESTIGATED BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS:  STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND MORPHOLOGY:</B> <I>C.L. Liu</I>, G.R. Odette, B.D. Wirth, and G.E. Lucas, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106
<P>
Ultra fine scale precipitates are the leading cause to the irradiation embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels and may limit the continued operation or extended life of a number of nuclear power plants around the world. Tremendous effort in studying these precipitates has been made using various experimental techniques such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and atom probe field ion microscope (APFIM). However, detailed identity and characteristic of the precipitates o atomic scale are not well known. We propose a self-consistent model, combining advanced thermodynamics, small angle neutron scattering measurements, and Lattice Monte Carlo simulations, to examine detailed identity and characteristic of the ultra fine precipitates on atomic scale in Fe-based multicomponent systems Fe-Cu-Ni-Mn and Fe-Cu-Ni-Mn-Si. A systematic parametric study using both the metallurgical and simulation variables is carried out. Interaction parameters in an extended regular solution treatment, composition, and temperature as the metallurgical variables, and starting configurations, sizes of simulation cells, and simulation duration as the simulation variables, are exercised. The results from the simulations are in good agreement with those from SANS and APFIM.

<P>OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION OF MARANGONI CONVECTION INDUCED THERMALLY IN A MOLTEN SALT:</B> T. Takasu, <I>J.M.

Nakamura, Dept of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Secsui-cho 1-1, Tobata-ku, Kitakyushu, 804 Japan
<P>
Marangoni convection has a large effect on materials processing since it remarkably promotes heat and mass transport near the free interface. In order to clarify the behavior of marangoni convection in a molten salt, observation and calculation of the thermal convection in a column held between a pair of Pt disks (2mm in diameter) which were fixed to hot thermocouples, were carried out. Calculated flow patterns and absolute values of fluid velocity agreed well with the observed results. When the temperatures of both disks were set equal and the height of liquid bridge was 2.4mm, four vortexes were generated on the longitudinal plane and typical velocity was 15mm/s. From the calculated isothermal lines the behavior of promotion of heat transport is obvious; fluid heated at the disks was conveyed to the free surface and fluid cooled at the surface was conveyed to the inner region. Increase in the height of column and/or increase in the absolute value of applied temperature difference lead to increase in fluid velocity lineally in this calculation range.

<P>MIXING PHENOMENA PERTINENT TO FERROALLOY REFINING USING WATER MODELS:</B> G. Akdogan, <I>R.H. Eric</I>, School of Process and Materials Engineering, University of the Witwatersraind, Johannesburg, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050 South Africa
<P>
Mixing phenomena in a bottom blown air-stirred one-seventh water model of CLU (Creusot-Loire Uddeholm) reactor was studied using three different configurations of straight circular nozzles fitted axially at the bottom of the vessel. The mixing time has been experimentally determined utilizing acid injection and pH measurements at various gas flow rates, bath heights and nozzle orientations in the presence and in the absence of a second phase. High air flow rates were utilized usually above the range of ordinary flow meters. During experiments the air flow rates varied from 0.00599m3/sec to 0.01465m3/sec. An integral orifice plate assembly, which is coupled to two pressure transmitters, was constructed to calculate gas flow rates from pressure readings. Experimental results reveal that the mixing time decreases with increasing gas flow rate. A critical gas flow rate exists after which the mixing time tends to increase for all tuyere configurations studied. For a given gas flow rate the mixing time increases non-linearly with increasing bath height. Off-center configuration gives slightly lower mixing times as compared to center configuration. The presence of an upper oil layer increases the mixing time significantly for all configurations showing its resistance to the recirculatory velocity of fluid near the surface of the bath. Under the very high flow rates employed in this investigation, it is found that the contribution of buoyancy to the total stirring energy density is very small, but its contribution increases with increasing bath height.

<P>DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS FOR PREDICTING THE STRESSES IN FORGING:</B> <I>T. Robert N</I>., Congreso 128-A204, Col. La Joya, Del. Tlalpan, Mexico, D.F., 14090; J. Navarrete M., J. Ramirez V., G. Salas B., M. Noguez A., Departamento de Ing. Metalurgica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Nal. Autonoma de Mexico, Cuidad Universitaria, 04510 Mexico, D.F.
<P>
The stresses required in an axial closed die forging are determined by the geometry of the blank and that of the die, the yield stress of the working material and the process variables like temperature, strain, strain rate, friction, etc. Five adimensional groups of the mentioned parameters are proposed. Like the Reynolds number, they permit the characterization and evaluation of almost any axial forging process. A wide data base is experimentally obtained, which validates the model. This dimensional analysis is an alternative to the traditional methods for calculating the stresses in metal forming.

<P>MODELING OF LIQUIDUS TEMPERATURE AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF MANGANESE SMELTING SLAGS BY THE USE OF NEURAL NETS: </B>M.A. Reuter, Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, <I>R H. Eric, </I>A.A. Hejja, School of Process and Materials Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Private Bag 3, WITS 2050, South Africa
<P>
Liquidus temperature and electrical conductivity data measured on synthetic slags were modeled by the use of neural nets(NN). In this work the applied multilayer feedforward NNs were trained by a conjugate-gradient optimization for which a three layer formulation was used. Very good fits were obtained for both the liquidus temperature and the conductivity data. The synthetic slags were prepared from pure oxides to represent a wide range of compositions likely to be encountered in ferromanganese and silicomanganese smelting. The slag constituents were in the following range: MnO, 5-30%; CaO, 20-35%; MgO, 5-15%; SiO2, 27-58%; and Al2O3, 5%. Liquidus temperatures varied from 1300&#176;C to 1380&#176;C and increased with increasing basicity ratio. The electrical resistivity of slags decreased with the increase of basicity ratio from 0.55 to 1.1 but above 1.1 basicity ratio the resistivity tended to increase depending upon the MnO content.

<P>MODELING OF SOLIDIFICATION AND VELOCITY OF ATOMIZED MOLTEN DROPLET DURING ATOMIZATION AND SPRAY FORMING:</B> Y.H. Su, <I>C.-Y. A. Tsao</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, China
<P>
A mathematical model to describe the solidification behaviors of atomized droplets during flight, in terms of nucleation temperature, recalescence temperature, nucleation position, solid fraction at nucleation temperature, and droplet temperature and velocity, is formulated. The concept of transient nucleation is applied to model such short nucleation event. A maximum droplet velocity exists, beyond which droplet velocity shows an inflection phenomenon during the flight. For shorter flight distance, smaller droplet is faster to reach a given flight distance; however, for longer flight distance, the situation is reversed. Variations of the gas flow patterns have more effects on smaller droplet, and the effects are more significant at longer flight distance. A minimum surface heat transfer coefficient exists as the droplet flies. Prior to nucleation or recalescence, smaller droplet has lower temperature at a given flight distance, and has lower nucleation temperature. Medium size droplet flies over the shortest flight distance before the nucleation starts. Smaller droplet has larger solid fraction at the end of recalescence. Atomization gas has more effects on droplet momentum than on the heat content of the droplet.

<P>THE EFFECT OF FORCED COOLING A PERMANENT COMPOSITE MOLD ON AIR GAP FORMATION: </B><I>D.R. Gunasegaram</I>1, D. Celentano2, T.T.

<P>
It is well known that the air gap that forms between casting and mold during the solidification process of an aluminum alloy substantially alters the rate of heat transfer at this interface. This paper reports studies on the effect of force cooling a composite permanent mold on the initiation and growth of the air gap. Interesting comparisons are made with the case where no forced cooling is employed. The two experiments are simulated using a fully coupled thermo-mechanical model called VULCAN, a finite element code, and its temperature and displacement predictions are validated. The air gaps are measured using LVDTs. The alloy used is A356, and the mold comprises H13 steel and beryllium-copper. Air jets are used to force cool the mold component surrounding an isolated thick section of the casting. The inverse heat conduction problem is solved in order to obtain boundary conditions for VULCAN.

<P>EFFECT OF TRANSVERSE DEPRESSIONS AND OSCILLATION MARKS ON HEAT TRANSFER IN THE CONTINUOUS CASTING MOLD:</B> <I>B.G. Thomas</I>, D. Lui, B. Ho, G. Li, Y. Shang, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 West Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
<P>Results from mathematical models and plant experiments are combined to quantify the effect of transverse depressions and oscillation marks on heat transfer in the continuous casting mold. A heat transfer model has been developed to calculate transient heat conduction within the solidifying steel, coupled with the steady-state heat conduction with the continuous casting mold wall. The model features a detailed treatment of the interfacial gap between the shell and mold, including mass and momentum balances on the solid and liquid powder layers. The model predicts the solidified shell thickness down the mold, temperature in the mold and shell, thickness of the resolidified and liquid powder layers, heat flux distribution down the mold, mold water temperature rise, ideal taper of the mold walls, and other related phenomena. The important effect of non-uniform distribution of superheat is incorporated using the results from previous 3-D turbulent fluid flow calculations within the liquid cavity. Results from plant experiments confirm that transverse surface depressions and oscillation marks form at the meniscus and move down the mold. Measurements of mold thermocouple temperatures and breakout shell thickness were used to calibrate the models. The predicted local surface temperature fluctuations were consistent with transient mold temperature measurements. The results indicate that the surface depressions and oscillation marks are filled with mold flux, but still have a significant effect on decreasing heat transfer, especially locally. Insights are gained into the formation of associated surface cracks and breakouts.

Rodriguez, A. Valles, C.V.G SIDOR, Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, <I>M. Rao</I>, Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana, Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela
<P>
<P>This paper shows a mathematical model based on finite elements, applied to bottom cast ingots of C.V.G Sidor Plant. The model was used as a strategy to determine the thermal effects that are produced when the solidification conditions are modified, without interfering with the production process. The modification consisted of placing a thermal insulant on top of mould. The results obtained by the model indicated that the solidification time increases with insulant on top of the mould. With these results a significant number of casts were run with and without insulant. Later by means of a metallurgical analysis it was determined that the ingots cast with insulant reduce the level of nonmetallic inclusions and the presence of internal blistering in seamless pipes.

USE OF IMAGING PYROMETRY SENSOR IN METALLURGICAL PROCESSES:</B> <I>C. Lorenson</I>, Quadtek, 14737 NE 87th St., Redmond, WA 98052<P>
The Spyrometer imaging pyrometer brings a new dimension of imaging capabilities to temperature measurement technology by combining a high temperature video camera with scanning optical pyrometry. This gives operators the ability to observe process conditions while measuring the temperature of virtually any object or region in the field of view. Since the lens tube of the camera can be air or water cooled, it is possible to insert the optical lens tube inside furnaces giving very good view of many different types of metallurgical processes. Specific benefits in process knowledge and maintenance tasks for electric arc melting furnaces, anode furnace and casting wheels, flash smelters, reheat furnaces, and torpedo ladles in different types of metal industries will be discussed.

A COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SENSOR FOR SOLIDIFICATION IN METAL CASTING:</B> J. Chun, N. Saka, <I>M.H. Hytros</I>, D. Kim, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, R.C. Lanza, I.M. Jureidini, Dept of Nuclear Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139<P>
We have developed a novel method, using X-ray photons and computed tomography (CT), for distinguishing the solidification front in metal casting processes directly and nondestructively. Depending on the metal, the density of the liquid and solid phases may differ anywhere from 4 to 12%. Computed tomography provides an excellent means of mapping this density difference into a two- or three-dimensional image. Using a Co60 radioisotope and a NaI scintillation detector, CT image reconstruction was performed on pure tin metal in a two-phase state. In addition, CT image reconstruction was done using a 6 MeV linear accelerator and CdWO4 scintillation detector array on pure and alloyed aluminum metals while they underwent solidification. As the speed of the data acquisition and image reconstruction improves, this sensor technology offers the possibility of real-time performance and eventual feedback control for the metal casting process.

LASER ULTRASONIC SENSING OF SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACES DURING BRIDGMAN SINGLE CRYSTAL GROWTH:</B> <I>H.N.G. Wadley</I>, Y. Lu, D.T. Queheillalt, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
Using a 3-D ray tracing methodology combined with laser ultrasonically measured elastic constant data near the melting point, ultrasonic propagation in cylindrical single crystal bodies containing either a convex or a concave solid-liquid interface have been simulated and used to design new sensing concepts. Ray paths, wavefronts, and time of flight (TOF) of rays that travel from a source to an arbitrarily positioned receiver have been calculated. Experimentally measured TOF data have been collected using laser generated/detected ultrasound on model systems with independently known interface shapes. Both numerically simulated data and experimental results have shown that the solidification (interfacial) region can be identified from ultrasonic transmission TOF data. Ultrasonic sensing in the diametral plane is the preferred sensing configuration. Since convex and concave solid-liquid interfaces result in distinctively different TOF data profiles, the interface shape (convex or concave) can be readily determined from the TOF data. When TOF data collected in the diametral plane are used in a nonlinear least squares algorithm, the interface curvature has been successfully reconstructed and ultrasonic velocities of both the solid and liquid obtained, the reconstruction errors were found to be less than 5%.

EDDY CURRENT SENSORS FOR MONITORING THE NUCLEATION AND GROWTH OF Cd0.96Zn0.04Te BULK CRYSTALS:</B> Haydn N.G. Wadley, <I>K.P. Dharmasena</I>, Bill W. Choi, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
Non-contact eddy current sensing methods have been developed and applied to Cd0.96Zn0.04Te crystal growth to obtain a better understanding of the melt, solid nucleation, and the growth process. The application of this sensor approach relies on a large difference in liquid and solid electrical conductivities near the melting point and requires knowledge of the relationships between the electrical conductivity, melt composition, and temperature. Using a multi-frequency encircling eddy current sensor, the electrical conductivities of three different Cd1-yZnyTe (y = 0.00, 0.045, and 0.08) alloys were measured as a function of temperature in a laboratory-scale vertical Bridgman furnace. The measured solid and liquid electrical conductivities were then used in electro-magnetic finite element models to analyze the multifrequency responses of eddy current sensor designs during the simulated growth of a crystal. Three eddy current sensors were fabricated and installed in a vertical Bridgman furnace and used to monitor many Cd0.96Zn0.04Te growth runs One sensor was placed in the vicinity of the ampoule tip to detect undercooling/spontaneous nucleation and two other sensors (&quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;differential&quot; designs) placed to monitor the movement/curvature of the liquid-solid interface during crystal growth. The sensor data was used to characterize the initial melt state, detect the onset of nucleation, determine the growth velocity, and identify the shape of the interface.

ADVANCES IN SENSING COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR CRYSTAL GROWTH:</B> <I>J.P. Wallace</I>, Casting Analysis Corp., RT 2 BOX 113, Weyers Cave, VA 24486<P>
Monitoring compound semiconductor crystal growth using multifrequency eddy currents for sensing illustrates some of the extreme problems of measurement and interpretation of that are not often seen in metallic systems monitored through solidification. Using sensor arrays and scanning have produced a qualitative and quantitative basis for understanding some of the high temperature electrical conductivity mechanisms. The implications of these measurements of electrical conductivity variations are important in that they reflect the complex states of stress that will occur on cooling and heat treating following crystal growth. In particular, for the CdTe and the CdZnTe system, the measurements provide some proof of where the changes in majority defect types occur. The complex nature of the melt and the cooling solid coupled with the growth interface data provide a basis for analyzing the major events during growth and cool down.

GAUGING OF HOT TUBE, BAR, AND WELDS BY MULTIFREQUENCY EDDY CURRENT: </B> <I>J.P. Wallace</I>, Casting Analysis Corp., C. Iheagwara, Magnetic Analysis Corp., RT 2 Box 113, Weyers Cave, VA 24486<P>
Refinements in sensor design have produced low-cost rugged elements acting as loops coupled with stable detection hardware. This has allowed direct dimensional gauging of nonferrous and ferrous products above the curie point for absolute dimensions and electrical conductivities independently. The software was developed for the analysis of electrical conductivity profiles in CZ silicon crystal growth, then refined for the monitoring of bar properties, and then tube properties. Since in most metal working operations, speeds at the minimum of a few hundred feet per minute are encountered, the design of the gauge was optimized for a rapid measurement. Independently extracting electrical conductivity provides data in some metal system for determining the temperature of the monitored product. Applications in ferrous heat treatment will be discussed.

A REMOTELY OPERABLE SENSOR FOR PRECISION SURFACE MAPPING USING COHERENT FREQUENCY MODULATED (FM) LASER RADAR: </B> <I>M.M. Menon</I>, R.E. Barry, P.T. Spampinato, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6305; A. Slotwinski, Coleman Research Corporation, Springfield, VA 22150; M.A. Dagher, Rockwell International Corporation, Canoga Park, CA 91303<P>
A coherent FM laser radar based sensor is being developed for remote metrology of plasma facing material surfaces in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The sensor is capable of three-dimensional mapping of the surface under examination, based on a series of precise range measurements. Sub-millimeter accuracy at large ranges (15 m) has been achieved. Other features that are being incorporated include the ability to operate under adverse environmental conditions involving a combination of very high gamma radiation (3x106 rad/h), ultra-high-vacuum (&lt;10-7 torr), and high temperature (200&#176;C). The paper will describe the basic principles of the sensor, together with experimental results obtained with the sensor. The paper will also outline the broad capabilities of the sensor, including its ability for remote rendering of &quot;visual quality&quot; images without the need for any external illumination.

ELECTRONIC PROTOTYPING: TOWARDS VIRTUAL MATERIALS RESEARCH:</B> <I>S.R. LeClair</I>, Wright Laboratory, Materials Directorate, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7746; S.L. Thaler, PanAptics, Inc., 12906 Autumn View Dr., St. Louis, MO 63146-4331
<P>
The most significant first step toward electronic prototyping (EP) in the research community has been the pursuit of intelligent processing (i.e., closed-loop process control), effectively using in situ sensors to monitor both process parameters (energy input), material behavior (changes in bulk structure, temperature, etc.), and characterize materials at the atomic scale, wherein material properties such as strength, residual stresses, composition, phase, compressibility, modulus, etc., are monitored and controlled in real-time. Of interest are the identity of interrelationships between sensed variables which enable fault detection - discover and monitor, in real-time, an evolving taxonomy (a set of linear and other meaningful relationships) which can be classified as &quot;faults&quot;; process stability analysis - establish a measure of stability, in real-time, by assessing process response/noise in the context of energy input, apparatus actuation, and the control algorithm requisite variety; and response time - establish a measure of performance, in real-time, of &quot;sensor-actuator&quot; limits to affect specific processing requirements. Yet these capabilities are merely near-term - the more interesting, longer term capability is the pursuit of process discovery, i.e., how these relationships and measures might provide insight into explaining phenomena of interest and/or enable the development of a material or process model in situ.

ACCURATE, RELIABLE CONTROL OF PROCESS GASES BY MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS:</B> <I>J. Hardy, </I>T. McKnight, Instruments and Controls Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6003
<P>
The thermal mass flow controller, or MFC, has become an instrument of choice for the monitoring and controlling of process gas flow throughout the materials processing industry. MFCs are used on CVD processes, etching tools, and furnaces and in the semiconductor industry are used on 70% of the processing tools. Reliability and accuracy are major concerns for the users of MFCs. Calibration and characterization technologies have been developed and implemented for mass flow devices. A test facility is available to industry and universities to test and develop gas flow sensors and controllers and evaluate their performance related to environmental effects, reliability, reproducibility, and accuracy. Additional work has been conducted in the area of accuracy. A gravimetric calibrator was invented that allows flow sensors to be calibrated in corrosive, reactive gases to an accuracy of 0.3% of reading. This paper will present possible sources of error in MFC process gas flow monitoring and control, and will present an overview of corrective measures which may be implemented with MFC use to significantly reduce these sources of error.

MONOLITHIC MICRO-SPECTROMETER FOR LOW-COST LIQUID AND GASEOUS CONSTITUENT PROCESS MONITORING: </B><I>S. Rajic, </I>C.M. Egert, Engineering Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-8039
<P>
A monolithic miniature spectrometer suitable for a variety of sensing applications including industrial process monitoring has been developed. The device consists of a solid structure with a volume less than 6 cubic centimeters. All optical components of the spectrometer including two aspheric mirrors, a diffration grating, and entrance and exit surfaces are fabricated onto the surface of the structure. All light paths are internally contained within the structure. The result is a small, rugged spectroscopic sensor ideally suited for use as a process monitor. Due to its monolithic nature, the device requires no post-fabrication alignment; nor can it be knocked out of alignment during use. The prototype device discussed here was produced in PMMA by precision diamond turning; however, lower cost manufacturing approaches involving injection molding (using diamond turned molds) are under development to produce an affordable sensor. Due to its rugged monolithic design, small footprint, and low cost, the monolithic micro-spectrometer is ideally suited for distributed process monitoring applications often required for industrial processes. It is expected that specific sensor designs will be required for specific applications so as to maximize the performance and resolution over the operating range. The performance of this device as well as the design tradeoffs necessary to optimize performance for given applications will be discussed in the report.

TWO METHODS FOR EMBEDDING OPTICAL FIBERS IN METAL COMPONENTS: </B><I>L.J. Talarico</I>*, S.W. Allison1, C.A. Blue**, H.M. Meyer III***, L.

<P>
Manufacturing or embedding optical fiber sensors in composite materials such as graphite-epoxy, cementitious, plastic or ceramic components is of growing importance to a variety of smart materials and structures applications. A variety of fiber optic sensors can measure strain, pressure, and temperature by observing changes in an output signal fluorescence spectrum or a shift in output signal peak wavelength. The ability to measure these parameters on the surface of, as well as within, a part could provide experimental data for evaluating models, perhaps identifying some inferior parts on-line, and monitoring operating behavior. Some examples are monitoring cure and assessing thermal damage in polymer matrix composites by measuring changes in the epoxy fluorescence spectrum and monitoring densification during powder pressing. Other potential applications include engine diagnostics, condition based maintenance of aircraft and vehicle components, and monitoring and control in the metal forming and materials processing industries.

EXAMINATION ON THE USE OF ACOUSTIC EMISSION FOR MONITORING METAL FORGING PROCESS: A STUDY USING SIMULATION TECHNIQUE:</B> <I>W.M. Mullins</I>, TMC, Inc., WL/MLIM, WPAFB, OH 45433-7746; R.D. Irwin, Dept of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH; J.C. Malas III, S. Venugopal, Materials Process Design, Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433-7746
<P>
Physical models for acoustic emission (AE) are introduced and expressions are derived to predict AE activity from such parameters as applied stress, strain, and strain rate. These models are then incorporated into a visco-plastic finite-element simulation program, and the acoustic emission event rate generated during metal-forming operations are predicted. Simulation results are presented for upsetting operations on a typical C-Mn type steel for various friction and die geometry conditions. The AE model predictions compare well with the available experimental results reported in the literature and demonstrate that AE signatures can be reliably simulated. The signatures predicted for metal forging are fairly insensitive to changes in certain processing parameters. This suggests that AE event rate monitoring may not be well suited for monitoring changes in microstructure and friction during forging operations. Some very preliminary studies of event spectral analysis have been performed which show that AE spectral features may be sufficiently dependent on structure and loading to warrant further examination for application to monitoring metal-forging processes.

SHEAR MODE EMAT AS A SENSOR FOR COMPOSITE LAMINATE FABRICATION:</B> <I>David K. Hsu</I>, Center for Nondestructive Evaluation, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
The polarization direction of shear mode ultrasound interacts strongly with the fiber direction in a composite laminate. Using conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, we have shown that cross-polarized shear waves were effective for sensing ply orientation errors and ply sequence anomalies. In this paper, we extend the technique to use electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT), particularly for green (uncured) graphite epoxy composite laminates. Preliminary results will be shown and potential applications for quality control will be discussed.

MEASUREMENT OF GAS COMPOSITIONS USING SOLID ELECTROLYTES:</B> R.V. Kumar, <I>D.J. Fray</I>, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom
<P>
Sensors are required to measure gaseous species such as SOX, NOX, HCl, and water vapour at elevated temperatures. There are very few solid electrolytes which respond to these gases, and furthermore, the species are usually present with other gases to which the electrolyte may respond. In addition, for long periods of operation, a stable reference is required. In order to meet these challenges, sensors consisting of two electrolytes in intimate contact have been developed. To measure HCl, a proton-conducting electrolyte is interfaced with strontium chloride. The reaction for the cell: (-) Pt, Air + HCl(g))/SrCl2//SrCeO3 + 10 mole % Nd2O3// Air + HCl(g), Pt(+). At the various interfaces, the reactions are: anode: 2Cl- + SrHCl = SrCl2 + HCl(g) + 2e-interface: 2H+ + 2Cl- = 2HCl(interface) cathode: HCl(interface) + SrCl2 + 2e- = SrHCl + 2Cl- overall cell reaction: HCl(interface) = HCl(g). The net result is that the potential is independent of the oxygen potential of the gas and the reference is given by the interaction of the two electrolytes. There is no need for an external reference which overcomes the problems of forming gas thigh seals at elevated temperatures. Other examples of this approach for the measurement of SOX, NOX, CO2, and H2O will be given.

DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF OXYGEN SENSORS IN COPPER METALLURGY: </B> <I>S. Seetharaman</I>, Du Sichen, A. Jakobsson, Division of Theoretical Metallurgy, Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44 Stockholm, Sweden
<P>
Oxygen concentration cells with stabilized zirconia electrolytes are widely used today to measure the activity of oxygen in liquid metals. In the case of liquid copper, the activity of oxygen in the molten metal as well as the effect of a third element on the same have been extensively studied using galvanic cells of the type (-) Pt, W or cermet / Cu-O-M // ZrO2 (stabilized) // AO, A / Pt (+, where M is the third element in molten copper and AO / A represents a suitable oxide/metal reference electrode. The effect of a number of &quot;third elements&quot; like Mn, Zn, As, Se, and Te on the oxygen activity in liquid copper have been studied by this method. The Mn and Zn interact very strongly with oxygen in Cu ( ), while, in the case of arsenic, the interaction parameter is nearly zero. The behavior of Se and Te in liquid copper with respect to the effect on the activity of oxygen is unique. At oxygen levels of the order of 10-4, these elements lower the activity coefficient of oxygen in the melt, while, at lower oxygen levels, the interaction parameter values are positive. These results are discussed in the light of some of the theoretical models for solute interactions in liquid metals. The application of these sensors in flash smelting, converter, and casting sections of copper production are discussed along with their implications on process optimization.

APPLICATION OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY TO HIGH&#173;TEMPERATURE ANALYTICAL MEASUREMENTS. </B><I>J.P. Young</I>, S, Dai, Y. Lee, H. Xiao, Chemical and Analytical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831&#173;6142
<P>
There are numerous analytical applications of scatter&#173;emission and absorption spectroscopy to liquids and solids in the temperature range of 0&#176; to 350&#176;C; process control is made impossible by using fiberoptic probes and Raman spectroscopy, for example, in these measurements. We have developed a unique all&#173;silica fiberoptic probe which can have analytical applications in the temperature range where silica is a solid, 0&#176; to 1600&#176;C, and in chemical situations where it is inert. We have also developed techniques to use the ratio of the Stokes/anti&#173;Stokes Raman emission of diamond to measure temperature in the range of 400 to 1000&#176;C. We will discuss our results of such measurements in molten chloride and fluoride salts, other liquids, and solids. We will also describe our plans for temperature measurements by Raman spectroscopy through optical fibers in the range of 1000 to 2500&#176;C, a range that can include molten metals such as steel.

SOLID STATE CURRENT-POTENTIAL SWEEP SENSOR FOR THE IN-SITU MONITORING OF COMPOSITION AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES IN HIGH TEMPERATURE METALLURGICAL SLAGS:</B> S.C. Britten, V. Stancovski, <I>U. Pal</I>, Dept of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 4-134, Cambridge, MA 02139
<P>
An in-situ solid-state electrochemical technique for measuring the concentrations of easily dissociable oxides in slags at temperatures between 1200 to 1600&#176;C is being developed. The technique consists of using a stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte, which conducts oxygen ions, to separate a reference gas compartment from the slag of interest. Using a potentiostat, a direct current potential sweep is applied between the inner and outer compartments of the electrolyte, driving oxygen ions from the slag into a reference gas. With the use of open circuit reference electrodes, the resulting magnitude of the current potential profile reveals the concentration of dissociable oxides such as those of iron, manganese, and chromium. The open circuit potential recovery indicates the type of oxide present and its thermodynamic activity within the slag. The technique should therefore determine multiple properties of several different oxides with only one measurement. The limits imposed by the electronic short-circuit property of the zirconia electrolyte on the sensitivity of the technique are also under investigation.

APPLICATIONS OF SENSORS IN MOLTEN SALT TECHNOLOGY FOR METAL PROCESSING:</B> P.T. Velu, <I>R.G. Reddy</I>, Dept of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487
<P>
The use of emf measurements to derive classical thermochemical data has been in use for many years. The reaction associated with electrochemical process is harnessed in a galvanic cell and energy involved measured in terms of electromotive force. The property requirements of sensor electrodes used differ for various aqueous, molten salt, and solid electrolyte systems. The electrodes for molten salt electrolytes need special care for construction. This paper describes the studies carried using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This electrode was used to measure the solubility of compounds in molten salt electrolytes. The results obtained using this electrode are in excellent agreement with the values from chemical analysis method.

NOVEL SOLID STATE SENSOR FOR MEASURING ARSENIC IN MOLTEN METALS: </B> <I>G.M. Kale</I>, Dept of Mining and Mineral Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; D.J.

A novel solid state sensor for measuring arsenic dissolved in molten metals has been developed based on a novel solid electrolyte conducting K+ ions. The solid state sensor can be schematically represented as: (-)Mo, Zn-As/ /K-323 SE/ /K-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">Fe2O3+Fe2O3+02, Fe-Cr(+). The open circuit emf of the above sensor was measured in molten zinc containing less than 0.1 wt % As at a temperature of 823K. The emf of the sensor was found to vary linearly as a function of 1nXAs, where XAs is the mole fraction of As in An(1). The ionic conductivity of the novel solid electrolyte (K-323) was measured over a range of temperature (370&lt;T&lt;770K) using a vector impedance analyzer. The K+ ion conductivity of K-323 at 823K was found to be 1 X 10-3<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-omega.gif">-1cm-1. The performance of these arsenic sensors is currently being evaluated in plants in the United Kingdom and Germany.

MEASUREMENT OF NITROGEN AND SULPHUR IN MOLTEN METALS USING SOLID ELECTROLYTES:</B> Y.C. Avniel, T.E. Warner, <I>D.J. Fray</I>, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom
<P>
One of the major problems of the iron and steel industry is the presence of phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen, and silicon. Careful control and removal of these elements is required, and an on-line measurement of the concentration during removal would greatly improve the efficiency of the process. The oxygen content of molten metals is usually measured by using a sensor based upon stabilized zirconia, in which the oxygen ion is mobile. However, for nitrogen and sulphur, stable ionically conducting solid electrolytes for nitrogen and sulphur do not exist. The approach adopted in this work is to use electrolytes which conduct alkali and alkaline earth elements. For example, when a sodium ion conducting electrolyte is placed in a situation where sodium is not present, the sodium comes to equilibrium with the species which forms the most stable compound with sodium. Examples are given where sodium, strontium, and calcium beta alumina respond to sulphur and oxygen. Regions of response to a given species depend upon the concentration of other species in the melt and the standard free energy of formation of the various compounds. In the case of nitrogen measurement, it proved necessary to develop a new electrolyte, based upon rare earth oxides, in which nitrogen is soluble in the anion lattice. Results are presented for the measurement of sulphur and nitrogen partial pressures and for these species in molten iron and steel.

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS FOR CONTROL OF THIN FILM GROWTH:</B> <I>A.G. Jackson</I>, S.J.P. Laube, J. Jones, TMC, Inc., Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433<P>
Control of thin films during the growth process is dependent on several difficult-to-monitor parameters, including flux of film material, pressure, substrate temperature, composition, and thickness. One means for easing this difficulty is to take advantage of emission spectra associated with the process and the film. For pulsed laser deposition (PLD) the ion cloud generated by the laser has characteristic emission spectra that can be used to control the deposition. Raman spectroscopy affords the possibility of real-time control by sensing characteristic peaks associated with film composition and thickness. These spectroscopic methods offer a real-time alternative to process control that is very attractive because of the ability to accurately control films to achieve the engineered structures and properties sought. Examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of these methods for this film preparation.

RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY FOR DETERMINING YBCO THIN FILM PARAMETERS IN SITU:</B> David P. Lubbers, Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; John D. Busbee, <I>A.G. Jackson</I>, TMC, Inc., Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433; Rand R. Biggers, David C. Liptak, SOCHE, Dayton, OH<P>
This paper describes the application of Raman spectroscopy for characterizing superconducting YBCO thin film parameters. Attenuation of the substrate Raman spectrum as a function of material deposited is established. Also, a correlation between film quality and Raman spectrum is explored. The identification and discrimination of superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases of YBCO is presented. The critical temperature (Tc) of a film as a function of its oxygen content is also established using Raman peak ratios. These results provide significant implications toward the use of Raman spectroscopy for in situ monitoring and control of the PLD process. Film quality can be controlled via optimization of film oxygen content and reduction of improper YBCO phases. Film thickness can be controlled by monitoring the response of the substrate material. Also, the PLD process can be studied and modeled using this powerful observation tool.

INTELLIGENT PROCESSING OF MATERIALS: AN APPLICATION TO POLYMER COMPOSITES:</B> <I>J.F. Maguire, </I>M.A. Miller, Materials Development Dept., Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX<P>
The process control of polymeric components is a difficult problem in modern process control. These materials consist of a chemically reactive resin which impregnates a reinforcing fiber. The resin is subject to aging phenomena and is found that frequent adjustments of the process are needed in order to assure quality of the product. In order to increase quality and reduce manufacturing delays the manufacturing process was analyzed from a physico-chemical standpoint and intelligent control system was developed and implemented. It was determined that integration of a novel advanced sensor technology based on in situ Raman and Rayleigh light scattering with a state-of-the-art chemical kinetic and polymer transport model of the polymerization process would provide real (sensor) and virtual (model) information on which material process control decisions could be based. The sensor information provides chemical and physical analytic data in real-time. This data is analyzed and compared with the predictions of the model and adaptive control decisions are implemented. The control system was interfaced with customized processing hardware via a programmable logic controller (PLC) employing conventional ladder logic. The system has been tested extensively and has been able to process adaptively advanced composite components fabricated from quartz reinforced polyimides. Finally, the process logic control algorithms, which rely on the physical and chemical state of the material based on sensor information, are generic to any chemically reactive resin with minor modifications to initial parameter values.

ALUMINUM SENSOR FOR STEEL GALVANIZING BATHS:</B> <I>R.Sridhar, </I>J.M. Toguri, Dept. of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M4S 3E4, Canada<P>
The aluminum content of zinc galvanizing baths is an important parameter for producing good quality steel sheets for automotive applications. The present method of bath sampling and chemical analysis measures the total aluminum content of the bath which includes dissolved aluminum and aluminum in entrained dross. Also, this method does not provide quick analysis for process control purposes. It has been reported that the measurement of dissolved aluminum is essential to obtain a good zinc coating on steel. Laboratory experiments have shown that an electrochemical cell consisting of an aluminum electrode, an ionic fused salt and an electrode like Mo (inert to Zn) dipping in the zinc bath has good potential for quick dissolved aluminum measurements. Such a sensor can be ready adopted for process control. These results will be discussed.

SOLID-STATE ALUMINUM SENSOR FOR USE IN MOLTEN ZINC:</B> <I>J.W. Fergus, </I>S. Hui, Materials Research and Education Center, 201 Ross Hall, Auburn University, AL 36849<P>
Aluminum is an important alloying addition to the zinc used in the hot-dip galvanization of sheet steel to control the properties and appearance of the resulting coating. Optimization of the galvanization process requires control of the alloy concentration, which can be improved through the use of chemical sensors. Aluminum sensors, based on molten electrolytes, are commercially available but are not widely used because of their high cost. One approach to reducing the cost is to use a solid electrolyte, which can simplify the sensor design and, thus, reduce the cost of fabrication. In this paper, the development of an aluminum sensor based on a solid fluoride electrolyte, specifically magnesium fluoride, will be described.

APPLICATIONS OF Al SENSORS IN CONTINUOUS GALVANIZING:</B> N. Qiang, <I>N.-Y. Tang</I>, G.R. Adams, Cominco Ltd., Product Technology Centre, Sheridan Science and Technology Park, Mississauga, Ontario L5K 1B4 Canada<P>
Aluminum is the most important alloy addition to Zn baths for controlling the reaction kinetics between the steel substrate and molten Zn in continuous galvanizing operations. The control of effective bath Al content is particularly critical for galvannealing where a high bath Al content may lead to incomplete alloying during postannealing, and a low bath Al content may result in other problems, such as an excessive bottom dross accumulation and difficulties in coating thickness control. The amount of Al in a galvanized coating has a strong influence on coating properties and the overall product quality. Yet, due to the complexity of the Zn-Fe-Al ternary system, the measurement and accurate of Al sensors has made the real-time measurements of bath Al contents possible. To facilitate their application, a computer interface and a palm-size data logger have been developed. Plant applications indicated that the sensor possessed sufficient accuracy for process monitoring and control. Potential benefits of Al sensor applications include improvements in process control and product quality, reductions in product transition periods for dual product lines, and a reduction in the overall production cost.

<P>EFFECTS OF FLUID VELOCITY OF ELECTROLYTE ON COPPER ELECTROREFINING:</B> A. Tsubouchi, T. Nakamura, F. Noguchi, I. Iakasu, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kitakyushu, Japan 804
<P>
A high current density operation is desired to improve the productivity in copper electrorefining. However, a lot of problems still remain such as passivation of anode, dendritic deposition of cathode and contamination of impurity elements during the high current density electrorefining of copper. To clear the problems mentioned above, effects of the fluid velocity of the electrolyte on the morphology of copper deposition on cathode and the passivation behaviour of anode have been investigated at various current densities in the present study. Although a granular appearance of the copper deposition was obtained with increasing the current density, it was depressed by an increase of the fluid velocity of the electrolyte. Then an uniform deposition on the cathode was also observed when the fluid velocity of it became higher. Further more, no passivation behaviour of anode could be found by high speed circulating the electrolyte even in the high current density operation.

<P>ENERGY SAVING IN COPPER ELECTROWINNING:</B> C. Lupi, D. Pilone, Dip. ICMMPM, Universit&agrave; di Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;, V. Eudossiana, 18, 00184 Roma, Italy
<P>
The energy consumption, in the electrowinning step of copper production by hydrometallurgical traditional process, generally represents more than 1/4 of the total energy requirement. The considerable saving can be achieved just in this step that requires about 8 GJ/tonne of the produced copper. To save energy the cell voltage, or more appropriately its anodic component, can be reduced: that is because the anodic voltage represents the main component of cell voltage and so it is responsible for the actual energy consumption in the copper sulphate electrowinning. In this work some ways are studied to lower the anodic voltage. First the cobalt ions were added to the sulphate solution in order to study the catalytic effect on oxygen discharge. Then lead alloys anodes (Pb-Ag, Pb-Sb-Ag and Pb-Ca) were used to promote a better oxygen evolution as a result of a different anodic surface. Their behaviour was compared with the Pb-Sb traditional ones. Finally, as already pointed out by several authors for zinc electrowinning, ethylene glycol was employed as anodic depolarizer in order to verify its effectiveness in the case of copper electrowinning. Combining all the above-mentioned ways energy saving ranging from 20% to 27% is achieved. All the tests were carried out on a laboratory pilot-plant for long time to simulate the industrial conditions. The obtained copper deposits were observed by SEM to highlight their morphology and were also analyzed by spectrometer to verify their purity.

<P>
The fluid flow in a copper refining cell is calculated three 
dimensionally, using the CFD-software package FIRE. The simulation is based on 
density variations in the boundary layer at the electrode surface. Calculations 
and LDA-measurements are in good correspondence. The actual glue 
concentration in the cell is calculated, too. Moreover, a two phase flow approach 
is developed, based on the &quot;Discrete Droplet Model&quot; to simulate the 
behaviour of anode slime during electrolysis. The position, velocity and diameter 
of each anode slime particle is described. The computations show the 
dependence of slime particle size distribution, density and electrolyte 
circulation rate on the possibility of being included in the cathode copper or collected 
at the cell bottom.

<P>INFLUENCE OF THE ELECTROCRYSTALLIZATION INHIBITORS DURING COPPER ELECTROREFINING: A NEW 
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH:</B> J.-L. Delplancke, M. Degrez, C. Temmerman, R. Winand, Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, Metallurgy, CP165, 50 Av. F.D. Roosevelt, B1050 Brussels, Belgium
<P>
The influence of the copper electrocrystallization inhibitors (mainly 
thiourea, gelatin and chloride ions) is studied in a new fully automatic pilot plan. 
This paper describes the conception and the building of this plan. The plan is 
in hydrodynamic similitude with an industrial copper electrorefining plan. 
Three cells with forced electrolyte flow may be connected in parallel or in series 
on order to model the copper production cells. The electrolyte is 
characterized chemically and electrochemically before and after electrolysis. One day 
and one week long experiments are performed. The structure of the deposits 
is characterized by SEM, EDX and metallographic cross-sections. The 
new approach for the study of these inhibitors is firstly to reproduce the 
experimental conditions observed in the industry with the three additives 
present simultaneously in the electrolyte and secondly to study the influence of 
a slight modification of the concentration of one inhibitor, the others 
being present in the electrolyte with their industrial nominal concentrations.

<P>THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PASSIVATING FILMS ON COMMERCIAL COPPER ANODES USING IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY:</B> M.S. Moats, J.B. Hiskey, S.C. Campin, University of Arizona, Copper Research Center, Material Science and Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Mines, Tucson, AZ
<P>
Electrochemical techniques are a valuable means of analyzing the passivation of commercial copper anodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provides information concerning transport and reaction phenomena occurring at an electrode surface. Commercial copper anodes of varying compositions have been examined using EIS. Experiments were conducted in a flat cell with an electrolyte of 40 g/l Cu2+ and 160 g/l H2SP4 maintained at 65&#176;C. Impedance spectra were obtained at the potentials characteristic of the open circuit voltage and the passive region for each anode. The spectra of the passivating films exhibited a flattened resistive/capacitive loop at middle to high frequencies and an inductive loop at low frequencies. An equivalent circuit utilizing an inductor-resistor series in parallel with the double layer capacitance and charge transfer resistance was adequate in modeling the impedance data. The influence of anodes impurities on the components of the equivalent circuit is discussed and correlated with a <I>bilayer passivation</I> model.

<P>SURFACE ROUGHENING OF ELECTROWON COPPER IN THE PRESENCE OF CHLORIDE IONS:</B> E. Ilgar, P. Yu, T.J. O'Keefe, University of Missouri-Rolla, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Graduate Center for Materials Research, Rolla, MO 65409-1170
<P>
A statistically designed screening test was carried out in the absence and presence of 20 ppm Cl- ions using a three factor, two-level factorial design in an electrolyte containing 36 gl-1 Cu2+ and 150 gl-1 sulfuric acid. The independent variables evaluated were agitation, current density and temperature; their influence on surface roughness was determined. Using the data generated, a model expression was developed to allow estimation of surface roughness of the copper deposits. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and profilometer techniques were used in the evaluation. The copper deposited at current densities where activation was the primary control mechanism appeared similar in morphology whether stirring was used or not. The addition of 20 ppm Cl- ions to the electrolyte gave rougher deposits under the same conditions. In the mixed control regions, where mass transfer effects were initiated, considerably rougher and more dendritic deposits were obtained when Cl- ions were present. Agitation was effective in reducing the copper surface roughness both in the apparent activation and mixed control regions in the presence of Cl- ions. The results of this study showed that 20 ppm Cl- polarized the copper deposition at low overpotentials but caused depolarization at higher overpotentials, and promoted roughening even where Cu2+ mass transfer was not a factor.

<P>THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATION OF CURRENT DISTRIBUTION IN ELECTRODEPOSITION OF COPPER:</B> Y.S. Choi, N.S. Kim, S.H. Jeon, T. Kang, Seoul National University, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Seoul, Korea; H.J. Sohn, Seoul National University, Department of Mineral and Petroleum Engineering, Seoul, Korea<P>

The thickness uniformity of electrodeposits depends largely on the current density distribution over the cathode. The current distribution is determined by the geometrical characteristics of the electrodes and the cell, the polarization at the electrode surface and the mass transfer in the electrolyte. The calculation of the current distribution is possible by various numerical techniques, among which the boundary element method (BEM) is considered to be most efficient. In this study the program for the calculation of 3-dimensional current distribution by use of the BEM with a linear element of trigonal type was developed and applied to the rectangular cathodes in copper electroplating. For simplicity the anode potential was assumed to be constant and the nonlinear polarization curves obtained from the potentiodynamic experiments were fitted to a linear equation over the range of current densities, 20~80mA/cm2. The effect of the cell dimension and the anode shape on current distribution was simulated. The calculated values agreed fairly well with the measured values and the thickness uniformity could be improved by the proper combination of the cell geometry and the anode shape.

<P>THE SOUTHERN PERU ILO REFINERY, DESIGN FEATURES, OPERATION AND IMPROVEMENT:</B> F. Begazo, W.A. Enrico, Southern Peru Limited, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, NY 10038
<P>
Southern Peru Limited's Ilo Refinery, the largest in Peru, began operations in 1975 with a production capacity of 165,000 stpy. Southern Peru bought the Refinery from the state owned Minero Peru S.A. on June 1, 1994. The refinery processes blister from Southern Peru's Ilo smelter. Blister copper is processed in an anode plant equipped with two 365 st. tilting reverberatory furnaces, a 26 mold casting wheel and an anode press machine. Copper is electrorefined in a tank house equipped with 768 commercial cells, 44 stripper cells and 40 liberator cells, utilizing two electrolyte circuits and a 21,000 ampere rectifier. During 1989 through 1994, a program for improving productivity was carried out by increasing the number of cells and increasing current density to the total rectifier capacity. As a result, a capacity of 215,000 stpy of refined copper, 2 million troy ounces of silver and 6,000 troy ounces of gold per year was achieved. In 1994, Southern Peru announced plans to increase the capacity to 250,000 stpy of cathode with a US$ 18 million investment and a US$2 million investment in environmental improvement projects, as part of the purchase agreement with the Peruvian government. This paper outlines the scope of the Southern Peru Limited refinery modernization and environmental program. It describes the implementation of the electrolytic plant expansion based on installation of polymer concrete cells, a new rectifier, a new selenium roaster and a precious metal plant upgrades.

<P>DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATIC MATERIAL HANDLING AND MONITORING SYSTEMS IN AN EXISTING ELECTROLYTIC ZINC PLAN:</B> T. Yamada, R. Togashi, T. Aichi, Akita Zinc Co., Ltd., Hjima Refinery, Akita, Japan
<P>
<P>Mainly due to the strong yen and the relatively low metal price, the zinc refineries in Japan are being forced to reduce man power. At IIjima, a new automatic material - handling system for cathode transportation was developed and the first system went to service in August 1994. The work was started in 1993 and all installation will be finished in the summer 1997. The critical part of this work was to achieve the designed cycle time because of the fairly complex cell-layout. As the cathodes are placed opposite direction in every other unit, cranks must be able to move toward two directions (X and Y) at the same time and to stop precisely at the tolerance level of a few millimeter. The central monitoring system for machine operation run by an original application software with MICROSOFT EXCEL&#169; on WINDOWS 95&#169;, was started in June 1996. There had been one person only for operating a manual crane before. Now an operator of a stripping machine can control the automatic crane for the same row at the same time. As a result, only one person can operate both a crank and a stripping machine for one row. And more labour saving is expected in the future.

<P>INDUSTRIAL SIZE &quot;PLACID ELECTROWINNING CELL&quot;: </B> C.Fr&iacute;as, M.A. Garc&iacute;a, G. D&iacute;az, Tecnicas Reunidas, S.A., R &amp; D Centre, Madrid, Spain
<P>
Under the auspicious of the Commission of the European Union, a consortium composed of six European organizations has developed the PLACID process, into the Brite Euram II Programme. The project began on January 1993 and was finished on April 1996. The PLACID process is based on a novel technology able to deal with different lead bearing materials, mainly lead oxide secondaries: Lead-acid batter pastes, lead fumes, furnace slags, oxide residues, etc., producing &quot;four nines&quot; pure lead in an efficient manner with a benign influence on the environment. In the PLACID process, lead is leached in warm, slightly acidic, brine to form soluble lead chloride. This solution is purified by cementation with lead powder. Pure lead is then won from the lead chloride electrolyte on the cathode of the electrowinning cell and is collected. This electrolytic cell is the heart of the process and it was especially developed to give optimum performance. Hydrochloric acid is reformed in the cell and returned to the leaching bath; reagent net consumption in the process is irrelevant. This paper is concerning the development of the PLACID electrowinning cell up to industrial size electrodes. The performed work has covered three levels of development: laboratory study, bench scale experimentation and pilot plant prototype testing (16 Kg/h electrolytic lead production). After 1,000 hours operating time, the achieved results of the pilot plant electrowinning cell have been very satisfactory, demonstrating the ability of the Placid electrowinning cell to produce top quality electrolytic lead (above 99.99% Pb) with high current efficiency and low energy consumption.

CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIMONY-GELATIN ADDITIVES IN ZINC SULPHATE ELECTROLYTES USING IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS:</B> X. Tang, Southwire Copper Division, 372 Central High Rd., Carrollton, GA 30117; P. Yu, T.J. O'Keefe, University of Missouri-Rolla, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Graduate Center for Materials Research, Rolla, MO 65409-1170; G. Houlachi, Noranda Technology Centre, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, H9R 1G5, Canada
<P>
Impedance measurements were used to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of acidic zinc sulphate electrolytes containing Sb3+, gelatin and their mixtures. The data were correlated with cyclic voltammetry curves made using synthetic as well as industrial electrolytes. The cyclic voltammetry results were similar to those obtained in previous studies in that antimony caused a depolarizing effect while gelatin gave an increase in the potential for zinc nucleation on an aluminum substrate. The electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) evaluations were conducted on electrodeposited zinc at three overpotential values. The potentials were chosen to represent various current density regions in the zinc polarization curves. The antimony and gelatin gave characteristic impedance plots which correlated with expected behaviour, particularly current efficiency. Both antimony and glue appear to modify the intermediate zinc reaction sequence, but in different ways. The data strongly suggest that film formation and stability are major factor in the zinc ion reduction mechanism.

<P>EFFECTS OF ANTIMONY AND CONTINUOUS GELATIN ADDITION ON CURRENT EFFICIENCY IN THE HUDSON BAY ZINC ELECTROWINNING TANKHOUSE: </B> P. Merrin, Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting Co., Limited, Flin Flon, Manitoba, R8A 1N9, Canada
<P>
This study was conducted at Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting's zinc electrowinning tankhouse to determine the effects of varying levels of antimony and continuous gelatin addition on current efficiency. The levels of antimony and gelatin were varied between 0.010-0.030 mg/l and 0-10 mg/l respectively, using the fresh electrolyte as reference. The test was designed to determine the optimum operating point for current efficiency, and to investigate any interaction that occurs between the two components. An non-linear mathematical model relating these three variables was produced, giving an optimum operating point of 6.5 mg/l of gelatin and increasing current efficiency with decreasing antimony levels. Individually, the antimony concentration was approximately linear with current efficiency, while gelatin concentration was parabolic. An interaction term is present but is not significant enough to improve the ability of the tankhouse to handle purification upsets in antimony.

<P>THE EFFECTS OF SOME FOAMING REAGENTS ON ACID MIST CONTROL AND ZINC ELECTROWINNING FROM KIDD CREEK ZINC ELECTROLYTE: </B> A.M. Alfantazi, D.B.

Bag 2002, Timmins, Ontario, P4N 7K1, Canada
<P>
<P>The effects of five commercially available foaming reagents (range of 0 to 25 ppm) namely Dowfroth 250 Saponin, Yucca, Licorice and Meta-Para Cresol on acid mist control, current efficiency, polarization behaviour, and deposit morphology and orientation were investigated using a bench scale electrolysis apparatus (cell volume 3L). The deposition was carried out at 500 Am-2 and 38&#176;C for 3 hours from Kidd Creek zinc electrolyte. The acid mist control capability of the various reagents was studied and compared by characterizing the foam layer generated during actual electrowinning conditions and by direct quantitative measurements of acid mist levels on top of the electrowinning cells. Within the range considered, the addition of these reagents reduced the current efficiency, refined the grain size of the deposit, and changed to preferred orientation of most of the deposits. Among the reagents tested, acid mist measurements indicated that Licorice and Dowfroth 250 were the best acid mist suppressant at emissions of 0.30 mg/m3 and 0.31 mg/m3 respectively while Yucca and MPC produced the most mist at 3.0 mg/m3 and 3.3 mg/m3 emission rates respectively.

<P>ELECTROPURIFICATION OF ZINC LEACHING SOLUTION:</B> S. Yamashita, K. Hata, S. Goto, Department of Metallurgy, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan
<P>
<P>The average consumption of zinc dust for purification of zinc leaching solution is more than 25 kg per ton of electrolytic zinc. Authors proposed to remove impurities in zinc leaching solution by electrolysis instead of cementation by zinc dust. The effects of copper and arsenic on electrodeposition of cobalt in zinc sulfate solution were examined fundamentally by using potentiostat. The mesh cathodes of stainless steel and lead anodes are used in the electrolytic cell for removal of cobalt and an electrolyte is circulating rate of electrolyte, concentration of copper and arsenious ions on removal of cobalt are studied. Removal of Ni, and Cd are also examined.

<P>Cl ANION ELIMINATION FROM Zn SULPHATE SOLUTION BY PERIODICAL REVERSE ELECTROLYTIC SYSTEM: </B> T. Yoshida, M. Kahata, M. Dobashi, M. Suzuki, Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd., Sairama, Japan
<P>
<P>In Japan, almost 30% of steel is produced by electric arc furnace (EAF) melting of iron scrap. And the dust from EAF includes approximately 20-30 wt % of Zn and 3.5 wt % of C1. They are treated as industrial waste to recover Zn as Zn oxide mainly by pyro metallurgical process. On the other hand, high purity zinc recovery by direct hydro-metallurgical processing is one of the most effective method. In this case, Cl in the EAF dust is dissolved in liquid phase by leaching, but the Cl anion in electrolyte attacks anode which is made of a lead base alloy. Several processes have been proposed to remove Cl anion from acidic sulfate solution. In this study, an electrolytic process is established to eliminate Cl anion from Zn sulfate electrolyte. It is known that Cl anion can be removed by anode oxidation. From our study it can be said that the elimination rate of Cl anion depend on the anode material, i.e. the elimination rate is Pb - Ag alloy &gt; Pb DSE. Furthermore in industrial electro-winning process, electrolyte includes Mn dioxide. Therefore, the effect of Mn in electrolyte should also be considered for Cl elimination. It seems that Mn dioxide deposition on anode decreases the efficiency of Cl anion removal. The periodical reverse system was induced to prevent from efficiency decrease. By using periodical reverse system, deposited Mn dioxide is removed very rapidly when the current was reversed for short time. More than 95% of Cl anion can be removed in extremely short period than conventional method. At the symposium the detailed data will be presented about Cl anion elimination by periodical reverse system.

<P>THE ROLE OF COPPER AND ANTIMONY ADDITIVES IN THE REMOVAL OF COBALT FROM ZINC SULPHATE SOLUTIONS: </B> V. Van der Pas, D. Dreisinger, University of British Columbia, Department of Metals and Materials Engineering, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4 Canada
<P>
<P>Zinc sulphate electrolyte used for zinc electrowinning must be purified for cobalt ions. The cobalt is removed in a cementation stage by the addition of zinc dust. Copper and antimony are frequently used additives which enhance the cementation of cobalt. This paper aims at a better understanding of how copper and antimony promote the removal of cobalt. Initial experiments were done in a batch cementation reactor. Copper and antimony precipitated in the early stages of cementation indicating that a preferential substrate was formed. The individual role of copper and antimony was further investigated in an electrochemical cell. On a microscale, the growth process, morphology and the composition of the precipitates under various conditions were examined with SEM and XRD. It was found that cobalt could not be deposited in its pure form but as a cobalt-zinc alloy with zinc as the prime constituent. The effect of copper addition is of increasing the cathodic surface area of zinc dust by precipitating as numerous dendrites. Antimony acts as a cathodic surface onto which a cobalt-zinc alloy with an increased cobalt content is deposited.

THE USE OF FRACTAL DIMENSION WITH AN AGGREGATION MODEL TO CHARACTERISE COPPER ELECTRODEPOSITION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIOUREA: </B> S.P. Fox, S.A. Godorr, A.W. Bryson, School of Process and Materials Engineering, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa<P>
This work is an extension of a previous investigation on the development of surface roughness during electrodeposition of copper. A comprehensive model based on diffusion and migration in a force field together with surface diffusion and sticking probabilities is used to generate profiles which are compared to those produced experimentally. The roughness is characterized by using the technique of fractal geometry which is shown to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively the development of surface morphology during electrodeposition. The work is extended to the deposition of copper in the presence of various concentrations of thiourea. The development of roughness is observed experimentally on the edge of a thin copper disc mounted between two glass plates. This enables photographs to be taken at various stages during growth. The surface outline is digitized using an image analyzer which enables the fractal dimension to be determined as growth proceeds. As expected the presence of thiourea at low concentrations produces a fractal dimension which is closer to unity (i.e. the surface becomes smoother). The original model is modified to include diffusion and migration of thiourea to the surface. It is postulated that the presence of thiourea on a surface site changes the sticking probability of discharged copper ions at this site. This results in increased surface diffusion of the copper, which in turn produces a smoother deposit. Extensive experimental results are presented which show that the model adequately predicts the effect of changes in thiourea concentrations over a wide range of conditions including those that are of relevance in electrorefining practice.

DIRECT RECOVERY OF METALS FROM LOADED ORGANIC SOLVENTS: A REVIEW OF RECENT METHODOLOGIES: </B> L.M. Abrantes, A.P. Paiva, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ci&ecirc;ncias, Departamento de Quimica, Lisboa, Portugal<P>
The application of hydrometallurgical methods to the recovery of metal values from ores and concentrates has been receiving a growing interest, either from researchers or from the mining industry. For the concentration/purification of the relatively low concentrated metallic solutions resulting form the leaching of those raw materials, a well established technique often used is solvent extraction (SX); the loaded organic solvent is then conventionally contacted with a suitable aqueous medium, the metal in its final form being usually recovered form this solution by electrowinning. Methods dealing with the direct stripping of metals from loaded organic extractants have recently been investigated, as an efficient stripping is sometimes difficult to achieve for some solvents. Amongst these innovating processes, the electroreductive stripping (2-phase electrolysis) and cementation (galvanic stripping) must be emphasized, the related research works being cautiously reviewed in the present paper. Particularly, the possibility of use of a 2 phase electrolysis to recover basic and precious metals is more extensively discussed. Examples are given for the recovery of copper and silver from suitable organic media, namely by direct application of an electrical potential to a mixture of a silver loaded organic phase containing Cyanex 471X - obtained by SX - and a stabilized sodium thiosulfate solution. The overall efficiencies of these one-step techniques are analyzed and compared with the results obtained by conventional stripping procedures. The purity of the cathodic deposits is also considered. The recovery of silver by galvanic stripping involving iron and zinc powders is also preliminarly evaluated, using a similar organic solution as described above. The influence of temperature on the efficiency of the process is also studied, either for concentrated or more diluted organic silver solutions. The literature data and the results reported here on the application of both methods for direct metal recovery from organic phases show promising advantages over the conventional procedures, encouraging a research effort to optimize and establish these alternative processes.

KINETICS MECHANISM OF GOLD ELECTROWINNING: </B> J.A. Garcia, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Argentina, C. Hecker, Universidad de Concepcion, Chile, E. Larenas, Concepcion, Chile<P>
To determine the kinetic reaction mechanism, electrochemical experimental techniques of stationary polarization, linear voltammetry and faradaic impedance were used. Gold electrodeposition experiments were realized using an electrolysis cell, provided by a rotary disk of vitreous carbon and or platinum counter electrode of platinum mesh and reference electrode. Using an automatic measurement system voltammograms and Nyquist faradaic impedance spectra were obtained. In this paper, responses for different cases were analyzed through faradaic impedance criteria, considering several kinds of diagrams obtained. The importance diffusion influence of aurocyanide ions and adsorption as controlling steps previous charge transfer was verified. A model of proposed mechanism is discussed.

AN INVESTIGATION ON GOLD ELECTROWINNING FROM ACIDIC THIOUREA SOLUTIONS: </B> C.M. Juarez, A.J.B. Dutra, Federa University of Rio de Janeiro, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil<P>
The use of thiourea as a gold leaching reagent has been extensively studied by many researchers, and it has proved to be promising for some cases as refractory gold ores and electronic gold scraps. Otherwise, the recovery of gold from these solutions did not receive so much attention. In this paper, the electrowinning of gold in acidic thiourea solutions was studied by voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance in a conventional three-electrode cell with a rotating disc electrode. These electrochemical techniques can provide valuable kinetic information to electrowinning practice. Results have shown that gold electrowinning should be carried out at low current densities in order to avoid cathode passivation and side reactions, as formamidine disulfide reduction and hydrogen evolution at higher overpotentials.

<B>ELECTROCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISSOLUTION OF GOLD IN CYANIDE ELECTROLYTES CONTAINING LEAD: </B> D. Mussatti, J. Mager , G.P. Martins, Colorado School of Mines, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Golden, CO 80401<P>
The role of lead (Pb), at low concentrations in high pH cyanide electrolytes, on the dissolution behaviour of gold has now been a topic of scientific and industrial concern for over 50 years. The recent paper by Kondos et al at CANMET (1995) attests to this continuing interest and apparent importance. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which this (and other heavy metal) component influences the electrodics of this electrochemical system has still not been unequivocally demonstrated. Instead, several plausible hypothesis, by pioneering researchers in this field, have been advanced and reiterated over the ensuing years. While it is generally accepted, based on electrode potential calculations, that co-reduction of lead on the gold surface may occur due to cementation (contact reduction) the cemented lead has never been characterized. The subject matter is confounded further when sulfide (or hydrosulfide) species are also a consitutent of the electrolyte. The work to be presented re-
 examines the role of lead and sulfide in this system, by considering the species distribution of these components and by conducting potentiodynamic studies in conjunction with surface analyses of a gold (and lead) electrode.

STUDY ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL PLATING SOLUTION USING RECOVERING PROCESSES: </B> Y. Kumagai, National Institute of Material &amp; Chemical Research, Laboratory of Organic Materials, Tsukuba, Japan; F.A. Souza, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Belo Horizonte, Brazil<P>
Electroless plating processes or chemical deposition processes, have been used in many fields such as automobile and electronic industries. These solutions must be disposed or treated even when the components already have high performance and concentrations. Commonly, in these kind of solution among others components, metal ions are in very high concentrations. The cost of the plating process becomes higher and is very difficult to keep the environmental regulations. The main objective of this study was to investigate the ways to recover the bath components, among them, the metal ion, in order to decrease the cost of the process as well as to meet the environmental regulations. Specifically, in this study was investigated the way to recover, from the exhausted bath, the nickel ion, sulfate ion, phosphite ion and organic compounds. In this case, was investigated a solution for electroless for nickel deposition. The metal ion was recovered from the wastewater by chemical plating onto mica powder surface. The phosphite and sulfate ions were recovered from the wastewater by precipitation as calcium salts. The organic acids were recovered by solvent extraction. These recovery process, used for the metal ion, is particularly important because many studies are investigating the use of mica coated with metal in the development of new composite materials.

THE EVALUATION OF FOAMING BEHAVIOUR OF SURFACTANTS FOR ACID MIST CONTROL IN METAL ELECTROLYSIS PROCESSES: </B> A.M. Alfantazi, D.B. Dreisinger, University of British Columbia, Department of Metals and Materials Engineering, Vancouver, B.C., V6T 1Z4, Canada; J. Synnott, M. Boissoneault, Falconbridge Ltd., Kidd Creek Division, P.O. Bag 2002, Timmins, Ontario, P4N 7K1 Canada<P>
Acid Mist Generation is a major concern in zinc, copper and nickel electrowinning industry and there is a strong environmental drive to control its emission in the work environment. Foaming reagents are typically added to the electrolyte to alleviate this problem. In zinc electrowinning, licorice and saponin are examples of foaming reagents used for this purpose. In order for the foaming reagent to be effective, its foaming behaviour must be determined. In this work, a test procedure was developed to study the foaming characteristics of various surfactants for use as foaming agents to control acid mist in aqueous metal electrowinning. This new test was termed a &quot;mini-flotation test&quot; and it was used to study the foaming behaviour of a large number of reagents in an industrial zinc electrolyte under simulated zinc electrowinning conditions (gas sparging). In addition, the influence of important parameters such as current density, electrolyte temperature, reagent addition level and sulfuric acid concentration on the foaming characteristics of the electrolyte for each surfactant were investigated. This study has identified the most important factors that influence foam formation, growth and stability. This method could be used as a process control measure for reagent addition in the cellhouse by generating a calibration curve for the optimum electrolyte conditions.

ELECTROWINNING COBALT FROM SULPHATE SOLUTIONS: </B> K.C. Lenthall, A.W. Bryson, Mintek, Private Bag X3015, Randburg, 2125, Republic of South Africa<P>
The effects of operating parameters on cobalt electrowinning from sulphate solutions were investigated. Experiments were carried out in a divided five-litre cell holding two anodes and a single cathode (150 by 105 mm). The cell was operated in a continuous manner and the catholyte conditions (pH and temperature) were controlled. The following parameters were chosen as a base for the investigation: cobalt feed concentration 90 g/l, catholyte pH 2.5, temperature 65&#176;C, current density 250 A/m2. The feed flow-rate was set to achieve a Co of 30 g/l. The cobalt concentration in the catholyte was varied from 25 to 65 g/l and the current efficiency was found to increase linearly from 90 to 96. Varying the catholyte pH from 2 to 2.75 caused efficiency to increase linearly from 91 to 98%, but above pH 2.75 the rate of increase slowed. Efficiency remained at 95% between 35 and 65&#176;C. Cathodic current density was varied between 150 and 350 A/m2 and did not affect efficiency. Only temperature and catholyte H+ were found to affect the nature of the deposit. Below pH 2.5 many small pits occur. Above this pH, the deposit is shinier and has fewer, though larger, pits. The temperature of the catholyte has a marked effect on the deposit since pitting on the metal decreases dramatically below 50&#176;C. In order to simulate realistic cell behaviour, control of catholyte pH was relaxed. The feed flow-rate was varied from 2.2 to 4.5 ml/min, corresponding to a Co of 30 to 60 g/l. The catholyte pH and cobalt concentration were both found to increase with increasing flow-rate, which caused an increase in efficiency from 82 to 99%. The cell is modeled by considering (i) the transport of H+ across the diaphragm, (ii) the effect of Co and H+ on efficiency using Wark's Rule, (iii) the overall mass balance across the cell.

RECOVERY OF BISMUTH AND ANTIMONY FROM THE ELECTROLYTE IN COPPER ELECTROREFINING TANKHOUSE:</B> <I>Kouji Ando</I>, Naoyuki Tsuchida, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd., Niihama Research Laboratories, Hydrometallurgical Research Center, 3-5-3, Nishibara, Niihama, Ehime 792, Japan
<P>
An ion-exchange process for recovery of antimony and bismuth from the copper electrorefining process has been studied on both a bench scale test and a pilot test. Recently, the ion exchange technique for the removal of antimony and bismuth from the electrolyte has been in a practice. In the existing technology, the metals recovered are required to process further. The separation of antimony and bismuth is sometime difficult and costly. Sumitomo Metal Mining has developed a noble process to recover antimony and bismuth metals directly from the eluent by an electrowinning. Furthermore, antimony and bismuth were successfully separated. The content of bismuth in antimony metal was less than 0.2%, while the content of antimony in bismuth metal was less than 0.4%.

THE USE OF POLYMER CONCRETE IN ACID CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT FOR ELECTROMETALLURGICAL PLANT PRACTICE:</B> G.J. Karcas, Corrosion Technology International, Gent, Belgium
<P>
Various non-ferrous Metals such as Copper, Nickel, Lead, Zinc and Precious Metals are produced via electrorefining and electrowinning processes. Apart from controlling electro-chemical conditions for the production of these metals, there has always existed the challenge of controlling the severely deleterious effect of the aqueous environment which serves as the medium for the production of these metals. The practice of acid containment in electrometallurgical operations has entered the world of high technology with the advent of advanced acid resistant materials such as Vinyl Ester Resin which is either combined with concrete to form Polymer Concrete or used to coat or line various acid containing vessels and surfaces. The North and South American copper industry has indulged quite heavily in the use of polymer concrete cells, electrolyte storage tanks, and the use of Vinyl Ester Resin for corrosion protective systems. Electrolytic cell and electrolyte storage tank construction has undergone a transformation from a multiple part configuration to a single piece unit. The combination of a wood, steel, or concrete frame with a lining made of lead, asphalt, rubber or plastic has been historically successful in providing protection from chemical and mechanical attack in electrolytic cells and electrolyte storage tanks all over the world. These combinations have now entered the world of obsolescence as materials such as polymer concrete have proven to provide exceptional corrosion and mechanical protection with greatly reduced maintenance requirements. Polymer concrete cells and electrolyte storage tanks fall into the category of modern tankhouse equipment which includes anode preparation machines and stainless steel cathodes, all of which play a vital role in improving quality and productivity while lowering operating costs. Polymer Concrete Cells, and other modern equipment, are succeeding in the difficult, yet important, task of driving electrometallurgical plants into the next millennium.

POSSIBILITIES TO LOWER ENERGY USE IN ELECTROWINNING BY MODIFICATIONS OF LEAD ANODES: </B> O. Fors&eacute;n , J. Aromaa, Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Corrosion and Material Chemistry, Vuorimiehentie 2, FIN-02150, Espoo, Finland
<P>
Lead alloys are most common anodes in metal electrowinning processes from acid solutions, even though their oxygen overpotential is very high. New inventions like mixed metal oxide anodes are not widely used, the main reasons being possibly doubts on the anode operation and large capital investments on the existing lead anodes. The main reaction on lead anodes in sulphate solutions is oxygen evolution, and on the lead dioxide film it has a high overpotential. In this paper we have studied possibilities to decrease the energy consumption in metal electrowinning by lowering the anode overpotential. Samples from currently used anode material were coated with different lead alloys using plasma spraying and detonation coating. Also modifications on the anode microstructure by melting and controlled cooling and additions of certain ions to the electrolyte were studied. Most of the studied procedures were able to lower the anode potential about 100 - 150 mV at the operating current density of 500 A/m2. Rapid cooling during the anode casting was found to be the simplest and thus also the least expensive way to lower the anode potential.

STUDIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANODE FOR LEAD ELECTROWINNING: </B>D.J. Robinson, Dremco Inc., Point Roberts, WA; T.J. O'Keefe, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO
<P>
The pyrometallurgical method of recycling car batteries suffers from a potential for air pollution violations, which prompts the desire for a viable hydrometallurgical alternative. Several Processes have been proposed, including leach-electrowinning routes using HBF4 and/or H2SiF6 based electrolytes, along with anodes of PbO2 on inert substrates. A study has been carried out to evaluate the proposed systems, with the intention of demonstrating a six month life of an electrolyte-anode combination. The work, which focused on the use of H2SiF6, has indicated that there was no acceptable anode, and has lead to the development of a technique to produce smooth, glassy, adherent coatings on graphite, and to the development of an anode composed of a series of copper cored graphite rods. The paper will present results on leaching and electrowinning experiments, as well as the description of a flowsheet for a pilot plant that will be used to produce one tone per day of refined lead from spent battery paste.

APPLICATION OF ELECTROCHEMICAL MEMBRANE METHODS IN HYDROMETALLURGY OF COPPER: </B> A.S. Mustafinova, A.A. Zharmenov, Chemical-Metallurgical Institute, Karaganda, Republic of Kazakstan
<P>
Production of electrolytic copper is characterized by large volumes of acidic spent solutions the utilization of which requires considerable expenditures of neutralizing agents. At present, an economically substantiated technology does not exist for treatment of sulfuric acid rinse solutions and spent copper electrolyte which will allow for repeated use of the acid and the metal salts. Therefore, for this aim the most advantageous is the use of electromembrane methods. In the paper there is stated the essence of developed technologies which are distinguished by low waste and provide the extraction from the solutions of metallic copper, nickel and sulphuric acid. There are also considered methods of copper electrolyte processing allowing to regulate its composition by that or another component (H2SO4, Cu, Ni, As). On the base of the detailed study of the behaviour of various types of ion- exchanger membranes in copper-, nickel-, zinc-, arsenic- bearing sulphate solutions there is realized the selection of the most suitable membranes (MK-401, MA-411, MB-2 and MKL-1/MAL-2). Some variants of electromembrane processing of spent solutions of the hydrometallurgy process have passed productions tests on a number of copper-electrolyte enterprises of the countries of CIS (cooperation of Independent States). These tests showed high efficiency of developed methods.

ELECTROMETALLURGY, PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE:</B> F. Habashi, Laval University, Department of Mining and Metallurgy, Quebec City, Quebec, G1K 7P4, Canada
<P>
While pyrometallurgy is an ancient art and hydrometallurgy can be traced to the Middle Ages, electrometallurgy is the most recent technology since it started only after the discovery of electric current in the ninteenth century. Davy, Faraday, and Bunsen laid the foundation of this technology which had a great impact on other areas of metallurgy, e.g., the liberation of aluminum for the first time from its salts. Once aluminum was available, it was used to liberate other metals from their oxides. Electrometallurgical processes, however, are capital intensive. Improvement of the present technology should be intensely investigated.

INDUSTRIAL IN-PULP Co-Ni ALLOY ELECTRO-WINNING AT THE GECAMINES-SHITURU PLANT:</B> K. Twite, J.-M. Dereydt, K. Mujinga, Gecamines Shituru Plant/Likasi, Bd. du Souverain 30, 32, B1170 Brussels, Belgium; P. Louis, Union Miniere, All&eacute;e de la Fr&egrave;naie, B 1300 Wavre, Belgium
<P>
GECAMINES is a large mining concern and the world's leading cobalt producer having some of the richest cobalt deposits in the world. Cobalt is associated in the ore with copper as sulphides and oxides and in some locations with nickel too. Specific hydrometallurgical processes have been developed by GECAMINES which had done an important contribution to the development of the cobalt hydrometallurgy. In the Shituru plant, cobalt is obtained from an unique in-pulp electrolysis process, while in Luilu, cobalt is electrolyzed in a clear acidic solution giving a purer deposit. In the beginning of 1996 Shituru started the treatment of mixed Cu-Co-Ni Shinkolobwe hydrates obtained as by-product of an uranium solvent extraction plant. A typical analysis of this feedstock is: Cu: 2%, Co: 8%, Ni: 4%. The nickel sulfide depolarized cementation process developed previously by GECAMINES was inefficient to treat such a high level of Nickel contamination and it was decided to produce alloyed Cobalt-Nickel cathodes in the Shituru tankhouse. As anticipated from laboratory tests as previous studies and publications, a lower Ni/Co in the deposit was obtained compared to the Ni/Co ratio solution, despite the nickel reversible electrochemical potential is somewhat higher than the one of cobalt (-0.25 V vs -0.28 V). In this paper, the process flow-sheet and production data are given. Cobalt alloy with 5 - 20 % Ni was obtained at a production level of 300 t per month. The process developed is a first industrial realization in this way, bringing a new contribution to cobalt hydrometallurgy.

ELECTROLYTIC PROCESSING OF MANGANIFEROUS SILVER ORES IN ACIDIC NITRATE MEDIUM: </B>O. Rutten, S. Van Sandwijk, G. Van Weert, Department of Raw Materials Technology, Delft University of Technology, Mijnbouwstraat 120, 2628 RX Delft, The Netherlands
<P>
Cathodic and anodic reactions in the acidic nitrate medium were studied in reference to the electrolytic production of manganese dioxide from pyrolusite (Mn02) ores by reductive leaching. Two USA ores were investigated. The reductant for Mn02 is produced cathodically and can either be nitrous acid or nitrogen oxide gas. In this work emphasis was placed on the nitrous acid leach. Manganese and silver are solubilized, iron is not. Cathodic regneration of nitrous acid was investigated in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 M nitric acid, 0.0 to 0.1 nitrous acid on graphite, platinum and platinized titanium cathodes at 20 to 80&#176;C. It was established that the formation of the nitrosyl ion (N0+) is a prerequisite for the cathodic reduction of nitric acid. At cathode potentials &lt; +700 mV (SHE), cathodic reduction of nitrous acid to nitric oxide takes place. Anodic deposition of manganese is as flaky <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">-Mn02, similar to that produced in sulphate electrolytes. A conceptual flowsheet is presented and discussed.

A NOVEL ELECTROMETALLURGICAL PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY GOLD CONCENTRATES: </B> N. de Jager, M.J. Nicol, University of the Witwatersrand, School of Process and Materials Engineering, Johannesburg, South Africa
<P>
In order to liberate gold from refractory gold ores and concentrates it is necessary to oxidize the surrounding sulphide minerals, typically pyrite and arsenopyrite. Traditional methods of oxidation include pressure leaching, roasting and bacterial oxidation. In recent years, bacterial oxidation has found increasing favour, although it is by no means completely satisfactory and is subject to large residence times. It is also extremely sensitive to operating conditions. Similarly, pressure leaching and roasting have their own particular disadvantages. A novel process has been developed as an alternative to the traditional methods whereby electro-generated ferrate [iron (VI)] ions in alkaline solution are used to oxidize a pyrite concentrate. This process has been observed to proceed fairly rapidly and could prove to be a more economically viable process, as well as being more environmentally acceptable. As an added benefit, operating in an alkaline environment is advantageous for downstream cyanidation processes. Iron (VI) is a relatively unknown species, due mainly to its instability in acidic solutions. However in alkaline solution it has been observed to be sufficiently stable for use as an oxidant when kept under the correct conditions. Iron (VI) is most conveniently manufactured electrolytically via the dissolution of high-carbon iron anodes in strongly alkaline solutions. Some literature has been published on the electrolytic generation of iron (VI) and relatively high efficiencies have been observed by both the authors and other researchers. This study utilizes both electrochemical techniques and leaching experiments to examine the kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of pyrite by iron (VI). Cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk voltammetry and potential step experiments have been used to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the oxidation process. Other potentiodynamic and poteniostatic techniques have also been employed. Leaching experiments have been used to provide a more detailed investigation into the kinetics of the process.

ELECTROLYTIC RECOVERY OF MERCURY FROM LOW CONCENTRATION BRINE SOLUTIONS: </B> M. Rockandel, Universal Dynamics Ltd., Vancouver, Canada
<P>
Universal Dynamics Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada has developed, patented and commercialized the &quot;REMERC&quot; process for the treatment of mercury contaminated sludges and soils. Mercury is extracted into an acidified and oxidizing, sodium chloride brine solution. REMERC was initially developed to treat mercury contaminated EPA listed wastes (K106) generated by the chlor-alkali industry. More recent work has expanded the capability of REMERC to include remediation of mercury contaminated sites, equipment and building materials. In the process mercury is currently recovered from solution by cementation on iron powder in an agitated reactor. The process recovers high purity elemental mercury (99.9% purity). Cementation typically recovers about 90-95% of the mercury in 30 minutes. Higher recovery is not necessary because of the recirculation of the leach solution. When treating highly contaminated chloralkali wastes (5-13% mercury content), REMERC will reduce the mercury laden solutions from 400-1,000 mg/l mercury to 50-100 mg/l. In the treatment of less concentrated wastes (&lt;1,000 mg/kg mercury) such as those encountered in site remediation, the treated solutions will generally contain 10-20 mg/l mercury. Cementation while being simple and able to achieve the required recovery has the undesirable properties of; requiring a solid-liquid separation and adding iron to solution which must be precipitated, ultimately increasing the weight of residue to landfill. The potential advantages of electrolysis were recognized early in the development of REMERC. Mercury electrolysis is well known in gold and chloralkali processing. Initial testwork utilized a liquid mercury cathode and a coated titanium anode both common to chloralkali producers. The mercury cathode appeared susceptible to polarization and solution impurities significantly affected performance. Agitation of the mercury pool improved performance but it was still not possible to achieve the reduction objectives. Current efficiencies were low, near 10%, and it was apparent that a relatively large cathode pool would be required to limit the current density. A number of electrode combinations with and without a membrane were then tested in a vertical electrode configuration but the desired performance was not obtained. In 1995 Universal Dynamics working with Dremco Ltd. of Arizona, USA began the development of a plate and frame style electrolytic cell. The objective of the electrolytic process was to achieve similar removals to those obtained by cementation, while producing high purity elemental mercury (&gt;99.9% purity) and chlorine at the anode. Although current efficiency is a relatively minor concern the design objective was to achieve at least 50% CE. The current efficiency goal would require operation of the cell at current densities approaching the limiting current flow. The final cell current densities would therefore be in the range of 0.1 - 1.0 A/m2. Operation of a laboratory scale cell has demonstrated that the operating objectives can be achieved with a cell consisting of closely spaced shiny titanium cathodes and ruthenium oxide coated titanium anodes. Numerous variables were observed to be important including; inter electrode velocity, current density, pH and chlorine stripping. The cell has been tested on solutions generated by two REMERC operations, solution produced during site remediation pilot testing and on more highly concentrated solutions generated by oxidation of calomel generated at Cominco Metals, Norzink facility in Trail, B.C.

RECOVERY OF Cu2+ AND Cd2+ FROM DILUTE AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS BY ION FLOTATION AND ELECTROLYSIS: </B>F.M.

<P>
Copper and cadmium metal has been recovered from dilute (3 X 10-4 mol/dm3) chloride solutions by ion flotation with dodecysulfate, followed by electrolysis. This approach should facilitate treatment of effluents too dilute for effective direct electrolysis. The adsorption density of metal dodecylsulfate complexes on bubble surfaces was estimated from surface tension data, and compared well with experimentally-observed metal removal kinetics, and ultimate recoveries. Copper and cadmium were recovered by electrolyzing the foamate, using steel wool cathodes and a graphite anode. The stability constants of the copper and cadmium dodecysulfate complexes are estimated, and used to analyze the thermodynamics of electrolysis. Dodecysulfate was unaffected by the electrolysis process, and hence could be recycled to ion flotation. A conceptual flowsheet for an overall effluent-treatment process is presented.

NITROX METALS CORPORATION'S PROCESS FOR DIRECT LEACHING OF COPPER CONCENTRATES:</B> R.N. O'Brien, E. Peters, Vancouver, B.C., V6N 2G1
<P>
It has been discovered that copper concentrates can be leached in strong (40-60%) sulfuric acid with air as the primary oxidant, if nitric acid is present as a catalyst. Chalcopyrite is rapidly decomposed at temperatures well below the boiling temperature of the lixiviant (150C.) and the resulting copper and ferric salts are precipitated as CuSO4 H2O or CuSO43 H2O and FeH(SO4)24H2O. Other metal sulfides such as zinc, lead, nickel, etc. are also converted to sulfates that are nearly insoluble. Sulfur is partially converted to elemental and partially to sulfuric acid. Reduction products of nitric acid can be recovered from the distillate with good recovery. Conversion of as-received copper concentrates is largely complete in about 1 hour. A number of process flow sheets are possible, and one that utilizes existing solvent extraction and electrowinning technology is considered economically feasible. This flow sheet involves (a) separation of metal sulfates and unleachable residues from excess acid by centrifuge, (b) water leaching of salts with partial neutralization (with limestone) of excess acid, to a tenor of 10 g/l Cu2+, (c) solvent extraction of copper using one of the LIX reagents, and (d) precipitating most of the ferric iron from raffinate with more limestone, so that it can be used as recycled water in step (a). Gold and silver are retained in a water insoluble small volume residue also containing any elemental sulfur formed, while minor elements like arsenic, antimony, etc. are retained by the strong sulfuric acid that is centrifuged from solids in step (a). These can be removed from this solution using methods previously developed for the purification of copper electrorefining electrolytes.

ACID RECOVERY AND PURIFICATION USING ABSORPTION RESIN TECHNOLOGY:</B> M. Sheedy, Prosep Technologies Inc., Pickering, Ontario, Canada
<P>
Strong mineral acids, principally sulphuric, are widely used as electrolytes for the electrorefining and electrowinning of metals. Impurities in these electrolytes are controlled by continuously bleeding solution form the tank house. In addition to the contaminant these bleed streams contain high levels of sulphuric acid and the metal being recovered. Subsequent treatment of these bleed streams often requires neutralization which generates large volumes of solid waste. Absorption resin technology employing a novel ion exchange technique known as Recoflo allows the separation of the mineral acid from dissolved metal salts. The recovered acid is suitable for recycle back to the electrolyte circuit. The metal salt and other contaminants leave the process free of sulphuric acid. In this process, known commercially as the APU, ion exchange resin is used to sorb sulphuric acid while excluding the metal salts. The purified acid is then removed by washing the resin with water. The process has been extensively used for the recovery of waste pickling acids in the steel industry and anodizing solutions in the aluminum industry. In the mining industry the process has been successfully evaluated for the separation of excess sulphuric acid from copper electrolytes, the removal of magnesium and manganese contaminants from zinc electrolytes, and antimony, bismuth and nickel from copper electrolytes.

A PYRIDINE-BASED TRIDENTATE CHELATING SOLVENT EXTRACTION SYSTEM FOR SELECTIVE EXTRACTION OF NICKEL AND COBALT</B>: Batric Pesic1, and Taili Zhou2, 1University of Idaho, College of Mines-McClure Hall, Moscow, ID 83843; 2The Shepherd Chemical Co., 4900 Beech St., Cincinnati, OH 45212<P>
A novel pyridine-based tridentate chelating extractant, 2,6bis-[5-n-nonylpyrazo-3-yl] pyridine (BNPP), has been developed and characterized. The solvent extraction of Ni and Co by a mixed system of BNPP and dinonyl naphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNSA) was studied as a function of pH, diluent, temperature, and DNNSA concentration. Stripping of Ni and Co was examined as a function of HCl and H2SO4 concentration. The novel system can extract Ni and/or Co selectively against Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, and Al from acidic sulfate solutions at a pH as low as 0.5. Separation of Ni and Co can be achieved either during loading, or during stripping stages of solvent extraction. The extractant system is stable and can be regenerated with acid. The novel solvent extraction system was also tested on the real solutions produced by leaching of cobalt bearing concentrates, (1) cobaltite concentrate from Blackbird Mine, Idaho, and (2) siegenite concentrate from Lead-Belt, Missouri. A flowsheet for recovery of cobalt and nickel has been proposed based on these studies. The review of the current status of solvent extractants for cobalt and nickel will be given by comparative presentation with our novel extractantion system.

DIELECTRIC STUDIES ON PbS-KEX-K2Cr207 SYSTEM UNDER FLOTATION CONDITIONS:</B> Antonio Huerta, Juan Genesca, Armando Solis, Dept. de Ingenieria Metalurgica, Fac.de Qulmica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Cd. Universitaria, CP.04510, Mexico<P>
The effects of potassium ethyl xanthate used as collector and dichromate potassium a depressor on a PbS mineral were studied by the recently accepted technique in Mexico, high frequency impedance (transformed to dielectric values). Results of dielectric values at 100 MHz suggested that is possible to obtain from isotherm adsorption the adequate industrial collector concentration being this in the range of 1E-3 to 5E-3M of KEX. The e' values (320-420) in the PbS-KEX system was increased as the KEX concentration was lowered). In the other hand the PbSK2Cr207 system showed higher values of e' (420-510) as the K2Cr207 concentration was increased. The PbS-KEX-K2Cr207 system was evaluated, obtaining the KEX concentration dominion on K2Cr207.

GYPSUM CRYSTALLIZATION IN ACIDIC WASTEWATER TREATMENT: A REVIEW OF CURRENT PRACTICE AND A VIEW ON PROCESS IMPROVEMENT:</B> <I>S. Omelon</I>, G.P. Demopoulos, McGill Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, 3450 University St., Montreal, Canada H3A 2A7<P>
Acidic sulphate-containing wastewater streams are currently neutralized with lime before discharge to the environment. The most common neutralization process design involves a one-step neutralization followed by a settling tank that separates an ultra-fine, low solids density gypsum by-product. The final gypsum quality is undesirable as it is voluminous and has a high surface area that sorbs metal ions. The paper will critically review the current practice of gypsum precipitation. It will also report the progress of a project which uses crystallization principles and supersaturation control to develop a new process. The new process design utilizes a model that was constructed to predict gypsum solubilities in H2SO4-ZnSO4-FeSO4-MnSO4-MgSO4 solutions from 25-60&#176;C. By maintaining a low gypsum supersaturation with a series of CSTR's and providing gypsum seed with a solids recycle, the generation of high solids density gypsum is favoured. Early results will be presented, as well as results on Zn2+ adsorption.

ANALYSIS OF THE HEMATITE PRECIPITATION PROCESS FROM A CRYSTALLIZATION POINT OF VIEW:</B> T.C.-M. Cheng, G.P. Demopoulos, McGill Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, 3450 University St., Montreal, Canada H3A 2A7<P>
Iron removal and disposal in zinc and nonferrous hydrometallurgical plants at large constitutes one of the major environmental challenges to the industry. So far three technologies have been used by the zinc industry to effect iron rejection, namely the Jarosite, the Goethite, and the Hematite Processes. Among them, it is the Jarosite Process that has dominated the scene. However jarosite residues tend to be voluminous (only 25% Fe content) and highly toxic due to incorporation of Zn, Cd, Pb, and other heavy metals, not to mention the relatively high Zn losses. The industry addresses the heavy metal release problem by further stabilizing jarosite prior to disposal as is done, for example, in the Jarofix Process. On the other hand, hematite residues produced by the Hematite Process have a very high iron content and low zinc losses but come with a relatively high operating cost. At present, commercial produced hematite residues are still considered a waste because of the impurities contained in them whereas the two major troublesome impurities are sulfur and zinc. Hematite technology may become more attractive if the produced hematite is clean enough to be used as a feed material for iron-steel making. In this paper, the practice of industrial hematite precipitation and the relevant technical literature are reviewed with the objective to identify the critical processing parameters which are responsible for the contamination of hematite with sulfur and zinc. The analysis is done from a crystallization theory standpoint. The role of supersaturation control or lack of it is emphasized in the analysis. Finally, the main elements of a research program focus ing on crystallization of hematite that is currently underway at McGill University will be outlined.

INFLUENCE OF HYDROLYSIS--PRECIPITATION MEDIUM ON THE NATURE OF ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GELS AND Al203 POWDER CHARACTERISTICS:</B> M. Thiruchitrambalam, V.R. Palkar*, V. Gopinathan, P. Ramakrishnan, M.S.

Aluminium hydroxide gels have been widely used in applications like sorbents and catalyst supports. Thermal treatment of aluminium hydroxide gels i.e., calcination and/or sintering, first leads to dehydration and then a series of phase changes. Once dehydration is complete several transition aluminium oxides namely <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> appear, and finally <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> Al2O3 is formed at about 1200&#176;C. In the current investigation boehmite (AIOOH) a bayerite (Al(OH)3) have been prepared in the presence of water-glycerol solutions. The results indicate that the precipitation media have considerable influence on the nature of aluminium hydroxide precipitate. Aluminium hydroxide gels thus prepared were characterised by TEM and XRD. Calcined powders were examined by XRD for phase content, by SEM for morphology and BET method for specific surface area. Calcination of aluminium hydroxide gels prepared by Hot water hydrolysis-Controlled precipitation technique yielded agglomerate free, spherical a Al2O3 powder. Al2O3 was also prepared by calcining the aluminium hydroxide gels at 600&#176;C and characterised by XRD, TEM and BET method.

CONTINUOUS BACTERIAL LEACHING OF A LOW-GRADE MANGANESE DIOXIDE ORE: </B> <I>S. Agatzini Leonardou, </I>J.G. Zafiratos, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece<P>
The leaching of a Greek low-grade manganese dioxide ore, not amenable to conventional mineral processing operations, was studied using a mixed culture of <I>Thiobacillus sp.</I> bacteria. The experiments were carried out in specially designed continuously aerated and stirred tank reactors arranged in two-tank series. The first tank of each series was loaded with an elemental sulfur culture suspension while the second was loaded with a manganese ore high density slurry. The bacterial culture had been previously adapted to grow on elemental sulphur and also in the presence of manganese ore and dissolved manganous ion. A two level full factorial design, was constructed in order to study the effects of the ferric ion concentration in the leach solution, the &quot;elemental sulphur weight to ore weight&quot; ratio, the ore pulp density and the composition of the dispersed gas. The responses which were investigated included percentage manganese recovery, co-dissolution of iron and manganese dissolution rate. Parameters with constant values throughout the experiment were the leach solution pH, the nutrient medium composition, the dilution rate and the ore and sulphur grain sizes. It was found that the ferric ion concentration was the most significant factor and had a positive effect on the final percentage extraction of manganese from the ore and also on the rate of manganese solubilisation from the ore. The effects of the other factors studied are discussed in detail.

Ni, Co &AMP; Cr RECOVERY FROM NICKEL LATERITE LEACH LIQUORS BY BIOSORPTION USING IMMOBILISED ALGAL BIO-MASS:</B> S. Agatzini-Leonardou, J.G. Zafiratos, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece<P>
The objective of this work was to prove repeated loading capacities of physically stabilized algal biomass from Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. for the removal and recovery of cobalt, nickel and chromium from laterite heap leach liquors. The testwork was carried out on a bench scale in small columns and proved that it is possible to immobilize the biomass on the highly porous surface of pumice stone. Nickel and cobalt could be removed from pure aqueous solutions of each metal by cyanobacterial biomass of the species Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. immobilized on the mineral. Nickel and also cobalt biosorption was sensitive to the initial solution pH. The maximum amount of cobalt was retained on the biomass at pH 6.0, while nickel was removed most effectively at pH 5.5. Repeated loading capacities of physically stabilized algal biomass from Spirulina platensis and Chlorella sp. were proven effective for the removal and recovery of cobalt and nickel from solutions resembling diluted laterite heap leach liquors. A lifetime of at least 5 loading cycles of the immobilized biosorbent material was obtained. The loading capacity of the immobilized biomass for nickel was comparatively lower than the capacity of the same biomass for cobalt. Cobalt recoveries up to 80% were achieved after 5 loading cycles under unoptimized conditions whereas nickel was removed completely (100%) under the same conditions. The described process might be applicable to recover cobalt from diluted laterite heap leach solutions.

PREDICTING THE FORMABILITY OF ALUMINUM AUTOBODY SHEET ALLOYS:</B> J. Daniel Bryant, Tatsuhito Koya, Armand J. Beaudoin, Reynolds, Metals Corporate Research and Development, Fourth and Canal Streets, P.O. Box, 27003, Richmond, VA 23261
<P>
While aluminum alloys based on the Al-Si-Mg-Cu system are currently being used in the production of a number of automotive body panels, the continuing demands for improved formability in these alloys have led alloy developers to the study of novel compositions and processing practices. Predicting stamping performance for a wide range of alloy variants, however, remains a difficult problem. Uniaxial tension tests, while providing reproducible assessments of mechanical behavior, are performed in a strain state that is quite different from that encountered in most stamping operations. As such, more elaborate, and often and less reproducible, methods of assessment are often employed, such as limiting dome height measurements and the construction of forming limit curves. In the present work, we have analyzed the tensile behavior of a series candidate alloys and used these data to predict the forming limit curve over a range of strain states. Using a modified form of the Voce work-hardening model, a Marciniak-Kuczinski simulation has been constructed and used to predict the forming limit curve minimum (FLC0). These predictions are then related to experimentally determined forming limit curve data for the candidate alloys. The comparison of predicted and measured forming limit curve data indicates that the model can be successfully used to predict mechanical behavior under a state of plane strain using uniaxial tensile data. The results of the model indicate that the slope of the work-hardening curve, particularly at high strain values, is intimately related to the forming limit curve minimum. These correlations provide alloy developers with an inexpensive method of comparing the formability new alloy variants by more thoroughly exploiting the data concealed within the full uniaxial tensile curve.

TOOL WEAR DURING MACHINING OF AA356 ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>Zhongnan Dai</I>, J.G. Morris, Light Metals Research Labs, Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506
<P>
As a casting material, AA356 Aluminum alloy is widely used in the automotive industry. During machining, the tool wear mechanism for this alloy is significantly different from that for steel. For different as-cast metallurgical microstructures, materials with harder dispersed particles and stronger matrices show higher resistance to seizure because of an increase in the pressure requirement above which seizure occurs. This results in better machinability. On the other hand, hard particles act as small cutting edges on the tool materials, thereby causing tool wear due to the particle's abrasive characteristics. The wear characteristics of cutting tools were investigated in this study. Scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, EDX analysis were used to identify wear mechanisms. The results obtained show that there are a number of different wear mechanisms that contribute to tool damage, and hence, to tool-life. The role of the as cast microstructure on tool wear was also studied in order to determine under what structural states tool wear would be reduced.

THE EFFECTS OF PREAGING TREATMENTS ON FORMABILITY AND PAINT BAKE RESPONSE IN ALUMINUM AUTOBODY SHEET ALLOYS</B>: J. Daniel Bryany, Reynolds Metals Company, Corporate Research and Development, Fourth and Canal Streets, P. O. Box 27003, Richmond, VA 23261
<P>
The use of heat treatable aluminum alloys for automotive body panels is presently increasing, due to aluminum's attractive combination of low density and compatibility with current production methods. In these applications, the automotive paint bake cycle is used to impart a modest artificial aging response, referred to as the paint bake response (PBR), in the alloys following stamping. Unfortunately, the short duration of the paint bake cycle (as dictated by production demands) is generally insufficient to exploit more than a small fraction of the age hardening potential of the alloys. Reynolds Metals Company has developed a thermal treatment which has been shown to be effective in increasing the paint bake response by up to a factor of four, while at the same time improving the formability of alloys and reducing the natural aging rate. Through the use of atomic resolution microscopy and differential thermal calorimetry, the mechanism of pre-aging can be shown to be the result of changes in the precipitation sequence of metastable variants of Mg2Si, resulting in an increase in the precipitation kinetics during the paint bake cycle and a finer distribution of strengthening precipitates in the painted component. Through the use of pre-aging, our research has shown that 6XXX autobody sheet alloys may be produced which have both superior stamping performance as well as higher strengths in the stamped and painted components, resulting in automotive body panels with up to 50% higher dent resistance.

THE EFFECT OF THE DISPLACEMENT CONTROL ROUTINE ON THE ELONGATION TO FAILURE AND FAILURE MORPHOLOGIES IN SUPER PLASTIC AA 5083:</B> A.L. Lund, S.G. Pitman, M.A. Khaleel, M.T. Smith, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
It has been noted in the literature that superplastically formed Al alloys fail by cavitation. The morphology of the final cavitated fracture region may be important in determining optimum forming conditions, by determining whether failure occurs parallel or perpendicular to the principal stresses. In addition, the displacement control routine may have a large effect on the total elongation that can be expected during forming operations. Tests were performed to evaluate failure in a AA5083 base alloy, by the following methods: 1) uniaxial tension tests at a constant true strain rate were interrupted at 80%, 60,G, 40%, and 5% of the maximum load, and microstructurally evaluated to identify the failure path and 2) tests were performed with various displacement control routines, and the elongation to failure was measured. The following displacement routines were used: smooth test, two-step strain test, multi-bump strain rate tests with various sizes of bumps scheduled at various intervals, and variable load oscillation tests.

EVOLUTION OF ALUMINUM MICROSTRUCTURES IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PROCESS:</B> Woiciech Z. Misiolek, Aluminum Processing Program, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, New York 121803590
<P>
The final microstructure and its uniformity is responsible for the physical properties and surface quality of the extruded profiles. Extrusion is time dependent process and its deformation variables such as, deformation zone and dead zone geometry as well as extrusion speed and temperature, change in time. The final microstructure depends on the above mentioned extrusion parameters as well as billet microstructure and post processing treatment. Metal flow conditions are influenced by the process parameters. Both physical and numerical process modeling techniques have been applied to predict metal flow behavior during extrusion through dies with different geometries. Additional information, allowing understanding of microstructure evolution, can be obtained from the crystallographic characterization of the typical deformation zone regions such as dead metal zone, main deformation zone and recrystallized zone on the billet-container interface using the electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) technique. This technique has been utilized to follow in detail the orientation aspects of the deformed grains in extruded aluminum. This analysis provides information which can be used in the die and process design to improve metal flow uniformity and therefore the microstructure of the final product. It also allows prevention of the typical extrusion defects like surface tearing.

FILLER METAL-ASSISTED RESISTANCE SPOT WELDING TECHNIQUE:</B>  Hua-Xin Li, Mark T. Smith, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
A new technique is developed to overcome or minimize the inherent problems associated with aluminum RSW. Test results on 1 mm thick 6061 aluminum alloy sheets have shown that the new method can dramatically improve almost all of the problems encountered using conventional RSW. By using the new method, the following improvements have been achieved: 1) reducing/eliminating electrode contamination; 2) eliminating/minimizing surface indentation and deformation; 3) increased weld nugget size by 200% with same welding parameters; 4) maintaining consistent weld nugget size; and 5) no cleaning is needed, particularly at faying surfaces. Peeling strength is high and failure in peeling testing occurs in base metal around weld nugget. Metallographic investigation shows favorable oval nugget shape on cross section, which can improve weld nugget high peeling strength. The ratio of major axis to minor axis is 7 with major axis being 6.5 mm long. Weld nugget mechanical properties such as tension-shear strength is being evaluated and will be presented.

<P>
The utilization of aluminum alloys for lightweight automotive structures can be increased by improved formability and a reduction of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) problems associated with magnesium additions greater than about 3%. We have utilized a series of thermomechanical treatments on several 5xxx alloys (5052, 5082, 5083, 5454 and 5754) to alter the dispersoid density and size, as well as the distribution of eutectic constituents. The aim has been to optimize grain size for specific forming operations and post-formed properties. In addition, the role of the grain size and particle distribution, as well as the magnesium content and microstructure, on the SCC resistance has been investigated. It was found that the grain size could be controlled by the distribution of the dispersoid particles, with a minimum grain diameter of 8 &#181;m achieved in the 5083. The effect of grain size on SCC susceptibility was also evaluated.

APPLICATION OF THE METAL COMPRESSION FORMING PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AN ALUMINUM ALLOY COMPONENT: </B> R.M. Purgert, Precision Metal Forming Co., P.O. Box 25441, Garfield Heights, OH 44125; S. Viswanathan, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6083<P>
Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process also enhances the solidification rate of the metal promoting a very fine grain structure which results in improved properties. Consequently, the process is capable of producing parts with properties close to that of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper will describe the casting process development involved in the production of a 356 alloy engine mounting bracket, including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters. Tensile and fatigue properties of the component will also be presented and correlated with those of forged components. *Research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC05-96ORT22464 with Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation.

MICROSTRUCTURAL AND TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES EVALUATION OF CHAR-REINFORCED Al-Si ALLOY COMPOSITES:</B> J.U. Ejiofor, R.G. Reddy, Department of 	Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, P.O. Box 870202, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487
<P>
The application of carbon-reinforced aluminum composites in electromechanics has continued to attract new research investigations. The factors of interest range from low cost and availability of materials to low-temperature processing methods. This study has investigated the conventional double-compaction, powder metallurgy processing of Al-13.5Si-2.5Mg alloy (wt.%) reinforced with coconut shell chars. The mechanical, physical and relevant tribological properties were determined after achieving the optimum compaction and sintering conditions. Use of optical microscopy, EPMA, SEM and energy dispersive analysis were made in characterising the matrix-reinforcement interfaces, the fracture surfaces and the nature of the adhesive dry wear. At 0.02Vf of the char, the alloy exhibited properties suitable for antifriction applications. Increased additions of the chars resulted in largely reduced strength, hardness and sintered density. This is attributed to poor bonding of the char particles with the matrix alloy. Parallel investigations with palm-kernel shell char as the filler phase yielded identical results. Initial formation of A14C3 in the composites was detected at a sintering temperature of 600&#176;C. Reinforcement of the alloy with chars activated in CO2 to various bum-off percentages were found to yield marginal results.

A NEW CASTING DEFECT HEALING TECHNOLOGY:</B> Edwin S. Hodge, Thomas W. Reddoch, Format Industries, Inc., Knoxville, TN; Srinath Viswanathan, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN
<P>
A new technology is presented for healing of defects in 356 and 201 Aluminum alloys that provides economic upgrading of these cast alloys. This technology uses pneumatic isostatic forging (PIF) to provide a unique capability to produce high quality Aluminum alloy products with enhanced mechanical properties that are uniform throughout the part thus permitting higher design allowables and increased usage of Aluminum alloy castings. The fundamental mechanism underlying PIF is a single mode plastic deformation process that uses isostatic application of pressures for 10 to 30 seconds at temperature. The process can be integrated in-line with other production operations, i.e., using the latent heat from the previous casting step. The results of applying the PIF process indicate lower cost and significant improvement in me chanical properties that rival and often exceed corresponding properties of other technologies like hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and related processes. This process offers many advantages that will be described in the paper in addition to presenting case histories of property enhancement by PIF, and the mechanism for responsible property enhancement.

TENSILE PROPERTIES OF 319 ALLOY CASTINGS: </B> S. Viswanathan, W. Ren, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Labs, Oak Ridge, TN 378316083, G.B. Ulrich, Y12 Plant, Oak Ridge, TN 378318096; M.E. Hoover, General Motors Powertrain Division, Saginaw, MI 486055073
<P>
Plate castings of 319 alloy were made over a wide range of thermal conditions by casting in sand molds, molds with end chills, and molds with top, bottom, and end chills. The plates were sectioned along their width into coupons. Odd-numbered coupons were machined into tensile specimens and tested in the as-cast condition. Even-numbered coupons were heat treated to a T6 condition, and then machined and tested. Yield strength, Ultimate tensile strength, and ductility measured by percent elongation were plotted with respect to distance from the chill end of the plate as well as related to porosity and other microstructural features such as dendrite cell spacing. The data shows that tensile elongation is a strong function of porosity. In particular, the data indicates a threshold value of porosity below which a sharp increase in ductility is observed. These effects as well as the effect of heat treatment and dendrite arm spacing are discussed. *Research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy Defense Programs, Assistant Secretary, Technology Management Group, Technology Transfer Initiative under contract DE-AC05-96OR22464 with Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SQUEEZE CASTING OF MAGNESIUM ALLOYS AND THEIR COMPOSITES</B>: Henry Hu, Alan Luo, Institute of Magnesium Technology (ITM, Inc., SteFoy, Quebec, Canada GIP 4N7
<P>
Squeeze casting, also known as liquid metal forging, extrusion casting and pressure crystallization, is a process in which molten metal solidifies in a die under an applied high pressure. The concept of squeeze casting was invented in Russia over 100 years ago. Later the process has been exploited in North America, Japan and Europe to produce various automotive components. With the rapid expansion of magnesium applications in the automotive industry, the development of squeeze casting technology for magnesium alloys and their composites has been motivated by incentive to produce high quality magnesium-based components. The present paper reviews recent progress in squeeze casting of magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites. The effects of process variables on the cast structure and properties of magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites are discussed. The significant advantages of squeeze cast magnesium alloys and magnesium-based composites are highlighted. The ongoing research work at ITM is presented.

CAST ALUMINUMFLY ASH COMPOSITES FOR ULTRALIGHT AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATION</B>: P.K. Rohatgi, R.Q. GUO, Department of Materials, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53211
<P>
Coal fly ash, an industrial waste by-product, is produced during combustion of coal by thermal power plants. Additions of solid or hollow particles of fly ash into aluminum melt by common foundry techniques reduce the cost and density of aluminum castings while increasing their performance. Fly ash particles are very light materials with density around 2.1 to 2.3 g/cm3 for solid fly ash particles and a density as low as 0.4 to 0.8 g/cm3 for the cenospheres of fly ash which are hollow. In this paper, manufacture and some properties of aluminum-fly ash composites (Ashalloy) have been studied. Aluminum alloy-fly ash (Ashalloy) represents a candidate ultralight material for automotive application. Incorporation of cenosphere fly ash particles, which are hollow with very low density, significantly reduces the density of material. Some of the characteristics of fly ash used for making composite have been described. The fly ash particle shape, size, and density have been determined. Mechanical properties of aluminum alloy - fly ash composites made by stir casting show that the composites have similar hardness, elastic modulus as matrix aluminum alloy, and improved wear abrasive resistance compared to the matrix alloy. Several prototype components of aluminum - fly ash composites for automotive applications, small engine and electromechanical machinery have been made and are under trials.

EFFECT OF SECTION THICKNESS AND GATE VELOCITY ON EVOLVED MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF HIGH PRESSURE DIE CAST MAGNESIUM ALLOY AZ91D: </B><I>Winston P. Sequeira</I>, Gordon L. Dunlop, CRC for Alloy and Solidification Technology (CAST), The University of Queenland, St. Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia, Morris T. Murray, CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology, Preston, Vic 3072, Australia
<P>
This paper investigates the change that occurs in microstructure and mechanical properties when the section thickness is varied for high pressure die cast Mg alloy AZ9lD. It has been found that yield and ultimate tensile strength increase more than would be expected with decreasing section thickness. This is explained in light of the fine microstructure in the surface layer (skin) that develops during the rapid solidification that occurs in this process. The two stage solidification sequence which leads to the evolution of the unique microstructure in die castings has been supported by evidence from solidification experiments using wedge castings and computer simulation of the shot sleeve. Two different die castings with relatively thick cross sections have been compared in terms of their porosity content and its effect on mechanical properties. Finally, the effects on mechanical properties of thick and thin specimens due to variation of casting parameters such as gate size is also discussed.

CORRELATION OF COKE PROPERTIES, ANODE PROPERTIES, AND CARBON CONSUMPTION: </B> <I>C.T. Leach</I>, D.G. Brooks, R.E. Gehlbach, Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, Reynolds Metals Company, 3326 East Second Street, Muscle Shoals, AL 35661-1258<P>
Researchers often use calcined coke and anode core properties to predict carbon consumption in aluminum reduction cells. This study compared laboratory analysis data and production data from 1992 through 1995 at RMC's Lake Charles Carbon Company and Baie Comeau Reduction Plant. During this period, carbon plant operations produced anodes with a range of properties using various calcined cokes. The results indicate that calcined cokes having a relatively wide range of properties can produce quality prebake anodes that yield low, stable carbon consumptions. Some coke and anode properties that are considered important quality parameters had little or no detrimental effect on carbon consumption. Correlations exist between certain coke and anode properties during time periods where the properties changed significantly.

The concentration of various metallic compounds in crude oils and in the resulting petroleum coke has continued an upward trend as crude reserves continue to change and tend toward being increasingly heavy and sour. Traditionally labeled as a catalyst, nickel has been included with vanadium in the evaluation of its effects on anode reactivity. In 1995, a Task Force was formed to quantify the influence of nickel on reduction cell anodes as existing information in the literature did not address specifically the affects of varying concentrations of nickel on anodes. The task force prepared resid with identical properties with the exception of nickel content. These resids were then coked, calcined, and formed into anodes in as identical a process as possible. Finally, the anodes were baked and tested to determine the effects on their performance characteristics. The results and conclusions drawn from this process will be communicated in this paper.

VIBRATED BULK DENSITY (VBD) MEASUREMENT OF CALCINED COKE AND BINDER CONTROL IN PREBAKED ANODE PASTE : A CASE STUDY: </B> <I>Luc Duchesneau</I>, Roland Lessard, Andr&eacute; Gendron and Germain Brassard, Alcan International Limited, Arvida Research &amp; Development Centre, 1955 Mellon Blvd, P.O. Box 1250, Jonqui&egrave;re, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G7S 4K8<P>
Vibrated bulk density is used to establish the binder content in prebaked anode paste. Alcan adopted the calcined coke VBD analytical method from Collier Carbon in 1961 with slight modifications. Recent paste quality problems (sticking in baking furnaces) were associated with a lack of precision in the VBD. The apparatus was identified as the main cause of imprecision (irregular flow when feeding the cylinder with the vibrating spatula, increase of table vibration amplitude over time and cylinder holding system) and an improved semi-automatic version was constructed. This communication describes the critical parts of the apparatus and their impact on the quality of the results. It also discusses calibration approach, analytical performance achieved (a four-fold improvement in reproducibility sigma = 0.003) and the impact on the paste production control.

PETROLEUM COKE DEOILING FOR PROPERTIES DETERMINATION:</B> <I>R.E. Gehlbach</I>, C.T. Leach, and V.A. Beno&icirc;t, Reynolds Metals Co., 3326 E. Second Street, Muscle Shoals, AL 35661-1258<P>
The presence of petroleum-based dedusting agents applied to calcined petroleum coke for control of fugitive dust precludes obtaining correct analytical results when certain tests are performed. Removal of various dedusting agents in commercial use is difficult and the process (es) employed may also affect the properties obtained. Results are presented for studies of thermal, solvent extraction, and vacuum deoiling methods and their effectiveness for several surface-sensitive tests. While all methods are observed to remove virtually all of the dedusting agents, different types of residues or decomposition products remain on the coke particles and adversely affect test results. Depending on the particular properties to be determined and the desired accuracy of the results, more than one technique may be required.

EFFECTS OF IRON AND SULPHUR ON THE AIR- AND CO2-REACTIVITY OF COKES: </B> <I>Trygve Eidet,</I> Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian Institute of Technology, Elkem ASA, Research, PO Box 8040 Vaagsbygd, N-4602 Kristiansand, Norway; Morten Sorlie, Elkem ASA, Research, PO Box 8040 Vaagsbygd, N-4602 Kristiansand, Norway; Jomar Thonstad, Department of Electrochemistry, Norwegian Institute of Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway<P>
The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of inorganic impurities on the reactivity of cokes and anode materials and at the same time to avoid the uncertainties that are introduced by the often complex background impurity content in industrial anode cokes. An aromatic distillate fraction from the production of coal tar pitch was used as coke precursor and cokes with controlled amounts of impurities were produced in a laboratory coker. Iron was added to the coke precursor as iron (III) acetylacetonate, and sulphur as dibenzothiophene. These organic substances dissolve in the precursor. The effects of iron and sulphur on the reactivities of cokes were measured in air at 500&#176;C and in CO2 at 960&#176;C. Surface studies (SEM, EDX) showed the topography of the surface, what iron phases were present and indicated the impact of iron and sulphur on the reaction.

TRACKING THE CARBONISATION PATHWAY OF DIFFERENT PITCHES AND PITCH COKE MIXTURES BY CRYSTALLITE HEIGHT (Lc) MEASUREMENT</B>: <I>N.R. Turner</I>, Bitmac Limited, Scunthorpe Works, Dawes Lane, Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, DN15 6UR, UK
<P>
Pitches with a range of properties, e.g. Q.I. content, were carbonised to a final temperature of 1080&#176;C. The same pitches were co-carbonised with finely divided petroleum coke. Lc has been measured at the end of the carbonisation cycles and at intermediate points to track the status of carbonisation for different pitches and pitch/filler coke combinations. The original pitch Q.I. content and pitch aromaticity appear to influence the carbonisation pathway of the pitch and the pitch-coke mixtures according to Lc data. The properties of the filler coke also appear to influence the ultimate size of the crystallites formed in the binder matrix at the end of the carbonisation cycle. It appears that there is a variable degree of interaction between the filler coke and the pitch, with extent of the interaction depending on the properties of the two components. The results so far reinforce the importance of consistency in raw materials preparation and in the baking process if uniform anodes are to be produced.

ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN FROM AIR INTO COAL TAR PITCH</B>: <I>Jaromir Cibulec</I>, Daniel Kostal, DEZA Corporation, P.O. Box 28, 757 28 Valasske Mezirici, Czech Republic
<P>
Changes in the properties of coal tar pitch during contact with atmospheric oxygen were studied. There were found to be changes in the content of toluene insolubles and the melting point. These changes are dependent on the quantity of the absorbed oxygen and on the temperature of the pitch during absorption. As the reaction of the air with the pitch is very rapid, reaction speed is controlled by the speed of absorption of oxygen into the pitch. When surface of the pitch is motionless, the rate determining step of the reaction is controlled by the rate of absorption of the oxygen into the pitch which is dependent on the diffusion coefficient of molecular oxygen in air. When the surface of the pitch is agitated, the reaction rate is controlled by the rate of reaction of the oxygen with the pitch. The mechanism of the reaction is described and a practical application is discussed.

<P>
The carbonization has important impacts on the energy consumption and the productivity in anode baking. It was found that the coke yield of the coal tar pitch binder in its mixtures with petroleum coke increased with addition of catalysts, such as S, AlF3, and FeCp2 (CO)4. Then the structures of the samples taken from the carbon pilot anodes with and without above additions were further investigated using X-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques. The remained S, Al and Fe in the carbons after heat treatments were also analysed. The coke yield, Lc value, and porosity will be presented against various heat treatment temperatures for different additions. The possibility of obtaining the carbon anodes by lower baking temperatures with the required structure will be discussed based on above results.

COAL-TAR/PETRO INDUSTRIAL PITCHES:</B> <I>E.R. McHenry</I>, Koppers Industries, 1005 Wm. Pitt Way, Pittsburgh, PA 15238
<P>
Throughout the 20th Century coal tar has been the dominant raw material for producing industrial pitches in North America. However, the coal tar supply in North America has been decreasing due to closure of metallurgical and foundry coke-oven batteries. Because of lower carbon yield, petroleum-based pitches have only limited usage. To increase the raw material base and provide more flexibility in characteristics, coal tar/petro pitches are being developed. The evaluation of the coal-tar/petro industrial pitches is reported.

<P>
A petroleum pitch, specially developed for aluminum anodes was produced, at commercial scale, as a real alternative to coal tar pitch. Using a highly aromatic refinery stream and well designed process conditions, it is possible to produce the right chemical composition needed for a high quality binder material for anodes. Through a Dynamic Process Optimization study, the paste formulation and parameters were adjusted to produce full size anodes with 100 % petroleum pitch. The performance of baked anodes were similar to coal tar pitch anodes, with the advantage of a much lower content of cancerogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH). Comparative green and baked anode properties, PAH emissions and storage stability test for molten pitch are presented.

<P>
Petroleum pitch as binder material of anodes has the great advantage, that the content of cancerogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) compared to coal tar pitch is practically inexistent. In applying the correct content of pitch and through optimization of all process parameters during anode manufacturing, full size anodes with coal tar pitch (CTP) and petroleum pitch (PP) have been prepared in an anode plant. While baked anode properties for coal tar and petroleum pitch anodes are very similar, the PAH content can be reduced by 98 %. In this paper the behavior of representative lots of coal tar and petroleum pitch anodes in 100 kA electrolysis cells and the properties of the resulting anode butts will be described.

TESTS OF PITCH PRODUCED FROM THE MIXTURE OF COAL RESIN AND REMAINDERS AFTER</B> <B>OIL PYROLYSIS</B>: <I>M.L. Itskov,</I> E.A. Yanko, Russian National Aluminium-Magn&eacute;sium Institute (VAMI), 199026 St. Petersburg, Russia; V.V. Krukov, Central Investigations Laboratory, 101000, Moscow, Russia
<P>
Actually the main type of binding materials, used in the anode paste production is a coal tar pitch. This binder provides the necessary quality of anode, but its using is related to increased emissions of cancerogenous matters, especially, benzapyrene, into the anode paste and aluminium reduction plants. The cancerogenous danger could be considerably reduced if using, as a binding material in the anode paste production, pitch produced at the distillation of the mixture of coal resin and remainders after oil pyrolysis, called &quot;modified pitch&quot;. This report gives the results of laboratory investigations and industrial tests of anode paste, produced with using above mentioned binder, in the aluminium reduction. The laboratory investigations and industrial tests on Soderberg pots have shown, that by using the modified pitch we succeeded to produce anode paste of satisfactory quality. In this case we achieve a considerable reducing of the emissions of cancerogenous matters, namely benzapyrene, from the surface of anode.

GREEN PASTE POROSITY AS AN INDICATOR OF MIXING EFFICIENCY</B>: <I>Per Stokka</I>, Norsk Hydro Research Centre, N-3901 Porsgrunn, Norway
<P>
Variations in green paste porosity were studied as a function of pitch content and mixing parameters. Porosity in paste from paste plants operating with different mixing systems, was measured and used to indicate the efficiency of the mixing. Changes in paste porosity during remixing in the laboratory were also studied.

POTENTIALITIES IN THE PASTE PLANT</B>: <I>S. Wilkening</I>, VAW Aluminium-Technologie GmbH, P.O. Box 2468, 53114 Bonn, Germany
<P>
Over the last decade much progress in paste plant technology originated from computerized process control, improved process philosophy and P &amp; ID's as well as full level 2 operation. This paper will focus on materials aspects to get out more from the intrinsic properties of coke and pitch. Proposals will be made how to utilize in a better way the structural properties of petroleum coke and the fluid and carbonization properties of binder pitch. Potential changes in equipment and lay-out will also be discussed.

VERTICAL ANODE CRACKING - THE VALCO EXPERIENCE</B>: <I>Norbert A. Ambenne</I>, Volta Alumium Company Ltd (VALCO), P.O. Box 625, Tema, Ghana, West Africa
<P>
During the period 1990 - 1995 the VALCO aluminum smelter experienced a serious anode cracking problem. Approximately 12 % of the anodes split mainly along a particular set of anode stubs. About half of these splits resulted in carbon pieces falling into the reduction cell with attendant operating difficulties. This cracking phenomenon started when the plant was converted from 41.5 to 48 inches longer anodes with the extra length added to one end of the anode. Results of the investigations revealed that several operating variables contributed to anode cracking in varying degrees. These factors include mix profile in anode former mold, anode stub-to-gap ratio, anode setting practices, pot condition, anode symmetry, and moisture content in anode aggregate. This paper discusses these factors and how they affected anode cracking at Valco.

AN APPROACH FOR A COMPLETE EVALUATION OF RESISTANCE OF A MATERIAL TO THERMAL SHOCK (PART 1): APPLYING TO THE CASES OF ANODES AND CATHODES: </B><I>Christian Dreyer</I>, Bernard Samanos, Aluminium Pechiney, LRF BP 114, 73303 Saint Jean de Maurienne, Cedex, France
<P>
The aim of this article is to describe a new method for characterizing a material in terms of resistance to thermal shock. Such characterization takes into account the criteria of thermal shock resistance to initiation (Kingery criterion) and propagation (Hasselman criteria). It can be applied equally well to hard or soft thermal shock. This new approach has the following main advantages : 1) characterization of the material in terms of thermal shock is complete, 2) thermal shock tests or empirical formulae, the validity of which are often hard to establish, become unnecessary. Examples of the use of this new approach are presented for anodes and cathodes.

AN APPROACH FOR A COMPLETE EVALUATION OF RESISTANCE OF A MATERIAL TO THERMAL SHOCK (PART 2): APPLYING TO AN INDUSTRIAL PROBLEM AT ALBA</B>: <I>Bernard Samanos</I>, Christian Dreyer, Aluminium Pechiney, LRF BP 114, 73303 Saint Jean de Maurienne Cedex, France; A. Hameed, G. Abbas, Jaffar G. Ameeri, Aluminium Bahrain, 570 Manama, Bahrain
<P>
This article presents in detail the steps taken to successfully resolve the problem of anode breakage due to thermal shock et ALBA. These steps can be essentially characterized as follows: 1) establishment of a method of accounting for anode breakages, 2) parametric studies on benchscale anodes, 3) effects on the process. Characterizing anodes in terms of resistance to thermal shock, following the method described in Part 1, allowed us to appreciate the importance of each of the adjustable parameters of the process. The applied solution draws on a new grain size distribution formulation.

ANODE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT DURING HEAT TREATMENT</B>: <I>Mona Jacobsen</I>, Department of Thermal Energy and Hydro Power, the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; Oyvind Gundersen, Department of Engineering Cybernetics, The Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Change of weight, density, permeability and porosity of anode specimens were measured after being baked to temperatures between 300 and 1250&#176;C. Test specimens were cut from a green anode and analysed prior to the baking to study green property variations. Density variations in the green anode were significant and influenced the permeability measured in the green specimens. In mathematical modeling of the baking process, anode property models for description of heat and mass transport phenomena in the anodes are required. As basis for the derivation of the property models, the anode was considered to be a composite medium consisting of pitch coke, filler coke and pores. The filler coke was divided into a coarse and fine size fraction. The fine fraction mix with the binder pitch to constitute the binder matrix. It was assumed that the binder matrix was uniformly distributed on the surface of the remaining coarse filler particles. The models were compared and verified against the data.

ANODE IMPREGNATION SYSTEM FOR ALUMINIUM REDUCTION CELLS: </B><I>Georges Berclaz</I>, Avenue St-Fran&ccedil;ois, 3968 Veyras/Sierre, Switzerland; Vittorio de Nora, Jean-Jacques Duruz, Gaynor Johnston, MOLTECH, 9 Route de Troinex, CH 1227 Carouge-Geneva, Switzerland
<P>
The minimization of anode carbon consumption in aluminium reduction cells has an important technical, environmental and economical impact. The basic anode elements, such as coke and pitch, do not always have the desired properties and there is an increasing need to protect the anodes against oxidation by air and CO2. A solution based on boric acid impregnation of the upper part of the anode has been tested at the industrial scale. Anodes have been impregnated using specially designed equipment to place the protection in the appropriate part of the anode and to avoid metal contamination. Results are shown for different levels of impregnation. Comparison to metal spraying protection is also analyzed.

BUTTS CLEANING AT SLOVALCO IMPLEMENTED BY TECHMO</B>: <I>J. Ifju</I>, F. Zannini, F. Marchetti, M. Fontolan, Techmo Car S.P.A., Via R. Colpi, 15/17 35010 Limena (PD) Italy
<P>
The best use of anode carbon and bath materials withdrawn from the smelting process by anode changing involves their recycling. In order to provide optimal composition of recycled carbon and bath, a butt cleaning technology is required with the aim to avoid their contamination by each other. A technology and equipment has been elaborated for implementing above objective. Some optimization was fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the new aluminium smelter implemented by Hydro Aluminium technology, taking into account very tough requirements to the material quality, as well as fitting a piece of equipment into the technology flowsheet planned.

DUST CONTROL TECHNOLOGY FOR ANODE BUTT RECYCLING</B>: <I>Nathalie Perreault,</I> Betz Water Management Group, Casier Postal 232, Baie Comeau, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G4Z 2G9; Eric Grondin, Engineering Environment and Water Treatment, Reynolds Metals, 100 route Maritine, Baie Comeau, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G4Z 2H7<P>
There are several dust control problems in the Aluminium industry, amongst them is the process of recycling anode butts. In general, prior to being recycled, the butts are cleaned, taken off the hexapod rods and stored and/or shipped to be processed as new anodes. A particular area of concern for fugitive dust during the anode preparation process is anode butt stripping inside the anode rodding room. This process generates a lot of carbon dust. It has been both a health and safety issue, as well as cleaning burden for operating personnel. This paper presents different alternatives, both mechanical and chemical, for controlling fugitive dust, and a decision process for using chemical treatment. In addition, the theory behind the chemical application and a case history will also be presented.

EFFICIENT ANODE-COLLAR CAST IRON MICROSTRUCTURE</B>: <I>Michael Barstow</I>, 1152 Southvale Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15237<P>
Cast iron is used to secure the steel stub of an anode rod to a carbon block for aluminum reduction cells. The quality is measured by the millivoltage drop across the stub-carbon interface. The electrical resistivity of cast iron varies with it's microstructure, which changes with temperature. Cast iron cannot be simply specified by analysis since it is section sensitive, and the microstructure is affected by minor elements, time, and rate of cooling. If the metallurgical control is limited, collars will develop variable electrical efficiencies. Recycling cast iron callors also causes a change inthe minor element analysis (S,P) which will change the microstructure / electrical resistivity. A cast iron designed for optimum fluidity with low level minor elements will provide lower electrical resistance than one with buildup of Mn, S. Other melting efficiencies are predicted.

AUTOMATIC STUB STRAIGHTENING SYSTEM:</B> <I>J&ograve;n Hjaltalin Magnusson, </I>ALTECH Ltd., Borgartun 18, 105 Reykjavik, Iceland; William Cannon, Portland Aluminium Ltd., Portland, Victoria 3305, Australia<P>
For improving the economy and environment aluminium smelters have increased the automation of diverse tasks. An automatic system has been developed for the task of straightening anode rod stubs instead of cutting them off the rod yoke and welding new onto the yoke. The stub toe-in problem cannot be eliminated, but significant degree of control can be implemented to eliminate its adverse effects and increase the useful life of the stubs and reduce the considerable cost of reparation and stub material. This paper describes the cause of the stub bending in the electrolitic cells together with the details of the new automatic stub straightening system based on preheating the stubs with induction heating coils prior to straightening in a hydraulic cylinder press. Implementation of this straightening system at Portland Aluminium in Australia is also described, where the system was installed in February 1996. The system is installed &quot;in-line&quot; in the P&amp;F overhead monorail and the bending of the stubs is measured automatically for deciding if the straightening is required or not. It will be shown how this system improves the useful life of the stubs leading to significant operational savings for the smelter.

ECA FOR IMPROVED CATHODE PERFORMANCE</B>: <I>Johan A. Johansen, </I>Herman Gran, Elkem Carbon, P.O. Box 8040, Vagsbygd, N-4602 Kristiansand, Norway
<P>
ECA (Electrically Calcined Anthracite) is the main raw material for the carbon part of the electrolysis cells. Demand for increased potlife and more efficient cathodes (lower voltage drop) have led to use of more graphite in the carbon materials. Little has been done to improve the main raw material, ECA. The characteristics of ECA can be strongly affected by calcining conditions and selection of raw anthracites. In this study, different ECA qualities were produced in full scale calciners and the effect of improved ECA quality on cathode materials studied. A lab scale test program was established to evaluate the effect on different baked properties. Important properties for improved cathode performance, like sodium resistance, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, can be effected by use of selected ECA.

HIGH PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PREPARATION OF CARBON PASTE FOR</B> <B>CATHODES AND GRAPHITE ELECTRODES</B>: <I>Berthold Hohl</I>, Machinenfabrik Gustav Eirich, D-74732 Hardheim, Federal Republic of Germany
<P>
The preparation of carbon paste for manufacture of cathodes and graphite electrodes requires the heating-up of the raw materials as well as the following mixing and cooling of the paste. In the last few years, a newly developed plant type has proved successful in practical operation. It consists mainly of an electric resistance heater and a high-performance mixer. The coke fractions are heated up to temperatures between 150-200&#176;C by the resistance heater and fed into the high-performance mixer along with liquid pitch. After completed homogenization of the components, the temperature required for the moulding is achieved with greatest accuracy by addition of water and evaporation cooling. One single machine of this type replaces 8-12 conventional batch mixers. The special merits of this process are the minimal maintenance compared to conventional techniques, the reduced energy consumption, the shortened cycle time and the considerably improved environmental protection. The plant is a closed system; dusts and steams are purified in an exhaust air decontamination plant and partially reused. The plant flexibility makes it possible to prepare carbon paste for both cathodes and graphite electrodes with exactly the same equipment by only simply changing the recipe. As an example, the latest state of the art is presented as well as the most significant operating results by means of a plant which was commissioned in 1995 at a great international manufacturer of carbon and graphite products.

THE OXIDATION OF HETEROGENEOUS CARBON ELECTRODES AND FURNACE LINERS--PART 1: X-RAY DIFFRACTION APPLICATIONS</B>: <I>F. Hiltmann</I>, SGL Carbon AG, Frankfurt-Griesheim, Germany; B.J. James, B.J. Welch, M.M. Hyland, Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, The University of Auckland, New Zealand
<P>
The primary purpose of this study is to fully understand the role played by oxidation reactions in the degradation of carbon cathodes and furnace liners such as those used in aluminium smelting cells. While we have developed a sensitive technique for detecting oxidation at low rates, full mechanistic understanding is dependent on supplementary characterisation of the residual unreacted materials. This is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the electrode materials. This paper presents details of the application of X-ray diffraction for studying the various component materials of these composites, namely pitch, graphite and anthracite. Also presented in this paper is supporting compositional analysis of the heterogeneous carbon samples together with element maps to indicate the distribution of typical trace elements.

THE OXIDATION OF HETEROGENEOUS CARBON ELECTRODES AND FURNACE LINERS--PART II: OVERALL REACTIVITY CORRELATIONS:</B> <I>B.J. James</I>, B.J. Welch, M.M. Hyland, Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, the University of Auckland, New Zealand; F. Hiltmann, SGL Carbon AG, Frankfurt-Griesheim, Germany
<P>
Using the method described previously (Light Metals, 1996) the oxidation reactions of carbon cathode materials have been characterised for onset temperature and rate of oxidation at low (less than 550&#176;C) temperatures. Combining the results of composition and structural analysis described in Part I, correlations have been made between the inherent structure of the component materials and their onset temperature and relative rates of oxidation thus explaining the preferential nature observed in the oxidation of composite samples. Using the results of polarised light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy the relationship between bulk structure of the heterogeneous samples and their oxidation reactions has been examined with important implications for the performance of these materials in service.

<P>
Many different types of furnaces are used in aluminum industry for melting and treating the metal. Sidewell furnaces are commonly used for scrap melting. Metal flow in the furnace is provided by different types of equipment such as pumps and impellers, and plays an important role in furnace performance. A three-dimensional model has been developed to simulate the metal flow in such furnaces. In this paper, the model will be described, and the results will be presented showing how various operating and design parameters such as impeller position and rotational speed, sidewell geometry and arch design affect the metal flow.

A series of laboratory tests were conducted to explore the reaction of bath with Al-Mg alloys, as may occur when Hall bath enters ingot furnaces in a smelter-supplied ingot plant. Results showed that Mg clearly reacts with bath and adds Na and Ca to the metal by the reactions: 2(Na3AlF6) + 3 <U>Mg</U> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"> 6 <U>Na</U> + 2 AlF3 + 3 MgF2 (1) and CaF2 + <U>Mg</U> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"> <U>Ca</U> + MgF2 (2) Temperature, Mg concentration in the alloy, the quantity of bath added to the metal, and the particle size of the bath added all influenced the reaction. At 700&#176;C the Na and Ca pick-ups that occurred from these reactions were approximately 15 ppm while at 900&#176;C the pick-ups were greater than 300 ppm. The pick-ups increased with increasing quantity of bath up to a limiting amount, beyond which no further pick-up occurred. The variation of the reaction with particle size indicated that the reaction is limited by the available bath-metal surface area.

<P>EFFECTS OF SOLUTE INTERACTIONS ON GRAIN REFINEMENT OF COMMERCIAL ALUMINIUM ALLOYS: </B>M.A. Kearns, <I>P.S. Cooper</I>, London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co. Limited, Fullerton Road, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, S60 1DL, England
<P>
An analysis of the effects of alloy additions on the grain refinement in a 
series of model and commercial aluminium alloy compositions is reported. The 
data of Birch and Fisher published earlier describing grain refinement in 32 
systems, including AA3004, AA5083, AA6063 and AA7050, are considered 
in terms of the supercooling effect of each alloy addition. A simple model 
describing grain size in terms of additive supercooling effects of individual 
alloy additions is proposed which fits the data reasonably well. Deviations 
from simple additive behaviour are evident in systems where strong 
intermetallic interactions occur. Interaction coefficients amongst solutes are invoked 
to explain these deviations. Individual alloying effects on grain refinement 
are treated in terms of constitutional supercooling parameters and behaviour 
is shown to be similar to that described in earlier studies. Zirconium is shown 
to have a general poisoning effect in a range of alloy compositions.

<P>THE BUBBLE SIZE AND MASS TRANSFER MECHANISMS IN ROTOR STIRRED REACTORS: </B><I>Stein Tore Johansen</I>, Svend Gr&aring;dahl, Per Ola Gr&oslash;ntvedt, P&aring;l Tetlie, Rune Gammels&aelig;ter, SINTEF Materials Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; Karl Ven&aring;s, Pal Skaret, Karl Ven&aring;s a.s., Trondheim, Norway; Erling Myrbostad, Bj&oslash;rn Rasch, Hydro Aluminium a.s R&amp;D Centre, N-6600 Sunndals&oslash;ra, Norway
<P>
The performance characteristics of the HYCAST Rotor has been 
investigated in a water model. The removal rate of oxygen from water is measured for 
a large number of operational conditions. By combining different 
techniques the energy dissipation in the reactor, the mass transfer at the top surface 
and the bubble sizes may be determined experimentally. Investigations of 
the bubble dynamics by high speed video show that the bubbles in this type 
of reactors are very different from what is hitherto believed. Based on such 
a picture the paper demonstrates that the mass transfer and bubble sizes in 
the HYCAST Unit may be explained by a relatively simple theory which 
seems to explain all available experimental data. It is also demonstrated how 
we from this theory can scale from the oxygen removal in water model to 
hydrogen removal in liquid aluminum.

<P>MODELLING OF SURFACE SEGREGATION DEVELOPMENT DURING D.C. CASTING OF ROLLING SLAB INGOTS:</B> <I>A. Mo</I>, H.J. Thevik, SINTEF Materials Technology, Box 124 Blindern, N-0314 Oslo, Norway; B.R. Henriksen, E.K .Jensen, Elkem Research, Box 40, N-4602 
Kristiansand, Norway
<P>
A two dimensional mathematical model for the development 
of macrosegregation at and close to the ingot surface during DC casting of 
rolling slabs is presented. The model accounts for macrosegregation caused 
by exudation of interdendritic melt and macrosegregation associated with 
solidification shrinkage. Equations for the conservation of energy, solute, 
momentum, and mass during the stationary phase of the process are solved 
numerically by a finite element method in a solution domain defined by a 
vertical cross section of the ingot. The main simplifications in the modelling 
concept are to assume the solidified part of the mushy zone to move with 
the casting speed, and to consider a binary alloy solidifying according to the 
lever rule. The thickness and solute concentration of the surface layer and 
the macrosegregation close to the surface are calculated, and modelling 
results are compared with measurements on real castings.

<P>A MODEL TO PREDICT THE STEADY STATE PULL-IN DURING D.C.-CASTING OF ALUMINIUM SHEET INGOTS:</B> <I>Arild H&aring;konsen</I>, Hydro Aluminium R&amp;D Materials Technology, P.O.Box 219, N-6601 Sunndals&oslash;ra, Norway
<P>
By combining empirical results with a dimensional analysis, a model for the prediction of pull-in during DC-casting of aluminium sheet ingots is constructed. The model predicts the steady state pull-in along the rolling faces of an ingot. By using an alloy dependent constant, the nominal geometry and the casting speed, the model can easily calculate a near optimal mould shape. It is also possible to calculate the resulting shape of the rolling faces of an ingot for a given mould geometry, alloy constant and casting speed. The model requires only a spread sheet for these calculations. Comparisons with experiments show a very good agreement. The best fit values of the alloy constant for several commercial aluminium alloys are presented. The value of this constant varies within 12%.

<P>THE MECHANISM OF PULL-IN DURING D.C.-CASTING OF ALUMINIUM SHEET INGOTS:</B> <I>Hallvard G.Fj&aelig;r</I>, Institute for Energy Technology, P.O. Box 40, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway; Arild H&aring;konsen, Hydro Aluminium R&amp;D Materials Technology, P.O. Box 219, N-6601 Sunndals&oslash;ra, Norway
<P>
The pull-in phenomenon apparent in the DC-casting process of aluminium sheet ingots is investigated both analytically and by use of numerical models calculating temperatures, strains and stresses. The major part of the pull-in takes place above the bottom of the sump, but is mainly caused by thermal contractions and deformations in regions below. The strong and almost exactly linear dependency of the pull-in on the casting speed is explained. The effects on the pull-in of different cooling conditions and of various thermophysical and thermomechanical properties are investigated. 2D plain strain approximations have been successfully applied in calculating the pull-in for the centre part of the rolling face, but 3D effects are significant close to the narrow ingot surface. This is illustrated by comparison of results from 3D and 2D calculations. Modelling results are also compared with measurements of ingot thickness variations. A very good agreement is obtained.

<P>WATER COOLING IN DIRECT CHILL CASTING: PART 1: BOILING THEORY AND CONTROL:</B> John Grandfield, Comalco Research Centre, P.O.Box 316, Thomastown, Victoria 3074, Australia
<P>
The intensity of the water cooling in direct chill casting affects the process heat flow and the performance of the casting process. The intensity depends on the boiling behaviour on the ingot surface. The basic mechanisms of boiling, the different boiling modes (nucleate, unstable film and stable film boiling), the effect of water composition, temperature, flow and velocity on boiling behaviour and heat transfer are reviewed. A new method for measuring the heat transfer coefficients has been developed and some new results on the effect of water composition and temperature are presented together with results from inverse calculations based on insitu measurements during casting.

<P>A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO WATER COOLING IN DC CASTING:</B> <I>B. Magnin</I>, L. Maenner, Y. Caratini, Pechiney Centre de Recherches de Voreppe, BP27, F-38340 Voreppe, France
<P>
The numerical simulation of DC casting requires a good knowledge of the heat transfer between ingot and cooling water. This is especially true for the starting phase, where most defects are initiated. An experimental set-up has been developed to characterize this heat exchange close to process operating conditions. The method is based on the measurement of the cooling of a preheated instrumented aluminium block quenched by a water curtain. A 2D transient inverse model allows to determine the distribution of heat transfer coefficient and temperature on the whole surface of the block. In this way, heat flux can be assessed both at the water impingement point and below. The results obtained with the experimental apparatus are in good agreement with heat transfer rates calculated from in-situ temperature measurements using cast-in thermocouples. This device is thus an efficient and economical method to determine the influence of cooling water characteristics on the law describing heat transfer coefficient as a function of surface temperature. These laws have been measured and introduced in a numerical simulation of DC casting in order to study the effect of water cooling and casting parameters on the thermal evolution of the ingot during the different phases of casting.

<P>FUNDAMENTALS OF UBC DECOATING/DELAQUERING FOR EFFICIENT MELTING:</B> <I>Wesley Stevens</I>, Francois Tremblay, Arvida Research and Development Centre, Alcan International Limited, 1955 Mellon Blvd., Jonqui&egrave;re, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G7S 4K8
<P>
Aluminum used beverage cans (UBC) should be cleaned to completely remove all organic and residues to maximize metal recovery on remelting. This process must also minimize oxide formation. The aluminum industry uses three principal decoating technologies. The most used is the rotary kiln. The other processes are the belt decoater and the fluidized bed decoater. The presentation will cover the fundamental science for decoating shredded UBC to minimize metal loss on remelting. Laboratory work and plant trials have shown the requirements for complete decoating. These are: correct temperature range for the coatings to be pyrolized, good process gas to shred contact for all the scrap, sufficient oxygen being present to complete the oxidation of the carbon compounds present. The basic principles of the three decoating technologies used for the decoating of UBC will be discussed in relation to how they correspond to the fundamental process requirements.

<P>REFRACTORY SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO OVERCOME CORUNDUM GROWTH IN ALUMINIUM FURNACES: </B><I>Duncan Jones</I>, Morganite Thermal Ceramics Ltd., Liverpool Road, Neston, South Wirral, L64 3RE, England
<P>
<P>Corundum is an extremely hard, high temperature form of aluminium oxide. Its formation in aluminium melting furnaces and metal treatment units can lead to a reduction in operating efficiency and premature failure of the furnace lining. The formation of corundum is known to be dependent on several factors, including furnace atmosphere, operating temperature, alloy composition and refractory type. The paper describes solutions to this phenomenon identifying its cause and effect whilst highlighting refractory design criteria. Results from an extensive testing programme, classifying resistance to corundum growth against various qualities of refractory product are discussed.

USE OF SMALL DIAMETER IMMERSION HEATERS IN MOLTEN ALUMINUM:</B> <I>Mark Palmer</I>, Pyrotek Inc., E.9503 Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA; Andre Teytu, Atherm, Rue de Moirind 13, 38420 Domene, France
<P>
Small diameter electric immersion heaters offer unique benefits when used in molten aluminum heating applications. The 1&quot; diameter heaters allow greater flexibility in vessel design than traditional immersion heating systems. The electric heating elements are inside a Sialon sheath, which is non-wedded by molten aluminum and offers long life. Since the development of these heaters, they are being used in many different types of molten aluminium holding vessels. Pechiney Aluminium Engineering utilizes these small heaters in Alpur degassing vessels and the Pechiney Deep Bed Filter Heaters are also used in die casting holding furnaces for both primary and supplemental heating applications. The net result of using the small immersion heaters is high metal heat-up rates, compact vessel designs, energy savings, uniform metal temperatures, and user friendly equipment designs. The paper describes the capabilities of the heaters, the design flexibility they allow, and performance results obtained from initial installations.

Sidewell furnaces have long been operated for scrap melting, including UBC. The paper discusses important criteria for the optimum energy and melt rate performances for these types of furnaces. Intensive work has been done in several Alcan recycling installations in order to increase these furnace performances. Several operating parameters are outlined combined with the importance of melt stirring in the main hearth and in the sidewell. Mathematical and physical modeling provided key elements responsible for better furnace operation. The impact and advantages of the improved melt stirring and furnace operation are explained and discussed in detail.

CAST HOUSE WATER TREATMENT WITH AEC TECHNOLOGY: </B><I>Ed Grodecki</I>, Betz Water Management Group, 4150 Washington Road, Bldg.2, Suite 206, McMurray, PA 15317
<P>
<P>Cast house water treatment programs typically use organic phosphates to control both corrosion and deposition. These materials can break down or revert into inorganic phosphates in the presence of heat, long retention times and oxidizing biocides. The consequence of this reversion is the loss of calcium carbonate deposit control and an increase in the potential for forming inorganic phosphate deposits. Both situations would result in poor heat removal at the critical heat transfer surfaces. With the advent of the AEC molecule, cast house water treatment technology has taken a new step in controlling corrosion and scaling. The AEC molecule does not contain phosphate and does not break down in the presence of oxidizing biocides. It also has good thermal stability and does not degrade over time. Used in place of an organic phosphate, AEC will provide excellent calcium carbonate scale control without the risk of phosphate deposition. This paper studies a case history of one such application on a billet caster.

<P>
<P>For forty years, the Aluminum Industry has conducted and sponsored investigations directed at establishing a better understanding of the safety aspects associated with the sometimes explosive occurrence which may happen when there is a physical contact between molten aluminim and water. Industry concern has resulted in a poling of resources among companies, associations, and technical organizations. There has been a substantial funding of investigative projects conducted by capable research organizations employing sophisticated techniques. While useful information has been gained and translated into operational procedures, the basic cause remains elusive. A completely different, and additional, investigative approach is suggested based on cumulative experience and observation of daily occurrences. This can provide the informational basis to alleviate the safety and liability concerns associated with direct contact between molten aluminum and water.

<P>
<P>Traditionally industrial twin roll casters have been operated at gauges 6-7 mm, depending on the type of caster and the final product requirements. Over the past few years it has become apparent that a significant increase in productivity can be achieved when the casting gauge is reduced. Hydro Aluminium embarked on an extensive R &amp; D thin gauge casting program in the beginning of the 1990's, and this paper presents results of a five year lasting project (joint program between Hydro Aluminium and Lauener Engineering). Based on over 400 casting trials the major benefits and limitations of casting at reduced gauge and increased speed are outlined. Important aspects for product quality are discussed including: cooling rates and dendrite structure, microstructural characteristics (as-cast grain structure and texture), segregation behaviour, surface quality and mechanical properties after thermomechanical processing. Results for casting of several alloys (including the 5xxx and 8xxx-system) are given. Additionally, numerical modelling results of the strip casting process are included.

<P>MAGNETIC EDGE DAMS IN A TWIN ROLL ALUMINIUM CASTER: </B>Craig Anderson, Peter Davidson, Engineering Department, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 1P2, United Kingdom
<P>
In the twin roll casting process, molten aluminium is fed between two cooled rotating rollers where it cools, solidifies and is carried by roller rotation to the nip, where it is compressed to a single sheet and expelled. To prevent aluminium escaping laterally, from the roller edges, dams are required. Physical edge dams are subject to erosion from the rollers and molten metal and require maintenance and replacement. Hence there is a strong economic case for using magnetic edge dams, where the interaction of a magnetic field and a current provide sufficient repulsive force to contain the molten aluminium, which do not physically touch either the rollers or molten metal and require little or no maintenance. This paper discusses the theory behind high frequency magnetic edge dams and describes the design and construction of a practical system. Laboratory testing of the magnetic edge dam system is shown to give good agreement with theory and the installation and operation of the system on an experimental twin roll caster is described.

DECOATING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY: </B><I>O.H. Perry</I>, Stein Atkinson Stordy Ltd., Midland House, Ounsdale Road, Wombourne, Wolverhampton WV5 8BY, England
<P>
The technology for recycling aluminium scrap has evolved over a number of years through five major changes as follows: direct charging, side bay melter with puddlers, rotary furnaces, shredding and flat belt delacquering machines, shredding and rotary kilns, today it is now possible to fully decoat any aluminium material which can be shredded. With the invention of IDEX&#174; rotary kiln systems all materials from UBC, extrusions, coated foils, through to 6 micron aseptic foils can be successfully reclaimed and either remelted or processed with minimal metal loss. During 1996 three systems have been commissioned in the Americas for decoating materials which contain 3 to 80% VOC by weight and ranging from 4 to 7 tonnes per hour. This paper discusses the changing technology and the current &quot;state of the art&quot; in rotary kiln technology.

AlTiB GRAIN REFINER - THE CONSISTENT INGREDIENT: </B> <I>P.C. van Wiggen</I>, KBM Master Alloys<P>
The use of AlTiB grain refiners for a precise control of the metallurgical cast structure has become an integral requirement in the manufacture of present day products. A permanent high standard in the quality and consistency of grain refiners is essential especially when considering their radical impact on the production result. This paper will discuss the consistency of grain refiners in terms of the composition, the production route and the required grain refiner properties. Particular attention will be given to an in-depth comprehension of the AlTiB microstructure. The above will be illustrated by microstructures and further supported by a selection of SPC data, process capabilities and (particle) distribution figures taken from various grain refiners. Information concerning recent advancements in the characterisation and process development of AlTiB grain refiners will also be incorporated in this paper.

EFFECTS OF TRANSITION METALS ON THE POTENCY OF TiBAl GRAIN REFINERS: </B> A. Green, <I>M.A. Kearns</I>, London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co. Ltd., Fullerton Road, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, S60 1DL, England<P>
TiBAl grain refiners are known to be susceptible to fading and poisoning phenomena which can limit their effectiveness in some practical situations.The long-term fading behaviour of good and bad TiBAl grain refiners in 99.7% Al is presented as a function of temperature in the presence of Zr and other transition metals. It is shown that fade occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures and that the effects of Zr and other transition metals display a complex behaviour as a function of temperature. The observations are explained in terms of recent theories on the behaviour of TiBAl grain refiners which propose that potent TiB2 nuclei have TiAl3 layers present on certain facets. It is shown that the reported behaviour is consistent with interactions occurring between transition metals and the potent aluminide layer. Results are discussed in terms of key stages in the production of TiBAl grain refiners and lessons for the use of TiBAl in the aluminium industry are highlighted.

The commercial AlTiB master alloys for grain refinement of aluminium contain TiB2 particles, which can be coarse and have the tendency to agglomerate in the melt. As a result of this, quality problems in different products occur.In Zr and Cr containing alloys TiB2 interacts with these elements leading to inhomogenous grain structure. In order to avoid the above mentioned disadvantages of the grain refinement with TiB2, a co-operative research programme has been carried out, to develop an improved AlTiC grain refiner. The main objectives of the project were: Development of an efficient AlTiC master alloy. Fundamental research to understand the mechanism of an AlTiC grain refiner. Evaluation of test methods for determination of the grain refining efficiency and agglomeration behaviour of TiC as standard test methods. Production scale testing of the developed AlTiC master alloy. The paper presents the results with respect to the above mentioned objectives.

An Al-3% Ti-0.15% C master alloy has been developed and is now being used for ingot grain refinement in Alcoa. A description is given of the development of the high ratio Al-6% Ti-0.02% C master alloy and the progression from this alloy to the more acceptable lower ratio Al-3% Ti-0.15% C alloy. Acceptance for commercial use came only after extensive metallurgical characterization and evaluation of the grain refining performance, including the impact of alloy type and the presence of tramp elements. Details of the production, testing and characterization of this new grain refining master alloy are discussed.

Whereas small concentrations of Si have been shown to enhance the grain refinement of aluminium by addition of an Al-Ti-B master alloy grain refiner, increasing Si contents in excess of 2-3% result in a continuous increase in primary aluminium solid solution grain size. Two explanations of these observations have been proposed to date based on the influence of Si on either the nucleation or growth of the aluminium primary crystals. Neither of these explanations appears to fit all the available grain size data. In an attempt to further clarify the origin of the Si coarsening effect, grain size studies have been performed on Al-Si and Al-Zn alloys as a function of solute content. It appears that the coarsening is a result of the influence of the Si content on aluminium grain nucleation. A coarsening mechanism is suggested based on the coupled influence of Si level on melt undercooling and primary phase freezing range.

MODIFICATION OF SILICON IN EUTECTIC AND HYPER-EUTECTIC Al-Si ALLOYS: </B> <I>Ben Heshmatpour</I>, Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corporation, 12 West Boulevard, P.O. Box 768, Newfield, NJ 08344<P>
Refining of eutectic silicon in hyper-eutectic and eutectic Al-Si alloys is accomplished by using phosphorus-bearing additives. Commercially available copper-phosphorus (CuP) in a variety of forms and concentrations is widely used for this application. Large addition rates are needed for effective silicon modification via CuP. The recently developed ferro-phosphorus (FeP) based tableted product provides significant performance and cost advantages while requiring much smaller addition rates, lower alloy temperature, and short contact times. This paper compares the results for refinement of A390.1, B390.1, and 339.1 alloys using CuP and tableted FeP.

EFFECTS OF RESIDUAL TRANSITION METAL IMPURITIES ON ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND GRAIN REFINEMENT OF EC GRADE ALUMINIUM: </B> <I>R. Cook</I>, M.A. Kearns, P.S. Cooper, London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co. Ltd., Fullerton Road, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, S60 1DL, England<P>
Removal of transition metal impurities is a key step in production of high conductivity EC grade Aluminium. Titanium and Vanadium in particular are generally removed by adding an excess of Boron to precipitate stable borides before decanting the treated metal. It is nevertheless advantageous to add sufficient grain refiner to avoid hot cracking of the cast bar without jeopardising electrical conductivity. We report here a study of the effects of residual Vanadium on the efficiency of different grain refining additives and electrical conductivity of the product. It is shown that Vanadium must be below a threshold figure to give adequate grain refinement at levels which do not compromise conductivity. The effects of residual Fe and Si impurities on grain refinement and conductivity are also described and their role is discussed in terms of constitutional supercooling effects. The relevance of the results to the manufacture of EC grade wire is discussed.

EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES:</B> Rapha&euml;l Craen, <B> </B> <I>Nagy El-Kaddah</I>, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, P.O. Box 870202, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0202; Willem Lou&eacute;, P&eacute;chiney CRV, Parc Economique Centr'Alp-BP27, 38340 Voreppe, France<P>
The knowledge of the electrical conductivity of aluminum alloys is critical for the analysis and computer simulation of induction heating and melting operations as well as electromagnetic casters. While accurate conductivity data are available for pure aluminum, there is a paucity of data for aluminum alloys, particularly at elevated temperature. This paper describes an eddy current technique for measuring the electrical conductivity of metallic specimens at high temperatures. In this technique, which is based on measurement of the electric energy dissipation (Joule Heating), the electrical conductivity is determined from measurement of the heating rate of the specimen. The measurement is made by subjecting an insulated cylindrical specimen to a uniform axial alternating magnetic field, and measuring temperature of the specimen during heating. The method requires no contact with the specimen, and is capable of providing electrical conductivity data to the melting point of the specimen with an error of less than five percent. Upon validating the technique using pure aluminum, measurements have been conducted on Al-Mg (5182) and Al-Li (8090) wrought alloys, and on foundry and rheocast Al-Si (357) cast ingots. The results show that electrical conductivities of Si and Mg alloys are about one half of pure aluminum, and the microstructure of Al-Si 357 alloy has little effect on the electrical conductivity of the alloy. The Li containing alloy exhibited a much lower conductivity than Si and Mg alloys. Expressions are presented for the conductivities of these alloys up to 450&#176;C.

DETECTION OF SOLIDIFICATION REACTIONS USING HEAT PIPE TECHNOLOGY:</B> <I>M. Mahfoud</I>, F. Mucciardi, J.E .Gruzleski, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, McGill University, 3450 University Street, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2A7
<P>
Thermal analysis is the measurement of changes in the temperature of a material as it is cooled from an elevated temperature. Usually the temperature changes such as those which occur during solidification are recorded as a function of the cooling time to detect various phase transformations. Although the use of thermal analysis to study the solidification of aluminum dates back 30 to 40 years, the physical techniques for performing thermal analysis have hardly evolved. One aspect of research at McGill has focused on developing a novel device based on heat pipe technology for performing thermal analysis of aluminum alloys. The device operates in-situ on a semi-continuous basis. In addition, the new device allows predefined cooling rates to be set and/or changed during the solidification process. This paper describes the use of the device for: a) measuring grain refining of 356 alloy using Al-5% Ti master alloy, b) determination of eutectic modification of 356 and 413 alloys, and c) detection of reactions involving the formation of copper and iron intermetallics in Al-Si foundry alloys.

COMPUTER-AIDED COOLING CURVE ANALYSIS (CA-CCA), APPLIED TO AN Al-Si SYSTEM:</B> M.A. Ramirez A., J.C. Escobedo B., A.H. Castillejos E., A. Flores V., F.A. Acosta G., Centro de Investigaci&oacute;n y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Unidad Saltillo, P.O.Box 663, 25000 Saltillo, Coahuila, M&eacute;xico<P>
The computer-aided cooling curve analysis is a new method for thermal analysis that can be used in foundries of low budget and with small investment. This method tries to simulate the classic differential thermal analysis method (DTA) by using only an acquisition data system coupled to numerical methods in micro-computers. The kind of information provided by this technique includes thermodynamical and thermophysical data, heat transfer parameters, solidification kinetics, and microstructure features. All this information is more than that obtained with the classic DTA, and it is necessary in order to get a real comprehension of the solidification process. CA-CCA has been applied to the study of an Al-Si system to try to characterize it and to predict microstructure, because it is possible with this technique to obtain the evolution of solid during the solidification process and the segregation behaviour of this system.

ON THE EFFICIENCY OF IN-LINE DEVICES TO CLEAN THE MELT: </B><I>P. Pouly</I>, E. Wuilloud, Alusuisse Technology and Management Ltd., Technology Center Chippis, 3965 Chippis, Switzerland
<P>
Rotating impellers for injecting gas into aluminium melt are an often used in-line device to remove impurities. However, the treatment efficiency is seldom investigated, as the precise effect of flotation is not well understood. Moreover, the interpretation of the results obtained by measuring the inclusion content is not always obvious. For these reasons, it is sometimes observed that rotors work in an erroneous way. This paper illustrates how the variation of some parameters can affect, either in a good or a bad way, the efficiency of rotating impellers. The problematic of measurement techniques with some of their limitations will also be exposed. A special emphasis will be laid on inclusion removal.

<P>
The flowfield in the HI10 HYCAST reactor is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The paper demonstrates how fluid flow calculations can be used to interpolate between experimental velocities. The experiments are performed by a two component Laser Doppler-technique in a reactor which has one single baffle. In the 3-dimensional computation a rotating grid for the rotor is imposed on the stationary grid for the reactor body. The flow effects caused by the baffle are discussed in relation to metallurgical performance. The turbulent dissipation rate is translated into bubble sizes and the result is compared to experimental bubble sizes. The paper discusses the reasons for deviations between predicted and experimental velocities.

IN-LINE FLUXING WITH HIGH SPEED MULTIPLE DISPERSER ROTORS: </B><I>D.C. Chesonis</I>, H. Yu, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, 100 Technical Drive, Alcoa Center, PA 15069; M. Scherbak, Aluminum Company of America, Ingot Technology Group, 900 South Gay Street, Knoxville, TN 37902
<P>
The impurity removal efficiency of in-line fluxing equipment depends strongly on the interfacial area between the gas bubbles and the molten metal. High interfacial areas can be generated by direct shearing of the gas bubbles using rotating dispersers. Placing multiple dispersers on a single rotor shaft and injecting gas into the metal at each disperser increases this direct shearing, improving the efficiency of the in-line fluxing unit. Small dispersers can operate at high gas loading and high speed without vortexing. Small dispersers also allow smaller metal treatment units, reducing floor space requirements and metal holdup. This paper will summarize the theory behind the direct shearing approach and will present data illustrating the difference in trace element removal for single, double, and triple disperser rotors. Comparisons with other in-line fluxing equipment will also be presented.

EVOLUTION OF THE ALPUR&#174; ROTOR TOWARDS IMPROVED PERFORMANCE: </B><I>Isabelle Ventre</I>, Jean-Marie Chateau, Pechiney Aluminium Engineering, Centr'Alp-725 rue Aristide Berg&egrave;s, F-38340 Voreppe, France
<P>
The ability of a rotary injector to efficiently reduce dissolved hydrogen and impurities in an in-line treatment box is directly related to its ability to create an intimate dispersion of tiny bubbles of treatment gases within the aluminum melt. This is achieved through a combination of shearing effect of the injected gas flow and strong pumping of the metal contained in the box. The pumping action of the rotary injector can however create some metal recirculation loops within the box and cause undesirable turbulences at the surface of the metal inside the box. To address this issue the design of the Alpur&#174; rotor was improved and optimized which resulted in drastic improvement of the surface conditions without affecting the intrinsic performance of this injector. We review in this paper the basic criteria for this optimum rotor design and assess through water modelling and testing in aluminum the overall benefits for the operation.

The effects of fluxing grain refined molten aluminium with Ar/Cl2 gas mixtures have been studied both in the laboratory and during experimental casthouse trials. Samples taken during gas fluxing were subjected to chemical analysis and examined in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Detailed chemical analysis of agglomerates was undertaken in the SEM using energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the elements Na, K and F were found to be associated with TiB2 clusters. Results will be presented in detail and discussed in the context of previously published work on grain refiner characterization and wettability of TiB2 in liquid Al/salt mixtures.

COALESCENCE BEHAVIOUR OF ALUMINUM DROPLETS UNDER A MOLTEN SALT FLUX COVER: </B><I>K.J.

<P>
The formation of a suspension of aluminum droplets in salt fluxes used during the refining and recycling of aluminum, leads to decreased aluminum recovery. To enhance the coalescence and recovery, it is required to remove the oxide layer formed on the surface of these small aluminum drops. Coalescence behaviour of aluminum droplets under a molten salt flux cover was investigated using a hot stage microscope at a temperature of 740&#176;C. Two salt systems were studied: i) an equal weight mixture of NaCl-KCl with chloride and fluoride additives and ii) the MgCl2-KCl system with fluoride additives. Chloride salts did nothing to enhance coalescence but fluoride additions to both salt systems removed the oxide film from the metal. NaF, KF and Na3AlF6 additives were the most effective salts at stripping away the oxide layer and promoting coalescence. As the concentration of MgCl2 increased, the ability of the droplets to coalesce decreased significantly.

KINETICS OF MAGNESIUM REMOVAL FROM ALUMINUM ALLOYS BY CHLORINE FLUXING:</B> Qian Fu, <I>J.W .Evans</I>, Dept. of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley CA 94720
<P>
Chlorine fluxing (sparging chlorine-argon mixtures into the melt) is a standard procedure for eliminating magnesium from Al-Mg alloys. The kinetics of the reactions/mass transport involved have not been extensively studied in the past. The paper describes an ongoing investigation of those kinetics. Much of the work to date has been using laboratory-scale melts with magnesium removal measured by analysis of samples. Techniques have been developed to measure both bubble frequency and bubble residence time in the melt, enabling estimation of the total interfacial area and, consequently, the intrinsic kinetics of the phenomena involved. It is observed that, above the melting point of MgCl2, there exists a &quot;critical Mg concentration&quot;. Above this critical concentration the reactions are sufficiently fast that all entering chlorine is converted to MgCl2 and there are negligible chlorine emissions. Below this concentration, Mg mass transport in the alloy appears to be rate-controlling. The results are interpreted in terms of a mathematical model for fluxing. The paper also describes the preliminary results of experiments on a larger scale (few tens kg alloy) in which bubble probes are used to detect the dispersion of gas injected into the melt and measure the interfacial area.

INTERFACIAL TENSION BETWEEN ALUMINUM AND CHLORIDE-FLUORIDE MELTS: </B><I>A. Silny</I>, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, SK-84236 Bratislava, Slovakia; T.A. Utigard, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Toronto, M5S 3E4 Toronto, Canada
<P>
A technique was developed for the measurement of the interfacial tension between liquid metals and molten salts at elevated temperatures. The technique is based on the measurement of the capillary depression ocurring when a capillary, which is moved vertically down through the molten salt layer, passes through the salt/metal interface. The depression is measured by simultaneous video recording of the immersion height of the alumina capillary and the position of a liquid meniscus in a horizontal tube connected to the alumina capillary. The interfacial tension was measured in the following systems: aluminium and an equimolar melt of NaCl and KCl with several salt additions at 1000 K, aluminium and NaCl-NaF at 1123 K, and aluminium and NaCl-KF at 1123 K and aluminium and equimolar melt of NaCl-KCl with additions of NaF, KF, LiF, BaF2, SrF2, CaF2, Na3AlF6, MgF2 and AlF3. It was found that the interfacial tension decreases with increasing NaF, KF, LiF, CaF2, BaF2 and SrF2 additions, remains unchanged with AlF3 additions and slightly decreases with MgF2 and Na3AlF6 additions. Aluminium and equimolar melt of NaCl-KCl with additions of LiCl, AlCl3, BaCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2. All above chlorides slightly increase the interfacial tension in the system. Obtained data are compared with the ones found in literature and some conclusions for the aluminium refining and recycling were derived.

<P>
A comparative study on the efficiencies of Na2SiF6 and AlF3 for demagging molten aluminum by submerged powder injection is reported. Experimental trials carried out at a scale of 250 Kg molten metal furnace capacity showed that the higher efficiencies, ~ 70%, were attained by the use of the Na2SiF6 powder. The basic parameter to establish the comparison between the two demagging agents was the powder size, maintaining constant the other important parameters, e.g., initial magnesium content, carrier gas flow-to-powder flow ratio, pressure of the carrier gas, temperature of the bath, the dimensions of the reactor and the shape and dimensions of the injection lance. The removal efficiency was monitored analyzing the magnesium content in both the metal and the slag. The fumes produced were also analyzed, having found that the Na2SiF6 powders have the inconvenience of giving place to the generation of highly toxic SiF4 fumes.

UPDATE ON MOLTEN METAL INCIDENT REPORTING:</B> S.G. Epstein, The Aluminum Association Inc., 900 19th St., N.W., Washington, DC 20006
<P>
Millions of pounds of molten aluminum are handled every day, safely and without incident, in nearly every segment of the aluminum industry. However, there are inherent hazards in handling any molten material and explosions involving molten aluminum and water or other oxidizing contaminants continue to occur in plants throughout the world. While these are infrequent events that often result in little or no damage to equipment or injury to personnel, an awareness of the possible consequences of an explosion is critical to maintaining a safe casthouse. The aluminum industry has made an extensive effort to gain an understanding of molten metal explosions, the factors that promote them, and how they might be prevented. The effort has included laboratory studies, conducted over the past 45 years, and thorough investigations of plant incidents. As part of this effort, the Aluminum Association established in 1985 a world-wide molten metal incident reporting program to obtain and share information on plant incidents. Presently, there are more than 230 participants in the program representing about 300 plants located in about 20 countries. Findings from the nearly 1200 reports submitted to date are reviewed in this paper.

INVESTIGATION OF COATINGS WHICH PREVENT MOLTEN ALUMINUM/WATER EXPLOSIONS - PROGRESS REPORT: </B><I>R.T. Richter</I>, D.D. Le&oacute;n, T.L. Levendusky, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, Alcoa Center, PA 15069
<P>
The aluminum industry has used Porter International 7001 (Tarset Std.) successfully as a protective coating in casting pits for over 20 years to prevent molten aluminum and water explosions until it was withdrawn from the market in 1994. The Aluminum Association contracted with Alcoa in 1995 to identify and test alternate coating materials which would be an acceptable replacement for Tarset Std. This paper will report the status of the program which was initiated in September 1995 and will be concluding in late 1996. Included in this paper are the screening and selection processes of the candidate coatings, results of initial molten aluminum/water explosion tests and the selection of the best performers for final explosion tests.

PROMOTING AWARENESS OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS IN ALUMINUM SCRAP: </B><I>D.C. Pierce</I>, C.H. Kenney, Reynolds Metals Company, 6601 West Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23261
<P>
There are a variety of potential safety hazards in any industrial activity and this includes the melting of aluminum scrap. The source of most hazards in scrap aluminum is the moisture or contamination that the scrap contains. Melting internal or purchased scrap remains the prevailing cause of molten metal incidents today. Everyone who handles scrap aluminum, from the first collection through to the melting, needs to be aware of the potential hazards. Facilities need to use a variety of approaches to increase safety awareness in all the operations. Scrap collectors, suppliers and brokers must be mindful of what the scrap hazards are, and the receiving plants must take steps to keep the hazards out of their casthouses. One of the new tools that plants have available is a fax-notification system operated by the Aluminum Association for information on scrap that has been rejected by another facility for safety or health reasons. This system is felt to offer an important safety enhancement, because scrap dealers have been known to resell unsafe scrap after it has been rejected. Although the Scrap Rejection Notification System is currently operational, its success will be measured by how infrequently it is needed.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR SOW CASTING AND MELTING:</B> G.N. Chaffin, Quality Challenges, Midlothian, VA 23112; J.E. Jacoby, Consultant, 3398 North Hills Road, Murrysville, PA 15668
<P>
The aluminum industry has experienced many incidents of explosions as a result of wet or contaminated sows being charged into molten metal. The presence of moisture in the cavity of a sow is often impossible to detect and therefore the sow is assumed to be safe. However, this undetected moisture can cause a serious explosion if it is submerged into molten aluminum. The Aluminum Association has prepared guidelines for sow casting, inspection and melting to help facilities protect themselves from the potential hazards associated with melting sows. The guidelines and this paper consider mold designs, casting, transportation &amp; storage, inspection and melting operations. Recommendations are offered which can be used in conjunction with each plant&#180s practices. The recommendations can help both the casting facility and the melting plant work toward a decrease in the possibility of an incident involving the melting of sows.

THE SEARCH FOR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING FOR WORKERS EXPOSED TO THE HAZARDS OF MOLTEN ALUMINUM AND MOLTEN BATH: </B><I>Ronald R. McHaney</I>, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation
<P>
Burns are one of the leading causes of work injuries within the aluminum industry. Some physical and chemical properties of molten aluminum - low emissivity and viscosity - contribute to the potential for injury-producing incidents. Other properties, including high heat of fusion and shrinkage characteristics during cooling, add complexity to the task of identifying suitable protective clothing for workers exposed to the hazards of molten aluminum and bath. This presentation will address the initiative to identify protective clothing for workers exposed to those hazards and the progress that has been made including the development and application of the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) designation: F955, &quot;Standard Test Method for Evaluating Heat Transfer Through Materials for Protective Clothing Upon Contact with Molten Substances&quot;. In addition, I will discuss the need to consider worker comfort and the potential for heat stress in the selection process.

MODELLING OF SOLIDIFICATION IN Al-ALLOYS:</B> <I>Nigel Saunders,</I> Thermotech Ltd., The Surrey Research Park, Guildford GU2 5YG, and IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom
<P>
Solidification in Al-alloys is a complex process usually occuring under non-equilibrium conditions with the possible formation of metastable low melting point eutectics and non-equilibrium phases. However, it has recently been shown that it is possible to use thermodynamic phase diagram calculations to simulate the non-equilibrium solidification of complex Al-alloys under so-called 'Scheil' conditions. Excellent results can be obtained for features such as fraction solid transformed as a function of temperature, phase formation, latent enthalpy and Cp of solidification etc. All of these features are important input into modelling of solidification processing particularly for software packages which simulate heat flow during casting. The paper will present the results of 'Scheil' simulations for a wide range of commercial Al-alloys showing comparison with experimental results for fraction solid transformed and phase formation. The use of subsequently derived Cp and heat evolution parameters in casting simulation packages will be discussed and examples of its application shown.

THE APPLICATION OF EFFICIENT PARALLEL PROCESSING TO FINITE ELEMENT MODELING OF FILLING, SOLIDIFICATION, AND DEFECT PREDICTION FOR ULTRA-LARGE SHAPE CASTINGS: </B><I>David Snyder</I>, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, 100 Technical Drive, Alcoa Center, PA 15069; David Waite, Consultant, Coralville, IA; Alpesh Amin, HP/Convex Corporation, Atlanta, GA
<P>
Finite element modeling has become widely to used simulate the filling, solidification, and defect formation in casting processes. For extremely large, complex parts, typical of automotive structural applications, the high cost of tooling makes process modeling an extremely useful tool. However, as the size and complexity of casting part geometry increase, the computational requirements for modeling become formidable. To address the challenge for modeling ultra-large shape castings, a finite element code was developed to efficiently take advantage of shared-memory parallel computing systems. This paper gives a brief description of the mathematical models which describe the casting processes. The implementation of the models and the numerical issues regarding memory architecture, parsing of computations, cpu synchronization, and overhead minimization for parallel processing are discussed. Examples are presented for filling and solidification analyses of permanent mold, tilt-pour, and die casting models run on an 8-CPU HP/Convex SPP-1000 computer.

IN-SITU TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN LOW PRESSURE PERMANENT MOLD CASTING:</B> <I>Florence Paray</I>, Joe Gruzleski, Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, McGill University, 3450 University Street, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2A7; Joe Clements, Grenville Castings Ltd., Merrickville, ONT, Canada K0G 1N0; Bahadir Kulunk, Timminco Metals, Research and Development Center, Haley, ONT, Canada K0J 1Y0
<P>
The low pressure casting process has an increasing popularity as it allows a rapid production of components close to the final &quot;near net shape&quot; with a very good casting yield. Depending on the property requirements of the final product, it is often necessary to control casting soundness. Internal porosity can cause a loss of pressure tightness, a critical factor in parts such as engine blocks and manifolds which are required to keep various gases and fluids. The development of criteria functions should allow the prediction of the thermal conditions required to maintain porosity below some critical predetermined level. In order to determine criteria functions, it is necessary to acquire thermal data during casting solidification. A low pressure casting machine and die were instrumented to obtain &quot;in situ&quot; thermal analysis curves during the solidification of flat plates of thickness varying from 1/8&quot; to 3/4&quot; in Sr modified and unmodified 6290, 356 and 319 alloys. The paper describes that effort and some of the results obtained.

A TECHNIQUE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF INSTANTANEOUS HEAT TRANSFER AT THE MOLD/METAL INTERFACE DURING CASTING:</B> Michael Trovant, <I>Stavros Argyropoulos</I>, Department of Metallurgy &amp; Materials Science, University of Toronto, 184 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3E4
<P>
Many current advancements responsible for improving the accuracy of solidification algorithms have resulted from the incorporation of additional complex casting related phenomena into the numerical calculation scheme. More recently, however, the proper specification of boundary conditions has been found to play a critical role in limiting model inaccuracy. Of particular interest to casting are the temperature boundary conditions, which when adopted by many models appear to be the most troublesome. Temperature boundary conditions can vary significantly with time and position along the face of the casting and accurate heat transfer coefficients are notoriously difficult to obtain experimentally for all points on the mold/metal interface, especially when the influence of thermal contraction is acknowledged. A novel technique which minimizes the error associated with selecting boundary conditions without experimentation is proposed. Advanced knowledge of the air gap formation and its correlation to the heat transfer coefficient at the mold/metal interface is used to formulate a coupled mathematical model which determines the increase of the air gap and predicts the instantaneous cooling conditions at a given mold wall. The objective is to allow the modeler to estimate effect of thermal contraction on the heat loss at mold/metal interfaces without resorting to experimentation.

MECHANISM OF DENDRITE FRAGMENTATION IN CASTINGS: </B><I>Shan Liu</I>, Shu-Zu Lu, A .Hellawell, Michigan Technological University, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
A temperature gradient stage was designed with a controlled deceleration mechanism to simulate the columnar growth in castings/ingots where the growth velocities and temperature gradients at a dendritic front undergo a continuous decrease during solidification. Transparent materials of SCN-H2O and NH4Cl-H2O systems were used so that the solidification process with various decelerations could be directly observed and video recorded. It is observed that fragmentation of secondary arms is directly related to the deceleration and this provides an intrinsic resource for the formation of equiaxed grains in castings where convection may be available for transportation of the fragments to the open liquid. The responses of a dendritic array to the deceleration, including primary spacing adjustment and tip radius adjustment etc., are also observed and discussed.

THE VISUALIZATION OF THE PARTICLE CONTENT OF LIQUID ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>N.D.G. Mountford</I>, A. Simionescu, I.D. Sommerville, Department of Metallurgy &amp; Materials Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3E4
<P>
Aluminum alloys can contain heterogenous impurities which will affect the strength of the final product and result in either failure during manufacture or in service. Pulsed ultrasound, conveyed down metal guide-rods from energized piezo-electric crystals, is passed into the liquid metal and reflections from any impurities can be recorded by special counting devices. Small particles of the order of 10 to 15 &#181;m can be resolved and their behaviour such as in settling recorded. Sequential tests using particles of identified size and distribution such as SiC and TiAl3 demonstrated the systems reproducibility. Such changes in composition resulting from imposed turbulent transfer with the associated pick up of very small oxide particles could also be shown. The effect of &quot;sludge&quot; formation such as that found in die-casting applications due to intermetallic phase precipitation could also be measured. This could be of value in process control of die casting systems. The developed system is adaptable to on line quality measurement and the recording of molten aluminum cleanliness in crucibles, ladles, furnace wells, launders and other transfer systems.

FRACTAL ANALYSIS: POROSITY IN ALUMINUM CAST ALLOY:</B> Bo-Tao Lee, <I>Shu-Zu Lu</I>, A. Hellawell, Michigan Technological University, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
Porosity is a very common defect in Al-Si cast alloy. To examine the porosity, a fractal analysis was conducted to characterize the pores using two numbers, Fractal Dimension, D, and Shape Factor, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">. This analysis was based on the measurement of perimeters/areas of all individual pores using an image analyzer with changing magnifications. The result indicates that two types of pores, i.e., rough/shrinkage pores and smooth/hydrogen pores, can be distinguished by these fractal numbers. The shrinkage pores show a larger value of fractal dimensions whereas the hydrogen pores have a fractal dimension close to one. Combined with analysis for silicon particles, it is suggested numerically that shrinkage pores are more likely associated with the silicon phase that is not well modified, showing a rather coarse flake structure, and the hydrogen pores are in the regions where modification was well done with fine silicon particles.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF DIE FILLING IN SEMISOLID METAL PROCESSING:</B> Andreas N.

<P>
Semisolid Metal Processing is gaining interest very rapidly. This manufacturing approach offers distinct advantages over other near-net-shape technologies, like a more homogenous microstructure and less porosity and thus excellent mechanical properties. A perfect control of the die filling during processing is however necessary, especially in the case of semisolid forming of aluminum, where a non-controlled die filling can lead to oxide inclusions. Numerical simulation would be a powerful tool, as it would allow to predict die filling and the optimization of die design. However, the constitutive behaviour of such semisolid metals is rather complex. Their non-Newtonian behaviour does not depend only on the volume fraction of liquid, but also on the metal&#180s history prior to processing and the processing conditions. In this paper, a Bingham power-law relation is presented, capable of describing correctly the rheological behaviour of the semisolid metal. This constitutive equation is then introduced in a modified version of the casting simulation package SIMULOR. Simulation results on the filling of a 2-D cavity under various conditions are shown. Issues related to die design of dies, using numerical simulation will also be addressed.

SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSING OF ALUMINUM CASTING ALLOY REINFORCED WITH CERAMIC MICROSPHERES FOR THIXOFORMING:</B> P.D.D. Rodrigo, <I>K. Xia</I>, N. Setargew, Materials Group, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia 3052; P. Fitzgerald, G. Withers, Cyco International, 1297 Nepean Highway, Cheltenham, Victoria, Australia 3192
<P>
A cast aluminum matrix composite based on an Al-Si-Mg alloy has been developed. The reinforcement was in the form of hollow microspheres, a ceramic by-product from coal power stations. The particles were incorporated into the aluminum alloy melt by mechanical stirring either in the semisolid state or full liquid state. The composite melt was cast from full liquid temperature to produce slugs for thixoforming. A variety of compositions, reinforcement volume fractions and processing parameters were used. The as-cast microstructure consisted of fine, equiaxed dendritic primary grains in a matrix of secondary grains and eutectic phases. The primary dendritic grains evolved to become non-dendritic after reheating the slugs to semisolid temperature. The slugs were subsequently thixoformed at a temperature corresponding to a primary solid fraction of about 50% into thin plates and alternator pulleys. Special wear tests on the pulleys showed that they were comparable to steel pulleys. The material is potentially suitable for those applications demanding good wear resistance, light weight and low cost.

MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF INCLUSIONS IN AA3104 D&amp;I CAN STOCK ALLOY:</B> <I>Xiangwen Wang</I>, Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research &amp; Development, Reynolds Metals Company, 3326 E. 2nd St., Muscle Shoals, AL 335661<P>
Metallic and non-metallic inclusions have long been recognized as one of the most important quality issues for aluminum can body alloys. Existence of the inclusions is often the cause of pinholes and high tear-off rate in the canmaking process. They also impose severe complications for alloy down-gauging. This paper presents the morphological aspects of the major inclusions commonly seen in AA3104 can stock alloy. The potential sources which may introduce inclusions in the alloy are also described. Some case studies are conducted to isolate the inclusions for characterization. The results can be utilized for understanding the mechanism of the inclusion formation and selection of proper materials in dealing with the molten alloy prior to ingot casting in order to minimize or eliminate the potential inclusion sources.

A joint programme was set up between Foseco and VAW aluminium AG in order to establish data on the relevant positions of fine foam ceramic filters and more specifically, to investigate the performance characteristics of bonded particle tube cartridge filter systems. The object of this work was to generate fundamental data on the filtration efficiency of a number of in-line treatment units used singly and in combination. The impact of these treatments on metal quality was determined by LiMCA, PoDFA and LAIS for carefully controlled plant conditions. This paper expands on the result of the first phase of the programme which was presented to TMS in 1996. It goes on to present results of inclusion size distribution removal data for medium and fine pore CFF&#180s and for the cartridge tube filter. Results of metallographic examination of spent tubes and ceramic foam reported along with PoDFA data of typical metal. After summarizing the relative efficiencies of each of these systems it also includes results of the impact of a degassing unit run alone and in combination with a ceramic foam filter.

Spent rigid tube filter sections were examined following a number of alloy 3004 casts. Examination revealed the presence of the phases normally found in 3004 which formed during solidification, as well as the capture of salt, oxide and grain refiner particulate. Chemical and SEM analysis revealed that, for the most part, two mechanisms of filter blockage appear to be operative. In addition to filter cake buildup, on a portion of the tube, some of the 1-2 micron grain refiner particulate have reacted within the filter body forming coarser complexes. The blockage mechanisms and their impact on filter life and filter design and usage are discussed.

It has been known that grain refiner such as Al-Ti and Al-Ti-B would influence on the filter life in molten aluminum filtration. A new experimental technique was conducted to make clear the influence of Al-Ti master alloy on a filter life of Rigid Media Filter (RMF). It is shown that the concentration of titanium in the grain refiner and holding time after adding the grain refiner affect the filter life.

DEPOSITION OF PARTICLES TO A BUBBLE:</B> Elin Haugland, Thorvald A. Engh, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Metallurgy, Alfred Getz Vei 2b, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway<P>
Experiments have been performed to study turbulent deposition of particles to a bubble. Water, containing particles, flowed down through a column. Bubbles were let into the column through a glass capillary tube in the lower part of the column, and then held at the capillary tube. The experiments were carried out with quartz particles in both clean distilled water and in water which amine was added. The bubble was allowed to rise into a collector tube. To determine the amount of particles collected by the bubble, the water/particle dispersion was filtered and the remaining mass was weighted. Velocities and turbulence were measured by laser doppler velocimetry. Particle-bubble collisions were studied with a high-speed videocamera. The results indicate that particle collection on the bubbles reaches saturation. The particles seem to have a certain residence time at the bubble surface, before they leave the bubble.

ENHANCED FLOTATION OF INCLUSIONS TO BUBBLES DUE TO TURBULENCE:</B> <I>Rune Gammels&aelig;ter</I>, Stein Tore Johansen, SINTEF Materials Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; Knut Bech, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway<P>
Experimental results indicate that turbulence may enhance the flotation rate of non-metallic inclusions to bubbles significantly. In this paper possible flow phenomena responsible for such effects are investigated. We recognize that the turbulent flow consists of a spectrum of eddy sizes. The eddies larger than the bubble diameter can only displace the bubble. Only the smaller eddies contribute to an enhanced turbulent deposition of inclusions. The turbulent flow over single bubbles are computed and the turbulent trajectories of inclusions approaching the bubbles are calculated. The resulting collection efficiencies are discussed and compared to available experimental results.

KINETICS OF INCLUSION REMOVAL FROM MOLTEN ALUMINUM UNDER AN APPLIED ALTERNATING MAGNETIC FIELD:</B> <I>Ashish D.Patel</I>, Nagy El-Kaddah, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, P.O. Box 870202, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0202<P>
Electromagnetic filtration is an emerging technology for purification of molten metals. This particle separation method relies on the huge difference in the electrical conductivity of the metal and non-metallic inclusions to drive the motion of the under an applied force field. The principle of electromagnetic separation will be briefly reviewed together with methods of generating a force field in molten metals. Also described is an induced current separator for the removal of non-metallic inclusions from molten aluminum. The key feature of this system is that the force field has no stirring component, which is necessary to prevent particle entrapment within flow eddies. The system was used to investigate the kinetics of inclusion removal from molten aluminum using 100 and 200&#181; size particles at low applied magnetic field of 0.015 T. The results show complete removal of these inclusion particles under these conditions and particle migration in the melt occurs in a direction opposite to the force field, as predicted by the theory. Analytical expression was developed to predict the rate of inclusion removal in induced current systems. The experimentally determined rate was found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The scale-up of the system for industrial applications will be discussed.

CONSISTENCY OF INCLUSIONS IN PURE MAGNESIUM:</B> <I>Per Bakke</I>, Dag Ove Karlsen, Norsk Hydro a.s., P.O. Box 2560, N-3901 Porsgrunn, Norway; Jean-Alain Laurin, Andr&eacute; Provost, Norsk Hydro Canada Inc., 7000 boul. Raoul-Duchesne, B&eacute;cancour, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada G0X 1B0<P>
In order to examine the consistency of metal quality with respect to oxide inclusions, salts and intermetallic particles, filter samples were taken randomly from the casting chamber during normal production of pure magnesium at Norsk Hydro Canada in 1995. The contents of oxide particles, oxide films, salts and intermetallic particles were measured by optical microscopy and image analysis of the sliced and polished filter samples. The results indicate that the contents of oxide particles, oxide films, salts and intermetallic particles are low and consistent; normally well below 1 mm3/kg for all types of inclusions. Oxide inclusions and intermetallic particles are usually smaller than 50 &#181;m and 20 &#181;m, respectively. The filter sampling method and analysis technique used in the quantitative microscopy are discussed in some detail, emphasising advantages and drawbacks. The impact of the most common inclusions in pure magnesium on aluminium alloy quality is discussed from a thermodynamic point of view.

THE EFFECTS OF MAGNESIUM, ATMOSPHERE COMPOSITION, AGITATION AND TEMPERATURE ON THE SURFACE OXIDE FILM FORMATION AND MELT INCLUSION CONTENT IN Al-Mg ALLOYS:</B> <I>Daryoush Emadi</I>, Mihriban Pekguleryuz, Alcan-UQAC Chair in Solidification and Metallurgy of Aluminum, University of Quebec at Chicoutimi, Local 4-333 Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada G7H 2B1<P>
To obtain high quality ingots, the generation of inclusions must be prevented during the various stages of liquid metal manipulation. In an attempt to understand the nature of oxide film generation, the oxidation behaviour of Al-Mg melts with different Mg contents of 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% were studied in air, argon and carbon dioxide. Moreover, the effects of agitation and temperature on the nature of melt surface oxide films were investigated. For each condition, the growth process and the morphology of the surface oxide films behaved differently. In addition, this study used the Liquid Metal Cleanliness Analyzer (LiMCA) and Porous Disk Filtration Apparatus (PoDFA) to investigate the effect of melt agitation and Mg content on the melt inclusion content. The results indicate that agitation and magnesium increase both the melt inclusion content and the average inclusion size. In addition, the oxide film removal from the surface of the melt affects the melt oxidation behaviour significantly.

COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THREE REFRACTORY MATERIALS FOR HOT-TOP BILLET CASTING SYSTEMS AT GOLDENDALE ALUMINUM COMPANY: </B>J. Martin Ekenes, Consultant, N.3418 Arden Road, Otis Orchards, WA 99027; Larry Bennett, Goldendale Aluminum Company, Craig Johnson, Permatech Inc.
<P>
The life of refractory components in billet hot-top casting systems is often the factor limiting mold package life. Evaluation of new materials in commercial casting operations requires careful planning in order to assure integrity in data collection. A full scale test spanning a five month period was conducted at Goldendale Aluminum Company comparing two silica based precision castable refractories and a graphite reinforced calcium-silica board. Comprehensive records facilitated testing a variety of hypotheses. This paper describes plan development, implementation, data collection, analysis, and the conclusion drawn.

CALCIUM CONTAMINATION OF MOLTEN Al-Mg ALLOYS BY CALCIUM CARBONATE POWDER: </B><I>Dennis D. Yancey</I>, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; David H. DeYoung, Aluminum Company of America, Molten Metal Processing Center, Alcoa Technical Center, Alcoa Center, PA 15069
<P>
A bench-scale study has been conducted to determine the effects of melt temperature, alloy composition, and powdered calcium carbonate quantity on Ca contamination of molten Al-Mg alloys. Calcium carbonate powder is often used in ingot plants as a &quot;caulking&quot; material in troughs, joints, etc. to prevent molten metal leaks. Results of the study show that: (i) at melt temperatures above 1425&#176;F, calcium carbonate markedly increases the concentration of Ca in molten Al-4.5 wt% Mg alloy; (ii) Mg is required for the reaction of CaCO3 with the aluminum melt to occur; (iii) for a given quantity of calcium carbonate, within the temperature range of 1400-1550&#176;F, increase in melt temperature increases Ca contamination; (iv) for a given temperature of 1450&#176;F or 1550&#176;F and within 0.008-0.36 wt% CaCO3, increase in the quantity of calcium carbonate markedly increases both the rate of Ca contamination and the maximum concentration of Ca obtained in the melt for a 5 hour interaction period. The decomposition of calcium carbonate and the associated Ca contamination of molten Al-Mg alloy appears to be a kinetically-driven phenomenon.

INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT METAL FEEDING SYSTEMS ON CAST STRUCTURES USING A WATER MODEL: </B><I>A. Buchholz</I>, S. Engler, M.-S. Ji, W. Schmitz, Foundry Institute, RWTH Aachen, Intzestr.5, D-52056 Aachen, Germany
<P>
Forced convection imposed by the feeding system plays an important role in the solidification of continuous casting processes. Convection modifies heat and mass transport and thus has a significant impact on the cast structure. A better understanding of the fluid dynamics promises an improvement of continuous casting processes. To investigate flow patterns and the influence of different inlet systems on cast structures a water model was designed maintaining dynamic similarity between model and real casting equipment. Sump profiles were derived from etch lines achieved from real castings. The flow patterns were studied for different metal distributors comprising horizontal, vertical, inclined spouts and diffusor bag. The effect of the different flow patterns is correlated with results of metallographic analysis. The experiments are reviewed by some aspects of numerical simulation. The results show that physical modelling remains an instructive tool to study the dynamic behaviour of transient flow phenomena.

PHYSICAL (BY PARTICLE IMAGE CELOCIMETRY) AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF METAL DELIVERY DEVICES FOR EM AND DC CASTING OF ALUMINUM:</B> Dong Xu, <I>J.W.

<P>
A half-section water model of a pilot scale caster (at RMC, Richmond, Virginia) has been constructed at UC Berkeley. A particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) system has been assembled to measure velocities in the model for various simulated nozzle and bag geometries. The PIV system is a relatively inexpensive system using an incandescent light source, rather than the usual high-power laser. A digital camera, microcomputer and software (Optical Flow Systems) track the frame-to-frame movement of neutral-density particles in the water and provide vector maps of the velocity. Measured velocities have been compared to velocities computed using the finite element package FIDAP and show good agreement.

INFLUENCE OF FLUID FLOW FIELD AND POURING TEMPERATURE ON THERMAL GRADIENTS IN THE MUSHY ZONE DURING LEVEL POUR CASTING OF BILLETS: </B><I>G.-U. Gr&uuml;n</I>, W. Schneider, VAW aluminium AG, Research and Development, Georg-von-Boeselager-Str.25, D-53117 Bonn, Germany
<P>
The occurrence of feathery crystals during experimental casting trials on a level pour casting unit yields a strong relationship as well to the pouring temperature as to the governing fluid flow pattern within the liquid melt pool of the billet. Three-dimensional simulations of the coupled fluid flow and heat transfer problem during the stationary phase of the level pour casting process are used to investigate the variations of the thermal field in the liquid part of the solidifying billet. The calculated flow field patterns and temperatures are discussed in dependency of casting velocity, pouring temperature and size of pouring gate. The resulting thermal gradients in the mushy zone over the circumference of the billet are correlated to microstructure analysis of the corresponding casting trials.

OPEN MOLD WITHOUT DISTORSION FOR ALUMINUM DC CASTING: MODELING AND TESTING THE OPTIMUM SHAPE AND MATERIAL: </B><I>B. Hannart</I>, Pechiney Rhenalu, Centr'Alp-BP24, F-38340 Voreppe, France; O. Bonnet, Pechiney CRV, Centr'Alp-BP27, F-38340 Voreppe, France; A. Noraz, Aluminium Pechiney, Centr'Alp-BP27, F-38340 Voreppe, France
<P>
The thermomechanical behaviour of open molds used for DC casting of aluminum slabs was analysed, and their design was optimized, in order to avoid thermal distorsion. The analysis used a thermomechanical finite element model, describing the mold geometry, the material properties, and the heat transfer between mold, molten metal and cooling water. The deformations observed during and after the casting were realistically reproduced, both in 3D and in 2D. The 2D model, allowing to test new designs in less than 10 minutes, was used to propose several solutions for reducing the residual distorsion of the mold. The different solutions were tested in industrial conditions at Aluminium Dunkerque, and mold distorsions were systematically measured. With the optimum choice of mold geometry and alloy, the residual distorsion was completely eliminated.

DIRECT CHILL CASTING OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS: INGOT DISTORSIONS AND MOLD DESIGN OPTIMIZATION: </B><I>J.-M. Drezet</I>, M. Rappaz, Laboratoire de M&eacute;tallurgie Physique, Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, MX-G, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland
<P>
During the direct chill (DC) semi-continuous casting of aluminum alloys, the metal experiences high thermal stresses which are partially relaxed by deformation. This deformation is responsible for three main ingot distorsions: butt curl, butt swell and non-uniform rolling faces pull-in. These distortions are detrimental to the productivity of the process because they require butt sawing and more ingot scalping before rolling. On the other hand, residual stresses may induce longitudinal cracking of the cold ingots. Under pseudo steady-state conditions, i.e. after nearly one meter of casting, the solidified shell contracts towards the liquid pool (Pull-in). This contraction which amounts to about 9% at the lateral faces center is only 2% at the ingot corner. If a rectangular mold is employed, the resulting ingot is therefore concave (&quot;bone shape&quot;). To compensate for this non-uniform contraction of the ingot, the sides of the mold are designed with a convex shape, usually with three linear segments. Nevertheless, instead of producing flat rolling sheet ingots, such molds produce W-type ingot cross section. A comprehensive 3D mathematical model based upon the Abaqus software has been developed for the computation of the thermomechanical state of the solidifying strand during DC casting and subsequent cooling of rolling sheet ingots. Based upon a finite element formulation, the model determines the temperature distribution, the stresses and the associated deformations in the metal. This paper concentrates on the non-uniform contraction of the lateral faces and shows comparisons between computed and measured ingot cross-sections after complete cooling. Finally, the influence of the mold design on the final ingot cross-section is assessed and the use of an inverse method for mold design optimization is presented.

WATER COOLING IN DIRECT CHILL CASTING: PART 2, EFFECT ON BILLET HEAT FLOW AND SOLIDIFICATION</B> <I>John Grandfield</I>, Comalco Research Centre, P.O.Box 316, Thomastown, Victoria 3074, Australia
<P>
Water cooling plays an important role during DC casting. Control of the water cooling is essential for good process performance. In some cases the ability of the water cooling to remove heat limits productivity, and scrap can be generated due to variation in water cooling. The considerable work conducted to date on water cooling in DC casting is reviewed. The boiling theory is covered in a companion paper. Published measurements of cooling intensity and the affect of water cooling on the temperature distribution during casting are analysed. Various mold water system designs are discussed. The effect of variables such as water flow rate, impact velocity, composition, temperature etc are presented. Practical implications for controlling water cooling and the casting process are suggested.

CONSTITUTIVE MODELING OF HIGH-STRENGTH ALUMINUM CASTING: </B><I>Keh-Minn Chang</I>, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506; Jerry Harris, Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation, Ravenswood, WV 26506
<P>
High strength aluminum 7xxx alloys are susceptible to cracking during casting, and computational simulation is adapted to obtain better understanding and satisfactory control. Constitutive model of thermomechanical properties of the as-cast ingot is necessary for calculation of thermal stress developed after solidification. Considering the potential influence of precipitation, ingot properties are evaluated by a continuous cooling method, which allows controlled cooling at different rates to test temperatures of interest. The results indicate that thermomechanical behaviour of cast ingot remarkably differs from that of final wrought product. The relationship of mechanical properties are correlated with the microstructure of cast ingots.

3D ANALYSIS OF EM SEMI-LEVITATING AND FREE SURFACE PROBLEMS: </B>M. Ramadan Ahmed, Aluminum Co. of Egypt, 48/50 Abd El-Khalek Sarwat St., Cairo, Egypt; S. El-Masry, Faculty of Engineering &amp; Technology, Helwan, Egypt; Fawaz Moustafa, Ibrahim Moustafa, Egyptalum Company, Nag Hammady, Egypt
<P>
Developing an accurate mathematical model for the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) semi-levitating and free surface problems is still in the top of attentions for many researchers working in the field of the EM casting and others near-net-shape product applications. In this paper, a 3D iterative solution based on the Boundary Element technique coupled with a heat transfer analysis is derived for modeling an electromagnetic (EM) caster producing aluminum ingot installed in the Egyptalum Company. The main objective of this work is studying the effects of the EM screen location, the cooling system strategy and the melt withdrawal speed, and the effects of the estimated electrical setting parameters on the EM caster performance and its operation stability. The numerical results show that the location of the screen as well as the melt withdrawal speed have significant effects on the stability and the shape of the formed aluminum ingot. On the other hand, changing the supply frequency from 1500 Hz up to 2500 Hz increases the total electrical power consumed but it has no significant effect on the ingot shape. Finally, measurements showing a comparable reduction of 10% in the total electrical power consumed and a stable equilibrium free surface shape are recorded as the EM caster is tested, in the company, using those concluded setting parameters.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE ANGULAR WIDENING OF A CAST PLATE</B>: J. Stetina, <I>F. Kavicka</I>, Technical University of Brno, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Technicka 2, 616 69 Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC; J.M. Khodadadi, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849-5341<P>
A 2-D numerical model was used to analyze the temperature field of a vertically cast 1700x600x40mm plate with different angles of widening in its cross section (0 to 4.4&#176;). From the side of the widening, the plate was either isolated (using Plastizol) or non-isolated. A non-isolated plate has an optimum angular widening of 3&#176; and the widening of 2&#176; lies on the boundary of the origins of internal defects (e.g. shrinkages). The isolated plate has an optimum angle of widening of 2&#176;. Using the calculations it is possible to predict that the plate itself will have the same internal quality with a widening of 3&#176; after crystallization without isolation as with 2&#176; of widening with the isolation. The knowledge gained in this study can lead to the reducing of the volume of liquid metal needed and to the lowering of costs for working the surface.

Box 109600, West Palm Beach, FL 33410-9600<P>

The production of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl foils by conventional ingot metallurgy involves casting ingots, hot forging ingots into billets, followed by several hot rolling, heat treatment, and surface grinding sequences. These methods, however, can result in production losses in excess of 50%. Recently, researchers at NASA-Langley and Ribtec have developed the Plasma Melt Overflow Process which combines plasma arc skull melting in a water cooled copper crucible with Melt Overflow Rapid Solidification Technology (MORST) allowing near-net-shape processing of strips that can be hot pack rolled to foil gauge with minimal production losses. Preliminary results indicate that foils produced via this method exhibit finer more uniform microstructures, higher strength, and higher ductility than comparable ingot metallurgy foils. In this investigation texture evolution has been evaluated in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys sheets produced via this technique. The results are compared with recent studies of texture in conventionally processed <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl.

LIQUID METAL-SOLID METAL REACTIONS WITH INTERMEDIATE INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND FORMATION:</B> <I>Robert J. Hanrahan Jr</I>., Dan J. Thoma, Loren A. Jacobson, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Materials Science Technology Division-MST-6, TA 3, MS G770, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
The study of liquid metal reactions have in most cases involved systems where the solid is dissolved by the liquid. The case where an intermetallic compound forms between the two metals has not been thoroughly investigated. As an example of this class of system we have chosen to study the reaction of Beryllium (solid)--with Rare Earths (liquid). Although most of the Be-RE phase diagrams are poorly defined in terms of solubility and the location of the eutectics, all have been characterized to the extent of having a single intermetallic compound with a melting point in excess of 1500&#176;C and two simple eutectics with minimal solubility range in the solid phases. The intermetallic in each case is the same structure, Mbe13. The reaction kinetics, measured using the thickness of the intermetallic layer at various times, can be described by a parabolic model suggesting that the reaction is controlled by diffusion through the intermetallic. Variations in kinetics are observed between the various systems which are analyzed considering factors such as melting point of the liquid (eutectic temperature), Be solubility in the liquid, and compositional range of the intermetallic.

POTENTIAL OF SQUEEZE CASTING ALUMINUM (Al) AND ALUMINUM-REINFORCED METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES (Al-MMC) FOR BOTH THE AUTOMOTIVE AND ARMY GROUND VEHICLE APPLICATIONS:</B> <I> Paul J.

The main driving forces for lightweight materials for the automotive industry and military applications are cost effectiveness, high-strength, and wear resistance. Precision Metal Forming Company (PMF) has developed a new and innovative squeeze casting process called metal compression forming (MCF). MCF integrates the deceptively simple concept of solidification of metal under direct pressure with closed die forging and low-pressure permanent-mold fill technologies. This hybrid process therefore combines the advantages of traditional direct squeeze casting and low-pressure permanent-mold casting. This study discusses property advantages attained with this process over traditional aluminum casting processes.

KINETIC COMPETITION DURING DUPLEX PARTITIONLESS SOLIDIFICATION:</B> <I> Donald R. Allen, </I>John H. Perepezko, Dept. of Mat. Science and Eng., University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, WI 53706<P>
A structure composed of both partitionless face-centered cubic (fcc) and bodycentered cubic (bcc) phases has been observed following high undercooling solidification of nickel-vanadium (Ni-V) alloys for the composition range 4751.7 at.% V. Transmission electron microscopy analysis has identified regions in which fcc and bcc grains on the order of 100 nm in size coexist in a duplex structure. Splat-quenched foils were analyzed both in plan view and cross section. This structure has revealed a unique set of kinetic conditions that can allow for duplex solidification, since similar nucleation and growth rates are required for a range of compositions. A nucleation and growth kinetics analysis has been developed to describe the conditions under which this structure may form. The duplex partitionless structure previews an entirely new class of microstructures achievable during high undercooling solidification processing.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION IN Al-Cu-Si ALLOY MELT SPUN RIBBONS:</B> <I>K.-P. Cooper</I>, J D. Ayers, H.N. Jones, R. Vardiman, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6321, Washington, DC 20375-5343<P>
Several Al-Cu-Si alloys were melt spun to produce stable, fine grain microstructures that would be amenable to superplastic deformation and consolidation. Scanning electron microscopy of the ribbon cross-sections showed two distinct alternating microstructural morphologies suggesting transitions in solidification behavior. One consisted of intimately interlocked Al and A12Cu (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif">) phases with dispersed Si. The other consisted of equiaxed dendritic Al with inter-dendritic <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> and Si. The latter was found usually in the middle portion of the ribbon cross-section. The solidification mechanism for the interlocked structure is not understood, but its formation may have involved multiple nucleation of the phase or a degeneration of a more regular, but unknown, initial structure as the ribbon cooled to ambient temperature. The equiaxed dendritic structure probably arose as a result of independent nucleation events in the supercooled liquid ahead of the solid-liquid interface. Transmission electron microscopy revealed Al grain sizes varying from 1&#181;m near the wheelside to 8&#181;m with subgrains near the free surface and different shapes and sizes for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> and Si in the interlocked and dendritic regions.

HEAT TRANSFER AND SOLIDIFICATION IN UPCASTING OF COPPER:</B> K. Harkki, L. Holappa, Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Vuorimiehentie 2, FIN-02150 Espoo Finland<P>
An extensive study has been conducted to find out heat transfer and solidification behaviour in the copper upcasting mold. The casting direction in the upcasting process is vertically upwards and it has applications for copper and copper based alloys. The study combined industrial scale measurements, mathematical modeling and me/allographic examination of the cast rod samples. The industrial scale measurements involved temperature measurements with 14 thermocouples inserted in the copper jacket of the mold. Also temperature measurements of the cooling water were carried out. Axial heat flux profiles were determined quantitatively from the temperature measurements and they were used as boundary condition for the mathematical model calculations. The heat flux was observed to have a maximum value near the meniscus and to decrease rapidly with increasing distance up to the mold. Temperature profiles in the cast rod were simulated using a model based on finite element method. The results of the simulations were utilized for further understanding of the heat transfer and solidification process in the mold. Copper rod samples were examined to evaluate crystal growth of the cast copper rod. The results of the investigation work can be utilized to optimize the copper upcasting process.

RISERING EFFECT ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF ASTM F-75 INVESTMENT CASTINGS:</B> M. Castro, L.F. Ramirez, M. Herrera, H. Maucha, M. Mendez, J. Mendez, Centro de Investigacion y Estudios Avanzados del IPN-Unidad Saltillo, Carr. Saltillo-Monterrey Km. 13, 25000 Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico<P>
As-cast mechanical properties in dentritic alloys, as Co-based materials, are strongly dependent on the porosity level developed during the solidification process. High ductility levels can only be achieved when the porosity is completely eliminated. In such a high reactive materials, to avoid the problems conveyed by the high temperatures required to produce sound porosity-free castings, it is necessary to explore other solutions as those applied in conventional casting process for defect elimination. In this study, we report the effect of different size risers on the porosity formation in investment cast ASTMF-75 alloys. The liquid metal at 1430&#176;C was poured into cylindrical ceramic molds preheated at 900&#176;C. The morphology as well as the location of the porosity changed with the riser size. An intergranular porosity situated in the center section was observed when it was applied to the biggest size riser. When using the smallest size riser, an additional elongated, and peripherically situated porosity appeared. The observed changes in porosity are associated with the microstructural changes; while in the former case the grains are equiaxed, in the second case the grains are columnar. As the dendritic arm spacing showed that the cooling rate was very similar in both cases, the results are explained considering the nucleation mechanisms.

THE CONTROL OF DENDRITE TIP GROWTH RATE AS A WAY TO PROMOTE GOOD MICROSTRUCTURES IN DENRITIC ALLOYS:</B> H. Mancha, F. Cepeda, M. Herrera, J. Mendez, M. Castro, M.

As-cast mechanical properties, in particular ductility, of equiaxed and dendritic alloys such as Co-based alloys and Al-based alloys are strongly dependent on size and spatial distribution of second phase particles. In this paper, we present the results of a mathematical modeling study on the solidification process of these type of alloys. The effect of cooling parameters and nucleating conditions, in the grain growth kinetics of denritic structured grains, are presented and compared with experimental results. High nucleation rates as well as low cooling rates produce small grain size with large intergranular second phase particles. On the opposite side, low nucleation rates and high cooling rates allow the formation of large grain size with small fractions of intergranular second phase particles and high volume fractions of intragranular smaller second phase particles. These intragranular particles have a different chemical composition to those located in grain boundaries. In the case of Co-based alloys, it seems to be necessary to complete elimination of large intergranular lamellar structured carbides to obtain the 8 percent elongation to fracture established by the ASTM F-75 international standard. The grain growth kinetics control, based on the control of the dendrite tip growth rate, offers a way to obtain grain microstructures that allow the best as-cast mechanical properties. The same principle is applicable to the Al-based alloys. The mathematical model predictions on volume fraction and spatial distribution of second phase particles are discussed and compared with the experimental results.

MODELLING QUENCHED IN SHORT-RANGE ORDER IN METALLIC ALLOYS:</B> A. Varschavsky, E. Donoso, Universidad de Chile, Facultad de Ciencias Flsicas y Matematicas IDIEM, Casilla 1420, Santiago, Chile<P>
Using a rate vacancy loss equation and an overall rate constant for order establishment, a model for describing the roles of quench temperature, quench rate and vacancy sink density is proposed. This model allows computation of the retained value of the first short-range order parameter of quenched binary alloys and the prediction that the most highly disordered state obtainable occurs with quenches from intermediate temperatures. Numerical results were tested against experimental data based on energetic analysis of differential scanning calorimetric traces pertaining to a reordering process towards the equilibrium state. Kinetic evaluations of these traces yield experimental estimates of quenched-in vacancy concentrations. Good agreement between modelled and experimental assessments was obtained in Cu at.% Zn alloy.

KINETICS OF ATOMIC TRANSPORT IN THE FORMATION OF NONEQUILIBRIUM MATERIALS:</B> <I>Michael J. Aziz,</I> Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, 29 Oxford Street, Cambridge MA 02138
<P>
Rapid solidification can result in the production of nonequilibrium materials either primarily due to nucleation or primarily due to growth. Rapid growth can trap in solute or point defect supersaturations or chemical disorder, or can cause the formation of nonequilibrium microstructures. Additionally, large driving forces can permit the nucleation and growth of other metastable phases. The phenomenology and mechanisms for these processes will be discussed. Models and experiments will be reviewed.

<P>DEVIATIONS FROM LINEAR DIFFUSION DURING SOLID-STATE AMORPHIZATION IN Ni-Hf DIFFUSION COUPLES</B>: <I>M. Atzmon, </I>W.S.L. Boyer, The University of Michigan, Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2104
<P>
When analyzing diffusion measurements, the diffusion coefficient is often assumed to be independent of composition and time. In this paper, studies of possible deviations from this simple picture will be reported. During amorphous alloy growth in an elemental diffusion couple, the amorphous phase has a wide homogeneity range, and the interdiffusion coefficient is unlikely to be uniform. Experimental results in Ni-Hf thin-film couples will be described, which indicate that the interdiffusion coefficient varies significantly with composition. This variation leads to significant systematic errors in determining the interfacial compositions from measured composition profiles. A more reliable measurement method will be presented. A number of authors have suggested that evolution of macrostress during amorphization by interdiffusion affects the rate of the latter. Using a combination of substrate curvature and lattice parameter measurements, we have determined the evolution of stress during interdiffusion in Ni-Hf thin-film couples. The amorphous phase is observed to form under large tensile stress, which relaxes by creep during subsequent growth. Neither this stress, nor that induced by ion irradiation, affects the interdiffusion coefficient.

<P>SINTERING OF SMALL ASSEMBLIES:</B> <I>R.S. Averback</I>, Huilong Zhu, M. Yeadon, J.M. Gibson, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, 1304 W. Green St., Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
The sintering of small assemblies of nanoparticles has been investigated by a combination of molecular dynamics computer simulations and in situ observations in a UHV transmission electron microscope. Because the radius of curvature of nanoparticles is so small, enormously large interfacial stresses are developed when nanoparticles come in contact with other nanoparticles or substrates, and this leads to sintering by plastic deformation of the particles on the time scale of some picoseconds. Surprisingly, these particles rotate and form twins and other low energy configurations. Several examples of such sintering will be illustrated, including nanoparticle assemblies of Cu, amorphous alloys and intermetallic compounds. Interactions between nanoparticles and substrates will also be discussed.

<P>EFFECT OF FREE SURFACES ON THE KINETICS AND MORPHOLOGY OF SPINODAL DECOMPOSITION:</B> <I> Long-Qing Chen,</I> Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802
<P>
The kinetics of spinodal decomposition and morphological evolution near a crystalline surface were investigated by microscopic master equations in the point and pair approximations and a second-neighbor interaction model. Both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D model systems were considered. It is shown that, in the presence of a surface, spinodal decomposition initially involves surface segregation, followed by anisotropic decomposition in the near-surface region, and then followed by isotropic decomposition in the bulk. It is demonstrated that, due to segregation, a surface spinodal decomposition may take place for alloys whose overall average compositions are outside the bulk spinodal. It is found that the presence of a surface results in a dominant concentration wave which produces interesting transient morphological patterns such as distorted hexagonal precipitate lattices for relatively low-volume fractions and straight stripes at high volume fractions in the near-surface region. The relevance of these results to the mechanisms of diffusional phase transformations, such as spinodal ordering and decomposition, in nanoscale crystalline materials will be discussed.

<P><B>SELF-PROPAGATING REACTIONS IN NANOSCALE MULTILAYER MATERIALS:</B> <I> Tim Weihs</I>, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218
<P>
This presentation describes self-propagating, exothermic reactions in nanoscale, multilayer materials. The talk begins with a review of self-propagating reactions in powder-based materials and then focuses on similar exothermic reactions in multilayer foils. The multilayer foils consist of alternate layers of materials that have high heats of mixing, such as Al and Ni. The individual layers (of Al or Ni) are only nanometers thick, but hundreds of these layers are sputter deposited to form one foil with a total thickness between 10 and 100 microns. The layered foils arc easily removed from their substrates, and their exothermic mixing can be started at room temperature with a small spark. Te exothermic reactions propagate al speeds greater than 10m/s and they reach final temperatures as high us 1600&#176;C The reactions can propagate in air, vacuum, or liquids. The velocities, the heats, and the temperatures of the reactions will be presented for at least two different multilayer systems, and the chemical and structural parameters that control these properties will be addressed using an analytical model. The final segment of the talk will describe how reactive multilayer foils can be used as local heat sources to joint structural components.

Ying</I>, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307
<P>
Membranes are often fabricated from palladium since it has a very high hydrogen permselectivity. Diffusion through the metal is often the rate-limiting step in hydrogen transport through palladium-based membranes. The flux through these membranes can be increased by tailoring a microstructure that allows for higher hydrogen diffusivity. Nanostructured palladium has a much higher hydrogen diffusivity than conventional palladium due to its large volume fraction of grain boundaries. Thus, nanostructured metal membranes would provide higher hydrogen fluxes and better performance. By doping palladium with another element, enhanced stability against grain growth, stability against the alpha to beta phase transition which causes cracking, and enhanced poisoning resistance can be achieved. In this study nanostructured pure palladium and palladium alloy membranes were synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition. The hydrogen permselectivity through these materials was determined in a membrane reactor and the effect of common poisons (e.g. carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide) on hydrogen diffusivity was also measured to relate the hydrogen permeation properties of these materials to their microstructure and elemental composition.

ALUMINIUM-BASED NANOPHASE COMPOSITES BY DEVITRIFICATION:</B> <I>A.L. Greer</I>, University of Cambridge, Department of Materials Science &amp; Metallurgy, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, UK
<P>
Al-TM-Ln alloys (TM... transition metal; Ln...lanthanide) can be rapidly quenched into a fully amorphous state and then partially devitrified to give a nm-scale microstructure of aluminium crystallites uniformly dispersed in an amorphous matrix. This is a highly unusual microstructure for an aluminium alloy, indicating a high density of independent nucleation events in the glass. This study focuses on the development and stability of microstructure in a series of Al-Ni-Y alloys. The effects of various single- and two-stage heat treatments are explored. The emphasis is on the particular features associated with the unusual nm-scale among these is the overlap between coarsening and further transformation arising from capillarity effects on the crystallites.

KINETICS OF NANOPHASE CRYSTALLIZATION IN Al-Fe-Gd ALLOYS:</B> A.A. Csontos, <I>G.J. Shiflet,</I> Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
This presentation will provide results an the formation and subsequent growth of nanocrystalline aluminum phases in an amorphous matrix. A prototype for this family of metallic glass alloys that can be transformed into nanocrystalline material is the Al90Fe5Gd5 system. Detailed measurements of nanocrystalline isothermal growth from an amorphous Al90Fe5Gd5 matrix were made from 150 to 500&#176;C. Coupled with growth of the nanocrystals, measurements of Gd and Fe segregation between the nanocrystal and the matrix were secured in a TEM with a field emission gun. Both Fe and Gd are preferentially rejected into the remaining matrix as the aluminum-rich nanocrystal grows. After reaching a specific size, which varies with temperature, growth slows down and funkier changes are slight until subsequent nucleation and growth of compound phases. such as Al4Gd occur. The relative stability of the formation of nanocrystals from an amorphous matrix will be addressed. Research supported by the University of Virginia Academic Enhancement Program.

<P>
Aluminum-rich glasses containing about 85 at% Al and a combination of transition and rare earth element additions have yielded microstructures of Al nanocrystals in an amorphous matrix with nanocrystal volume fractions approaching 20% and excellent mechanical properties. A high density of nanocrystals (&gt;1020 m-3) develops during the primary crystallization reaction but growth is limited. A new kinetics analysis shows that diffusion field the nanocrystals. The kinetics model has been applied to DSC exotherms that correspond to primary fcc nanocrystal formation. A thermodynamic model of the fcc-liquid phase support heat evolution rate calculations used in the model. The results indicate that modification of the nucleant density should be the primary focus in limiting nanocrystal growth due to reduced length scales.

<B>3:20 pm <P>MICROSTRUCTURAL AND THERMAL ANALYSES OF CRYSTALLIZATION IN ULTRAFINE AMORPHOUS TITANIA PARTICLES:</B> J.-S. Yin, L. He, G.L. Griffin*, <I>E. Ma,</I> Mechanical Engineering, *Chemical Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803
<P>
Ultrafine amorphous titania particle aggregates, with a mean particle size of 145 nm, were prepared using a hydrolysis technique in an aerosol reactor. Their crystallization bahavior has been studied using transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The amorphous powder crystallized into anatase with a crystallization enthalpy of 27 kJ/mol and an apparent activation energy of 2.0 eV. The anatase phase nucleated preferentially in contact regions between neighbouring particles. This crystallization mode is interpreted as a consequence of the presence of appreciable local pressure (stress) which was predicted by model calculations and observed under TEM. An analysis suggests that the pressure effect reduces the relative stability of the amorphous phase by enhancing the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and possibly also the crystallization kinetics. The nucleation and growth behavior observed has important implications when these amorphous particles are used as precusors to form nanocrystalline titania. The results are also discussed in comparison with the crystallization behavior reported previously for other ultrafine-structured oxides.

PRESSURE INDUCED CRYSTAL-TO-AMORPHOUS TRANSFORMATIONS:</B> <I>R.B. Schwarz</I>, P.J. Yvon*, Center for Materials Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, *Present address: SRMA, Centre d'Etudes Saclay 91191 Gif/Yvette, France
<P>
Pressure-induced crystal-to-glass transformations have been observed in tetrahedrally coordinated elements (e.g. Ge, Si), ionic and molecular crystals (alpha-SiO2, FeSiO4, AlPO4, Fe PO4, SnBr4), and hydroxides (ice, Ca(OH)2, Co(OH)2). In these materials, the crystal transforms polymorphically to a higher density glassy phase. Crystal-to-glass transformation have also been observed to occur through pressure-induced reactions between mixtures of elements such as germanium and aluminum. This paper reviews the formation of amorphous phases in alloys and elemental mixtures and discusses the possibility of obtaining bulk amounts of amorphous phases.

STABLE VS. METASTABLE PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN FACETED/NON-FACETED METALLIC GLASS SYSTEMS:</B> <I> T.M. Adams, </I>M.J. Kaufman, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611
<P>
Since metallic glasses can be used as precursors for nanocrystalline structures, it is important to understand the relationship between the transformation characteristics of the stable faceting phases and the metastable ordered phases (MOP's) in faceted/non-faceted systems. Such an understanding of the competitive nucleation and growth kinetics should allow better control of the transformation structures. Following some past work on Al-Ge alloys, it has been proposed that, in general, for faceted/non-faceted systems, no equilibria exist between the MOP's and the stable faceted phases. In order to support this assertion of generality, the Hf-Be and Al-Ge systems are being investigated. Crystallization of amorphous melt spun ribbons and co-evaporated thin films is effected by standard furnace anneals and in-situ electron beam heating. Once annealed, the resulting microstructures are characterized using XRD and TEM. In addition, <I>in-situ</I> hot-stage TEM is used to examine the relationship between the MOP and the stable faceting phase while the transformations are occurring. All of this work is being done in the vicinity of the stoichiometric composition of the most stable MOP (Hf-50Be and Al-50Ge). Basic modelling efforts of the metastable phase equilibria are also under way using THERMOCALC with estimated heats of formation for the MOP's determined through DSC/DTA and empirical formulations.

STRUCTURAL TRANSITIONS IN TI/AL NANOLAYERED THIN FILMS:</B> <I>R. Banerjee</I>, X.D. Zhang and H. L. Fraser, Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; M. Asta, A.A. Quong, Computational Materials Science, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, R. Ahuja, Multi Arc Scientific Coatings, Troy, MI
<P>
Nanolayered materials often exhibit unusual structural features which are significantly different from those of their bulk counterparts. Such structural transitions could lead to novel properties of the material motivating research directed towards engineering the structure at the nanoscale. Laminated thin films based on Ti, Al and Ti-aluminides have potential application as coatings for components used in high temperature aerospace applications. A series of structural transitions were observed in Ti/Al multilayered thin films on reducing the layer thickness of the Ti and Al layers1. An hcp-fcc transition was found to occur in the Ti layers on reduction of the layer thickness to 5 nm. Al too exhibited an fcc-hcp transition on reducing the layer thickness to 2.5 nm. Interestingly, a 2.5 nm Ti layer had an hcp structure. An atempt was made to explain these transformations in the stacking sequence of the Ti and Al layers using a model initially proposed by Redfield and Zangwill. Subsequently, first principles electronic structure calculations are in progress to determine the effect of bulk, interfacial and thin film strain energies on the structural stability of the multilayers. Initial results suggest that strain energy may be playing a pivotal role in determining the structure.

NANOSTRUCTURES AND PROPERTIES IN RAPIDLY SOLIDIFIED Ti(50)Ni(50-X)Cu(X) ALLOYS</B>:<I> V.G. Pushin</I> , S.B. Volkova, N.M. Matveeva*, A.S.

<P>
Rapidly solidified Ti-Ni-Cu alloys prepared by melt spinning were studied. It is found that under super rapid cooling rates alloys with 25-40 at% Cu are formed in initial amorphous state, with 15-25 at% Cu in amorphous-crystalline state, with 15 at% Cu don't become amorphous under spinning. Crystallization heat treatment of amorphous alloys leads to the formation of nano-scale TiNi-based solid solution, which undergo martensitic B2-&gt;B19 martensitic transition in cooling. Temperatures of martensitic transformations for RS-alloys have been established to be lower, than for same alloys prepared under traditional cooling rates, because of nano-scale grain size of B2-phase crystalizing from amorphous structure. The martensite in a nano- and micro grains may have different morphology and orientations. Nanophase (B2-TiNiCu) and nanocomposite (B2+B11(TiCu)) structures formed under crystallization by means of laser treatment, heating effect of electrical current and high temperature treatment were investigated. The ribbons with such structures in optimum state have good elastic and shape memory properties.

STRUCTURE, MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, AND FRACTURE IN NANOPHASE SILICON NITRIDE: MILLION ATOM MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS ON PARALLEL COMPUTERS:</B> <I>Rajiv K. Kalia</I>, Aiichiro Nakano, Andrey Omeltchenko, Kenji Tsuruta, Priya Vashishta, Concurrent Computing Laboratory for Materials Simulations, Physics and Astronomy, Computer Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803<P>
Structure, mechanical properties, and dynamic fracture in nanocluster-assembled silicon nitride are investigated with molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations involving 1.08 million particles. The simulations reveal that intercluster regions in the consolidated nanophase Si3N4 are highly disordered with 50% undercoordinated atoms. These disordered interfacial regions deflect cracks and give rise to local crack branching. As a result, the nanophase system is able to sustain an order-of- magnitude larger external strain than the crystalline Si3N4. We also investigate the morphology of fracture surfaces in nanophase Si3N4. The MD results for roughness exponents are very close to experimental values [P. Daguier et al., Europhys. Lett. 31, 367 (1995)] even though the materials and length scales are very different.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF NANOPHASE CERAMICS:</B> <I> Paul G. Klemens</I>, Physics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-3046<P>
Heat conduction of insulators is by lattice waves (phonons), which have a wide frequency spectrum. The mean free path of phonons is limited by anharmonic intereactions and by scattering, principally scattering by point defects, and by grain boundaries and other etended imperfections. Point defects reduce the mean free path and the contribution to the conductivity of high frequency phonons; grain boundaries that of low frequency phonons. These reductions in conductivity will be discussed. They are additive in materials of micron-sized grains, but not in nanophase materials, where the frequency ranges of phonons affected by point defects and by grain boundary scattering may overlap. The effect of phonon scattering on the thermal conductivy will be discussed with reference to solutes, non-stoichiometry, grain size, and radiation damage.

A SIMULATION STUDY ON THE MELTING OF NANOCRYSTALLINE PLATES AND SPHERICAL CLUSTERS:</B> <I>J.K.

As an emerging mass-data storage technology, phase change (PC) optical recording makes use of the difference in reflectivity between the amorphous and crystalline state of chalcogenide thin films. The amorphous state is obtained via laser melting and subsequent rapid cooling. For a better understanding of the melting behavior of such nanocrystalline plates, a Lennard-Jonesian fcc solid is studied using the method of molecular dynamics. Unlike the bulk case, it is shown that a plate melting is accompanied by a gradual change in both the volume and enthalpy. The melting point of a plate decreases as a function of h**(-n), where h is the thickness and n is 0.7. If the thickness becomes 15 lattice parameters, the melting point reaches a plateau. (111) plates show slightly higher melting points than those for (100) plates. The melting points of spherical clusters with radii ranging from 1.4 to 6.4 lattice parameters show a r**(-n) dependence, where r is the radius and n is 0.75.

EVIDENCE FOR THERMODYNAMIC STABILIZATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN Pd1-<I>x</I>Zr<I>x</I>:</B> <I>C.E. Krill</I>, H. Ehrhardt, R. Birringer, Unversit&auml;t des Saarlandes, FB10 Physik, Postfach 151150, Geb&auml;ude 43, D&#173;66041 Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany<P>
The rate of grain growth in a crystalline material is proportional to both the mobility and energy of its grain boundaries. Standard techniques for hindering grain growth, such as solute drag, are kinetic in nature: that is, they aim to reduce the mobility term. A thermodynamic approach, however, should be just as effective: a reduction in grain-boundary energy would be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the driving force for grain growth. According to the Gibbs adsorption theorem, grain-boundary energies can be reduced by introducing a component that tends to segregate to the grain boundaries. We have investigated ball-milled solid solution of Pd1-xZrz for signs of improved stability against grain growth with increasing Zr concentration; the growth rate is observed to drop to very low values for x greater than 0.2. Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to estimate the concentration dependence of the grain-boundary energy, thereby isolating the themodynamic contribution to grain-growth stability from that due to solute drag.

VIBRATIONAL DENSITY OF STATES OF NANOCRYSTALLINE Ni3Fe PREPARED BY HIGH ENERGY BALL MILLING: </B> H. Frase, L.J. Nagel, J.L. Robertson, B. Fultz, California Institute of Technology, mail 138-78, Pasadena, CA 91125; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Solid Sate Physics Division, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831<P>

We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on two states of Ni3Fe: 1) as-milled, when the material had a characteristic nanocrystallite size of 9 nm, and 2) annealed, when the material had a characteristic crystallite size of 30 nm. The nanophase material showed an enhancement by a factor of 2 in its density of states at energies below 15 meV, and some broadening of its longitudinal peak at 33 meV. The large enhancement in the density of states at these low energies appears to require coupling between inter- and intra-crystallite vibrational motions. The inter-crystalline modes would be associated with the vibrations of the crystallites themselves. These measured changes in vibrational DOS predict a difference in vibrational entropy of the bulk and nanocystalline Ni3Fe of about 0.18 kB/atom at high temperatures, with the nanocrystalline materials having the larger vibrational entropy. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-FG03-86ER45270.

 FUNCTIONAL CERAMICS USING NANOMETER-SIZED MATERIALS:</B> <I>Manu Multani</I>, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay 400 005, India<P>
Working with a range of current ceramic materials with a wide variety of applications, it is shown that considerable improvements can be obtained when one starts with Small Solid State Systems (S4) Materials studied range from doped ZnO varistors, PZT piezoelectrics, YIG microwave materials, and the new superconductors. General principles underlying these changes are shown to be dependent on the dispersion relations of phonons and wavevectors (for ferroelectrics) and magnons and wavevectors (for ferromagnetics). Another S4 rule that we have found applicable for most oxides is the tendency towards higher symmetry and increasing unit-cell-volume with decreasing size of the S4s. These changes may usher in phase transformation(s) and size dependent phase transition temperatures.

COMBUSTION FLAME SYNTHESIS OF NANOPHASE MATERIALS:</B> B.H. Kear*, G. Skandan***, N. Glumac**, and Y. Che*, *Ceramics, **Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University, NJ, ***Nanopowder Enterprises, Inc. Piscataway, NJ
<P>
Non-agglomerated nanopowders are becoming increasingly important for a number of commercial applications including UV-scattering, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), displays and catalysis, among others. We have developed a continuous nanopowder production process, called Chemical Vapor Condensation (CVC), which involves precursor pyrolysis and condensation in a reduced pressure environment. We have introduced a flat-flame combustor unit, operable at low pressures, as a heat source in place of the original hot wall reactor. The temperature profile is uniform across the entire face of the burner, therefore, the reactants experience the same processing history and the powder has a uniform particle size distribution. The modified process, called Combustion Flame-Chemical Vapor Condensation (CF-CVC), has been used to produce a range of non-agglomerated nanoparticles (3-50 nm average particle size) of single phase, multiphase, and multicomponent materials. Examples include Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3/SiO2 and Eu:Y2O3. The as-synthesized powder is fully pyrolyzed (characterized by TGA), has a high surface area (SiO2 &gt; 300 m2/g; TiO2 &gt; 80 m2/g), and is non-agglomerated (TEM and BET pore size distribution). In addition, when the superheated particles leaving the combustion flame impinge on a heated substrate, in situ sintering can occur. Nanoporous or dense films or multilayered thin film structures can be synthesized. We have demonstrated the scalability of the process by increasing the burner diameter. Design consideration, processing parameters, powder characteristics and the commercial potential for the powders will be discussed. This work is supported in part by the Office of Naval Research contract #N00014-95-C-0283.

Nanostructured Materials present very unique properties which has allow several technological applications. In the case of chemical reactions nanostructured materials have been used as catalyst. It is know that reduction of the particle size to a few nanometers produce an increased catalytic activity. The origin of this activity has been attributed to the increase surface area. We will show in this paper that nanoparticles present an increased surface roughness. This roughness increases the number of kink which provide an excellent site for promoting chemical reactions. In order to characterized the roughness we have used a new technique which combines High Resolution Electron Microscopy with computer length, It will be also shown that in several cases, the particle size in the image do Dot correspond with the true particle size. A method to correct this problem will be discussed.

Nanostructured M50 type steel materials were prepared by hot pressing the precursor powders chemically synthesized using two different techniques, namely, thermal decomposition and co-reduction. During the hot press process, the precursor powders were transformed to nanocrystalline phases with the precipitation of carbides. Simultaneously the crystalline powders were densified. The densified samples were studied using both conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The effects of hot pressing temperature, time and pressure on the evolution of nanostructures, grain growth and defects formation are discussed.

Nanostructure W/Cu/Co alloy was developed by thermochemical processing method using metallic salt precursors as the starting material for improving thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. Nanostructure W/Cu/Co powder have loosely agglomerated homogeneous clusters of nanoscale size W(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 50 nm), Cu. and Co particles. The density and microhardness of the sintered nanostructure W/Cu/Co increased with increasing of Co content from 0.1 to 0.7wt.%, but electrical conductivity drastically decreased with addition of Co. Full density for nanostructure W/Cu/Co was achieved when sintered at 1473K for 20 minutes in H2 atmosphere with addition of 0.5wt.%Co. It was proved that optimum Co content is under 0.5wt.% when based on the relations between electrical conductivity and density. It is shown that nanostructure W/Cu/Co have higher sinterability and better electrical conductivity than conventional W/Cu/Co.

The mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline intermetallic and multiphase materials has been investigated using disk bend, tensile, and compression techniques. Materials such as NiAl, TiAl, Al-Al3Zr, and Cu-SiOx were synthesized by the gas-condensation technique using electron beam heating. Disk bend tests of nanocrystalline NiAl and TiAl showed evidence of improve ductility at room temperature in these normally extremely brittle materials. In contrast, tensile tests of multiphase nanocrystalline Al-Al3Zr samples showed significant increases in strength, but substantial reductions in ductility with decreasing grain size. Results from compression tests of nanocrystalline Cu and Cu-SiOx will also be described. Implications for the operable deformation mechanisms in these materials will be discussed. *This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, BES-Materials Science, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38, the Alcoa Corporation, and by AFOSR Grant # FY9620-92-J.

INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING ON INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF NANOCRYSTALLINE Ni:</B> <I>B.R. Elliott</I>, and J.R. Weertman, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL , Metallurgy Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001
<P>
Different processing routes can vary the internal structure of nanocrystalline compacts. As a result a single grain size measurement is insufficient to interpret mechanical property results. Blind comparison between samples with different processing histories may be hazardous since their internal structures (grain size distribution, grain boundary character, pore size distribution, adsorbed or chemically bonded impurities) are shown to vary. In particular, annealing samples to grow the grain size for producing Hall-Petch plots is shown to drastically change the pore size distribution and density in powder compacted samples that are not outgasssed prior to compaction. Improvements in processing, particularly compaction procedure, are illustrated by microscopy, XRD, SANS, PGAA, FNAA, archimedes density, and indentation tests. It is shown that with care and knowledge of the process inert gas condensed and compacted samples can be produced with few extrinsic defects.

The influence of improved processing on the internal structure of n-Ni has lead to improved mechanical properties. Correlation between the internal structure (including grain size, pore size distribution, and impurities) and results of a variety of mechanical properties measurements will be presented including hardness, tensile and compression tests. Some comparison will also be made between samples produced by traditional inert gas condensation (IGC) and the newer jet blown arc IGC. (JBA-IGC). Possible deformation mechanisms will be discussed in light of the structure and property measurements.

A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE WILLIAMSON-HALL METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL STRESS IN NANOCRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES:</B> <I>F.S. Miller</I>, D.C. Van Aken, Metallurgical Engineering, E.W. Bohannan, J.A. Switzer, Chemistry, The University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO 65409
<P>
An important aspect of the processing&lt;&#173;&gt;microstructure&lt;&#173;&gt;property relationships is the characterization of nanocrystalline structures by x-ray diffraction. The Williamson-Hall analysis is often used to deconvolute the line broadening effects of grain size and residual stress. In this study, Cu/Cu2O nanocrystalline films were produced by electro deposition. This technique produces a composite structure consisting of pure Cu and Cu2O grains each with diameters in the range of 10 to 20 nm. Electro deposited films were characterized by x-ray diffraction to determine both grain size and residual stress. The Williamson-Hall analysis was tested by direct measurement of the grain size by TEM and by using thermal treatments to vary the state of residual stress in the films.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Cu/Ag MULTI-LAYER COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Qing Zhai</I>, Augusto Morrone, Fereshted Ebrahimi, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611
<P>
When materials microstructure reaches nanometer scale, their properties often appear to be unusual, which cast much consideration these days. Specifically, the extraordinarily high strength has been the subject of many recent investigations. The nanomaterials discussed in this paper is a Cu/Ag multi-layered composite, which is produced by electrodeposition in a single-bath cyanide solution. In this paper the effects of copper layer thickness and heat treatment on interfacial structure and mechanical properties of Cu/Ag multi-layered composites are presented. Tensile testing was used to investigate the mechanical properties of the samples. SEM, X-ray diffraction and TEM were used to analyze the relation between the mechanical properties and microstructure of these composites.

STABILITY OF NANOCRYSTALLINE ALLOYED AND MULTILAYER PVD NITRIDE FILMS:</B> <I>R. A. Andrievski</I>, Institute for New Chemical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, 14232 Russia
<P>
The alloyed and multilayer films of TiN, ZrN, NbN, and CrN with nanocrystalline structure prepared by arc deposition were investigated by XRD, electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. A general tendency of the microhardness to increase with decreasing layer thickness was found in TiN-NbN(ZrN) systems. The unmonotonous change has been revealed in TiN-CrN one. The influence of spinodal decomposition, recrystallization, and heterodiffusion on the films' properties is also demonstrated and discussed in detail.

MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BULK NANOSTRUCTURED Fe/Cu ALLOYS:</B> <I>Walter W. Milligan</I>, John E. Carsley, Stephen A. Hackney, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Elias C. Aifantis, Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931<P>
The mechanical behavior of bulk iron alloys containing 10% copper was investigated. Grain sizes were varied by processing, and ranged from 45 nm to 900 nm. Deformation in all cases occurred by intense localized shear banding as the first and only mechanism of plastic deformation, from the yield point until fracture or buckling. Mechanical response was elastic-perfectly plastic. Shear band angles and an asymmetry of the yield strength in tension and compression both indicated the possibility of a pressure-sensitive yield criterion. Continuum models based on this approach proved promising. Shear band widths increased with microstructural coarseness, and were correlated successfully with a gradient plasticity approach. A number of similarities between the behavior of these alloys and amorphous materials such as metallic glasses and amorphous polymers will be discussed.

DEFORMATION MECHANISMS IN METALLIC NANOLAMINATES</B>: <I>Tim Foecke</I>, Metallurgy Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001<P>
It has been seen that the introduction of a nanolayered microstructure can increase the yield strength and hardness of a material to many times that of a conventional microstructure. The deformation mechanisms that operate (or fail to operate) at such a small length scale is not understood and is only beginning to be investigated. An in situ TEM deformation experiment has revealed a dislocation generation mechanism that operates in Cu/Ni single crystal nanolaminates. Dislocation loops nucleated at several locations within a Ni layer at the Cu/Ni interface, and were seen to expand until they intersected the next interface. Two Orowan bows were then seen to expand in opposite directions along the layer. Discussion will include possible nucleation sites and thin film artifacts, as well as presentation of other TEM observations of fracture and deformation in metallic nanolaminates.

DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF HIGH-STRENGTH Al94(V2,Ti)4Fe2 ALLOYS CONSISTING OF NANOGRANULAR AMORPHOUS AND Al PHASES:</B> <I> Akihisa Inoue</I>, Hisamichi Kimura and Kenichiro Sasamori, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-77, Japan<P>
A new mixed structure consisting of nanogranular amorphous and fcc-Al phases was formed in melt-spun Al94V4Fe2 and Al94V2Ti2Fe2 alloys and the complete replacement of V by Ti causes the change into a mixed structure of nanogranular Al phase surrounded by an amorphous phase. The structural change appears to result from the difference in solidification processes, i.e., the formation of the amorphous phase as a primary phase, followed by the Al phase for the V-containing alloys and the primary formation of the Al phases and then the amorphous phase for the V-free alloy. The former type is a unique process which is observed in the limited alloys containing V with icosahedral-forming ability and low diffusivity. The coexistence of the nanogranular amorphous phase is expected to affect significantly the mechanical strength, deformation behavior and fracture mode. These mixed phase alloys have good bending ductility and exhibit high tensile strength of 1390 MPa for Al94V4Fe2, 1370 MPa for Al94V2Ti2Fe2 and 1320 MPa for Al94Ti4Fe2 at room temperature. The fracture mode is analogous to that for amorphous alloys. At the meeting, we will report the detailed results on the temperature dependence of mechanical strength, deformation behavior and fracture mode for the nanogranular amorphous alloys.

FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF NANOCRYSTALLINE AND ULTRAFINE-GRAINED Cu:</B> <I>S.R. Agnew</I>1, R.Z. Valiev2, J.R. Weertman1, 1Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, 2Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ufa, Russia<P>
One of the tests that can give insight into the deformation mechanisms of nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained metals is fatigue. In the past, we investigated the microstructural stability of nanocrystalline (~20nm) Cu under cyclic loading. We observed good stability of the microstructure using XRD. An SEM study revealed extrusions on the surface, similar to those of persistent slip bands, oriented in the direction of maximum shear. The presence of extrusions suggests deformation by a shearing process. To augment our understanding of this phenomenon, we have begun studying the fatigue behavior of UFG Cu with a grain size of about 200nm. There we have observed similar extrusions as in the previous study. We are investigating the microstructural stability of this metal using the TEM. We will discuss our experimental results and their contribution to our understanding of the deformation mechanisms operative in pure FCC metals with ultra-fine microstructures.

COHERENT SOLUBILITY LIMITS OF <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">'-TYPE PHASES IN FOUR BINARY Ni-BASE ALLOYS:</B> <I>F. Li</I> and A.J. Ardell, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1595
<P>
The equilibrium solubilities of coherent phases can be affected by the initial solute concentration of the alloy, Xo. This differs completely from incoherent equilibrium, wherein the solubility limits are independent of Xo. To investigate the relationship between coherent equilibrium solubility and Xo, Ni-Al, Ni-Ga, Ni-Ge and Ni-Ti alloys, each with several different values of Xo, were prepared by arc melting, rolling into sheet, solution, treating, and aging for times up to 1632h at 500&#176;C. The variation of solute concentration in the Ni-rich matrix, X, with aging time, t, was followed using measurements of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature. The equilibrium solubilities, Xeq, were estimated by plotting the data as X vs. t-1/3 and extrapolating to t-1/3=0 (t=<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/infinity.gif">), thus presupposing that coarsening of the expected <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">'-type phases in all four alloys is responsible for the variation of X. Xeq is unequivocally dependent on Xo, but whereas Xeq in the Ni-Al, Ni-Ga and Ni-Ti alloys increases with increasing Xo as predicted theoretically by Ardell and Maheshwari, Xeq in the Ni-Ge alloy system decreases. TEM is currently in progress to confirm the identity and state of coherency of the precipitate phases present. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation

SYNTHESIS, STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF Cu/Nb NANOLAYERED COMPOSITES:</B> <I>H. Kung</I>, A.J. Griffin, Jr., Y.C. Lu, M.F. Hundley, T.-E.Mitchell, M. Nastasi, Los Alamos National Laboratory, MS K765 Los Alamos, NM
<P>
The effect of composition wavelength (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif">) on the structure, electrical resistivities and mechanical properties of Cu/Nb nanolayered composites were evaluated. The as- sputtered multilayers, with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif"> varying between 25&Aring; and 1000&Aring;, exhibit a strong Kurjudmov-Sachs orientation relationship between the close packed planes and directions of the fcc Cu and bcc Nb: &lt;110&gt;{111}Cu//&lt;111&gt;{l10}Nb. As ~decreases to 11&Aring;, the entire multilayer shows bcc structure. The Cu grows pseudomorphically on the bcc Nb which acts as a template for the normally fcc Cu. The layers are heavily strained and there is a high density of dislocations present. As <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif"> increases from 11&Aring; to 25&Aring;, it is suspected that there is enough loss of coherency to transform bcc Cu martensitically to fcc Cu. The mechanical and electrical properties of nanolayered Cu/Nb composites with Cu in either fcc or bcc structure will be reported.

RESISTANCE BEHAVIOR OF Cr-Si-O THIN FILMS</B>: <I>Alan F. Jankowski</I>, Jeffrey P. Hayes, Ronald Musket, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O.

<P>
Thin coatings of Cr-Si-O are assessed for use as a resistor. The submicron thick films are sputter deposited using a working gas mixture of (1-x)Ar-(x)O2. Several sintered-compacts of metal and oxide powders are commercially prepared for use as the sputter targets. The deposition process yields a range of film compositions which consist of 2-30 at.% Cr and 20-45 at.% Si as measured using Rutherford Back Scattering. A broad range of resistance values (101 to 1014 Ohm-cm) are found as measured by point contact with metal pads deposited onto the Cr-Si-O film surface. The film structure and morphology is characterized using transmission electron microscopy from which the resistance behavior can be correlated to the distribution of metallic-Cr. Thermal aging reveals metastability in the Cr-Si-O film morpholgy and resistance behavior.

<P>
Presently, nanostructured GaN composite was prepared using a novel synthetic route. GaN nanocrystals were imbedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) thin film matrix (GaN/PMMA) and then studied from structural and optical point of views. X-ray powder diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were performed to analyze the microstructure while the optical properties were measured by optical absorption and photoluminescence. Microstructural analyses showed that the GaN nanocrystallites imbedded in the PMMA matrix have an average size of about 5.5 nm and crystallize in the zinc blende lattice (lattice constant <I>a </I>close to 0.45 nm) with some nitrogen vacancies and structural imperfections. Optical absorption measurements indicate that the band gap energy of the GaN/PMMA composite is approximately 3.51 eV.

ANELASTIC AND MAGNETOELASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF BULK NANOPHASE MATERIALS:</B> <I>E. Bonetti</I>, L. Del Bianco, Dipartimento di Fisica and Istituto Nazionale per la Fisica della Materia, viale Berti Pichat 6/2 I-409128 Bologna, Italy
<P>
Mechanical spectroscopy techniques have been employed to investigate the anelastic and magnetoelastic behavior of bulk nanophase Fe and Fe-Al prepared by mechanical alloying and FeCuNbSiB granular alloys obtained starting from amorphous precursors through thermal treatments. The different magnetic states of the materials lead to strong modifications of the anelasticity spectra. The experimental results are presented and discussed with specific reference to the following to aspects : a) magnetoelastic coupling and giant DE effect in the FeCuNbSiB system occurring just below the nanocrystallization temperature, b) giant modulus enhancement in bulk iron and iron-aluminum alloys linked to changes of the magnetic behavior connected to grain size reduction and interfacial structure relaxation. <P><B>10:10 am BREAK <P>10:25 am

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF GRANULAR Co-Cu ULTRATHIN FILMS:</B> <I>A. Cabbibo</I>, Y.D. Park, J.A. Caballero, J.R. Childress, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-2066
<P>
Ultrathin (&lt;10nm) films and multilayers of granular Co-Cu composites have been prepared by co-sputtering. Nanoscale Co particles are formed in Cu by depositing on heated substrates (TS&gt;100C), with the usual increase in magnetic coercivity Hc, and superparamagnetic behavior above a critical blocking temperature (Tb) which depends on the partical size, shape, and local magnetic environment. We find that the confinement of the granular layer to thicknesses near the particle size induces variation in Hc and Tb due to changes in particle shape, magnetic anisotropy and inter-particle interactions. By varying the composition and thickness of both magnetic layer and interlayer, as well as the deposition conditions, one can identify conditions under which then magnetic granular layers can be fabricated with large anisotropy and therefore increased blocking temperature, without the need for post-deposition high-temperature processing. Such layers are designed to be used in magnetoresistive spin-valve multilayer structures.

<P>
Recent results of high-resolution and in situ transmission and scanning electron microscopy, diffraction of X-rays and electrons, physical and mechanical tests on high T-c superconducting ceramic compounds of Yba (2)Cu(3)O(7-x), including thick ceramic films synthesided on ZrO(2), are presented. The main types of atomic structures, structural defects, secondary phase inclusions are systematized. It is shown that grain structure of ceramics in form of the polyhedral matrix crystallites divided by grain boundaries is characterized by a porosity and secondary phase inclusions, which exist inside grains and between them. In some cases the inclusions of amorphous phase were detected. The peculiarities of high-resolution TEM of investigated ceramic compounds are discussed. The pretransition phenomena and phase martensite-like transformations in high-Tc superconducting ceramics and classical high-Tc intermetallic compounds of type A15 (V(3)Si, Nb(3)Sn, V(3)Ge) and C15(V(2)Zr, V(2)Zr, V(2)Hf) are compared.

LOW FREQUENCY INTERNAL FRICTION STUDIES OF NANOCRYSTALLINE COPPER-IRON MATERIALS:</B> <I>W.N. Weins</I>, J.D. Makinson, R.J. DeAngelis, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Center for Materials Research and Analysis, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68588-0656
<P>
The low-frequency internal friction behavior of mechanically milled copper and copper-30 wt% iron alloys was studied over a temperature range of 100-700&#176;K and a frequency range of approximately 1 to 3 Hz. Alloys were prepared by consolidating mechanically milled and alloyed powders using hot isostatic pressing to form compacts from which bars were machined for testing. Samples studied included unmilled copper, milled copper and milled copper-30 wt% iron. All powders were consolidated at 600&#176;C and diffracting particle size of the consolidated material varied from 18-30 nm. The internal friction studies indicated the presence of a large grain boundary peak in all samples at approximately 300&#176;C which increased with decreasing particle and grain size. The presence of iron appears to depress this peak and cause the occurrence of a second smaller high temperature peak in the range of 400-500&#176;C, which is believed to be associated with iron in solid solution. <P>

Zurek, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), MST-5, G755, Los Alamos, NM 87545; Frank Addessio, Todd O. Williams, T-3, B-216, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
The double cantilever beam (DCB) test is widely used to characterize the mode I delamination and bridging behavior of laminated continuous fiber composite materials. Many composite systems exhibit significant large scale fiber bridging that is not included in the derivation of the analysis methods. The bridging contribution to fracture energy is statistical in nature. A comparison is made of several analysis methods for applicability to systems exhibiting significant fiber bridging. A general DCB analysis method is described that takes into account loading pin effects, material orthotropy, crack root inelasticity, and large scale deformation behind the crack faces. Some material system specific characteristics that lead to enhanced fiber bridging are described.<B>

HYGRO-MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF A CLASS OF SWELLING-TYPE THREE-DIMENSIONALLY BRAIDED COMPOSITES: </B>Surya R. Kalidindi, Abdel Abusaifeh, Materials Engineering Department Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
A new class of swelling-type composite materials using three-dimensionally braided graphite or Kevlar fibers have been designed and processed for potential applications in bone implants. These composites derive their swelling from the hydrophillic nature of the matrix material used in their production. A combined experimental and modeling study was undertaken to study the hygro-mechanical behavior of this class of materials. The properties of interest included the swelling strains, elastic properties, yield strengths, and impact strengths. Note that these properties for the braided composites are highly anisotropic. Furthermore, the mechanical properties are strongly affected by the amount of absorbed water. Cylindrical samples of braided composites were produced with varying fiber volume fractions, braid angles, fiber type (graphite and Kevlar), matrix cross-linking (to control the degree of swelling in the composite), and fiber architecture (uniaxial, rectangular braided, and circular braided). Swelling strains at saturation were measured in these samples. Simple compression tests were performed on these samples in at least two principal material directions in both dry and saturated conditions. Elastic moduli and yield strengths were extracted from these tests. Cylindrical samples of the matrix material (without fibers) were also produced and utilized to fully characterize the hygro-mechanical behavior of the matrix material. Constitutive models have been proposed to predict the various hygro-mechanical properties of the 3-D braided composites in both dry and saturated states as a function of the fiber and matrix properties, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientations. A weighted average of the currently employed isostrain and isostress models in literature for this class of materials was found to consistently yield better predictions for the anisotropic elastic moduli, when compared to the predictions of either of these models. The weighting factor was found to be dependent primarily on the fiber and matrix materials (i.e. independent of the type of loading, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientation) and has been interpreted as an interaction parameter between the various fiber and matrix systems. These models were then extended to predict the swelling behavior and yield strengths of the 3-D braided composites. The accuracies of the proposed models were evaluated by comparisons against experimental measurements described above as well as the predictions from a finite element simulation of the response of a representative unit-cell of the braided composite. These comparisons revealed that the proposed models are reasonably accurate in their predictions.

<P>
A critical component of a prototype coating system being developed to protect molybdenum against high temperature oxidation (i.e. at 1600&#176;C for 500 hours) is a functionally graded layer based on MoSi2 + x SiC (where x is the variable mole fraction of SiC in the film). Different approaches for synthesizing composite films include sputtering from elemental or compound targets, reactive sputtering, and direct sputtering of composite targets. This paper will explore the feasibility of synthesizing composite films by RF magnetron sputtering of a composite target. Results of compositional depth profiling using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, microstructural evaluation and X-Ray diffraction analyses of the films will be presented. In particular, the diffusion of silicon and carbon in to the substrate will be characterized using a &quot;ball-cratering&quot; technique followed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique will help to overcome the disadvantages associated with ion-beam sputtering during depth profiling (e.g. different sputter yields for the constituent elements, interface broadening effects, etc.).

EFFECT OF COMBINED LOADING ON CRACK-TIP DEFORMATION IN GRAPHITE/EPOXY COMPOSITES:</B>  M.A. Seif, C.M. Hargrove, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088
<P>
An experimental investigation of the crack displacement and failure modes of graphite/epoxy plates [0/&#177;45/90]2s under tensile loading with central cracks at various angles (15&#176;, 30&#176;, 60&#176;, 75&#176;, and 90&#176;) was carried out. A mixed mode state of stresses developed at the center of the crack as a result of the crack orientation. Laser Speckle technique, a high sensitive noncontact technique, was employed to measure Crack Opening Displacement (COD) and Crack Shearing Displacement (CSD) of the crack emanating from the normal and tangential stresses at the crack center. Damage zones of the material at different crack orientation were examined and evaluated. The critical stress intensity factors for mode I and mode II were obtained from COD and CSD at failure. Detail studies were performed to investigate the behavior of the material during loading application and the effect of the angles on the stress distribution. The data obtained were compared with the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) solutions. The comparisons suggested a correlation within &#177;8 percent deviation. It was concluded from this investigation that the theoretical analysis could be applied to obtain the fracture properties of graphite/epoxy composites.

INCREASING THE OFF-AXIS AND MONOLITHIC STRENGTHS IN CONTINUOUS FIBER REINFORCED ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Colin McCullough</I>, Paul R. Nisson*, Steven R. Pittman Bill E. Birkholz, MMC Program, 3M Company, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000; *3M/MMC Production Plant, Middleway, WV 25430
<P>
Tremendous progress has been made in the properties of aluminum alloys reinforced with 60-70 vol. % of continuous alumina fibers, with tensile strengths routinely averaging 250 ksi (1.7 GPa) in the longitudinal direction. The choice of matrix and its resulting microstructure is critical in obtaining such strengths and the matrices used at 3M to date are a pure Al and an Al-2%Cu alloy. This leads to design considerations in composite performance (transverse and shear strengths) and in any unreinforced areas. To date, the pure Al and Al-2%Cu matrix composites have transverse strengths of 25 ksi (170 MPa) and 40 ksi (275 MPa) respectively. While these values have applications, higher strengths may be desirable. Also unreinforced areas could benefit greatly from higher yield strengths. Use of traditional higher strength alloys is seriously restricted due to both the reactivity with the fiber and their segregation behavior which dramatically reduces longitudinal strength. How ever a new aluminum alloy matrix composition promises to combine all the desired features of the matrix. Data will be presented showing retention of high longitudinal strengths while also achieving much higher transverse and monolithic strengths. The specifics of this system will be discussed as well as directions for optimization.

STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF ALUMINUM BASED PARTICULATE COMPOSITES SYNTHESIZED BY MECHANICAL ALLOYING:</B> J.M. Molnar, T.H. Courtney, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
Aluminum-based particulate composites have potential application in services requiring high strength combined with low density. We have used mechanical alloying followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) to fabricate a series of Al-Si-C particulate composites. Pure Al or Al-Si eutectic powder was mixed with graphite and SPEX milled for varying times. Consolidation of the mechanically alloyed powders was done by HIPing at 180MPa (26 ksi) which resulted in a fully dense composite. Aluminum carbide (Al4C3) is formed during consolidation. Formation of SiC is a possibility as well. Maximum hardnesses following HIPing correspond to an approximate yield strength of 990 MPa (144 ksi). Properties as they depend upon processing conditions and the resulting microstructure are discussed. This work was supported by the Army Research Office.

<P>
Thermomechanical processing to produce the HSRS for the SiC/6061 Al alloy composite fabricated by a vortex method before squeeze casting and extrusion was investigated. The SiC/6061 A1 composites hot-rolled in rolling strain per passes of 0.05~0.3 and at 573K indicate the m value of 0.4~0.6 and the total elongation of 200~300% in the strain rate of 0.08~1.3 s-1 and at 853K. The total elongations of the composite hot-rolled at 523 and 623K decrease to less than 150%. The flow stress of the composite heat treated by T6 after rolling increased and the total elongation decreased as compared with those of the composite without T6 due to reaction between SiC and matrix. The fracture surface of the composite has a partially liquid phase and filaments and it is thought that an interfacial sliding at the liquid phase contributes to the HSRS in addition to grain boundary sliding in the SiC/6061 Al composite fabricated by a vortex method.

COMPATIBILITY OF SEVERAL REINFORCEMENTS WITH Ti-Al AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPOSITES:</B> Chikura Fujiwara, Nagoya Aerospace Systems Works, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., 10, Oye-Cho, Minato-Ku, Nagoya, 455 Japan
<P>
Titanium aluminide matrix composites have received considerable attention due to their potential to have high specific strength and stiffness at high temperature. And SiC fibers are considered to be promising candidates for reinforcement of the composites. SiC/TiAl composites, however, are difficult to be fabricated in good state because of severe reactions at the interface being taken place during fabrication process. One of the most effective means to suppress the excessive reaction is to apply the diffusion barrier coating on the surface of SiC fiber. Another solution to fabricate a TiAl matrix composite is to apply the reinforcement which has good compatibility with matrix, TiAl. Several candidates for diffusion barrier coating between SiC fiber and TiAl were evaluated, then W and HfC showed excellent effects on suppress excessive interfacial reaction, while other candidates such as Al2O3, Zr, B2, Ce2O3 were not effective. Based on these results, a desirable interface model of organic polymer derived SiC reinforced TiAl composite is proposed. Other fibers were evaluated as reinforcements of TiAl matrix composites. Then it was found that W, W-Re, Re were good in compatibility with TiAl and consolidated with TiAl in good state. As a result, W-3%Re/TiAl showed 680 Mpa at 1373K.

Ceramic particulates reinforced composite is considered to be an effective way for improving the mechanical properties of Ti alloys and Ti-A1 intermetallics. In the present study, Ti-24Al-llNb(at%)/l0wt%TiB in-situ composites were prepared by the blended elemental powder metallurgy method. The tensile and high cycle fatigue properties of the composites were found to be much superior to those of the unreinforced matrix. Modification of the matrix microstructure was performed by annealing the composite at 1573K and air cooling, which resulted in a very fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> microstructure. The mechanical properties, particularly the fatigue property, were further improved by this microstructural modification technique.

<P>
A process which combines fiber coating and particles hybridizing together has been utilized for the structural optimization of carbon fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composite. SiC coating was derived by Sol-gel method and SiC particle hybridizing was processed in Sol-gel solution simultaneously. Squeeze-cast process was used to get bulk composite materials. SEM analysis of the material showed a well fiber distribution in Al matrix by particles hybridizing. Mechanical properties of the composite were improved especially for the axial strength. HRTEM research indicated the coating to be an effective barrier of the interface reaction. C/Al interfacial reaction was also studied meantime which revealed that pan-based carbon fiber reacted heavily with aluminum matrix. The nucleation and growth of the reactants were discussed.

CURRICULUM DESIGN; INPUTS AND OUTPUTS:</B> Richard Heckel, Dept. of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Michigan Technological Univ., 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931<P>
Undergraduate engineering curricula are designed by faculty committees in accord with accrediting guidelines for content, logical course sequencing and practical limitations for scheduling faculty and laboratory resources. Presently, engineering education is receiving intense scrutiny due to several decades of large tuition increases, continuous enrollment declines since the early '80s, constraints in external research support and decreases in the number of employment opportunities for graduates. These trends have already resulted in proposals for new curriculum designs which would, for example, reduce credits needed for graduation, sacrifice discipline-specific content and increase multidisciplinary activities. Presumably, such curricula would broaden appeal, increase engineering enrollments, widen the range of career opportunities and stimulate interest in industrial interactions. Can such curricula provide the optimum balance between the new educational boundary conditions and quality engineering education? To what extent should curriculum design emphasize graduate/employer feedback, student/parent expectations, instructional philosophy/methodology and general skill development (communication, self-directed learning, open-ended problem solving, ethical decision making, etc.)? Tradeoffs and opportunities associated with these issues will be discussed.

THE MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CORE CURRICULUM AT VIRGINIA TECH:</B> R.W. Hendricks, R.S. Gordon, Virginia Tech, MSE Dept., Blacksburg, VA 24061-0237<P>
We have developed a core curriculum for an ABET-approved Materials Science and Engineering curriculum incorporating 8 required core courses, options in each of the 5 principle fields (ceramics, composites, electronic materials, metallurgy and polymers), and developed an integrated &quot;across-the-curriculum&quot; approach to writing and communication, ethics, and statistics. Our required core courses, each with laboratory, include physical ceramics, physical metallurgy, electronic materials, and polymer engineering. These &quot;material specific&quot; courses are supported by three material-independent courses including X-ray diffraction, thermodynamics and transport processes, and by a capstone engineering design course based on a research project. Oral, written, and graphical communication, statistics, and ethics and integrated in a manner such that the student is led from fundamental concepts through to sophisticated interpretation of each topic. The student is exposed to these &quot;across-the-curriculum&quot; topics during each semester of the three year program of study beginning with the sophomore year.

MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING: THE NEW UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY:</B> <I>Alan Lawley</I>, Dept. of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104<P>
In 1994 the new undergraduate Drexel Engineering Curriculum was implemented, emphasizing 'up front' engineering, computer and communication skills, life long learning and teamwork. This common core in the first two years reflects many of the tenets and the philosophy of the E4 experiment ('Enhanced Educational Experience for Engineering Students') which began in 1988. Concurrently, the Department of Materials Engineering has been proactive in the Gateway Coalition, a major component of which is to build on E4 by focusing on the upper level curriculum via the development of advanced engineering science courses. Our new undergraduate major, enacted in 1995, reflects the maturing of the E4 experiment into the core Drexel Engineering Curriculum and the integration of selected engineering science courses (developed under the Gateway Coalition) into the curriculum at the upper level. Evolution of the new curriculum is discussed, including the development of modules in materials education.

MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CURRICULA; RETHINKING THE CORE CONTENT - THE CASE FOR A 128 HOUR CORE:</B> <I>Richard L. Porter</I>, Campus Box 7904, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7904<P>
Most materials educators agree that three major components constitute the undergraduate materials science and engineering curriculum; that presented in the first 2-3 semesters (generally the basic sciences), the real &quot;core,&quot; and finally the obligatory senior design or capstone experience. Scattered throughout will be the necessary humanities and social sciences, maybe a communications course or technical writing course. It is assummed that the mathematics, chemistry, physics, and writing have been properly and correctly introduced and students' have mastered the content. There are several problems with this approach; little if any experiential learning, little if any contextual learning for the basic sciences, little integration of engineering sciences with the basic sciences, and in many cases a disconnected core. Although all curricula meet and or exceed ABET criteria, there is little accountability for the actual content and methodology of presenting the material. This paper discusses the entire curricula in context with the intended outcome for materials science and engineering and encourages curricular designers to rethink the entire learning experience, not to simply add more courses for short term accomplishments. At North Carolina State University, our approach has been to introduce different models for first year engineering, ranging from a hands-on engineering experience linked with freshmen writing, an integrated approach pulling together math, chemistry, and physics, with a year year engineering overview, and recently a new freshmen course linked with the computer literacy course and including a weekly small-group problem solving session. Concurrently, we have administered an attitudes survey at the beginning of the year and again at the end of the semester and year. Students enrolled in these special courses report a greater interest in engineering as a problem solving discipline, they view engineering as an iterative process, and report a higher degree of satisfaction with their first year experiences. Finally, a curriculum will be presented and discussed that builds upon the fundamental basic sciences and integrates the curriculum rather than present it as a linear combination of sub-disciplines.

Competitive pressures have caused the automotive industry to critically examine and modify their engineering processes. The new engineering processes have put a higher value on certain skill sets than in the past. The need for technical competence has not changed - it is a given. The question for the Education Community is how to maintain a strong balanced technical framework while developing other critical skills. The goal should be to enhance the effectiveness of the student as he or she moves into and through their professional career. The authors will share their views around the critical question of &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;critical skills&quot;.

<P>
There is a broad recognition at IIT that we live in a time of revolutionary change in undergraduate education. In response, we are developing new ways to recruit and retain a diverse student body, seeking educational relationships with industry, experimenting with new approaches to teaching and learning, and positioning ourselves to meet ABET engineering criteria for the year 2000. The key elements of the undergraduate education restructuring will be presented. They include, but are not limited to, such initiatives as: Interprofessional Projects, project-oriented learning that teams students from different disciplines and professions and constitutes a new instructional tool though which students learn concepts of teamwork, communication and problem solving; Introduction to the Professions, a freshman-level course that in an innovative way bridges the gap between high school experience and the university's environment; Writing Across Curriculum, an institutional structure for integrating writing into engineering courses. Our attempts to increase computer competence, introduce multimedia in the classroom and create undergraduate research opportunities will also be discussed.

EFFECTIVE USE OF A SMALL FACULTY FOR MAINTENANCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE MATERIALS ENGINEERING PROGRAM:</B> <I>Jeffrey W. Fergus</I>, Materials Research and Education Center, 201 Ross Hall, Auburn University, AL 36849<P>
A recent analysis of the materials/metallurgical engineering programs at U.S. universities shows that these programs can be divided into three, approximately equal, groups in terms of faculty size. Specifically, there are 24 programs with 21-90 faculty, 23 programs with 13-20 faculty and 25 programs with 3-12 faculty. The small number of faculty in this latter group presents challenges in terms of maintaining a comprehensive (undergraduate, graduate, research) materials program. This presentation will relate experience with the materials engineering program at Auburn University, which has 7 full-time faculty, in meeting these challenges. In addition, the contribution of these small programs to the materials engineering discipline as a whole will be discussed.

THE <I>STRUCTURE</I> OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING; A NEW MODEL FOR MATERIALS ENGINEERING CURRICULA:</B> <I>Blair London</I>, Linda S. Vanasupa, Robert H. Heidersbach, Materials Engineering Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407
<P>
We have developed a new model for the materials engineering curriculum designed around a <I>structure</I> that must be carefully &quot;built&quot; during our program. The model clarifies the materials engineering curriculum, representing a new organizational structure that incorporates the broad concepts yet allows room for technological changes. We used four guiding principles: (1) the curriculum must impart certain core competencies to the students, (2) the courses are either four or five units (quarter system), many with a strong laboratory emphasis, (3) the sequence of courses is logical and can be clearly communicated, and (4) it must be accredited. The model can be summarized by the major physical features of the building. The <B>foundation</B> includes an introduction to materials engineering and a course on the structure of solids. The <B>pillars</B> represent the four basic parts of materials engineering (thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanical properties, electronic properties) that are common to, and &quot;hold up&quot;, all other aspects of the field. The <B>roof</B> consists of basic courses in metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites along with several technical electives. Finally, the building shows the <B>capstone</B> Senior Project as the culmination of their undergraduate education.

MATERIALS SCIENCE CURRICULUM: HOW WE SHOULD BE CHANGING IT:</B> <I>David Laughlin</I>, Dept. Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA 15213
<P>
The Materials Science curriculum in many Universities is a direct descendant of their Metallurgy or Metallurgical Engineering curriculum. As such, they often have in them &quot;relics&quot; of the past that seem to some to be outdated. One of the theses of this presentation is that some of the &quot;relics&quot; are indeed &quot;holy relics&quot; which if they are discarded by &quot;reforming zealots&quot; may lead to a crisis in the curriculum. A second thesis, is that indeed some of the elements of the curriculum must be changed in order to better prepare our students for the changing directions of the field. In this presentation the important elements which should remain are discussed as are some new themes that currently are not universally present in our curricula. Suggestions on how these &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; themes are to be integrated into the overall curricula will close out the presentation.

UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING AND MSE EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:</B> J.W. Jones, <I>R. Gibala</I>, Dept. of Materials Sci. and Engineering, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2136
<P>
The College of Engineering at the University of Michigan has begun an ambitious program to restructure its undergraduate curriculum. The new curriculum will increase freshman year participation in engineering and provide an active program for each student to learn communication skills throughout the curriculum, while increasing flexibility within all discipline-specific curricula. Furthermore the new approach calls for the restructuring of courses into 4 credit-hour units, thereby enabling students to complete their studies in 4 years by selecting 4 courses of 4 credit hours in each of 8 semesters for a total of 128 credit hours. The impact of this new curriculum template on Materials Science and Engineering education at Michigan will be described. Emphasis will be placed on proposed changes in laboratory and design courses to accommodate a strong and professionally administered engineering communications segment. The approaches used to provide breadth and depth in the MSE curriculum will also be described. Finally, the impact of these college-wide changes on MSE's role in providing an introductory materials education to non-MSE majors will be described.

The trends of microelectronic devices have advanced to the state that they operate in excess of 200 MHz with submicron feature size. Furthermore, these high performance IC requires Inputs/Outputs (I/O) signals that are in excess of a few 1000's. Low-cost, high performance flip-chip, area array solder joint interconnects are key to the success of this technology. In order to enhance the thermal cycle fatigue-life of these solder joints, underfill encapsulants are needed. In this talk, we will review the microelectronic packaging technology trends, the role of reliability, in particularly, the use of underfill encapsulants to enhance the thermal cycle fatigue life of solder joints will be discussed.

<P>SOLDER JOINTS IN ELECTRONICS--DESIGN FOR RELIABILITY:</B> <I>Werner Engelmaier</I>, President, Engelmaier Associates, Inc., 23 Gunther Street, Mendham, NJ 07945
<P>
The emerging new technologies provide ever more challenges to assure the reliability of electronic products. The ever increasing demands in electronic products for higher performance, lower cost, less space (weight) is leading to ever denser interconnection needs. Solder joint reliability is becoming an even more important issue with the advent of new surface mount packages and the use of surface mounted electronics in such hostile environments as the automobile and space. The new packages are characterized by larger sizes, finer pitches, and/or problematic materials which require an up-front 'Design for Reliability (DfR)' to meet reliability requirements. The hostile environments can include thermal excursions over temperature ranges in which multiple interactive damage mechanisms are operative. The reliability of electronic assemblies requires a definitive design effort that has to be carried out concurrently with the other design functions during the developmental phase of the product. There exists a misconception in the industry, that quality manufacturing is all that is required to assure the reliability of an electronic assembly. While of course, consistent high quality manufacturing - and all that this implies is a necessary prerequisite to assure the reliability of the product, only a DfR-procedure can assure that the design - manufactured to good quality - will be reliable in its intended application. Explicit DfR-procedures need to be employed to account and compensate, at least in part, for the prevalent damage mechanisms. This needs to be complemented with 'Design for Manufacturability (DfM)' which widens the process windows and takes into account the manufacturing capabilities. These demands put an increasing burden on the designers who will require a heightened technical understanding of the underlying issues and more sophisticated design tools. Thus, adherence to quality standards, such as IPC-A-620, <I>Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies with Surface Mount Technologies</I>, and ANSI/J-STD-001, <I>Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies</I> does not assure reliable solder connections, only quality solder connections. It is for this reason that IPC-D-279, <I>Design Guidelines for Reliable Surface Mount Technology Printed Board Assemblies</I>, is being developed. The 'Design for Reliability (DfR)' for solder attachments in electronic interconnections will be the emphasis of the paper.

<P>
Typical solder materials and solder joints, employed in fiber-optics engineering, are examined from the stand-point of the requirements for optical performance of the devices, as well as for the short- and long term mechanical reliability of the soldered optical fibers and the solder materials themselves. We address the geometry's of, and the loading condition in, fiber-optics solder joints, and suggest several analytical stress models that enable one to evaluate thermally and mechanically induced stresses in solder joint assemblies in fiber-optics structures. These models include: thermal stresses in metallized fibers soldered into ferrules or capillaries; stresses at the menisci areas in soldered joints; comparison of the thermal stresses due to the application of &quot;hard&quot; (high modulus) and &quot;soft&quot; (low modulus) solders; interaction of the &quot;global&quot; and &quot;local&quot; thermal stresses in optical fibers whose end portions are soldered into capillaries; evaluation and interaction of mechanical and thermal stresses in solder joints during proof-testing of optical fibers soldered into ferrules; and others. The merits and shortcomings of soldered assemblies in comparison with adhesively bonded structures are also briefly discussed.

<P>MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>Aleksander Zubelewicz</I>, IBM Microelectronics, W-64, Bldg. 4-2, 1701 North Street, Endicott, NY 13760 
<P>
The electronic industry is changing at a rapid pace. Faster and more powerful processors and ASICs continuously replace the slower devices, while price competitiveness and time-to-market becomes the true challenge for many manufacturers. The dynamic nature of the electronic industry drives for the need of using smaller packages with higher I/O count. Recently, fine pitch, a family of BGA components, and Chip Scale Packages represent the &quot;hottest&quot; technologies allowing for high I/O density. However, the future electronics applications will require processors operating with speed of several hundred MHz, then the present packaging technology may need further modifications. Consequently, the traditional PTH interconnection technology is being replaced by Surface Mount Technology and Ball Grid Arrays. Furthermore, new interconnection materials such as lead free solders and conductive adhesives are being seriously considered as a replacement of the commonly used lead based alloys. The objective of the paper is to discuss the behavior and failure mechanisms for the interconnection materials. Obviously, solders are at the top of the list, followed by encapsulations and conductive adhesives. During manufacturing operations, solders are used in the form of a paste, and when reflowed becomes ductile polycrystalline materials. These pastes must maintain appropriate rheological characteristics. It will be shown that a typical paste (solder or conductive adhesive) exhibits three stages of behavior: paste as a viscous solid, paste as a viscous fluid, and the transition stage between solid and fluid. Solder joints (after reflow) are thought to carry input/output electrical functions of the assembly as well as are designed to provide a mechanical support for the package or chip. Solders exhibit very complex microstructural behavior. There is a need for material model of solders, a model that can be used in the form of constitutive equations with built-in damage criteria, equipped with functions that represent microstructural evolution of solders, and allowing to predict the effect of strain/damage localization in solder joints. Moreover, this theory should lead to simple fatigue equations when needed. One such theory exists and will be discussed in the paper. In many cases, solder joints become the weakest link. Enhancement of the joint reliability can be accomplished by encapsulating them with polymer based materials. A microstructural numerical study for encapsulant will be briefly presented in the paper. It will be shown that fracture originates at the microscopic level of the materials, coalesce, and forms a localized fracture zone.

<P>INCONSISTENCIES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY PHYSICS:</B> <I>Liang-chi Wen</I>, G. Mon, R. Ross, Jr., Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109
<P>
An inherent reliability problem associated with surface mount applications is that solder joints, which serve both as an electrical and a mechanical connection between part and board, are subject to thermal fatigue failure. Solder joint failure involves a complex interplay of creep and fatigue processes. Over the years, many analytical and experimental research studies have aimed to improve state-of-the-art assessment of solder joint integrity from a physics of failure perspective. Although considerable progress has been made, there still exist many inconsistent and even contradictory correlations and conclusions. This paper reviews the unique properties of near-eutectic tin-lead solder, properties such as age-softening and 'superplastic' behavior under low strain rate loading. Fundamental mechanical and thermomechanical processes are modeled to demonstrate many inconsistencies observed in the literature. These inconsistencies are to be found in both analysis and testing issues. Analytical inconsistencies arise in correlations involving Coffin-Manson and strain energy density algorithms for cycle-life prediction, the effects of mean temperature and cycle frequency, and the determination of test acceleration factors. Testing inconsistencies are to be found in the areas of mechanical versus thermal cycling, failure definations, detection methodology and treatment of failure statistics. The objective of this paper is to identify important unsettled analysis and testing issues whose resolution by the solder joint research community will assure a greater degree of solder joint reliability.

<P>AUTOMATED SOLDER LIFE ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC MODULES:</B> <I>Stephen A. McKeown</I>, Lockheed Martin Control Systems, 600 Main Street, Johnson City, NY 13790
<P>
The solder life analysis methods developed by Engelmaier and Steinberg have been incorporated into an automated method which combines the results of finite-element models, a component location file obtained from a computer-aided design tool, component data, and environment data to calculate the expected solder joint life for each surface mount technology component on an electronic module. The method uses the finite-element method to calculate the coefficient of thermal expansion at different locations on the surface of the module which is used in determining the thermal cycling life of the solder joints. Finite-element analysis is also used to determine the surface strains due to vibration of the module which also influences solder joint life. The component location is taken from a Mentor&#174; neutral file which also provides component description and orientation. Component data includes the dimensions of the part and information on the solder joint fillet geometry. Environment data includes temperature ranges, dwell times, vibration levels, and durations of thermal/vibration missions. This information is combined in a ANSI C-language program to determine the calculated failure rate of each component for the combined environments, and the overall computed reliability of all of the analyzed solder joints.

<P>WHEN IS A MODIFIED COFFIN-MANSON APPROACH VALID FOR SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY PREDICTION?:</B> <I>Robert Darveaux</I>, Amkor Electronics, 1900 S. Price Road, Chandler, AZ 85248
<P>
The Coffin-Manson approach is based on relating fatigue life to plastic strain range. The basic equation has been modified by Norris-Landzberg, Engelmaier, and others to include temperature, frequency or dwell time effects. These modifications were determined empirically on specific types of soldered assemblies. Today, they are commonly applied to a wide range of assemblies and test conditions, as well as field use conditions. The main advantage of these empirical relations is that they are easy to use. They are basically back of the envelope calculations that require almost no expertise on the part of the engineer. This paper explores the validity of modified Coffin-Manson approaches as applied to solder joint reliability analysis. Several case studies are examined, and the limits of the approach are defined.

<P>THE INFLUENCE OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON THE FAILURE OF EUTECTIC SOLDERS:</B> <I>John W. Morris, Jr., </I>H. Reynolds, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, and Center for Advanced Materials, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, CA 94720
<P>
<P>There are three key mechanisms of failure during the life of microelectronic solder joints: overload failure during handling, thermal fatigue failure during service, and, particularly in the case of joints for optoelectronic devices, dimensional changes during service. Each of these failure modes is strongly influenced by microstructure of the solder, which is, in turn, affected by the composition of the solder, the chemical nature of the substrate, and the manufacturing process that is used to create the joint. The present talk will discuss the varieties of microstructure that are found in common solder joints, their influence on lifetime and failure mode, and the metallurgical techniques that can be used to control microstructure and modify the nature and kinetics of joint failure.

<P>DIFFUSION PROCESSES IN LEAD BASED SOLDERS USED IN MICROELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS--AN OVERVIEW:</B> <I>Devendra Gupta1</I>, J. M. Oberschmidt2, K. Vieregge3, 1IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, P.O.

<P>
<P>Lead based solders are main stay of the microelectronic industry. Besides their use in printed boards, they are employed in interconnections of Si chip-to-substrates such as the multi-chip-modules, the thermal-conduction-module, the tape-automated bonding etc. During their service, the solder interconnections, commonly known as C-4 joints, are subjected to temperatures of the order of 100&#176;C which translate to homologous temperatures of T/Tm 0.5 where Tm is the melting temperature in Kelvin. At these temperatures, a host of diffusion and related phenomena become operative notably the diffusion in the lattice and grain boundaries, creep and fatigue which eventually determine reliability of the device packaging. We have carried out extensive diffusion studies on the Pb-In and Pb-Sn solders over a range of composition using radioactive tracer techniques. We will discuss therein the various diffusion process, their modifications through ternary solute additions such Au and Cu and the role of unstable microstructure particularly in the eutectic solders.

<P>
Over the last several years, we have experimented with lead-tin eutectic carefully controlled microstructure in order to learn about creep, microstructural evolution, and fatigue cracking in this alloy. The purpose of those experiments has been to formulate a mechanistic basis for modeling the creep-fatigue interaction. In this paper we review the work. Creep tests, tensile tests, and load relaxation tests combined with microstructural characterization and theoretical modeling have helped to provide insight into the roles of dislocations and colony boundary sliding during creep. Colony boundary sliding impacts upon cracking and coarsening during fatigue. Work hardening and dynamic recovery during creep affect subsequent coarsening. Fatigue experiments examining the effects of frequency and strain range on fatigue crack growth have revealed transitions in mode of crack growth accompanying the onset of colony boundary sliding at low strain rates. Experimental studies of the effect of prior deformation on subsequent coarsening reveal that the factor by which coarsening accelerates depends on the rate of deformation. *Supported by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

A NEW METHODOLOGY TO MEASURE DAMAGING STRAINS IN LEAD/TIN SOLDERS:</B> <I>Abbas I. Attarwala1</I> and Juan M. Sanchez2, 1Hewlett-Packard Company, IC Business Development Division, Palo Alto, CA 94304; 2Center for Materials Science, The University of Texas at Austin, TX 78712
<P>
A new methodology was developed to isolate and measure the damaging strains in lead/tin solders. The new methodology is based on load controlling cycling as opposed to strain controlled cycling. Under load controlled cycling conditions it is easy to separate out the effects of the different strain components. It was determined that the damaging strains were primarily creep strains, even at a cyclic rate of 0.5 Hz at a temperature of -40&#176;C. Fractographic analysis of the fractured specimens confirmed that failure even at -40&#176;C occurs by creep processes. The envelope strain curve generated from load controlled cycling data is a direct measure of the damaging strains stored in the material. A new parameter, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">D was identified. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">D is the damaging strain stored per cycle. The damaging strains per cycle measured for various solder compositions tested at varying frequencies, temperatures and microstructures could all be correlated by simple linear relationships. It was observed that the damaging strain stored during the secondary creep region of the envelope strain curve ranges from 2% strain to 18% strain depending on the test conditions.

<P>
Experiments on deformation and rupture of eutectic Sn/Pb solder will be discussed. These involve <I>in-situ</I> field emission SEM observations made during tensile and thin-walled torsional shear testing at room and elevated temperatures. Deformation concentrates on colony boundaries, leading to cavitation, cracking, and tertiary creep. Cavity formation also induces a large anelastic (time-dependent recoverable strain) effect. Progressive colony boundary damage has been mapped from sequential <I>in-situ</I> images. Subsequent strain field mapping and animations, highlight and quantify the relative deformations. High magnification image sequences characterize cavity growth and coalescence mechanisms. Upon combining with calculations of stress distribution, creep induced cavitation and crack propagation have been quantified.

The mechanical properties (E, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">0.2, UTS and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">%) of five Pb-Sn solder alloys (63Sn/37Pb, 62Sn/36Pb/2Ag, 96Sn/4Ag, 95Pb/5Sn, 90Pb/10Sn) commonly used in electronic packaging have been determined over the temperature range of -200&#176;C to 150&#176;C using uniaxial tensile test, dynamic mechanical analysis, and acoustic pulse method. The following results have been found: (1) the elastic moduli decreases linearly with increasing temperature until 70&#176;C, then rapidly drop for the temperature 100&#176;C and above; the strength (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">0.2, UTS) decreases with increasing temperature with the exception that for the solid solution solder (95Pb/5Sn, 90Sn/10Sn) which remain approximately constant; (3) the ductility change is complex: for lead matrix solid solution solders; the total elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>r</I>) increasing slowly with increasing temperature, the uniform elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>u</I>) is relatively high (&gt;20%), and decreases slowly with increasing temperature, and the neck elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>n</I>) increases sharply with increasing temperature; whereas, for the eutectic solders (63Sn/37Pb, 62Pb/36Ag/2Ag, 96Sn/4Ag), the super-plasticity occurs at high temperature (&gt;100&#176;C), while at low temperature (-150&#176;C) the brittle fracture occurs, the higher uniform elongation occurs at about -100&#176;C.

When a liquid alloy spreads on a substrate, interdiffusion may result in melting of the substrate of the substrate and/or formation of intermetallic phases. We investigate the former case and describe the evolution of the non-planar interface on the lower surface of the drop. An approximate diffusion analysis is performed for a drop whose height is much smaller than its width. The coupling between the melting process and the rate of advance of the triple junction is explored for a variety of contact angle conditions. Numerical solution of the governing equation are performed and compared to experimental results for Bi-Sn alloys spreading of a droplet on a grain boundary.

EFFECT OF COMPOSITE STRENGTHENING STRATEGIES ON THE MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION IN A TIN-SILVER SOLDER: </B> <I>A.W. Gibson</I>, S.L. Choi, J.L. McDougall, T.R. Bieler, K.N. Subramanian, Department of Materials Science and Mechanics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824
<P>
Pending Federal regulations provide the impetus for using Pb-free solders. Automotive electronics and solders are exposed to thermal cycles in the range of -40&#176;C to 150&#176;C under cyclic and quasi-static conditions, and they experience low and high frequency mechanical fatigue vibrations. Since coarsening of microstructural features is known to affect fatigue resistance, the effects of aging behavior is investigated using eutectic Sn-Ag solder as a model system, with and without intentionally added intermetallic strengthening phases. Small single shear lap specimens with a size similar to joints in microelectronic applications are used to obtain microstructures that are obtained in real solder joints. Eutectic Sn-Ag solder joint microstructures coarsen when aged between 40 and 150&#176;C for as little as a week. The microstructural evolution and its effect on mechanical properties is monitored with ageing temperature and time, and the kinetics of ageing is determined. The effects of adding composite intermetallic phases on the solder interface and ageing behavior are compared to the model Sn-Ag system.

FORCED DIFFUSION THERMOGRAPHY FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION OF MICROSTRUCTURES:</B> David A. Jahnke, <I>Bela I. Sandor</I>, Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics Dept., University of Wisconsin, 153 Engineering Research Building, Madison, WI 53704
<P>
Forced Diffusion Thermography (FDT), differential temperature detection across a material flaw while providing a controlled AC heat flux input, has been developed recently for structural integrity assessment in large structures. This paper presents FDT to identify microscopic flaws by both finite element analysis and experimentation. The technical difficulties are the production of a microscopic width heat flux line pattern and the spatial and temperature resolution of the infrared camera. A finite element model one millimeter square and one-third millimeter deep of tin solder material with various surface crack sizes specimens with known microscopic flaws were performed using an infrared camera with a temperature resolution of one mK. A seven mW helium-neon laser provided an AC heat input area of 250 micron wide by five millimeters long to the specimen's surface. The results show that this method can be applied to detect flaws in small specimens of solder and similar materials.

DESIGNING WITH Pb-FREE SOLDERS:</B> <I>Walter L. Winterbottom</I>, Reliability Consultant, 30106 Pipers Lane Court, Farmington Hill, MI 48331<P>
As the global competition in the transportation industry intensifies, the focus on quality and time-to-market have become major driving forces in product design and dominant forces in the market place. Although the current design/development process as practiced in the industry provides a time tested path for new products, leadership in these areas seems to be elusive. A York Times article (March, 1991) notes that <I>Consumers Report</I> ranks the reliability of new American models at about the level of the average Japanese models. In 1988, the Material Systems Reliability Department was organized in the Materials Research Laboratory of Ford Research with the mission to evaluate existing, and develop if necessary, design methodologies capable of the task of providing world leadership in both quality and time-to-market. It was apparent from the outset that a life-cycle design approach must be used to contain reliability, cost, and environmental considerations in a time efficient manner. Further, it became increasingly apparent from the Department's failure mode/root cause identification and testing assistance activities that these issues have to be designed into a product rather than being assured by extensive prototype testing programs. A Design-for-Reliability methodology based upon the development of analytical prototypes which has the capability to fulfill the requirements for world leadership. The methodology is based upon the definition of system failure modes and mechanisms, system model development with verification capable of reliability prediction early in the design process prior to the building and testing of prototype hardware. This 'preventive' approach is based upon quantitative reliability estimates as a key design metric for use in assessing design alternatives. In simplest terms, the approach emphasizes the need to consider products as material systems whose reliability must be thoroughly understood early in the design and development process. The traditional 'build, test, and fix' design approach must be replaced with an approach that relies upon analytical prototypes leading to a single, optimized, prototype hardware build. In the presentation, the Design-for-Reliability approach will be illustrated using electronic packaging design with lead-free solder interconnects as example.

DESIGN OF NEW SOLDER ALLOYS THROUGH MICROSTRUCTURE CONTROL: </B> <I>Sungho Jin</I>, Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Room 1A-123, 700 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ 07974<P>
The mechanical properties of solder alloys and reliability of solder joints are significantly affected by microstructural features such as grain size, phase distribution, and precipitate morphology. A finer grain size, smaller precipi
 tates, and a uniformity in phase, precipitate and grain size distribution are often beneficial for improving the strength and ductility as well as the resistance in fatigue and creep failures. The control of microstructure is accomplished by modifications in alloy chemistry and processing conditions. Several examples of microstructural control in lead-free solder systems will be discussed. More forward-looking approaches for further control of microstructure in solder alloys and composites, e.g., by distribution of nano-scale dispersoid particles will also be discussed.

LEAD-FREE SOLDERS FOR ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY:</B> Fay Hua, <I>Judy Glazer</I>, Hewlett-Packard Co., Electronic Assembly Development Center, Mail Stop 4U-3, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304<P>
This paper gives an up dated literature review on the metallurgy of lead-free solders for electronic assembly. The review includes newly reported technical data on existing binary Sn-based eutectic alloys: Sn-Ag, Sn-Bi, Sn-Cu and Sn-In. It also reviews the newly developed multi-component solder alloys in following systems: Sn-Zn-In, Sn-Zn-Bi, Sn-Zn-Sb, Sn-Ag-Zn, Sn-Ag-Cu(-Sb), Sn-Ag-Bi, Sn-Ag-In(-Sb), Sn-Bi-In, and Sn-Bi-Sb. The characteristics of these alloys described are chemical composition, physical properties, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The manufacturability issues and applications of these lead-free solders in electronic assembly will be presented.

SUMMARY OF RECENT STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON MICROSTRUCTURE OF SOME SOLDER ALLOYS:</B> <I>James Clum</I>, E. Cotts, N. Jiang, Mechanical Engineering, Physics Department, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902<P>
A variety of solder alloys selected from the Sn-based, and In-based systems, have been examined to test for the interaction of composition with processing conditions in controlling alloy microstructure. Rate of solidification, amount of compressive strain, annealing temperature and time were the independent variable studied. Grain size, phase fraction and microhardness have been monitored as measures of microstructural changes. A simple factorially designed experimental plan has been used to conduct and interpret the tests. A major effect of solidification rate and a secondary effect of the interaction between deformation and annealing was observed for most alloys. The effect of alloy composition is reflected primarily in terms of the role of Tambient/Tm on microstructural stability. Some other processing related characteristics of these solder alloys will also be discussed such as creep and stress relaxation behavior. The role of microstructure in behaviors such as grain boundary sliding will be illustrated.

EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES TO LEAD SOLDERS FOR PRINTED WIRING APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>James F. Maguire</I>, Boeing Co., P. O. Box 3999, Defense &amp; Space Systems Group, Mail Stop 3W-97, Seattle, WA 98124<P>
This paper describes the first phase of a three year program undertaken by Boeing to evaluate &quot;no lead&quot; materials as a potential replacement for solder in printed wiring assembly applications. This program is looking at a number of different potential replacements including both conductive adhesives and &quot;no lead&quot; solder materials. In addition, the impact of other environmentally driven process changes such as &quot;no clean&quot; soldering and lead free PWB finishes are being tested for compatibility with &quot;no lead&quot; attachment materials. The phases of this program are: Phase I: Initial materials evaluations, processability, stability of electrical performance in environmental exposure, sequential exposure to temperature/humidity cycling and thermal shock environments, compatibility with &quot;standard&quot; finishes (reflowed solder and &quot;de-oxidized&quot; copper), down Selection for Phase II testing; Phase II: detailed material performance testing, stability of contact and bulk resistance during environmental exposure, compatibility with high speed/RF applications, * Compatibility with existing PWA processes such as - pre-conformal coat cleaning, rework/repair, down selection for Phase III testing; Phase III: Development of design allowables and manufacturing processes. This paper will discuss the results of Phase I of this program which evaluated a total of 21 conductive adhesives and 8 commercially available solder alloys with control samples fabricated with Sn63 solder.

CREEP AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Sn-5%Sb SOLDER: </B> <I>Rao K. Mahidhara</I>, K. Linga Murty and Fahmy M. Haggag, Tessera Inc., 3099 Orchard Drive, San Jose, CA 95134; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695; Advanced Technology Corporation, Oak Ridge, TN 37830<P>

A knowledge of the mechanical and creep properties of solder materials is required both for alloy development and life-prediction. We report here tensile and creep properties of Sn-5%Sb which is one of the candidate materials for replacing lead-based solders in electronic packaging. The temperature and stress dependencies of the strain-rate are evaluated using both the tensile and creep tests. In addition, the recently developed Stress-Strain Microprobe (SSM) is used to evaluate the strain-rate dependence of stress through automated ball indentation (ABI) tests at ambient. An excellent correlation is noted between creep and ABI data. While creep tests covered low stresses, ABI corresponded to high stresses which revealed breakdown of the Norton-law noted at lower stresses. While creep tests took 5 months time, the ABI tests were completed in a matter of hours although they covered 3 orders of magnitude strain-rates. The utility of ABI technique in solder joints is clearly pointed out and such tests are planned on <I>real</I> joints. ABI tests at elevated temperatures were not performed to-date. Such a facility is now under development and future plans include testing at elevated temperatures on bulk as well as solder joints.

CHARACTERIZATION OF 58Bi-42Sn SOLDERED ON Sn-Pb COATED SURFACE:</B> <I>Zequn Mei</I>, Fay Hua, Judy Glazer, Hewlett-Packard Co., Electronic Assembly Development Center, Mail Stop 4U-3, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304<P>
As reported in our previous work, solder joints of 58Bi-Sn on 80Sn-20Pb coated surface failed prematurely in thermal cycles between -40&#176;C to 100&#176;C. The failure mechanism was identified to be the dissolving of Pb atoms into the 58Bi-Sn solder joint during soldering, which caused formation of the ternary eutectic 52Bi-30Pb-18Sn with melting point of 95&#176;C. In this paper, study of three types of solder joints will be reported: (1) 58Bi-42Sn soldered on Cu surface, (2) 58Bi-42Sn solder on 80Sn-20Pb coated surface, and (3) 57.5Bi-41.5Sn-1Pb soldered on Cu surface. These solder joints were aged at 80&#176;C and 110&#176;C. The evolution of the grain or phase sizes and the degradation of mechanical properties will be characterized as function of aging time. Early results indicate that the grains grew much faster in the solder joints containing Pb atoms (types 2 and 3 above), which reduced mechanical strength and ductility, than the solder joints without Pb atoms (type 1). Detailed results will be reported in the meeting.

MICROSTRUCTURAL STABILITY AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN-SILVER-COPPER SOLDER JOINTS:</B> <I>Iver E. Anderson, </I>Ozer Unal, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, 122 Metals Development Bldg., Ames, IA 50011<P>
The properties of a Pb-free ternary eutectic solder alloy, Sn-4.7Ag-1.7Cu (wt.%), which was discovered in our laboratory have been evaluated. This patented alloy has a melting point of 217&#176;C, a fine 3-phase eutectic microstructure, and a very good solderability. The primary goal of this investigation has been to enhance its microstructural stability for high temperature environments, greater than 125&#176;C, and to improve its overall mechanical properties, especially for extended service. Thus, minor modifications were made in the base eutectic alloy to control microstructural aging without degrading solderability. Alloying effects on solder/Cu joints in the as-soldered and aged conditions were studied. Tensile strength and shear strength measurements were made using butt and lap shear joint configurations, respectively, under various loading conditions. The results will be presented and their implications will be discussed. Support from the DOE-BES-DMS under Contract No. W-7405-Eng-82 is gratefully acknowledged.

THERMAL AGING AND IN-BOARD PEEL TESTING OF PB-FREE SOLDERS FOR UNDERHOOD APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Martin W. Weiser</I>, Julie A. Kern, Celeste A. Drewien, Frederick G.

Euclid Avenue, Spokane, WA 99216; University of New Mexico, Mechanical Engineering Department, Albuquerque, NM 87131; Sandia National Laboratories, Materials and Process Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87185<P>
The thermal aging and post aging joint strength of four Pb-free solder alloys on a Ag-Pt thick film metalization were studied as the last part of a larger evaluation of solder/flux/metalization systems for use in high temperature under hood automotive application. The solders were the Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu eutectics and a Bi modified version of each. Solder pastes were reflowed on metalized alumina in a commercial inert atmosphere belt furnace. Aging of both sessile drops and in-board peel test samples was conducted at 134 to 190&#176;C for up to 1000 hours. Addition of Bi and/or Cu increased the intermetallic growth rate and decreased the in-board peel strength.

RATE-CONTROLLING MECHANISM DURING PLASTIC DEFORMATION OF 95.5Sn4Cu0.5Ag SOLDER JOINTS AT HIGH HOMOLOGOUS TEMPERATURES:</B> <I>Hans Conrad</I>, Z. Guo and Y. H. Pao, Materials Science and Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695; Ford Scientific Research Laboratory, Materials Systems and Reliability Department, 20000 Rotunda Drive, Dearborn, MI 48121
<P>
The effects of stress and temperature on the creep rate of 95.5Sn4Cu0.5Ag solder joints at 22&#176;C to 168&#176;C were investigated employing stress-change and temperature-change tests. The resulting plastic deformation kinetics are in accord with those obtained previously in constant strain rate tests. They are better described by an obstacle-controlled dislocation glide kinetics equation than the usual Dorn equation for diffusion-controlled mechanism. The Helmholtz free energy for overcoming the obstacles is 0.28&#181;b3, where &#181; is the shear modulus and <I>b</I> the Burgers vector. The activation volume is of the order of 1000 b3. The plastic deformation kinetics are in reasonable accord with the intersection of dislocations as the rate-controlling mechanism. However, alternative mechanisms are not ruled out.

ALLOY DESIGN OF Sn-Zn-X (X=In, Bi) SOLDER SYSTEM THROUGH PHASE EQUILIBRIA CALCULATIONS:</B> <I>Sueng Wook Yoon</I>, Jeong Ryong Soh, Byeong-Joo Lee, Hyuck Mo Lee, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Kusung-Dong 373-1, Yusung-Gu, Taejon, Korea 305-701; Materials Evaluation Center, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, P.O. Box 3, Taedok Science Town, Taejon, Korea 305-606
<P>
Thermodynamic studies of the Sn-Zn-X (X=In, Bi) system have been carried out in terms of phase equilibria to design Pb-free solder alloys which are drop-in replacement for Sn-37Pb alloy. Based on the result of phase equilibria calculations, several selected alloys were chosen and analyzed by DSC, XRD and EPMA techniques. Microstructures of as-cast and heat-treated alloys were examined as well as the interface between solder joint and Cu substrate by optical microscopy and SEM. Spreading area test and preliminary mechanical test were performed to investigate the possibility as an alternative of eutectic Pb-Sn-solder.

THE NIST SOLDER INTERCONNECT DESIGN TEAM PROGRAM:</B> James A. Warren, <I>Carol A. Handwerker</I>, Metallurgy Division, Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899
<P>
The NIST Solder Interconnect Design Team has been found to address several pressing issues in the design and fabrication of circuit board. Having met frequently over the past three years, in partnership with academic and industrial researchers, the Team has established an agenda for solving solder joint shape, and the consequential thermal/mechanical properties of the formed joint. Our ultimate goal is to provide the industrial community with a suite of useful software tools for solder interconnect design, and to provide solved test problems (available electronically on the World Wide Web), that can be modified to suit the needs of the particular user. With this in mind we are actively supporting the development of software which will interface the public domain program Surface Evolver, which has been shown to be quite capable at computing equilibrium meniscus shapes. A discussion of the outstanding problems, as well as the software tools under development will be presented.

MODELING NON-ISOTHERMAL INTERMETALLIC LAYER GROWTH IN THE 63Sn-37Pb SYSTEM:</B> <I>Paul T. Vianco</I>, P.L. Hopkins, K.L. Erickson, D.R. Frear, R. Davidson, Department 1831, Mail Stop 0340, P.O. Box 5800, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185

The reliability of mechanical and electronic systems can be acutely dependent on the integrity of the soldered joints used in their assembly. During product manufacture, intermetallic layers from in reaction zones between the dissimilar materials of solder joints. Thermal cycling during service can cause further growth of the intermetallic layer, which may jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the joint as well as its capacity for rework or repair later on. Models describing service-related changes to solder joint microstructure are essential to understanding and predicting the long-term mechanical reliability and serviceability of these interconnects. In previously published work (J. Electronic Materials, v. 23, No. 8, 1994, pp. 721-729) a model describing the diffusion-controlled growth of multiple intermetallic layers and the displacement of the interfaces between layers was developed and implemented in a one-dimensional computer code based on the method-of-lines. The model can accommodate cases involving: (1) finite initial layer thickness, (2) rate-limiting interfacial reactions, (3) multiple and variable diffusion coefficients, and (4) finite material boundaries. Additionally, the effects of nucleation can be modeled empirically. A transformation of spatial coordinate circumvented the need to remesh the growing and (or) shrinking layers. Results from the one-dimensional code were verified by comparing the numerical output with analytical solutions for simple systems involving two, three, and five layers. The computer code was then applied for analysis of intermetallic layer growth from solder aging experiments performed with 100Sn and 63Sn-37Pb solders. The analysis indicated that intermetallic layer growth was consistent with bulk diffusion mechanism involving Cu and (or) Sn and variable diffusion coefficients that reflect some enhanced diffusion during early growth. In this work, non-isothermal solder-aging experiments were done with the 63Sn-37Pb/Cu system using two temperature histories: a low frequency history consisting of 4 cycles per day between -50 and 170&#176;C, and a high frequency history consisting of 72 cycles per day and the same limits. Thicknesses of both the Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 intermetallic layers were determined as a function of time for both temperature histories. An enhanced version of the previously developed model was used to predict the non-isothermal intermetallic layer growth for both temperature histories. Arrhenius expressions for diffusion coefficients in both the Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 layers were determined using experimental data from previous isothermal studies. This paper describes the non-isothermal experiments and a comparison of calculated and observed layer growth as a function of time.

The fatigue-induced solder joint failure of surface mounted electronic devices has become one of the most critical reliability issues in electronic packaging industry. Solder joint reliability performance has been found to be highly dependent on the solder joint configuration, which, in turn, is governed by bond pad size, component weight, alloy material, and leadframe structure, as well as solder reflow characteristics. The objective of this work is to develop numerical models: 1) to simulate the solder joint formation during the reflow process; 2) to determine the stress/strain distribution within the joint; and 3) further predict the reliability (fatigue life) of the solder joints. The solder joint formation process during solidification stage can be simulated using the Surface Evolver software tool developed by University of Minnesota. The thermomechanical stress-strain analysis can then be carried out using ANSYS to study selected critical design/manufacturing parameters such as leadframe geometry, pad size and dimensions, solder paste volume, leadframe placement misalignment, etc. This effort also involves the development of interface linking Surface Evolver and ANSYS.

The most commonly used solder for electrical interconnects in electronic packages is the near eutectic 60Sn-40Pb alloy. This alloy has a number of processing advantages (suitable melting point of 183&#176;C and good wetting behavior). However, under conditions of cyclic strain and temperature (thermomechanical fatigue) the microstructure of this alloy undergoes a heterogeneous coarsening and failure process that makes prediction of solder joint lifetime complex. A visco-plastic, microstructural dependent, constitutive model for solder has been developed and implemented into a finite element code. With this computational capability, the thermomechanical response of solder interconnects, including microstructural evolution, can be predicted. This capability was applied to predict the thermomechanical response of various solder interconnects to determine the effects of variations in geometry and loading. In this paper, the constitutive model will be briefly discussed and response predicted by the constitutive model will be compared to material test results. Finally, the results of computational studies to determine the effect of geometry and loading variations will be presented. This work was performed at Sandia National Laboratories, and supported by the U. S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL8500.

AN ELASTOPLASTIC BEAM MODEL FOR COLUMN-GRID-ARRAY (CGA) SOLDER INTERCONNECTS:</B> <I>Steven M. Heinrich</I>*, J.A. Swanson*, and P.S. Lee**; *Rockwell Automation, Allen-Bradley Co., Milwaukee, WI 53233; **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI 53233

A semi-analytical model is developed and implemented to analyze the deformation of solder columns in column-grid-array (CGA) assemblies. Each solder column is modeled as a prismatic beam of circular cross-section, subjected to end shearing deflections caused by thermal mismatch between the module and the circuit board. The solder is idealized as an elastic-perfectly plastic material whose yielding is governed by the Von Mises criterion. Since the columns are relatively short, transverse shear deformation has been incorporated into the beam model. The results generated with the model indicate the following: (a) yielding is governed by <I>bending</I> for slenderness ratios (height-to-diameter) of h/d<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">1/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot.gif">3; (b) the nonlinear stiffness relationship for a sheared column, presented in dimensionless form, reduces to a <I>single</I> curve which is valid for <I>arbitrary</I> values of slenderness ratio (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">1/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot.gif">3) and material parameters; (c) the dimensionless relationship between maximum shear strain (in the Tresca sense) and the relative end deflection depends on Poisson's ratio but is independent of the other material parameters and the slenderness ratio. The nonlinear stiffness results presented in the paper may be used to create more efficient finite element models of entire assemblies by replacing each column with a single nonlinear spring element. When used in conjunction with an appropriate Coffin-Manson relationship, the maximum shear strain curves presented herein may be utilized to estimate column fatigue life.

EFFECT OF ASSEMBLY STIFFNESS AND TEMPERATURE CYCLE PARAMETERS ON THERMOMECHANICAL RESPONSE OF SOLDER JOINTS:</B><I> Ahmer Syed</I>, Delco Electronics Corporation, M/S T100-26, 700 East Firman Drive, Kokomo, IN 46904
<P>
Grain boundary sliding and matrix creep are recognized as the main contributors to creep behavior of eutectic Sn/Pb solder joints in thermomechanical loading. The relative contribution and dominance of these mechanisms in the total response is governed by the external (temperature, assembly stiffness, CTE mismatch) as well as the internal shape (shape, size and thickness of the solder joint) factors. This paper examines the effect of external factors on the grain boundary and matrix creep response of solder joints. Experimental as well as numerical techniques are employed to compare which mechanism dominates under several different assembly stiffness and temperature profile conditions. A fatigue life prediction model which accounts for different mechanisms is used to determine the impact of grain boundary sliding and matrix creep on solder joint fatigue life.

BEHAVIOR OF SOLDER JOINTS UNDER COMPLEX DISPLACEMENT LOADING</B>: <I>Matthew G. Bevan</I>, Manfred Wutting, The John Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, John Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723
<P>
In many applications, solder is exposed to a complex fatigue spectrum composed of thermal effects, shock and vibration. In the laboratory; however, solder is usually tested using simple wave forms generated by mechanical testers or by thermal cycling. In order to apply laboratory results to predict the real world fatigue, several crucial steps are necessary. One of these steps is understanding how to combine the effects of simple displacement (or stress) waves to predict the effects of complex waves. One method of combining waves is to use a linear damage accumulation model employing rainflow analysis. Briefly, rainflow analysis establishes an envelope to strain (or stress) range of the waveform, and then measures the reversals within the range. Damage from the envelope is added to the damage from the individual reversals within the envelope to calculate the damage of the whole cycle. The linear damage accumulation model is not valid for all loading conditions. Damage is accumulated in a linear fashion, assuming there is no wave-to-wave interaction. For Mode I (tensile) loading, this assumption is known to be false. Six mechanisms for-wave-to-wave interaction are known. The wave-to-wave interaction can significantly accelerate or delay fatigue crack propagation. In contrast, Mode III (tearing) loading has shown no wave-to-wave interaction. Very little research has been done to investigate damage accumulation in solder. The paper looks at single solder joints in shear. First the fatigue behavior of the solder joints is characterized using sine waves under displacement control. Then by looking at sums of waves with a constant displacement envelope, the damage from minor waves may be separated from damage from the major, envelope wave. The results show that the linear damage accumulation model (using rainflow analysis) is accurate as long as the minor waves remain in the elastic range. Once the minor waves begin to generate plastic deformation, the damage accumulates more rapidly than predicted.

THERMOMECHNICAL FATIGUE TESTING OF SOLDER ALLOYS:</B> <I>Mark A. Palmer</I>, P.E. Redmond, R.W. Messler, Jr., Materials Science and Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180
<P>
Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is one of the most common sources of failure in solder joints. TMF occurs due to thermal cycling, as a cyclic stress is induced on the solder joint due to thermal expansion mismatch. Due to the complicated nature of thermomechanical fatigue, directly testing a material's resistance to TMF is not straight forward. A novel test apparatus has been developed which allows the direct measurement of stress due to thermal cycling. The TMF behavior of three alloys, eutectic Sn-Bi, Sn-Pb, and Sn-Ag as examined by this apparatus will be presented. The data will be compared with that generated by other test methods.

FLIP CHIP SOLDER INTERCONNECTIONS--A RELIABILITY PERSPECTIVE: </B><I>Karl Puttlitz,</I> IBM Microelectronics, B/330-1AX44-173, GFKA, Rt. 52, Hopewell Junction, NY 12533
<P>
The solder ball flip chip or so-called C-4 connection was introduced by IBM nearly three decades ago as an alternative to manual wire bonding whose productivity and reliability were not acceptable at the time. A very large data base indicates that flip chips are the most reliable interconnection scheme in the industry since its inception. Moreover, the combination of C-4 mounted die and alumina multilayer ceramic (MLC) substrates provided the highest overall package reliability. This paper will discuss several key technical attributes such the joint controlled collapse feature, self-centering and throughput which is independent of die I/O count. Joint design, process, compositional and metallurgical factors will be discussed in the context of the very significant effect they have on reliability as well. Flip chip technology is flexible, having been successfully utilized with several generations of chip carriers. Important also is the ability to predict the thermal-mechanical (fatigue) behavior of C-4 joints. When attached to ceramic carriers, the failure rate of flip chip joints obey a distance-from-neutral point (DNP) dependence defined by the Coffin-Manson (C-M) relationship. Modifications to the C-M relationship necessary for this application will also be discussed. It will be shown that the technology is sufficiently extendible to satisfy the trends of smaller, lighter, faster, denser, etc. which are expected to continue in the future. New developments such as chip underfill and future trends including DCA and their reliability implications will also be discussed.

A NEW RELIABILITY ASPECT OF HIGH DENSITY INTERCONNECTIONS: </B> <I>Jorma Kivilahti</I>, Helsinki University of Technology, Materials and Manufacturing in Electronics, Vuorimiehentie 2A, Fin-02150 Espoo, Finland
<P>
Increasing importance of portability in telecommunication and consumer electronics is activating the research and development work on reliable, cost-effective fine-pitch interconnections and substrate technology alternatives. However, high density interconnections may produce increasing difficulties, e.g. in paste printing, component alignment and acceptable residual levels. Moreover, increasing microjoint densities are related to decreasing solder joint volumes, and therefore, it is even more likely that the whole solder volume will take part in the reactions, for example, between a solder, Flip Chip (FC) bump and substrate metallisation. Similar consequences of the miniaturization are encountered in the bump-limiting metallurgy; the total volumes (or thicknesses) of the diffusion barriers and adhesion layers and the original filler, alike, can transform into the matrix of intermetallics, which due to their inherent brittleness make the microjoints mechanically too weak to withstand thermal stresses. Accordingly, for confirming adequate reliability of microjoints it is essential to have better understanding and control on <I>metallurgical compatability</I> of dissimilar materials being in contact with each other. In this communication results of metallurgical studies on various FC bump-solder-substrate metallization reactions are presented. As specific examples, the bump-solder-substrate interactions have been studied experimentally with Au- as well as with Ni-bumped test chips, which were reflow-soldered with the eutectic SnPbAg filler at 235&#176;C for various times onto Au/Ni- and Cu-conductors on the FR-4 substrates. The electrical properties, structural integrity and evolution of microstructures (i.e., intermetallics, Pb-rich solution or eutectic structure) of reflow-soldered Flip Chip joints were examined in detail with the conventional tests and materials characterization methods. For studying the metallurgical compatibility and controlling the reaction kinetics between Au, Ni and eutectic SnPb and SnPbAg, the wedge-shaped diffusion couple experiments which more clearly illustrate the effect of solder layer thickness on the volume fraction of the intermetallics in the microjoints, were conducted using the RMA flux as well as a vacuum furnace. The thermodynamics of the AuSnPb, NiSnPb and CuSnPb systems were critically modeled and used for rationalizing the observed bump-solder-substrate reactions in the Flip Chip joints as well as in the diffusion couples. On the basis of metallurgical considerations a new Pb-free solution to this &quot;small-volume-problem&quot; is also addressed.

ELECTRONIC PACKAGING DESIGN FOR RELIABILITY:</B><I> William L. Olson</I>, Motorola Corporate Manufacturing Research Center, 1301 East Algonquin Avenue, Room 1014, Schaumburg, IL 60196
<P>
Consumer electronics products continue to increase rapidly in complexity while shrinking in size. This trend is driving development of a variety of new electronic packages that provide much higher interconnect density/in2 of PCB surface - without compromising the product's reliability or quality. This challenge has resulted in a proliferation of packaging alternatives including PBGA's, COB, micro-BGA, CSP and DCA. Selecting the most appropriate package for a given product requires careful engineering of the product's features, reliability and cost. My presentation will review the various semiconductor packaging approaches with an emphasis on design for high value and reliability. Results will be presented for a new multi-flip chip BGA package which provides excellent interconnect reliability for reasonable cost.

The optical transmitter and receiver modules were fabricated by applying flip chip bonding process. It was possible that the degree of alignment accuracy controlled below 1 &#181;m by the force of solder self-alignment. To minimize parasitic capacitance and inductance induced from the solder joint, the reflowed solder ball on Si substrate was varied from 100 &#181;m to 5 &#181;m. The Pb-In, Pb-Sn, In-Sn and In-Ag alloys as the bonding materials were deposited above UBM on the Si substrate by using thermal evaporation method. During the reflowing process, the behavior of solder ball formation, and the intermetallic compounds between the UBM and solder composition were inspected with various heating rates and the use of flux. During the flip chip bonding process, the solder joint shape and the gap between Si substrate and optical devices were controlled by means of a various temperature profiles and bonding force. The solder joints reliability of the flip chip bonded optical submodules were evaluated by shear, thermal shock, and thermal cycling test. In the case of the thermal shock test, the range of temperature was from 25&#176;C to the liquid N2. Thermal cycling numbers were 1000 cycles from -40&#176;C to 120&#176;C. These samples were analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM/EDS and TEM.

RELIABILITY CHALLENGES AND MODELING OF MINIATURIZED SOLDERED ASSEMBLIES:</B> <I>Jean-Paul Clech</I>, EPSI Inc., P.O. Box 1522, Montclair, NJ 07042
<P>
Miniaturized electronic packages have emerged that bring about new reliability challenges and, in some cases, have revived the concerns of Leadless Chip Carriers (LCCCs) on organic substrates: 1) most of these packages are leadless; 2) their Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) is low because of the high silicon contents of shrinking or disappearing packages; 3) the assembled packages may have a low stand-off height (for miniaturization purposes); 4) typical assemblies are very fine-pitch with micro-solder joints having smaller load bearing or crack propagation areas than conventional surface mount assemblies. The above attributes may be detrimental to long term solder joint integrity and suggest that reliability be looked at carefully, more so than with conventional surface mount assemblies. This talk will present thermal stress and reliability models that can help tackle those problems and ensure that assembly reliability is built-in during the early stages of product design. Two examples of engineering models of miniaturized assemblies will be discussed that enable rapid assessment of the impact of package geometry and materials on assembly reliability. The first example is a model of flip-chip assemblies with underfill. The model quantifies the solder joint relief provided by the underfill layer and its effect on assembly stiffness. The mechanics of flip-chip with underfill are unique since they involve an increase in assembly stiffness to provide for solder joint strain relief. The analysis is that of a multilayer structure (board/underfill/die) that deforms under thermal loads and 'external' forces and moments exerted by the solder joints. Predicted shear strains in the underfill layer are in good agreement with moir&eacute; measurements. In the limiting case where the shear modulus of the encapsulant is very low, the model converges to Hall's axisymmetric model for conventional LCCC assemblies. The analysis also gives interfacial stress distributions, a useful feature to assess whether the encapsulant/die and substrate interfaces are overstressed. Various parametric studies are conducted showing that the encapsulant modulus must be high enough to provide adequate strain relief in the solder joints, in agreement with experimental results and advanced finite element studies. Increasing the encapsulant modulus stiffens the assembly, because of mechanical coupling between the die and substrate, but the increased stiffness is overshadowed by much larger reductions in the solder joint strains. The second example is that of a micro-BGA construction where a compliant elastomer layer provides for decoupling between the die and substrate. The package is modeled as a multilayer structure (dielectric film/elastomer/die) where the low modulus elastomer layer behaves like an adhesive bond in shear. The analysis enables tailoring the compliant layer (modulus and thickness) to achieve targeted assembly reliability goals. Both mechanical models capture the reliability impact of the design parameters and materials in a quantitative manner. They can be easily implemented as PC-based design-for-reliability tools to conduct parametric studies on chip, board and assembly parameters.

QUALIFICATION TEST FOR SOLDER ATTACHMENT OF CHIP-SCALE BGA PACKAGING:</B> <I>Vern Solberg</I>, Tessera Inc., 3099 Orchard Drive, San Jose, CA 95134
<P>
Chip-scale package family for silicon products can be combined to help the engineer and designer meet the most demanding goals for electronic miniaturization,. The significant advantage to employing the miniature Chip-Scale Packaging (CSP) technology is three-fold: higher component density, more efficient assembly automation and enhanced product performance. Bare or unpacked die may be considered for miniaturization, however, a significant advantage a packaged device has over bare die is the ability to test and screen the product before surface mount technology, chip-scale BGA devices have proved efficient, rugged and easily adapted to existing high volume SMT manufacturing processes. Of primary concern to anyone utilizing a new technology is finished product reliability. In this paper, the author will describe several chip-scale device structures, the operational environments they are expected to withstand and the results of, long-term thermal stress testing of the 46 I/O &#181;BGA Flash Memory packages that have been reflow solder attached to conventional laminated circuit structures. Topics covered include: Standards for CSP Technology, Assembly Process Methods, Defining Product Use Environment, Planning the Assembly Test Strategy. Although many of the products being introduced in the miniature chip scale package are compatible with existing surface mount assembly processes, the contact size and pitch are relatively small. And although high assembly yields have been achieved, developing a reliable product using chip-scale devices requires uniform solder paste printing and continued assembly process monitoring.

Encapsulant materials for flip chip on board assemblies were developed to address the issues of thermal mismatch between the various materials used in this assembly methodology. Several experimental encapsulant materials with enhanced flow properties, shorter cure schedules, and lower stresses have been studied for their effect on manufacturability and their behavior as a compliant structure surrounding the solder joints. Materials characterization studies were performed on the various encapsulants to determine the glass transition temperatures (Tg), tensile elastic and loss modulii (E' and E''), flow profiles, coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), radii of curvature, stress relaxation as functions of temperature and moisture, and apparent strengths of adhesion. In addition, reliability tests were conducted using FR4 substrates populated with die and underfilled with the various encapsulants to determine the relationship between materials properties and, package and solder joint reliability responses.

It is well recognized that the thermal strains associated with material incompatibilities have been the root cause of many failures in both single chip microelectronic packages and in their soldered connections to circuit boards, etc. In so far as solder joints are concerned, flip chip interconnections and the joints under unleaded packages such as BGAs are in many ways &quot;worst case&quot; examples.

ISSUES AFFECTING RELIABILITY OF SURFACE MOUNT SOLDER JOINTS:</B> <I>Sung K. Kang</I>, IBM Corp., T.J. Watson Research Center, Room 37-250, P.O. Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598
<P>
Surface mount technology (SMT) has been practiced as the principal soldering method for the assembly of printed circuit boards (PCB) last ten years. SMT packages connected by solder joints occupy more than two thirds of a PCB real estate. SMT packages consist of both conventional formats such as small outline package (SOP), small outline 'J' leads (SOJ), plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCC), or quad flatpack (QFP), and fairly new packages such as thin small outline package (TSOP), tape carrier package (TCP), chip-on-board (COB), ball grid array (BGA), and many more. In this talk, recent developments of SMT soldering technologies are briefly reviewed, followed by discussion of several technical issues affecting the reliability of SMT solder joints. The subject matters to be discussed include solder joint defects, microstructure, interfacial reactions, thermal fatigue, and Pb-free solders.

RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN CHOOSING WATER SOLUBLE FLUX FOR ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY:</B> <I>Laura Turbini</I>, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Materials Science and Engineering, 778 Atlantic Drive, Atlanta, GA 30332
<P>
There is a need for a fundamental understanding of the interaction of processing chemicals such as fusing fluids, soldering fluxes and cleaning agents with printed wiring board substrates. This need is driven by two factors: (1) the increased density of today's electronic products creates voltage gradients which are high enough to enhance degradation modes which are not important for less dense circuitry, and (2) the elimination of chlorofluocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone depleting cleaning agents due to their destructive effect on the stratospheric ozone layer has lead to a proliferation of new soldering fluxes and cleaning agents whose interactions with the printed wiring board (PWB) are not well characterized. Water soluble fluxes have been effectively used in high volume electronic manufacturing operations for a number of years. Their use has increased dramatically as they provided an opportunity to eliminate CFCs in the cleaning process. They provide excellent soldering with low defect levels and with a proper cleaning process can produce highly reliable electronic circuits. However, some water flux and fusing fluid formulations contain ingredients which can have deleterious effects on the reliability of a product under certain operating and use conditions. There is a failure mechanism known as conductive anodic filament formation (CAF) which has been observed in PWBs boards treated with certain water soluble fluxes. This failure mode involves a debonding of the epoxy-glass interface and the formation of a conductive filament which grows along this interface from anode to cathode. This paper will report on those chemicals which tend to enhance this failure mode and will make recommendations on assuring the reliability of electronic assemblies.

INFLUENCE OF COMPONENT SOLDERABILITY ON RELIABILITY OF SOLDER JOINTS:</B> <I>Colin Lea</I>, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 0LW, UK<P>
The commonest mode of service failure of solder joints on circuit board electronics assemblies is low-cycle fatigue cracking from differential expansion during power-up and power-down of the equipment. The resistance of a solder joint interconnection to fatigue cracking is governed by both its microstructure and its geometry. In turn, these are both governed by the soldering process and the manner in which the molten solder wets and flows on the component metallisation; the component's solderability. Data will be presented, for surface mount assemblies, that relate component/circuit board solderability to solder fillet shape, and in turn to solder joint reliability. The best fillet geometry varies markedly between the many different styles and compositions of metallisation found on surface mounting components. Furthermore, the pass/fail criteria of solderability measurements are not necessarily related to the required solder fillet geometry for best reliability. Both infra-red reflow and wave soldering have been used, since the use of solderability on solder fillet shape may be quite different for the different manufacturing routes.

SOLDERABILITY AND SURFACE MOUNT SOLDER JOINT SHAPE PREDICTION:</B>  <I>D.J. Lewis1</I>, M.R. Notis1, G.C. Munie2, D.M.

As a part of a program supported at AT&amp;T Network Systems for continuous improvement in solderability, solderability modeling, and solderability specifications, an assembly trial was performed to determine the correlation of assembly yield to different combinations of solder volume, component coplanarity, component aging, and solder alloy. Through the use of wetting balance data and assembly yield statistics, soldering process charts correlating assembly yield to solder volume and coplanarity show that severe lead surface finish degradation would require (unmanufacturable) component coplanarities of less than 1 mil to maintain 100% assembly yield. The 132 I/O, 25 mil pitch, BQFPs were pre-conditioned using high temperature and humidity to degrade lead surface finish. Standard tin-lead solder and three commercially available lead-free solders were used to vary the solder wetting characteristics. To determine a process window for solderability, solder volume was varied by using two different stencil thicknesses, and coplanarity was measured to determine the effect of mechanical tolerance. Electrical continuity and visual inspection showed that assembly yield decreased with decreasing solder volume, poorer mechanical tolerance, and increased component aging time. Wetting balance data showed trends for aging conditions, but a correlation to coplanarity was not found. Contact angle results indicate that tin-lead had best wetting properties however this conflicts with assembly trial results where tin-lead had the higher failure level than the lead-free alloys. The goals of this project were: to further define a process window for solderability with tolerances for volume and coplanarity distributions; (2) to refine solderability specifications; and (3) to verify a computer model used to assess solder joint geometry and joint quality based on solder alloy and component lead properties. Assembly yield was examined based on different combinations of solder volume, component coplanarity, component aging, and solder alloy.

A SIMPLE DESIGN TOOL FOR EVALUATING LOW CYCLE SOLDER FATIGUE OF PACKAGE TO BOARD INTERCONNECTIONS:</B> Ted Carper, Robert Von Mayr and <I>Puligandla Viswanatham</I>, Texas Instruments Inc., Circuit Card Assemblies, 2501 South Highway 121, Mail Stop 3450, Lewisville, TX 75067<P>
Low cycle solder joint fatigue analysis is an important aspect of assessing the package to board solder interconnection performance of circuit card assemblies. A simple analysis tool that takes into account the significant environmental conditions for storage, operation, transportation, etc., and calculates the number of cycles to failure for a given set of input parameters is described. These parameters include coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of individual elements of the assembly structures, temperature, duration, number and frequency of cycles. Both leadless and leaded component configurations are included in the design of this tool. Lead stiffness for leaded components are calculated using equations published in the literature.

QUALIFICATION OF BALL GRID ARRAY ASSEMBLIES FOR SPACE FLIGHT APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Sharon Walton</I>, Kirk Bonner, Electronic Packaging and Fabrication Section, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109
<P>
JPL, in a partnership with an industrial consortium, is engaged in the investigation of reliability and quality issues of Ball Grid Array Packages as they may be applied to space flight electronics. Performing tests to determine the solder joint reliability of assemblies using BGAs under temperature cycling is proving to be a real challenge for test engineers. It was recognized early in the program that a large number of the BGA solder joints would be under test simultaneously and that some sort of computer based assistance would be required to accurately track the failures and the time at which they occurred. JPL has been using the National Instrument LabVIEW software and SCXI hardware to set up our system. The data acquisition program, DAQ.VI, was written around LabVIEW, a graphics based operating system. The program controls the temperature chambers, gathers data from the interface cards, logs data, and provides operator interface. This system can monitor over 1500 channels for electrical continuity and 32 channels for temperature. This software/hardware system greatly simplifies the task of monitoring and tracking failures and the conditions when the failures occurred of a large number of solder joint channels through the automatic gathering and recording of the test results onto a personal computer data base.

SOLDER JOINT INTEGRITY IN TESSERA'S &#181;BGA PACKAGE:</B> <I>Rao K. Mahidhara1</I> Vern Solberg, Tom DiStefano1 and Steve Greathouse2, 1Tessera Inc., 3099 Orchard Drive, San Jose, CA 95134; 2Intel Corp., CH6-315, 5000 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85226<P>
Chip-scale packages (CSP) are miniaturized IC packages that are being developed for applications ranging from memory chips to advanced high-performance processors. Adaptable to volume manufacturing, this type of package offers the performance and size advantages of a bare die, while conforming to the established infrastructure for electronic assembly. Tessera's &#181;BGA belongs to this new family of CSP, wherein the need to underfill the device has been eliminated. The reliability of solder joints in Tessera's &#181;BGA package is presented. Modeling studies on solder joint integrity have been conducted via finite element analysis (FEA) to predict stress and strain distributions at the solder ball-joint interfaces and potential failure points. The modeling work is complimented by studies involving ball shear testing and, intermetallic growth via optical/SEM/EDAX techniques following long time static annealing and temperature cycling. These reliability studies are suggestive that Tessera's &#181;BGAs are robust packages.

MECHANICAL AND CREEP CHARACTERISTICS OF Sn-3.5Ag FOR SOLDER-JOINT RELIABILITY:</B> <I>Hong Yang*+</I>, P. Deane*, P. Magill* and K.L. Murty+*, *Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; +North Carolina State University, P.O. Box 7909, Raleigh, NC 27695<P>
Constant-load creep and stress relaxation tests of Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy were performed at high homologous temperatures from 25&#176;C to 180&#176;C. Single lap shear tests were conducted on joined flip chip packages with 33X33 area array of Sn-3.5Ag solder bumps. Tensile creep tests were performed on bulk solder specimens. The steady-state strain-rates span 7 orders of magnitude ranging from 10-9 to 10-12 (1/s). The apparent activation energy of creep was found to be 0.57 ev. The stress exponent (n) in the power-law creep equation is found to be about 10 which is unusually high compared to that for many other metals. A constitutive equation relating stress, temperature and strain-rate for Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy was established. Low-temperature dislocation-climb deformation mechanism (with dislocation-pipe diffusion) is believed to be dominant in the medium-to-high stress region with power-law breakdown at very high stresses. Numerical simulations of a flip chip package were performed to characterize the failure modes. The effects of different design parameters were studied with regard to strain accumulation and stress distribution in the package under thermal cycles. Recommendations are made for design optimization. This work has been supported by the Microelectronic Center of North Carolina.

LEAD FINISH COMPARISON OF THREE LEAD FREE SOLDERS versus EUTECTIC SOLDER:</B> <I>Mark A. Kwoka, </I>Dawn M. Foster, Harris Corporation, Semiconductor Sector, P.O. Box 883, Melbourne, FL 32902<P>
The use of lead in electronics manufacture will probably be disallowed in the not too distant future. While data is currently being taken regarding the material properties of lead free solders, very little has been published regarding how the new lead free solders will respond to existing methods of solderability assessment. This study will provide an I.C. component lead finish comparision of three selected lead free solders with standard 63/37 Sn/Pb solder using wetting balance and &quot;Dip and Look&quot; solderability test techniques. In addition, an association between board level soldering performance, wetting balance and &quot;Dip and Look&quot; solderability test parameters of the lead free solders will be established.

QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF BGA AND SMT COMPONENTS:</B> <I>Reza Ghaffarian</I>, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109
<P>
Spacecraft electronics including those at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), demand production of highly reliable assemblies. JPL has recently completed an extensive study, funded by NASA's code Q, of the interplay between manufacturing defects and reliability of ball grid array (BGA) and surface mount electronic components. More than 400 test vehicles were assembled using ceramic and plastic BGAs, LCCs, J-leads, and gull wing components. These were subjected to thermal cycle testing and solder joint defects were logged prior to testing and solder damage propagation over time was documented. These findings offer valuable information to designers and quality assurance personnel alike on package robustness as well as in better understanding the defects that can actually lead to failure.

SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY AND LIFE PREDICTIONS FOR VARIOUS SMALL OUTLINE PACKAGES MOUNTED ON FR-4 BOARDS:</B> <I>Suresh Golwalkar</I>, Timothy Rothman, Paul Boysan and Robert Surratt, Intel Corporation, 1900 Prairie City Road, Folsom, CA 95630
<P>
TSOP or Thin Small Outline Packages have gained wide spread market acceptance throughout the electronic industry. This innovative and small footprint package was designed to fill a need created by the form factor specified for use in PCMCIA standard memory cards. However, with the broad and rapidly escalating acceptance of Flash products in the marketplace, this small outline package is being considered for a multitude of other use conditions. The small form factor of TSOP and accordingly short stiff lead form construction, requires further scrutiny in certain situations - specifically, applications requiring 20+ year lifetimes or others using 60 mil thick multi-layer FR-4 PCB's subject to extreme thermal cycling. Solder joint reliability is predominantly determined by two separate factors. The first being the surface mount process itself. Without a good initial solder joint, you can not expect good solder joint reliability. This fine pitch package (0.5 mm) requires different considerations than the existing 50 mil (1.27 mm) pitch type components. IR reflow profiles, solder volumes, and land pad layouts all contribute to proper fillet formation and a defect free solder joint. One must start with a good SMT process to have reliable solder joints. Second, is the use condition itself. Package/board configuration, operation conditions and thermal cycling of the board, drive solder joint reliability. In order to determine if TSOP is the correct package for a given application, various graphical presentations of failure rate versus service life are included in this paper. Solder joint evaluations were performed using various temperature cycle conditions. Data was taken using 64 mil thick FR-4 boards of various layer count and 20 mil thick 4 layer memory cards using 32Id, 40Id TSOP and 44Id PSOP packages. Temperature cycle conditions A, B and C were performed and Weibull probability plots were developed for each condition. Acceleration factors for solder joint fatigue is given by Norris and Landsburg equations. These include frequency transformations, temperature swing transforms, and a factor for variation of isothermal fatigue characteristics of solder joints between test and operating conditions. These equations yield use condition graphs. The graphs provided, show four different operational temperature swing conditions. Express, industrial, consumer, and computer conditions are depicted according to the IPC standards for these use variables. The extreme of the temperature swing and the frequency of swings per day, modulate the solder joint reliability. We have included both temp cycle condition A and B test data and modeled projections based on those. We feel that condition A more directly simulates real life use condition. Conditions B and C were used as highly accelerated conditions to obtain (trends only) swifter, but preliminary, failure predictions. As can be seen from temp cycle A cycling data, 50% failure point takes approximately six months to complete. PSOP data has ben included for completeness. As can be observed from the data, PSOP solder joint reliability, is oustanding for any application and any temperature range.

DEFORMATION ANALYSIS ON FLIP CHIP AND CSP SOLDER INTERCONNECT BY MICRODAC:</B> D. Vogel1, J. Auersperg2, A. Schubert1, B. Michel1, H. Relchl1; 1Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration Berlin, Dept. Mechanical Reliability and Micro Materials, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany; 2Technical University Berlin, Forschungssohwerpunkt Technologien der Mikroperipherik, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany
<P>
In order to enhance thermo-mechanical life time of solder interconnects in flip chip and CSP assemblies the design of new products is optimized by the help of Finite Element (FE) simulations. Solder stress reduction is achieved selecting proper materials and assembly geometry. Life time estimations and trends can be obtained by fatigue models, e.g., a Coffin-Manson approach, utilizing calculated stress and strain distributions. The performance of FE modeling depends on the quality of the provided input data, i.e. on load conditions, geometrical layout, constitutive material laws and on material parameters. Lacking data necessarily leads to simplifications. Consequently, comparable strain and stress measurements are requested to make FE results reliable. Often Moire deformation measurements are utilized for microelectronics purposes to obtain data for comparison with FE findings. Unfortunately, the method is faced with difficulties, if very small structures like single bumps have to be investigated and resolved. The new microDAC method applied in this work can overcome these problems. The underlying measurement principle is a correlation based computer algorithm. It allows to track local object pattern during load. A set of local patter displacements is treated to get strain and shear fields over the object surface. Until now thermal and/or mechanical load on flip chip and CSP specimens is realized inside scanning electron microscopes, as well as for optical and laser scanning microscopes. The picked up images for different load states are processed by the microDAC computer code. Measurements have been accomplished for flip chip and chip scale package solder interconnects. E.G., strains inside eutectic PBSn bumps of flip chip assemblies with highly filled underfill material have been determined by microDAC. Bump stresses were caused by the thermal mismatch between a low cost FR-4 substrate and the silicon die, heating up the assembly from room temperature. Measured deformation fields have been compared with FE results. The main strain features of FE simulation and microDAC measurement results correspond with each other. The hard underfill obstructs the shear of corner bumps. Consequently, shear strains (xy of corner bumps should not necessarily be a major reason of solder fatigue. Solder strains (xx in the perpendicular to the board direction are quite high. Their amount exceeds the value of unrestricted thermal strain of solder or underfiller material between a half and one order of magnitude. So, this strain component can significantly contribute to bump fatigue. Calculated (xx strains are at least three times lower than measured on the real component. The reason is assumed to be a anisotropic thermal expansion of the thin underfill layer. So, solder fatigue estimations only based on FE strain values can result in significantly higher life time values than realistic reached.

RELIABILITY FORMULATION FOR ELECTRONIC INTERCONNECTIONS: </B>Eugene Atwood and <I>Horatio Quintone</I>, IBM Microelectronics, B/330-81A, Route 52, East Fishkill Facility, NY 12533
<P>
This paper describes a novel reliability methodology, supported by data, which includes a rigorously derived stochastic formulation. As an introduction to this topic, the paper reviews and critiques methods currently used in the field of electronic interconnection reliability and presents supporting data illustrating the arguments set forth. Plausible physical explanations are presented for each of the factors used in the IBM modified Coffin-Manson acceleration model. The acceleration model is challenged because of its form which assumes linearly independent factors. A review of the log normal and extreme value distributions, commonly used to model system reliability of electronic interconnects, highlights deficiencies and violations of some of the basic mathematical axioms i.e., &quot;closure property&quot;. Additionally we present a refutation of &quot;theoretical derivations&quot; that have put forward to establish the validity of the log normal distribution as a model of fatigue fracture mechanisms. With regard to the main topic: today's thermal environments can no longer be defined by simple periodic functions, i.e., a fixed frequency and amplitude, but instead they tend to be &quot;highly no-periodic&quot; and of random nature. The randomness can be a result of the synergy between operating systems, software, use patterns and CMOS technology, e.g. temperature fluctuation patterns resulting from power management schemes defined in today's electronic devices. Present reliability formulations are not tailored to deal with this randomness. A rigorous formulation is presented that accounts for non-deterministic environments. The method treats the problem stochastically including the use of a novel distribution for time-to-fail, SCRIP (Statistics of Crack Initiation and Propagation) developed by the authors et al, and other system reliability formulations. An additional methodology is proposed which formulates electronic interconnection reliability in the presence of these random environments and extends the use of cycle/time based reliability assessments commonly used in the industry. The method consists of performing a series of renormalizations by discrete auto correlation and convolution integrals which are used to determine to determine the spectral power density function of the random environment.

SOME PHYSICS, KINETICS AND EMPERICAL RELATIONSHIPS RELATED TO FAILURE OF SOLDERED JOINTS:</B> <I>Barry Schlund</I>, Reliability Engineering Department, M/S H2121, Motorola GSTG, 8201 E. McDowell Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85252
<P>
The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the physical reasons behind what appears to be many self-contradictions encountered in solder reliability testing and experience. This is accomplished by presenting the underlying physical aspects of solder reliability, including workmanship, metallic and intermetallic bonding, interface mechanisms, diffusion, vacancy and void formation, work-hardening and softening, as well as smooth versus chaotic stress-strain behavior. Also discussed, is the criterion for successful application of finite element analyses in fatigue life calculations. It is hoped that this work will help bridge the gap between practitioners with opposing beliefs, for example those who believe in chaotic stress-strain behavior versus those who believe in smooth behavior. General guidelines for estimating the appropriate input conditions in the absence of accurate life profiles are provided. The use of the tool is demonstrated with several examples. These include: Thin Outline packages, Quad Flat packs, J-leaded components, and leadless Chip Carriers. A comparison of observed failures and calculated times to failure is provided.

<P>
Despite the studies performed in the last two decades to understand the fatigue behavior of the solder joints used in the electronic packages, the problem still draws big attention among the electronic package manufacturers. Fortunately, the studies performed provided a great improvement in the information about the behavior of the solder material under low-cycle-fatigue conditions. Based on the available information about the mechanical and fatigue behavior of solder material under thermal loads, the present authors developed the <I>volume-weighted averaging technique </I> for the fatigue life prediction of solder joints (A. Bilgic, &quot;Fatigue Life Prediction Methods for Thermally Loaded Solder Joints Using the Finite Element Method&quot;, Master of Science Thesis, Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN) and H. U. Akay, N. H. Padyar and A. Bilgic, Fatigue Life Predictions for Thermally Loaded Solder Joints Using a Volume-Weighted Averaging Technique, ASME Journal of Electronic Packaging, 1996 (in Review). The method consists of calculating the stresses and strains generated within a specific package by use of the finite element method and then correlating the calculated stress-strain response to the fatigue life by use of an energy-based fatigue life prediction criterion. The method was used to predict the fatigue lives of several arbitrary solder joints and the predictions were compared with the experimental data. The predictions were very encouraging. It is stated that the method does not differentiate between leadless and leaded solder joints or the loading applied on the packages. In addition, the method is very mesh-insensitive, implying that the number of nodes and finite elements used in the mesh has no major effect on the predictions. In this study, we extend our method to the fatigue life prediction of three-dimensional solder joints of resistors. The heating is provided by the power loading applied on the resistor. The differential thermal expansions within an assembly causes the thermal strains and stresses, as in the case in chip carriers. The analysis is performed in two steps: 1) A heat transfer analysis is performed to determine the spatial variations of temperatures during a power loading cycle; 2) Thermal stress analysis is performed to determine the thermal stresses and strains developed during the structure. The stress-strain response against the applied power loading is then used to predict the fatigue life using the previously developed <I>volume-weighted technique </I> and the fatigue life prediction criterion. The predictions are compared with the experimental data provided by others.

CRATERING IN 90:10 Pb:Sn CAST COLUMNS FOLLOWING SHEARING IN CAST COLUMN GRID ARRAY (CCGA) PACKAGES:</B> <I>M. Nemiroff1</I>, K. Economy2, Y. P. Geng3, T. H. Hao4, 1Cadence Corp., 10850 Via Frontera, San Diego, CA 92128; 2UNISYS Corp., 10850 Via Frontera, San Diego, CA 92128; 3Institute for Mechanics and Materials, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093; 4China Textile University, Shanghai, China
<P>
Void-like features have been observed on sheared surfaces on 90:10 Pb:Sn columns in ceramic cast column grid array (CCGA) packages. The feature sizes are typically 3-5 mils across. These features are not voids. They are crater-like fractures caused by the shearing tool. Shearing with a heavy tool causes extensive cratering. Shearing the columns with a razor blade produces far fewer, if any, of these void-like features. These craters are a concern since they can be mistaken for voids which affect the reliability of CCGA devices. The surface of these features are devoid of large (greater than 2-3 micron) tin-rich regions normally in the bulk of the column. The tin-rich regions have lower toughness than the Pb-rich matrix in the two-phase 90:10 Pb:Sn cast column. Cratering can be explained as a mechanism where the shearing tool creates a crack that propagates around these tin-rich regions. Micromechanical models have been established to simulate crack propagation (a) through and (b) around the tin-rich area. The results show that the energy released for case (b) is less than that of case (a) even though case (b) has a longer crack path.

EXPERIMENTL STUDIES OF SMT SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY:</B> <I>K. M. Leung</I>, Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Kong Kong
<P>
SMT solder joints between ceramic chip carriers and printed circuit boards are found in general to suffer large thermal strains and stresses during device operation under repeated power cyclings. A comprehensive study of the thermomechanical behavior of SMT solder joints has been performed under power cycling using different techniques of optical interferometry. This paper will discuss the detailed analysis of these experimental measurements and its implication on fatigue life estimation of SMT solder joints. Other major experimental studies on solder joints reliability performed at the City University will be reviewed as well.

SOLDER JOINT INTEGRITY OF A PWB WHERE AN ELECTROLESS PALLADIUM FINISH WAS USED AS A SOLDERABILITY PRESERVATIVE:</B> <I>George Milad</I> and Kuldip Johal, Autotech (USA) Inc., 12609 Pinecrest Road, Herndon, VA 20171
<P>
A thin layer of 6.0 to 8.0 microinches (0.1 to 0.2 microns) of electroless palladium deposited directly on the copper surface of a printed wiring board has exhibited excellent solderability. This new surface offers a series of advantages over the traditional Hot Air Solder Leveling (HASL). It is flat, coplanar, which is a must for successful screen printing of fine featured devices. It is lead free and environmentally friendly. Other than being solderable it is also wire bondable and has applications as a viable surface finish for contact switching or compression contacts. Characteristics of palladium are discussed. Data of solder joint reliability is presented. The data includes an in depth EDX analysis of metallurgy of the interface between palladium coated copper pads and the solder forming the joint, under various accelerated aging conditions. The solder joint has been subjected to 2000 thermal cycles per IPC standard testing procedures. The results indicate no impairment in resistivity of solder joint integrity.

RELIABILITY EVALUATION OF CHIP SCALE PACKAGES BY FEA AND MICRODAC:</B> J. Auersperg1, D. Vogel2, J. Simon1, A. Schubert2, B. Michel2, 1Technical University Berlin, Forschungssohwerpunkt Technologien der Mikroperipherik, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany; 2Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration Berlin, Dept. Mechanical Reliability and Micro Materials, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355 Berlin, Germany
<P>
Chip Scale Packaging is one of new hot topics in electronic packaging where Chip Scale Packages are defined by size, which should be nearly chip size. Different types of CSPs have been developed. They may be classified by the technological concept, e.g. waferlevel (including molding), flip chip with interposer (rigid, flex) and the well known (BA. The mechanical reliability mainly is determined by the packaging technology. The package design has to compensate stresses caused by the thermal mismathc between its components. Different CSPs approaches were analyzed by thermomechanical Finite Element Analysis simulating a thermal cycling process with respect to the complex mechanical behavior of the different materials used, e.g. the creep effect in solder joints, the temperature dependence of material parameters, the visco elastic behavior of underfill materials. The results will be discussed from the aspect of an estimation of the mechanical reliability. Several types of SCPs with a great variety of materials used are evaluated in such a way. The sensitivity of the related values to changes of material and geometrical parameters was used to enhance the thermo-mechanical life time. Experimental methods are applied to obtain accurate input data for the FEA. The comparison of the results from FEA with those obtained from microDAC strain measurement method helps to fit the model data utilized in numerical simulations for more realistic physical models and makes the FE results reliable. This work is part of a national CSP project with partners from German industry.

<P>CORRECTION FACTORS TO THE CLASSICAL NUCLEATION RATE:</B> <I>David T. Wu</I>, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520
<P>
The rate of nucleation can have a strong influence on the microstructure of thin films. This talk discusses corrections to the classical expression for nucleation rate. For heterogeneous nucleation's spherical cap model a new contact-angle dependence for the prefactor is presented, while in homogeneous nucleation the self-consistency correction is reconsidered using the idea of &quot;kinetic potential.&quot; Both corrections can increase the nucleation rate significantly.

<P>
We present a study of thin film growth by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this investigation of metal growth onto Si substrates, the effects of chemical kinetic processes on both film structure and morphology are determined. Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to identify the nucleation sites and to monitor island growth during the submonolayer regime. Analysis of measured island size distributions reveals the importance of site-specific chemical reactions and precursor molecule diffusion. Also, we monitor the development of surface roughness of thicker films by x-ray reflectivity. These experiments demonstrate the influence of nucleation rate on surface morphology. Finally, we show how CVD kinetics can be manipulated by use of adsorbates which passivate chemically - reactive substrate sites. Adsorbate layers have been used to modify the nucleation rate and fabricate nanometer - size structures via selective - area growth. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Chemically vapour deposited (CVD) alumina is frequently used as a wear-resistant coating on cemented carbide cutting tool inserts. Two crystallographic modifications of alumina are used, a-Al2O3 and k-Al2O3, often in combination with TiN, TiC, and Ti(C,N). In this paper, the microstructures of single and multilayer coatings of CVD k-Al2O3 have been investigated. The aim of this work was to describe the detailed microstructure of the coatings and relate this to mechanical properties and tool life. Deposition of the experimental coatings was carried out in a computer-controlled hot-wall CVD reactor. The coatings were examined by analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/EDX and TEM/EDX).

Staton-Bevan, Department of Materials, Imperial College, London SW7 2BP, UK; Z. Trajanovic, I. Takeuchi, T. Venkatesan, Department of Physics, University of Maryland, MD 20742
<P>
A HRTEM study of an YBCO/Nd2CuO4/YBCO trilayered films on LaSrGaO4 substrate with PBCO as a template layer has shown that in-plane aligned a-axis oriented YBCO films may be grown on (100) LaSrGaO4 substrates by pulsed laser deposition, which contain some domains with the c-axis misaligned by 90&#176; in plane of the films. A Nd2CuO4 insulating layer, with a thickness of approximately 10nm, may be grown epitaxially between a-axis oriented YBCO layers with its c-axis parallel to the c-axis of the YBCO layers. A 90&#176;-misoriented a-axis YBCO grain in the lower YBCO layer can nucleate a 90&#176;-misoriented Nd2CuO4 grain in the a-axis oriented Nd2CuO4 layer and this grain can further nucleate a 90&#176;-misoriented YBCO grain in the top YBCO layer. Narrow vertical Nd2O3 plates were observed in 90&#176;-misoriented Nd2CuO4 grains formed epitaxially with the Nd2CuO4 grains. The interface between the PBCO template layer and the LaSrGaO4 substrate is quite rough with some amorphous islands in the template layer.

<P>
High critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductors have captured the interest of engineers and scientists world wide. For its commercial utilization in the field of microelectronics and electronic systems, they must be fabricated into desirable configurations, thin and thick films. During studies it has been observed that these superconducting thin films operating at liquid N2 temperature offer great possibilities for faster, more sensitive and precise electronics devices. Present paper reviews the fabrication techniques of high-Tc superconducting thin films which primarily includes Pulsed-Laser Deposition, Molecular ion beam epitaxy, Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) by using epitaxial growth on single crystal substrates (YSZ, MgO, Si, etc.) with excellent microstructural control and properties relationship. In addition to it, thick film fabrication is also discussed with major techniques like Screen Printing and Plasma Spraying along with associated processing parameters. Furthermore, advanced applications of each are enumerated at length.

SURFACE AND INTERFACE STRESS EFFECTS ON THIN FILM GROWTH</B>: <I>R.C. Cammarata</I>, Surface and Interface Science Branch, Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Associated with any solid surface is a surface stress. It is an intrinsic thermodynamic quantity that represents the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch the surface. In materials where there is a large surface area to volume ratio, such as thin films, surface stresses can have a major influence on the growth and structure. In the case of a solid-solid interface, there are two interface stresses that represent the work needed to stretch the two phases on either side of the interface. Simple models for surface and interface stresses will be presented. These will then be used to analyze thin film epitaxial growth as well as intrinsic stress generation in nonepitaxial films. It will be shown that surface and interface stresses play a central role in determining the critical thickness for epitaxy, and can lead to significant intrinsic stresses in nonepitaxial films, especially during the early stages of growth.

<P>STRESS MONITORING DURING THIN FILM GROWTH:</B> Jerrold A. Floro, Eric Chason, Sandia National Labs, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185-1415
<P>
<P>Thin films are typically deposited under severe kinetic constraints, resulting in highly non-equilibrium microstructures. These films often exhibit stress levels far in excess of the bulk yield strength. The origin and evolution of the film stress during deposition is, in most cases, poorly understood. We have developed a technique for real-time measurement of film stress during deposition--the Multi-beam Optical Stress Sensor (MOSS). MOSS is a technique for determination of stress through measurement of the substrate curvature. It has the virtues of low sensitivity to ambient vibration, simplicity of setup, and ease of use. We will describe the technique, and demonstrate its use for the particular case of SiGe heteroepitaxial growth on Si. We first discuss the elastic/plastic behavior of SiGe, and then focus on the surface segregation of Ge during SiGe growth. The latter topic, while somewhat specialized, is well-suited to demonstrate the interpretation of MOSS data, and to highlight both the strengths and limitations of the technique.

EPITAXY AND STRESS IN METAL THIN FILM COMPOUNDS AND MULTILAYERS:</B> <I>B.M. Clemens</I>, T.C. Hufnagel, V. Ramaswamy, M.C. Kautzky, C.T. Wang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93405-2205
<P>
Epitaxial growth can be used to control and help understand thin film properties. We use sputter deposition to grow a variety of epitaxial thin film structures, including compounds and multilayers. The large stresses observed in these materials can have a large effect on properties. Using in-situ stress measurements and x-ray diffraction we study the stress evolution during growth and relate this behavior to thin film structure and properties. For Fe on Cu (001), we find that Fe is fcc up to a thickness of 10-12 monolayers, whereupon bcc Fe is observed in first the Pitsch and then the Bain orientations. The fcc Fe shows some relaxation of the misfit from the Cu, as do the Pitsch orientation bcc, which is in tension, and the Bain orientation bcc, which is in compression. In the giant magnetostrictive compound TbFe2, we have used epitaxy and differential thermal contraction to control the stress and hence the orientation of magnetization. This understanding and and control can lead to improved device performance.

THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF PZT THIN FILMS DEPOSITED BY A SOL-GEL TECHNIQUE:</B> D.F. Bahr, J.S. Wright, L.F. Francis, N.R. Moody*, W.W.

<P>
Lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) thin films are used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as piezoelectric components. Both the mechanical and electrical properties of the PZT layer must be known in order to understand the piezoelectic response of the PZT for use as either a sensor or actuator. These properties are controlled by the composition and structure of the PZT film and its interface. Variations in PZT film structure and morphology are caused by changing solution processing conditions. PZT films have been deposited to thicknesses between 400 and 600 nm onto a multilayered electrode structure of platinum, titanium, titanium dioxide and silicon oxide. Nanoindentation has been used to characterize the effects of grain size and structure on the mechanical properties of the PZT films. The effects of the substrate and the multilayered electrode are accounted for to determine the modulus and hardness of the PZT films.

ADHESION OF CVD TiN ON 316L SURGICAL STAINLESS STEEL OBTAINED IN A MASS TRANSFER REGIME</B>: <I> M.H. Staia,</I> School of Metallurgy and Materials Science, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 49141, Caracas 1042-A, Venezuela; C. Julia Schmutz, Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology Incorporated, P.O. Box 41, Neuchatel, Switzerland
<P>
An investigation has been undertaken to study the adhesion of TiN coatings deposited by using CVD process at 900&#176;C on surgical stainless steel. The microscratch test method (CSEM) was employed to evaluate the coating adhesion. Three scratches were performed at progressive load under the test conditions. Observation of the surface damages by means of an optical microscope permitted to determine the critical load. No acoustic emission detections or frictional force fluctuations could be correlated with the optical observations. In this investigation, the critical load corresponds to the regular occurrence of delamination. Scanning electron microscopy provided the essential and detailed information about the mode of failure of the coatings along the scratch channel. It was found that the coatings presented high plastic deformation and cohesive fracture at values lower than the critical load, Lc.

GRAIN GROWTH IN POLYCRYSTALLINE THIN FILMS:</B> C.V. Thompson, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, M.I.T., Cambridge MA 02139<P>
Polycrystalline thin films are used in a wide variety of applications, especially in electronic and magnetic devices and systems. In these applications, the properties, performance and reliability of polycrystalline films are strongly affected by the average grain size, grain shapes, the way in which grain sizes are distributed and the distribution of grain orientations. These vary with deposition technique and with deposition conditions, and can also be modified through post-deposition processing. The factors which affect the structure and crystallographic texture of polycrystalline films will reviewed and categorized. Approaches for process development for application-specific optimized structures will be outlined.

NEW MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF POLYCRYSTALLINE GOLD THIN FILMS:</B> Alexander H. King, Varun Singh, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-2275<P>
We have made detailed observations of unsupported gold thin films, using transmission electron microscopy. These films embody a strong [111] fiber texture, as found in many FCC metal thin films. Rotations of individual grains about the [111] surface normal are observed and we present a simple model that mimics this behavior, providing a reasonable explanation for it. We will also present an analysis of the triple junctions in the films showing that symmetry is the most significant factor in determining the energy associated with a triple junction. We will show that supposed &quot;U-lines&quot; do not embody the disclinations that are expected on the basis of Bollmann's analysis.

MODELING OF GRAIN GROWTH IN THIN FILMS WITH TEXTURE:</B> <I>Harold J. Frost</I>, Johan Grape, Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH<P>
We have developed our two-dimensional simulation of grain growth to include several effects which apply for the case of large-grained polycrystalline thin films in which the grains completely traverse the film thickness and the grain boundaries are all nearly perpendicular to the plane of the film. To properly include the effects of texture we must include the following factors which differ among individual grains based on crystallographic orientation: surface energies for the film-substrate and film-covering interface; elastic compliances, and the related strain-energy densities when elastic strains are imposed; yield stresses, which limit the elastic strains and strain-energy densities. In this paper we will expand on previous treatments by explicitly allowing for variations in grain boundary energy and mobility, based on the 
 relative misorientation of neighboring grains. In this case, the grain growth evolution favors pairs of grains separated by low angle (low energy) grain boundaries. Such low energy boundaries generally separate grains of the same texture component. Other effects, such as pinning by surface grooving, pinning by precipitate particles or holes in the film, and solute drag may also be included in the simulations.

POST-PATTERNING MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION OF Al-Cu INTERCONNECT LINES:</B> <I> D. P. Field</I>, TexSEM Laboratories, Inc., 226 W. 2230 N., Provo, UT 84604<P>
Optimization of microstructural features in interconnect lines for integrated circuits is becoming increasingly important for device reliability as the minimum feature size continues to shrink. Recent efforts have clearly demonstrated that not only grain size and precipitate morphologies are affected by the patterning and subsequent anneal, but also the crystallographic texture and grain boundary structure evolve during this process. For narrow lines, the (111) fiber texture sharpens and the near-bamboo grain structure is controlled by interface area minimization and grain boundary energy minimization. The current work describes the competing energetics associated with the process. Experimental results using orientation imaging microscopy as the analysis technique on Al-1% Cu interconnect lines are shown to support the analyses.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC TEXTURE EVOLUTION DURING FILM FORMATION AND ANNEALING IN SPUTTERED Al ALLOY/Ti AND Al ALLOY/TiN/Ti LAYERS:</B> <I>J.E.

<P>
Ti, TiN and Al alloy thin films comprise the basis for patterned metallization interconnects in advanced integrated circuit devices. Ti in particular has been shown to provide increased reliability of the primary Al conductor against electromigration-induced failures. A proposed mechanism is for this improvement is increased Al (111) film fiber texture due to the presence of the Ti underlayer. A review of extensive Al texture characterization by x-ray diffraction methods will be presented for various Ti, TiN, and Al layering schemes and sputter deposition conditions. Factors such as substrate surface energy, substrate roughness, Al grain growth, and &quot;texture inheritance&quot; between layers will be discussed. Deposition and processing schemes for improved Al (111) texture and improved interconnect reliability will be provided.

THE EFFECT OF MICROSTRUCTURE AND LOCAL MICROSTRUCTURE VARIATIONS ON ELECTROMIGRATION FAILURE DISTRIBUTIONS:</B> <I> Dirk D. Brown</I>, AMD, Sunnyvale, CA 94088; John E., Sanchez, Jr., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; Matt A. Korhonen, Che-Yu Li, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850<P>
In narrow metal lines used for chip level interconnects, the electromigration reliability is affected by variations in the microstructure. Electromigration failure distributions were obtained experimentally for six different Al-Cu interconnect widths, ranging from 1mm to 8mm. Or each of these line widths, the microstructure was characterized (using TEM) and the initial stress distribution was calculated. This information was used, with a flux divergence model, to simulate the entire failure distribution for each line width. These simulations, when compared to the experimental failure distributions, were used to quantify important material parameters, such as atomic diffusivities and failure criteria. This information, in turn, can be used to accurately extrapolate electromigration data. A detailed failure analysis was carried out on the simulated lines to study the effect of microstructure variations on electromigration failure.

LOCAL GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION IN VOIDED COPPER INTERCONNECTS:</B> <I>R.R.

Nucci, Cornell University, School of Electrical Engineering, Phillips Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853; D.P. Field, TexSEM Laboratories, Inc., 226 West 2230 North #120, Provo, UT 84604<P>
We have characterized grain boundary structures and local textures in oxide passivated copper lines which had undergone thermal stress-induced voiding. Grain boundary misorientations and the crystallographic character of boundary planes were determined for individual grain boundaries using electron backscatter diffraction in the scanning electron microscope as well as focussed ion beam images. We have summarized the data for a number of boundaries immediately adjacent to voids and made direct comparisons to boundaries from regions which remained intact. These data were acquired from the same lines, and so represent measurements from material with identical thermal histories. The results suggest that significant variations in local structure exist in narrow lines, and that those local regions associated with more favorable kinetics are more susceptible to void formation and growth.

EVOLUTION OF GRAIN STRUCTURE IN THIN FILM REACTIONS:</B> <I>K. Barmak</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
The granular nature of polycrystalline thin films is playing an increasingly important role in their performance as the dimensions of the grains and those structures in which the thin films are used become comparable. Consequently, greater attention is being paid to the factors that affect the grain structure of thin films and its evolution. This paper will address the evolution of grain structure during the reaction of polycrystalline thin films. Experimental evidence from calorimetry, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies of a number of thin film systems will be reviewed and the role of reactant phase microstructure in these reactions will be highlighted. Theoretical models that combine nucleation and growth processes in the formation of the product phase will be presented and the impact of heterogeneous boundary nucleation on the evolution of grain structure in thin film reactions will be discussed.

THE MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIN FILM COPPER GOLD ORDERED INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS:</B> <I>Jonathan Gorrell</I>, Paul Holloway, Dept. of Material Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-6400; Hal Jerman, EG&amp;G IC Sensors, 1701 McCarthy Blvd., Milpitas, CA 95035
<P>
Recent developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have created a need for stronger metal thin films that are resistant to stress relaxation. Intermetallic compounds are noted for their strength and resistant to creep, but these properties have rarely been studied in thin films of intermetallics. We have sputter deposited layered structures of copper and gold so that the intermetallic compounds Cu3Au, CuAu and CuAu3 would form. The samples were initial heated to 475&#176;C to allow intermixing of the copper and gold layers and the evolution of the intrinsic and extrinsic stresses were characterized during the process. The samples were then annealed at temperatures where the intermetallic phases would form. The intermetallic phases were tested for strength and stress relaxation using a Tencor Flexus 2320. The microstructure and composition were examined with TEM, EDX, Electron Microprobe, and X-Ray diffraction. This data allows us to relate strength and resistance to stress relaxation to microstructure and the heat of formation of the various copper gold intermetallic compounds.

CHARACTERIZATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN Al INTERCONNECTS BY ORIENTATION IMAGING MICROSCOPY:</B> <I>C. Wu</I>, C.L. Bauer, B.L. Adams, W.W. Mullins, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA
<P>
Characterization of microstructure (grain orientation, grain-boundary inclination, microtexture, etc.) in thin-film interconnects is especially important because grain size usually approximates film thickness, thereby enhancing short-circuit diffusion induced by electric fields (electromigration), mechanical stress (stress voiding), temperature gradients (thermomigration), and capillarity (grain-boundary grooving). In this research, grain boundaries in polycrystalline Al interconnects have been characterized by orientation imaging microscopy and analyzed in terms of the interconnectivity of triple junctions. In general, results indicate that a variety of thermodynamic and kinetic properties can be extracted by rapid acquisition and processing of large data sets and correlated with the (five) degrees of crystallographic freedom of individual grain boundaries.

REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS OF MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION IN Ag THIN FILMS ON SiO2:</B> <I>Eric Chason</I>, Jerry Floro, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-1415; Steven C. Seel, Carl Thompson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA
<P>
Understanding and controlling the microstructure in thin metal films used for IC interconnects is essential for maintaining high reliability. Although the microstructure of Al films has been heavily studied, the switch to Cu for interconnects in the future will lead to different microstructural evolution than in current technology. In order to study the kinetics of grain growth and texture evolution, we have developed an in situ X-ray system that can measure the concurrent evolution of (111) and (100) textured crystallites during annealing. We present results from the annealing of Ag films, which have similar elastic properties to Cu. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04.

STRESS RELAXATION AND THERMAL EVOLUTION OF FILM PROPERTIES IN AMORPHOUS CARBON:</B> <I> J.P. Sullivan</I>, Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185
<P>
Large stress relaxation is observed in amorphous carbon films deposited by pulsed-laser deposition which are subsequently thermally annealed. In the as-deposited state, the films exhibit very high compressive stress, &gt; 6 GPa, which has been thought to be either necessary or unavoidable in order to form a high percentage of 4-fold coordinated (diamond-like) carbon bonds and which can also hamper important electronic applications of these films. Stress measurements performed in situ and ex situ following thermal annealing up to 600&#176;C indicate the stress may be reduced nearly two orders of magnitude. The stress relaxation is not dominated by interfacial relaxation nor is it accompanied by large scale changes within the film (e.g. graphitization) as indicated by in situ and ex situ electrical measurements, ex situ X-ray reflectivity, Raman spectroscopy, and experiments using different substrates. The bonding structure and mechanisms of thin film evolution in these unique amorphous films will be discussed. Work at Sandia was supported by an LDRD through the U.S. DOEunder contract no.

MICROSTRUCTURE AND TEXTURE DEVELOPMENT IN CUBIC BORON NITRIDE THIN FILMS:</B> <I> D.L. Medlin</I>, P.B. Mirkarimi, G.F. Cardinale, K.F. McCarty, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore CA 94551
<P>
Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is an sp3-bonded material with many properties and applications that are similar to diamond. Although cBN can be synthesized in bulk form at high temperature and pressure, synthesis in thin film form requires the simultaneous bombardment of the growing film with a high flux of energetic ions. cBN films grow with a unique, layered microstructure in which sp2-bonded graphitic boron nitride initially forms near the substrate interface, and nucleation and growth of the sp3-bonded cubic phase occurs further up in the film. Both the graphitic and cubic layers exhibit strong preferential crystallographic orientations: the graphitic layer possesses a strong in-plane [0002] orientation, whereas the cBN possesses an in-plane [111] orientation. This preferential orientation is consistent with an alignment between the cBN {111} planes and the basal planes of the layer of highly oriented graphitic boron nitride that forms in the initial stages of film growth. This relationship provides insight into the mechanisms controlling the initial nucleation of cBN and subsequent microstructural evolution of the films. This work is supported by the U. S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 and in part by OBES-DMS.

CHARACTERIZATION OF SrRuO3 THIN FILMS: MICROSTRUCTURE/PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP:</B> <I>F. Chu</I>, Q.X. Jia, C. Adams, T.E. Mitchell, Materials Science and Technology Division, Mail Stop K 765, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545; Q. Zhu, Physics Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973
<P>
Metallic oxide SrRuO3 thin films have been grown using pulsed laser deposition on LaAlO3 substrates at different substrate temperatures. The surface morphology and microstructural properties of the SrRuO3/LaAlO3 system have been studied using high resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, conventional x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Electrical properties of SrRuO3 thin films with different microstructures have been measured. It is found that films deposited at 250&#176;C are amorphous, and show semiconductor-like temperature dependence of electrical conductivity. Films deposited at 425&#176;C are crystalline with very fine grain size (100~200&Aring;), and show both metallic and semiconductor-like temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity in different temperature regions. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy unambiguously indicate that epitaxial [001] and [110] growth of the orthorhombic films takes place for deposition temperature above 650&#176;C, where the [001] texture is dominant. Films deposited at 775&#176;C show a resistivity of 280 mW-cm at room temperature. Microstructures of epitaxially grown films and possibilities for improving the thin film growth are discussed, based on geometric considerations for both film and substrate. The optimized deposition conditions to grow SrRuO3 thin films on LaAlO3 substrates have been found. Possible engineering applications of SrRuO3 thin films with different microstructures are discussed.

LOW-ENERGY ION AND HYPERTHERMAL NEUTRAL BEAMS FOR FILM GROWTH: EFFECTS ON NUCLEATION, MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION, EPITAXIAL THICKNESS, ROUGHENING, AND STRAIN RELAXATION:</B> <I>Joe Greene</I>, Materials Science Dept., Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Low-energy (10-100 eV) ion and hyperthermal neutral irradiation during filmgrowth from the vapor phase are used to provide new chemical reaction pathways, modify film growth kinetics, and, hence, controllably alter film properties. During low-temperature epitaxial growth from hyperthermal Si beams, critical epitaxial thicknesses were increased by up to an order of magnitude over those obtained with MBE due to enhanced interlayer mass transport and more effective filling of interisland trenches. For heteroepitaxial Si1-xGex growth on Si(001), AFM and XTEM studies show that strain-induced roughening, which occurs at elevated growth temperatures, is strongly suppressed at Ts between 300 and 400&#176;C, with no indication of low-temperature kinetic roughening. The use of low-energy primary- ion beam sources in which ion energy and ion/neutral flux ratios can be varied independently during the growth of Al, Cu, and TiN polycrystalline layers on SiO2 will be shown to provide dramatic differences in nucleation rates, mosaicity, preferred orientation, strain, and microstructure evolution.

GLANCING-ANGLE ION BOMBARDMENT FOR MODIFICATION AND MONITORING OF SEMICONDUCTOR SURFACES:</B> J.G.C. Labanda,<I> S.A. Barnett</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208; Lars Hultman, IFM, Link&ouml;ping University, S-581 83 Link&ouml;ping, Sweden
<P>
Using glancing-angle ion bombardment for surface modification rather than conventional near-normal incidence ions has the advantages of reducing damage and implantation projected ranges, reducing channeling, reducing sputtering, and preferentially removing surface asperities leading to flat surfaces. The effect of bombardment conditions on the surface morphology and perfection of GaAs(001), InP(001) and Si(001) surfaces are reported. Air-exposed surfaces were cleaned and smoothened to near atomic flatness without damage for optimal conditions: for example, with GaAs this was observed for 1000 eV Ar ions incident at 15&#176; from the surface plane at a dose of 2x1016 ions/cm2. For a given set of bombardment conditions, ion damage (observed as small dislocation loops in a 20-30 nm thick surface layer) decreased with decreasing ion incidence angle, and was eliminated below a critical angle. Sputtering yield, measured using film thicknesses and changes in reflection high-energy electron diffraction oscillations, decreased with decreasing incidence angle. The low sputtering yield and minimal damage make a glancing-angle geometry ideal for real-time characterization by ion scattering spectroscopy. Surface composition measurements on single monolayers of InAs on GaAs showed that the glancing-angle Ar beam did not did not measureably change the In coverage over relatively long times.

INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING PARAMETERS ON THE STABILITY OF MAGNETRON SPUTTERED DEPOSITED GROUP VI THIN FILMS:</B> <I> M.J. O'Keefe</I>, Avionics Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433
<P>
Sputter deposition of metallic thin films is commonly used to fabricate electrically conducting contacts and interconnects on semiconductor devices. For military applications, the stability of the patterned metal under adverse environmental conditions, such as prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, can significantly influence the reliability of the device. In this investigation the influence of magnetron sputter deposition processing parameters on the stress, adhesion, resistivity and crystal structure Group VI (i.e.. Cr, Mo, W) thin films was studied. The influence of elevated temperature on the stability of the films was evaluated, in part, using a Tencor Flexus-2900 thin film stress measurement system. Results from the study indicate that minor changes in processing conditions can significantly affect the as-deposited and elevated temperature properties of the films.

<P>
The Stranski-Krastanov growth morphology of heteroepitaxy consists of three dimensional islands that nucleate on top of a few strained layers of film material that wet the substrate. It is well understood on the basis of energetic considerations that such islands can be entirely free of misfit dislocations, i.e., coherent, until they grow rather large. But the kinetic processes that govern their formation are far less clear. Motivated by recent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies of this phenomenon for Ge/Si(111), InAs/GaAs(001), and InSb/GaAs(001), we present a combination of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field rate theory designed to reveal the kinetic pathways to coherent islands. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of interface alloying and the dynamics of the wetting layers.

MORPHOLOGICAL INSTABILITIES AND EVOLUTION OF THIN FILMS:</B> H. Wong, P.W. Voorhees, M.J. Miksis, S.H. Davis, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208
<P>
The driving force for morphological evolution of thin films increases as the size of the films decreases. Thus, to further miniaturize microelectronic and optoelectronic devices, the morphological instability and evolution of thin films need to be understood. We study the linear instability of two film shapes commonly encountered in experiment: a strip on a substrate, and a hole in a uniform film on a substrate. We assume that the instability is driven by capillarity and the film evolves via surface diffusion. The contact angle is fixed at a value between 0 and 180 degree. We find that both film shapes are unstable to certain disturbances. We also simulate numerically the evolution of the film shapes triggered by an unstable disturbance to reveal new stable steady states. The implications of these results on the long term stability of solid-film devices will be discussed. *Supported by NSF and DOE.

NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE STRESS DRIVEN 2D TO 3D TRANSITION:</B> <I>D.E. Jesson</I>, Solid State Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6030<P>
An understanding of the stress driven 2D to 3D transition is central to many key issues in materials science including the growth of planar but strained semiconductor layers and the fabrication of quantum dots. We will overview our current understanding of the transition and identify the conditions under which stress driven instabilities occur during film growth. Nucleation mechanisms of roughening compete with instabilities and this will be illustrated by annealing experiments which demonstrate the formation of rippled surface morphologies by cooperative nucleation events.

SPONTANEOUS COMPOSITION MODULATION IN SEMICONDUCTOR ALLOYS</B>: <I>Joanna Mirecki Millunchick</I>, Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM 87195-0601<P>
Lateral composition modulation (CM) has been observed to occur spontaneously in III-V semiconductors, producing quantum wires. CM is presumed to originate from surface undulations arising from compositional inhomogeneity, as well as lattice mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate. We observe CM in homogeneous alloys or in short period superlattices. Samples were characterized using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM), polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy (PPL), reflection difference spectroscopy (RDS), and magneto-luminescence (ML). For example, XTEM micrographs of InAs/GaAs superlattices show contrast due to CM only in the projection, with a period 150&Aring;. PL measurements show that emission is red-shifted and polarized with a ratio of up to 4. InAlAs buffer layers, on the other hand, have much higher polarization ratios (up to 10), indicating that these films may also be compositionally modulated. XTEM images of nominally lattice-matched InxGa1-xAs / InxAl1-xAs superlattice structures grown on InP (001) show that only the InAlAs layers exhibit contrast due to CM along the direction, in agreement with polarized PL results. The modulation period for such a structure deposited at Ts=475&#176;C, for example, is 50&Aring;. Preliminary temperature-dependent PL and ML results for InAlAs epilayers show that the emission is independent of T and B, suggesting carrier confinement due CM. These phenomena are under investigation in an effort to determine the dependence of the material system on CM. Finally, a model of the effect of CM on the band structure will be discussed.

STRUCTURAL STABILITY OF LOW TEMPERATURE GROWN InGaAs/GaAs HETEROSTRUCTURES:</B> <I>Chanro Park, </I>C.G.

Noh, Materials Evaluation Center, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Taejon, 305-340, Korea<P>
Microstructural evolution of the InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures grown by MBE at low temperatures (200-250&#176;C) has been studied using double crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Dislocation formation was suppressed at low growth temperatures, and the layers sustained metastable structures which would undergo microstructural change at high temperatures. Misfit dislocations formed at InGaAs/GaAs interfacial region during annealing relieved accumulated strain caused by lattice mismatch between the InGaAs and GaAs. Arsenic precipitates formed during the annealing process also played an important role for strain relaxation by forming misfit dislocations along matrix/As interface. Structural stability of the low temperature grown layers in discussed in terms of the microstructural evolution observed at various growth and annealing temperatures.

This session will present five papers describing the major unit processes of copper extractive metallurgy. The five unit processes are: smelting, converting, fire refining and casting, electrolytic copper refining, and copper solvent and electrowinning. As set forth in the title of this seminar, the companies participating were chosen as exemplars of the finest practice in their particular area of copper extractive metallurgy. The goal of this session is to provide an accurate description and clear understanding of these unit processes. This session will provide a overall knowledge of the extractive metallurgy of copper, particularly useful to those outside the copper industry.

The kinetics and temperature dependence of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> transformation in Ti-(46-48) at.% Al alloys was studied using a novel computer-controlled temperature and electric resistivity acquisition system. Samples of the alloys were heated by controlled direct resistance heating and cooled at various rates by a helium jet quench. In situ, real time, high speed, simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity and temperature were made during both heating and cooling. Using the resistivity and thermal arrest data, the start and finish temperatures of the various transformation modes, viz., lamellar, Widmanstatten/feathery and massive were determined as a function of cooling rate. The data obtained was correlated with light and electron microscope observations to establish transformation diagrams, and to determine the growth rate of the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase as a function of undercooling. The experimental data was fitted into physical models and thermodynamic quantities such as the enthalpies/driving forces of formation of the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> were determined. The activation enthalpy for boundary diffusion estimated from this data indicates that the massive transformation is controlled by interfacial (rather than volume) diffusion. Defect structures in the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase and the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-parent interface were characterized in detail by TEM. The implications of these studies on the mechanism of the massive transformation will be discussed.

<P>
A thermodynamic description of the Ti Al system is developed in this study. Nine phases were considered in this system. They are disordered solution phases: liquid, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">&#173;(Ti, Al), <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">&#173;(Ti, Al), (Al); ordered intermetallic phases: <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2&#173;Ti3Al, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">&#173;TiAl, TiAl3 and stoichiometric compounds: TiAl2, Ti2Al5. The Redlich Kister equation was used to describe the excess Gibbs energy for the disordered solution phases; the generalized quasi-chemical model recently developed in our research group was used to describe the ordered intermetallic phases. The parameters describing these models were obtained by optimization using the experimental phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data available in the literature. The quasi-chemical model is an extension of the Bragg Williams model similar to the extension of the regular solution model for disordered solution phases. Thermodynamic values obtained from the model parameters as well as the calculated phase diagram are in good agreement with the experimental data. The intrinsic defect concentrations calculated from the model parameters for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">&#173;TiAl are compared with the predictions of the first principle calculation, the semi empirical relationship and the available experimental data, reasonable agreement is obtained. The model parameters for the ordered intermetallic phases can be converted to the format of sublattice model and Wagner Schottky model.

<P>
The phase relations in Ti-Al based systems are by no means well established except for the case of a few specific ternary systems. This lack of information is now being exacerbated as new generation alloys are commonly multi-component in nature. Thermodynamic phase diagram modeling for Ti-Al-X systems has been presented previously which can now form the basis for the extension of the modeling technique to multi-component alloys. Examples of calculations for a variety of multi-component alloys will be shown and the effect of light elements such as O will also be modeled. An important factor in the success of the calculation method is that the ordering of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">2 can now be incorporated. 1.

EFFECTS OF SUBLATTICE ORDERING AND COMPOSITIONAL UNCERTAINITIES ON THE DETERMINATION OF ACCURATE AND PRECISE DEBYE-WALLER AND STRUCTURE FACTORS IN TIAL:</B> S. Jayanthi, <I>S. Swaminathan, </I>H.L.

<P>
There has been significant interest aimed at determining the anisotropy of charge densities in the intermetallic compound TiAl. Such determinations require the accurate measurement of low order structure factors, which in turn requires an accurate knowledge of the Debye-Waller factors of the given alloy/compound. Hence, the quest for assessments of charge densities in TiAl has involved determinations of the Debye-Waller factors and structure factors. The first of these are conveniently extracted from single crystal x-ray diffraction experiments, and it has been found that in samples whose compositions are Al rich sub-lattice ordering occurs, such that there are unequal values of the Debye-Waller factors for the two Ti sites. The effect of this sub-lattice ordering on the determination of the Debye-Waller factors has been assessed and will be discussed. Furthermore, the effect of compositional uncertainties on the determination of both Debye-Waller factors and structure factors has been investigated. It has been shown that sample compositions must be known to within &#177;0.15at.% for accurate determination of charge densities. These limitations will be discussed, and an experimental approach to overcome these will be detailed.

<P>PHASE RELATIONS AND ALPHA DECOMPOSITION IN Ti-(25-50) Al ALLOYS:</B> <I>Y-W. Kim</I>, UES, Inc., Dayton, OH 45432
<P>
The phase relations in Ti-(25-55) at.%Al involved in the decomposition and transformations of the high temperature alpha phase were investigated by conducting annealing/cooling experiments in a cooling/heating rate range of 0.2-100&#176;C/min. X-ray and differential thermal analyses were conducted to determine phase relations, transformation temperatures and enthalpies involving various alpha-decompositions. Three types of decomposition reactions were found to exist, depending on composition and cooling rate, that is; I: <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2; II: <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif">L(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">); and III: <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif">L(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">' + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">)<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif">L(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">'2 + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">). In Types II and III, the undercooling and the lamellar spacing (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/lambda.gif">L) for the lamellar structure (L) were related to cooling rate and Al content. The ordering reaction in Type III, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 took place at increasingly higher temperatures (with Al content) than the Type I extrapolation due to the compositional changes. Both Type I and II reactions are favored in low Al-content alloys; however, they (Type II in particular) could take place even in Ti-48Al. This and the other reactions will be analyzed in detail.

Small amounts of boron additions are known to effectively refine the alpha grains in hot worked TiAl alloys when heat treated in the alpha field, resulting in the formation of fine lamellar colony microstructures. The boron additions raise significantly the critical cooling rate above which the formation of fully lamellar structures begins to be suppressed. Since this cooling rate allows the lamellar spacing to be controllable to a greater range, it is critical to understand the formation mechanism and kinetics of gamma laths in the presence of boron (in the form of borides). For this, annealing and cooling experiments and microstructural observations have been conducted on forged alloys of Ti-(42-47)Al-(0-0.5)B. DTA measurements are underway to detect the undercoolings before gamma precipitation in the alpha matrix as a function of cooling rate. The results will be presented and analyzed to explain the role of borides on the grain refinement, the formulation of gamma precipitates, and the retardation of nonlamellar microstructure formation.

When a hexagonal close packed crystal, with ideal c/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> ratio, is sheared by Shockley dislocations on alternate basal planes the resulting crystal is face centered cubic. The six Shockley vectors generate cubic structures in two orientations which are twins of each other. When the DO19 structure is sheared by the same six Shockley vectors the result is three different 12H structures and their three twins. These 12H structures are composed of tetragonal unit cell building blocks, having axial ratios 1:1:/2. In this description, all of the {100} planes have alternate compositions Ti, TiAl and the unique c axes are in six different directions, one resulting from each of the six Shockley shears. The 'tetragonal' description of the structures is the same as the tetragonal structure L10 except that in L10 the {100} planes have alternate compositions Ti, Al. Thus, shearing the DO19 structure in one of the Shockley directions by 1/2:/2 creates a crystal structure which is as close to L10 as the composition allows. The six variants of gamma may therefore be formed from a single crystal of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 by the operation of dislocations with the six available Shockley Burgers vectors so long as the composition may be corrected by diffusion.

<P>A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF STABLE AND METASTABLE FORMS OF <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TIAL:</B> J.M.K. Wiezorek, <I>X.D. Zhang</I>, R. Banerjee, H.L. Fraser, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
Numerous theoretical, first principle calculations studies have shown that the interatomic bonding in TiAl is a mixture of covalent and metallic. There is a need to complement these studies with experimental observations. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is capable of providing electronic structure information through the near edge fine structure in core loss peaks, since these reflect the combined effects of bonding parameters such as charge transfer, hybridization, and variation of the crystal and ligand field. In this paper, EELS has been used to study the electronic structure of stable and metastable forms of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl. The near-edge EELS signatures of the equilibrium phases at Ti-25at.%Al, Ti-75at.%Al and Ti-52at.%Al have been used to assess the suitability of this experimental method for the study of the electronic structure in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl compounds. Metastable phases of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-50at.%Al and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-Ti-48at.%Al have been generated by very rapid quenching from the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-phase field, and thin amorphous films of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Ti-48at.%Al have been deposited by magnetron sputtering. The near edge structure of these phases have been studied using a field emission TEM equipped with an imaging parallel EELS. Furthermore, results for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-Ti-36at.%Al and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-52at.%Al in binary lamellar TiAl are presented. The results of this study are discussed with a view to the mechanical behavior and the phase stability of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl based compounds. This work has been supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation with Dr. Bruce MacDonald as program manager.

<P>
Recent work has suggested that near-fully lamellar or fully-lamellar microstructures may provide attractive combinations of room and elevated temperature properties in near-gamma titanium aluminide alloys. The development of such microstructures via thermal processing high in the two-phase (alpha+gamma) field or in the single-phase (alpha) field is described. In particular, the interaction of the dissolution of gamma grains and the growth of alpha grains during isothermal and transient heat treatment processes will be summarized. Models for the kinetics of gamma grain dissolution and alpha grain growth will be presented. The broad application of such models for the design of heat treatments to obtain fully lamellar microstructures will be illustrated for several forged gamma components.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys (i.e., Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb(at.%)) have ultrafine fully-lamellar structures after processing or heat-treatment above the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-transus temperature; such structures produce outstanding high-temperature strength. The lamellar colonies consist of fine laths of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phases, with 100-200 nm average lamellar spacings and 200-500 nm <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 spacings. Generally these structures are dominated by <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 interfaces rather than <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> interfaces, and they are relatively free of various structural defects often found in fully-lamellar structures. Aging studies of different alloys at 800-1000&#176;C indicates that dissolution of the fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 lamellae is one of the critical first steps that triggers instability and continuous coarsening of the overall lamellar structure during aging or creep. This paper focuses on detailed TEM/AEM characterization of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 component of the microstructure and how that information feeds into designing better TiAl alloys.

The a precipitation kinetics, volume fraction and packet thickness depend strongly on the aging temperature, generally increasing with increase in temperature. These changes are also accompanied by significant hardening with time at temperature, from the initial value to a maximum, followed by a decrease at longer times. The morphology of the resulting microstructures, nucleation mechanisms, orientation relationship between the phases, sub-structure development and kinetics of precipitation during the transition will be discussed.

THE ORDERING TIE LINES AND TIE TRIANGLES IN TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> D.-H. Hou, <I>H.L. Fraser</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The site occupancies of alloying elements in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl and the ordering states in orthorhombic titanium aluminides are investigated using the newly developed Ordering Tie Line (OTL) analysis. The OTL, which can represent the atom configuration in an ordered alloy in a graphical and intuitive way, is a parameter that is unique to ordered alloys. There are two properties of an OTL, one being its slope, indicating the trend for sublattice occupancy, and the other the compositional endpoints, corresponding to the <I>compositions</I> of the individual sublattices. The slope can be determined conveniently by Atom Location by Channeling Enhanced Microanalysis (Alchemi) experiments, whereas the compositional endpoints may be determined either from additional information concerning the ordering scheme or determined by other experiments/simulations. In the present study, compositional endpoints are determined by simulation using the dynamical theory of electron diffraction. The OTL analysis which was originally developed for ternary compounds has been further extended to quaternary systems such as TiAl with two alloying elements and ternary system with three sublattice sites such as the orthorhombic alloys based on Ti2AlNb. For the TiAl alloys, the effect of alloying elements of Nb, Cr, Mo and Mn on the OTL are determined and discussed. For the orthorhombic alloy, it will be shown how the ordering state can be described by the Ordering Tie Triangle (OTT), and how to measure the OTT by the Alchemi experiments. Since the OTL can provide a direct measure of the ordering state, it will be an important parameter for alloy design. This work has been supported by the US ONR, Dr. George Yoder as Program Manager.

<P>DECOMPOSITION OF <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha-bold.gif">2-Ti3Al LAMELLAR STRUCTURE:</B> <I>J. Zhang</I>, Z.H. Zhang, D.X. Zou, Z. Y. Zhong, Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing 100081, China
<P>
<P>It's found in the cast Ti-46.5Al-2.5V-1.0Cr (at%) ingot, that the discontinuous coarsening (DC) dominates the decomposition of the lamellar structure when annealing at temperatures lower than 1273K while the continuous coarsening (CC) does at the temperature between 1373K and 1473K. In the case of CC, the lamellae coarsened segmentally and then the FL microstructure decomposed to a finer equiaxed near gamma (NG) microstructure as annealing time went on. The TEM observation showed that the prior lamellae are quite neat and perfect and the annealed lamellae have inner terminations. Thus, the Rayleigh's perturbation and breakdown of lamellae was believed to have occurred along with the CC. Furthermore, a cycle heat treatment of 1173K-1423K has been designed to increase the density of the inner terminations of lamellae. After that, the FL microstructure has been decomposed to a more homogeneous and even finer equiaxed NG microstructure.

MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION DURING POSTWELD HEAT TREATMENT OF GAS TUNGSTEN-ARC AND ELECTRON BEAM WELDS IN CAST Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb ALLOY:</B> W.A. Baeslack III, C.M. Jensen, H. Zheng, Department of Industrial, Welding and Systems Engineering, Ohio State University , Columbus, OH 43210; T.J. Kelly, GE Aircraft Engines, 1 Neumann Way, Evendale, OH 45215
<P>
The microstructures of multi-pass gas tungsten-arc (GTA) welds produced in cast Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb (at.%) have been evaluated in the as-welded condition and following postweld heat treatment over a range of temperatures from 1000 to 1300&#176;C. Although postweld heat treatment did not significantly affect the cast, HIP'ed and heat-treated base metal microstructure, it did promote transformation of a predominantly lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> microstructure in the as-welded fusion zone, to microstructures comprised principally of equiaxed <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> grains. An increase in the heat treatment temperature resulted in an increased proportion of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 located principally at <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> grain boundaries and grain boundary triple points. These microstructural changes were associated with softening and toughening of the fusion zone, both of which increased with an increase in postweld heat treatment temperature. Featureless, hard bands (&gt;400 DPH as-welded) observed to parallel the fusion boundaries, which exhibited an extremely fine lamellar microstructure, were also softened by postweld heat treatment, although they remained harder than the surrounding weld metal microstructure. This work was supported by a grant to the Carnegie Mellon University from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

INTERACTION BETWEEN TIAL AND ALN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES:</B> <I>Y. Paransky, </I>E.Y. Gutmanas, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel<P>
In this work, interfacial reactions between TiAl intermetallic and aluminum nitride have been studied in the 800-1200&#176;C temperature range. Titanium aluminides are developing as a new group of materials for high temperature applications. Their load bearing capacity can be considerably improved by introducing high strength ceramic fibers, such as SiC or boron. Due to the high reactivity of Ti-containing materials, chemical interaction between fibers and TiAl matrix takes place at the processing and/or service temperatures resulting in deterioration of mechanical properties. Fibers can be protected by a thin coating layer which dissolves slowly enough to prevent the matrix from attacking the fiber during the composite lifetime. AlN is a possible choice for such a coating in Ti-containing matrices. Interfacial reactions between AlN and TiAl matrix have been studied using the diffusion couple approach. Phases growing at the interface between TiAl and AlN have been identified by XRD, SEM/EDS, AES and TEM; the kinetics of reaction layer growth has also been investigated. It has been found that AlN is more stable in TiAl than in pure Ti. In the latter case, the dissolution of AlN is faster due to the higher activity of Ti and high diffusivity or nitrogen in Ti.

PROCESSING-PROPERTY-MICROSTRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS IN TiAl-BASED ALLOYS:</B> <I>M H. Loretto</I>, D. Hu, A. Godfrey, T.T. Cheng, I.P. Jones, P.A. Blenkinsop, IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston B15 2TT, UK<P>
A range of TiAl-based alloys has been produced by plasma melting either small buttons (1kg samples) or ingots (up to 50kg). These alloys have been subsequently processed using isothermal forging, extrusion and/or HIPping. Some problems associated with the melting and subsequent processing of these alloys will be discussed and the ways found to overcome these problems outlined. Microstructural data obtained from some of these alloys will be presented which show the relationship between processing route and microstructure, and these observations will be correlated with mechanical properties. It will be shown that the microstructure can be closely controlled by appropriate processing and further that for a range of alloy compositions the properties can be controlled more by processing than by composition. For other alloys the composition is more important.

DEFORMATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE Ti-48Al: </B> <I>L.S. Kim</I>, T. Klassen, C.J. Altstetter, R.S. Averback, Materials Science and Engineering Department, University of Illinois, 1304 W. Green St., Urbana, IL 61801<P>
When the grain size is a few tens of nanometers, TiAl is ductile at moderately elevated temperatures. Such grain sizes were produced by ball milling of titanium and aluminum powders, which must be consolidated without excessive grain growth. Green compacts (80% dense) were sinterforged at temperatures near 650&#176;C, achieving relative densities of 99%. The final grain size was roughly 60 nm. The deformation temperature is several hundred degrees below those used for sintering microcrystalline powders. Pore elimination is promoted during sinterforging by the deviatoric stress components due to the absence of die- wall constraints. The resultant shear deformation is undoubtedly enhanced by grain boundary deformation modes in nanocrystalline material. Hardness measurements at moderately elevated temperatures are used to develop the constitutive relation for deformation of TiAl. Densification and deformation have been studied as a function of temperature, load and grain size.

ROLE OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON SUPERPLASTICITY IN <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>R.S. Mishra</I>, A.K. Mukherjee, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis, CA 95616<P>
A number of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys exhibit superplasticity. The optimum superplastic temperature is strongly dependent on the grain size. For materials with grain sizes &gt;10 &#181;m, the superplastic temperatures are above <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 transition temperature. On the other hand, superplastic temperatures for materials with grain sizes &lt;5 &#181;m is below 1373K. Surprisingly, however, the state of second phase, i.e., ordered <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 or disordered a does not influence the kinetics of superplastic deformation and the parametric dependencies remain similar. These observations suggest that the slip accommodation and dislocation climb in g phase as the rate controlling mechanism. Some new results on nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl are presented, which shows the possibility of low temperature superplasticity. The flow stresses in submicrocrystalline and nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys are consistent with a slip accommodation model.

MICROSTRUCTURE AND TENSILE PROPERTIES OF ROLLED GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDE:</B> <I>Gopal Das</I>, Pratt and Whitney, P.O. Box 109600, West Palm Beach, FL 33410-9600; Helmut Clemens, Plansee AG, Technology Center, A-6600 Reutte, Austria<P>
Gamma titanium aluminide (Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B, Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si at. %) sheets were produced by near-isothermal rolling of forged material. The microstructures resulting from annealing of the rolled sheets below and above the eutectoid temperatures were studied by a combination of optical, X-ray, SEM, and TEM methods. Transition temperatures including the alpha transus temperature were determined by DTA and annealing experiments. Textures were studied on as-rolled and annealed sheets. Tensile properties of annealed specimens were determined at RT-800&#176;C. Deformation microstructure was analyzed by TEM and fractographs were studied by SEM. In the case of Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si at. % the influence of strain rate on the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature was studied for different microstructures. Additionally, the superplastic behavior was investigated for Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si (at. %) sheet in the temperature range of 1000-1100&#176;C. The results will be presented and the underlying deformation mechanisms discussed. The Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B sheet material was provided by McDonnell Douglas and AFWL/MLLM and the portion of the work based on Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B sheet material was supported by NASA LeRC, Cleveland, OH, under Contract No. NAS3-26385<I>.</I><P>

EFFECT OF EXTRUSION TEMPERATURE ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF A POWDER METALLURGY TiAl-BASED ALLOY:</B> <I>L.M. Hsiung</I>, T.G. Nieh, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P. O. Box 808, L-370, Livermore, CA 94551-9900; D.R. Clemens, Advanced Engineering Operations, Pratt &amp; Whitney, West Palm Beach, FL 33410-9600<P>

The microstructure of a P/M Ti-47Al-2Cr-1Nb-1Ta (at.%) alloy powder-extruded at different temperatures has been studied. Three different temperatures: one near to the eutectoid temperature (T1), one within the (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) two phase field (T2), and one at a phase field (T3), were employed for the extrusion. The as-prepared powder consists of mainly <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> phase and small amount of supercooled <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">/B2 grains and a fine-grained (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) duplex structure. The observation of stacking faults coexisted with thin <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> plates within the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 grains reveals that stacking faults are intimately related to the formation of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> plates within the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 phase. A nearly fully lamellar (FL) structure composed of alternating <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 lamellae is developed for the alloy extruded at T3. Both lamellar grain size and lamellar interface spacing are finer than those in conventionally processed FL TiAl alloys. <P>

SUPER TRANSUS PROCESSING OF Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr ALLOYS:</B> <I>G.E. Fuchs</I>, Lockheed Martin Company, P.O. Box 1072, Schnectady, NY 12301-1072<P>
Fine grained lamellar microstructures would be expected to exhibit high strength, high creep strength, high fracture toughness and moderate ductility. This presentation discusses the use of high temperature extrusion to produce fine grained lamellar microstructures in both ingot and powder metallurgy Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr alloys. The effect of processing parameters, such as extrusion temperature and cooling rate, on the microstructure and properties are examined. In addition, the thermal stability of the fine grained microstructures was examined by subsequent heat treatments. The results of this study indicate that fine grained lamellar microstructures can be generated in both ingot and powder metallurgy materials. However, the selection of the appropriate processing parameters is required to optimize the microstructure and properties.

DENSE IN SITU TIAL IMCS VIA PRESSURE-ASSISTED THERMAL EXPLOSION:</B> I. Gotman, C. Zakine, <I>E.Y. Gutmanas</I>, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel<P>
Dense <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl and in-situ TiAl based IMCs were fabricated via pressure-assisted thermal explosion. Fine Ti-Al powder blends with and without the addition of BN or NiB were used as the starting reagents. Rapid heating to the ignition temperature of thermal explosion was realized via resistive heating or by placing the reagent compacts into a preheated pressure die. The presence of an additional low temperature phase in the composition with NiB greatly assisted the process of consolidation. The application of a moderate external pressure (&#190; 200 MPa) during processing was shown to be enough to accommodate negative volume changes associated with reactive synthesis and, thereby, to ensure full density of the final product. Microstructure and phase composition of the materials obtained were characterized employing x-ray diffraction and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) with energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The entire procedure of thermal explosion under pressure could be performed in open air without noticeable oxidation damage to the final product. Rapid cooling due to heat transfer into the pressure die allowed to prevent the coarsening of microstructure in the materials synthesized. The formation of a finely distributed reinforcing phase resulted in high mechanical properties of the in-situ TiAl matrix composites.

PROCESSING AND PROPERTIES OF INVESTMENT CAST, NEAR-BINARY TIAL ENGINE EXHAUST VALVES:</B> Steven G. Dettloff, Wesley R. Thayer, <I>Walter W. Milligan</I>, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931<P>
Near binary gamma TiAl engine valves were investment cast by the Hitchener process. Effects of HIP temperature, pressure and time on mechanical properties and microstructure were investigated, and the HIP process was optimized for ductility. A HIP + heat treat study was able to separate the beneficial contributions of porosity closure and microstructural development. Effects of iron additions on the optimum aluminum content were noted and will be discussed. We gratefully acknowledge the support of GM Powertrain, Ron Cafferty and Paul Mikkola, who provided the valves and financial support, as well as the National Science Foundation, under grant DMR-92-57465, which is monitored by Dr. Bruce MacDonald.

AUTOGENOUS GAS TUNGSTEN ARC WELDABILITY OF CAST ALLOY Ti-48Al-2Cr- 2Nb VERSUS EXTRUDED ALLOY Ti-46Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.9Mo:</B> V.L. Acoff, <I>D. Bharani</I>, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Box 870202, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0202
<P>
In the majority of the engineering applications for which gamma based titanium aluminide alloys are being considered, fusion welding is the primary form of joining. Sound (crack and void free) welds using the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process with matching, or near matching, filler metal have been accomplished. However, procedures for consistently producing crack-free autogenous (without filler metal) GTA welds have not been achieved. This paper will discuss the autogenous gas tungsten arc weldability of cast alloy Ti-48Al-2Cr- 2Nb (at.%) and of extruded alloy Ti-46Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.9Mo (at.%) and will compare their resultant fusion zone microstructure and properties. Samples were spot welded without any preheat. Microstructural characterization has been performed using optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system. Mechanical properties of the fusion zone will be discussed in terms of Vickers microhardness numbers and tensile testing.

THE ROLE OF GRAIN SIZE AND SELECTED MICROSTRUCTURAL PARAMETERS IN STRENGTHENING FULLY-LAMELLAR TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>D.M. Dimiduk</I>, Wright Laboratories Materials Directorate, WL/MLLM, WPAFB, Dayton, OH 45433; P.M. Hazzledine, T.A. Parthasarathy, UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Road, Dayton, OH 45432; S. Seshagiri, SYSTRAN, Inc., 4126 Linden Ave., Dayton, OH 45432
<P>
More than five years ago wrought processing was first used to produce fully-lamellar microstructures in TiAl alloys having grain sizes less than ~400mm. These alloys exhibit an improvement in overall balance of properties, especially at high temperatures. More recently, such microstructural forms led to exceptional yield strengths (&gt;1000Mpa at low temperatures), while maintaining attractive high-temperature properties. The improvements appeared to be attained principally through an unusually high apparent sensitivity of strength on grain size. Studies reported an apparent value for the slope of the &quot;Hall-Petch plot&quot; approaching 5 Mpa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif"> for fully lamellar gamma alloys, while that for single phase or duplex microstructures is near unity. The present investigations examine the slope of the Hall-Petch plot for fully lamellar microstructures, paying particular attention to the lamellar microstructural variables. Results show that <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-lamella thickness and spacing, and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-lamella thickness can vary over more than two orders-of-magnitude. These in turn influence the value of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">o in the Hall Petch plot, and often change concomitantly with grain size in processing. Nonetheless, the corrected value of the Hall-Petch constant exceeds a magnitude of 2 Mpa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif">; and it is strain dependent. The investigations also examine dislocation activity, flow behavior, glide barriers and slip multiplicity for polysynthetically twinned or PST crystals (single-grain analogue of fully lamellar material), then map this behavior into an explanation of the yield behavior of high strength fully lamellar gamma alloys.

BULK, DEFECT, AND INTERFACIAL PROPERTIES OF TiAl and Ti3Al:</B> <I>M.H. Yoo,</I> C.L. Fu, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831
<P>
Available theoretical and experimental data on the elastic constants, point defect properties, shear fault energies, and ideal cleavage energies of TiAl and Ti3Al are reviewed, including the recently calculated <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> interfacial energies. Enhanced slip by ordinary dislocations along pseudo-twin and rotational <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> and the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> interfaces is a contributing factor to the strong plastic anisotropy of a fully lamellar microstructure. According to the calculated interfacial fracture energies, cleavage cracking is to occur on <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> boundaries and the least likely on true-twin boundaries. The roles of misfit dislocations, kinetics of dislocation-interface interactions, and hydrogen embrittlement in deformation and fracture of two-phase TiAl alloys are discussed. This research was sponsored by the Division of Materials Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy, under contract number DE-AC05- 96OR22464 with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation.

INTERNAL STRESSES IN LAMELLAR TiAl:</B> <I>P.M. Hazzledine</I>, UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Road, Dayton, OH 45432; M.A. Grinfeld, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University, P.O. Box 909, Piscataway, NJ 08855; D.M. Dimiduk, Wright Laboratories Materials Directorate, WL/MLLM, WPAFB, Dayton, OH 45433
<P>
Internal stresses necessarily develop in multilayered coherent materials with mismatched lattice parameters as the individual layers adjust to their neighbors. In Ti-Al the layers consist of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 plates and six orientation variants of gamma plates which occur in an apparently random sequence. The internal stresses in any one layer are affected by the orientations of all its neighbors. We have calculated, in closed form, the stresses present in one layer of a stack of gamma layers in which the sequence of variants is in any order and of any length and in which the thicknesses of each layer may take any value. In addition we have calculated the stresses in a stack of alternating <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> layers of arbitrary thicknesses. The results are applicable directly to an idealized form of PST TiAl in which the domain size is large and the lamellae thickness is small. The relaxation of internal stresses which occurs in thick lamellae and by the formation of domains is discussed. The consequences of both these relaxations to the plastic strength of PST TiAl are examined.

Quantitative relationships will be presented for the prediction of basic mechanical properties (yield/ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness and plastic elongation to failure) at room- and elevated- temperature. These include Hall-Petch relationships between basic mechanical properties and the average equiaxed grain size/lamellar packet size. Multiple linear regression expressions are also presented for the prediction of the effects of grain/packet size, lamellar volume fraction and composition. The observed grain size dependence of mechanical properties is shown to be consistent with Hall-Petch exponents predicted for dislocation/dislocation and dislocation/grain boundary interactions in duplex <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> alloys. The implications of the empirical relationships are assessed for the engineering of balanced mechanical properties in gamma titanium aluminides.

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT DEFORMATION IN GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> <I>S.H. Whang</I>, Z.M. Wang, Q. Feng, C. Wei, Polytechnic University, Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201
<P>
Deformation of gamma titanium aluminides may be best described by the lack of sufficient ductility at RT as well as intermediate temperatures, and the anomalous yielding at high temperatures. Such deformation behavior is mainly attributed to unusual behavior of two independent slip systems: superdislocation slip and ordinary dislocation slip, both of which simultaneously operate over the entire temperature range in the polycrystalline alloys. For this reason, the study on the role of individual slip system is required to carry out deformation experiments with single crystals of a <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloy. In <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-56Al, the yield stress curves of superdislocation slip show positive temperature dependence over two distinct temperature regimes while those for ordinary dislocation slip exhibit a single temperature range. These distinct temperature regimes can be explained with the characteristic features of the dislocation structures which were obtained from the postmortem examinations of the deformed specimens conducted by TEM. The thermodynamic aspects of both cross-slip configurations of superdislocations will be presented based on anisotropy strain energy calculations. Finally, the CRSS values depend on deformation orientation in superdislocation slip, in consistent with the cross-slip models. The details of the orientation dependence will be discussed.

PLASTIC INSTABILITIES IN <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl AND THEIR RELATION TO WORK HARDENING AND TOUGHNESS:</B> <I>Fran&ccedil;ois Louchet</I>, Groupe Physique du Metal, LTPCM- UMR.CNRS/INPG/UJF, B.P. 75, Domaine Universitaire, 38402 - St Martin d'H'eres, France
<P>
Flow stress anomaly in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl is associated, as in many other intermetallics, to a strain rate sensitivity (SRS) close to zero, to plastic instabilities, and to a high work hardening rate (WHR). In situ TEM observations also show a jerky motion of groups of cusped ordinary screw dislocations (1), in agreement with macroscopic instabilities. The present paper investigates these instabilities in the framework of the Local Pinning Unzipping (LPU) model (2), in which the flow stress anomaly and the low value of the SRS are predicted as a consequence of a balance between dislocation exhaustion and multiplication rates. This balance is applied here to groups of N dislocations, and results in a non linear equation in N, from which the minimum stress required to deform the material at a given strain rate can be determined. The corresponding average value of N is obtained as a function of temperature. The consequences of the temperature dependence of N on both WHR and toughness are discussed. Possible consequences on the particular dramatic brittleness of PST materials loaded perpendicular to lamellar boundaries (3), in which slip in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl takes place across lamellae, can also be contemplated as a function of these instabilities, and particularly in terms of the variations with temperature of the number N of dislocations in pile-ups.

MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF 1/2&lt;110] UNIT DISLOCATIONS IN <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif"> AND (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha-bold.gif">2 +<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">) TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>Sriram Seshagiri</I>, SYSTRAN Corporation, 4126, Linden Ave., Dayton, OH 45432; Dennis M. Dimiduk, Materials Directorate, WL/MLLM, WPAFB, OH 45433; Vijay K. Vasudevan, Dept. of Materials Sci. &amp; Eng., Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221
<P>
The <B>b</B>=1/2&lt;110] unit dislocations are a dominant part of the deformation substructure in both single phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) and two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) TiAl alloys, at ambient temperatures and above. These dislocations have been characterized in a coarse-grained (~300 mm) single-phase binary TiAl alloy. The results show that these dislocations undergo double cross-slip, resulting in numerous pinning points (jogs) and mixed character dislocation segments bowed about these pinning points, giving rise to a cusped morphology. The linear pinning-point density in single-phase alloys increases with deformation temperature from ~2-5 mm-1 at RT, to ~10 mm-1 at higher temperatures, with an attendant increase in the yield strength of the alloy. In two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) fully-lamellar polycrystals and PST crystals the, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> lamellae thicknesses are typically ~1mm, which is approximately the same order as the free-segment length of the unit dislocations in the single-phase alloys. Hence, the morphological evolution of 1/2&lt;110] unit dislocations in the fully lamellar material, wherein deformation propagation is constrained by the lamellae dimensions, is of particular interest. Transmission electron microscopy observations pertaining to these aspects, and their implications on strength and plasticity, will be discussed in the presentation.

TENSILE/COMPRESSIVE PROPERTIES OF SINGLE CRYSTAL GAMMA Ti-55.5%Al ALLOY:</B> <I>Marc Zupan</I>, Kevin J. Hemker, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218
<P>
Understanding of the deformation mechanisms that lead to the flow strength anomaly of Ni3Al has been greatly enhanced by the measurement of the orientation dependence of flow stress and tension/compression asymmetry. To date, lack of high quality single crystals sufficiently large to facilitate mechanical testing have precluded such studies of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl. High quality single crystals of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti(55.5%)Al have been grown using an optical float zone furnace, which provides a containerless growing environment. These crystals have been oriented and cut into microsample tension/compression specimens with a gage area of 250 mm x 250 mm and effective gage length of 300 mm. These specimens have been deformed using a microsample testing machine which applies loads on the order of 1 lb. and strain using an interferometric strain gage. Stress-strain curves will be reported for a variety of orientations, temperatures and as a function of the sense of applied load. Experimental results will be discussed within the current context of current dislocation theories.

FATIGUE AND FRACTURE OF TiAl PST CRYSTALS:</B> <I>Y. Umakoshi</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565 Japan
<P>
Orientation and temperature dependences of cyclic hardening, fatigue life and fracture mode of TiAl PST crystals were investigated. Deformation twins and vein-like structure containing high density of ordered dislocations were formed below 500&#176;C depending on the type of ordered domain in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase. The vein-like structure was responsible for strong cyclic hardening, while deformation twins were formed at the initial stage of fatigue and did not contribute the hardening. Formation of twins and vein-like structure was suppressed at 700&#176;C and fatigue life rapidly decreased showing cyclic softening. Deformation twins produced extrusions on the specimen surface and played an important role for crack initiation and fatigue failure. Effect of additional third elements such as V and Nb on the cyclic hardening and fatigue life will also be presented.

FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF FATIGUE FRACTURE IN TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>Kwai S. Chan</I>, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78238; D.S. Shih, McDonnel Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, MO 63166
<P>
The fatigue mechanisms in a TiAl alloy heat-treated to the lamellar and equiaxed microstructures were studied to determine the effects of microstructure on the initiation of microcracks and their subsequent growth into large cracks. The results indicated microcracks initiated at grain/colony boundaries and at slip bands. Most microcracks were arrested after nucleation, but a few grew at K below the large crack thresholds. The populations of non-propagating and propagating cracks varied with life fractions. Ligaments in the wake of a fatigue crack were prone to fatigue failure. The destruction of the crack-wake ligaments resulted in lower fracture resistance in materials under cyclic loading than those under monotonic loading. *Supported by the AFWL Materials Directorate through Contract No. F33615-92-C-5951.

MICROMECHANICS OF FATIGUE AND FRACTURE IN LAMELLAR TiAl:</B> <I>Bimal K. Kad</I>, Robert J. Asaro, Department of Applied Mechanics &amp; Engineering Science, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093
<P>
Finite element based numerical procedures, incorporating physically based crystal plasticity models, are employed to study the evolution of non-uniform deformation, under monotonic and fully reversed (R=-1) cyclic loadings, in lamellar TiAl microstructures. The impetus for such efforts is to gather fundamental insight into microstructure sensitive deformation mechanisms, and to extract additional information, not obtainable from traditional mechanical property measurements. Such an effort is particularly desirable to help track various aspects of plastic anisotropy of specific layers, and microconstituents as implicit in polycrystalline aggregates. Computational efforts are directed to address constant strain, as well as constant stress amplitude loading schemes in the low cycle fatigue regime. Irreversible deformation twinning effects are fully accounted for in the fatigue maximum of 100 cycles. We will present several examples of experimentally observed, and numerically computed results, to identify hot spots for strain localization in monotonic and fully reversed loadings, and prescribe microstructural remedies to alleviate such effects.

MICROCRACK NUCLEATION AND PROPAGATION IN TiAl:</B> <I>Zhe Jin</I>, George T. Gray III, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Microcrack nucleation and propagation in a PST-TiAl crystal and a duplex <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloy at high and quasi-static strain rates and temperatures from 196&#176;C to 1200&#176;C was investigated under compression loading. In PST crystals, two microcracking habit planes, the {110} planes for translamellar cracking and the (111) interface plane for interlamellar cracking, were observed when the &lt;110&gt; directions in the lamellar interfaces were perpendicular to the loading direction. However, three microcracking habit planes were observed when the &lt;321&gt; directions in the lamellar interfaces were perpendicular to the loading direction. Most microcracks were found to nucleate at/near the lamellar interfaces and propagate into the laths along their habit planes to form translamellar cracks. In the fine-grained duplex microstructure, both grain interior microcracks and grain boundary microcracks were observed. The grain interior microcracks occurred primarily within the equiaxed grains and appeared to be formed by shear displacements along the maximum shear planes. An attempt to correlate the microcrack formation with the crystal deformation modes and crystal orientations is made and the microcrack nucleation and propagation mechanisms in TiAl are analyzed.

DAMAGE MODELING OF GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> <I>M.J. Pfuff</I>, B.U. Wittkowsky, GKSS-Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH and SFB 371, Institut f&uuml;r Werkstofforschung, Max-Planck-Str., D-211502 Geesthacht, Germany
<P>
A common feature of Gamma Titanium Aluminides is the heterogeneous character of their microstructure. This heterogeneity causes failure processes to be progressive, with a continuous transition between a diffused and a localized mode of damage, the relative contribution of both modes to failure being determined by the degree of randomness of microstructural heterogeneity. At room temperature the failure is preceded by the formation of microcracks which control the strain to failure either by microcrack coalescing or by the nucleation of a critical-size crack. The size and local distributions of microcracks reflect the heterogeneity of microstructure, and depend on stress state, size and geometry of the specimens. The results of model calculations are presented, which are based on mesoscale lattice of beams models used in statistical physics in order to treat the relationships between microcracking and failure. A comparison of the numerical results to the experimental findings emphasizes the significant role microstructural heterogeneity plays during the failure process of Titanium Aluminides.

LARGE-SCALE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL FRACTURE IN A <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl ALLOY:</B> <I>S.J. Zhou</I>, D.M. Beazley, P.S. Lomdahl, B.L. Holian, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
We have carried out new large-scale molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of fracture in a titanium-aluminum alloy, using the methods we developed in previous MD simulations, where we studied dislocation emission from a crack in a three-dimensional thin film of embedded- atom-method copper, comprising 35 million atoms. In that first study, we observed a variety of dislocation emission modes in a sample that was sufficiently thick that we could be sure that the results did not depend on the thickness. The sequence of dislocation emission in the crack blunting process strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of the crack front and differs strikingly from anything previously conjectured. This finding is essential to establish a precise dislocation emission criterion (i.e. intrinsic ductility criterion). We will report on similar calculations for the TiAl system, with emphasis on the crack-tip plasticity and interaction between a crack and lamellar interfaces.

ATOMISTIC SIMULATIONS OF FRACTURE IN TiAl:</B> <I>Julia Panova</I>, Diana Farkas, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA 24061
<P>
Atomistic simulations of fracture in L1o TiAl were carried out using EAM interatomic potentials and molecular statics. We studied the behaviour of semi-infinite cracks under mode I loading in different crack-tip orientations. From the [1-10](111) crack tips we observed extensive dislocation emission, involving the formation of several planar faults, such as APB, CSF and SISF. We found that the edge dislocations with 1/2[110] Burgers vector that were emitted from [001](110) cracks were very compact and mobile. No planar fault formation was involved in the dislocation emission from this crack geometry. Cracks with [001](100) orientation were observed to cleave near the Griffith value of loading in a purely brittle manner.

ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MECHANISMS OF PLASTICITY AND FRACTURE IN Ti-48 AT.% Al ALLOYS</B>: <I>J.M.K. Wiezorek</I>, P.M. DeLuca, M.J. Mills, H.L. Fraser, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The technologically most relevant two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) TiAl compounds contain a significant volume fraction of morphologically lamellar grains. Interestingly, a change in the predominant fracture mode has been observed from transgranular at room temperature to intergranular at elevated temperature for both equiaxed and duplex microstructures. It has previously been suggested that the segregation of alloying additions and/or impurities to grain boundaries during exposure at elevated temperature could be responsible for this change in fracture characteristics. However, the origin for the observed fracture mode change has not been ascertained to date. In this study binary Ti48at.%Al alloys of equiaxed, duplex and fully lamellar microstructure have been deformed in tension to various degrees of strain up to fracture, at both room and elevated temperature. The active fracture modes have been identified by SEM fractography. Moreover, the deformation modes active in these two phase TiAl compounds during tensile loading have been determined by TEM. Thin foils for the TEM characterization have been obtained from cuts perpendicular and parallel to the load axis at various locations in the gage sections as close as 10 &#181;m from the actual fracture surface. The results of these investigations are discussed specifically with respect to the origin of the reported fracture mode changes, and the mechanisms fundamentally underlying the plasticity and fracture of these (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) TiAl compounds.

FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF GRAIN BOUNDARY CAVITATION IN FULLY LAMELLAR TITANIUM ALUMINIDE INTERMETALLIC ALLOY:</B> <I>Anirban Chakrabort, </I>James C. Earthman, Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Irvine CA 92697
<P>
Creep constrained grain boundary cavitation in fully lamellar form of titanium aluminide intermetallic alloy has been studied using finite element techniques. Two different forms of fully lamellar models are considered. Cavitation is modeled in the presence of grain boundary sliding for the case of straight former grain boundaries and cavitation without grain boundary sliding is considered for fully lamellar microstructure with serrated former grain boundaries. Effect of interaction of cavitating facets on rupture life has been studied. A comparison between the fully lamellar forms and a dual phase equiaxed microstructure having the same phase ratio (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) is also made to examine the relative susceptibility of these microstructures to high temperature damage.

REDUCTION OF PRIMARY CREEP IN TiAl ALLOYS BY PRESTRAINING:</B> <I>Jian N. Wang</I>, L.M. Hsiung, T.G. Nieh, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, L-370, P.O. Box 808, Livermore, CA 94551-9900<P>
In some engineering applications, TiAl components are limited to undergo less than 0.3-0.5% creep distortion. However, existing fully lamellar TiAl alloys deform to this strain within a short period of time during primary creep. Thus, the reduction of primary creep has become a key issue. Present experiments show that this creep can be significantly reduced by prestraining. A sample prestrained at a high stress could undergo no forward deformation at a subsequent low stress even after a long period of time. Microstructural examination indicates that the motion of misfit dislocations along interfacial and thermal twin boundaries is the dominant mode of deformation at low stress. The mobility of these dislocations after prestraining and the physical origin of this effect will be discussed.

CHANGES IN MICROSTRUCTURE DURING PRIMARY CREEP IN A Ti-47Al-2Nb-1Mn-0.5W-0.5Mo-0.2Si ALLOY:</B> <I>D.Y. Seo</I>, T.R. Bieler, Department of Materials Science and Mechanics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1226; D.E. Larsen, Howmet Corporation, Whitehall, MI 49461<P>
Cast gamma titanium aluminides are gaining acceptance as potential replacements for superalloy and steel components in many applications. One particular alloy with W, Mo and Si additions has shown exceptional primary creep resistance. Quantitative microscopic comparisons were made between microstructures in the grip sections and the deformed gage section in creep specimens deformed to 0.5% strain, using optical, SEM and TEM techniques. The lamellar spacing in lamellar grains systematically decreased after creep deformation. Precipitates containing refractory elements nucleated and grew at a faster rate in the deformed part of the specimen, as compared to the deformed region, and the precipitates were generally smaller and more homogeneously nucleated. Precipitates have been identified to be silicides or beta phase. These observations indicate that strain assisted nucleation of precipitates accounts for much of the excellent creep resistance.

EVOLUTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE DURING THE ELEVATED TEMPERATURE CREEP OF SINGLE-PHASE GAMMA Ti47Al51Mn2 ALLOY:</B> <I>Min Lu,</I> Kevin J. Hemker, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218
<P>
Mechanical experiments have shown that single-phase gamma TiAl does not exhibit steady-state creep. Instead, the microstructure evolves along the creep curves. To investigate microstructure/property relations, constant stress creep tests on single-phase polycrystalline gamma Ti47Al51Mn2 were conducted at temperatures below and above the peak temperature (600&#176;C). Primary creep, minimum strain rate regions and tertiary creep were investigated. Creep tests conducted at 550&#176;C, 550&#176;C and 700&#176;C were stopped at different stages and specimens were prepared for TEM observations. No evidence of the subgrain formation has been found in any of the creep tests. Faulted dipoles and superdislocations, as well as a few ordinary dislocations, were present in the microstructure of the early stage of the creep tests. At longer creep times, faulted dipoles were annihilated and superdislocations were found to form &quot;roof&quot; like barriers. TEM observations of faulted dipoles and superdislocations were correlated, where appropriate, with computer simulations. The density and the degree of bowing of the &quot;cusps&quot; on ordinary dislocations increased dramatically with increasing creep strain. The configuration of the &quot;cusps&quot; formed on the ordinary dislocations were studied with weak-beam TEM and were compared to those found in the yielding and the prestraining studies of the same alloy.

MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND CREEP DEFORMATION OF A MO-CONTAINING NEAR-GAMMA ALLOY:</B> <I>Eric Ott</I>, Tresa Pollack, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213<P>
The addition of Mo in near-gamma alloys promotes the formation of the beta phase. The presence of the beta phase stabilized by Mo as well as other alloy additions including Nb and Cr has been shown to result in good hot working characteristics. Microstructural evolution of a Ti-46.4Al-2Nb-2Cr-0.8Mo fine grained wrought alloy during annealing and subsequent heat treatment will be reported with a specific emphasis on the effects of the beta/B2 phases on the development of gamma and lamellar microstructures. Results of creep testing and subsequent microscopy of near-gamma and duplex microstructures will also be discussed and compared to that of a similar Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr type alloy containing no Mo.

CREEP DEFORMATION OF NEAR/FULLY LAMELLAR Ti-48Al-BASED ALLOYS:</B> <I>G.B. Viswanathan, </I>V.K. Vasudevan, Dept. of Mat. Sci. &amp;Eng., Univ. of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221<P>
In this study, the creep properties of the binary Ti-48Al and quarternary Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloys are investigated for the near and fully lamellar microstrutures in the temperature range of 700-815&#176;C and stress of 103-240 MPa. The creep behavior of all the tested microstructures is best described by the power law creep. Activation energy (Q) between 350-370 KJ/mole and stress exponent (n) in the range of 5.0-8.0 was obtained for the binary Ti-48Al alloy. The corresponding values for the Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy were ~315 KJ/mole and ~5.0. The effect of grain size and the lamellar spacing on the creep behavior is discussed. Defect analysis through weak beam dark field imaging was carried out to elucidate the dislocation mechanisms in the crept samples. Observations of the crept samples with the fully lamellar structure in the binary alloy indicate that both 1/2&lt;110] and 1/2&lt;112] dislocations are active, that the deformation is highly anisotropic and that the lamellar interfaces obstruct slip (depending on the orientation). The combination of low creep rates with a high stress exponent for the fully lamellar structures is thought to be caused by the combined effect of anisotropic deformation and lamellar boundaries obstructing slip; the dislocations that are piled up at the interfaces overcome these obstacles by local climb, which is reflected in the Q values near that of self-diffusion of Ti in TiAl. The formation of substructures within the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths and the lamellar interface structures before and after creep will be discussed.

DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF AN OXIDATION-RESISTANT COATING ALLOY FOR GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> <I>M.P. Brady</I>, W.J. Brindley, J.L. Smialek, MS 106-1, NASA Lewis, Cleveland, OH 44135<P>
A two-phase <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> (TiAl) + Laves (Ti[Cr,Al]2) oxidation-resistant coating alloy, Ti-51.25Al-12.25Cr at.%, has been developed for the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 class of titanium aluminides. The composition of the coating alloy was selected so that the microstructure consists of the g phase, and a minor volume fraction of the oxidation-resistant Laves phase. By basing the microstructure on the g phase, the mechanical properties and substrate compatibility are optimized. The volume fraction of the Laves phase is kept to a minimum because it is extremely brittle. The Ti-51.25Al-12.25Cr coating alloy was applied to the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> + <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 alloy, Ti- 48Al-2Cr-2Nb, by low pressure plasma spray (LPPS). Oxidation tests at 800&#176;C and 1000&#176;C in air indicated that the coating successfully protected the substrate from oxidation. The oxidation behavior and mechanical properties of the coating alloy will be discussed.

VERY LONG TERM OXIDATION OF Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb AT 704&#176;C IN AIR:</B> <I>I.E. Locci</I>, M.P. Brady, R.A. MacKay, J.W. Smith; MS106-5, NASA Lewis, Cleveland, OH 44135<P>
The alloy Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb was exposed from 500h to 9000h at 704&#176;C in air. A complex, mixed alumina/titania scale, rather than a protective alumina scale, was formed. After 9000h, this scale was approximately 15 microns thick. A continuous Ti-rich nitride layer was formed at the alloy/scale interface. The alloy ahead of this nitride layer was depleted in Ti and enriched in Al. Comparisons with the oxidation behavior of binary TiAl alloys, and implications of the scale microstructure for mechanical properties will be discussed.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON THE OXIDATION OF TiAl:</B> <I>R. Wheeler</I>, R. Banerjee, H.L. Fraser, Department of Mater. Sci. and Eng., Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210<P>
The high level of Al in TiAl based alloys does not always relate to slow oxidation kinetics. While protective alumina scales are formed during high temperature exposures in an oxygen environment, mixed Al2O3/TiO2 scales are formed when similar tests are conducted in air. In this latter case, the surface corrosion products form a complex layered structure which governs oxidation rates. In a Ti-48Al-2Cr (at.%) alloy oxidized in air at 800&#176;C for 1 hour, two distinct layered microstructures are observed. One is composed of an Al depleted underlayer and a mixed Al2O3/TiO2 outerlayer. The other is composed of the same depleted layer with a multicomponent, multilayered outerscale. This second microstructure is characteristic of a nitrogen effect found to be associated with increased oxidation kinetics. Detailed TEM analyses has been conducted to identify the reaction products present in the scale. The deduced reaction paths suggest a rate behavior based on both interfacial reactions and the inward and outward anion and cation diffusion.

EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN PRESSURE ON OXIDATION KINETICS OF V-4wt.% Cr-4wt% Ti AND V-5wt.% Ti ALLOYS:</B> M. Uz, Chemical Engineering Department, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042; K. Natesan, Energy Technology Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439; <I>N. Barbosa III</I>, Chemical Engineering Department, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042<P>
We conducted comparative investigation to determine the effects of temperature and oxygen pressure on the oxidation behavior and microstructure of V-4wt.% Cr-4wt.% Ti and V-5wt.% Cr-5wt.% Ti Alloys. The samples were cut from 1-mm-thick cold-rolled sheet stock and annealed at 1050&#176;C for 1 h before their use in oxidation studies. The oxidation experiments were performed at oxygen pressures of 760, 0.1, 5x10-4, and 5x10-6 torr and at temperatures of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif">350 to 700&#176;C. Oxidation models, oxide type and thickness, partitioning of oxygen between oxide and substrate alloy, and alloy grain size were determined as a function of temperature and oxygen pressure. The results for the two alloys are discussed and compared with one another and with those from similar studies on unalloyed V reported in the literature.

OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF Al3Ti INTERMETALLICS:</B> R.G. Reddy, X. Wen, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487<P>
The oxidation kinetics of Al3Ti intermetallics have been studied at the temperature range of 1123K to 1273K in pure dry oxygen. The oxygen diffusion rates were investigated using TGA method. Parabolic rate constants were calculated and compared with other research results. The oxidation scales were analyzed using SEM, EDS and X-ray diffraction. A continuous Al203 scales with a little Ti02 (rutile) were formed on the intermetallic surface. The Al3Ti intermetallic exhibited excellent oxidation resistance among the Ti-Al base intermetallics.

SUPERHEATING BEHAVIOR OF NiAl:</B> <I> N. Kullcarni</I>, Dept. of Materials Science &amp; Eng., University of Florida, 245 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, Fl-32611; K.T. Hong, Division of Metals, Korea Inst. of Science &amp; Tech (KIST), 39-1 Hawolkog-dong, Sungbook-Gu, Seoul, Korea 136-791<P>
The intermetallic compound NiAl, when processed in a microgravity environment under electromagnetic levitation, exhibited a unique superheating effect up to 65 degrees over the melting point. This superheating behavior appeared to be related to the high supercoolings (200-250 degrees) experienced by molten NiA1 samples that rapidly solidified in the rnicrogravity levitation environment. The superheating observed appeared to be permanent and reduced asymmetrically for compositions that deviated from stoichiometry. On reaching the maximum or critical superheating temperature, an anomalous transformation occurred that caused the temperature of the sample to drop to its melting point, after which melting commenced. It appears that this transformation is an order-disorder type, that is explicitly associated with the superheating behavior in NiAl.

A STUDY OF POTENIAL EUTECTIC BRAZE ALLOYS IN THE Au-Ag-Ge TERNARY SYSTEM: </B> P.T. Vianco, <I>J.J. Stephens</I>, C.A. Walker, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0367<P>
Despite the need for low vapor pressure alloys with brazing temperatures in the 400-600&#176;C range, there are in fact very few commercially available alloys to use in this range. This study was motivated by the need to develop a brazing process with a maximum allowable brazing temperature of 500&#176;C. A survey of ternary phase diagrams, combined with previous experience with the binary 88wt.% Au-12 Ge alloy, led us to select the Au-Ag-Ge ternary system for further study. We have found that the 77.32 wt.% Au-12.62 Ag-10.06 Ge composition is a eutectic alloy with a eutectic temperature of ~447&#176;C. Hermetic seals to metallized alumina tensile buttons (ASTM F19 design) have been obtained with this system. This talk will present results braze joints strength results, along with a discussion of the as-solidified microstructure of this alloy. This work conducted at Sandia National Laboratories, supported by U.S. Dept. of Energy under contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.

DIFFUSION IN SILICIDES OF Mo AND W:</B> P.C. Tortorici, M.A. Dayananda, Purdue University, School of Materials Engineering, 1289 MSEE Building, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1289<P>
Diffusion studies were carried out with Si in contact with Mo and W at selected temperatures between 900&#176;C and 1350&#176;C for the formation and growth of silicides of Mo and W. Interdiffusion between MoSi2 and Mo and between MoSi2 and W was also studied for the development of silicide layers, such as MO5Si3, MO3Si, (Mo,W)5Si3, W5Si3 and nonplanar interface morphologies. Integrated interdiffusion coefficients calculated for the various silicide layers from concentration profiles are presented. The relative diffusion behavior of Si, Mo and W in selected silicide layers will be discussed in the light of diffusion structures and marker motion.

A technique for cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) sample preparation of mutt-layered and difficult materials as described. A focused ion beam (FIB) device is used to slice an electron transparent specimen from an area of interest. Micromanipulation procedures are then used to transport the electron transparent specimen from the bulk sample to a formvar/carbon coated copper grid for subsequent TEM analysis. The versatility of this technique is demonstrated by presenting cross-sectioned TEM specimens from a wide range of materials. TEM specimens that have been produced with the FIB method include a multi-layered thin film electronic device, a metallic diffusion couple, and a ceramic fiber.

<P>USE OF PVC AS A CHLORINATING AGENT IN THE RECYCLING OF METALS: </B>F. Tailoka, <I>D.J. Fray</I>, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom
<P>
The standard free energy of formation of the oxides of the ferrous metals is generally more negative than that for the chlorides whilst the reverse is true for the equivalent compounds of the non-ferrous metals. As a source of chlorinating agent PVC has been used. PVC has the nominal formula C2H2HCI. On combustion in air, considerable heat is generated and hydrogen chloride, water vapor and carbon dioxide are evolved. It can be regarded as a free source of heat and a chlorinating agent if scrap PVC is used. In this work, this gas has successfully been used to separate zinc, lead and copper from residues such as Jarosite, EAF dust and waste materials containing copper. Dioxins were not detected either in the residues or the condensed chlorides.

RECOVERING MAGNESIUM FROM SOAPSTONE AND ASBESTOS TAILINGS:</B> <I>V.A. Le&atilde;o</I>, C.A. Silva, M.G. Menenzes, J.C. Pires, L.G. Macedo, School of Mines, Federal University of Ouro Preto, Praca Tiradentes, 20; Ouro Preto, MG, 35400-000, Brazil
<P>
Asbestos industry produces large amounts of serpentine (magnesium silicate) tailings. The effect of this on human health is well-known. Besides this, the processing of a Brazilian rock known as &quot;Pedra sab&atilde;o&quot; (soap stone) generates powders that are discharged in the environment. This material is also a potential resource of magnesium. Magnesium oxide is used in many industries like refractory, waste water treatment, among others. The applicability of hydrochloric leaching for the recuperation of magnesium oxide from those materials has been investigated. The effect of time, temperature, particle size and solid/liquid ratio, on the leaching of magnesium and impurities, is discussed.

<P>
<P>Electronic components have metals with important valor like Au, Ag and 
Cu. These metals have a high performance in electric conductance. The 
recycling of scrap, however is too difficult because we have the presence of other 
metals like Fe, Al, Zn, Sn, more ceramics and plastics, all together in 
electronic components. This work had for subject define one way for physical 
separation. We have researched methods that obtained metallic concentrates 
non-ferrous. By the way we have used three types of scrap. We have used 
equipment of mineral processing. The metallic concentration make more easy 
the recuperation of metals because short the volume of material used. We

<P>
<P>A small-scale recycling unit for used beverage cans is designed, 
constructed and tested. The unit consists of a rotary kiln for delacquering, a 
gas-fired furnace crucible for melting, a baghouse for pollution control and an air 
recirculating system for heat recovery and oxygen control. The delacquering 
kiln utilizes a counter flow thermal decoating process and the optimized 
operating condition was found to be at 1000&#176;F, 6-7% 
O2 and a residence time of 15 minutes. In melting, a special salt mixture is made by combining cryolite 
and sodium chloride. The salt mixture has a low melting temperature 
(&lt;1250&#176;F) and is effective for demagging and degassing. The yield of the 
small-scale unit is about 90% and the energy efficiency matches those reported for 
large-scale facilities.

<P>OPTIMIZATION OF SALT COMPOSITION IN THE RECYCLING OF ALUMINUM CANS:</B> <I>Jorge Alberto Soares Tenorio</I>, Fabio Delgado, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, 05508-900, Sao Paulo, Brazil
<P>
During the melting processing of aluminum can scrap there is a considerable loss of metal due of metal trapping in the dross. Among all techniques available to recover this kind of scrap, the one using saline fluxes, based on NaCl / KCl equimolar composition and fluorides addition is outstanding. The investigation into the melting of AA3004 and AA5182 alloys (materials which the body and the lid of beverage cans are made of), the effect of delacquering, and the influence of different fluxes and the temperatures on the process yield are the main objectives of this work. Melting tests were carried out in order to access the effect of fluorides and the melting temperature on the recycling process yield. The fluoride efficiency for the temperature of 750&#176;C was: CaF2 &lt; NaF &lt; Na3AlF6 &lt; KF.

<P>RECYCLING OF MAGNESIUM ALLOY SCRAP, A NECESSITY:</B> Christine Brassard, <I>Lisabeth Riopelle, </I>Oddmund Wallevik, Hydro Magnesium Market Development Center, 21644 Melrose Avenue, Southfield, MT 48075-9705
<P>
<P>The use of magnesium alloys is growing rapidly, particularly in die cast parts for the automotive industry. Supporting this growth in the future means that Mg has to be an economically and ecologically attractive material, and recycling of alloy scrap becomes a necessity. What kinds of magnesium scrap will be on the market? What are the opportunities and challenges for this emerging recycling industry? Different recycling processes have been developed, and operation facilities are today recycling large volumes of class 1 diecast returns based on a flux refining technology. Characterization of the recovered metal demonstrates that the performance of appropriately recycled magnesium alloy is comparable to an alloy made from primary electrolytic metal. The sludge generated from this process can also be recycled through the existing primary Mg operations in order to close the environmental loop.

<P>
<P>The INMETCO Cadmium Recovery Facility currently processes commercial and industrial nickel/cadmium batteries at their Ellwood City, PA plant. The facility receives recycled nickel/cadmium batteries to recover cadmium shot product and nickel/iron scrap. The technology employed for the dismantling of industrial cells and the distillation of cadmium is under license from SAFT-NIFE in Sweden. In addition, INMETCO has installed a thermal pretreatment pilot unit for processing commercial and consumer cells which has recently demonstrated encouraging results. The INMETCO facility began detailed design in February 1995. The first cadmium distillation furnace was brought on-line December 1995, and the complete facility was operational April 1996. The facility can process 2450 short tons per year of industrial cells and 630 short tons per year of consumer cells. The facility design incorporated provisions for future expansion to allow INMETCO the ability to keep up with the forecasted growth of recycling nickel/cadmium batteries through the year 2000.

<P>
<P>Hitachi Refinery of Nippon Mining &amp; Metals Co., Ltd. installed a reverberatory type recycling furnace in 1978 in order to treat the industrial wastes which contain metal elements such as copper, gold and silver. Waste materials and pyrite such as galvanizing sludge, hydroxide slime and dust, are smelted together, and sulfidized copper, iron and precious metals are transformed into matte and other metallic elements are oxidized into slag. This copper matte is transported to Saganoseki smelter, and copper and precious metals are recovered. Recently it became difficult to get pyrite economically because of the decrease of pyrite production. Therefore, new treating process of the liquid waste has been investigated at Hitachi. In this process, the sulfide or sulfate from the liquid waste are smelted as the sulfur source instead of pyrite.

<P>AUTOMATIC SORTING OF ALUMINUM PACKAGINGS FROM DOMESTIC REFUSE:</B> <I>G.J. Nijhof</I> ea., Hoogovens R&amp;D, P.O. Box 10.000, 19709 CA IJmuiden, The Netherlands
<P>
<P>This work is part of a major European research project on the re-use of packaging materials in their post consumer state. The first stage of the recovering of aluminum from a waste stream is to free the non-ferrous metals with an Eddy Current machine. Previous research has given excellent results on the separation of aluminum from pre-separated packaging material. At this moment there were two reasons for a new test series: In the Netherlands all cities are obliged to collect the organic waste separately from the other waste, thus leading to a rest fraction with a high potential on aluminum. The newest generation Eddy Currents work with a higher separation efficiency. This report will discuss the results of these test series. The recovered aluminum is used for remelting trials in another sub-project of this research programme.

<P>PILOT SCALE INVESTIGATION OF FLEXIBLE ALUMINUM PACKAGING BY THERMAL PRETREATMENT:</B><I> H. Rossel, </I>R. Pietruck, VAW aluminum AG, Research &amp; Development, Georg-von-Bosselager-Strabe 25, 53117 Bonn, Germany; Y. Bertaud, Y. Caratini, Pechiney CRV, Vorreppe, France
<P>
<P>Laminates with aluminum are typically combined with other materials like plastics, paper, etc. The aluminum content is considerably below 50%. Therefore the separation of the laminate partner by a thermal procedure before the melting process is a successful solution. The paper reports the practical experiences with a pilot equipment in the 100kg-scale. Additionally the numerical approach to simulate the thermal process is presented. This work is part of a major European research project (PACK-EE) on the re-use of packaging materials in their post consumer state. Preliminary information on this project can be found in Light Metals, 1996.

<P>REMELTING AND PURIFICATION OF ALUMINUM PACKAGING WASTE: </B><I>G.H. Nijhof</I> ea., Hoogovens R&amp;D, P.O. Box 10.000, 1970 CA IJmuiden, The Netherlands
<P>
<P>This work is part of a major European research project on the re-use of packaging materials in their post consumer state. Recovering aluminum from household refuse leads to a mix-up with other metals, e.g. copper and steel. The aluminum industry aims to make packaging materials from waste packagings. Therefore, a purification step is required during the remelting operation. This research is focused on the removal of excess iron from the melt. The technique used is the formation of intermetallic compounds of FeMn by adding Mn, followed by separating these intermetallics from the molten metal. Theoretical studies of the ternairy and quarternairy phase diagrams, using computer modeling, have predicted the possible limits of purification. After laboratory trials some large scale remelting experiments have been performed to study the applicability of this technique.

<P>MINE GEOLOGY AND PROCESS ORE CONTROL AT NEWMONT MINES, CARLIN, NV:</B> <I>Joseph C. Rota</I>, Newmont Exploration Ltd., 1700 Lincoln Street, Denver, CO 80203
<P>
The Carlin Trend, located in NE Nevada, has produced over 17 million ounces of gold from Newmont's open pit and underground operations since 1965. Oxidized portions of sediment-hosted disseminated submicron-sized native gold is mostly amenable to dump or heap leaching, yielding 50 to 70% recovery of contained gold. Metallurgical control and grade of heap leach ores are maintained by geological techniques and standard assays. Mine geologists provide field observation and mineralogic data by daily visual blasthole logging. Refractory components are separated from oxide to ensure high recovery. Geologic and assay data are combined to create mine polygons in an engineering computer database. Mining selectivity is thus enhanced by ore control geologists who make production decisions based on direct mineralogic observations at active mine faces.

<P>BASIC CONCEPTS OF OXIDE GOLD DEPOSITS AND EXPLORATION STRATEGY: </B><I>E. Daniel Baker,</I> Senior Mineralogist, Newmont Metallurgical Services, 417 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 841O8 
<P>
The term <I>oxide gold </I>deposits, refers to gold-bearing veins, faults, and shear zones that typically contain appreciable amounts of oxidized ore or gossanous material, resulting from oxidation of sulfides. The concept of <I>oxide</I> <I>gold </I>deposits underwent a dramatic change after the discovery of the Carlin gold mine in north central Nevada in early 196O's, and now implies large tonnage, low-grade bulk minable deposits that are processed by milling and/or heap leach methods. <I>Oxide gold </I>deposits may be classified into two types: (1)<B> primary oxide</B> ores derived directly from the effects of hydrothermal alteration on oxidized host rocks, and (2) <B>secondary oxide</B> ores derived from the epigenetic effects of circulating post mineral fluids oxidizing gold-bearing sulfides. Each type of oxide gold deposit has unique diagnostic mineralogic and metallurgical characteristics, that must be addressed in order to achieve a successful exploration strategy.

<P>BLUE STAR SUBDISTRICT ZONED ALTERATION AND GOLD MINERALIZATION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON MINE OPERATIONS, CARLIN TREND, EUREKA COUNTY, NV: </B><I>Cindy L. Williams,</I> Newmont Exploration Ltd., Carlin NV 89822
<P>
Blue Star subdistrict open-pit gold deposits include multiple mines with 1.194 million ounces reserve and past production totalling 3.144 million ounces. The deposits are characterized by zoned alteration, including: 1) silicified core with erratic gold grade; 2) adjacent mill-grade (&gt;0.04 oz/st) intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration; 3) enveloping heap-leach grades (0.006-0.04 oz/st) weaker sericite-kaolinite-quartz-pyrite alteration; 4) surrounding decarbonatized and intensely argillized waste and leach grade ore; 5) pervasively decarbonated waste; and 6) peripheral waste with local propylitic and weaker decarbonated alteration. Each alteration assemblage is characterized by distinct rock strength parameters that influences geotechnical pit slope design, as well as metallurgy and optimizing of drill/blast cycles. Alteration of barren assemblages extend hundreds of feet beyond orebodies.

GEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY RELATED TO HEAP LEACHING AT THE RAIN MINE, ELKO COUNTY, NV: </B><I>Dean G. Heite</I>, Newmont Exploration Ltd., Carlin NV 89822
<P>
Gold Mineralization at Rain is largely hosted by Mississippian Webb Formation consisting of interbedded siltstones and mudstones. The NW-striking SE-dipping Rain fault is a main feeder structure for the deposit. Five ore types based on XRD and visual rock chip logging were identified: <B>argillaceous</B> (&gt;30% clays); <B>siliceous </B>(&lt;20% barite; <B>siliceous-baritic </B>(20-40% barite); <B>baritic </B>(&gt;40% barite); and <B>calcareous </B>(major carbonate minerals). The Rain heap-leach pad was commissioned in 1988, and to date 10.3 million tons of ore averaging 0.023 oz/st have been treated. Recovery to date through December 95 is approximately 56% for a total 132,453 ounces of gold produced. Two major factors have contributed to low leach recoveries at Rain: 1) excess <B>argillaceous ore</B> than expected on the pad, mostly late in the mine life, and 2) about half of the heaps were run-of-mine ore with no agglomeration. Testwork on leach grade composites indicated recoveries near 69% for material crushed to minus 1 1/5&quot;.

<P>GEOLOGY OF THE TUSC GOLD DEPOSIT, EUREKA COUNTY, NV:</B> <I>Paul O. Malan</I> and Leroy Schutz, Newmont Exploration Ltd., Carlin NV 89822
<P>
The Tusc gold deposit, located 8 miles NW of Carlin, Nevada, along the Carlin trend, is one of several structurally controlled gold deposits associated with the Good Hope fault within the Maggie Creek Subdistrict. Mining commenced in 1994 with an oxide reserve of 780,000 ounces of gold averaging 0.039 opt Au. The Good Hope Fault forms the SW edge of the Schroeder Mountain uplift (Carlin Window) and juxtaposes carbonate rocks of the Roberts Mountains Formation against siliceous mudstone, chert and siltstone of the Rodeo Creek Unit. Submicroscopic gold is disseminated in the shear zones of the Good Hope fault system and in crosscutting northeast-striking, high-angle faults in the lower plate carbonates in the immediate hanging wall. Wallrock alteration includes argillization, decalcification, silicification, and alunite veining, supergene leaching and oxidation. Arsenic forms a strong halo around the ore and an antimony anomaly occurs in the upper part of the deposit.

<P>MULTI-METAL RECOVERABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES AND WHITTLE PIT OPTIMIZATION OF MILL AND HEAP LEACHABLE GRADE ORES AT THE MCCOY BLACK COVE MINE, NV:</B> <I>Songlin Zhang,</I> Mining Engineer, Echo Bay Minerals Company, McCoy/Cove Mine, #1 McCoy Mine Rd., Battle Mountain, NV 89820
<P>
The McCoy/Cove mine, located in Eureka-Battle Mountain trend of Nevada, is a gold and silver deposit. Case studies of recoverable reserve estimation for gold and silver were made using multiple indicator kriging and volume variance correction. The grade tonnage distributions of recoverable reserves were constructed and compared with the distributions defined by blast hole assays. Optimal pits were generated by Whittle 4D pit optimization package to analyze the impact of different processing recoveries at different economic cutoffs. The results were compared with ordinary kriging. The study indicates that the proposed method for multi-mineral recoverable reserve estimation is more accurate than kriging in terms of grade and tonnage. The method of using recoverable reserves for pit optimization will maximize global reserve recovery and revenue, and is more efficient than condition simulation regarding computing power.

<P>OPERATION OF NEWMONT'S BIOOXIDATION DEMONSTRATION PLANT AND PRODUCTION OF GOLD FROM LOWER GRADE REFRACTORY ORES: </B>R.M. Perry, F.-P. Sawyer, <I>A.J. Schindler,</I> M.I.

<P>
<P>Test work on biooxidation pretreatment of low grade refractory gold has been ongoing at Newmont Gold Company since 1988, including laboratory testing and pilot biooxidation heaps (400 to 25,000 st). Metallurgical results of an oxidation process utilizing Thiobacillus ferroxidans have culminated in the design, construction and operation of a 780,000 ton bioxidation demonstration facility. The facility has processed 780,000 tons of refractory ore, using a batched process with separate pads for bioxidation and ammonium thiosulfate gold extraction. Siliceous sulfide refractory (SSR) and carbonaceous (CSR) ores are treated separately during biooxidation pretreatment unit operation. Procedures and results of grinding, agglomeration and pad biooxidation cycle (180 days) are followed by lime neutralization, and dumped on oxide leach pads, or stacked on the ammonium thiosulfate leach pad. Gold is leached with either cyanide for SSR ores or ammonium thiosulfate for preg-robbing CSR ores.

BIOLEACHING AND PROCESSING OF A REFRACTORY GOLD ORE:</B> <I>N.S. Lynn</I>, Lyntek, Inc., 775 Mariposa Street, Denver, CO 80204
<P>
A new process has been developed to bioleach refractory gold ores to expose the precious metal values using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacteria. The ore is hosted in a limestone rock with secondary replacement of carbonaceous and pyritic minerals. Crushing, stacking, bioleaching, rinsing and neutralization have been completed in a 45-day total time cycle. The use of sulfuric acid operation, and concentrated Thiobacillus ferroxidans population allows the short bioleaching cycle. The ore is then processed using conventional carbon-in-leach cyanide recovery techniques.

OXYGEN DIFFUSION INTO WET ORE HEAPS IMPEDED BY WATER VAPOR UPFLOW:</B> R.W. Bartlett, <I>K.A. Prisbrey</I>, Univ. of Idaho, College of Mines and Earth Resources, Moscow, ID 83844-3025
<P>
Natural bioxidation of shallow, refractory ore heaps, relying on gaseous oxygen diffusion from the heap surface is attractive because of its simplicity and potential low cost, especially without using a lined pad, which is possible if percolation of leachate through the heap is avoided. In this case, the excess oxidation enthalpy must be removed by water evaporation from within the wet ore heap, and the rising water vapor flux within it will impede the downward oxygen flux. An analysis of this process shows that for typical values of pyrite grades and limited temperature increases. In the ore heap, the oxidation rate and penetration into the heap is reduced to values between about 30 percent and 50 percent of those obtained when leachate percolation occurs and water evaporation is not significant mechanism of heat removal.

ECONOMIC CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING BIOHEAP PRETREATMENT OF MIXED OXIDE/REFRACTORY GOLD ORE:</B> <I>Robert W. Bartlett</I>, Univ. of Idaho, College of Mines &amp; Earth Resources, Moscow, ID 83844-3O25
<P>
Bioheap pretreatment of sulfidic refractory gold ore prior to cyanide leaching is a promising new technology, especially for low-grade ores that cannot be oxidized by pressure leaching or roasting.<B> </B>Ores containing both refractory and amenable gold require economic decisions whether, or not, to pretreat before cyanide leaching. This choice is more complex than familiar ore/waste cut-off grade decisions. Pretreatment may increase recovery but delays receiving revenue. An equation has been developed that computes a &quot;critical cyanide leachable gold grade&quot; for determining whether pretreatment will be profitable. If the ore's actual cyanide leachable grade, without pretreatment, is above critical grade, pretreatment will not pay. The parameters in this equation are: waste/ore cut-off grade, pretreatment yield, total gold grade, pretreatment operating cost and project's financial discount rate. Calculations are provided for use in mine development planning when bioheap pretreatment is an available option.

TEXTURES OF GOLD MINERAL PHASES RELATED TO HEAP LEACHING: </B> William Petruk, Consultant, Former Chief Mineralogist, CANMET, Ottawa, Canada K1A OG1<P>
Native gold and electrum are the main gold minerals recovered by heap leaching. Recovery depends on ore textures that influence exposure during crushing and grinding in preparation for heap leaching. Textures include gold-bearing veinlets along fractures and microfractures, and gold occurrences along grain boundaries. Small encapsulated gold grains in quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite are not likely exposed, and generally non-recoverable. Similar submicroscopic forms of gold are not recoverable by heap leaching. Detailed studies have shown that many so-called encapsulated gold grains may occur either along weakly bonded grain boundaries or microfracture in minerals, which become exposed by fine grinding. Ore textures in various ores will be reviewed. Ore types include gold in arsenopyrite-pyrite-quartz veins, gold-chalcopyrite deposits, disseminated gold in sediments, Carlin-type gold ores, gold-pyrite associations, and gold in volcanogenic ores, etc.

MINERALOGIC EVALUATION OF UNLEACHED GOLD IN BIOOXIDIZED LEACH RESIDUES: </B> <I> S.K. Chryssoulis,</I> AMTEL, London, Ontario, Canada N6G 4X6; Rong Yu Wan, Newmont Metallurgical Services, Salt Lake City, UT 841O8<P>
Gold associations were established in a biooxidized, chlorinated CIL<B> </B> residue assaying 0.02 oz Au/t and in a biooxidized thiosulfate leach residue assaying 0.01 oz Au/t. Detailed Mineralogic study involved: assays of screened fractions; light microscopy; ion probe microanalysis to quantify 'invisible' gold in sulfide minerals; proton probe microanalysis to detect submicroscopic gold in chert; and laser microprobe analysis to detect and quantify preg-robbed gold. In the CIL residue most of the gold is preg-robbed (71%). In the thiosulfate leach residue, gold occurs mainly as submicroscopic disseminations in microcrystalline quartz (chert). In both residues the 'invisible' gold in pyrite accounts for a minor fraction of the gold assay. Quantitative determination of the gold occurrence in the two residue samples established conclusively that gold adsorption on carbonaceous matter in the thiosulfate leach is of minor importance. <P>

This paper addresses processing options for recovering gold from carbonaceous sulfidic gold ores. These include, but not limited to, the following methods: (1) Hypochlorite pretreatment followed by cyanidization; (2) Chemical blanking agents pretreatment followed by cyanidization; (3) Non-cyanide heap leaching techniques; (4)Biological pretreatment followed by cyanidization; (5) Biological pretreatment followed by non cyanide heap leaching. Issues of costs, economics, recoveries, testing methods, state of advancement etc., will be discussed in the paper.

GEOLOGY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF GOLD MINERALIZATION IN FOUR SIBERIAN GOLD DEPOSITS, RUSSIA:</B> A.D. Genkin, N.S. Bortnikov, Y.G. Safonov, IGEM, Russian Acad. of Sciences, Moscow, Russia; <I>L.J.

<P>
A multidisciplinary investigation (SIMS, EPMA, Mossbauer) was used to characterize gold in four Siberian mesothermal sulfide gold deposits: Olympiadnenskoe and Veduginskoe within the Enisei Mountain Range and Nezhdaninskoe and Sentachan in the Verchoyansk-Kolyma area. It was found that some of the mineralization is refractory in all four deposits, occurring in large part as &quot;invisible&quot; gold in arsenopyrite and a lesser amount in pyrite. The gold concentration and distribution vary considerably, both within and between grains of arsenopyrite, with implications for processing options, such as heap leaching.

AUGMENT X4 TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LAB TO FEASIBILITY; A CASE STUDY:</B> K.M. Schall, K.A. Brunk, <I>G.R. Maxwell</I>, Augment Technologies, Denver, CO 80235
<P>
Gold ores containing oxide copper incur significant cost penalties when leached with cyanide, because 4-5 moles of cyanide are consumed for each mole of leached copper. This equates to ~4 lbs of NaCN per lb of leached Cu. Total cost of excess NaCN consumption plus CN destruction can exceed $4.00 per ton of ore. AuGMENT Technologies has developed and demonstrated a new process that can: 1) economically recover 70-80% of cyanide fed to a mill; 2) produce salable copper cathodes; and 3) reduce the need for cyanide destruction facility. Standard resin processing and electrowinning equipment are used to recover the cyanide and produce copper cathodes. Steps have been taken to determine: 1) how to develop resin kinetics; 2) how the AuGMENT Process can be scaled up; 3) how much savings is incurred at mill site; and 4) how the novel 'electro-elution' circuit achieves efficient operation.

COPPER RECOVERY AND CYANIDE REGENERATION FROM CYANIDE SOLUTIONS: </B> <I>H. Soto </I>and F. Nava, Dept. Mines and Metallurgy, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec G1K 7P4<P>
A method has been developed to recover cyanide and copper from heap leach cyanide solutions containing copper complexes and thiocyanate. Copper is precipitated as copper thiocyanate or copper cyanide, depending on pH and concentrations of thiocyanate and cyanide in effluents. Precipitates assaying over 50% Cu show good dewatering qualities and separate readily from effluents by filtration. Solutions containing bulk of cyanide are oxidized with ozone to transform remaining thiocyanate to cyanide, resulting in purified cyanide solution that can be recycled. The pH of the effluent is lowered to optimize precipitation and oxidation, and then raised to regenerate the cyanide. Recoveries are in excess of 96% of Cu and CN. Efficiencies of oxidation are 85-90%. Economic evaluation indicates a profitable process for solutions containing more than about 250 ppm copper. A bleed of barren solutions from cyanocidic gold/copper ores could be treated economically by heap leaching, since CN consumed by Cu could be regenerated at no cost.

WINTER HEAP LEACHING AT PEGASUS GOLD'S BEAL MOUNTAIN MINE:</B>J.E. Micheletti, <I>T.J. Weitz</I>, Beal Mountain Mining, Inc., Anaconda, MT 59711
<P>
Pegasus Gold's Beal Mountain Mine is located near the Continental Divide, SW Montana. Conventional surface mining utilizes crushing, heap leaching, carbon absorption/desorption, electrowinning and refining to produce approximately 60,000 oz gold annually. A leach pad sits at 2,300 meters (7,500 ft) elevation. Winters are long and cold with average snow accumulations of 1-2 meters; temperatures fall below minus 40&#176;C and wind chill temperatures below 70&#176;C. The Beal Mountain staff has developed special tools and procedures for burying drip emitter lines, and managing the heap and process solutions to allow for uninterrupted gold recovery during the winter season. Management of water balance and spring runoff is critical to the operations' success, due to mountainous terrain, high precipitation and proximity to a fishery and elk herd.<B> </B>The mine has an extensive network of land application disposal (LAD) and stormwater control systems to assure environmental protection and regulatory compliance.

OVERCOMING CLIMATOLOGY LIMITATIONS ON HEAP LEACHING:</B> <I>J.J. Komadina,</I> Executive Vice President, Pikes Peak Mining Company, Victor, CO; R.R. Beebe, Consultant, Tucson, AZ 85751-2O48
<P>
Heap leaching of gold ores has enjoyed wide acceptance in the arid and semi-arid regions of the western U.S., Australia and South America. There are areas, however, where cold weather or excessive precipitation can limit the usefulness of heap leaching. Even in Nevada, difficulties can be encountered which call for special operating procedures. This paper discusses general climatological limitations and some of the techniques used to extend heap leaching into colder conditions. A case history of the Pikes Peak operation in Colorado examines &quot;Valley-fill&quot; technology as an ideal cold-climate solutions, where topographical conditions permit.

CYANIDE SOLUTION DETOXIFICATION JAR TESTS: </B><I>C.H. Bucknam</I>, Senior Coordinator, Newmont Metallurgical Services, Salt Lake City, UT 841O8
<P>
Environmental regulatory requirements for discharge of solutions and closure of operations for the gold mineral processing industry have been moving towards meeting USEPA inorganic drinking water standards. Use of jar tests for water treatment process development is suitable for preliminary scoping work, conducted in a research laboratory for optimization studies, and at the site of the water treatment. Experimental methods utilize standard jar test equipment in effort to produce solutions that meet standards for USEPA inorganic drinking water, after chemical treatment of cyanide solutions. The materials tested included gold-bearing pregnant solutions from heap leach operations, gold plant barren solutions from Merrill-Crowe zinc cementation gold recovery process and final gold heap-leach wash solutions after carbon-in-column recovery. Experiments include cyanide destruction with sodium hypochlorite, and arsenic co-precipitation coupled with mercury precipitation.

GREENSTONE RESOURCES LTD.--SANTA ROSA PROJECT:</B> <I>Randy Martin</I>, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Greenstone Resources Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5E 1S2
<P>
Greenstone Resources Ltd. constructed and operates the Santa Rosa open pit, heap leach gold mine in Veraguas, Panama. The project was commissioned in 1995 at a designed capacity of 1.8 million tons per year. The ore exhibits a long leach up to three years, and requires three stage crushing to minus 3/8 inch to achieve on average a 74% gold recovery. The crushing plant is required to handle high volumes of clay and the circuit includes a Barmac Crusher. Panama receives over 3 meters of rain annually and Greenstone is using innovative means to control the project's water balance. Greenstone has developed a successful approach to operating a low grade (1.5 gm Au/T) deposit under difficult operation conditions.

THE PLASTIC INFLUENCE AND ITS APPLICATION IN LEACHING PROCESSES FAVORING COST AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:</B> Juan B. Cabezas, J.B.C. (Minermat Inc.) Consultorks, Santiago, Chile
<P>
The favorable characteristics and workability of plastics as a replacement of wood, lead, stainless steel, asphalt and other materials are described. Various types of plastics have proven to be the most favorable choice for handling a variety of acidic, alkaline and organic solutions, as well as pulps, chemical wastes, slurries or tailings for impoundments. The material origin of various plastics, methods of manufacturing and specifications applied to leaching solutions are discussed, including availability and costs. Examples of select plastics are considered for use as alternatives of other materials under severe environmental requirements.

PROJECTING LABORATORY AND PILOT TEST DATA INTO OPERATING REALITY: </B><I>Robert R. Beebe,</I> Consultant, Former Vice President, Newmont Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 32048, Tucson, AZ 85751-2048
<P>
Laboratory and pilot-scale tests are almost invariably required before metallurgical development can proceed. Difficulties with sampling, as well as with classical chemical and physical scale-ups are normally anticipated and relatively well-understood, but more subjective factors also come into play, including misunderstandings of the operating scheme chosen, wrong &quot;lessons&quot; learned from similar operations, failures to handle data appropriately, and even arbitrary intervention by management. The paper examines some of these subjective factors and suggests ways to guard against them. Several anecdotal case studies are used as examples, including when and where to heap leach or to mill specific types of gold ore.

PREDICTING PRODUCTION HEAP LEACH CYCLE TIMES FROM LABORATORY COLUMN TEST DATA:</B> <I>Philip Thompson,</I> President, Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories, Inc., Murray UT 84157-0685
<P>
Carefully planned Laboratory test programs provide valuable data regarding the amenability of low grade gold ores to heap leaching. Several problems are encountered in laboratory column simulation of gold heap leaching. A problem most commonly associated with column testwork is the limit on test column height. Most laboratories use a 3 to 5 meters (or 9 to 15 feet) high column as a standard test due to building ceilings and sample size limitations, etc. The problem with this column height is that most commercial heaps are at least 10 to 15 meters (25-35 feet) high, with some heaps reaching 100-200 meters (225-450 feet). This paper presents a data interpretation method whereby the data from test columns of virtually any height can be used to predict a first approximation leach cycle time for commercial heaps. Other important factors, e.i. sample preparation protocol, preliminary bottle roll testing, column diameter requirements, and leach solution analysis, are also discussed.

AGGLOMERATION PRACTICE AT KENNECOTT BARNEYS CANYON MINING COMPANY, BARNEY CANYON, UT:</B> <I> Philip L. LeHoux</I>, Chief Metallurgist, Kennecott Barneys Canyon, Magna, UT 84O44
<P>
Kennecott Barneys Canyon Mining Company has been a gold heap leaching facility in operation since 1989. In 1994, a flotation plant was commissioned to remove sulfide minerals from refractory sulfide ore. Tailings from the plant are mixed with oxide heap leach material in order to produce a geotechnically stable agglomerate from which the gold is leached and recovered in a conventional heap leach cyanidation process. The experience to arrive at an effective blending methodology is discussed.

<P>
Zarafshan/Newmont is a 50/25/25 joint venture between Newmont Gold and two entities of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources, and Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat. Zarafshan/Newmont joint venture consists of a heap leaching operation, which will process 220 million metric tons of existing stockpiles of low-grade oxide ore averaging 0.036 oz Au/T from the Muruntau mine. Net recovery over the 17-year life of the project is expected to be 4.8 million ounces of gold. The plant started in October 1993, and the operations commenced on May 25, 1995. The crushing plant consists of four stages of crushing and screening to produce 95% -3.35 mm product followed by heap leaching and gold recovery by Merrill-Crowe process. The Dore metal is refined at the Muruntau refinery. All gold produced by the joint venture is sold on the world market.

PROCESS MINERALOGY OF HEAP LEACHABLE ORE DEPOSITS: </B><I>J.G. Davidson, </I>N.A. McKay, Lakefield Research Ltd., Lakefield, Ontario KOL 2HO
<P>
Heap leachable ore deposits from many countries have been submitted for process mineralogical evaluation and laboratory testwork. Numerous factors must be addressed and integrated by the mineralogist, geologist, metallurgist and engineer. Projects encompass grass roots exploration, preliminary petrographic analysis, predictive and process mineralogy, dye penetration analysis of rocks and thin sections, metallurgical beneficiation testwork and plant optimization studies. The significance of mineralogical factors, such as geological controls, degree of oxidation, dye amenability, liberation, deleterious minerals, refractoriness, and the impact of mineralogy on gold recovery and process considerations, will be presented.

COLD WEATHER HEAP LEACHING OPERATIONAL METHODS:</B> <I>Kenneth E. Smith</I>, Lyntek, Inc. 775 Mariposa St., Denver, CO 80204
<P>
Cold weather heap leaching can be grouped into two basic regions; Arctic and near-Arctic, with various operational techniques or combinations of operating techniques dictated by latitude and site topography. The basic cold weather regions are Arctic areas, (between 50( and 60( North latitude). As techniques and operational philosophy have advanced, heap leaching operations have moved into progressively colder regions.

HEAP LEACHING IN EXTREME NOTHERN CLIMATES, AN OVERVIEW OF THE BREWERY CREEK MINE, YUKON, CANADA:</B> Thomas Haper, Sitka Corporation; Rod Samuels, RM Samuels Consulting; Rupert Allen, Consulting Geologist, Viceroy Resources Corporation, Vancouver, B.C., Canada
<P>
Viceroy Resource Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., has recently developed and brought into production the Brewery Creek Mine, an open-pit heap leach gold mine, located 55km east of Dawson City in Yukon, Canada. Mineable reserves are 15.2 million tonnes of ore grading 1.45 grams/tonne, containing 22 tonnes (707, 315 oz) of gold. Ore processing employs the heap leach technology using run-of-mine ore. Highlights of 1996 activity included construction of a 158,000m2 of leach pad, placing 1.9 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 1.46 gpt to the leach pad, construction and successful commissioning of the ADR plant, and pouring of the first gold bar on November 15th. Permitting of this mine has drawn significant attention because of the innovated heap leach technology; although this technology has been proven in other jurisdictions, it has not been used at such northern sites where winter temperatures routinely reach -45(C for extended periods. Acknowledgments are extended to the staff of the Viceroy Resources Corporation for their participation in developing the successful heap leaching technology under extreme frigid climatic conditions.

<P>POWER APPLICATIONS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS:</B> <I>P. Haldar</I>, M.S. Walker, D.W. Hazelton, J.G. Hoehn, Jr., Intermagnetics General Corporation, Latham, NY 12208
<P>
Intermagnetics has concentrated on manufacturing long lengths of silver sheathed Bi-2223 and surface coated Bi-2212 HTS conductor. Development work has led to the successful manufacture of Bi-2223 multifilament conductor in lengths exceeding 1 km, with properties useful for most electric power applications. Surface coated, low cost, Bi-2212 conductor in lengths over 400 meters are now also being produced. Several lengths of high performance tapes have already been delivered to GE to wind the first HTS generator coil. The coils were successfully tested in a steady state, conduction cooled environment generating 40,000 amp-turns at 23.5 K. Novel and unique hybrid magnet designs are being designed and built with the availability of both Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 HTS conductors. The demonstration and test of a pre-prototype 1 MVA transformer utilizing HTS windings is planned in collaboration with ORNL, Waukesha Electric, and RG&amp;E. The development of the largest HTS coils is continuing, for the construction of a 15 KV fault current limiter as part of the DOE-SPI program with Lockheed Martin, Southern California Edison, and LANL. Several high amp-turn coils have also been fabricated and delivered to the U.S. Navy to demonstrate a high horse power HTS homopolar motor. These demonstrations indicate the rapid progress being made to develop commercial applications of high-temperature superconductors.

<P>CONTROLLED PRECIPITATION OF SECOND PHASES IN (Bi,Pb)2223 CERAMICS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE PINNING:</B> <I>P. Majewski</I>, S. Kaesche, A. Sotelo, F. Aldlinger, Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung, Pulvermetallurgisches Laboratorium, Heisenbergstr. 5, D-70569 Stuttgart<P>

Taking the temperature dependent Pb solubility of (Bi,Pb)2+xSr2Ca2Cu2O10+d [(Bi,Pb)2223] into account, it is possible to precipitate various second phases in single phase (Bi,Pb)2223 ceramics at temperatures below 840&#176;C, i.e., Pb4Sr5CuO10, Ca2CuO3, CuO and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212). At 800&#176;C, the kinetic of the formation is fast resulting in mm-sized second phase precipitates after about 6 h. The Jc of the samples increases with precipitation, indicating increased pinning properties of the ceramics. After a maximum increase of Jc at about 3 h, Jc decreases again.

EFFECT OF LEAD CONTENT ON PHASE EVOLUTION AND MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN Ag-CLAD Bi-2223 COMPOSITE CONDUCTORS: </B><I>N.N. Merchant</I>, V.A. Maroni, A.K. Fischer, S.E. Dorris, W. Zhong, N. Ashcom, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
Silver-sheathed monofilamentary Bi1.8PbxSr1.98Ca1.97Cu3.08Oy (Bi-2223) tapes prepared by a two powder process that used powder containing varying lead contents, x, from 0.2 to 0.5 were subjected to thermomechanical processing and then characterized by XRD, SEM and EDX. Texture was studied using image analysis software on scanned SEM images. It was found that tapes with low lead content (0.20 and 0.25) showed incomplete conversion to Bi-2223, had small grain size, and poor c-axis texture. Tapes having higher lead content (0.4 and 0.5) also showed incomplete conversion and the presence of lead-rich secondary phases. Tapes with lead contents of 0.30 and 0.35 showed complete conversion to Bi-2223, had the least amount of secondary phases, showed best c-axis texture, and had the highest Jc. The carbon content of the precursor powder also had a strong influence on secondary phase chemistry. Work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as part of a DOE program to develop electric power technology, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38.

<P>EFFECT OF PARTICLE SIZE REDUCTION ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AND CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITY OF Ag/Bi-2223 TAPES:</B> Weon-Ju Kim, Jae-Keun You, Ho Jin Lee, 
Hee-Gyoun Lee, <I>Gye-Won Hong</I>, Superconductivity Research Laboratory, Korea 
Atomic Energy Research Institute, P.O. Box 105, Taejon 305-600, Korea
<P>
The effects of the particle size of precursor powder on the microstructure and Jc of Ag-sheathed Bi-2223 tapes were investigated. The calcined powder with overall composition of Bi1.89Pb0.41Sr2.01Ca2.23Oy was milled for various times using planetary ball mill. The transport property of the tapes was found to depend strongly on the particle size of the precursor powder. Enhanced reactivity of the milled powder facilitated the formation of 2223 phase and resulted in an increase of Jc. Excessive milling, however, led to the amorphisation of the powder and degraded the electrical property of the tapes.

<P>EFFECTIVE FABRICATION PRACTICES FOR Ag-SHEATHED SUPERCONDUCTOR: </B><I>D.-W. Yuan</I>, M. J. Pollock, J. Kajuch, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, Johnstown, PA 15904
<P>
The powder-in-tube (PIT) process has been widely used to fabricate long lengths of superconducting wires and tapes. However, problems associated with irregularly shaped cross sections resulting from the metalworking process have been identified and need to be addressed. In this investigation, Ag-clad Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 superconductors were formed by using different wire drawing and tape rolling practices. The effects of annealing and drawing direction on geometric characteristics of the round wires were determined. Also, the impact of reduction in thickness per pass and roll configuration on the properties of the tapes was investigated. The study shows that geometrical uniformity and core dimensional stability are strongly influenced by the rolling parameters chosen. A combination of small roll diameter and small reduction per pass reduces dimensional variations. This practice also leads to higher critical current densities at cryogenic temperatures in the resulting superconducting tapes. Recommendations for optimum fabrication schemes for wires and tapes are presented.

<P>A tubular architecture provides many potential attributes when applied to 
bulk superconductor structures. These include enhanced structural stability 
compared to wires and tapes, and isotropic field dependence transverse to 
the conductor&iacute;s long axis. At the same time, virtues associated with 
traditional OPIT processing may be preserved, such as a thin, dense HTSC layer 
with basal-plane texture. In this study, candidate deformation processing 
routes for tubular composite conductors were investigated in order to determine 
their potential to produce desired structures and properties. These processes 
included tube drawing, tube ironing, and hydrostatic extrusion. For tube 
drawing and ironing, an HTSC precursor form was isostatically pressed over 
a mandrel, while the hydrostatic extrusion billet was manually loaded 
with powder. The as-deformed and sintered tubes were characterized for 
geometric uniformity, density, texture, and transport properties. An analysis of 
the relative stress states encountered during tube processing compared with 
rolling will also be presented.

<P>MECHANICAL DEFORMATION AND INHOMOGENEITY OF BiSrCaCuO/Ag COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Z. Han</I> and T. Freltoft, NKT Research Center A/S, Sognevej 11, DK-2605, Br&oslash;ndby, Denmark
<P>
The mechanical deformation of BiSrCaCuO/Ag composites is generally 
an inhomogeneous process. Inadequate control of the deformation process 
results in sausaging and cracking, degrading the superconducting properties 
of the composite and reducing its mechanical strength. In this paper, we 
will apply our model of &quot;powder flow&quot; to describe the mechanical 
deformation process of BiSrCaCuO/Ag composites wires and tapes. Furthermore, 
results from experiments using a new deformation method &quot;semi-continuous 
pressing&quot; will be presented. By this method, it is possible to produce 
superconducting tapes with better homogeneity than obtained by conventional 
rolling. The influence of mechanical deformation on the strength of the tape, 
especially the bending strength, will also be discussed.

<P>
Recent activity of high temperature superconductors and its application at Toshiba will be presented. We have been developing high tensile strength conductor using AgMg(Ni) sheath material. Short samples exhibited 200 MPa of 0.2% yield strength which was 4 times to 10 times higher than that of the conventional Ag-sheathed conductor and also higher than the Nb8Sn conductor. Recently the high tensile strength conductor 100 m long was successfully fabricated and wound for the energizing test at 21 Tesla back up filed. The coil was successfully excited without any degradation. We have been also studying the effect of sausaging on critical current density. The sausaging started to occur clearly when the Vickers hardness of the oxide core was higher than that of Ag sheath. This implies that the harder sheath materials such as AgMg sheath may suppress the sausaging and improve critical current density.

<P>
We have resolved the issue of current distribution inside Ag-clad (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Oy (Bi-2223) superconductor tapes by showing that the region of high critical current density (Jc) is next to the Ag sheath. In this talk, we report a Jc value &gt;105 A/cm2 at 77 K in a self-field in Bi-2223 tapes made by the Ag-wire-in-tube method, in which a silver wire was introduced into the Ag tube. The Ag wire extended along the entire length of the tape. At 77 K and in self-field, a maximum Jc of 2 x 105 A/cm2 (critical current, Ic, = 22 A) was measured after three pressing cycles. Recently, we analyzed the transport current properties of Ag-clad Bi-2223 tapes as a function of cooling rate. A comparison between furnace-cooled and slow-cooled tapes showed that the slow-cooled tapes reached Ic values two or three times higher than those of the furnace-cooled tapes. Based on our observations, a cooling schedule that includes several intermediate cooling steps is suggested and will be discussed in this talk. Work at ANL and part of the work at IGC is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as part of a DOE program to develop electric power technology, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38.

<P>
Our long-term joint project covers both the development of HTS conductors and the realization of junction models demonstrating the feasibility of future prototypes. Multifilament 2223 BPSCCO tapes are reproducibly produced having jc-s up to 30 kA/cm2 for short samples and jc <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">20 kA/cm2 for lengths <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">110m. In a first step two layer 10 m cable dfunction model was machine wound, which showed a current capacity of 1100 A. No degradation was found under bending tests down to bending radii of 1 m. The switching elements for resistive fault current limiters consist of ceramic plates with meander shaped YBCO coatings. Two ways are investigated: both polycrystalline YSZ substrates coated by biaxially in plane oriented IBAD YSZ buffer layers (pc) and single crystal sapphire substrates (sc). 10x10 cm2 pc switching elements have been produced up to a switching power of 1500 VA (jc=60 kA/cm2). Improvements of the large scale IBAD-deposition raised jc above 105 A/cm2, small samples (1x1 cm2) attained jc=1 MA/cm2, 10x10 cm2 pc- or alternatively &oslash; sc switching elements are the basis of the proposed 100 kVA function model.

<P>CRITICAL CURRENT IN SMALL ANGLE GRAIN BOUNDARIES:</B> <I>C.S. Pande, </I>R.A. Masumura, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375-5343
<P>
It is now well known that even small angle grain boundaries (misorientation angle <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> &frac34; 10) show drastic reduction in inter-grain critical current. Drawing upon on our previous work, we show that this reduction must be ascribed to the stress field in proximity of the dislocations forming the small angle boundary. The alternate view that the reduction is due to the presence of dislocation cores is investigated by calculating their size as a function of misorientation. We show that the concept though probably valid for large misorientation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif"> 10) leads to serious disagreement with experiments for small values (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> &#190; 10).

A thin film of YBa2Cu3O7-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> prepared by laser ablation and shaped by etching as a long strip was studied by magneto-optic imaging. The penetration of a perpendicular magnetic field was investigated in detail, and a model-independent method of determining the space-resolved current distribution was developed. The inverse magnetic problem, i.e., that of using a field map to derive the underlying current distribution, is formulated and solved analytically for the strip geometry. The observed current profile across the strip gives direct evidence for the assumptions made in the Bean model. Also other geometries were investigated, demonstrating the new application of magneto-optics as a tool to determine current flow patterns.

<P>
<P>High current densities have been recently demonstrated at 77 K in thick film YBCO superconductor deposited on biaxially-textured metallic substrates. The effort at Intermagnetics has been directed towards the development of an industrially scaleable process based on biaxially-textured substrate technology. Biaxially-textured metallic substrates have been fabricated in long lengths with an average in-plane orientation better than 10&#176; and an average out-of-plane orientation better than 7&#176;. Buffer layers that are structurally and chemically compatible with YBCO have been deposited on the metallic substrates with a biaxial texture similar to that of the substrate. Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) has been used for deposition of YBCO since this technique enables a high rate of deposition that is not limited by line-of-sight. Stoichiometric, dense, and biaxially-textured films of YBCO superconductor have been successfully deposited by MOCVD on the biaxially textured substrates. This research was partially supported by the Department of Energy.

<P>
<P>A method to obtain long lengths of flexible, biaxially oriented substrates with smooth, chemically compatible surfaces for epitaxial growth of high temperature superconductors is reported. The technique uses well established, industrially scaleable, thermomechanical processes to impart a strong biaxial texture to a base metal like Ni. This is followed by vapor deposition of epitaxial buffer layers (metal and/or ceramic) to yield chemically compatible surfaces for HTS film deposition. Substrates prepared using this method are referred to as Rolling Assisted Biaxially Textured Substrates (RABITS). Epitaxial YBCO films grown using laser ablation on RABITS have critical current densities exceeding 7 x 105 A/cm2 at 77 K in zero-field and have field dependences similar to epitaxial films on single crystal ceramic substrates. The texture of the base metal has been achieved in lengths over 1 m and scaleable techniques are being pursued to deposit epitaxial multilayers. Deposited conductors made using this technique offer a potential route for the fabrication of long lengths of high Jc wire capable of carrying high currents in high magnetic fields and at elevated temperatures.

<P>TRANSPORT BEHAVIOR OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN YBa2Cu3O7<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/partial-bold.gif">: A COMPARISON BETWEEN THIN FILM AND BULK Bi-CRYSTALS:</B> <I>D.J. Miller</I>, V.R. Todt, M.

<P>
The structure and transport properties of grain boundaries in thin film and bulk bi-crystals of YBa2Cu3O7<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/partial.gif"> have been studied in detail. The thin film bi-crystals were prepared by sputter deposition onto SrTiO3 bi-crystal substrates while the bulk bi-crystals were prepared by a dual-seeded melt textured growth process. The structures of these two types of grain boundaries can be very different: thin film boundaries typically exhibit meandering and impurity phases that extend through the thickness of the film while the bulk boundaries tend to be very straight and relatively free of impurity phases. A comparison of the transport behavior between these two types of boundaries will be presented and the implications of the similarities and differences will be discussed.

PROCESS OPTIMIZATION FOR YBCO THICK FILMS:</B> <I>J.S. Abell</I>, T.C. Shields, J. Langhorn, S.C. Watcham, School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK
<P>
Superconducting thick films are finding technological exploitation in various applications; for example as inductive components in power engineering designs such as fault current limiters, and as microwave devices like filters in cellular communications applications. For efficient performance in these different fields superconducting properties require optimisation with respect to different parameters such as critical current density (Jc) and surface resistance (Rs). The microstructural control to deliver these properties demands careful processing. Flux pinning additions, composition control, doping, and novel processings techniques have been employed to improve the characteristics of the films. Barrier layer technology to enable the exploitation of low dielectric loss and economically attractive alumina substrates has been studied. The relationship between processing, microstructure and superconducting behavior will be discussed.

<P>Scaling up PVD and CVD techniques to reasonable manufacturing levels has been a scientific and engineering challenge for companies developing HTS materials for commercial applications. In this paper, we discuss the process development and optimization work associated with ramping up a multi-wafer reactive co-evaporation deposition system capable of depositing high quality YBCO on 2&quot; to 8&quot; wafers (R-pl sapphire or LaAlO3). YBCO thin films deposited using this technique exhibit good electrical properties with transition temperatures 85-87 K and Jc &gt;2 x 106 A/cm2 at 77K.

PHASE DIAGRAM AND CATION DISORDER STUDIES IN RE1+xBa2xCu3O7+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta-bold.gif">, RE= Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd: </B><I>M. J. Kramer</I>, H. Wu, K.W. Dennis, R.W. McCallum, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
For the light rare earth elements, the orthorhombic REBa2Cu3O7-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> structure forms not as a line compound but with varying degrees of RE+3 substitution on the Ba+2 sites and additional oxygen incorporated in the basal plane to balance charge. It has been demonstrated that for RE = Nd, Pr, (Nd + Pr), and (Nd + Gd), the occupation of RE on Ba sites is a function of the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and temperature. Not only is the minimum value of x effected but for a fixed value of x, large changes in the superconducting transition are observed. By manipulating the pO2 and T profile, phase assemblage can be modified. Under proper processing conditions, these second phases can form pinning sites in these materials, resulting in enhanced high field critical currents.

THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING PARAMETERS ON Hg-1223 TAPE FABRICATION: </B><I>R. Meng</I>, Y.Wang, B. Hickey, K. Ross, Y. Xue, C.W. Chu, Texas Center for Superconductivity, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5932
<P>
We have developed a process to fabricate Hg-1223 tape on a metal substrate with a transition temperature of 130 K and a self-field critical current density of 2 x 104 A/cm2 at 77 K. However, the reproducibility of the tape is poor and weak links exist in the tape so prepared. We have therefore investigated the chemical stabilities, processing parameters, and Ni doping effect on the Hg-1223 phase formation and grain growth. We found that doping can suppress the volatility of Hg in Hg-1223 and speed up the growth of Hg-1223. While Ni was found to be better than the other metal substrates tested it failed to retain its integrity for prolonged exposure to the processing conditions. Only a slight amount of Ni can be incorporated into the Hg-1223 grain, and it usually enters the Cu sites leadiing to a slight suppression of Tc. Proper processing conditions to eliminate the diffusion of Ni to Hg-1223, while favoring the growth and alignment of the Hg-1223 tape, will be discussed.

We have produced silver-sheathed HgBa2CuO4+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> superconducting wires and tapes exhibiting a transition temperature of 96 K.

Various routes have been adopted to optimize superconductivity in HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> tapes: these include packing superconducting Hg-1223 powders in tubes, mixing pre-formed materials with mixtures of oxides in different ratios, using precursors, etc. Phase purity, texture and morphology of samples has been investigated using XRD and SEM.

EFFECT OF COMPOSITION ON GROWTH MECHANISM IN SEEDED-MELT PROCESSED YBa2Cu3Ox: </B> <I>D. Shi</I>, K. Lahiri, S. Sagar, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0012<P>
Single- and multiple-domain levitators of YBa2Cu3Ox have been processed using the seeded melt texturing method. It has been found that the growth rate has varied depending upon the undercooling, the temperature gradient, and composition. A systematic study has been carried out to establish the relationship between the growth front velocity and composition, in particular the 211 concentration. For a given undercooling and temperature gradient, the growth rate of the domain can be strongly affected by the 211 density in the matrix. Evidences will be provided to show the important contributions of compositions and 211 morphology to the growth rates of center domain during the seeded melt texturing.

The effects of CeO2 and BaCeO3 additions on the microstructure and magnetic properties of melt textured YBa2Cu3O7-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> (Y-123) have been investigated. Both types of additions are effective in reducing the coarsening of Y2BaCuO5 particles in the melt during texturing. Both additions also lead to improvements in the magnetic properties of Y-123 compared to samples without Ce-based additions. The Ce-based additions are found to produce a &quot;peak effect&quot; in the magnetic hysteresis loop. The dependence of microstructure and magnetic flux pinning properties on the amount of Ce-based addition will be discussed.

A smooth transition is observed in the growth anisotropy with increasing undercooling, with the growth being faster along the c-axis at low undercoolings (15 to 25&#176;C) and faster along the a-b plane at high undercoolings (&gt;25&#176;C). Based on these findings, a modified melt-texturing process was developed, where, instead of slow cooling following melting, an isothermal hold was employed in the temperature range where the growth is isotropic. By this modification, the time required to texture 1&quot; diameter disks was reduced to 15 hours which is about 4 to 5 times faster than a typical slow cooling melt-texturing process. Correspondingly, the same magnitude of levitation force was achieved in a much shorter time in samples quenched during the modified process. Further, this process modification enabled a single do main growth over the entire sample thickness of 0.5&quot;, which could not be achieved by the slow cooling process. This research was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

HIGH CRITICAL CURRENTS IN HIGH-ANGLE GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN YBCO SUPERCONDUCTOR:</B> <I>K. Salama</I>, S. Sathyamurthy, A.S. Parikh, Texas Center for Superconductivity, 3201 Cullen Blvd., University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5769<P>
A serious limitation to applications of YBCO superconductors is the presence of weak links in the form of grain boundaries. The high resistivity of YBCO grain boundaries is mainly attributed to the presence of solidified liquid phase and cracks at these boundaries. Using the liquid phase removal method, YBCO melt textured bars, over 10 cm in length and 0.5 cm2 in cross-section, are processed with &quot;clean&quot; grain boundaries free of secondary phases and cracks. Bars processed by this method are found to consist of several large domains separated by clean grain boundaries. The bars are polycrystalline in nature with an average of 5 grain boundaries for every one cm in length. Using transport current measurements, the bars are found to carry currents in excess of 1000 Amps (current limit of source available) at 77 K and self field with very small voltage drop (20 to 50 &#181;V). Also, the same effect persists in the presence of external magnetic field up to 1.5 T at 77K. Contrary to previous findings, the misorientation angles of grain boundaries in these samples are found to be significantly high, ranging between 30&#176; and 80&#176;. These results indicate that the high angle grain boundaries in these bars are capable of sustaining very large currents and therefore make them suitable for applications such as current leads and current limiters.

The aim of this paper is to report on investigations on the influence of alkali and rare-earth ions doping in Ca1-xSrxCuO2 and Ba2Cu3O4Cl2 (and related compounds), in particular on their synthesis conditions and crystallographic structures. We concentrate the attention on the possibility to induce a charge transfer mechanism between constitutive layers by impurity doping, leading to a possible insulating-metal (superconductor) transition.

The production of dense superconducting ceramics is affected by the thermal processing and parameters like the oxygenation process and the texture development. One of the serious problems which prevents the formation of useful REBa2Cu3O7-x-like bulk ceramics (RE = rare earth) for practical applications is the existence of weak links at the grain boundaries. Another annoying feature is that all usual containers or substrates for the growth react with the melt leading to a strong contamination of the &quot;in situ&quot; produced materials. The choice of the substrate is also very relevant for film growth. The cases of SrTiO3, MgO, Al2O3, and BaZrO3 crucibles for solution growth of single crystals of REBa2Cu3O7 has been investigated for the production of long length fibers or other complicated shapes of bulk Y or RE-123 materials. The chemical compatibility of the &quot;substrate&quot; towards the Y or RE-123 mixture is reported at various melt-texturing growth stages. For comparison, we looked at three different materials: BaZrO3, SrTiO3, and MgO.

MACROSEGREGATION OF 211 PARTICLES DURING ZONE MELT TEXTURING OF Y123:</B> H. Balwada, <I>P.J. McGinn</I>, Dept. of Chemical Engr., Univ. of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556<P>
The phenomenon of 211 particle pushing by the solidification front during zone melt texturing has been studied. In the presence of second phase additions of PtO2 and BaCeO3, 211 particle refinement occurs. This refinement results in macroscopic segregation of 211 particles to the periphery of the sample rod. This phenomenon has been observed in samples textured with additions of PtO2 (.2 wt% and .5 wt%) and BaCeO3 (2 wt%) at speeds of 0.5 mm/hr and 1mm/hr. Without additions to refine the 211, this phenomenon is not observed. It was also found that higher texturization speeds lead to multiple grain nucleation at the solid/liquid interface. Particle pushing continues to take place under these circumstances, as long as the growth mechanism does not become dendritic, in which case this phenomenon is not observed. Effects of various solidification parameters on the extent of 211 particle segregation will be discussed.

A thermodynamic approach has been applied to the processing of rare earth barium cuprate superconductors (ReBCO). Studies were made on various ReBCO thick films which had been screen-printed onto Ag substrates. Using a coulometric titration technique, thermodynamic studies and reduced temperature and pressure (RTP) processing methods were carried out the thick film samples of ReBCO/Ag. The parameters governing the melt processing of ReBCO/Ag were optimised with a knowledge of phase stabilities and phase relations with respect to both temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Furthermore, accurate control of the oxygen partial pressure enabled the determination of the phase chemistry and the crystal growth rates during processing.

Fault current limiters (FCL) have the potential of becoming one of the first major applications for high temperature superconductors. To improve commercial confidence in high temperature superconductivity, it is imperative that superconductors are produced and tested in certain applications. In this work, melt processed YBCO rings have been produced for use in an inductive fault current limiter. Various dopants and thermal treatments are utilized to improve the mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the material. Using the FCL, critical current density (Jc) measurements can be made. Several different arrangements of the components of the FCL and the limiting performance are outlined. Characterization of the material is performed using polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and pulsed Jc measurements. The final aim of this work is to determine whether bulk YBCO is suitable for use in inductive fault current limiters.

ADVANCES IN THE PROCESSING AND APPLICATIONS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING FILMS:</B> A. Gupta, <I>M. Sisodia</I>, R.K. Yadava, Dept. of Metallurgical Engineering, Malaviya Regional Engineering College, Jaipur 302 017, India<P>
High critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductors have captured the interest of engineers and scientists world wide. For its commercial utilization in the field of microelectronics and electronic systems, they must be fabricated into desirable configurations - thin and thick films. During studies, it has been observed that these superconducting thin films operating at liquid N2 temperature offer great possibilities for faster, more sensitive and precise electronics devices. Present paper reviews the fabrication techniques of high-Tc superconducting thin films which primarily includes pulsed laser deposition, molecular ion beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by using epitaxial growth on single crystal substrates (YSZ, MgO, Si, etc.) with excellent microstructural control and properties relationship. In addition to it, thick film fabrication is also discussed with major techniques like screen printing and plasma spraying along with associated processing parameters. Furthermore, advanced applications of each are enumerated at length.

THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox/Ag SUPERCONDUCTOR: </B><I>K. Togano</I>, H. Kumakura, H. Kitaguchi, H. Fujii, National Research Institute for Metals, Tsukuba 305, Japan; T. Hasegawa, Y. Hikichi, Showa Electric Wire and Cable Co., Ltd., Kawasaki 210, Japan
<P>
The Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox/Ag(2212) conductors with high Jc can be fabricated by applying partial melting process, in which the 2212 phase melts incongruently. However, the presence of nonsuperconducting solid phases in the liquid makes it very difficult to achieve an ideal grain alignment of 2212 phase on cooling. In this paper, we report detailed studies on the distribution of nonsuperconducting phases and its effect on the nucleation and growth behavior of 2212 crystals. As one of the methods to control the distribution, we applied centrifugal gravity fields of up to ~100 g to the samples during melting process. Gravity effect was more significant for thick 2212 conductor, for which interface effect was less dominant. The improvement of grain alignment for the multilayered Ag/2212 conductors and the results of Jc measurement will be presented.

REACT-WIND-AND-SINTER TECHNIQUE FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF POWDER-IN-TUBE Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox COILS:</B> <I>J. Schwartz, </I>S. Boutemy, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, 1800 E. Dirac Dr., Tallahassee, FL 32310
<P>
Heat treating powder-in-tube Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox coils such that short sample properties are obtained in large quantities is an important challenge. The wind-and-react technique suffers from poor temperature control due to the coil thermal mass and the sensitivity of the superconductor to the peak temperature and cooling rates. With the react-and-wind approach, however, optimum conductor performance is not obtained since it is degraded by strain during winding. A new technique is being developed at the NHMFL: the react-wind-and-sinter technique. Long lengths of powder-in-tube conductor are reacted by pulling the tape through a furnace with a controlled atmosphere. The temperature profile is controlled to emulate the partial-melt step of the conventional heat treatment. This method allows a more uniform reaction in long lengths of conductor. The tape is then insulated and wound into the desired coil shape and sintered isothermally. This repairs the cracks and achieves high phase purity and grain alignment. Here we report progress on this approach for HTS coils.

DEVELOPMENT OF LONG LENGTH Bi-2212 SUPERCONDUCTORS: </B><I>R. Wesche</I>, EPFL, Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas, CH-5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland
<P>
Superconducting AgNiMg and Ag/Bi-2212 multicore wires of up to 40 m length have been fabricated by the powder-in-tube method. The optimum heat treatment conditions and the critical temperature have been found to depend on the wire diameter and the matrix material. In addition, the cooling rates are of importance for the achievable Tc values. Generally, the AgNiMg-sheathed wires behave like thinner Ag/Bi-2212 wires. Maximum Tc values of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 92K have been achieved for both matrix materials. These observations suggest very rapid grain-boundary assisted diffusion of oxygen through the AgNiMg matrix. Short sample jc values (1 mV/cm) of up to 80,000 A/cm2 (4.2 K, B=0) and 3000 A/cm2 (77 K, B=0) have been achieved in Ag/Bi-2212 multicore wires of 1 mm diameter. For AgNiMg/Bi-2212 multicore wires of 1.5 mm diameter maximum zero field jc values of 55,000 and 2000 A/cm2 have been reached at 4.2 and 77K, respectively. First results for the jc values in Bi-2212 wires of long lengths will be presented.

HOT-DEFORMATION TREATMENTS OF Y123 AND Bi2223 MATERIALS: </B><I>Q.Y. Hu</I>, D. Yu, H.K. Liu, T. Chandra, S.X. Dou, Centre for Superconducting and Electronic Materials, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia
<P>
Y123 and Bi2223 bulks were hot compressed isothermally in a temperature range of 780-850&#176;C under constant stresses of 15-50 MPa for 60 min. It was found that the mass density of the bulk Y123 and Bi2223 superconductors has been increased. This was achieved by reducing the enclosed voids in the materials under the pressure at high temperature. In addition of high mass density, texture structure in the superconductors has also been improved by hot compressing which in turn increased critical current of both materials. Ag-sheathed Bi2223 wires were hot-rolled into thin tapes at about 800&#176;C at a four-high laboratory rolling machine with attachment of a tube furnace. It was found that hot-rolled tapes had higher core mass density but sausaging was severer than cold-rolled samples. Apart from the hot rolling, the Bi2223 tapes were also hot compressed under the condition of uniaxial loading and it was found that the treatment enhanced the core density, resulting in the improvement of the critical current of the samples.

EFFECT OF pO2, C, AND Ag ON THE DECOMPOSITION PATHWAYS IN THE Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O: </B><I>R.W. McCallum</I>, L. Margulies, K.W. Dennis, M.J. Kramer, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
The promise of usable forms of high temperature superconducting wires and tapes rests on developing techniques for processing highly textured materials. Understanding the effect of Ag and pO2 on the chain of peritectic reactions initiated during melting is necessary in order to optimize the processing parameters of Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O-Ag composites. Previously, work on the solubility of Ag in the Bi2212 melt revealed a large liquid immiscibility gap and a eutectic on each side of this gap. In addition, the sub-liquidus phase reactions in this system were examined in greater detail for 0.01, 0.2, and 1.0 bar pO2. This work showed that the peritectic reactions varied as a function of pO2. The role of Ag was shown only to depress the peritectic decomposition temperatures. C was shown to have only a very minor effect for near stoichiometric materials. This work is currently being extended to the Bi2221 + Ag system.

THICK-FILM PROCESSING FOR TL-OXIDE WIRE AND TAPE:</B> <I> R.D. Blaugher</I>, R.N. Bhattacharya, D. Ginley, P. Parilla, D. Schulz, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO 80401
<P>
Thick-film processing using techniques such as dip coating, ink spraying and electrodeposition represent promising approaches for fabricating HTS wire or tape for the Tl-oxide superconductors. The wire and tape processing for long lengths of the Tl-oxides, in contrast to the Bi-materials, is not as well advanced due primarily to a lower level of effort. The Tl-oxides, moreover, offer the potential for operation at 77K in practical magnetic fields of 3-5 T, which is supported by measurements on the irrreversibility behavior of the Tl-1223 single layer compound with Pb and Sr substitution. Thick-film processing methods such as electrodeposition and ink spraying present a viable approach for producing a cost effective HTS wire or tape with technologically acceptable transport properties. This paper will review the progress in the Tl-oxide wire and tape processing for thick-film techniques. The relative merits of conventional mixed-oxide and highly reactive sub-micron precursor as prepared by electrodeposition will be discussed. The prospects and predicted cost for a &quot;long length&quot; thick-film process using electrodeposition and ink spraying will also be presented.

THE EFFECTS OF CARBON ON TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox PHASE FORMATION IN THE Tl(F)-Ba-Ca-Cu-O SYSTEM:</B> <I>Y.S. Sung</I>, X.F. Zhang, P.J. Kostic, D.J. Miller, Materials Science Division and Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
The effects of carbon on TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox phase formation in the Tl(F)-Ba2Ca2Cu3Oz system have been investigated. Samples of varying carbon content were prepared by controlling the carbon content in the Ba2Ca2Cu3Oz precursor powders that were mixed with TlF and reacted to form the superconducting phase. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and DC magnetization. It was found that carbon induced the formation of the Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy phase. While TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox was the primary phase at low carbon contents, Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy became the dominant phase at high carbon contents, in spite of a 1:2:2:3 (Tl:Ba:Ca:Cu) starting composition. For intermediate carbon levels, there was a strong tendency to form superlattices as a result of intergrowth between TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy. This work was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences-Materials Sciences, under Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38 and by the National Science Foundation through the Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity under Contract No. DMR 91-20000.

USE OF PARTIAL MELTING IN Tl-1223 COIL PRODUCTION:</B> <I>J.C. Moore</I>, S. Fox, M.J. Naylor, S.K. Wivell, C.R.M. Grovenor, University of Oxford, Dept. of Materials, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PH, UK
<P>
We have investigated a number of practical aspects in the manufacture of demonstrator coils from Tl-1223 PIT tape. Coils have been fabricated using a wind and react method from 5 m tapes with an insulating MgO coating, giving engineering Jc values of 2500 Acm-2. However, the performance of these sintered tapes in external magnetic field is at present poor. Previous work has suggested that only improved grain alignment can overcome this weak link problem and we have chosen to investigate a melt processing route in order to achieve this. A considerable effort has been put into correlating the effects of process variables (melt T, heating and cooling rates) on the microstructure in PIT samples. We will discuss the choice of precursor powder, composition of 1223 and heating schedule which gives the best properties in small coils.

MODIFICATION OF Bi-2223 PRECURSORS BY POWDER ENGINEERING METHODS:</B> <I>O.A. Shlyakhtin</I>, A.L. Vinokurov, V.V. Ischenko, N.N. Oleinikov, Dept. of Chemistry, Moscow State University, 119899 Moscow, Russia
<P>
Reactivity of Bi-2223 precursors is rather sensitive to the microstructure of the last ones, i.e., to the size of 2212 particles and spatial distribution of minor phases. The primary way to change precursor microstructure is connected with the change of precursor synthesis technique. Relying on our studies of particle size evolution during synthesis and thermal treatment of oxide powders, we propose a method of fine and directed modification of precursor microstructure in frames of the same synthesis technique. This method is based on the mechanical and ultrasonic treatment of precursor powders at the intermediate stages of their synthesis by chemical methods.

RECENT ADVANCES IN POLYCRYSTALLINE OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTORS: PROCESSING, PROPERTIES, AND APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>M. Sisodia</I>, A. Gupta, R.K. Yadava, Dept. of Metallurgical Engineering, Malaviya Regional Engineering College, Jaipur 302 017, India
<P>
This talk will review some of the processing techniques adaptable to high-Tc superconductor fabrication with much emphasis on desirable geometries, improved properties, microstructure control, and its associated practical problems that result in its good performance in magnetic fields. It has been observed that the improvement and optimization of Jc is hindered by the formation of jospehson weak links at grain boundaries, flux creep/flux flow effects, and anisotropic properties in polycrystalline high-Tc superconducting materials. Although the oxide superconductors in polycrystalline form have very poor in-field Jc, it can be improved by studying the current flow. The inhomo geneous current flow in these materials is discussed with the help of results for laser slicing and magnetooptic imaging experiments. Lastly, the advanced applications of each are discussed.

Two kinds of compact superconducting magnet have been fabricated with Bi-2212/Ag multifilamentary tapes. These magnets are stacked double pancake type and made by a wind and react process. One of them has the dimensions of 55 mm in height, 49 mm in outer diameter, and 12.5 mm in clear bore. The magnet was inserted in a 21-T-class superconducting magnet system and tested in various field at 4.2 K. In zero bias field, the magnet carries 400 A (criterion: 10-13 Wm) and generates 2.5 T. In the bias field of 21.1 T, the magnet successfully generates 1.76 T with the current of 281 A, i.e., the total field reaches 22.8 T which is the highest field ever achieved with a superconducting magnet. Transport current properties in bias fields for the other magnet with the outer diameter over 90 mm are also reported.

EFFECTS OF MECHANCIAL STRAIN ON Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox/AgX COMPOSITE CONDUCTORS:</B> <I>J. Schwartz</I>, B.C. Amm, H. Garmestani, Y. Hascicek, D.K. Hilton, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, FL 32310
<P>
The development of powder-in-tube Bi2Sr2Can-1)CunOx technology has progressed such that high critical current density (Jc) conductors are produced by many researchers. An important issue that remains, however, is the effects of mechanical strain. While it is evident that large strains induce irreversible damage, applications may be limited by fatigue at low strain values due to crack propagation. Here we report upon the effects of cyclic fatigue on Jc of Ag and Ag-alloy clad Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox as measured by electrical transport and magnetic hysteresis. Measurements of the constituent and composite mechanical properties and bulk Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox fracture toughness are also reported. As Jc may be limited by microcracks before straining, studies of crack propagation and mechanical strain effects may also provide insight into the fundamental limits to transport Jc. Results are interpreted within this framework as well.

PROPERTIES AND PROCESSING OF MULTIFILAMENTARY PIT FORMED USING THE CTFF PROCESS:</B> <I>M.D. Sumption</I>*, S.X. Dou**, N.V. Vo**, and E.W. Collings*; *MSE, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; **CSEM, The University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia
<P>
Multifilamentary Bi2212 strands with up to 37 filaments have been formed using Continuous-Tube-Forming-Filling (CTFF). The CTFF process is used for the initial monocore, which is then restacked via a conventional PIT process, and these strands are then rolled into tapes. A sterling Ag outer shell is used, but the matrix region used pure Ag. Self field Jc at 4.2 K is 9.16 kA/cm2. The resulting filaments are aspected, with dimensions 7.5 x 370 mm. A vibrating sample magnetometer has been used to measure M-H loops (losses). Losses were measured, and it was possible to separate out; (i) critical state losses, (ii) eddy current losses, (iii) logarithmic type creep influences on the losses, and (iv) exponential type creep influences on the losses.

<P>
Long lengths of Ag-alloy sheathed Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2Ox (2212) multifilament wires and tapes have been fabricated and heat treated. Sample lengths of one to two meters are cut after melt processing and wound into standard holders used to test NbTi for MRI. The performance characteristics of the 2212 conductors, that is the critical current density, the overall critical current density, and the n-values of a number of samples as a function of the applied magnetic field (0-9 Tesla) at 4.2 K will be reported.

IMPROVEMENTS IN Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox CONDUCTOR VIA DOPANTS:</B> <I>J. Schwartz</I>*, A. Bhargava**, B. Boutemy*, and W. Wei*; *National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, 1800 E. Dirac Dr., Tallahassee, FL 32310; **University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 3072, Australia
<P>
An important characteristic of high temperature superconducting materials is the ability to carry large Jc at high magnetic field. As a result, the NHMFL anticipates using HTS conductor for the highest field region of the 1 GHz NMR magnet system. Two obstacles to high field Jc over long lengths are poor flux pinning and carbon-induced bubbling and tunneling. Here we report progress on these two challenges via fine-scale additives to the starting powder. To address the flux pinning issue, we are investigating nano-scale MgO additions. By growing the 2212 grains around the MgO particles, pinning centers are directly incorporated in the superconducting grains. To prevent bubbling and tunneling from CO2 gas that forms during melt processing we are investigating Ba-O additions. By trapping the carbon in BaCO3, CO2 formation is prevented. We report magnetic and electrical measurements of Jc, extensive microscopy, and x-ray diffraction of tapes formed with these approaches.

<P>ELEVATED TEMPERATURE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NEAR-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha-bold.gif"> TITANIUM ALLOY TIMETAL 1100:</B> <I> J. Lindemann</I>, A. Styczynski, L. Wagner, Technical University of Brandenburg at Cottbus, 03013 Cottbus, Germany
<P>
Fully lamellar with fine (150 m) and coarse (500 m) prior B grain sizes as well as duplex structures with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p volume fractions of 20 and 60% (15 m <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p size) were prepared in TIMETAL 1100 by thermomechanical processing. Tensile behavior and HCF properties at R=-1 and R=0.1 were evaluated at ambient and elevated (600&#176;C) were performed at nominal stresses of 210 and 300 MPa. The fine grained fully lamellar microstructure combines the advantages of the B annealed structures (excellent creep resistance) and duplex structures (high tensile ductility) without suffering from the disadvantages of the duplex structures, i.e., anomalous mean stress sensitivity of the fatigue strength and poor creep strength. Both properties are related to the presence of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p phase. The fatigue and creep results on the various microstructures will be interpreted in terms of phase morphologies, crystallographic textures and particular deformation mechanisms.

<P>
The creep behavior of a high temperature near <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> alloy Ti 6242 Si has been investigated in the stress range from 160 to 350 MPa and a temperature range from 500 to 600&#176;C, using constant stress tensile creep experiments. Emphasis has been put on primary and anelastic creep behavior and their dependencies on stress, strain and processes microstructures. It is shown that both primary and anelastic creep strongly depend on creep strain and applied stress. Increasing stress and/or strain results in higher primary and anelastic creep strains. Furthermore, &szlig;-heat treated specimens with a fully transformed &szlig;-microstructure show reduced amounts of primary and anelastic creep strains, in comparison to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+&szlig; heat treated specimens with globular <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-grains and variable amounts of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+&szlig; mixture. The results obtained show also very similar kinetics of primary creep build up and strain recovery and suggest similar deformation mechanisms. Based on TEM investigations of dislocation structures of crept specimens, the results are discussed with respect to different mechanisms of dislocation motion under the effect of internal stress.

<P>
Normal liquid to solid partitioning of Cr during ingot solidification for the Ti-17 alloy can result in the formation of a segregation anomaly called &szlig; flecks. These &szlig; flecks can exhibit a significantly lower &szlig; transus than the alloy; they may also present mechanical property issues. While the major thrust toward minimizing &szlig; flecks is through melt process control, this paper addresses the capability of reducing the extent of Cr segregation using a high temperature &szlig; field homogenization heat treatment. The interdiffusion coefficients for Cr in &szlig; phase Ti-17 were determined and used in diffusion equations to calculate the rate of dissipation of the segregated regions. Correlation is shown for the calculated, and critical experiment demonstrated, increase in the &szlig; fleck &szlig; transus temperature with the time and temperature of these homogenization heat treatments.

<P>
Biaxial creep behavior of thin-walled tubing of cold-worked stress-relieved cp-titanium alloy was investigated using internal pressurization superimposed with axial load at ??? K. Creep anisotropy was characterized in terms of a creep locus at a constant energy dissipation with power-law dependencies of the component (hoop and axial) strain-rates under varied stress ratios. The experimental results were fit to the modified Hill's equation with anisotropy parameters, R and P which are also the contractile strain (rate) ratios. The crystallographic texture of the tubing was characterized through inverse and direct pole figures from which the <U>c</U>rystallite <U>o</U>rientation <U>d</U>istribution <U>f</U>unctions (CODF) were derived. The CODF was combined with plasticity model based on power-law stress dependence of the strain-rate and dominance of basal prism and pyramidal slip systems were considered. In contrast to the recrystallized materials, experimental results deviated from the prism-model predictions albeit the deformed microstructures revealed only prism dislocations. These differences are attributed to the grain-shape anisotropy due to cold-work. Quantitative analyses of the superimposed effects of grain shape anisotropy due to cold-work. Quantitative analyses of the superimposed effects of grain shape anisotropy on grain orientation anisotropy (texture) are underway and the results to-date will be presented.

The microstructural development of Ti-6Al-2Mo-2Cr-2Sn-2Zr-0.2Si(Ti-6-22-22S) alloy after various heat treatments has been examined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), coupled with high spatial resolution microanalysis. Partitioning of alloying elements and the precipitation of intermetallics as a function of heat treatment are the main issues addressed in this paper. Titanium silicide, athermal <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> and ordered <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 precipitates have been observed in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> and the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase respectively.

<P><B>INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATION BEHAVIOR AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE OF THE Ti-ALLOY IMI 834<I>:</B> O. Schauerte,</I>, A. Gysler, G. Lutjering, Technical University Hamburg-Harburg, 21071 Hamburg, Germany; S. Lesterlin, J. Petit, E.N.S.M.A., 86960 Futuroscope Cedex, France
<P>
The fatigue crack propagation behavior of the high-temperature Ti-alloy IMI 834 was investigated at a test temperature of 500&#176;C under different environmental conditions: vacuum, laboratory air, and Ar=50% relative humidity. Two different microstructures were compared, a pure lamellar and a bi-modal structure, consisting of 20% equiaxed primary a phase in a lamellar matrix. Crack propagation tests were carried out on CT-specimens under constant amplitude sinusoidal loading conditions with a frequency of 30 Hz at R=0.1 and R=0.6. The results showed for example, that at R=0.6 fatigue crack propagation for both microstructures occurred at much lower near threshold <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">K- values (4 MPa-m1/2) in the two aggressive environments (air, humid Ar) as compared to those measured in vacuum (10 MPa-m1/2). Furthermore, in an intermediate <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">K-regime (6 to 12 MPa-m1/2) the da/dN-K curves in the aggressive environments exhibited a plateau region with a nearly constant crack propagation rate of about 5x10-8m/cycle. At high growth rates these curves approached those measured in vacuum. The results will be discussed on the basis of fracture surface studies (e.g. cleavage-like features found in the aggressive environments in comparison to a ductile fracture mode in vacuum), through thickness crack front profile analysis, and crack closure measurements.

<P>
Following the discovery of improved oxidation resistance of Ti-Al-based alloys containing second phase precipitates of Al-rich Ti(Cr,Al)2, a similar approach was suggested for the o-phase. A schematic representation of the Ti-Al-Cr-Nb quaternary system was constructed at 800&#176;C. Subsequently, five alloys, based on the Ti-Al-Cr-Nb quaternary system were prepared in order to probe the phase equilibria between the corresponding Ti2AlX compositions of the Ti-Al-Nb and Ti-Al-Cr ternary systems. The samples were homogenized above the beta-transus then heat treated at 800&#176;C. The resulting phase equilibria and microstructure were evaluated. Additionally, cyclic oxidation studies, at 800 and 900&#176;C were conducted on the heat treated samples to assess their oxidation resistance. Similar behavior for the alloys was observed at 800&#176;C, however, at 900&#176;C the Cr rich alloys experienced significant spalling.

<P>
The oxidation behavior of ternary Ti3Al-Nb alloy has been studied in pure oxygen over the temperature range of 750&#176;C to 1100&#176;C. The experiments were carried out using TGA. The oxidation products were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDS. Parabolic rate constants were calculated. An effective activation energy of 268 KJ/mol was deduced. The oxidation products formed are non-continuous protective scale on Ti3Al-Nb alloys. The results showed that oxidation products were mainly a mixture of TiO2 (rutile) and Al2O3 (alumina). For oxidation scale at 1100&#176;C, it exhibited a layered scale of alternate rutile and alumina. The present results were also compared with that of binary Ti3Al.

<P>
<P>The phase equilibria in the technologically important Ti-Al-Nb ternary system are presented. Special emphasis is made in the composition regime where the Orthorhombic (O, Ti2AlNb, Cmcm) phase has considerable presence in the microstructures. Isothermal sections at temperatures at and above 700&#176;C are presented along with three vertical section at 22.5, 25 and 27.5 atomic % Al levels. The difficulties experienced in determining the phase diagrams, arising out of low diffusivities and the nature of the alpha2+B2<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif">O peritectoid transformation, are highlighted. The presence of a large solubility range for the single phase O phase field close to an Al content 27.5% is discussed in the light of the experimental results. Finally a clear definition of the areas wherein there exists a lack in our current understanding of the Ti-Al-Nb system are highlighted.

<P>
An orthorhombic titanium aluminide alloy ingot with a nominal composition of Ti-22Al-26Nb (atom percent) has been produced and converted to 6&quot; diameter billet. A continuous cooling transformation diagram was generated using compression samples, and TEM performed to understand phase evolution during cooling. A series of melts were cut from the 6&quot; billet and either forged into pancakes or rolled into rings using a variety of process routes. The effects of process variables and final heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the pancakes and rings have been evaluated. Mechanical properties included tensile (room temperature to 1300&#176;F), creep (1000&#176; - 1200&#176;F), fracture toughness (room temperature) and fatigue (room temperature to 1200&#176;F).

<P>
The ordering behavior of the orthorhombic (O, Ti2AlNb, Cmcm) phase are presented. The presence of the O phase in two distinct forms with different site occupations is discussed. They are (1) the O1 phase Nb atoms occupying the Ti sublattice randomly and (2) the O2 phase with a specific sublattice for the Nb atoms. Both O1 and O2 exhibit the same space group and lattice periodicity and this makes their identification from one another a difficult task. We present in this paper, the various diffraction effects which arise due to the different ordering behavior of the O phase, for both X-ray and electron diffraction. Specific reflections are singled out. A definition of the order parameter and its experimental determination are presented. Possible transitions between the two forms are presented in the spirit of the Landau-Lifshitz theory for order-disorder transformations.

<P>
Both uncoated and coated fatigue samples of the alloy Ti-22Al-26Nb were subjected to elevated temperature exposures in air. Oxygen ingress and interdiffusion (and reaction) of elements between coating and substrate cause changes in both microstructure and properties (i.e., embrittlement). After exposure, the microstructures of the substrate, the reaction zone and the oxidation products were examined, and fatigue tests were conducted. The suitability of selected coatings for protection of orthorhombic alloys against property degradation from exposure at elevated temperatures will be discussed.

<P>The development of a Ti-based metal matrix composite (MMC) material, capable of sustained and repeated exposure to service temperatures in the range of 650-760&#176;C (1200-1400&#176;F), has been undertaken in a U.S. Air Force sponsored program. Several performance characteristics qualify as &quot;critical&quot; for specific turbine engine component applications and service environments. To define these component-critical MMC characteristics, we selected a turbine engine compressor rotor, in which transverse tensile and creep strengths were found to be critical issues. Improvements in MMC transverse tensile and creep strengths can be made by increasing the matrix properties through alloy chemistry modifications, as well as through microstructural manipulation. This program, and others, have examined, in a systematic way, the effects of elemental additions, such as Mo, Ta, Si, V, and O, on mechanical properties, environmental resistance, and processability of Ti-Al-Nb alloys. These efforts have led to the state-of-the-art MMC matrix orthorhombic titanium aluminide alloy. This work was supported by Contract F33615-91-C-5647.

<P>
Titanium aluminide alloys containing the ordered orthorhombic phase, based on Ti2AlNb, are considered as potential materials for the compressor section of aerospace engines both in their monolithic form and as matrices in metal matrix composites. The microstructure (volume fraction of the ordered alpha-2, B2 and orthorhombic phases, grain size, lath size and spacing) has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of these materials. In this study two heat treatments of the orthorhombic alloy Ti-22A1-23Nb resulting in a fully transformed and a duplex microstructure were investigated. Room temperature and elevated temperature tensile and cyclic behavior including fatigue life, fatigue crack initiation and propagation will be discussed with respect to these microstructural conditions.

<P>EFFECT OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON THE CREEP AND RT TENSILE BEHAVIOR OF O+B2 ALLOYS</B>: C.J. Boehlert, B.S. Majumdar, <I>V. Seetharaman</I>, UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Road, Dayton, OH 45432-1894
<P>
The phase evolution, room temperature tensile, and elevated temperature creep behaviors of Ti-25Al-25Nb and Ti-23Al-27Nb have been examined. A variety of microstructures, consisting of different volume fractions of B2 and O were achieved through deformation processing and heat treatments. Supertransus heat treated microstructures suffered from intergranular attack and exhibited low ductility. Subtransus heat treated microstructures exhibited a balance of RT tensile and elevated temperature creep performance. Creep samples showed evidence of microstructural instability, involving cellular/widmanstatten precipitation of O phase within the B2 grains. The kinetics of O phase precipitation at the creep temperature, 650&#176;C, and the effect of this instability on creep are presented. In addition, overall effects of microstructural features on tensile, creep, and damage accumulation are discussed.

<B>PRODUCTION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE TITANIUM ALUMINIDE FOILS VIA PLASMA SPRAY PROCESSING:</B> <I>R.S. Thakur</I>, Mohit Sisodia*, M.K.

<P>
Plasma Spray Forming is a upscaled version of droplet deposition method from the melt, which combines the steps of melting, rapid solidification, and consolidation into a single operation. The present paper critically reviews the versatility of this process which is successfully applied to the synthesis of Ti alloys and Ti- aluminide preforms for subsequent cold rolling into thin foils. These Plasma Sprayed preforms are transformed into dense wrought Ti-aluminide foils by a roll consolidation process. It has been observed that production of this dense foils are as continuous coil, which would improve process efficiency and yield high quality at low cost. Actually these high strength Ti alloys and Ti-aluminide foils are required for fabricating composite structures for advanced aerospace technology and space shuttles. In addition to it, various parameters are discussed which primarily includes designing of optimum interface, growth kinetics etc., and became necessary in enhancing service life of these foils at elevated temperatures.

<P>
Many binary systems exhibit miscibility gaps in the liquid state. It is well known that melts which are passing a miscibility gap on cooling, solidify to a regular consisting of two layers. Such metallic solid bodies are not interesting for technical applications and have also scarcely been investigated scientifically. Genuine interest in demixing systems only arised as it seemed possible to prevent layer formation under zero gravity. However, experiments in space have shown that even under migro-g conditions, phase separation is occurring, yet in another way as on earth and also not finely dispersed. Afterwards, there resulted an intensive disclosure of the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the separation of liquid immiscible phases. After the discussion of the results obtained it is indicated how layer formation can be prevented and a finely dispersed structure can be realized in order to enable technical use.

<P>
<P>With a fully automated high temperature calorimeter (Tmax = 1800K) and using the direct drop method, the molar integral of formation of the binary liquid alloys (Ga and In with Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) have been measured with an accuracy of about 6%. From these results the molar partial enthalpies have been calculated and the transfer of electrons from the sp-metal to the transition metal has been deduced. Moreover some liquidus points of the equilibrium phase diagram of these systems have been obtained.

<P>
<P>A wide range of intermetallic compounds of transition metals and rare earth metals with tin have been studied by direct synthesis calorimetry at 1473 &#177; 2K. The results provide a picture of the systematic dependence of the standard enthalpy of formation of the compounds on the number of 3d-, 4d- and 5d-electrons in the considered transition metals, and on the number of f-electrons in the lanthanide metals. The results will be compared with earlier experimental data, where available, and with predictions from the semi-empirical model of Miedema and co-workers.

THE SHORT- AND MEDIUM-RANGE STRUCTURE CHARACTERISTIC OF AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>K. Suzuki</I>, K. Shibata, T. Otomo* and H. Mizuseki, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, *National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan<P>
Atoms in amorphous alloys are combined into a configuration of minimizing the local energy in the short-range structure instead of relaxing the total energy minimum of a system. The short-range order of amorphous alloys often shows similarity to that of their crystalline counterparts. The survival of the local coordination in amorphous alloys is also confirmed by the vibrational density-of-states. However, the medium-range structure of amorphous alloys has an quite unique nature in contrast to the crystalline alloys. The low-energy excitation in amorphous alloys appearing in the energy range of 1 to 3 meV, which is usually observed as an excess specific heat in addition to the Debye-type harmonic vibration, is contributed from the locally collective motion characterized spatially by the medium-range structure fluctuations. The experimental results mentioned above for Pd-Si, Pd-Ge, Pd-Ni-P and V-Ni amorphous alloys were observed by pulsed neutron scattering based on accelerators, which is a powerful tool for characterizing the structure of amorphous alloys, because a very wide dynamic range of energy- and momentum-transfer can be surveyed.

NEUTRON DIFFRACTION STUDIES OF LIQUID ZINTL-ALLOYS UP TO 2000:</B> <I>K.R. Winter</I>, University of Dortmund, Department of Chemistry, Physical Chemistry I, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany<P>
Neutron diffraction measurements have been carried out on equiatomic liquid Zntl-alloys, such as KPb, CsPb, and NaSn, over a wide temperature interval, ranging from 800 to 2000 K, and at pressures up to 150 bar. In the crystalline state, these are semiconducting compounds containing tetrahedrally coordinated polyanions. The diffraction results indicate the survival of polyanions in the expanded liquid alloys even up to high temperatures, as indicated by the persistence of the peak of S(Q) at Q<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif">1&Aring;-1, which is indicative of intermediate-range order. The position of this peak shifts towards lower Q-values, its height decreases, and its width drastically increases with increasing temperature and correspondingly decreasing density. The experimental results and the corresponding real-space information are compared with the crystal structures in the solid state and with the results of recent ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations and computer modelling studies. In addition, we present neutron diffraction data on the effect of pressure on the structure factor of solid CsPb in the rotator phase.

TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMORPHOUS TO THE NANO-CRYSTALLINE STATE:</B> R. Luck, K. Lu*, Max-Planck-Institut fur Metallforschung, SteebstraBe 75, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany, *also with National Laboratory for RSA, Institute of Metal Research, Academia Sinica, Shenyang 110015, China<P>
The crystallization of amorphous materials has been studied extensively during the last two decades. However, the formation of nanocrystals - that is a crystalline morphology with an average grain size of 5 to 50 nm - from t he amorphous state has been detected few years ago. Since that time it is used more and more. This procedure is performed isothermally below the crystallization temperature. We present data of the kinetics of this process. The transformation has been monitored by the measurement of several physical properties; we have applied especially the measurement of magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic measurements are able to detect the onset of the transformation of amorphous Ni-P alloys much earlier than was possible with differential scanning calorimetry. The transformation kinetics can be analyzed by means of the Avrami plot based on the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The kinetics of further solid state reactions in the nanostructured material can be investigated similarly.

THE EFFECT OF ORDER-DISORDER PHASE TRANSFORMATION ON VOLUME INTERDIFFUSION:</B> E. Rabkin, B. Straumal, <I>W. Gust</I>, Institute fur Metallkunde and Max-Planck-Institut fur Metallforschung, Seestr. 75, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany<P>
The volume interdiffusion has been studied in Fe-Si single crystals in the vicinity of A2-B2 ordering and in Cu-Au single crystals in the vicinity of Al-L12 ordering. Decreased interdiffusivity rates were found, as expected, in the ordered Fe-Si alloys. In the Cu-Au alloys, however, the interdiffusivity in the ordered region is higher than it could be expected by extrapolation of the diffusivities in the disordered phase. Different approaches were used to calculate the thermodynamic factor for interdiffusion, and the results obtained are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The influence of the variation of the partial molar volumes of the components during the phase transition on the calculated interdiffusivities is discussed.

THE METASTABLE STATE OF AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>R. Bormann</I>, Institute for Materials Research, GKSS Research Center, D-21494 Geesthacht, Germany<P>
In the past, the thermodynamic state of amorphous phases has been of great concern. Due to highly non-equilibrium preparation processes involving rapid quenching and condensation techniques it has been assumed that these alloys are frozen-in liquids where a thermodynamic description cannot be applied. Recently however, the existence of a metastable state in single-phase and phase-separated amorphous alloys has been confirmed unambiguously by electromotive force (EMF) measurements and characterized by calorimetric and structural investigations. EMF measurements also allow the direct determination of the chemical potentials of the least noble component and thereby (for binary systems) the Gibbs energy of the amorphous phase. By means of thermodynamic modeling, e.g. by the CALPHAD method, phase diagrams of metastable phases can be calculated for the amorphous phase. These can predict the amorphous phase formation during rapid quenching of the melt and during solid-state reactions. The results demonstrate that the formation of amorphous alloys is strongly determined by the thermodynamics of the undercooled liquid and the amorphous phase.

THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS IN THE RATIONALIZATION OF SOLID-STATE AMORPHIZATION BETWEEN METALS AND III-V SEMICONDUCTORS:</B> Y.A. Chang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706; F.-Y. Shiau, Trace Storage Technology Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan, China; <I>S.-L. Chen</I>, CompuTherm LLC, Middleton, WI 53562; S. Mohney, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802<P>
In addition to binary metal/metal systems, solid-state amorphization reactions have been reported to occur in numerous ternary III-V semiconductor/metal systems such as GaAs/Ni, GaAs/Co, InP/Ni, InP/Pd, InP/Co and InP/Pt. In this presentation a thermodynamic argument will be presented first to rationalize the occurrence of an amorphous phase in a model binary system. This argument will be used next to rationalize solid-state amorphization in III-V semiconductor/metal systems focusing on the GaAs/Co case. In this system, sufficient thermodynamic information is available.

RECENT ADVANCES IN THE THERMOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATION OF SELECTED Al-Ni-R (R=RARE EARTH METALS) ALLOYS:</B> G. Borzone, N. Parodi, R. Ferro, Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Divisione di Chimica Inorganica e Metallurgia, Universit&agrave; di Genova, I-16146 Genova, Italy
<P>
The aluminum-based intermetallic compounds are the subject of growing interest for their combination of properties such as low density, good resistance to corrosion and heat, etc. For the Al-transition metal alloys, we may mention that the addition of rare earths to Al-rich alloys can bring about a significant modification of macro- and microstructure resulting in improvement in strength, thermal stability, etc. Several applications of selected Al-M-R (M-transition metal) alloys for their typical characteristics such as magnetic properties and hydrogen storage capability may be worthy of note. The knowledge of their thermodynamic properties may therefore be useful in gaining information on stable and metastable phases of these systems. To this end, we have begun a systematic study on the reactivity of the Al-R and Al-Ni-R alloys using calorimetric techniques, x-ray diffraction and microscopy analyses. The results so far obtained for selected Al-Ni-R alloy compositions will be illustrated and discussed.

THERMODYNAMIC MODELLING AND APPLICATIONS OF THE Ti-Al-N PHASE DIAGRAM:</B> K. Zeng and R. Schmid-Fetzer, Techn. Universitaet Clausthal, AG Elektronische Materialien, Robert-Koch-Str. 42, D-38678 Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany
<P>
The Ti-Al-N phase diagram has been assessed and a consistent set of thermodynamic functions has been developed. Three ternary line compounds, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/tau.gif">1-Ti3AlN0.56, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/tau.gif">2-Ti2AlN082, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/tau.gif">3-Ti3Al2N2, and the interaction parameters of the ternary solution phases <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">Ti and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">Ti have been modelled. The experimental phase equilibria at 1573K can be well reproduced. Inconsistencies are detected at lower temperatures, which are also related to the observed melting behavior of the ternary phases. These inconsistencies and the current approach to determine the Gibbs energies of the ternary phases are discussed in detail. Applications of the proposed thermodynamic model include the diffusion path of the Ti/AlN contact system at 1473 K, the reactions of Al+TiN powder mixtures in Al-matrix composites and Al/TiN interface reaction.

<P>
The critical thermodynamic evaluation of alloys formed from the components Al, Cu, Mg, Si, Zn to produce technologically important constitution information will be described. Isothermal sections and isopleths relevant to phase formation in commercial alloys will be presented. The use of the evaluated data to investigate phase formation sequences and enthalpy effects during solidification under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions will be discussed and simulations of heat-treatment processes taking into account the influence of diffusion rates on the development of phase constitution will be described.

UNIFIED SOLUTION MODEL FOR BINARY, TERNARY AND HIGHER ORDER METALLIC, CERAMIC SYSTEMS, AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS, POLYMER BLENDS AND FOR PHASE DIAGRAM CALCULATIONS</B>: <I>M. Hoch</I>, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221
<P>
The Hoch-Arsphofen model has been applied to binary, ternary and higher order metallic, ceramic systems, aqueous solutions, polymer blends and used for phase diagram calculations. The model is an expansion of the regular solution model: it assumes that in a binary system the A-B bond properties depend on the surroundings. The model was derived from ternary and quaternary systems, and no ternary or higher order interaction parameters are needed. An equation for Cp(L-s) has been developed, based on Tg, the theoretical glass transition temperature, where, below the melting point, the entropy of the liquid equals that of the solid, and the Gibbs energy difference G(L-s) is a maximum. Examples of all four types of systems are presented.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INTERSTITIAL ATOMS AND VACANCIES IN METALS:</B> <I> Rex B. McLellan</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Rice University, PO Box 1892, Houston, TX 77251-1892
<P>
The statistical mechanics of interactions between dissolved interstitial atoms and lattice vacancies in metals is discussed. Interstitial atoms occupy sites nearest-neighbor to a monovacancy creating &quot;decorated&quot; vacancies. The effect of such clusters on the thermodynamic properties of the solid solution and the kinetics of the migration of both lattice atoms and interstitial solutes is considered. Specific calculations will include C - austenite and systems involving hydrogen in palladium-based binary matrixes.

ENERGETICS OF ALLOY FORMATION WITHIN STATISTICAL THERMODYNAMICS AND ELECTRON THEORY:</B> <I>R.N. Singh</I>, Department of Physics, Sultan Qaboos University, PO Box 36 Al-Khod, Postal Code 123, Oman
<P>
The deviations of the thermo-physical functions from the additive rule of mixing as a function of concentration, temperature and pressure is a key to the understanding of the energetics of alloy formation. Within the framework of statistical thermodynamic model, a suitable link is established between the bulk observable properties and the nature of atomic interactions in strongly and weakly correlated systems. It helps to analyze the role of enthalpic and entropic effects on alloy formation. The implications of basic interactions (i.e. electron-electron, ion-ion and electron-ion) on formation energy are also discussed from electronic theory. Pairwise interactions calculated from the first principle theory are found to have a direct correspondence to the order energy which occurs as a free parameter in various thermodynamic models.

ALUMINUM INDUSTRY/GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP FOR COLLABORATIVE R&amp;D:</B> <I>Hank Kenchington</I>, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, DC 20585
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. Department of Energy signed a contract with the aluminum industry to establish a research partnership for collaborative research and development. The partnership will identify appropriate areas for joint R&amp;D that can improve the quality of life in the United States and promote the manufacture of competitively priced and ecologically sustainable aluminum products. To implement the partnership, DOE will work with the aluminum industry to develop a technology roadmap that delineates and prioritizes the technological needs for global competitiveness into the 21st century.

JOINING ALUMINUM MATERIALS USING ULTRASONIC IMPACTORS:</B> <I>Glenn Freitas</I>, Aztex, Inc., 303 Bear Hill Road, Waltham, MA 02154-1196
<P>
The joining approach being presented here uses ultrasonic impactors to insert steel pins directly to join aluminum to aluminum or aluminum to composite materials. The concept does not require any machining or preparation of the aluminum components to be joined. Using this process, inexpensive mill products, sheet, extrusions, etc. can be used directly without additional machining to create complex structures. More importantly, this process will produce very high performance structures similar to the weight efficiency of co-cured carbon composites at a fraction of the cost.

THERMAL SPRAYING OF ALUMINUM AS AN ADHESIVE BOND PRETREATMENT:</B> <I>Guy Davis</I>, DACCO SCI, Inc., 10260 Old Columbia Road, Columbia, MD 21046
<P>
DACCO SCI, Inc., (DSI) evaluates two-wire arc thermal spray coatings as an adherent pretreatment. This work will build on previous experience of DSI with plasma spray coatings as treatments for aluminum adherents. These treatments exhibit performance equivalent to the best chemical treatments but are environmentally benign. Thermal spray processes generate no gaseous or liquid wastes and minimal solid wastes. Additionally, they are robust processes that are capable of being preformed on localized areas in the field or depot during repair/refurbishment operations. Alternatively, parts may be sprayed in advance and stored indefinitely prior to use. The two-wire arc process is considerably cheaper and less complicated then the plasma spray process.

UTILIZATION OF RECYCLED AND UNRECOVERABLE ALUMINUM SCRAPS IN MANUFACTURING CELLULAR CONCRETE:</B> <I>Jiann-Yang (Jim) Hwang</I>, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931-1295
<P>
In manufacturing cellular concrete, finely divided metallic aluminum powder is used to react with hydroxides, forming minute bubbles of hydrogen gas throughout the concrete mixture. Traditionally, high cost pure aluminum powder is used in manufacturing cellular concrete which greatly increases the cost of the products. To use traditionally unrecoverable aluminum wastes, a pretreatment process will be employed to separate magnetic metal and dirt from the stream and to grind the main stream waste into aluminum powder. The effect of moisture content in the waste on grinding quality will be examined and evaluated. The effects of the amount of recycled aluminum and the alkalies concentration in the mixture will be studied. Finally, the mechanical and physical properties of the cellular concrete will be examined and evaluated.

SOLID-STATE SPRAY FORMING OF ALUMINUM NEAR-NET SHAPES:</B> Ralph Tapphorn, Howard Gabel, Innovative Technology, Inc., P.O. Box 8392, Las Cruces, NM 88006
<P>
Solid-state spray forming (SSF) is a promising new technology for saving energy in the production of aluminum near-net shapes. Because SSF does not require melting of the feedstock, ITI anticipates producing aluminum parts at significantly lower energy input than conventional alternatives require. The light weight, high strength, and recyclable features of these parts will propagate this energy savings through the life of the parts. SSF is potentially applicable to the production of aluminum metal matrix composites, also in near-net shapes; and provides the compelling possibility of producing MMCs with non-traditional strengthening phases, including nonophase particles.

DEGASSING LIQUID ALUMINUM ALLOYS BY ARGON IN CLOSED CIRCUIT</B>: Robert A. Rapp, L.S. Fan, Ohio State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, 116 W. 19th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The large reduction in the solubility of dissolved hydrogen in aluminum as it is solidified to form ingots, strip, sheet or cast products necessitates that the liquid metal is degassed prior to casting. Pure argon is frequently injected into the liquid alloy through a submerged lance or bubbler, so that dissolved hydrogen enters the argon bubble prior to discharge into the environment. This work introduces a proprietary concept to achieve the same argon degassing of liquid aluminum alloys, with recirculation of the argon in a closed loop such that the cost of the argon is saved. In practice, the hydrogen entrained by the argon from the liquid alloy would be oxidized to form H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) by reaction with a fixed bed of copper oxide pellets and the H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) product would be extracted by a desiccator bed. When the reactant bed of copper oxide is mostly reduced to copper and the desiccator approaches saturation, a relay is activated, causing a redirection of the gas flow which replaces the spent reactants with newly regenerated ones.

CLOSED-LOOP NITROGEN-CHLORINE DEGASSING/FLUXING OF LIQUID ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> L.S. Fan, Robert A. Rapp, Ohio State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, 116 W. 19th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The need to degas liquid aluminum alloys to reduce dissolved hydrogen prior to solidification to form any product is indigenous to all aluminum processing plants. Likewise, to produce aluminum sheet and some other products, dissolved sodium and calcium must be fluxed by reaction with chlorine. Today, the combined degassing and fluxing is often achieved by the bubbling of a nitrogen-chlorine gas mixture into the melt, with release of the product HCl and unreacted Cl2 into the environment. This work introduces a proprietary concept to accomplish the degassing/fluxing of aluminum melts by the usual nitrogen-chlorine gas mixture, but with recirculation of the chlorine within a closed-loop system so that it is not released to the environment. Reaction of HCl and Cl2 from the degassing product gases with copper oxide pellets in a fixed bed lead to their conversion to copper chlorides, and the H2O(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">) product is safely vented to the environment. Ambient air is used to regenerate the reactant copper oxide from the product copper chloride.

ENERGY AND OTHER COST SAVINGS THROUGH NOVEL, STATIC DEGASSING IN RECYCLED ALUMINUM PRODUCTION:</B> <I>David A. Larsen</I>, Blasch Precision Ceramics, Inc., 580 Broadway, Albany, NY 12204<P>
A novel method of producing ceramic degassing components through freeze-casting and injection molding is employed to manufacture components used in the production of recycled aluminum metal, where contaminant levels are higher than normal, resulting in lower than normal grade metals. Recycled aluminum degassing operations based on today's standard practice are inadequate for the task, requiring either costly rotary components which require high maintenance, and operating costs, or large pore ceramic porous plugs which fail to deliver the necessary fine gas bubble pattern reliably and continually.

EVALUATION OF A NEW MATERIAL FOR HALL-HEROULT CELL CATHODES:</B> <I>Thomas J. Mroz</I>, Advanced Refractory Technologies, Inc., 699 Hertel Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14207<P>
A new, non-oxide material has recently been identified which exhibits electrical resistance 2 orders of magnitude less than graphite, and which can be formed by reaction hot pressing or sintering at relatively low temperatures. Additionally, this material is easily machined, and exhibits good oxidation resistance and excellent thermal shock resistance. It appears to be a good candidate for Hall cell cathode applications. Additionally, there appears to be an opportunity to inexpensively surface treat this material to obtain TiB2 integral coatings. We will evaluate the corrosion resistance of this material with and without the TiB2 coating and further evaluate the parameters required to produce the TiB2 coating.

DISPOSAL OF HALL-HEROULT CELL POT-LINING</B>: <I>J.R. Divine</I>, ChemMet, Ltd., P.O. Box 4068, West Richland, WA 99353-2309<P>
The proposed disposal process provides an energy efficient mechanism for recovering salts from the pot-lining and disposing of the carbonaceous liner itself. The proposed method is to grind the spent pot-liner into small particles and then oxidize them. The method which appears most likely to be successful is to grind to about 1 mm diameter, heat to about 1300 K in an &quot;inert&quot; atmosphere of CO2, and then react with steam. The resulting mixture of CO and H2 can be used as fuel in a boiler to generate steam, preheat the spent pot-liner, or provide co-generation for feeding electrical power back into the grid or into the aluminum process.

AN ALUMINA CONCENTRATION SENSOR:</B> <I>James Oxley</I>, Oxley Research Inc., 25 Science Park, New Haven, CT 06511<P>
This work concerns development of a novel electroanalytical sensor to monitor the depletion in alumina concentration which occurs during electrowinning of aluminum from molten cryolite-alumina baths. The concept relies on the use of an inert indicator electrode which responds directly to variations in dissolved alumina concentration. The electrical signal thus produced can be used in a control algorithm to enable the automatic feeding of alumina to the bath, thereby avoiding the occurrence of &quot;anode effect&quot;.

<P>AN OVERVIEW OF THE INJECTION OF POWDERS AND DUSTS INTO MOLTEN METALS: </B><I>Gordon A. Irons,</I> Department of Materials Science and Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L7 Canada
<P>
The science and technology of powder injection has evolved from its start in the desulphurization of iron over 20 years ago. The inherent advantages of powder injection are: rapid reaction rate, good mixing, the ability to handle fine materials, flexibility and low capital cost. The fundamental engineering science related to the fluid mechanics of injection, and the associated thermodynamics and kinetics of the processes will be reviewed. Due to the above advantages, this technology is finding application in the recycling of in-plant dusts and other secondary materials, and in the non-ferrous industry. Some of these developments will be highlighted.

This paper describes results obtained from a new and patented control process designed to automate powdered additions via subsurface injection into a molten metal furnace. The process automatically receives spectrometer data, compares it to targeted values and accordingly calculates, weighs and pneumatically feeds the additives into the metal furnace by subsurface powder injection. Current installation and trials indicate alloy savings and improved metal control. Results of injection with many different powders injected in industrial applications are discussed.

<P>FLASH CONVERTING OF MK (CHALCOCITE) CONCENTRATE--AN OVERVIEW:</B> <I>G.J. Morgan</I>, A.A. Shook, J.K. Brimacombe, and G.G.

<P>
Flash converting of MK concentrate (Cu2S) was considered as an option for the process flowsheet modifications at Inco's Copper Cliff operations. The flash converting of chalcocite was known to have problems, such as the generation of large amounts of dust, so a comprehensive research program was undertaken at the Centre for Metallurgical Process Engineering, University of British Columbia to examine the process. This paper is a compilation of the results of the project, some of which have been published elsewhere. The mechanism and kinetics of the combustion of individual particles of MK were determined, and dust generation criteria were established. The flash converting flame was mathematically simulated, and dust generation regions within the flame were identified. Pilot plant trials were conducted, confirming that the dust generation rate could be affected (reduced) by altering the burner configuration, and thus the flame characteristics.

<P>DENSE PHASE PNEUMATIC INJECTION FOR FINE MATERIALS: </B><I>Robert G. Goffin,</I> Paul Wurth Ltd., 3310 South Service Road, Burlington, Ontario L7N 3M6, Canada
<P>
Pneumatic injection of various fine materials such as metallic concentrates, fluxes and fuels into pyrometallurgical vessels has become an important practice. Injection is an evolutionary step from pneumatic conveying - the receiving vessel is now a metallurgical process unit instead of a storage unit. Proper injection system design must integrate conveying, injection, metallurgical process and physical constraints, as well as the limitations of specific material characteristics. Dilute phase pneumatic conveying requires large quantities of conveying gas in order to move material. Load ratios in the order of 10:1 (weight of solid gas:weight of conveying gas) are typical. In order to eliminate the problems associated with dilute phase (including extreme pipeline and component abrasion, excess conveying gas, etc.) steady development has been made in the application of dense phase (load ratios substantially higher than 25:1) pneumatic conveying and injection technology. Load ratio selection is dependent upon many factors including specific material characteristics and system requirements. This paper will outline the advantages of dense phase pneumatic injection technology and will present successful and reliable pyrometallurgical applications.

New developments in the metallurgical industry, such as iron bath smelting processes and pulverised coal injection into blast furnaces involve coal injection and devolatilisation under rapid heating conditions. These new technologies employ coal particle heating rates around 104&#176;C/sec. Under these conditions the volatile matter released cannot be established from standard analysis and this can have a significant effect on the process. For example the volatile matter released, which is in excess of that from standard analysis, may lead to excess gas in the top space of a bath smelter. When the efficiency of the reactor relies on a fine balance of post combustion reactions, the increase in release of volatile matter may lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the reactor. In pulverised coal injection to blast furnaces, the amount of volatiles released, and the time taken for this release, influences the combustion behaviour of the coal and char. In this study, the injection and devolatilisation of three size fractions of various coals into a drop tube furnace was investigated. The surface mean diameters of each size fraction were 92&#181;m, 121&#181;m, and 172&#181;m. Four coal types were investigated, sub-bituminous, bituminous, semi-anthracite and an anthracite. These were injected at temperatures of 1000&#176;C, 1200&#176;C, and 1400&#176;C. The ash content and volatile matter remaining in each of the chars was determined in order to calculate the volatile yield using the ash tracer method and the rate of volatiles release. An apparent activation energy for the release of volatiles was calculated. The results show a strong dependence of the activation energy for volatile release on coal crystallite size, as determined by X-ray diffraction. Hence the crystallite size could be an important characteristic of coals that is significant for coal selection for the new technologies in the metallurgical industry.

<P><B>PREDICTION AND MEASUREMENT OF THE TIME-AVERAGED VELOCITIES OF INERT PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN GAS-STIRRED LIQUID BATHS: </B>H. Pham, D.E. Langberg, <I>M. Nilmani</I>, G.K. Williams Cooperative Research Centre for Extractive Metallurgy, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3052 Australia
<P>
The Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) technique was used to measure the instantaneous velocity distribution of polyvinyl chloride particles suspended in an upright cylindrical water bath (0.218 m diameter) agitated by injection of air through a top-submerged centric lance. The time-averaged particle velocity and kinetic energy distributions were obtained from the instantaneous velocity data. The effects of gas flowrate (3.3 10-5 - 5 10-5 Nm3/s), liquid depth (0.164-0.196 m), fractional lance submergence (60-90%), and particle diameter (50-80 &#181;m) were investigated. The magnitudes of the particle velocities and kinetic energies increased with increasing gas injection rate, and increasing lance submergence. Variation of the liquid depth had minimal influence on the particle behaviour under the conditions studied. Steady state liquid phase flowfield simulations using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics package were combined with a dynamic force balance on individual suspended particles to predict the time-averaged particle velocities. Satisfactory agreement was found between the predicted and measured particle velocities, outside the bubble plume region. The particle velocities were integrated with time to predict the trajectories and residence times of particles introduced into the flowfield at different positions. Particles introduced near the plume region were predicted to have much shorter residence times than particles released near the primary recirculation vortex.

BENEFITS OF MEMBRANE SURFACE FILTRATION IN THE NON-FERROUS INDUSTRY: </B><I>Christine E. Kafka</I>, W L. Gore and Associates, Inc., 101 Lewisville Road, P.O. Box 1100, Elkton, MD 21922-1100
<P>
Stricter particulate emission regulations and the competitive requirements to produce metal as economically as possible are driving the non-ferrous processing industry to focus on cleaner and more efficient technologies. One area of interest is the air cleaning systems. Presently, there are many different air filtration technologies employed by the industry. Fabric filtration systems with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane filters are increasingly being chosen to provide optimum performance over conventional depth filtration. The selection of filtration technology greatly affects the performance of the baghouse and process. The ePTFE membrane surface filtration provides consistently higher airflow and longer filter life, while also providing the additional benefit of the lowest particulate emission of any fabric filtration media. Membrane filtration provides these benefits in concentrate drying, primary and secondary smelter and converter baghouses, with case histories around the world.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND HANDLING OF WET AND DRY C60: </B><I>K. Lozano1</I>, X. Sheng1, A. Gaspar-Rosas2, F. Chibante3, E. V. Barrera1, 1Rice University, Dept.

<P>
The structure-property relationships of C60 dissolved in decahydronaphtalene (decalin) and a petroleum solvent viscous standard (PSVS) were studied. This work was motivated mainly by the interest to improve fullerene dispersion in powder processing by wet methods. Measurements of solubility, density, viscosity and elasticity were conducted varying the concentration level of C60. A Decalin solution was mixed with Cu powder and the C60 dispersion and Cu grain-size growth were evaluated. Decalin can dissolve 1.9 mg/ml of C60 while the PSVS dissolves 0.15 mg/ml. The viscosity behavior shown by both solutions was Newtonian, with a small increase in viscosity as a function of fullerene concentration. The elastic portion of the solvents did not change with fullerene concentration. The samples prepared by wet methods showed less C60 agglomerates. This presentation will also emphasize the aspects of handling the fullerene powder in wet and dry methods. This work was supported by National Science Foundation DMR-9357505.

<P>ON THE IMPROVED FLOWABILITY OF COHESIVE POWDERS BY COATING WITH FINE PARTICLES: </B><I>R. Mei1</I>, J.F. Klausner2, H. Shang1, and E.

Poor flowability of cohesive powders is the source of frequent concern in powder handling in many industrial processes. Coating of fine particles on the surface of primary powder particles can be applied to improve powder flowability. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the effect of coating fine particles on the cohesion force between primary powder particles by extending the JKR theory to include the effect of coating particles on the force-displacement relationship. It is shown that the cohesion force between two primary powder particles in the presence of a fine coating particle is directly proportional to the size ratio of the coating particle to the primary powder particle resulting in a drastic reduction in the cohesion force. Through discrete element simulation of powder flows the improved flowability is demonstrated. The effect of coating on improving the flowability is also quantified by comparing the measured angles of repose at a static condition and the flow rates of the gravity driven flow through a funnel for powders with and without particle coating.

<P>
<P>A packing of particles is an assemblage of particles and is widely encountered in many industries. Porosity or packing density is known to be the simplest and most accessible parameter in characterising particle packing. It is very useful to develop a method for predicting the porosity and related packing properties of particulate mixtures for property and/or process control. Particle characteristics affect porosity mainly via three factors: (dimensionless) particle size distribution, particle shape and absolute particle size, giving various packing systems from the simple (coarse) spherical particle packing to the complicated system involving fine and non-spherical powders. Consequently, the modelling of the relationship between porosity and particle characteristics may be carried out by considering these three factors. This paper presents a mathematical model developed on the basis of some simple and physically sound concepts in this direction, with examples provided to confirm its applicability.

<P>Gas-powder-liquid multiphase-phase flow in packed beds can be found in many industrial applications. One typical example is the flow in the lower part of a modern ironmaking blast furnace with high pulverised coal injection, which includes an upward flow of gas and (unburnt) coal and downward flow of liquid iron and slag in a coke bed. Understanding the mechanisms governing the powder entrapment in packed particles is an important step toward the modelling of such a flow system. This paper presents a study of the mechanisms through a model experiment in which the form and volume of deposits, i.e. the entrapped powder, can be visualised. It is found that the contact point between particles plays an important role in capture of powder, and the presence of a liquid may significantly increase the powder entrapment and lead to a dramatic increase in gas pressure drop. The effects of variables relevant to the blast furnace process, such as liquid properties, gas, powder and liquid flowrates, and the size ratio between (flowing) powder and (packed) particle have been studied, and correlations have been formulated for modelling purposes.

<P>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TECHNIQUE FOR CHARACTERIZING THE SHAPE, SIZE, AND TEXTURE OF METAL POWDER GRAINS: </B><I>B.H. Kaye1</I> , L.C. Paquette2, 1Professor of Physics, 2Research Associate, Department of Physics, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, P3E 2C6
<P>
Computer image analysis continues to develop rapidly and the falling costs and increasing power of personal computers make it possible to characterize the shape, angularities and, for rough texture powder grains, the fractal dimensions. New data on the characterization of various types of metal grains will be presented. Assessment of the size distribution of powders using diffractometers and time of flight spectrometers is making it possible to characterize the shape and size of metal powder grains in real time. Again, new data demonstrating the utility of this type of information for the powder metallurgist will be presented. Some of the newer size characterization equipment uses small quantities of powder samples and new procedures for taking representative samples from free fall tumbler mixers will be reviewed and sampling data presented.

CHARACTERIZING THE FLOW OF METAL POWDERS USING THE CONCEPTS OF FRACTAL GEOMETRY AND CHAOS THEORY TO INTERPRET THE AVALANCHING BEHAVIOR OF A POWDER DEPENDENT ON POWDER GRAIN CHARACTERISTICS:</B><I>B. H. Kaye1, </I>L.C. Paquette2, 1Professor of Physics, 2Research Associate, Department of Physics, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, P3E 2C6
<P>
The avalanching behavior of a portion of powder in a slowly rotating disc can be related to the flow behavior of powder in processing equipment. To interpret the observed avalanching behavior a new data processing procedure has been developed which permits instant visual recognition of shifts in the flow behavior. This can be caused by changes in powder grain structure; additives (such as glidants) and changes in ambient properties (such as humidity). Data on these four metal powders of different size, shape and texture will be presented.

Nanostructured ceramic AlN materials are fabricated using chemical routes. The precursor powders of aluminum hydroxide are synthesized by hydrolysis of aluminum tri sec butoxide. These precursor powders are calcined and subsequently transformed to nanoscale AlN powders by nitriding in an ammonia environment furnace at temperatures to 1100&#176;C. The AlN powders are consolidated to green bodies by cold isostatic pressing. The green bodies are sintered in a nitrogen furnace for densification. Characterization techniques include XRD, TEM, HRTEM, DSC, and surface FTIR. The effects of solvent, pH on the control of particle size, particle size distribution and agglomeration are addressed.

Spray freezing of multicomponent aqueous solutions followed by freeze drying leads to formation of homogeneous salt powders with stable and extensive porous structure. The influence of specific microstructure on the properties of fine powders obtained by thermal decomposition of these precursors remains underestimated. Indeed the decomposition of the native freeze dried salt precursor resulted in the formation of single phase LiCoO2 at T=300&#176;C while breaking the aggregates before decomposition led to multiphase product. In the other case carefully controlled influence on the microstructure of the intermediates allowed us to accelerate 3-5 times the rate of grain growth during annealing of Fe2O3 and BaZrO3 fine powders.

Radio frequency plasma chemical vapor deposition (RFPCVD) method is used to prepare ultrafine Si3N4 powder on a large scale. The characteristics of the RFPCVD method are given. It is pointed out that there are three kinds of mathematical models for the RF plasma generator and RFPCVD reactor: thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and aerosol dynamic models with respective features. Research work on theoretical and technical studies for the preparation of ultrafine Si3N4 powder are given in detail. At last, the existing problems of the RFPCVD technology are given: (1) The thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and technical studies should be combined together. (2) Hydrodynamic modeling should be made for the RF plasma generator and CVD reactor simultaneously. (3) The improvements for preparing the Si3N4 powder should be combined with the aftertreatment of the product and also should be related to its sintered properties. (4) The improvements of the Si3N4 ceramic should be combined with the preparation of composite ceramics or surface modification of Si3N4 particles.

PREPARATION OF COMPOSITE PARTICLES BY RAW MATERIAL SOLUTION INJECTION: </B> <I>Hiroyuki Nakamura</I>*, Yun-Fa Chen+, Kunio Kimura*, Hiroshi Tateyama*, Hideharu Hirosue*, Kyushu National Industrial Institute Japan , +Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, China<P>
Composite particles, which are expected as raw materials for composite, are often prepared by alkoxide method or homogeneous precipitation method. However, using these methods, it seems to be rather difficult to control structure of the coating layer (ex. multi-layered, homogeneously mixed, graduated layered). From this point of view, the presenters tried to prepare composite particles by injecting raw material solution into a dispersion of core particles (diameter: micro meter order). The presenters believe that this method will make it easier to control the structure of coating layer. In this presentation, preparation of alumina-hydrate coated SiC whiskers is investigated. We used SiC whiskers as core particles and aluminum salt (nitrate, chloride, sulfate) solution as raw material solution, relationships between preparation conditions (injection speed, concentration of core particles etc.) and morphology of coated particles were explored. Moreover, application of this method for preparation of double-layer coated particles will be presented.

SYNTHESIS OF ALUMINUM NITRIDE POWDERS USING DC-PLASMA PROCESSING: </B> <I>Paul Prichard</I>, Matthew Besser, Daniel Sordelet, Iver Anderson, Ames Laboratory (USDOE), Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011-3020<P>
Experiments were performed to synthesize AlN powders by reacting Al with N using a conventional dc-plasma as a heat source. Attempts to form AlN powders by feeding Al powder into a nitrogen-rich plasma open to the atmosphere produced mainly aluminum oxide. Subsequent experiments were run inside a chamber which was backfilled with nitrogen. The nitrogen environment suppressed the formation of aluminum oxide, but little AlN was formed by using Al powder as the feedstock material. A furnace and crucible assembly was designed to feed molten Al directly into a convergent nozzle positioned directly at the face of the dc-plasma gun. Powders formed using this arrangement show a significant increase in the level of AlN formation. The presence of AlN was verified by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. Results were dependent upon chamber pressure, plasma velocity and molten liquid feed rate. The experimental parameters, equipment design and results will be reported in detail, and a suggested reaction mechanism will be discussed.

The synthesis of ultrafine alumina and zirconia powders by mechanochemical reaction has been investigated using x-ray diffraction, TEM and DSC measurements. Mechanical milling of AlCl3 or ZrCl4 with CaO resulted in nanoscale mixtures of the starting phases, with no evidence of the occurrence of any reaction during milling. The formation of separated 10-20 nm particles of g-Al2O3 within a CaCl2 matrix occurred after heat treating the as-milled AlCl3/CaO mixture above 350&#176;C. Cubic ZrO2, particles 5-10 nm in diameter, were formed after heat treatment above 300&#176;C. With both reactions, removal of the CaCl2 by-product phase was carried out using an appropriate solvent. Measurements of the effect of heat treatment temperature on crystal structure and particle size will be reported.

SYNTHESIS AND PROPERTIES OF POTASSIUM HEXATITANATE WHISKERS: </B><I>Zuomei Jin,</I> Lisheng Wang, Jifen Huang, Dept. of Metal Materials, Chengdu University of Science and Technology, Chengdu, P.O. Box 610065, Sichuan China
<P>
The optimum conditions for synthesizing potassium hexatitanate whiskers (hereinafter called as PHW) were systematically examined using fast-cooling melt method. The intermediate and final products were determined by x-ray diffraction analysis, SEM and differential thermal analysis. A synthetic mechanism of PHW by melt method was proposed. The physical properties of obtained PHW were measured. A ratio of whisker length to whisker diameter is preferably 50 to 200. A PVC resinous composition containing 10-30% of obtained PHW is believed to show that the mechanical properties, heat resistance and abrasion resistance are much improved. For example, the tensile strength is 1.9 times larger than that of PVC resinous matrix and thermal deforming temperature is raised from 84&#176;C to 120&#176;C.

SYNTHESIS OF TI(N1-xCx) WHISKERS: </B>Niklas Ahlen, <I>Mats Johnsson</I> and Mats Nygren, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Arrhenius Laboratory, Stockholm University, S-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden
<P>
A route for synthesis of Ti(N1-xCx) whiskers (0 &#190; x &#190; 1), in a yield of 70-90 vol% has been established. The whiskers are &#190; 1 &#181;m in diameter and 10-30 &#181;m in length. They are straight and have smooth surfaces. The Ti(N1-xCx) whiskers have been synthesized carbothermally via a Vapour-Liquid-Solid (VLS) growth mechanism in the temperature region 1200-1600&#176;C. The starting materials consisted of TiO2, C, an Ni-catalyst, and NaCl used as precursor for Cl. The synthesis of TiC whiskers are made in an Ar (g) atmosphere while the Ti(N1-xCx) whiskers are prepared in N2 (g) which besides preventing oxidation also acts as nitrogen source for the whiskers. The main impurities in the whisker product are minor amounts of unreacted carbon, oxygen and remnants of the Ni-catalyst. The VLS-mechanism is complex and involve formation of gaseous TiClx species, which are transported to the catalyst. However, the overall reaction is a straightforward carbothermal reduction/nitridation reaction.

RECEPTION OF CERAMIC FIBERS FROM JOINTLY PRECIPITATED HYDROXIDES: </B><I>Maximilian N. Kopylovich</I>, Alexey K. Baev, and Alexander A. Chernik. Department of Analytical Chemistry, Byelorussian State Technological University, 13a Sverdlov Street, Minsk, 220630 Republic of Belarus
<P>
The coprecipitation method is perspective for reception of ceramic fibers. The essence of the method consists of a joint precipitation of hydroxides or salts with the subsequent branch, washing, drying and heating of a precipitate. The joint precipitation of hydroxides has a number of features. The hydroxides of metals can interact at the moment of a joint precipitation that results in occurrence of solid solutions. It was proven that in many systems containing by 2 and more hydrolyzed metal ions under certain conditions the formation of heteronuclear hydroxocomplexes occurs in solutions. The further interaction of specified hydroxopolymers causes formation of complex polynuclear structures reach the size of colloidal particles. The latters are X-ray amorphous and they are a prestructure of the future material. Such prestructure can be transformed into a final crystal product at lower temperature and smaller duration of heat treatment in comparison with oxide technology accepted in manufacture of ceramic fibers at present. It will allow to expand a palette of ceramic fibers and to lower their cost price.

MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES--TECHNIQUES AND REGULATIONS: </B><I>Martin Harper, PhD,</I> SKC, Inc., 863 Valley View Road, Eighty Four, PA 15330
<P>
Measurement of the nature and number of suspended particles in breathing air is used in health effect studies and to demonstrate compliance with government (OSHA, MSHA, EPA) regulations. The characteristics of the aerosol (e.g. fibrous, biological, metaliferous) and the requirements of the regulations govern the choice of technique. Three health-based size distributions are recognized (inhalable, thoracic, and respirable), but the definition of the fractions has varied over time. Current size separation and sampling equipment for aerosols includes impingers, elutriators, filters, impactors, cyclones, and various direct-reading instruments based on, for example, light scattering, or particle motions. Factors which influence the choice include sensitivity, accuracy, portability and ease of use, calibration requirements, cost, and government regulations. Some instruments are well matched to the health-based size fractions, and others less so. The history and current state of regulations will be reviewed, and the types of instruments will be described.

DUST EXPLOSIBILITY PARAMETERS FOR METAL POWDERS: </B><I>C. James Dahn</I>, Safety Consulting Engineers, Inc., 2131 Hammond Drive, Schaumburg, IL 60173
<P>
The processing, manufacture and handling of powdered metals can employ widely varying process conditions which affect the potential for ignition, the explosion output and resultant collateral damages. This paper presents an overview of the factors (i.e., particle size distribution, particle cloud density, degree of turbulence, oxygen content and ambient temperature) which impact the minimum ignition energy requirement and explosive output of metallic powders. Processing conditions which strongly affect the output of an explosion, as measured in terms of maximum pressure achieved and maximum rate of pressure rise, are presented. Parameters influencing the energy requirements for ignition of an explosion will be emphasized. Dust cloud characterization under controlled conditions can be utilized to predict and, when necessary, to minimize powdered metal processing hazards.

<B>CONTROL OF BERYLLIUM POWDER AT A DOE FACILITY: </B><I>Gerald C. Langner</I>, K.L. Creek, R.G. Castro, Industrial Hygiene Section, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Although only a small percentage of the general population and work force will face exposure to airborne beryllium, the effects of this exposure to the individual can be permanent and devastating. One effect, chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a granuloma and fibrotic lung disease with latency, can be developed after inhalation exposures to beryllium. In this study, the principal investigators conducted a hazard characterization of the beryllium powder plasma spray operation at Los Alamos National Laboratory using side-by-side, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) sampling with conventional industrial hygiene techniques. We used results of the sampling data to reevaluate work practices and engineering controls associated with the plasma spray operation. As a consequence, work practices have changed, and new engineering controls and facility design changes will be implemented. These revised engineering controls include modifications to the beryllium spray chamber and design of auxiliary equipment used during routine spray chamber maintenance.

RHENIUM SEVENTY YEARS OLD:</B> <I>Fathi Habashi</I>, Department of Mining and Metallurgy, Laval University, Quebec City, Canada, GIK 7P4
<P>
Rhenium was discovered in Berlin in 1925 by Ida Tacke, Walter Noddack, and Otto Berg. It was isolated in milligram amounts by Ida Noddack (born Tacke) in 1926. The first 100 kg of the metal were produced seventy years ago from carbonaceous copper shist ore (Kupferschiefer) from the Mansfeld District in Germany. The process was so complicated and the price so high that production was discontinued until early 1950 when tungstenrhenium and molybdenumrhenium alloys were prepared. These alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the metal produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry copper ores. The early story of rhenium will be told from personal interviews with Ida Noddack (18961978).

<P>RHENIUM BACKGROUND AND MARKETS:</B> Tom A. Millensifer, Powmet, Inc., 2625 Sewell St., P.O. Box 5086, Rockford, IL 61125
<P>
Rhenium existed as a curiosity with little practical application for it's first nearly 50 years. Use was limited to a few specialty and high temperature alloy applications. In the early 1960's interest in the potential for catalytic use of Rhenium developed and by the early 1970's significant catalytic use had begun. Greater production was required. Leading development of production technology in the Western World was Kennecott Copper Corporation which originated industrial scale recovery techniques. In 1963 Shattuck Chemical in Denver, Colorado installed recovery facilities based on Kennecott's technology. The facilities were followed by recovery at Starck in Germany and Molycorp in Chili. In 1980 Duval Corporation, a subsidiary of Pennzoil, installed recovery facilities and began recovery in mid 1981. Today recovery from Molybdenite exists in the Western World in only three places with one other available but not operating at this time. Recovery from Copper is reported in Japan and Kazakhstan, and also from Copper Smelting in Jianxi Province China as well as at several Molybdenum Roaters in Russian and other areas of the CIS.

<P>MILL PRODUCTS AND FABRICATED COMPONENTS IN RHENIUM METAL AND RHENIUM RICH ALLOYS:</B> Jan-C. Carl&eacute;n, Rhenium Alloys, Inc., P.O. Box 245, Elyria, OH 44036
<P>
For a metal which is produced in quantities around 50 tons per year worldwide, it should be difficult to talk about bulk usage. However, about 90% of the rhenium produced is used for catalysts and as an alloying element in nickelcobaltbase superalloys. This paper deals with mill products based on powder metallurgy production of rhenium and molybdenumrhenium and tungstenrhenium alloys. Rhenium is a metal which workhardens very quickly in coldworking and which cannot be hotworked because of hotshortness and poor oxidation resistance. This makes plastic forming of rhenium a very delicate process. Rhenium cannot be machined using conventional methods but other means of making complicated shapes have been developed. Alloys between rhenium and tungsten and rhenium and molybdenum have their best properties at or close to the solubility limit for rhenium in each metal, which may create problems with formation of a brittle, intermetallic phase (sigma phase). However, these alloys are much easier to form using plastic hot and cold forming. They can also be formed into various shapes using regular machining methods. Means of avoiding or eliminating the negative effect of sigma phase are briefly discussed. Finally the industrial usage of mill products and assintered products of rhenium and its alloys with molybdenum and tungsten is discussed. These materials have found many challenging applications in space, defense, electronic, energy, scientific instruments and other hightech industries.

<P>THE PERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RHENIUM PRODUCTION IN RUSSIA:</B> Albert D. Besser, A.V. Peredereev, State Research Center of Russia, 13 Acad. Korolyov Street, 129515 Moscow, Russia
<P>
The rhenium's production base in Russia is based on the processing of the concentrates of the effective tungsten-molybdenum mines (Zhirkenskyi, Sorskyi, Tyrnyauzskyi) and opening up of the new ones (Bugdainskyi, Aksukskyi and others), as well as on the recovery of rhenium from the gases during the burning of the shales. The substantial content of rhenium and of some other rare components in the volcanic slags has been revealed. The extraction technology has been developed. The processing technology of the secondary rhenium-containing raw materials and of the intermediate products has been developed and realized in the industrial conditions. The technologies concerning the extraction of more than 90% of rhenium from the molybdenite concentrates following the pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes have been developed and are ready now for the industrial realization.

<P>EXTRACTION OF RHENIUM FROM MOLYBDENITE CONCENTRATES:</B> Mahesh C. Jha, William A. May, Entech Molybdenum Inc., 5950 McIntyre Street, Golden, CO 80403-7499
<P>
<P>By-product molybdenite concentrates from copper mines are the most important source of rhenium. The rhenium content is low, generally in the few hundred ppm range. Almost all of these concentrates are roasted to technical grade molybdic oxide, the most common molybdenum product sold commercially. Rhenium oxide is volatilized at high roasting temperatures and condensed downstream at lower temperatures, eventually reporting to the scrubber liquor as a dilute solution. This paper reviews several hydrometallurgical approaches that have been used commercially and for researched and recommended to recover the rhenium from such dilute solutions. The methods include ion exchange, solvent extraction, selective leaching/precipitation, and crystallization for concentration and purification steps. Ammonium perrhenate is typically the end product.

<P>
<P>Since its discovery by the German investigators W. Noddack, Ida Tacke and 0. Berg in 1925 and, at about the same time, by the Czechs J. Heyrovsky and V. Dolejsek, and the British investigators J.G.F. Druce and F.H. Loring, rhenium, element of atomic number 75 has gradually established a niche for itself in the industrial world. With the technology of rhenium now well established, its further technical progress may be impeded for the lack of a ready means to recover it from scrapped sources. This conference, being the next to follow the Rhenium Conference in l963, affords an opportunity to review the approaches published for the recovery of the element rhenium from some of the diverse products in which it has played a unique and very special ro1e.

<P>
<P>The presence of radiogenic osmium-187 formed by by-fussion of rhenium-187 is the specific characteristic of some rhenium -containing source. The technology for the recovery of rhenium and osmium from sulfuric acid scrub solutions formed by wet gas purifying in pyrometallurgical processing of sulfide polymetallic ores was developed. The technology is based on extraction and sorption techniques following preliminary conversion of the metals into the optimal chemical species. The technology ensures quantitative recovery, concentration and separation of rhenium and osmium, production of commercially viable concentration of the elements. <P>

RECYCLING OF RHENIUM:</B> D.V. Drobot, V.I. Bukin, Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technologies, Pr. Vernadskogo 86, 117571 Moscow, Russia
<P>
The aim of the investigation is the generalization of the published results according of rhenium extraction from secondary materials. Such materials can be classified as binary W-Re and Mo-Re alloys; several composition Ni-Re alloys; Al-Pt-Re catalysts and other Re-containing secondary products. The range of technological processes is very mice and depends on forms and Re concentration in secondary materials. For Re extraction from binary alloys can be used processes including interaction with KNO3 or oxidation. In the last case it may be obtained volatile Re207. Purification can be done by rectification Re2O7. The full extent of Re extraction from such materials is 92-94%. Combination of the chlorination process with solvent extraction allows to obtain Re metal with extent of extraction ~92%. Re can be obtained from Mo-Re, W-Re alloys by means of electrochemical process (alkali solutions) or H:SO. solutions (Ni-Re alloys). For the production of the pure Re products it's necessery to use combination with solvent extraction or sorbtion. Complex Re and Pt extraction metals from A1-Pt-Re containing catalyst is the most important problem. There are known two methods, which differ at the first step: annealing with Na2CO3 or annealing in oxidation atmosphere are possible. Extents of Re and Pt extraction are 90 and 92%.

BEHAVIOR &amp; RECOVERY OF RHENIUM DURING THE CONVERSION OF MOLYBDENUM CONCENTRATES AND MISCELANEOUS TYPES OF THE SECONDARY RAW MATERIALS: </B>N.N. Rakova, L.V. Miakisheva, K.N. Yegorychev, V.S. Strizhko, The Moscow State Institute of Steel &amp; Alloys, Moscow, Russia
<P>
The definite works to create scientific foundations and the technology for the recovery of rhenium from the primary and secondary raw materials were initiated in the 60's at the Chairs of the rare-earth metals &amp; powder metallurgy led by the Distinguished Metallurgist of Russia, professor A. N. Zelikman. 1. The molybdenum concentrates- one of the prime sources to recover rhenium along with the sulfide copper and copper/moly raw materials. The researches have been tested to investigate a behavior of rhenium during roasting process of the molybdenum concentrates and during the attack by the nitrogen acid. 2. The researchers have been tested with form and mechanism of extraction of molybdenum and rhenium from sulfur acid and nitrogen/sulfur acid solutions of different compositions. During the elaborations of the extraction methods of distribution and the recovery it has been taken into account the differences in the forms of molybdenum and rhenium presence in the acid atmospheres and it has been suggested to utilize the neutral, anion- and cation exchange extragents. 3. The processes of the deep cleaning of the rhenium combination through trihydroxychloride, having the below melting and flashing temperature have been developed. The purity of the recovered ammonium perrhenate and metallic rhenium is exceeding their purity during the production and refinery by the other methods. 4. Some methods have been tested to regenerate rhenium, tungsten, molybdenum from the wastes of W-Re &amp; Mo-Re alloys with further treatment of the mixtures of chlorides of tungsten and rhenium by the water with the presence of oxidant and oxidation of alloys by means of oxygene and sublimation of rhenium oxide.

<P>
<P>This report submits data of high-efficiency methods for rhenium recovery from secondary raw materials of various types, such as exhausted platinum-rhenium catalysts and scrap of rhenium-containing molybdenum, tungsten and nickel based alloys. Developed methods are used on a commercial level at industrial enterprises of Russia and CIS. A process for selectively recovering rhenium from exhausted Pt-Re catalysts includes next steps: roasting, acid- or alkali-assisted leaching, ion-exchange recovery or rhenium from the solution and preparing high-purity ammonium perrhenate (99.99%). Results of developing commercially applicable methods are useful for rhenium recovery from scrap of rhenium-containing alloys.

<P>
<P>Radiometric correction and interpolation methods have been worked out for rhenium determination with extraction of the tetraphenylphosphonium complex into dichlorethane. Radiotracer 188Re (16,9 h) is obtained in 188Re-generator which is a glass column filled with aluminium oxide with a parent isotope 188W (69, 4 d) adsorbed firmly. The isotope 188Re formed is eluted from the generator by 0,9% solution of sodium chloride. Liquid scintillation counting was used. The method allows to determine from 1 to 100 mg of rhenium (VII) in analyzed probe. The relative standard deviation is 0.05-0,09 over the whole concentration range.

The thermal decomposition of the organic derivatives of rhenium (Re4O2(OMe)16 (I), ReMoO2(OMe)7 (II), Re4-xWxO2 (OMe)16 (III), Re2O5(acac)2 (IV)) in air at temperatures below 400&#176;C leads in case of I, III and IV to the oxide powders containing fine particles (40-60 &Aring;) with ReO3 type structure included into amorphous matrix, while in case of II a mixture of ReO3 and MoO3 phases was obtained. In an inert atmosphere (N2, Ar) at 300-400&#176;C. I also gives a ReO3 phase, II and III give a pseudocubic phase with Re1-xMxO2 composition (M=Mo, x &#190; 0.25), while IV provides spherical amorphous particles (~1 &#181;m size) of rhenium metal. The reduction of I-III in hydrogen atmosphere leads to formation of single-phase metal product (with the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">-phase alloy structure) at the temperature about 300-400&#176;C.

SOFT CHEMISTRY ROUTE TO RHENIUM-BASED MATERIALS:</B> V.G. Kessler, Moscow State University; Moscow, Russia; G.A. Seisenbaeva, D.V. Drobot, Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technologies, Pr. Vernadskogo 86, 117571 Moscow, Russia<P>
The so called soft chemistry approach is usually based on hydrolytic or pyrolytic decomposition of the complexes of metals with organic ligands. The methoxides of rhenium (I), rhenium and molybdenum (II) and rhenium and tungsten (III) were prepared by anodic oxidation of rhenium metal in methanol in the presence of LiCl as electrolyte and methoxides of countermetals. Acetylacetonate, Re2O5(acac)2 (IV) was obtained by interaction of re2O7 and Hacac in toluene. I and III are insoluble in common organic solvents and air stable in contrast to highly soluble and air and moisture sensitive II. IV is insoluble in hydrocarbons and dissolves in ethers with decomposition. All these compounds are volatile at reduced pressure and decompose in inert atmosphere into mixed low-valent oxides or, in case of IV, into rhenium metal.

Thermal behaviour of binuclear halogenated and halogencarboxylated Re26+ clusters, synthesized according to elaborated procedures, is studied. It is shown, that the last stage of thermal distribution of the substances in vacuum or inert atmosphere is formation of metal rhenium with content of contaminants 0,001-0,01%. Method of obtaining of composite material of &quot;metal-oxide&quot; type is elaborated, providing the best combination of thermophysical and mechanical properties in wide temperature intervals.

The catalytic properties of supported rhenium were widely investigated in the reactions of de, hydrogenation, hydrogenation of hydrocarbons and reforming of petrol fractions. Lowpercentage bimetallic supported catalysts containing rhenium and palladium have been developed. A world first publication of these results were in 1960's - a little bit earlier than known Pt - Re reforming catalysts. An effective catalyst, rhenium heptasulfide has been found in the chemical synthesis of S - and N - containing heterocycles compounds. It is a specific selective catalyst for the hydrogenation of the pyridine ring without affecting the benzene ring in aryl-substituted pyridines, including those containing silicon, isoquinolines, annelated pyridine and condensed aromatic compounds. The process of hydrogenation in the presence of alcohols is going on along with N - alkylation on rhenium heptasulfide. Selective hydrogenation of various number of physiologically active substances, containing a pyridine ring could afford some alkaloids and their analogs.

Binuclear rhenium clusters are the first examples of inorganic substances, which contain multiple metal-metal bond, that is the reason of some special (unique) properties of these compounds. Mechanism of formation of Re3+ clusters is thoroughly studied by us that became the base of elaboration of new technological methods of synthesis of different types of binuclear Re26+ clusters. On the base of accomplished investigations the perspective of binuclear rhenium clusters application is shown as precursors for obtaining of rhenium and new inorganic materials on it's basis, catalysis and promotors of catalytic systems among them.

This report presents the results of studies the process of electrodialysis of rhenium-containing solutions. It contains experimental data obtained by studying transport of rhenium and impurity elements through different membranes and selection of optimal electromembrane system, electrode materials and ion-exchange membranes. The received data have allowed to develop methods of electrodialysis conversion of potassium perrhenate to superpure ammonium perrhenate and preparation of highpurity concentrated perrhenic acid by treatment of contaminated salts. It is found that the method of electrodialysis is very efficient for recovery of rhenium from complicated sulphuric-acid solutions containing molybdenum, iron, zinc, lead and other elements. The described methods are successfully used at Russian enterprises.

PROGRESS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY OF RHENIUM:</B> Ludmilla V. Borisova, V.I. Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 117975 Moscow, Kosygin Str. 19, Russia<P>
Rhenium speciations in various solutions, which are important for process and analytical chemistry have been studied for many years. Model systems, containing Rhenium, different ligands and reductors, equilibrium diagrams of Rhenium compounds were studied. Analytical forms of Rhenium compounds and their properties (oxidative-reductive, complexability, catalytical and etc.), their composition, structure, mechanism and reaction kinetics with the used of WMS, IR, ESR, NMR and kinetic spectroscopy methods were revelated. Effective analytical systems were discovered on the basis of these investigations. Perspective methods of optical and potentiometrical sensors, catalytic methods for cone. of alkaline and acid medias with detection limit down to 0.001 &#181;gRe/ml, coulometric method for mg Re determination, ICPAES, luminescence, thermochromatographical, spectrophotometric, ESR and other methods were developed. Some of them are in use as FIA detectors. New sorbents, watersoluable polymers with membrane filtration, electrodialysis and electromigration appeared to be the base for effective isolation and preconcentration of Rhenium. Express-testing methods, based on the catalytic properties of &quot;unusual&quot; state of oxidation Rhenium - Re (VI), were created and applied for analytical control on several manufactures (limit of detection up to 0.001 &#181;g/ml). The developed methods comprise the basis of analytical control during the reworking of Rhenium-containing ores, technological rests, waste Re-Pt catalysators, volcanic products from Kurila Islands, being used in field conditions, and also for geochronology by Re/Os isotop ratio.

JOINING AND FABRICATING RHENIUM USING EXPLOSIVE METAL WORKING TECHNIQUES:</B> Donald J. Butler, Sr. Project Engineer, Northwest Technical Industries, Inc., 2249 Diamond Point Road, Sequim, WA 98382
<P>
Rhenium has many unique and interesting properties, but some of those same properties make Rhenium difficult to fabricate and weld. Explosive metal working also has some interesting capabilities. Northwest Technical Industries, under contract from the NASA Lewis Research Center, has been successful using the explosive welding technique to join Rhenium to metals such as Tantalum, Molybdenum, TZM Molybdenum, Vanadium and C 103 Niobium. This paper will describe the explosive welding process and present the results of the work that has been completed with Rhenium. Also, this paper will describe how explosives can be used to form metal parts and explore the potential of using explosive metal forming techniques with Rhenium.

STATE OF THE ART FABRICATION PROCESSES FOR IRIDIUM/RHENIUM THRUST CHAMBERS:</B> <I>R. Tuffias</I>, Ultramet, 12173 Montague St., Pacoima, CA 91331
<P>
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been used to fabricate rhenium liquid rocket combustion chambers since 1977. CVD iridium was first applied to rhenium chambers for high temperature oxidation protection in 1984. Since that time, CVD iridium/rhenium (Ir/Re) chambers have been successfully hot-fire tested at various facilities in both nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH) and oxygen/hydrogen (O2/H2) bipropellants, at mixture ratios ranging from 4 to 17, for a total of nearly 200 hours. An alternate processing method is to form the rhenium by powder metallurgy and apply the iridium by electroplating. Hot-fire testing of this processing method to date includes 43 seconds in NTO/MMH and approximately 11 hours in O2/H2 at a mixture ratio of about 3, an oxidizing potential that may actually be benign to unprotected rhenium. This paper will discuss alternate processing methods and their relationship to fabricating Ir/Re combustion chambers, as well as test methods for evaluating their efficacy.

DEVELOPMENT OF BONDED RHENIUM/Nb-1%Zr TUBING FOR THE SP-100 SPACE NUCLEAR REACTOR</B>: Michael Kangilaski, Advanced Methods and Materials, 1798 Technology Drive, #251, San Jose, CA 95110; E.D. Sayre (retired); D.C. Wadekamper, T.J. Ruffo, General Electric Company, San Jose, CA
<P>
The SP-100 Space Nuclear Reactor design required a rhenium barrier between the uranium nitride nuclear fuel and the niobium alloy cladding. For higher strength and thermal performance it was deemed desirable to metallurgically bond the rhenium tube to the Nb-1%Zr tube. The bonding was achieved by brazing both ends of the rhenium and Nb-1%Zr tubes with a special braze adapter and then hot isostatically pressing (HIP) the brazed assembly. A considerable amount of effort went into developing a two stage HIP cycle for the bonding. A relatively low pressure was chosen in the first stage to assure that the weaker Nb-1%Zr tube collapsed uniformly onto the rhenium tube without any deformation occurring in the stronger rhenium tube. Avoidance of deformation in the rhenium was necessary because rhenium has low ductility at the HIP'ing temperature of 1350&#176;C. In the second stage the temperature and pressure were increased to assure metallurgical bonding of the rhenium and Nb-1%Zr tube.

<P>
In the late 1 970s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) contracted Ultramet to provide oxidation protection for a carbon composite rocket engine thrust chamber using the liquid bipropellant fluorine/hydrazine, an application for which rhenium was selected. In the late 1990s, the first rhenium thrust chamber will fly in space. This paper will discuss the period between these two milestones and those that made it possible.

DIRECTED LIGHT FABRICATION OF RHENIUM COMPONENTS:</B> John O. Milewski, Dan J. Thoma, Gary K. Lewis, Materials Science and Technology Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 1663, MS G770, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Directed Light Fabrication (DLF) is a direct metal deposition process that fuses powder, delivered by gas into the focal zone of a high powered laser beam to form fully dense nearnet shaped components. This is accomplished in one step without the use of molds, dies, forming, pressing, sintering or forging equipment. DLF is performed in a high purity inert environment free from the contaminants associated with conventional processing such as oxide and carbon pickup, lubricants, binding agents, cooling or cleaning agents. Applications using rhenium have historically been limited in part by its workability and cost. This study demonstrates the ability to fuse rhenium metal powder, using a DLF machine, into free standing rods and describes the associated parameter study. Microstructural comparisons between DLF deposited rhenium and commercial rhenium sheet product is performed. This research combined with existing DLF technology demonstrates the feasibility of forming complex rhenium metal shapes directly from powder.

THE IMPACT OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF RHENIUM ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN</B>: A.J. Sherman, A.J. Fortini, B.E. Williams, R. Tuffias, Ultramet, 12173 Montague St., Pacoima, CA 91331
<P>
Pushed by extreme aerospace requirements, exotic materials with unusual properties are being pressed into service. One such material is rhenium. With a density of 21 g/cm3, it is an unlikely material for structural applications, but with an ultimate strength of 20,000 psi at 2000&#176;C, it is the strongest metal at this temperature and comparable in strength to carbon composites up to 2500&#176;C. In order to design structural parts, it is necessary to be able to model their load/ deflection relationship. Such analysis typically assumes that the material is elastic and conforms to Hooke's Law (stress being linearly proportional to strain). When the material becomes inelastic or plastic, failure is assumed to occur, since a permanent deformation takes place This limit is referred to as the yield strength. Typical yield strengths for engineering materials such as steel are roughly 60-80% of the material's ultimate strength. For these materials, then, a linear analysis permits a design range up to 60-80% of the ultimate capability of the material. As long as the material is operated in this range, the relationship between stress and strain remains constant. Rhenium, on the other hand exhibits a &quot;classical yield strength&quot; that can be as low as 10% of its ultimate strength, and its stress-strain relationship varies based on its previous stress history. If a structural design is based on this classical yield strength, 90% of the capability of the material is effectively discarded. Room temperature yield strength data for CVD (chemically vapor deposited) rhenium have included values as high as 45,000 psi and as low as 8,000 psi. Rocket engine designers are currently in a quandary as to the meaning of this data and how to use it to design components. This paper will discuss some of the strength data and present alternatives.

MATERIALS PROPERTY TEST RESULTS OF RHENIUM:</B> <I>Melvin L. Chazen</I>, TRW Space &amp; Technology Division, One Space Park, Bldg. 01-1050, Redondo Beach, CA 90278
<P>
The use of rhenium as a material of construction for high performance liquid apogee/ perigee or delta-V engine applications is very beneficial as the engine performance is less limited by operating wall temperatures due to the performance. Rhenium has a very high melting point (&gt;5700F) but does require protection from oxidation from the products of combustion. Iridium has been demonstrated as a successful high temperature protective coating (melting point &gt;4400P). There are two methods of producing rhenium thrust chambers for high performance engines which have been successfully demonstrated which are chemical vapor deposition of iridium lined rhenium and powder metallurgy rhenium coated with iridium. An investigation was conducted to determine the material properties of both CVD and PM rhenium which was sponsored by NASA-LeRC on the SSRT program. Material property tests consisted of tensile, ultimate, modulus and low cycle fatigue at room temperature, 1500F and 25OOF with a minimum number of tensile tests at 2700-3500F and high temperature creep at 3000F This paper presents these results which indicate that both CVD and FM rhenium are usable for flight engines. In addition a summary of the results of engine tests with experimental PM rhenium will be presented.

JOINING OF RHENIUM AND ITS ALLOYS:</B> <I>Sunder S. Rajan</I>, Hughes Aircraft Company, Electron Dynamics Division, 3100 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, CA 90509-2999
<P>
The processing parameters used to join rhenium and selected alloys containing rhenium are described. Resistance and laser welding as well as brazing processes as applied to these materials are reviewed. The metallurgical factors governing the choice of the process parameters and their influence on structural integrity are illustrated. The influence of alloy selection, use of proper filler materials and the factors governing their selection are reviewed. Experience has shown that pure rhenium, MolyRhenium and Tungsten/Rhenium alloys can be successfully joined by either welding or brazing processes.

STRESS/RUPTURE STRENGTH OF RHENIUM AT EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURES: </B><I>B. Fischer,</I> D. Freud, Jena Polytechnic, Tatzendpromenade 1 b, D-07745 Jena, Germany; D. Lupton, W.C. Heraeus, GmbH, Heraeusstrasse 12-14, D-63450 Hanau, Germany
<P>
For the safe high-temperature use of rhenium we have the task of measuring the stress/rupture strength at extremely high temperatures. For stress/rupture tests on high melting metals we designed and built a test system that allows measurements to be made at temperatures up to 3,000&#176;C under an inert atmosphere. Using this test unit we determined stress/rupture diagrams of rhenium in several material conditions in the range of 2,100&#176;C to 3,000&#176;C. The discussion of the measured values is based on me/allographic test results, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of rhenium samples after the stress/rupture tests, the determination of trace impurities using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and the results of the residual gas analysis of rhenium.

INFLUENCE OF COLD ROLLING ON PLASTIC RESPONSE OF PM AND CVD RHENIUM</B>: G. Subhash, B.J. Koeppel, Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics Department, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
Plastic response of rhenium (Re) produced by powder metallurgy (PM) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was investigated under uniaxial compression. The PM Re was also cold rolled by 50% and 80% reduction (denoted as PM50 and PM80, respectively) in thickness. Both cold rolled and CVD Re have been found to have a strong basal texture. Cylindrical specimens from the above four types of Re (i.e., PM, PM50, PM80 and CVD) were subjected to uniaxial compressive loads in the range of strain rates from 1x10-3 s-1 to 9.5 x 103 s-l. Low strain rate experiments were performed in an Instron machine and high strain rate experiments were performed in a split Hopkinson pressure bar. The deformed specimens were metallographically prepared and etched to study microstructural changes and identify the micromechanisms of deformation. Rhenium exhibited a two stage hardening in its plastic response. It revealed a high strain hardening rate and a strong strain rate sensitivity of flow stress. Increased cold work in the PM Re resulted in an increase in the initial yield stress with a concurrent reduction in the hardening rate and failure strain. CVD Re exhibited a distinctly higher hardening rate and ultimate flow stress than the above cold rolled PM Re. After accumulating a certain amount of plastic strain, the deformation in the specimens localized leading to formation of shear bands at an angle to the loading axis. Fracture immediately followed the shear bands. Twinning was found to be a dominant deformation mode in both PM and CVD Re. Extensive twinning was observed in larger grains of CVD Re. Twins in fine &quot;rained PM specimens were less common and occurred primarily in the regions close to the shearband. Based on the experimental results and microscopic investigations, the micromechanisms of deformation responsible for the observed behavior of Re will be discussed.

STEADY STATE CREEP RATES OF W-4Re-0.32HfC:</B> John J. Park, MS E506, Los Alamos Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545; Dean L. Jacobson, Dept. of Chem, Bio. and Materials Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-6006
<P>
Second phase particle-strengthened tungsten alloy, tungsten-4w/o rhenium-0.32w/o hafnium carbide (W-4Re-0.32HfC), was creep-tested at temperature ranges of 2200 to 2400K and stress ranges of 40 to 70 Mpa in a vacuum of better than 1.3 x 10-6 Pa (1 x 10-8 torr). The resulting steady state creep rates were applied to three particle-strengthened creep models and compared. The three creep models were Ansell-Weertman, Lagneborg, and Roesler-Arzt. None of the three models precisely predicted the steady state creep rates of W-4Re-0.32HfC. However, the recovery creep model of Lagneborg qualitatively fit the creep rates.

TEMPERATURE AND LOAD DEPENDENCE ON THE HARDNESS OF ROLLED RHENIUM SHEETS BEFORE AND AFTER ANNEALING:</B> K. Peter, D.

<P>
The microhardness of rolled rhenium sheets was determined as a function of indentation load and temperature. Sheets of rhenium were produced from rhenium metal powder by pressing, presintering and sintering, followed by cold rolling. After a production anneal to define the structure of the starting material, sheet samples were deformed using cold rolling to about 30% strain in 5% deformation increments without intermediate annealings. One of the deformed samples was annealed at 1600&#176;C for 20 minutes. The temperature dependence of the microhardness between room temperatures and 900&#176;C (using 50&#176; increments) was studied using a Nikon Model QM hot hardness tester equipped with a Vickers indentor. The load dependence of the microhardness was investigated using both a Vickers anda Knopp indentor, and the indentation size effect (ISE) was best explained using the normalized Meyer's law. The hardness of the annealed rhenium sheet approached that of the as-rolled sheets at large indentation loads because of workhardening under the indentor during indentation. The hardness at &quot;zero load&quot; (obtained from extrapolation of the load dependence of the hardness) suggests that the hardness is controlled by two different mechanism having different thermal activation. The activation energy of the mechanism controlling the hardness at low temperatures is approximately 0.02 eV whereas that at high temperatures is approximately 0.5 eV. The transition temperature between the two controlling mechanisms occurs at about 250C.

A REVIEW OF THE INTERACTION OF COLD WORK AND ANNEALING IN THE PROCESSING OF RHENIUM:</B> O.S. Es-Said, Mechanical Engineering Department, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles,CA 90045; R.H. Titran, NASA Lewis Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, Mail Stop 49-1, Cleveland, OH 44135
<P>
Twinning is a dominant deformation mode in both PM and CVD rhenium. Although severe work hardening occurs during cold rolling, extensive twinning enables rhenium to retain moderate ductility. It is believed that as the deformation process progresses, twinning becomes the predominate mode contributing to the plastic deformation of rhenium. At all deformations, the hardness and strength of rhenium decreases at annealing temperatures corresponding to the temperature of the onset of recrystallization. It is known that the recrystallization temperature of rhenium decreases with increasing amounts of cold work, from 1750&#176;C for 5% deformation to 1200&#176;C for 40-60% deformation. This strong dependence exist because the nucleation of recrystallization occurs at the intersection of twin crystals and growth proceeds on the bases of the twins. When a polycrystalline material is deformed, the individual grains tend to orient themselves so that the active slip systems become more favorably oriented with respect to the direction of the principal strain. This leads to crystallographic anisotropy or preferred orientation. In a recent study, the effect of rolling mode on PM rhenium was evaluated. Samples rolled at a 45&#176; direction showed a higher work hardening rate than samples rolled along the width and length of rolled sintered bars. This paper will review the interactions of cold work and annealing on the work hardening, recrystallization, and texture of rhenium.

SOLID SOLUTION MOLYBDENUM-RHENIUM ALLOYS:</B> Lynn B. Lundberg, Materials Consultant, 2832 W. 33rd N., Idaho Falls, ID 83402; Boris D. Bryskin, Rhenium Alloys, Inc., P.O. Box 245, Elyria, OH 44036
<P>
It has been known for many years that the brittleness commonly seen in commercial-pure molybdenum around room temperature can be greatly reduced or eliminated by alloying with rhenium within the solubility range fro rhenium in molybdenum. Molybdenum-based solid solution alloys with rhenium represent a technically important class of refractory metal alloys whose behavior is reviewed in this paper. Mechanical and physical properties are reviewed as well as the fabrication characteristics of the alloys. Data from the vast amount of research performed on molybdenum-rhenium alloys in the former Soviet Union and more recently in Russia are referenced, summarized and reviewed. For the area of advanced materials' applications such analysis is appropriate to make intelligent decisions on how to proceed.

AN OVERVIEW OF W-Re ALLOYS FOR TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT APPLICATIONS</B>: D.A Toenshoff, R.D. Lanam, Engelhard-CLAL, 700 Blair Road, Carteret, NJ 07008
<P>
Two Tungsten-Rhenium alloy pairs are the predominant combinations used in the measurement of temperatures up to 2400&#176;C and higher under protective inert or vacuum conditions. These alloy pairs are W-3Re vs. W-25Re and W-SRe vs. W-26Re. Other combinations are used in regional areas or for special applications. These include W vs. W-25Re and W-5Re vs. W-20Re. A historical review of the materials and the evolution of their use will be given. A discussion of alternate materials e.g. Ir vs. Ir-40Rh to measure high temperatures will be included. The effect of composition and environment on the EMF characteristics will be summarized. The future use of W-Re alloys for temperature measurement applications will be projected.

<P>
The tungsten sheets made by using the powder metallurgy method displayed low plasticity and were apt to delamination in the rolling plane. In order to improve plasticity of the sheets and suppress delamination the additions of the W-Re and HfO powders were employed. On the basis of such compositions the tungsten sheets were obtained which were plastically deformed at 223K. That sheets manifested the fracture toughness in the rolling plane by factor of five higher as compared with the initial sheets.

RHENIUM AND IRIDIUM:</B> Evan K. Ohriner, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6083<P>
Rhenium is used together with the metal iridium in a number of applications. Iridium has been used as coating for rhenium rocket thrusters and as an oxidation-resistant coating in a number of other applications. The high strength of rhenium at elevated temperature is combined with the oxidation resistance and high melting point of iridium. The use of the two metals together is advantageous due to the absence of any stable intermediate compounds. Coating life and properties are effected by solubility and diffusion rates. Rhenium and iridium alloying additions both improve the ductility of tungsten. The high solubility of rhenium in iridium is also being taken advantage of to produce iridium-based materials with a reduced electron work function. The uses of rhenium in conjunction with iridium are discussed. Managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research under contract DE-AC05-96OR22464 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING COMPLEX SHAPE PARTS FROM RHENIUM POWDER:</B> Eugene P. Kratt, Victor N. Samarov, Laboratory of New Technologies, PO Box 31, 103001 Moscow, Russia,; Boris D. Bryskin, Rhenium Alloys, Inc., P.O. Box 245, Elyria, OH 44036<P>
The research was aimed at developing the parameters of the process of manufacturing hollow parts from rhenium and rhenium alloy powders. With this purpose, the hot isostatic pressing technique was proposed. Tool design and choice of material for the tool were the main problems of the research. On the basis of the fulfilled experiments a rational scheme of manufacturing hollow complex shape parts with minimal allowances was developed. the parameters of this scheme are made the basis of the technology of manufacturing rocket engine nozzle type parts.

PREPARATION OF TEFLON PIPES WITH METALLIZED LAYER:</B> E.G. Rakov, D. Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, Miusskaya Sq. 9, Moscow 125047, Russia
<P>
The method of deposition of thin rhenium layers on inner wall of teflon pipes (tubes) by means of filling the pipes by volatile rhenium compound and subsequent chemical reduction of this compound inside teflon pores was developed. The method allows to diminish permeability of teflon for gases or liquids and to change its electric properties: the inner layer becomes electroconductive. Such teflon pipes and details are necessary for neutralization of static electric charges in some devices. The depth of metallized layer, as it was shown by microscopic examination of pipe cross sections, did not exceed some tenth of millimeter. The method allows to deposit-metallized layers of definite configuration.

DEVELOPMENT OF A METALLIC RADIOACTIVE RHENIUM SOURCE FOR THE TREATMENT OF RESTENOSIS AFTER ANGIOPLASTY:</B> Urs Hafeli, Eric Lee, Jay Ciezki, Roger Macklis, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Desk T28, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195<P>
Radioactive Rhenium sources can be prepared in a nuclear reactor by bombarding the non-radioactive metal with neutrons. In a <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-reaction, the two <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/beta.gif">-emitters 186Re and 188Re are produced with high yield. One application of thus prepared radioactive Rhenium wires is the prevention and treatment of restenosis after balloon angioplasty. For this brachytherapeutic application, the source must be very stable, enclosed and safe to handle. The necessary encapsulation of the radioactive source was done by plasma coating with a 240 nm layer of titanium, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. This resulted in a highly radiochemically stable source. The response of endothelium and smooth muscle cells to a radioactive Rhenium-wire and its dosimetry was determined in an in vitro cell model. Our results confirmed that radioactive sources made from 186Re and, even more so, 188Re, are excellent candidates for restenosis inhibition because of their narrow treatment range, sharp dose gradient, inexpensive preparation, excellent stability, easy shielding and conveniently short treatment times.

Metallic rhenium powder of 325 mesh is readily available. Well characterized powder of micrometer size, however, is less easy to obtain. In this presentation, we describe how we prepared rhenium powder with an average particle size of 1-2 &#181;m, starting from 325 mesh material and using a jet mill. The particle size distribution was confirmed by light and scanning electron microscopy, and laser diffraction. The change in density and surface characteristics (porosity) was also analyzed. Biodegradable poly(lactic acid) microspheres were prepared, by a solvent evaporation method, from the resulting rhenium particles and were neutron activated in a nuclear reactor to directly yield 186/188Re-microspheres, useful for the treatment of liver tumors. Biodistribution data in rats as well as first treatment results of Novikoff tumors are presented.

RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY WITH RHENIUM-186 AND RHENIUM-188:</B> Alan R. Fritzberg, Fu-Min Su, NeoRx Corporation, 410 W. Harrison, Seattle, WA 98119
<P>
The radioisotopes of rhenium, Re-186 and Re-188, have physical properties that make them attractive for radiotherapy via antibody mediated targeting. Rhenium186 has a half life of 3.78 days, maximum beta energy of 1.07 MeV and imageable gamma rays. Rhenium-188 has a half life of 17 hours, maximum beta energy of 2.12 MeV and imageable gamma rays. Rhenium-186~with its longer half life is appropriately matched with the larger antibody forms, IgG of 150 kD molecular weight and its F(ab')2 fragment of 100 kD size. Rhenium-188 with its shorter half life may be preferred in instances of rapid tumor uptake and shorter tumor retention. N,S amide thiolate chelating agents such as mercaptoacetylglycylglycyl-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-aminobutyrate have been developed for the attachment of the rhenium radioisotopes to antibodies. With this agent, over 150 patients with solid tumors have been treated with up to 550 mCi of Re-186. Several have had partial responses (&gt; 50% decrease in tumor size).

METALLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE FOR INCREASED GRAIN BOUNDARY DELINEATION OF RHENIUM ALLOYS</B>: Mitchell A. Jacobs, Jozef Fedko, Metallurgical Services Inc., Maywood, IL 60153<P>
Current metallographic preparation techniques for rhenium alloys have been based on the etch and back polish technique due to the soft nature of the rhenium alloys. To date the etch and back polish technique has adequately removed the flowed rhenium material to reveal the microstructure. Recent technology has allowed new polishing media to provide better removal of the flowed material. The resulting microstructure exhibits two dimensional relief in a slightly overetched condition. The significantly increased grain boundary delineation permits better review of the grain size.

ION-IMPLANTATION DOPED RHENIUM AND REFRACTORY METALS:</B> G. Welsch, P.T. Szozdowski, R.M.

Box 135, Pohang, 790-600, Korea<P>
Rhenium and other refractory metals in various product forms can be doped with potassium to stabilize an overlapping recrystallized grain structure for high temperature creep strength. Doping has been performed by ion-implantation into the surface layers of flat sheets. During fabrication of pressure-bonded or roll-bonded multi-layer composites the dopant was incorporated along strategically located internal planes. The dopant is arranged in planar arrays of fine bubbles which play the role of fenceposts as they anchor grain boundaries during recrystallization and grain growth. Doped layer composites can be heated to over 2000&#176;C and maintain an overlapping &quot;brick layer&quot; grain structure whereas undoped layer composites develop grains and grain boundaries that transverse the entire width of the composite. Acknowledgment: The research was funded by The National Science Foundation.

SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAIN STRUCTURES IN POTASSIUM-IMPLANTED RHENIUM:</B> R.M. Collins, G. Welsch, Materials Science and Engineering , Case Western Reserve University, 514 White Bldg., Cleveland, OH 44106-7204<P>
Layer composites of rhenium (re) were made by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The Re layers range from 0.05 to 0.10 mm in thickness. Between Re layer depositions, potassium atoms were injected into the metal matrix by ion implantation to a depth of 600 angstroms and a peak concentration of 1 at%. At high temperatures, the implanted atoms cluster and form bubbles that remain stable and act as barriers that pin grain boundaries thus producing a means for creating artificial grain architectures. The grain structure of the implanted CVD layer composites is compared to that of the un-implanted CVD composite. Room temperature tensile tests show that the artificial grain architecture increases the overall tensile strength of the CVD rhenium composite.

<P>
Tensile properties of rhenium sheet, produced by powder technology techniques, were established from room temperature to 2000&#176;C. The strength of rhenium decreased gradually with increasing temperature while the elongation decreased drastically (from 20% to 5%) as the temperature increased from 1100 to 1200&#176;C. The elongation remained below 5% at temperatures up to 2000&#176;C. Tensile tests were also performed on rhenium -1% tungsten and rhenium-2% iridium. Both alloys were stronger than pure rhenium with the rhenium-1% tungsten alloy being the strongest. Limited creep and creep rupture tests were performed in the 1025 to 1225&#176;C range. The creep tests, with relatively low stresses, indicated a very low stress exponent of 1.3.

MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERISTICS OF Mo-Re ALLOYS SINTERED AT MEDIUM TEMPERATURES:</B> Rodolfo L. Mannheim, Jorge L. Garin, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Casilla 10233, Santiago, Chile
<P>
Mixtures of molybdenum and rhenium powders with particle size distribution bearing 2&#181;m average, were prepared in a planetary mill to yield the Mo-25%Re and Mo50%Re compositions. Tablets were then obtained by compaction at various pressures in the range of 300 to 800 MPa. The pieces were subject to sintering at temperatures of 1400 to 1700&#176;C, under protecting atmosphere of Ar-10%H2 to avoid oxidation of the component metals. The solution of rhenium in the molybdenum matrix was followed by means of X-ray diffraction: it was found that at all sintering temperatures rhenium was totally dissolved in the Mo-25%Re, while small amounts of an intermediate phase were detected in the case of the Mo-50%Re alloy, in good agreement with the phase diagram. The densification of the sintered parts increased with temperature and compaction pressure up to values around 90%. The microstructure of the specimens was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy, while the homogeneity of the sintered alloys was corroborated by EDX line-scan analysis. The microstructure showed well defined equi-axed grains with some microporosity distributed across the surface. A few initial tests on cold rolling of the resulting specimens were conducted with very promising results; in fact, owing to the fine particle size of the powders, the sintering temperature can be lower than those normally utilized in the refractory metals industry.

Because of their capability for producing high power densities without interruption for long time periods (years) small, fast neutron energy spectrum nuclear reactors are candidates for applications such as orbiting satellites, lunar and Mars terrestrial power stations and manned trips to Mars. To provide high efficiency in the conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy, these reactors must operate at high temperatures (e.g. &gt;1000&#176;C) and they are cooled with liquid metals such as lithium. Because of its high temperature strength and excellent chemical compatibility with lithium, rhenium (Re) has been considered for use in nuclear reactors for space power. In a space reactor the Re would be subjected to fast neutron irradiation to fluences of more than 1x1022n/cm2 (Ea &gt; 0.1MeV) during several years of operation. The current work was performed to provide information on the tensile properties of Re as a function of test temperature and the effects of neutron irradiation at high temperatures on these properties. Ductility of Re is high (~40%) at low temperatures but decreased abruptly to less than 5% at temperatures about ~900&#176;C. The work hardening coefficient is very high at room temperature and decreases slowly with increased test temperature. Fast neutron iradiation at approximately 1000, 1100, and 1300&#176;C to fluences of 8x1021 and 4x1022n/cm2 resulted in increases in strength and decreases in ductility for tests at room temperature, at the irradiation temperature, and at fifty degrees above the irradiation temperature. These effects decreased with increased irradiation temperature and increased with increased fluence. Also, irradiation lowered by more than 200&#176;C the temperature of the abrupt increase in ductility.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Cr-Re ALLOYS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES:</B> N. Brodnikovsky, V. Pisarenko, A. Rakitsky, A. Sameljuk, Frantsevich Institute for Problems of Materials Science, 3 Krjijanovskogo Str. 252680 Kiev, Ukraine
<P>
The microstructure and mechanical characteristics of cast alloys Cr-35 Re and Cr-18 Re have been investigated within the wide temperature interval (20-1300&#176;C). It was found that under uniaxial tension within 20-600&#176;C the plasticity of the alloys run into 10-20, whereas it decreased when the temperature rose above 700&#176;C. The appearance of the plastic intercrystalline fracture at the temperatures above 900&#176;C resulted in the sharp decrease of strength and plasticity of the alloys. It was established that small quantities of impurities (CN, C, O) contained in source materials effected the fracture mechanisms substantially. The additives of Fe to the alloys under investigation did not altered plastic characteristics at high test temperatures. The other perfomed research permitted to consider that the Cr-Re alloys can be obtained with high mechanical properties and within the temperature interval 700-1300&#176;C.

It is well known that MO-Re alloys exhibit superior properties among Mo based alloys. However Re effect on the structures and properties of Mo has not well understood. The current state of Mo-Re alloys was therefore reviewed not only in the field of high temperatures but also in the application of high performance. Focusing on the effect of Re concentrations in Mo, the structures and properties of the welds produced by electron beam welding were investigated. Bend and tensile behaviors of the welds were evaluated. Microstructures and fracture surfaces of the welds were examined in details by SEM/EDX and TEM. Furthermore formation and distribution of sigma-phase in Mo-Re welds were studied. A role of signa-phase on the structures and properties of Mo-Re alloys was also discussed.

<P>
Mechanical alloying (MA) of well characterized elemental W (75 wt.%) and Re (25 wt.%) was carried out in a SPEX Mill at ambient temperature for 1,3,5 and 10 hours. Milled products were examined for structural, chemical and morphological details using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. XRD patterns showed continuous decrease in the intensity of Re peaks, with increasing MA time. However the Re peaks continued to be present even after 5 hours of milling. Ten hours of milling showed complete dissolution of Re, as observed by the complete absence of Re peaks in association with W peak shift in accordance with the dissolution of Re in W. Extensive reduction in particle size and chemical homogeneity of the alloy could be established by microstructural and chemical analysis using SEM and TEM. After pressing and sintering of pellets, tests revealed a significant amount of contamination by iron through milling.

THE KEY POINT OF TUNGSTEN-RHENIUM ALLOYS PROCESSING:</B> Ms. Song Lin, 62 Amethyst Way, Franklin Park, NJ 08823 <P>Tungsten-Rhenium alloys have won an important application in various modern technical fields and achieved great economic- technical effects and primarily produced by powder metallurgy. Nevertheless, the practical uses of tungsten-rhenium alloys sometimes are limited due to some difficulties encountered in their processing and applications. The common troubles are as follows: 1). The inhomogeneity of the alloy's composition. 2). The bubbling effect, during sintering of alloy rods. 3). Breaks occurred in winding formation of the alloy wire. 4). The formation of brittle second phases in the alloy. With the purpose to improve the properties of Tungsten Rhenium alloys.

The creep-rupture life of unalloyed molybdenum at 0.65Tm is only increased by an order of magnitude with up to 50% Re addition. A proprietary process, developed for unalloyed molybdenum, results in an increase in creep-rupture life at 0.65Tm by 4-5 orders of magnitude. A Mo-14Re alloy processed by a similar method exhibits comparable creep rupture strength while recrystallized material retains a DBTT significantly below room temperature.

THE INFLUENCE OF RHENIUM ON STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRENGTH EUTECTIC CHROMIUM BASED ALLOYS</B>: L.V. Artyuh, O.A. Bilous, A.A. Bondar, M.P. Burka, S.A.

<P>
In our Institute some data were obtained that chromium-carbide eutectic cast alloys have prospects promising. The eutectic (CR)+(TiC) alloy has Vickers hardness about 100 Kg/mm2 at 1000&#176;C and is harder than traditional commercial alloys on the base of iron, cobalt or nickel in some times about 1000&#176;C. And what is more that the latter is able to be machined with the former at high temperature. Produced from (Cr)+(TiC) swages allowed to carry out isothermic swaging of high-temperature strength X<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-pi.gif">220BX alloy (the Ni-based material for vane gas-turbine engine) in air at 1150&#176;C and 200 Mpa stress. Molybdenum additions to the eutectic (Cr)+(TiC) alloy were determined to increase high temperature hardness to 1000&#176;C up to 200-300 Kg/mm2. Continuing development the effect of rhenium on the structure and high-temperature hardness of eutectic two-phases (Cr)+(TiC) alloys in Cr-Ti-C and Cr-Mo-Ti-C systems was examined in this investigation. The rhenium additions being 5, 10 and 20 at. &amp; were shown to lead to the formation of limited quantity of third phase, (Cr23C6). Highly dispersed eutectic structure became more homogeneous. According to microprobe analysis the rhenium (as molybdenum) is predominatly dissolved in chromium matrix. High-temperature hardness was determined to be increased already with 5 at.% Re additions. The develop is about 100 kg/mm2 at 300-800&#176;C and about 40 Kg/mm2 at 1000&#176;C. It became higher with increasing rhenium content up to 20 at.%. The hardness of five-component alloys was always more than four-component at the whole temperature interval. The maximum was found at maximum rhenium content (450 Kg/mm2 at 900&#176;C). to our mind the develop was achieved due to solid solution strengthening of chromium matrix (well-known &quot;rhenium effect&quot;). The determined of hardness allows to estimate the strength characteristics using the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">=HV/3 connection. Therefore the eutectic (Cr)+(TiC) alloys with rhenium alloying are believed to become more perspective for application.

Microstructure, fracture mode and mechanical properties of vacuum melted binary WR-27VM, MR-47VM alloys and ternary MWR-10/45VM alloy both deformed and recrystallized are investigated in the temperature range of 20-1200&#176;C. Conditions for o-phase precipitation hardening are found. The effect of a-phase on the low-temperature ductility and low and high-temperature strength is estimated. Corrosion resistance at 400-1000&#176;C and features of the chanses in surface layer composition in products of ammonia thermal dissotiation are investigated. It is shown that ternary alloy has high low-temperature ductility and strength and moderate high temperature strength as these of MR-47VM as well, as high corrosion resistance in ammonia dissotiation products close to that of WR-27VM.

<P>
The fine particle powder technology was used for the production of W-Re alloys. Single phase W-Re powders were obtained by co-reduction of fine particle W-Re oxide blends. The homogeneous disperse W-20%Re powders and the single phase W-80%Re intermetalide powder with particle size in range of 1- 4 &#181;k were synthesized. W-20%Re powder was mixed with the W powder of the same dispersion in order to obtain W-2%Re alloy. The <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-phase would not be formed during the sintering because Re in blend is in form of the prealloyed W-20%Re powder. The synthesized W-2%Re ingots were rolled in 2-3 mm sheets. The mechanical characteristics and the structure of the material were investigated. The sheets had higher plasticity due to the 2%Re alloying. The W-80%Re alloy powders were successfully used for the production of long working time impregnated cathodes.

<P>
Uzbek Refractory and Heat Resistant Metals Integrated Plant is a complex enterprise infield of manufacture tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium, and alloys on their basis. There is a special technology of imputing rhenium from molybdenum concentrates, which contains from 300 GR. to 700 GR. rhenium per each 1 ton of concentrate at the enterprise. Moly concentrates are manufactured by method of nitrogen acid imputing. In this case basic point of rhenium transferring into liquids which contains molybdenum, rhenium and nitrogen and sulfur acids. Using such types of liquids, there are well known methods such as extraction and distilled rectification methods of imputing rhenium. And all above mention of methods have low effect. That is why researching in field of sorption technology of imputing rhenium from nitrogen-sulfur liquids. Researching of wide range of low, middle and high basis of anionites determined that the best one is vanil-peridium resin. Using such type of resin in industry we achieved 80% imputing rhenium as ammonium perrenatum. There is wide range of utility possibilities now we can use our own rhenium and produce powder alloys on basis of tungsten and molybdenum. Tungsten alloys are: BP-3; BP-S; BP-20. Molybdenum alloys are: MKP-16; MP-47. Wire produced from tungsten and molybdenum alloys using in thermometry and tube building industry as they have hardest characteristics.

Existence of the rhenium effect improving the mechanical properties of the multycomponent chromium alloys (containing the rhenium and carbon together with other elements) specifies our interest in Re-Cr-C ternary system. Constitution and properties of more than 40 alloys prepared by arc melting were investigated by metallography, x-ray diffraction, microprobe and differential thermal analyses and Pirani-Altertum method in total concentration range. Rhenium raises the melting point of bcc chromium based phase (up to 2284&#176;C in binary system Re-Cr). The maximum temperature of melting for the carbon and rhenium saturated chromium in equilibria with (Cr,Re)23C6 and (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-Re3Cr2) amounts to 1650&#176;C and appear more high then melting temperature for binary alloys containing Cr and Cr23C6 phases (1581&#176;C). Ternary alloys of this two phase field have higher strength and ductility than binary ones. It is in according to data about existence rhenium effect in chromium based alloys. Essential singularity of Re-Cr-C system is immensely high combined solubility of the chromium and carbon in rhenium at high temperatures (about 50 at% Cr at 30 at% C: and 1710&#176;C) and significant solubility of rhenium in chromium carbides (the most solubility Re in Cr23C6 amounts to 18, in Cr7C3 and Cr3C2 ones do 8 and 6 at.% at, 1655, 1710 and 1760&#176;C, respectively ). Rhenium based solid solution forms equilibria with carbon, solid solutions of rhenium in chromium carbides and (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-Re3Cr2) and thus it specifies the constitution of Re-Cr-C ternary system.

RHENIUM AS AN ALLOY ADDITION TO THE GROUP VA METALS:</B> R.W. (Bill) Buckman Jr., Refractory Metals Technology, P.O. Box 100551, Pittsburgh, PA 15236
<P>
The anomalous effect rhenium has on the ductility of the Group VIA elements Mo, W, and Cr is not observed in the Group VA metals Ta, Nb, and V. The low temperature ductility of the Group VA elements is significantly impaired at rhenium additions greater than about 3 atom percent. However, rhenium has been shown to significantly improve the high temperature creep strength of tantalum alloys and the effect is saturated at about 1.5 atom percent rhenium, a level which does not alter the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of tantalum alloys significantly.

UNDERCOOLING EXPERIMENTS ON RHENIUM AND RHENIUM ALLOYS BY DROP-TUBE PROCESSING:</B> Bernard Vinet and Sandrine Tournier, Commissariat &aacute; l' &Eacute;nergie Atomique, DTA/CEREM-D&eacute;partement d'&Eacute;tude des Mat&eacute;riaux, 17 rue des Martyrs, 38054 Grenoble c&eacute;dex 9, France
<P>
Solidification of deeply undercooled melts can lead to the same variety of solid state metastabilities as do methods of rapid quenching of the liquid onto cold substrates. Since undercooling is realized at slow cooling rates, containerless processing is often needed to avoid external nucleation sources. In such a way, refractory materials are studied by letting single droplets fall through an evacuated high drop-tube as for instance the 48 metre high facility built in Grenoble. In this contribution, an overview is proposed on the most interesting results obtained so far for rhenium and rhenium alloys. Undercooling experiments have been realized on refractory binary alloys showing complex <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">(D8b, type CrFe, 30 atoms per cell) and X (A12, type <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-Mn, 58 atoms per cell) phases in the equilibrium phase diagram. The studied systems associate a b.c.c. (W, Ta, Mo, Nb) transition metal with a h.c.p. metal, rhenium in the event (Tc, Os and Ru should also be considered if only from a phenomenological point of view). A favoured primarily formation of the metastable bcc-structure instead of the direct formation of the stable phase is obtained in the case of the Re-W system. Moreover, a double recalescence phenomenon is obtained in a composition range between 65 and 82 at% W. This result is discussed in connection with the appearance of the metastable A15 phase. In the case of the Re-Ta system, it is shown that the% phase nucleates from the melt.

PHYSIKO AND CHEMICAL PRINCIPLES OF RHENIUM ALLOYS DEVELOPMENT: </B>K.B. Povarova, M.A. Tylkina, Baikov Institute of Metallurgy, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky Pr. 49, 117911 Moscow, Russia
<P>
Physiko-chemical principles of rhenium alloys development are considered and examples are shown of application of these principles to the development of conventional and advanced rhenium alloys. The features of physiko-chemical interaction of rhenium with elements of Periodic table in binary, temary and more complicated alloy systems are analysed. Special attention is given to the theoretical analysis of experimental &quot;composition-property&quot; diagrams. The role of electronic structure is discussed as concerns the effect of the chemical composition on some physical and mechanical properties of Cr- Moe, or WRe-based solid solutions. The stability is estimated of solid solutions, intermetallic compounds, and interstitual phases in rhenium alloys, as well as the tendencies and rates of diffusion processes in multi component heterogenious rhenium alloys. Special rhenium effects responsible for decreasing of cold brittleness phenomena in IV group metals are discussed as well as high strain-hardening rates of W-and Mo-alloys with Re. Application of Re-contained alloys are observed.

THE RHENIUM EFFECT IN W- AND Mo- BASE ALLOYS: THE EXPERIMENTAL REGULARITIES AND THE PHYSICAL NATURE:</B> A.D. Korotaev, A.N. Tyumentsev, Yu. I. Pochivalov, Siberian Physical &amp; Technical Institute, Revolution Sq. 1, 634050 Tomsk, Russia
<P>
The experimental data on the rhenium effect and related phenomena, such as the solution softening, the elastic twinning and superelasticity, the high strengthening capacity of Mo-Re alloys, allowing a strength of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 9000 Mpa, etc., are critically reviewed. Particular attention is given to the authors' results on the high (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gtequalto.gif"> 4 at.%) solubility of oxygen in Mo-Re alloys, to the segregation of the interstitial on the structure defects, and to the contribution of these factors to the increase of the plasticity. Some considerations are advanced on the reason for the increase in plasticity for alloys with a rhenium content of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 5-10 at.%. The effect of the rhenium alloying on the decrease in the mobility of screw dislocations and the contributions of the Peierls forces to the increase in plasticity are discussed. The problem of the formation of local composition irregularities with an atomic short-range order and a type A15 lattice and the relevant experimental data are considered. It is supposed that the grain bulk-to-boundary strength ratio is important for high temperature (1300 K) strength and plasticity of Mo-Re alloys to be attained.

THE SOLUBILITY OF OXYGEN IN RHENIUM-ALLOYED MOLYBDENUM:</B> A.D. Korotaev, A.N. Tyumentsev, V.V. Manako, Siberian Physical &amp; Technical Institute, Revolution Sq. 1, 634050 Tomsk, Russia
<P>
The regularities of the phase transformations and the variation of the composition of Mo-Re-base alloys in the process of oxygen diffusion alloying were investigated. It has been found that the alloying with rhenium to a concentration of 47 wt.% increases (to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 4 at.% and more) the solubility of oxygen, reduces (by 2-3 orders) its diffusion coefficient in molybdenum, and prevents the increase in the oxygen solubility at dislocations and small-angle boundaries of the substructure and the segregated enriching of intergrain boundaries with oxygen. For the Mo-Re alloys subjected to solid-solution hardening with oxygen it has been found that the phenomenon of mechanical twinning is suppressed and the characteristics of the dislocation structure are changed on plastic deformation. Moreover, in the solid solutions of the Mo 47% Re alloys, local regions of the short-range order or type Mo3ReOx complexes with the A15 structure, stabilized as a result of the diffusion of oxygen atoms, are observed. The role played by the regularities revealed in the realization of the rhenium effect is discussed.

THE ROLE OF PRECIPITATES OF CLOSE PACKED PHASES IN THE &quot;RHENIUM EFFECT&quot;:</B> Yu. N. Gornostyrev , M.I. Katsnelson, Institute of Metal Physics, 620219 Ekaterinburg, Russia; A.V. Trefilov, Kurchatov Institute, 123182 Moscow, Russia
<P>
The connection of &quot;rhenium effect&quot; (simultaneous increase of the strength and plasticity in W, Mo, Cr by adding rhenium at a concentration close to the solubility limit) with the peculiar structural state of corresponding alloys is discussed. The hypothesis is suggested, according to which the main factor for the appearance of the rhenium effect is the formation of dispersed close packed (of Frank-Kasper type) phases such as W3Re with A15 structure or distorted <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/sigma.gif">-phase. The general problem of the appearance of dispersed Frank-Kasper phases near the instability boundary of BCC lattice in transition metal alloys is considered in the framework of a simple crystallogeometrical model. It is shown that the precipitates of the phases in BCC host may provide the increase of the solubility of interstitial impurities. The replacement of carbide phases by the precipitates of the Frank-Kasper phases may lead to the improvement of mechanical properties of the alloys.

LOW- AND HIGH-RHENIUM TUNGSTEN ALLOYS: PROPERTIES, PRODUCTION, AND TREATMENT:</B> K.B. Povarova, O.A. Bannych, E.K. Zavarzina, Baikov Institute of Metallurgy, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky Pr. 49, 117334 Moscow, Russia
<P>
Author's experimental data on the effect of rhenium on the microstructure and some physical and mechanical properties of W-Re alloys, including molybdenum-containing alloys and alloys strengthened by interstitial phases are discussed. On the base of these data as well as on literature data, low-alloyed and high alloyed W-Re-alloys for different operating conditions are developed. Advantages and disadvantages of the vacuum melting and powder metallurgy processes for production of these alloys are discussed. The ways for increase in purity and improve of homogeneous distribution of rhenium in sintered PM-alloys are discussed too. Analysis of numerous experimental data on the effect of plastic deformation and heat treatment on microstructure, fracture mode and mechanical properties of the rhenium alloyed materials shows the possibility to predict mechanical properties of deformed alloys during their thermo-meohanical treatment and for operating in the wide temperature range.

DISPERSION AND SUBSTRUCTURE HARDENING OF Mo-Re BASE ALLOYS:</B> A.N. Tyumentsev, A.D. Korotaev, Yu. P. Pinzhin, Siberian Physical &amp; Technical Institute, Revolution Sq. 1, 634050 Tomsk, Russia
<P>
Using the literature and original data on the phenomenon of internal oxidation (IO) in low alloys based on Mo and Mo-47% Re, the basic mechanisms of this phenomenon and the scientifc principles for controlling the parameters of the heterophase structure formed on IO are discussed. On this basis, new methods for dispersion and combined dispersion and substructure hardening of type Mo-47% Re - Zr alloys have been developed and used. These methods provide a depth-uniform distribution of the ZrO2 oxide stable until <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif">2500K and a high recrystallization temperature (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/approx-equal.gif">2300K). The resulting high-strength state is stable to heat with the large plasticity margin retained. Based on the study of the regularities and mechanisms of the plastic deformation and destruction of internally oxidized Mo-Re-base alloys, the hardening mechanisms with IO and the potentialities of the methods developed for increasing the heat resistance of the Mo-Re-base alloys have been analyzed.

&quot;RHENIUM EFFECT&quot; ON THE IMPROVING OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN Mo, W, Cr AND THEIR ALLOYS:</B> Yu. V. Milman, G.G. Kurdumova, Institute for Problems of Material Science, 3 Krzhizhanovsky Str., Kiev 252180,Ukraine
<P>
The current state of science and mechanical properties improving for Cr, Mo and W alloyed by Re (so-called &quot;rhenium effect&quot;) is reviewed. The main possibilities for increasing low-temperature plasticity of Cr, Mo and W by Re additions are closely connected with electron structure change during alloying; that is, plasticity is increased when alloying essentially changes the electron structure by disturbing the optimum conditions of the resonance covalent bond and changing the filling of energy bands. The observed growth of the density of electron states at the Fermi level N(EF) is accompanied by lowering of Peierls stress, decrease of staking fault energy ( SFE), increase of activation volume and interstitial solubility, and the involvement of an additional deformation mechanism - twinning. The increase of N(EF) should not be very sharp for SFE and interstitial solubility to have the optimum value. SFE has to be lowered so that twinning can occur, but the mobility of dislocation screw components should not be impeded. Lowering of SFE is accompanied by growth of activation volume and increase of stress relaxation rate at concentrators. The increase of interstitial solubility should be sufficient to diminish the tendency to impurity segregation on dislocations as well as on grain and subgrain boundaries, but not so great as cause the abrupt hardening of a solid solution . The experimental results devoted to the influence of Re additions on the dislocation structure, mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms are discussed. <P>

DEVELOPMENT AND TURBINE ENGINE PERFORMANCE OF THREE ADVANCED RHENIUM CONTAINING SUPERALLOYS FOR SINGLE CRYSTAL AND DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED BLADES AND VANES:</B> Robert W. Broomfield, David A. Ford, Harry K. Bhangu, Rolls-Royce Plc., Derby and Bristol, U.K.; Malcolm C. Thomas, Donald J. Frasier, Phil S.

<P>
Turbine inlet temperatures over the next few years will approach 1650&#176;C (3000&#176;F) at maximum power for the latest large commercial turbofan engines, resulting in high fuel efficiency and power levels approaching 442 kN (100,000 lbs). High reliability and durability must be intrinsically designed into these turbine engines to meet extended over-water, large twin engine aircraft (ETOPS) certification requirements. This level of performance has been brought about by a combination of advances in air cooling for turbine blades and vanes, design technology for stresses and airflow, single crystal and directionally solidified casting process improvements, the development and use of rhenium (Re) containing high y' nickel-base superalloys with advanced coatings, including full-airfoil ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Re additions to cast airfoil superalloys not only improve creep and thermo-mechanical fatigue strength but also environmental properties, including coating performance. Re dramatically slows down diffusion in these alloys at high temperature turbine operation conditions. A team approach has been used to develop a family of two single crystal alloys (CMSX-4. containing 3% Re and CMSX.-10 containing 6% Re) and a directionally solidified, columnar grain alloy (CM 1 86LC. containing 3% Re) for a variety of turbine engine applications. A range of critical properties of these alloys are reviewed in relation to component turbine engineering performance through engine certification testing and service experience. Industrial turbines are now commencing to use this aero developed turbine technology in both small and large frame units in addition to aero-derivative industrial engines. These applications are demanding with high reliability required for turbine airfoils out to 25,000 hours. with perhaps greater than 50% of the time spent at maximum power. Combined cycle efficiencies of large frame industrial engines is scheduled to reach 60% in the U.S. ATS program. Application experience out to a total 2 million engine hours and 28,000 hours individual blade set service for CMSX-4. first stage turbine blades is reviewed for a small frame industrial engine.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RHENIUM FROM PRODUCTION TO USE IN HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS:</B><I> Paul Forde</I>, H. C. Starck Inc., 45 Industrial Place, Newton, MA 02161-1961
<P>
The major use of Rhenium is in catalysts primarily in the petrochemical industry. However, due to increased demands in high temperature turbine applications, Re is becoming a critical alloying element primarily in nickel base, single crystal superalloys. As a member of the refractory metal family of elements, Re is a higher cost member, in pat due to the expense associated with production. This paper briefly address the new significance of Re in superalloy applications, where its use was practically non-existent in polycrystalline alloys. Also included is an overview of the raw materials from which Re is processed as well as the production techniques currently in use.<B>

Rhenium influence (at content up to 30 at.%) on the character of the change of the crystal and intercrystalline boundary mechanical properties was studied using single crystal and bicrystal alloy specimens produced by electron beam zone melting. Tensile tests of single crystals were carried out at 20&#176;C, their impact strength was studied at temperatures from -200&#176;C up to +300&#176;C, the depth of microcracks appearing at electrodischarge treatment and hardness was measured. Bicrystal specimens of the alloys having 5,10 and 2Q at.% of Re were tested for impact strength at 20&#176;C, microcrack depth in the crystals and on the intercrystalline boundaries after electrodischarge treatment was studied. Disorientation angle ranges of the twist intercrystalline boundaries were 7-9&#176; and 18-21&#176;. It is shown that alloying strengthens crystals and improve their ductility. Single crystal strengthening has not monotonous nature. Minimum of hardness, ultimate strength and yield strength was observed at 3-4 at.% of Re. The alloying decreases microcrack depth after electrodischarge treatment both in crystals and on the intercrvstalline boundaries however the depth of the last ones is always more.

THE RHENIUM IMPACT ON THE MASS TRANSFER IN Mo-Re SINGLE CRYSTALS UNDER SHOCK LOADING:</B> S.V. Divinski, L.N. Larikov, M.N. Belyakova, V.V. Zholud, V.F. Mazanko, Institute of Metal Physics, National Academy of Sciences, 36 Vernadsky Str., Kiev-142, 252142, Ukraine
<P>
An abnormally high depths of marked atom penetration at shock loading have been discovered for Fe and then were observed for a number of metals. In this work, this phenomenon is thoroughly investigated for the Mo-Re single crystals. It was found that Re moderates substantially the mass transfer. The derth of penetration of the Ni-63 isotopes decreases to 17 and 3 percents of that value for pure Mo if the Re content is 10 and 17 at.%, respectively. These results are discussed in a framework of Re impact on generation and migration of interstitials under movement of jugged screw dislocations. Moreover, the Re alloying increases the contribution of twinning to the plastic deformation. A computer model of enhanced mass transfer at shock loading has been proposed and the Re impact was numerically studied.

Structure of Re single crystal with the {0001}&lt;1120&gt; orientation subjected to rolling has been investigated. Initial orientation is unstable and single crystal is transformed to polycrystalline state. This texture evolution has been analyzed by a computer model. A good agreement with experiment has been achieved. Strain dependence of density of the Re crystal reveals abrupt increase at about 22% of strain, although visible cracks at external surface appear only at ~30% of strain. The last value corresponds to pronounced intensifying of the subsequent recrystallization under annealing. Influence of rotational deformation modes have been numerically studied and their substantial impact on axial textures of Re was predicted.

The structure and mechanical properties of single crystals W and binary alloys W-Re that were grown by electron beam zone technology with low carbon concentration (10-6&#247;10-7Torr) in the direction axis &lt;100&gt;&#177;(1&#247;1.5). The yield stress and the ductile-brittle transition temperature of the W and W-Re single crystals of the specimens that were cut normally to the direction of crystals growing have been determined to be lower than in parallel cut ones. That is determined by dislocation structure anisotropy of single crystals. Alloying tungsten single crystal with rhenium results in considerable decrease of cold brittleness temperature Tb was shown. The most effective are the lowest rhenium concentration. Thus, adding of o.1 at.% Re decreases Tb from -40&#176;C and 4.3 at.% Re only to -60&#176;C in parallely cut specimens, for example. It should be marked, yield stress grows proportionally the rhenium content in alloys.

Electro-beam zone melting was used to grow high purity Re single crystals with different crystallography orientations. Thermo-electrical moving force (t-c.m.f.) of Re-single crystal was found to insignificantly increase upon 4 h vacuum annealing at 2000&#176;C. In this case anisotrophy of Re-single crystal t-e. m.f. substantially increased. Comparison between Re-single and polycrystals showed that electrical properties of single crystal were stable in contrary of that of the polycrystal. Structure, hardness and specific electrical resistivity of Re-single crystal were established to insubstantially increase upon thermocycling (1600-400&#176;C, 300 cycles). Specimens as 5x5 mm2, 100 mm rectangle (with two sides parallel to basic plane) were cut from Re-single crystal ingot. The shape of this specimens was unchanged upon above mentioned thermocycling. Explanation of stability of Re-single crystal and its application were discussed.

USAGE OF EB FLOATING ZONE MELTING FOR PRODUCTION OF RHENIUM ALLOYS WIRE:</B> A.V. Elutin, I.A. Yudin, State Research Centre-State Institute of Rare Metals-GIREDMET, 5 B Tolmachevsky Per., Moscow 109017, Russia
<P>
In the eighties in the former USSR some efforts were made to create modern equipment for producing single crystals of refractory metals by electron beam (EB) floating zone melting. Using this EB furnaces, single crystals of tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, niobium and rhenium were produced. Dimen sions of crystals were up to 35-40 mm in diameter for tungsten and up to 110 mm for niobium. This report contains experimental data in studying process of growing single crystals of rhenium containing alloys based on molybdenum and tungsten, such as Mo48%Re alloys and W-27%Re and polycrystalline as cast rods and bars. It was found that this method is very efficient for producing calibrated bars from these alloys which can be used in wire production without mechanical treatment. This technology provides very high yield of metals.

GROWTH FEATURES OF W-Re SINGLE CRYSTALS UPON PLASMA ARC MELTING:</B> G.S. Burkhanov, V.M. Kirillova, Baikov Institute of Metallurgy, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky Pr. 49, 117911 Moscow, Russia; B.D. Bryskin, Rhenium Alloys, Inc., 1329 Taylor Street, P.O. Box 245, Elyria, OH 44036-0245
<P>
Plasma-arc welding was used to grow high purity W-Re single crystals in a wide concentration range (1-20 wt.% Re). Relationship between solidification (growth rate &quot;R&quot;, temperature gradient in liquid phase - ''GL', Re concentration - &quot;Co&quot;) and growth structure (cellular, dendritic, single- and polycrystalline) of W-Re alloys was determined and shown as &quot;Co - GL/R _&quot;' diagram. Effect of crystallographic instability was discovered for (W-Re) single crystals with [110] and [111] orientation which were changed to preferable [100] growth orientation upon growing. The reason of this orientation and its dynamics were examined. W-Re single crystals of 1st melt were characterized by considerable misorientation of 1st order subgrains from seed to the top of ingot and &quot;striped&quot; microstructure. Such structure and instability of crystallographic growth were examined by concentration undercoolings. The ways for improving of W-Re single crystals structure perfection are suggested.

METHOD FOR PRODUCING HIGH-PURITY RHENIUM FOIL:</B> A.V. Elutin, K.S. Kovalev, T.B. Danilina, State Research Centre-State Institute of Rare Metals-GIREDMET, 5 B. Tolmachevsky Per., Moscow 109017, Russia
<P>
For some applications, such as manufacturing of the thermionic cathodes of mass spectrometers and other purposes a rhenium foil of 20-40 mcm thickness with a base metal content of 99.99-99.999% is used. For producing of high-purity rhenium foil we use rhenium bars made by EB floating zone melting which have 20-30 mm in diameter, 200-500 mm in length, single-crystal line structure and 99.999% purity. During the foil production significant advantages may be obtained by using single crystalline billets having a crystallographic orientation that is favorable for deformation. With this approach, it becomes possible to achieve by rolling total reduction value of up to 50-65% as compared to some 5-7% in case of using polycrystalline billets of identical purity, and to obtain after a first annealing a relatively homogeneous fine-grain recrystallized structure that is favorable for subsequent rolling steps. It was shown by practice that the above described method makes possible to produce rhenium foil with 99.99% purity and upwards.

ELECTRODE POTENTIAL DEPENDENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRACKING IN HIGH STRENGTH 7XXX ALUMINUM ALLOYS: </B>L.M. Young, R.P. Gangloff, Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
This research aims to determine the effect of electrode potential on the kinetics of environmental crack growth in precipitation hardened 7XXX aluminum alloys. High resolution compliance and electric potential measurements of da/dt provide part of the foundation to understand the mechanisms for the agingmicrostructure dependence of shorttransverse cracking. Measured Stage II growth rates in AA7075T651, immersed in aqueous chloride, are slow and depend on electrode potential and inhibitor addition. For cracking in a molybdatechloride solution, da/dt rises from 107 mm/s at 900 mVSCE (nearopen circuit) to 105 mm/s at 750 mVSCE, but is constant or declines with more noble applied polarization. The crack path is along or near highangle boundaries, but the crystallographic and microstructure details are undefined. These results are consistent with literature findings for AA7075T6 in KI solution. The potential for the maximum in da/dt is more noble for the iodide compared to the molybdate, and is most active for cracking in bare chloride solution. This transition potential is governed by the onset of substantial localized crack tip dissolution which causes an IR difference that shields the crack from changes in anodic polarization. The importance of this potential dependence is illustrated by results for AA 7050T6 in molybdate. Crack growth is faster compared to the AA7075 case if both alloys are at their open circuit potential. Crack growth in AA7050 is slower than that in AA7075 if the comparison is made at a fixed electrode potential.

<P>GRAIN SIZE AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF INELASTIC DEFORMATION IN 5083 Al ALLOY:</B> Yong Nam Kwon, Young Won Chang, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790784, Korea
<P>
The inelastic deformation behavior of 5083 A1 alloy has been studied to clarify the effects of grain size and temperature by conducting a series of load relaxation tests. The experimental results were then analyzed based on the recently proposed internal variable theory of inelastic deformation. The inelastic deformation of fine grained 5083 Al alloy at high temperatures is confirmed to consist of grain boundary sliding and accommodating grain matrix deformation caused by dislocation glide processes. A HallPetch type relation is found to exist between the grain size and an internal strength variable, instead of the generally used flow stress.

<P>ON THE WARPAGE OF 7050 ALUMINUM PLATES: </B>M.L. Smith, J. Foyos, E.W. Lee, C. Ho, and O.S. Es-Said, Mechanical Engineering Department, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, CA 90045; Naval Air Warfare Center, Code 434200A, NAWCAD PAX, Patauxent River, MD 20670; Mechanical Engineering Department, Howard University, Washington, DC
<P>
Investigators need a consistent and accurate method to measure and report sample warpage to assess material distortion during heat treatment. Consistent and accurate sample surface profile measurement can commence only after the sample is precisely positioned. This paper proposes using a positioning fixture which exactly constrains a sample's six degrees of freedom. Mounted in this fixture, standard dimensional inspection tools such as level gauges and dial indicator are then used to measure profiles along predetermined sample surface zones. Normalizing those measurements with respect to fixture constraint points and then plotting them on a graph allow precise warpage measurement and easy distortion visualization. In this study samples of 7050 plates were machined. The samples were of 1', 1.5&quot;, and 4&quot; thickness and the crosssectional shapes were Uchannels and I beams. Samples were solution treated and one group was quenched in water and the second group in a polyalkylene-glycol solution. The effect of the sample's thickness and shape as well as the quenching medium on the warpage behavior will be discussed.

<P>DYNAMIC DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS OF AlLi ALLOYS:</B> <I>Chang Gil Lee</I>, Ki Jong Kim, and Sunghak Lee, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790784, Korea
<P>
This paper presents a correlation study between microstructure and dynamic deformation behavior of AlLi alloys which have great potential for structural armor materials. The selected materials were a 2090 AlLi alloy, a Weldalite 049 alloy, and a 7039 Al alloy, to allow a comparative study of different strengths and microstructures. These alloys were deformed at a very high strain rate by ballistic impact. The amount and the distribution of adiabatic shear bands were examined after the ballistic impact testing, and the dynamic shear stressstrain curves were obtained from the dynamic torsional Kolsky bar (strain rate=i-103/sec) test in order to evaluate the possibility of forming adiabatic shear bands. In the vicinity of the perforated region, adiabatic shear bands were hardly observed in the 2090 and the Weldalite alloys, whereas they easily formed in the 7039 alloy. The overall observed phenomenology was interpreted using the dynamic shear stress strain curves, together with the strength level and microstructure. In the curves, the maximum shear stress and the shear strain at the maximum stress point were of primary importance in analyzing the adiabatic shear banding behavior, suggesting that the torsional Kolsky bar test is a good tool for evaluating the ballistic performance AlLi alloys.

COMPETITION BETWEEN METASTABLE AND STABLE PHASES DURING SOLIDIFICATION OF AlFeVSi ALLOYS:</B> Hyang Jin Koh, Woo Jin Park*, Sangho Ahn* and Nack J.

<P>
AlFeVSi alloys have been produced by strip casting and spray casting. These processes offer relatively fast solidification rates and can produce near net shape products such as thin gauge strips or billets with the fine microstructure free from segregation. It has been shown that the microstructure of the alloys consists of various phases; bcc phase, microquasicrystalline phase, icosahedral phase, and the newly found hexagonal phase. All the phases are structurally related and have close orientation relationships among them. The volume fraction and distribution of these phases depend on the solidification rate and the degree of undercooling. The degree of recalescence occurring during solidification also affects the final microstructure, in that the less thermally stable phases transform to the stable phase.

THE EFFECTS OF AGING ON THE DIFFUSION AND TRAPPING OF HYDROGEN IN AN AL6.2ZN2.3MG2.3CU ALLOY: </B>George A. Young Jr., John R. Scully, Center for Electrochemical Science &amp; Engineering, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
Thermal desorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the diffusion and trapping of hydrogen in a Al6.2Zn2.3Mg2.3Cu alloy and in pure aluminum. Both the peak aged (T6) and overaged (T74) tempers were investigated for the alloy. Hydrogen was uniformly charged into rodshaped samples via exposure to water vapor saturated air. Isothermal desorption scans were utilized to determine the apparent activation energy for hydrogen diffusion. Constant heating rate thermal desorption scans were performed to identify hydrogen trap sites and quantify trap binding energies. In all desorption experiments, a quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to distinguish the desorption of hydrogen from that of other atomic or molecular species. Results from isothermal experiments show that bulk diffusion of hydrogen in the overaged alloy is appreciably slower than in the peak aged temper or in pure aluminum. Constant heating rate experiments reveal multiple trapping sites in both the alloy and in pure aluminum. The effects of the number and binding energy of trap sites on the diffusivity of hydrogen is quantified and the implications of these results on the hydrogen environment assisted cracking of precipitation hardened AlZnMg alloys are discussed.

<P>EVOLUTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE, FRACTURE TOUGIINESS AND FATIGUE RESISTANCE DURING PROCESSING OF 7X50 ALUMINU1\I ALLOYS: </B><I>F.D.S. Marquis</I>, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, College of Chemical, Physical, and Materials Science &amp; Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD 57701
<P>
The evolution of microstructures was studied in 7X50 aluminum alloys, as a function of the manufacturing variables, during laboratory and industrial processing conditions. The fracture toughness, fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation of typical microstructures was measured. Low fracture toughness values and low resistance to fatigue crack growth were observed as a result of a high degree of recrystallization and a large volume fraction of both particles and hydrogen porosity. The resistance to fatigue crack propagation was higher in microstructures consisting of deformed grains with significant substructure. The morphology of various types of particles, volume fraction of the recrystallized microstructures, the grain and subgrain morphologies were observed to influence considerably the fatigue resistance. These microstructural parameters could be controlled effectively by the amount of total strain and the strain of the final pass, and the deformation temperatures during controlled rolling and subsequent double aging during final thermomechanical processing. Relationships between microstructure/fracture toughness/fatigue resistance will be discussed.

EFFECT OF PRE-AGE STRETCHING ON MECHANICAL AND HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF THE 2024T851 ALUMINUM ALLOY FOR AIRCRAFT: </B>Han-Cheng Shih, New-Jin Ho*, Steel and Aluminum Research &amp; Development Dept. *Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University
<P>
Cold-stretching prior to artificial aging could increase the yield strength of the 3024 aluminum alloy due to the enhanced nucleation of the S' precipitates. However, the S' phase itself became weakened in resistance to dislocating due to thinning and was thus more easily sheared off. Consequently, the Orowan's strengthening mechanism could only occur in specimens undergoing longtime overaging. The strength of this alloy were thus a compromise of dislocationinduced hardening and precipitate-induced softening. Also, its high cycle fatigue performance became more and more deteriorated with increasing pre-aging strain on the basis of the similar reason.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEXTURE IN AlLi 2195 ALLOY DURING RING ROLL FORGING: </B>Lan Zhang, <I>Peter N. Kalu</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, FAMUFSU College of Engineering, Tallahassee, FL 32310
<P>
This study presents results of texture and microstructural development in AlLi 2195 alloy processed by near-net-shape roll forging method. The manufacturing technique is a multistage process that combines conventional ingot conversion, back extrusion, and ring rolling to produce a heavy walled cylindrical forging preform. The preform is then rolled to nearfinal diameter using contoured rolling mandrels. A combination of optical microscopy, Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) and Orientation Imaging Microscopy (O1M) was used in this investigation. At the early stage of processing, (110) fiber texture was predominant. Following the second stage of processing, the texture was similar to characteristic fcc rolling texture. At the conclusion of processing, {001}&lt;110&gt; and {112}&lt;110&gt; shear components were developed at the expense of Brass ! component. The possible mechanisms responsible for the texture changes are discussed in relation with the microstructural evolution.

ALLOY COMPOSITION EFFECT ON THE GLASS FORMING ABILITY AND THERMAL STABILITY OF THE Al86Mm4Ni10-xFex AMORPHOUS ALLOYS</B>: H.W. Jin, Y.J. Kim, C.G. Park, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang Univ. of Sci. &amp; Tech., Pohang 790784, Korea; M.C. Kim, Research Inst. of Industrial Science and Tech., Pohang 790600, Korea
<P>
Amorphous aluminum alloys show an attractive combination of high tensile strength and low density. The commercial applications of these alloys, however, have been restricted due to relatively poor thermal stability and glass forming ability (GFA). The GFA and the thermal stability of Al86Mn4Ni10-xFex alloys have been investigated with various alloy composition. Amorphous ribbons with the thickness from 20pm to 30&#181;m were prepared by single roll melt-spinner. The microstructural evolution upon heating was observed by using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The GFA of the present alloys decreased with the increase of Fe content. However, the first (lowest) crystallization temperature, Txl, increased with increasing Fe content. The effects of alloy composition on the GFA and the thermal stability will be discussed in terms of the atomic bonding and electronic structure of the amorphous alloy.

EFFECT OF STRETCHING PRIOR TO AGING</B> <B>ON MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AlCuLi (2195) ALLOY: </B>Z.X. Li1, R A. Mirshams1, E.A. Kenik2, P.J.

<P>
The Al-Cu-Li (2195) alloy was stretched uniaxially from 0% to 15% of plastic deformation prior to aging. The tensile properties of naturally and artificially aged specimens in 0, 45, and 90 degrees with respect to the pre-stretching direction were evaluated and their microstructures were characterized via TEM. The results indicated that the naturally aged specimen exhibited mainly <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">' (Al3Li) precipitates whose size appeared to be insensitive to pre-stretching. The moderate increase in yield strength by prestretching was attributed to work hardening effect. On the other hand, it was found that the precipitates of the artificially aged (at 180&#176;C) specimen were primarily T1 (Al2CuLi) phase. The size of the T1 precipitates decreased with increasing amount of pre-stretching. A pronounced increase in yield strength by pre-stretching was observed with the presence of fine T1 precipitates. The relationship between mechanical properties and microstructures will be discussed. This work was sponsored partially by the Louisiana Board of Reagent and DOE-SHaRE program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

EFFECT OF COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE ON THE STRENGTH AND FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF AL-CU-LI-AG ALLOYS:</B> <I>Cynthia L.

<P>
The use of Al-Cu-Li-Ag-Mg-Zr alloys for fabricating aerospace vehicle components can potentially reduce system weight. For damage tolerant analysis, it is important to characterize and understand alloy strength and fracture toughness, particularly as affected by minor changes in composition and test temperature. The uniaxial tensile deformation, plane strain fracture toughness, and plane stress tearing resistance of two precipitation hardened alloys, AA2095 and AA2195, were examined as a function of Cu and Li levels and temperature from -185&#176;C to 135&#176;C. As temperatures decreased, the crack initiation toughness of AA2095 declined mildly while the toughness of AA2195 increased mildly. Alloy AA2195 demonstrated superior toughness in all cases. For each alloy the elastic modulus, yield strength and work hardening coefficient increased with decreasing temperature, while ductility declined from 135&#176;C to -185&#176;C. A plastic strain-critical distance-based micromechanical model utilized these properties to predict that KICI increased mildly with declining temperature for each alloy. The slope of this trend was in good agreement with measurements for AA2195, but less so far AA2095. In all cases fracture occurred without delamination and by microvoid nucleation, growth and coalescence involving second phase particles which were particularly large in the higher Cu/Li variant (AA2095). This difference, along with separate relationships between nearest-neighbor particle spacing and the critical microstructural distance from the model explain the higher toughness of AA2195.

The effect of Be addition on the precipitation and mechanical properties of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys has been investigated by detailed transmission electron microscopy and hardness and tensile tests. It has been shown that the Be addition accelerates the aging response and improves the ductility while maintaining the strength of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys. Such improvements in mechanical properties are due to changes in precipitation behavior of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys by Be addition.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION AND GRAIN DISTRIBUTION IN SUPERPLASTICALLY FORMED AlLi 8090 ALLOY:</B> <I>Peter N. Kalu, </I> H. Garmestani, Department of Mechanical Engineering, FAMUFSU College of Engineering, 2525 Pottsdamer St., Tallahassee, FL 32310
<P>
With the advent of new analytical tools to study microstructures and microtexture, it is now necessary to re-characterize materials with complex structures. Using Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM), several microstructural parameters were obtained for superplastic Al-Li 8090 alloy deformed in tension. Grain orientation and distribution as well as the effective grain size based on standard definition of large angle grain boundaries were determined as a function of strain. The data was correlated with various models for superplasticity. The implications of the results on the deformation mechanisms operating during superplastic deformation is discussed.

DISLOCATION STRUCTURES PRODUCED DURING HIGH TEMPERATURE DEFORMATION OF ALLI AA8090 ALLOY: </B>W. Fan, M.C.

Richards, Bristol Aerospace Ltd, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3C 2S4
<P>
Deformation microstructures of an aluminum-lithium AA8090 SPF grade sheet have been studied by TEM. The alloy was deformed in tension at the superplastic deformation temperature of 530&#176;C and at a strain rate of 1x10-3/sec. The tensile testing machine was fitted with a specially designed in-situ water quenching apparatus to preserve the deformation microstructure produced at the temperature of testing. The TEM thin foils were made from samples deformed and in-situ quenched from different strain levels. Most of the thin foils were prepared with the surface parallel to the through thickness cross-section of the sheet, rather than parallel to the rolling plane. Dislocation pairs and dislocation networks were observed in the deformed samples even when deformation was as large as 475%. The observed characteristics of dislocation configuration suggest that dislocation interactions take place during superplastic deformation, in which grain boundary sliding is considered to play a dominant role and the role of dislocations is mainly to accommodate grain boundary sliding. In this paper, the possible implications of dislocation interactions and the mechanism of superplastic deformation in aluminum-lithium alloy AA8090 are discussed. <P>

DEFORMATION BEHAVIOUR OF 7075AL/ SICP COMPOSITE DURING MULTIPASS DEFORMATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES: </B> A. Razaghian, D. Yu, T. Chandra, Department of Materials Engineering, Wollongong University, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia<P>

Hot deformation behaviour of 7075 aluminium alloy containing 15 vol% of SiC particles (average size of 14 am) and the monolithic alloy was studied at 300 and 400&#176;C at constant strain rate of ls-1 under condition of uniaxial compression. The effect of delay between two consecutive passes on the high temperature mechanical strength and microstructural development was examined. The results showed that the fractional softening (%FS) increased in both reinforced and monolithic alloys when the deformation temperature increased from 300 to 400&#176;C, but monolithic alloy showed a slightly higher FS compared to composite under identical deformation conditions. TEM examination revealed that the monolithic alloy and composite contained almost similar substructures after either single or double pass deformation at a given temperature irrespective of interpass hold time. However, some subgrain growth was observed in these materials during holding after deformation at 400&#176;C, but this was not the case at 300&#176;C. The absence of subgrain growth at lower temperature can be attributed to pinning effect by fine dispersions present in the matrix. The structural study also showed that static recrystallization did not occur in these materials during hold time between passes, and the fractional softening occurs mainly due to static recovery.

WEAR PROPERTIES OF PARTICULATE REINFORCED ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>Yeong-gi Cho</I>, Su-young Kim, Ikmin Park, Kyungmox Cho, Dept. of Metallurgical Eng. Pusan National University, Pusan 609735, Korea<P>
Wear properties of cast AlSiCp composites were characterized under dry and lubricated conditions. Wear tests were performed employing blockonroller type and pinondisk type machines. Test conditions including applied load, sliding speed and sliding distance were changed for wear tests. Wear behavior was investigated by analyzing worn surfaces and debris, mainly as a function of the sliding speed. Results show that there exist transition speeds at which the minimum wear rate occurs for both dry and lubricated conditions. However the appearance of wear transition is not well defined for the lubricated wear. It was found that SiCp reinforcement affects wear at the low sliding speeds and the softening of Al matrix dominates wear at the high sliding speeds. Main wear mechanism is abrasive wear although some amounts of adhesive wear are observed especially at the high sliding speeds.

FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH BEHAVIOR OF DIECAST AND CAST SiC PARTICULATES REINFORCED ALUMINUM COMPOSITES:</B> Song-Hee Kim, Iee-Jeoung Kim, Department of Materials Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Kangwondo, Korea, 200701<P>
The fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) of SiC particulates reinforced aluminum matrix composites containing 10vol.% and 20vol.% of SiC fabricated by the casting and the die-casting processes have been studied over a wide range of stress intensity factor for various load ratios. The effect of volume fraction of SiC on FCGR was also investigated for the diecast and cast composites. Fracture toughness was found to affect the fatigue crack growth behavior at the higher level of stress intensity factor range; however, at lower level, fatigue crack roughness related with the volume fraction of SiC reinforcement was more responsible for the fatigue crack growth. Diecast composite with 20vol.% of SiC showed the superior fatigue crack propagation resistance at the lower level of AK, but the inferior resistance at the higher level of AK due to the decreased ductility and fracture toughness.

HIGH STRAIN RATE SUPERPLASTICITY OF DISCONTINUOUS FIBER REINFORCED PUR ALUMINUM COMPOSITES:</B> Tsunemichi Imai, Sumito Kojima, Isao Tochigi, Gilles L'Esperance, Bande Hong, Daming Jiang; National Industrial Research Institute of Nagoya, Hirate-cho, Kita-ku, Nagoya 462, Japan; Nagoy Minucipal Industrial Research Institute, 4-3-4 Rokuban-cho, Atsuta-ku, Nagoya 456, Japan; Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, PO Box 6079, Station A, Montreal (Quebec) Canada; Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China<P>

High Strain Rate Superplasticity (HSRS) of metal matrix composite has a great potential to apply to components and structures in automobile and aerospace industries and even semi-conductor packings since the composites exhibits excellent mechanical, physical and thermal properties. IN90 pure aluminum (Al) alone and AlN/1N90 pure Al composite made by PM method, and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-Si3N4w/99.99% pure Al composite fabricated by squeeze casting were hot-rolled after extrusion and the superplastic characteristics were investigated to clarify the deformation mechanism. IN90 Al alone hot-rolled about 773K could produce the m value of more than 0.3 and 300~450% at the strain rate of about 0.01s-1 and at 913~923K and also has threshold stress in the strain rate less than 0.01s-1. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-Si3N4w/99.9% pure Al composite exhibits the m value of 0.47 and the total elongation of about 200% at the strain rate of 0.5s-1 and at 903K. The results indicate that the HSRS could occur by grain boundary sliding without interfacial sliding at liquid phase, because the optimum temperature to produce the HSRS is just below incipient melting temperature.

FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF COBALT COATED Al203 SHORT FIBER REINFORCED 2024 Al COMPOSITE:</B> K.H. Baik*, E.S. Lee, and <I>S. Ahn</I>, Advanced Materials Division, Research Institute of Industrial Science and Technology, San 32, Hyojadong, Pohang, Kyungbuk 790330, Korea; *Dept. of Materials Science, Oxford University, UK<P>
The effect of chemical reaction at coating/fiber interface on the fracture behavior of 2024 Al alloy reinforced with Co coated Al2O3 fibers were investigated. Al2O3 fibers were coated with metallic Co by solgel process using Co acetate compound. The coated fibers were annealed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000&#176;C in vacuum to generate interfacial reaction between the Co coating and the Al2O3 fiber. Regardless of the annealing temperatures, a fair amount of solute Co was detected near the Al2O3 fiber surface ensuring the good bonding between the coating and the fiber. AlgCO2 and Co203 phases were formed at high annealing temperatures. SEM fractography of the composite showed the change of fracture behavior as a result of the interfacial reaction. Fiber debonding was frequently observed in the composite rein
 forced with fibers annealed at low temperatures. On the other hand, the composite with fibers annealed at higher temperatures had improved tensile strength, and showed much smaller dimples around the fibers and relatively less fiber pull-out. In-situ SEM fracture study was performed to understand the micro fractureprocess of the composite.

THE INFLUENCE OF SOLUTIONIZING TIME AND TEMPERATURE ON THE BONDING CHARACTERISTICS AND MICROSTRUCTURES BETWEEN THE PARTICLES AND MATRIX IN COMPOSITES WITH 6061 AND 2014 ALLOYS REINFORCED WITH ALUMINA PARTICLES:</B> Daniel Salas, Javier Ponce, Erica Corral, S.K. Varma, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0520<P>
The influence of solutionizing time and temperature on the microstructural development and bonding characteristics between the matrix and the particles will be characterized in composites with 6061 and 2014 aluminum alloys reinforced with 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 volume fractions of Ai2O 3 particles (VFAP) solutionized at 520, 530, and 540&#176;C for different times up to 20 hours to produce various grain sizes after quenching. The different heat treated samples after solutionizing v,/ill be subjected to room temperature tensile fracture at various strain rates (attainable in an Instron tensile testing machine) and the fracture surfaces will be characterized by SEM and related to the UTS. The samples deformed to various true strains will be analyzed in the TEM to determine the influence of solutionizing time on the microstructural development during the deformation. The results on the composites will be compared with similar treatments performed on the alloys in their monolithic forms in order to determine the deformation mechanisms in the composites. This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation through the grant number HRD9353547.

HOT DEFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF (SiCw+SiCp)/AA2124 COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Yeon-Chul Yoo</I>, ByungChul Ko, and Joon Park, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon 402751, Korea<P>
The hot deformation behavior of 15 vol.% (SiCw + SiCP.) reinforced AA2124 composites was investigated by hot torsion tests. The AA2124 Al based composites with different volume fractions of SiCw and SiCP reinforcements were fabricated by the powder metallurgy. Detailed analyses of flow curves and deformed microstructures were made to identify the hot restoration mechanism, such as dynamic recrystallization or dynamic recovery. Also, the dependence of flow stress and ductility on temperature and strain rate was studied. From the flow curves and microstructures of the hot deformed composites, it has been found that dynamic recrystallization was responsible for the hot restoration of the composites. The flow stress of the hybrid composites was higher than that of the monolithic AA2124 alloy. The flow stress and ductility of the hybrid composites were investigated with respect to the ratio of SiCw and SiCP, reinforcements.

ANALYSIS OF RESIDUAL STRESSED IN Ti-ALLOY, SCS-x MMC's BY NANOINDENTATION:</B> K.L. Kendig, R. Gibala, D.B. Miracle, B.S. Majumdar; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH; UES Inc., Dayton, OH<P>
Knowledge of variation of residual stresses aids in prediction of composite deformation and failure. Hardness measurements with high spatial resolution using extremely low load indentations, such as by nanoindentation techniques, may be an indicator of such variation of residual stresses. In this work, nanoindentation was used to determine hardness as a function of radial position from a fiber for a Ti6Al-4V, SCS-6 SiC fiber composite and a Ti-15V-3Al-3Cr-3Sn, SCS-0 SiC fiber composite, each in the as-consolidated condition. Residual stress predictions from a finite element model were compared to the hardness distributions obtained by nanoindentation. A small difference in nanoindentation hardness was found between the two phases of the Ti-6Al-4V matrix in the Ti-6Al-4V, SCS-6 composite, which likely masked any effects of residual stress on hardness. The Ti-15V-3Al-3Cr-3Sn, SCS-0 system was chosen to avoid this complication and to allow more direct correlation between predicted residual stress and nanoindentation hardness.

CREEP BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM STRENGHENING WITH VERY HIGH VOLUME FRACTIONS OF SUBMICRON ALUMINA PARTICLES:</B> <I>C. Verdon</I>, D.C. Dunand, Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, Room- 8-328, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
<P>
High-temperature mechanical properties of dispersion strengthened cast aluminum containing 0.3 &#181;m alumina particles were investigated. Compression creep tests were performed on samples containing three different volume fractions of oxide dispersoids, i.e. 25%, 33% and 43%, in the temperature range between 450&#176;C and 600&#176;C. Both as-cast materials, whose grain size in the range of centimeter, and extruded materials, which exhibit submicron grains, were tested. In the coarse-grained materials, the deformation is controlled by dislocation creep, whereas the deformation of the finegrained materials is controlled either by diffusional creep or by dislocation creep, depending on temperature and stress. The high values of the apparent stress exponents and of the apparent activation energy indicate a threshold stress for both creep regimes. Experimental results are discussed with respect to existing dispersion strengthening models.

To obtain a homogeneous distribution of fine Si particles in aluminum matrix, Si particulate reinforced aluminum matrix composites have been processed by using P/M method. 20-40&#181;m size Si particulates and Al alloy powders were mixed, degassed and extruded at 350&#176;C for pure Al matrix composites and at 400&#176;C for 2024 and 6061 matrix composites. Wear properties of the composites have been discussed in terms of the observed microstructural characteristics and physical properties such as tensile properties and thermal expansion coefficients.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT COMPOSITE MATERIALS WITH LOW COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION: </B>M. Smagorinslci, S. Grenier, P.G. Tsantrizos, PERMA, 1744 William, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H3J IR4
<P>
The aerospace industry uses several types of Al-based composite materials. The main criteria for their application are light weight, high strength and hardness, low CTE, and high dimensional stability (capability to keep dimensions unchanged under thermal load). Theoretical formulas were developed to calculate the CTE of binary composites, as well as the ideal diameter of the strengthening particles for composites working under stringent physical engineering conditions. The calculations which were performed permitted to select the volume fraction and the dimension of the reinforcing particles which offer the most potential. Based on these calculations, composites containing 40% of reinforcing particles were selected and produced using the Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS) method. The VPS netshape forming of composites was shown to possess distinct advantages over conventional manufacturing processes. The VPS technique can be used to fabricate advanced composites with complex shapes, high density (9798% of the theoretical density) and, uniform particles distribution of various ceramic materials (size and composition). Plastic deformation and heat treatment result in further density improvement, which in turn significantly improves the mechanical properties of the composites.

MICROSTRUCTURES AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DIE CAST SiCp/Al COMPOSITES:</B> Tae-Won Lee, Jun-Ho Seo, Chi-Hwan Lee, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon, Korea
<P>
This study was focused to investigate the effect of die casting parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of SiCp (10 and 20 vol%)/Al composites. Die casting was performed using the mold preheated at 130&#176;C under the pressure of 916 kg/m3 and pouring temperature of 650~700&#176;C. In this work, twostage injection system, which was composed of slow and high speed injections, was used to prevent the input of air during injection. The speeds of slow and high speed injections were 0.3~0.6 and 1.4 m/s, respectively. It was found that the SiC particles were homogeneously distributed in refined Al matrix. This results from the rapid mixing of Al and SiC particles during injection and the low segregation due to fast solidification rate. These microstructures provided good roomtemperature mechanical properties.

FABRICATION AND TENSILE PROPERTIES OF SiCP/AZ91 Mg COMPOSITES BY HOT EXTRUSION</B>: Doo-Myun Lee, Chi-Hwan Lee, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon, Korea
<P>
The tensile properties and microstructural evolution of hot-extruded SiCp/AZ91 Mg matrix composites have been investigated as functions of extrusion parameters and SiC particulate size. Also, the effect of SiC particulates on. the grain size of matrix in the composites was studied. The AZ91 Mg alloy powders prepared by wet attrition milling from Mg machined chips were hotpressed with and without SiC particulates, hot-extruded and then solutiontreated. The microstructural observation revealed that both the composites and Mg alloy have equiaxed grains due to the dynamic recrystallization during hot extrusion. The tensile strength of the both alloys increased with increasing extrusion ratio, and the strength of the composites were higher than that of the Mg alloy without reinforcement. It was found that the tensile strength of the both materials decreased after solutiontreatment; the decrease in tensile strength of the composites was considerably smaller than that of the Mg alloy. The grain growth of the matrix in the composites was inhibited by the introduction of the SiC particulates, resulting in the improvement in the yield strength of the composites.

IMPROVED HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE PROPERTIES OF TITANIUM-BASED PARTICULATES COMPOSITES: </B><I>I. Hagiwara</I>, S. Emura, Y. Kawabe, National Research Institute for Metals 1-2-1 Sengen, Tsuluba 305, Japan
<P>
The titaniumbased particulates composites are known to exhibit superior physical and mechanical properties compared to the unreinforced alloy. In cases where TiB<I> </I>or TiC is used as the reinforcing particulates, it has been reported that the fatigue fracture originates neither from the interior of particulate nor from the particulate/matrix interface, put rather from the matrix. Therefore it is suggested that the high cycle fatigue strength of the composite is strongly dependent on the matrix microstructure. In the present work, the effect of the matrix microstructure on the high cycle fatigue strength was studied for blended elemental P/M Ti6Al2Sn4Zr2Mo/lOTiB and Ti6Al1.7feO.lSi/10 TiB composites. It was found that the composites with a fine acicular <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> two-phase microstructure showed an improved high cycle fatigue strength over those for conventionally processed composites with colony matrix microstructure.

INFLUENCE OF FIBRE STRENGTH DISTRIBUTION ON THE FATIGUE BEHAVIOUR OF A TiB2 Is/SCS-6 COMPOSITE:</B> J. Liu, J.G. Pursell, P. Bowen, IRC for High Performance Materials/School of Metallurgy and Materials, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B 15 2TT, UK
<P>
The fatigue behaviour of silicon carbide fibre reinforced titanium matrix composites (TMCs) has been the subject of numerous studies. Bridging is found to he the dominant mechanism leading to the decrease in the crack growth rate us the fatigue crack grows. However, once the bridging fibres fail, the benefit of bridging will diminish. The influence of statistical fibre strength distribution on matrix cracking in fibre composites has been modeled by assuming the strength of the fibres falls in a twoparameter Weibull distribution. However, recent studies have shown that the fibre strength in TMCs is bimodal. The aim of this paper is to study the effects of fibre strength, and especially of those fibres with lower Weibull modulus. on the fatigue behaviour of a Ti,321s/SCS6 composite. First, single fibre tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the fibre strength distribution in both asreceived uncl fatigued specimens. The fracture surfaces of the fibres showing different strengths were examined using a SEM to distinguish lowstrength fibres fractographically. Fatigue tests were also conducted on single edge notched specimens. Different maximum loads and notch sizes were employed so that different fibre stresses were obtained. Acoustic emission, and direct current potential drop techniques were used to detect fibre failure and to monitor the crack growth. respectively. After the fatigue tests, the percentage of lowstrength fibres in the specimens was again estimated fractographically. The influence of fibre distribution was also modeled by characterizing the fibre strengths using two twoparameter Weibull distributions. The results show that the percentage of the lowstrength fibres plays an important role in determining the fatigue behaviour of the composite. Under identical loading condition, specimens with more lowstrength fibres are. of cause, more likely to fail. and this has been quantified.

AN EVALUATION OF THE DAMAGE TOLERANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF Ti6Al2Sn2Zr2Mo2Cr SHEET: </B>T.D. Bayha, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems<I>, </I>Marietta, GA 30063; D.L. Yaney, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Palo Alto, CA 94304
<P>
Ti-6Al-2Sn-2Zr-2Mo-2Cr (Ti-6-2-2-2-2) is an alpha-beta titanium alloy typically utilized in thick section, damage tolerance-driven aerospace applications. This alloy was developed for deep hardenability, with high strength, and moderate fracture toughness. Ti-62222, research efforts to date have been primarily focused on rolled plate and forged products; however, there is interest in developing thin sheet material for wing skin applications. A rolling practice to produce Ti-6-2-2-2-2 sheet materials for conventional and superplastically formed structure has been developed. The work described here characterizes the properties, microstructure, and fracture behavior or Ti-6&#173;2-2-2-2 solution treated and aged sheet samples subjected to tensile and cyclic loadings. Tensile and fatigue crack growth tests were performed over a wide temperature range (-65&#176;F to 500&#176;F) to assess the suitability of the sheet in various applications. Crack growth testing was performed utilizing two Rratios at each temperature of interest. Test data indicates that the crack growth behavior of Ti-6-2222 is superior to Ti-6Al-4V sheet in the Paris regime under comparable test conditions. A complete metallurgical analysis utilizing both scanning electron and transmission microscopy was conducted to develop property/microstructure relationships, and selected test specimens were examined to provide insight regarding fracture mechanisms with respect to typical cyclic loading conditions.

<P>
Present investigation has been made to study the superplastic deformation behavior of Ti-6AI4V alloy with respect to the variation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> volume fraction. Load relaxation tests were employed at 600 and 800&#176;C, to obtain stressstrain rate curves for the microstructures of 3 and 16&#181;m grain sizes. Superplastic deformation test was also carried out to confirm the results of load relaxation test. The experimental results were analyzed by the theory of inelastic deformation which consists of two mechanisms, i.e., one is the grain matrix deformation and the other is the phase/grain boundary sliding. Grain matrix deformation is dominant at 600&#176;C and well described by the state equation when permeability parameter, p, is 0.15. Phase boundary sliding is dominant at 800&#176;C and also consistent with the viscous flow equation with Mg=2.

CHARACTERIZATION OF INTERMETALLIC PRECIPITATES IN A <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha-bold.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta-bold.gif"> TITANIUM ALLOY: </B>X.D. Zhang*, J.M.K.

<P>
A two phase <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> titanium alloy, Ti6Al2Mo2Cr2Sn2Zr0.2Si (Ti-6-22-22S), has recently been reconsidered as a structural material for aircraft applications. This alloy exhibits specific strength and fracture toughness superior to that of Ti6A14V. However, similar to other alpha-beta titanium alloys, microstructural stability is one of the major concerns regarding industrial application of Ti62222S. For instance, precipitation of additional phases during long term high temperature exposure is predicted to affect significantly the performance of components in service. Three different precipitates have been observed in Ti-6-2222S alloys, namely silicides, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 phases. The presence of intermetallic precipitates, such as <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2, in the parent a matrix has been reported to result in brittle behaviour of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> alloys due to the formation of intense planar slip on {101U} prismatic planes. The present paper presents results of the characterization of intermetallic <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 precipitates in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> phase of Ti62222S by methods of scanning ant transmission electron microscopy (SISM and TEM respectively). The precipitation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 precipitates has been studied as a function of heat treatment conditions in order to examine the microstructural stability and growth behaviour. The observed dispersion of small, brittle intermetalllic precipitates is expected to have a detrimental effect on the fracture performance of Ti-6-22-22S. Hence, it is important to ascertain the origin of this precipitation phenomenon. The <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 precipitates have been characterized chemically and structurally by high spatial resolution microanalysis and high resolution electron microscopy.

CRACK PROPAGATION IN GRADIENT MICROSTRUCTURES IN TITANIUM ALLOYS</B>: <I>A. Berg,</I> J. Kiese, L. Wagner, Technical University of Brandenburg at Cottbus, 03013 Cottbus, Germany
<P>
Fatigue crack nucleation, microcrack growth and long crack growth are often oppositely affected by microstructural changes. For example, refining the microstructural unit size, e.g., grain size, improves the material's resistance to crack nucleation and microcrack growth, while long crack characteristics often deteriorate. To obtain optimum resistance of a component to various stages of fatigue life, microstructural gradients were developed in the near-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> titanium alloy TIMETAL 1100 and the metastable <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> alloy Ti3Al8V6Cr4Mo4Zr (Beta C) by thermomechanical treatments. In TIMETAL 1100, the prior <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> grain size of fully lamellar microstructures was varied from about 100 &#181;m at the surface of the component to about 500 &#181;m in the bulk, while for Beta C, the degree of age-hardening was varied over the cross section resulting in hardness values ranging from 700 HV 0.1 at the surface to 300 HV 0.1 in the bulk. Fatigue tests were performed in 3point bending using a servohydraulic testing machine. Optical microscopy was used to study fatigue crack nucleation and crack growth. The results are compared with nongradient references.

MECHANICAL AND THERMOMECHANICAL SURFACE TREATMENTS TO ENHANCE BCF STRENGTEI IN HIGHSTRENGTH-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta-bold.gif"> TITANIUM ALLOYS:</B> J. Kiese, W. Walz, <I>L. Wagner</I>, Technical University of Brandenburg at Cottbus, 03013 Cottbus, Germany
<P>
Shot peening and deep rolling with and without subsequent heat treatments were performed on various microstructures of the highstrength metastable <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> titanium alloys Ti3Al8V6Cr4Mo4Zr and TilOV2Fe3Al to improve the fatigue behavior. To evaluate optimum process parameters, a wide range of Almen intensities, rolling forces and annealing temperatures was chosen. The change in surface layer properties was evaluated by TEM, X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and microhardness measurements. Smooth and notched (K+ = 3.0) specimens were tested in rotating beam loading and the fatigue behavior was compared to the electrolytically polished reference. The results are explained in terms of the resistance to fatigue crack nucleation and microcrack growth as affected by the changes in near surface dislocation structure, residual compressive stresses and extensive precipitation hardening.

INVESTIGATION OF THE CREEP DEFORMATION MECHANISM OF THE LAMELLAR TiAl ALLOY MADE BY HOT EXTRUSION OF A BLENDED ELEMENTAL POWDER MIXTURE:</B> Soo Woo Nam, Han Seo Cho, SunKeun Hwang*, and Nack I. Kim**, Dept. of Mat. Sc. &amp; Eng., Korea Advanced Institute of Sci. &amp; Tech. Taejon 305-701, *Inha University, and **Pohang Univ. of Sci. &amp; Tech., Korea
<P>
Creep properties of the lamellar structured Ti46.6AI1.4Mn2Mo (at.&#176;/O) alloy, which is made by hot extrusion of a blended elemental powder mixture, are investigated in air environment over the temperature range from 750&#176;C to 900&#176;C at constant stress levels ranging from 100MPa to 250MPa. Average grain size of 150&#181;m is measured and the grain boundary phase is distributed inhomogeneously before the creep tests. The dislocation climb controlled creep deformation is suggested on the basis of the measured average activation energy for creep of 388kJ/mol and normalized stress exponent of 4.3 within the temperature range from 775&#176;C to 900&#176;C at stress level ranging from 150MPa to 250MPa. However, activation energy of 90kJ/mol within the temperature range of 750&#176;C to 775&#176;C and stress exponent of I.3 at 800&#176;C within the stress range of 100150MPa are measured. Microstructural studies conducted on the creep fractured specimens showed the secondary cracks along the lamellar grain boundaries and these secondary cracks are assumed to be formed by pore nucleation, growth and coalescence during the tertiary stage.

MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BINARY AND TERNARYALLOYED Al2Ti</B>: J.C. Ma, <I>J.E. Benci</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202
<P>
Polycrystalline binary Al2Ti was produced via casting or powder metallurgy and then further processed yielding material in six conditions. The yield strength as a function of test temperature and the room temperature fracture toughness were measured for these six material conditions. The fracture toughness values were determined from the critical load necessary to initiate cracks with a Vickers indenter. Both properties show a strong dependence on processing condition. Off-stoichiometric al2&#177;<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">Ti1&#177;<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> and ternary-alloyed Al2Ti + X were also produced, and samples in the as-cast and cast &amp; annealed conditions were prepared. The composition of the off-stoichiometric alloys was varied between 63 and 71 at% aluminum in 2% increments. Ternary-alloyed Al2Ti contains approximately 2 at% of either Si, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Nb, Mo or W. The room temperature hardness and fracture toughness and the room and elevated temperature yield strength were measured for each composition in both the as-cast and cast &amp; annealed material conditions. The effect of thermal mechanical processing, such as hot forging, on the room temperature properties was also investigated.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION DURING HIGH TEMPERATURE DEFORMATION OF <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAI INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS</B>: Hee Y. Kim, Woong H. Sohn, Soon H. Hong, Dept. of Mat. Sci. &amp; Eng., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, 305701, Korea
<P>
The microstructural changes during high temperature deformation behavior of Ti-(46,48)Al2W and Ti47Al2Cr4Nb intermetallic compounds have been investigated by isothermal compression tests at temperatures ranged from 1000&#176;C to 1200&#176;C with strain rates ranged 10-3/10-1/s-1. The stressstrain curve exhibited a peak stress then the flow stress decreased gradually into a steady state with increasing strain. The stressstrain curves showed a flow softening which is attributed to the dynamic recrystallization. The dependences of flow stress on temperature and strain rate were formulated using Zener-Hollomon parameter. The activation energies were measured as 437kJ/mol, 374kJ/mol and 300kJ/mol and the stress exponents were measured as 5.8, 5.3 and 4.9 for Ti46AI2W, Ti48AI2W and Ti47AI2Cr4Nb, respectively. The dynamically recrystallized microstructures were investigated and the relationships between recrystallized grain size and temperature compensated strain rate was discussed. The texture evolution during high temperature deformation was analyzed using the orientation distribution function (ODF). The controlling mechanisms during high temperature deformation of TiAl intermetallic compounds with varying temperature, strain and strain rate were discussed.

COMPARISON OF FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH RESISTANCE OF GAMMA ALUMINIDES AND Ti-BASED ALLOYS:</B> S. Lesterlin, C. Mabru, C. Sarrazin, G. Henaff, J. Petit, Laboratoire de Mechanique et de Physique des Materlaux, URA CRNS 863 ENSMA, BP 109, 86960 Futuroscope, France
<P>
Gamma aluminides present attractive properties for high temperature structural applications and could be adopted against traditional titanium alloys. The resistance to fatigue crack growth is critical against traditional titanium alloys. The resistance to fatigue crack growth is critical for aeronautical applications. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of long cracks in Titanium Aluminides (lamellar and fully <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) is compared, based on microstructure, temperature and environment criteria, with five conventional Titanium alloys in different thermomechanical conditions. At room temperature, higher threshold (related to enhanced near-threshold contribution of crack closure) and lower KIC contributes to much more steep propagation curves on TiAl. At high temperature in air, the crack growth regime identifies on Ti alloys as a corrosion-fatigue mechanism assisted by water vapor is shown to be also oporative for TiAl alloys. In all the cases, the propagation of fatigue cracks in both types of materials seems to be governed by the same mechanisms and the TiAl alloys appears to be more sensitive to moisture than Ti based alloys.

ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATION IN Ti 6246 at 500&#176;C:</B> J. Petit, C. Sarrazin-Baudoux, S. Lesterlin, Y. Chabanne, Laboratoire de Mechanique et de Physique des Materlaux, UFA CNRS 863, ENSMA, BP 109, 86960 Fuuturoscope, France
<P>
The fatigue and crack propagation behavior of Ti 6246 alloys elaborated with a fine Windmanstatten microstructure, has been investigated at 500&#176;C. Tests were performed in air, high vacuum (10-4 Pa), low vacuum (1Pa) and humidified Argon (100 Pa and atmospheric pressure). Partial pressures of water vapour and oxygen were controlled by mean of hygro-metals and mass spectrometer. Crack closure was detected using a capacitive gauge mounted at the mouth of the notch of CT specimens. The enhancement of the crack growth rates in the mean-threshold area and the mid-rate range observed in the different environments in comparison to high vacuum, is clearly related to the presence of water vapor even at very low partial pressure. Critical conditions (partial pressure, frequency, closure, load ratio) for the occurrence of water vapor assisted corrosion-fatigue, creep-fatigue and stress-corrosion are explored, and the specific role of oxygen and water vapor is discussed on the basis of microfractographic observations, fracture surface analysis (R.B.S. technique) and closure measurements.

EFFECT OF PROCESSING VARIABLES ON MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF RHEOCAST AZ9ID Mg ALLOYS:</B> C.D. Yim, K.S. Shin, School of Materials Science and Engineering and Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Seoul National University, Shinrim-dong, Seoul, Korea
<P>
Rheocast ingots of an AZ9 ID magnesium alloy were produced with different processing conditions. Processing variables included stirring rate (Vs) and stirring temperature (Ts). The microstructures of the rheocast AZ9lD magnesium alloys were similar to those of composite materials consisted of soft primary particles distributed in the hard matrix. A detailed examination was made on the relation between processing variables and mechanical properties. With increasing Vs and Ts, the size and the solid volume fraction of the soft primary particles decreased and the hardness and the UTS of the rheocast alloys increased. The mechanical properties of the rheocast alloys were analyzed quantitatively as a function of microstructural parameters such as the size and the solid volume fraction of the primary particles.

DEFORMATION MECHANISMS AND MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF A NOVEL IN-SITU Be-Al COMPOSITE:</B> X.D. Zhang1, J.M.K. Wiezorek1, G. Meyrick1, F.C. Grensing2, H.L. Fraser1, 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2041 College Rd., Columbus, OH 43210; 2Brush Wellman, 14710 West Portage River South Rd., Elmore, OH 43416<P>
There has been considerable interest in the production of light weight composite materials for aerospace applications. One of the promising candidates is an in-situ composite consisted of Be and Al. This material combines a high elastic modulus, low density with a relatively high melting point. Unlike the brittle Be, which does not undergo extensive plastic deformation prior to failure, the Be-Al alloys examined in the present study exhibit a remarkable formability. Both extruded and rolled products have been prepared successfully. However, the mechanisms responsible for these attractive characteristics of the Be-Al alloys have not yet been identified. Thus, it is timely and important to ascertain the active deformation modes governing the deformation charac teristics of Be when present in a continuous matrix of aluminum. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine the effect of the aluminum on the inhibition of initiation of cleave in the Be-Al alloys. In the present paper, we will present the results on the microstructural characterization of mechanically tested samples using SEM and TEM. The deformation behavior has been studied by SEM based fractography and TEM based on defects analyses. The observed fracture mechanisms will be discussed in terms of dislocation mobilities in the Al and the BE phase respectively.

EFFECT OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZE CAST MgAl ZnX ALLOYS:</B> Jae Joong Kim, Do Hyang Kim*, Sang Hyuk Kim, Nack J. Kim, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790784, Korea, *Dept. of Metallurgical Eng., Yonsei Univ., Shinchondong, Seodaemunku, Seoul, Korea<P>
Mg alloys offer the potential for significant weight savings in aerospace components because of their low density. Nevertheless, there is a strong need for Mg alloys with much improved mechanical properties. The main objective of the present research is to improve the mechanical properties of Mg alloys by squeeze casting and by alloy modification. The addition of Si results in the formation of Mg2Si in two morphologies; polygon and chinese script. While the polygonal Mg2Si improves the mechanical properties of Mg alloys, the chinese script Mg2Si promotes the brittle fracture along the Mg2Si/matrix interface, resulting in poor ductility. Microalloying elements have been added to modify the morphology of chinese script Mg2Si. It has been shown that the additions of Ca or P eliminate the chinese script Mg2Si so that all of the Mg2Si particles are present in polygonal form, resulting in the improvement of mechanical properties.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODELING OF SUPERPLASTICITY:</B> F. Booeshaghi, H. Garmestani, P. N. Kalu, Department of Mechanical Engineering, FAMUFSU College of Engineering, Tallahassee, FL<P>
There has been an increased interest in the mechanics and materials field to improve the constitutive relations for the superplastic deformation of advanced materials. This interest has been stimulated partly due to the discovery of high strain rate superplasticity, and partly due to the availability of powerful computers. In this paper, an attempt was made to develop new type of constitutive relations to elucidate superplasticity. Although the model was derived from Hart's model, it incorporates detailed microstructural parameters and can be extended to multiaxial deformation. An attempt was made to use the model to explain the deformation mechanisms in superplastic AlLi 7475 and Al-Li 8090 alloys. Load relaxation and jump strain rate tests were employed in this investigation. Microstructural characterization was carried out by optical nicroscopy and orientation Imaging Microscopy.

WATERJET ABRASIVE APPLICATIONS FOR LIGHT WEIGHT ALLOYS</B>: <I>Lin Zhong Lee</I>, Laser Applications, Inc., Westminster, MD 21157<P>
As the aerospace applications of light weight alloys expand, waterjet abrasive process is a viable approach to manufacturing. This technology utilizes high pressurized water and an abrasive passing through a nozzle that is capable of cutting most materials up to 9&quot; thick. It provides precision cutting of any contour, shape, and size which will allow engineers and designers the freedom to create more complex designs. The main components of a waterjet system consist of an ultrahigh pressure intensifier, a cutting head, and a CNC controller. The jet parameters consist of the water pressure, orifice size, nozzle size, abrasive type, abrasive flow rate and cutting head feedrate. The kinetic energy is created from the mass of the water and abrasive exiting the nozzle at twice the speed of sound. At this high velocity, the jet stream acts like a solid medium that erodes the material. The efficiency of the waterjet is dependent on the initial energy leaving the nozzle and the energy required to remove the material. Therefore, it is easier to cut a soft and thin material than a hard and thick material. Through this process, superior edge quality is achieved with no heat affect zone (HAZ), no metal contamination, no distortion, no slag, and no delamination.

MICROMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF ADHESION STRENGTH FOR A BRITTLE FILM COATED SUBSTRATE:</B> Jeunghyun Jeong, HaeSeok Park, JeongHoon Ahn and Dongil Kwon, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151742, Korea<P>
In this work, we attempted to estimate the interface adhesion strength through the stress analysis in a brittle film coated substrate by two methods: scratch method and film cracking method. Firstly, in a scratch test, the critical load used as a qualitative estimate of adhesion is converted into work of adhesion by analyzing the stress field beneath the indenter, which results from three contributions, i.e., the static indentation added by the blister stress field, the friction between the indenter and film, and the residual stress. Secondly, in uniaxial loading of a brittle film coated soft substrate, the adhesion dependency of the development behavior of the transverse film cracks is analyzed specifying the film tensile stress and the interface shear stress which induce film cracking and interface failure, respectively. Then, the interface adhesion is quantified as interface shear strength because the stoppage of film cracking with further straining means the interface failure by the excessive interface shear stress, and the saturated value of crack spacing and strain can be used for the qualitative comparison of adhesion.

ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSED CALIBRATION OF THIN ALUMINUM ALLOYS SHELLS:</B> <I>Sergey F. Golovashchenko, </I>Moscow State Technical University, visiting at Ford Motor Company Scientific Lab Material Science Department, 20000 Rotunda Dr., P.O.Box 2053,MD3182, SRL, Dearborn, MI 481212053<P>
Pulsed electromagnetic field have been used to size thinwalled shells inside calibration dies. This works even when the shell have been formed by bending sheet metal and closed by a welding seam. Deformation is accomplished by a highvoltage discharge of capacitors through a coil inside the shell. Experimental results for AlCuFeM high strength alloy rings are presented. They show a significant improvement of the accuracy of shell dimensions with increasing pressure amplitude. Results of the numerical simulation of the shell-die contact interaction are obtained assuming that shell is elastoplastic and the die is elastic. Solid mechanics equation of motion and elastoplastic flow rule have been used to simulate this process. This simulation takes account of multiple impacts, spring back, stress waves in shell and die and has been experimentally validated.

DEVELOPMENT OF DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED BLADES AND VANES FOR LAND BASE TURBINE: </B><I>Hisataka Kawai</I>, Kohji Takahashi, Ikuo Okada, Taiji Trigoe, Akira Mitsuhashi; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd, Takasago Research &amp; Development Center, 2-1-1 Shinhama Arai-Cho, Takasago, Hygo Pref. 676 JAPAN; Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, 1-297 Kitabukuro-Cho Omiya, Saitama 330, Japan
<P>
Directionally solidified blades and vanes, so-called DS blades and vanes, have already been used in jet engines, but seldom in land-base gas turbines, because there are large differences in the size of hot parts, fuel and so on between jet engines and land-base gas turbines. It is necessary to take these differences into account when developing DS blades and vanes for land-base gas turbines. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. started to develop DS blades some years ago. First, material properties, such as, tensile strength, creep rupture, fatigue, other physical properties, etc, were investigated. Then, the optimization of casting conditions for large size blades (501FG/T 1st blade) was conducted. Finally, actual DS blades were cast and it was confirmed their material properties were excellent. Also their machinability and coating were evaluated and good results were obtained. As a result, DS blades were installed in an actual gas turbine (MF111G/T) in January 1994 which have been in operation since then.

<P>MICROSTRUCTURAL STABILITY OF ADVANCED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOYS: </B><I>W.S. Walston</I>, GE Aircraft Engines, 1 Neumann Way, M85, Cincinnati, OH 45215
<P>
Microstructural stability is a key parameter in the development and application of single crystal superalloys. The formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases occurs to some degree in most single crystal superalloys. The effect of these phases on properties will be discussed. In addition, the effects of time and temperature on the formation of TCP phases will be shown for a recent single crystal superalloy, Ren&eacute; N6. Another form of microstructural instability has recently been observed in high refractory content single crystal superalloys. This instability, termed SRZ, is a cellular phase transformation that can occur either beneath coatings or in the alloy substrate. The occurrence and effects of this instability in various alloys will be discussed. The third form of microstructural instability observed in several single crystal superalloys is the conversion of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> matrix with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 precipitates to a microstructure with a continuous <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase. Several examples of this behavior will be shown. The relationship between this form of instability, rafting and creep rupture properties will also be discussed.

<P>THE EFFECT OF CAST SIZE ON HOT CORROSION RESISTANCE OF SINGLE CRYSTAL NICKEL BASED SUPERALLOY CMSX-4: </B><I>Ming Li,</I> V. Desai, Mechanical Materials and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816; N.S. Cheruvu, Southwest Research Institute, 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio TX 78228
<P>
Advanced single crystal (SC) nickel based superalloys have been available in small cast size for aero engine applications for a long time. Where as the SC techniques are not yet widely used in the land based engine components because of their much larger size which makes casting and the subsequent heat treatment more difficult. The difference in defects, such as microporosity, segregation, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 eutectic, and dendritic structure, derived from casting size differences will affect the heat treatment process and the subsequent service properties, including hot corrosion/oxidation behavior. Hot corrosion tests were carried out at 900, 950, and 1000&#176;C on specimens coated with NasSO4 in air. Three different kinds of specimens; as-cast and heat treated CMSX-4 from small and large blades, and IN738, were used to study the effects of cast defects and heat treatment on hot corrosion behavior and to compare the hot corrosion resistance of the single crystal superalloy with a typical land based turbine material. The corrosion product morphology, microstructure and composition were investigated using metallography and SEM/EDS. It is concluded that although the hot corrosion resistance of this single crystal material is not as good as that of IN738, proper heat treatment can double its hot corrosion resistance.

<P>RELIABILITY OF A SINGLE CRYSTAL NIAL ALLOY FOR GAS TURBINE APPLICATIONS: </B><I>R. D. Noebe</I>, J. Salem, J. Manderscheid, NASA Lewis Research Center, M.S. 24-1, Cleveland, OH 44135; R. Darolia, General Electric Aircraft Engine Co., Cincinnati, OH 45215
<P>
Due to numerous property advantages, NiAl single crystal alloys are being investigated as a replacement for Ni-based single crystal superalloys in high pressure turbine engine sections, however, the current drawback is their lack of ductility. Consequently, a significant effort is being made to develop testing and design methodologies that will account for this lack of ductility. The present approach is to modify existing test methods and brittle design methodologies, such as those in the Ceramic Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures (CARES) code, and to experimentally verify the results. To this end, the statistical nature and source of fracture in a high-strength, single crystal NiAl alloy has been studied via flexural testing of 3- and 4-point bend specimens of various crystallographic orientations. Flexural strength results indicate a wide dispersion in strength that can be characterized via normal or Weibull statistics. While the fracture strength was function of orientation, the Weibull modulus was not. Failure origins were determined for most of the specimens tested. In all cases, failure occurred from singular carbide particles or machining damage. It was also determined that the Weibull scaling law applies to uniaxial cases for effective surface area changes of 300% or less.

<P>EFFECT OF SOLUTION HEAT TREATMENT ON DS TRANSVERSE STRENGTH: </B><I>H. Tamaki</I>, A. Yoshinari, A. Okayama, N. Watanabe, M. Kobayashi, Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan
<P>
It is well known that creep-rupture strength of nickel-base superalloys strongly depends on the conditions of solution heat treatment. Jackson et al. 1 showed that creep-rupture life of MAR M 200 Hf DS in longitudinal direction increased with increasing volume fraction of fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 upon solution heat treatment. On the other hand, Cetel and Duhl 2 showed that creep ductility of PWA1426 DS in transverse direction decreased with increasing volume fraction of fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1. In this study, in order to investigate the effect of solution heat treatment on DS transverse strength, CM186LC DS which is usually used without solution heat treatment was solution heat treated at 1548K for different time periods. Results are summarized as follows. (1) Creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in longitudinal direction increased by solution heat treatment. (2) Creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in transverse direction decreased by solution heat treatment. (3) Boron at grain boundaries diffused into grains by solution heat treatment. This phenomenon possibly caused the decrease of creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in transverse direction.

<P>
Modern gas turbine components must possess unique combination of various high temperature strength and corrosion resistance properties for providing increased efficiency and reliability of operation. Some of these properties, which a material must have are good isothermal and cyclic oxidation resistance, good carburization resistance, good thermal stability, good stress rupture and fatigue strength and most importantly, good fabricability and weldability. Alloy 603GT is a new cobalt free nickel base alloy especially developed for modern gas turbine components. Its basic composition of high chromium, high aluminum, high carbon (25 Cr, 2.6 Al, 0.3 C, 0.1 Y, 9 Fe, Ni balance) and micro alloying with titanium and zirconium, gives this alloy a unique combination of excellent high temperature strength and superior oxidation resistance, carburization resistance, good thermal stability, grain growth resistance and spallation resistance. It's development, properties and cost effectiveness are discussed.

MODELING ENGINE COMPONENT CREEP DEGENERATION: </B><I>A.K. Koul,</I> X.J. Wu, Structures and Materials Propulsion Laboratory, Institute of Aerospace Research, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A0R6
<P>
The paper presents a mechanistic approach to modeling creep degeneration of superalloy components with a view to developing residual life prediction algorithms. In accordance with the deformation decomposition rule: E = Eg + Egbs, we classify degeneration mechanisms into two categories: 1) grain boundary deformation controlled degeneration mechanisms, including grain boundary sliding (GBS), cavitation and GBS assisted oxidation; and 2) intragranular deformation controlled degeneration mechanisms. The evolutionary creep equation for each strain component is thus mechanism-based. Generally, GBS is responsible for the transient, while intragranular deformation mechanisms, particularly dislocation glide-plus-climb and dislocation multiplication, contribute to tertiary creep deformation during short term tests. When coupled with cavitation and oxidation, GBS also contributes to tertiary creep. The total creep strain is a result of the summation of all above contributions, and the entire creep, as a continuous process, is thus described. Superimposed on these mechanisms are various fracture criteria to predict the eventual event of creep rupture.

THE EFFECT OF DEFECTS ON THE LCF BEHAVIOR OF AN ADVANCED SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY: </B><I>K.A. Dannemann</I>, H. Jang, W.T. King, GE Power Generation, Schenectady, NY 12345
<P>
The defect propensity in single crystal castings is enhanced with increased casting size. As the industrial gas turbine community moves towards the application of large single crystal castings, there is increasing concern regarding the effects of grain and casting defects on part life. Although aircraft engine experience provides a basis for single crystal grain limits, the cycle and life requirements of large industrial gas turbines differ considerably. The effect of several types of defects on the low cycle fatigue behavior of an advanced single crystal alloy will be discussed. Tests were run on cast-to-size LCF bars with intentional defects (freckles, inclusions, low angle boundaries, recrystallized grains, slivers, mis-oriented grains) in the gage section. A correlation between defect size and LCF life was observed. Work to date indicates LCF life is more dependent on defect size than type.

HOT FORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF NI-BASE SINGLE CRYSTAL SUPERALLOY CMSX-6: </B><I>D. Zhao</I>, H. Dong, M. Zelin, A. Dalley, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 1450 Scalp Ave., Johnstown, PA 15904
<P>
High temperature deformation processing of Ni base single crystal superalloy CMSX-6 has been shown to be a feasible process. However, it is essential that the single crystal material be deformed at a low strain rate and within an appropriate temperature range to prevent recrystallization and fracture. In order to establish these limits, the hot forming behavior of Ni base single crystal superalloy CMSX-6 was investigated by performing high temperature compression, bending, and rolling tests. Stepwise deformation and annealing tests were also conducted to simulate multi-pass rolling practice. The flow stress and recrystallization behavior were characterized over a range of temperatures, strain rates, and strains. Metallurgical phenomena, such as changes in size and morphology of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles, orientation change of the single crystal specimens, subgrain boundary formation, recovery, and recrystallization, occurred during the high temperature deformation processes. These phenomena were analyzed to understand their influence on forming of single crystals. Deformation at too high temperatures resulted growth of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles and deteriorated the service properties of single crystals. Highly mis-oriented subgrain formation around <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles lead to recrystallization. Deformation mechanisms were investigated by analyzing the results of compression and indentation tests. The primary slip systems activated were of (111)&lt;110&gt; type. This work was conducted by the National Center for Excellence in Metalworking Technology, operated by Concurrent Technologies Corporation under contract No. N00140-92-C-BC49 to the U.S. Navy as part of the U.S. Navy Manufacturing Technology Program.

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS OF A NI-MO-CR ALLOY: </B><I>W.C. Johnson</I>, D.L. Klarstrom, Haynes International, 1020 W. Park Avenue, P.O. Box 9013, Kokomo, IN 46904; M. Dollar, Haynes International, Engineering 1 Bldg., 10 W. 32nd Street, Chicago, IL 60616 <P>

The high temperature, age hardenable, Ni-Mo-Cr alloy HAYNES 242 shows a change in deformation characteristics dependent upon the testing temperature. Aged material shows microtwinning to be a dominant deformation mechanism at all testing temperatures. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of slip at room temperature and elevated temperature. Grain boundaries also seem to play a role in the fracture propagation mechanism at work in tested samples. Samples in the aged condition fracture with a combined mode of dimple rupture and cleavage as opposed to annealed samples which fracture through a dimple rupture mode alone. The fracture surface shows microvoid coalescence but the fracture takes place in a shear-type mode as opposed to the traditional cup and cone ductile fracture.

SOLID PARTICLE EROSION RESISTANCE OF IRON, NICKEL AND COBALT-BASED ALLOYS:</B> <I>B.F. Levin</I>, J.N. DuPont, A.R. Marder, Lehigh University, Energy Research Center, Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
The erosion behavior of commercially available iron, nickel and cobalt-based alloys was evaluated and a relative ranking of their erosion resistance was developed. Microhardness tests were conducted in the vicinity of the eroded surface to measure the size of the plastic zone beneath the eroded surface. It was found that all alloys deformed plastically and a new toughness parameter has been proposed which shows good correlation with erosion resistance. To find a relationship between mechanical properties and erosion resistance, elevated temperature mechanical test were conducted for all alloys. The erosion resistance of tested materials exhibited good correlation with their tensile toughness. Relationships between the ability of materials to deform plastically, mechanical properties (i.e., hardness and tensile properties) and erosion resistance are discussed.

THERMAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THERMAL BARRIER COATING ON CU-SUBSTRATE PREPARED BY DETONATION-GUN THERMAL SPRAY METHOD: </B><I>Y.M. Rhyim</I>, H.W. Jin, C.G.

Thermal barrier coating (TBC) consisting of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 top coat on a MCrAlY bond coat has been developed for thermal protection of hot components used in steel plant, especially the tuyeres in blast furnace. Since the tuyere is used under extremely harsh chemical environment and high temperature (up to 2300&#176;C) within the blast furnace, it is essential to develop a strong and tough protective coating, that is fully compatible to the tuyere's pure copper substrate, by applying the detonation-gun thermal spray method. As fuel gas amount increased, the porosity of MCrAlY coat layer generally decreased to less than 1%, but microcracks can be formed with extreme fuel gas amount. The metallic bond coat with the thickness greater than 100 &#181;m is required to sustain the ceramic top coat. In obtaining the best top coat, the spraying condition with maximum detonation temperature was found as an optimum condition from the computer simulation. A partially stabilized zirconia top coat layer deposited by this condition exhibited the low porosity with high hardness (~640 DPH) which is better than the coating made by plasma spraying. The thermal fatigue resistance of the present TBC was revealed to depend on both the thickness of ceramic top coat and the composition of the stabilizer. The result on the thermal conductivity is also discussed.

Multilayer, graded thermal barrier coatings have been fabricated using electrochemical methods. The inner two layers of the coatings are electro-deposited from aqueous baths and consist of 18 vol. % Al and 20 vol. % Al + 7 vol. % alumina, respectively, in a Ni matrix. The outer two layers are electrophoretically deposited form non-aqueous baths and contain an oxidation-resistant alumina 1 zirconia layer and a thermal-resistant yttria-stabilized zirconia outer layer, respectively. The alumina + zirconia layer was formed by reaction bonding of an aluminum-alumina-zirconia precursor powder. In addition to the details of the fabrication, the results of thermal cycling and mechanical testing of these four-layer coatings will be presented.

Many potential applications of electron beam evaporation demand tight compositional control in the deposits and high deposition rates. Adding tungsten to nickel-based evaporation pools can increase evaporation rates and improve compositional control in deposits. Effects of tungsten addition on several alloys, NiCoAl, NiCoCr, and NiCrAl were investigated. Magnitudes of compositional gradients in the deposits, measured using electron microprobe techniques, were used to evaluate the sensitivity of vapor cloud chemistry to fluctuations in processing parameters. Compositional and microstructural gradients in quenched evaporation pools, studied using microprobe and SEM, yielded information about the evolution of steady state in the pools. Tungsten distributions in the pools, which may significantly affect temperature distribution, fluid flow, and heat transfer, were mapped using back scattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Currently, pool surface temperatures are being mapped using an infrared imaging radiometer and effects of refractory additives other than tungsten are being evaluated.

RF MAGNETRON SPUTTERING OF MOSI2+X SIC COMPOSITE THIN FILMS: </B><I>S. Govindarajan</I>, J.J. Moore, Advanced Coatings and Surface Engineering Laboratory, Dept. of Met. &amp; Materials Eng., T.R. Ohno, Dept. of Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO 80401-1887
<P>
A critical component of a prototype coating system being developed to protect molybdenum against high temperature oxidation (i.e. at 1600&#176;C for 500 hours) is a functionally graded layer based on MoSi2+x SiC (where x is the variable mole fraction of SiC in the film). Different approaches for synthesizing composite films include sputtering from elemental or compound targets, reactive sputtering, and direct sputtering of composite targets. This paper will explore the feasibility of synthesizing composite films by RF magnetron sputtering of a composite target. Results of compositional depth profiling using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, microstructural evaluation and X-Ray diffraction analyses of the films will be presented. In particular, the diffusion of silicon and carbon in to the substrate will be characterized using a &quot;ball-cratering&quot; technique followed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique will help to overcome the disadvantages associated with ion-beam sputtering during depth profiling (e.g. different sputter yields for the constituent elements, interface broadening effects, etc.).

THE EFFECT OF THICKNESS AND TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT ON PWA1480 OXIDATION: A SCALE ADHESION MAP:</B> <I>J.L. Smialek</I>, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH 44135<P>
The cyclic oxidation resistance of advanced superalloys is dramatically improved when the typical sulfur impurity levels are reduced from about 3-10 ppmw to below 1 ppmw. Optimum scale adhesion can be obtained when the sulfur content is reduced below a discreet critical level. To demonstrate this phenomenon, coupons of PWA1480 were desulfurized by a hydrogen annealing process. The degree of desulfurization was controlled by sample thickness and annealing time and temperature, but did not strictly follow a Dt/L2 diffusion parameter dependency. From an initial sulfur value of 6 ppmw, 15 different sulfur levels were produced ranging from 0.05 to 4 ppmw. Cyclic oxidation resistance in 1100&#176;C tests improved directly with the degree of desulfurization, reaching an optimum below about 0.2 ppmw. Furthermore, at equivalent sulfur levels, thick samples were prone to greater weight loss than thin samples. The results are discussed in terms of an adhesion map based on the equivalent number of interfacially segregated monolayers of sulfur.

ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF GAS TURBINE MATERIALS IN STEAM: </B> <I>Y. Patel</I>, D.C. Tamboli, V.

Steam has been proposed as an efficient cooling medium for the hot section components in the advanced gas turbines as an option for more efficient cooling allowing them to operate at higher efficiency. However, the effects of steam and its impurities such as NaCl and Na2SO4 on the environmental degradation of gas turbine superalloys is little known. Three common gas turbine superalloys; X-45, IN-738 and Inconel-617 were exposed to steam at higher temperature. Cylindrical specimens with central bore were kept at elevated temperature and exposed to three steam environments flowing through the bore. The three environments are (a) steam generated from deionized water, (b) steam generated from deionized water with 5ppm each of NaCl and Na2SO4 and (c) steam generated from deionized water with 50ppm each of NaCl and Na2SO4. The respective exposure times were 1450, 2950 and 3900 hours. IN-738 showed severe internal oxidation in steam without contaminants. In contaminated steam the hot corrosion damage was maximum in Inconel-617. X-45 showed less oxidation damage than IN-738 and less hot corrosion than Inconel-617.

THE OXIDE LAYER PHASE STRUCTURE OF MCRALY-COATINGS: </B> <I>N. Czech</I>, W. Stamm, Siemens AG Power Generation Group, and B. Kolarik, Fraunhofer-Institute for Chemical Technology<P>
During service blades and vanes of stationary gas turbines are subjected to high temperatures. The increase in surface temperatures causes a more severe attack on the MCrAlY-coatings. These coatings are taken for bond coats for thermal barrier coatings as well. The production of a homogeneous oxide layer during service is necessary for a good oxidation protection and for a good adhesion to the ceramic. We will present in-situ X-ray measurements on 8% and 12% Al containing MCrAlY-coatings with and without Re at three different temperatures versus time. At lower temperatures mainly a two phase mixture of Cr2O3 and Al2O3 is detectable with different size distributions for the coatings with 8% and 12% Al. On microsections the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-phase depletion is analyzed. At 1050&#176;C a pure Al2O3 oxide layer is established. No Re can be found in the top layer.

THE EFFECT OF RHODIUM WEIGHT PERCENT ON THE OXIDATION RESISTANCE OF PLATINUM RHODIUM MODIFIED ALUMINIDE COATINGS ON MAR M-509 AND FSX-414 COBALT BASE ALLOYS:  </B> <I>J. Kimmel</I>, Z. Mutasim, Solar Turbines, Inc., 2200 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92186-5376<P>
Cobalt based alloys such as Mar-M 509 and FSX-414 are coated with a precious metal aluminide (platinum-rhodium-aluminide) to provide enhanced oxidation and hot corrosion resistance in gas turbine applications. The role of rhodium in the aluminide coating is not well understood. There is limited data suggesting that it provides added oxide adherence and reduced refractory element diffusion from the base alloy too the coating interface, thus reducing the tendency of spallation during high temperature exposure. However, too high of a rhodium content decreases the ductility of the coating and, after cyclic oxidation, may result in coating cracking and spallation. The objective of this study is to evaluate platinum-rhodium-aluminide optimum rhodium weight percentage on Mar-M 509 and FSX-414 cobalt based alloys. Metallurgical evaluation was performed on platinum rhodium aluminide coatings with varying rhodium weight variation between 0% and 10%. Oxidation tests were performed at 2000&#176;F/1000 hours, 2100&#176;F/1000 hours (100 hour cycles). Characteristics such as coating thickness, composition, microstructure, and weight changes were evaluated for the as-coated and oxidized specimens using SEM and EDX analysis.

HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION OF NICKEL BASED SUPERALLOYS IN STEAM: </B> <I>V. Desai</I>, D.C. Tamboli, Mechanical Materials and Aerospace Engineering Dept., University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816; N.S. Cheruvu, Southwest Research Institute, 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX 78228<P>
An improvement in the cooling of hot gas path components of the has turbines has been sought by replacing air with steam as a cooling medium. However the materials problems associated with steam at high temperature are unknown for gas turbine superalloys. This information is very crucial for the reliability and life prediction of the gas turbine components. In this study, oxidation in steam has been studied for four nickel based superalloys commonly used in the gas turbines, IN738, Inconel 617 and CMSX-4. The study was carried out at four different test temperatures within the range of 800&#176;C to 950&#176;C for times up to 1400 hours. The oxidation tests were also carried out in air to provide a comparison between the oxidation in steam and air. The results indicated higher internal oxidation in IN738 compared to other two alloys. The oxidation attack observed in IN738 was higher in steam compared to air, whereas in other alloys reverse was the case.

NITRADATION AND MECHANICAL DEGRADATION OF COATINGS IN GAS TURBINE BLADES: </B><I>J. Kameda,</I> T.E. Bloomer; Ames Laboratory &amp; CATD, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011; S. Sakurai, Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., 3-1-1, Saiwai Hitachi 317, Japan<P>
In-service environmental attack and mechanical degradation of CoNiCrAlY coatings in gas turbine blades have been investigated using a scanning Auger microprobe (SAM) analysis and small punch (SP) testing technique. Coating degradation was found to strongly depend on the location of blades operated for 21000h under liquefied natural gas. SAM analyses revealed extensive formation of AlN and Ni enriched in inner (concave) coatings but not in outer (convex) ones. The oxidation and carbonization also occurred more substantially in near surface regions of the inner coating. SP specimens were prepared from the inner and outer coatings in order that the specimen surface could be located near surface or interface coatings. SP tests demonstrated that the oxidation and nitridation in the inner coating produce significant mechanical degradation. Brittle cracking in the inner coating occurred at low strains (&lt;3%) up to 950&#176;C though near interface coatings showed a little higher ductility. The outer coatings near the surface and interface showed higher RT ductility (&gt;6%) than the substrate and a rapid increase in the ductility above 800&#176;C. The coating degradation mechanism is discussed in light of the distribution of operating temperatures.

DIFFUSION AND OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF ELECTRODEPOSITED NI-AL PARTICLE COMPOSITE COATINGS: </B> <I>D.F. Susan</I>, K. Barmak, A.R. Marder, Lehigh University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, Bethlehem, PA 18015<P>
The high temperature diffusion and oxidation behavior of electro-deposited Ni matrix/Al particle coatings was studied to determine the relationships between coating microstructure and high temperature behavior. The coatings, containing up to approximately 20 vol. % Al particles, were deposited on nickel substrates and heat treated at 635, 800, and 1000&#176;C for up to 100 hours. Upon heat treatment at 635 and 800&#176;C, a two phase structure of Ni3Al (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1) and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> solid solution develops with small Kirkendall voids also present. At 1000&#176;C, the coating contains only a solid solution in agreement with the Ni-Al phase diagram. The microhardness of the coating was found to increase with increasing Nail content. Both as-plated and heat treated coatings were oxidation tested in air at 800, 900, and 1000&#176;C for up to 900 hours. Results indicate that the Al content is sufficient to form a protective Al2O3 scale on the coatings during isothermal exposure at these temperatures.

HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION BEHAVIOR OF NIOBIUM ALUMINIDE INTERMETALLICS WITH MOLYBDENUM SILICIDE AND NICKEL ALUMINIDE PROTECTIVE COATINGS: </B> <I>Y. Li</I>, W.O. Soboyejo, R.A. Rapp, Ohio State University, Department of Material Science and Engineering, Columbus, OH 43210<P>
Niobium aluminide intermetallics can exhibit attractive combination of high-temperature strength retention and room-temperature ductility/damage tolerance. Preliminary studies have also shown that niobium aluminides have moderate oxidation resistance at temperatures up to ~750&#176;C in the uncoated condition. However, their oxidation kinetics are not fully understood. In this study, the high-temperature oxidation resistance of niobium aluminide intermetallics (Nb-15Al-10Ti, Nb-15Al-25Ti, Nb-15Al-40Ti and Nv-12.5Al-41Ti-1.5Mo) was studied using uncoated and coated alloys. Protective coatings were formed via in-situ chemical reactions designed to promote the siliciding an aluminizing of Mo and Ni substrate layers, respectively. The isothermal and cyclic oxidation behavior of coated and uncoated materials in air were then studied in the temperature range between 650 and 850&#176;C. The oxide scales and internal layers were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The implications of the results are assessed for potential high-temperature applications of niobium aluminide intermetallics.

ELECTRO-SPARK ALLOYED HEAT RESISTANT COATINGS ON THE WC-CO BASE: </B> <I>A.D. Verkhoturov</I>, S.V. Nikolenko, N.V. Lebukhova, Institute of Materials of Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Electro-spark alloying of the metallic surfaces is one of the most perspective coating technologies, among the many other current coating processes. The main advantages of this method include the possibility of depositing any current conducting materials on the surface; high adhesive strength of the layer, and the simplicity of the process. Electro-spark coatings usually have a relatively low continuity of 60-90%; defects (pores, microfractures), heterophase structure. In spite of that, it is possible to achieve, by using refractory alloys as electrodes, a stable effect of increasing heat-resistance. The research conducted by the Institute of Material Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Khabarovsk, Russia) showed that electrode materials which examine increasing heat-resistance, can be put in the following order (based on the main component): boride-carbide-nitride. The highest hardness (20-24 GPa) and wear resistance among coatings on steel, is achieved with a hard alloy with tungsten carbide-cobalt base (WC-92%, Co-8%). For increasing Wc-Co alloy electro-spark coatings', deposited on the parts working in high temperature and wear conditions, resistance to high-temperature oxidizing, we propose including self-fluxing materials or heat-resistant intermetallics in the alloy. The research in new materials, that include additives of Ni-Cr-B-Si and Ni3Al (0, 5-25%) to the Wc-Co alloy, was also conducted. We have studied the characteristics of macro- and microstructure of materials and coatings, as well as their chemical compositions, electrode material transfer kinetics, and the optimal conditions of alloying the surfaces. Kinetics of high-temperature oxidizing and phase composition of the interaction products, were examined using a differential thermal analysis in non-isothermal conditions method.

LIFE PREDICTION BASED ON CRACK GROWTH BEHAVIOR FOR GAS TURBINE NOZZLES:</B><I> N. Isobe</I>, S. Sakurai Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Japan; K. Kumada, Hitachi Works, Hitachi Ltd., Japan
<P>
Life prediction method for gas turbine nozzles was discussed. In gas turbine nozzles, crackings due to cyclic thermal strain generating with start-up and shut-down of turbines limit the life of components. This thermal strain is usually compression and holded during steady operation time. Therefore, it will be necessary to consider the effect of compressive creep or relaxation to the evaluation of crack growth behavior in nozzles. We conducted crack growth tests at 900&#176;C using a strain wave form including compressive strain hold. Test results showed that crack growth rate in compressive strain hold tests were faster than that in no strain hold tests. A fracture mechanics approach was carried out to evaluate this compression hold effects. By using creep J-integral, a good correlation for crack growth data was obtained. A crack growth analysis considering stress gradient in the component was also carried out and we discussed about its accuracy using inspection data for 25MW class gas turbine nozzles.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION DAMAGE USING ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES: </B><I>D.C. Tamboli</I>, A.K. Rawat, V. Desai, Mechanical Materials and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816
<P>
Electrochemical techniques have been widely used as life prediction tools in corroding structures and coatings for aqueous corrosion. However, there has not been much attention given to the applicability of these techniques in assessing high temperature oxidation damage. In the high temperature oxidation, the metallic substrate is covered with an oxide film which has semiconducting properties. Electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal vital information about the electronic transport properties of this oxide film by monitoring the response of the system to applied D. C. and A. C. potentials respectively. The protective properties of an oxide are largely dependent on the electronic and ionic transport through the oxide layer. In the ex-situ studies, the oxidized specimens are immersed in a highly reversible redox electrolyte. The parameters such as polarization resistance, open circuit potential changes and the oxide band gap potential obtained using these techniques showed good qualitative corroboration with the observed oxidation damage in the alloys studied.

PREDICTIONS OF MICROSTRUCTURE CHANGES IN COATED TURBINE BLADES DURING SERVICE: </B><I>X. Qiao</I>, J.E. Morral, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-3136
<P>
With DICTRA software, it is possible to predict microstructural changes in coated turbine blades during service. In the present work, this technique is illustrated by calculating the microstructures that will form between a nickel base <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 alloy and MCrALY type <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> alloys. It is shown that a number of different microstructures can form initially, depending on the coating composition. As the average composition of the coating varies during service, the microstructure may change several times. These variations can be illustrated on an &quot;Interdiffusion Microstructure Map.&quot;

EFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE CURVATURE AND ROUGHNESS ON RESIDUAL STRESSES IN OXIDE FILMS:</B> <I>J.K. Wright, </I>R.L. Williamson, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-2218
<P>
Finite element simulations are used to examine residual thermal stresses and strains in protective Al2O3 scales on Fe3Al specimens, both during cooling from oxide formation temperatures and during subsequent thermal cycling. Geometrically, the simulations focus on regions of local curvature, either due to corners or substrate surface roughness. A variety of substrate corner radii and film thicknesses are considered. The effects of substrate material behavior are investigated by not only considering the actual elastic-plastic response of the aluminide substrate, but also the limiting cases of purely elastic and perfectly plastic material behavior. When plasticity is permitted, the substrate is able to deform to accommodate stresses at the corner, and the film is in tension along the outside surface and compression near the interface. These tensile stresses are of concern for coating integrity, since corners are observed experimentally to be sites of oxide cracks and spallation.

<P>
Weld repair of ASTM A-470 class 8 high pressure steam turbine rotor steel has been performed to extend the service life of older fossil units. Multipass SAW, MIG and TIG welding have been employed. Microhardness of the base metal was VHN 253, however it dropped to VHN 227 at the heat affected zone close to unaffected base metal for SAW. This area of hardness drop is called &quot;softening zone&quot; and has a width of 0.5~0.6mm. During creep rupture test, failure occurred around the softening zone and rupture time was 772.4hr at 19ksi and 593&#176;C. At ruptured area, spherical types of coarsened carbides, which were revealed molybdenum rich M6C were observed. Based on creep rupture life, SAW and/or high heat input TIG process provide the best creep rupture life and it could operate about 8-10 years.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF ELECTRON BEAM EVAPORATION: </B><I>Adam Powell</I>, Gerardo Trapaga, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; Paul Minson, Intel Corporation, Rio Rancho, NM 87114
<P>
Mathematical models of vapor and melt pool transport phenomena in electron beam evaporation are used to design an optimal beam scanning pattern to achieve a desired evaporant flux distribution at the substrate. The vapor transport model uses the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to calculate evaporant flux distribution at the substrate from the temperature distribution at the source, the activities of source species, background gases and system geometry. The source temperature distribution is adjusted manually in order to produce the desired flux distribution at the substrate. The melt pool model then calculates the heat flux distribution which the scanning electron beam must impart to the molten source surface in order to produce the desired temperature distribution, accounting for thermal losses to radiation and evaporation. Finally, a surface heat transfer model is used to calculate minimum beam local heating by the scanning beam.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NCMS LEAD-FREE SOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: </B><I> Jerald Rosser</I>, Hughes Aircraft Company, P.O.Box 11337, Building 801/E-24, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337
<P>
Since 1990, proposed legislation and consumption taxes on the use of lead have concerned the electronics industry in this country. Although the consumption of lead for electronic interconnections (via solder) is relatively low in comparison to batteries, the possibility of restricting lead usage for solder alloys would have a dramatic effect on the electronics industry. This concern lead the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS), a not-for-profit cooperative research consortium of more than 215 U.S. North American manufacturers, to establish a multi-year Lead Free Solder Project, involving participants from industry, (GM DELCO, AT&amp;T/Lucent Technologies, United Technologies/Hamilton Standard, GM-Hughes, Rockwell International, Ford, Texas Instruments), academia (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and national laboratories (Sandia, NIST, and Electronic Manufacturing Productivity Facility). The objective of the program was to identify lead free solder alternative replacement(s) for lead bearing solders in the electronics industries. The alloy(s) must meet the interconnect performance requirements at operating environments ranging from -40 to +125&#176;C. Over the past three years, numerous lead free alloy solders have been thoroughly evaluated. The project participants will be presenting the results of this four year NCMS evaluation of the material properties, economic impact, toxicological properties, manufacturability, modeling and reliability predictions.

<P>
In this presentation, the process of alloy development and down selection is summarized. An initial list of more than 70 alloys was constructed, including binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys. he first selection process was applied based on the toxicology, economic, and availability criteria. Then a downselection criteria matrix, including melting temperatures, wetting behavior, and thermo-mechanical fatigue, was generated for a quantitative comparison of alloys with respect to three baseline alloys: eutectic Sn-Pb, Sn-Bi, and Sn-Ag solders. Physical testing was performed to provide the data for downselection. Extensive phase diagrams from literature and thermodynamic calculation were used to predict the melting temperature range, and compare with experimental results. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify publications of the past 25 years.

Based on data from the U.S. Department of Interior, an economics/availability study was completed which estimates the impacts on supply and cost to the electronics industry if it were to replace tin-lead solder with a lead-free solder alloy. Considerations in this study included the availability of the replacement materials, world mine production and consumption, world reserves and reserve bases, present world mine production capacity, principal reserve locations, average annual price and price history. Seven alloying elements were investigated. They were antimony, bismuth, cadmium, copper, indium, silver, tin, and zinc. Limits placed on the estimated alloy cost, ore reserve consumption rate, and required mine or refining capacity permitted rank ordering of potential alloys. An extensive literature search on the toxicity of common solder alloying elements was also conducted. Available data on the disposition, toxicity, and exposure limits of these solder alloying elements were analyzed in order to rank their use risk. The process used to evaluate the economics, availability, and toxicity of lead free solders, as well as the findings of the study will be discussed.

<P>MANUFACTURING WITH LEAD-FREE SOLDERS:</B> <I>John Greaves</I>, Electronics Manufacturing Productivity Facility, 714 N. Senate Ave., Indianapolis, IN 46202-3112
<P> 
Successful introduction of lead-free solders into the manufacturing process requires subtle changes in process parameters. Changes in density, melting temperature, wetting and spreading behavior, all affect the parameters necessary for optimum manufacturing and reliability. This currently results in a need to change print speeds, squeegee pressures, and stencil thicknesses. Component placement is relatively unchanged. The largest changes in manufacturing with lead-free solders are those in the reflow process. Manufacturing lead-free solders with RMA fluxes requires modifying reflow profiles to insure that the flux is active when the solder reaches the melting temperature. Manufacturing with fluxes designed for lead-free solders simply requires setting the conveyor speeds and zone temperatures to achieve the suggested profile. No substantial difference has been noticed in the cleaning of lead-free alloys and the lead-free alloys evaluated are compatible with no-clean processes as well. Wave soldering of lead-free solders using RMA fluxes can present some difficulties if the process is not well controlled. While many lead-free solders can be used in wave-soldering with no changes to the profile or pot temperature, using fluxes and profiles designed for lead-free solders can increase yields and simplify the wave-soldering process.

<P>
The reliability of several Lead-free solder alloys are compared. Thermal cycle testing was performed using two different profiles: 0 to +100&#176;C, to simulate telecommunications and office environments; and -55 to +125&#176;C, to simulate automotive and military environments. The National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) Surface Mount Reliability Test Vehicle(SMRTV) was used to test more than 2000 joints/board with more than 10,000 joints per alloy for each temperature cycle. Five Pb-free alloys are compared to 3 baseline alloys, SnPb Eutectic, SnAg Eutectic, and SnBi Eutectic. Three parameter Wiebull analysis is used to determine failure free time, Wiebull life, and Wiebull shape parameter.

<P>RELIABILITY MODELING FOR LEAD-FREE MICROELECTRONICS:</B> <I>Scott A. Schroeder</I>, Rockwell International Science Center, 1049 Camino Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360
<P>
The NCMS Lead-Free Project Modeling Task Group was formed to determine the capability of existing models developed by the consortium members to predict low cycle fatigue life for specified test vehicles using down-selected lead-free solder alloys. A quantitative summary and objective analysis of predictions and modeling capability for down-selected alloys are generated. Life prediction results are correlated with reliability test vehicle data using a -55 to +125&#176;C thermal cycle. The final project goal is a design guide for predicting joint fatigue life for lead-free leadless capacitors and resisters, 44 LCCC, 32 TSOP, and 132 PQFP components. Solder down-selection guidance is provided through recommendations of mechanical tests, test priority, and evaluation of hysteresis loop, thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep, and tensile property data. Alloy phase diagram modeling information provides manufacturing down-selection criteria. Additional support is provided through stress analysis of manufacturing test vehicles.

FILLET-LIFTING IN PLATED-THROUGH-HOLE EOMETRICS:</B> <I>Carol Handwerker</I>, Ursula Kattner, Bill Boettinger, NIST, 223/A153, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; Chris Bailey, University of Greenwich, Wellington Street, Woolwich, London SE18 6PF
<P>
Separation of the solder fillet from the circuit board pad along the solder-intermetallic interface has been observed for a wide range of lead-free solder alloys. The tendency for such separation depends on a number of factors, including solder composition, the freezing range (also known as the pasty range), the mechanical properties of the solder, and the interfacial toughness. The processes leading to fillet-lifting will be described and the potential for eliminating this problem in lead-free alloys will be discussed.

<P> <P>A summary of the completed 4 year study of lead free solder alloys will be presented. In addition to toxicological considerations it was critical to define and agree on the factors and the methodology used in the down selection of 79 alloys to 7 promising alloys. It was necessary to conduct a manufacturing evaluation of compatible surface finishes and generate manufacturing process parameters necessary to assemble test hardware. The results of the extensive reliability evaluations and the modeling of the final down selected alloys will be presented. Follow-on NCMS material interconnect projects will be discussed.

<P>HIGH TEMPERATURE FATIGUE RESISTANT SOLDER - A NCMS PROJECT:</B> <I>Duane Napp</I>, NCMS, 3025 Boardwalk, Ann Arbor, MI 48108-3266
<P> <P>To address the critical issue of placing electronic assemblies in extreme temperature environments that exceed the operating temperatures of commonly used eutectic Sn-Pb solder or high-Pb content alloys, National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) initiated a national consortium in 1996 titled &quot;High Temperature Fatigue Resistant Solder Project&quot;. The project objective is to demonstrate and deploy the technology to substantially improve the performance of solder joints at elevated temperatures under thermal cycling conditions. Two types of solder are to be developed: one with a performance objective of up to 160C, &quot;Alloy 160&quot;, for organic substrate; and a second alloy with a performance objective of 205C, &quot;Alloy 205&quot;, for ceramic substrate, copper die bonding substrates, and hybrid technology. The goal is to demonstrate a thermal fatigue resistance that, in the respective temperature ranges, is equal to or better than that of conventional solders. The need for these new alloys is being driven by the automotive, telecommunications, avionics, and military industries. The project is organized into four task groups with five phases of work, and extends over a period of 33 months. The participants include automotive and military companies, solder suppliers, academic institutions, and national laboratories.

<P>MICROSTRUCTURE AND PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN THE Ag-Cu-Sn TERNARY SYSTEM</B>: <I>M.R. Notis</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh, University, 5 East Packer Ave., Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
<P>The Ag-Cu-Sn system is of interest for use in Pb-free solder alloys, brazing alloys, and in alloys for dental applications. The nature of the invariant reactions in the Sn-rich corner remain in question, and little is known about the effect of Cu addition on the width of the Ag3Sn phase field and its adjoining two- and three-phase fields at lower temperatures. A series of alloys were prepared and studied by metallography and by thermal analysis in order to elucidate these aspects of the Ag-Cu-Sn system.

<P>TAPE AUTOMATED BONDING (TAB) TECHNOLOGY FOR CHIP INTERCONNECTIONS:</B> <I>Sung K. Kang</I>, IBM T.J.Watson Research Center, P.O.Box 218, Rm 37-250, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598
<P>
<P>Tape automated bonding (TAB) technology has been widely used in low-cost consumer products as well as in high-performance multichip modules. TAB technology facilitates the chip-on-board (COB) assembly scheme in most applications. In this talk, two key issues of TAB technology, wafer bumping and inner lead bonding, are reviewed in conjunction with COB applications. Bumping refers to the process of adding raised metal contacts to bond pads in order to provide both the necessary bonding metallurgy for chip-to-lead bonding and a physical standoff to prevent lead-chip shorting. This is done on a wafer or on a TAB tape. Various bumping processes in use are discussed in terms of bump materials/processing, structure, geometry, bump properties and behavior during bonding.

 <I>Y.G.Wang</I>, X.W.Zhou, R.A.Johnson, H.N.G.Wadley, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
<P>A new Monte Carlo procedure for atomistically simulating physical vapor deposition processes is developed and used to model the two-dimensional physical vapor deposition of the step coverage of copper. The method consists of an implant approximation for the initial adatom adsorption on a surface and a multipath diffusion analysis to simulate subsequent surface morphology and interior atomic structure evolution. An embedded atom method is used to determine the activation energies for each of the many available diffusion paths. The method has been used to predict the morphology/structure evolution of copper films over the length and time scales encountered in practical deposition processes. The modeling approach has enabled determination of the effect of vapor processing variables such as flux orientation, deposition rate, substrate temperature, kinetic energy and aspect ratio on deposit morphology/microstructure and step coverage behavior.

<P>PEEL STRENGTH IN A Cu/Cr POLYIMIDE SYSTEM:</B> <I> I. S. Park, </I>Jun Yu, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, KAIST, P.O. Box 201, Cheongryang, Seoul, 130-650, Korea
<P>
<P>The adhesion strength of a metal film on a substrate is usually measured by the Peel Test. This test is not a direct measure of the interfacial energy because of the severe plastic deformation of the metal film accompanying the test. In the present analysis, using the Cu/Cr/polyimide system, the surface energy was deduced from the peel strength measurements and corresponding elasto-plastic analysis of the peel test. The metal/polyimide interface energy was varied by changing the pretreatment condition of the polyimide surface in Ar(+) RF plasma, and the adhered film thickness and yield stress were varied by changing the electroplating conditions. After the peel test, the chemistry of the Cr/polyimide interfaces were studied by AES and XPS.X-ray measurements of the residual strain in the peeled films were very useful in estimating the plastic work expenditure accompanying peeling. Results indicate that the deduced interfacial fracture energy is usually much smaller than the peel strength and is influenced by the RF pretreatment, but the interfacial energy is independent of the mechanical properties of the metal film, as expected.

<P>CALCULATIONS OF RADIATION EFFECTS ON 316 STAINLESS STEEL CONTAINER MATERIALS FOR THE NSNS:</B> <I>M.S. Wechsler</I>1, M.H. Barnett1, L.K. Mansur2, J.M. Barnes2, L.A. Charlton2, J.O.

<P>
<P>A current pre-conceptual design for the National Spallation Neutron Source (NSNS) considers the target to be flowing liquid mercury contained within a double-walled 316 stainless steel vessel. Calculations are underway to determine the neutron flux and to estimate the rates at which displacements, helium, and hydrogen are produced. The primary computational tools are MCNP, SPECTER, HETC, and LAHET. The displacement and helium production rates range up to about 10-7 DPA/s and 10-6 appm He/s due to the spectrum of neutrons produced by a 1700 MeV proton beam. The variation of calculated damage rates throughout the target region of NSNS is described and discussed.

<P>HELIUM PRODUCTION RATES ARISING FROM SPALLATION NEUTRONS IN THE LANSCE RADIATION EFFECTS FACILITY:</B> <I>F.A. Garner</I>1, W. F. Sommer2, P. D. Ferguson2, M. S. Wechsler3, M.H. Barnett3, B.M.

<P>
<P>Foils of pure Cu, Co, Fe and Ni were irradiated in the second inboard tube of the rabbit system adjacent to the beam stop of the LANSCE facility. After irradiation, the foils were cut in half to determine neutron fluence and spectra via measurement of gamma activation, and to measure helium generation via isotopic dilution mass spectroscopy. The measured helium concentrations were 0.110, 0.152, 0.122 and 0.097 appm for Fe, Ni, Cu, and Co, respectively. The dpa level calculated for copper was 0.011 dpa, yielding a value of 11.1 appm/dpa. Comparisons with improved calculations of neutron flux/spectra and helium and displacement production rates are in progress to characterize the neutron environment of the rabbit system and to assess its radiation damage effects.

<P>THE EFFECT OF THE NEW NUCLEON-NUCLEUS ELASTIC SCATTERING MODEL IN LAHET VERSION 2.8 ON DAMAGE CROSS SECTION CALCULATIONS:</B> <I>E.J. Pitcher</I>1, P.D. Ferguson1, G.J. Russell1, J.D. Court1, L.L.

<P>
<P>The latest release of the medium-energy Monte Carlo transport code LAHET includes a new nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering treatment based on an interim global medium-energy phenomenological optical-model potential. Implementation of the model in LAHET allows nuclear elastic scattering for neutrons with energies greater than 15 MeV and for protons with energies greater than 50 MeV. Previous investigations on the impact of the new elastic scattering model revealed that the addition of the proton elastic scattering channel can lead to a significant increase in the calculated damage energy. We report here results of further investigations on the impact of the new elastic scattering model on calculated damage cross sections and recoil spectra for materials and particle energies prototypic of spallation target environments. With the new elastic scattering treatment, the damage cross section for 20-MeV neutrons on light nuclei (A &lt; 30) as calculated by LAHET is in much better agreement with SPECTER calculations, where significant discrepancies have previously been observed.

<P>THE INFLUENCE OF SUBCASCADE FORMATION ON DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE AT HIGH PKA ENERGIES:</B> <I>R.E. Stoller</I>, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6376
<P>
<P>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of displacement cascades have been extended to energies as high as 40 keV. These simulations are the highest energy cascades completed to date and they provide valuable insight on the formation of primary damage in irradiated materials. An MD simulation at 40 keV is equivalent to a PKA energy of 61 keV, which is the average PKA energy from a neutron with an energy of 1.8 MeV. Although peak neutron energies in a spallation neutron source will be much higher than 1.8 MeV, the degree of subcascade formation observed at MD energies above 20 keV suggests that little change in the primary damage state will be observed for higher energies. This implies that fission reactor data should provide a good simulation of the displacement damage observed in a spallation neutron source. Thus, the effect of transmutation products is likely to be the most important difference between the two irradiation environments.

<P>INVESTIGATION OF HIGH-ENERGY-PROTON EFFECTS IN ALUMINUM: </B> <I>C.J. Czajkowski</I>, C.L. Snead, M. Todosow, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000
<P>
<P>Specimens of 1100 aluminum were exposed to several fluences of 23.5-GeV protons at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. Although this energy is above those currently being proposed for spallation neutron applications, the results can be viewed as indicative of trends and other microstructural evolution with fluence that take place with high-energy proton exposures such as those associated with an increasing ratio of gas generation to dpa. TEM investigation showed significantly larger bubble size and lower density of bubbles compared with lower-energy proton results. Estimates of H and He gas generation made using Monte Carlo are also used in this comparison. Additional testing showed that the tensile strength increased with fluence as expected, but the microhardness decreased, a result for which an interpretation is still under investigation.

<P>RESPONSE OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS TO RADIATION ENVIRONMENTS:</B> C.J. Czajkowski, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000
<P>
<P>An evaluation of proton and neutron damage to various materials has been performed. The proton studies were conducted at energies of 0.2, 0.8, and 23.5 GeV and consisted of evaluation of proton-irradiated window/target materials from accelerators. The materials evaluated for the proton irradiations included high-purity (6 9's), 1100, and 5052 aluminum, 304 stainless steel, and inconel 718. The neutron damage research centered on 6061 T-6 aluminum from a control rod follower from the BNL HFBR, which received thermal fluence up to ~4 x 1023 n/cm2. The effects of thermal-to-fast neutron flux ratios are discussed. The increases in tensile strength in the proton-irradiated materials are shown to be due to atomic displacements, resulting in radiation hardening. Production of helium in the grain boundaries of proton-irradiated 6 9's aluminum is also discussed. The major factor contributing to the mechanical-property changes in the neutron-irradiated 6061 aluminum is transmutation products formed by interactions with thermal neutrons.

<P>
Niobium superconducting rf cavities are proposed for use in the proton LINAC for spallation neutron applications. Because of accidental beam loss and continual halo losses along the acceleration path, the concern of the degradation of the superconducting properties with accumulated irradiation arises. Residual-resistivity-ratio (RRR) specimens of Nb, with a range of initial RRR's, were irradiated at room temperature at energies from 200 MeV to 2000 MeV. Four-probe resistance measurements were made at room temperature and at 4.2 K both prior and after irradiations. Proton fluences ranged from 5 x 1014 to about 5 x 1016 p/cm2. These room-temperature results simulate the resistance changes to be expected in LINAC operation for the cavities having been exposed to the radiation and then cycled through an anneal to room temperature. The defect structures produced have been characterized using both scanning and transmission microscopy. Implications of the results to proposed cavity operation and recent results on cavity irradiations will be presented.

Radiation damage is considered to be the most critical load for the lifetime of components in or close to the proton beam penetrating the target of high power spallation sources. Specimens irradiated in operating medium-power spallation devices are at present the only source of <B>direct </B> information on the behavior of materials in a spallation environment. Within an international cooperation, the following specimens will be investigated in the hot cells at KFA J&uuml;lich: (1) A hemispherical LAMPF window made of INCONEL 718, (2) A spherical LAMPF water degrader made of INCONEL 718 and 316 SS, (3) Two curved PSI windows made of DIN 1.4926 SS and irradiated in LAMPF, and (4) A complete target from ISIS consisting of Ta plates in a 304 SS housing. After cutting and preparation of different types of miniaturized specimens the following tests will be performed: 3 point bending tests, ball punch tests, microhardness measurements, scanning (and possibly transmission) electron microscopy, and tensile tests (only for ISIS specimens where ample material is available). First results for specimens obtained from (1) and (2) will be reported.

SIMULATION IRRADIATIONS OF TARGET AND STRUCTURE COMPONENTS FOR SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCES:</B> <I>E. Camus</I>, N. Wanderka, H. Wollenberger, Hahn-Meitner-Institut, D-14109 Berlin, Germany<P>
Beside damage levels up to 10 dpa per month, the spallation reaction induces high levels of transmutation products, mainly hydrogen (up to 0.5 at.% per month) and helium (up to 0.1 at.% per month). Dual-beam irradiations with heavy ions, protons, and/or helium ions with energies up to 300 keV make it possible to introduce such damage levels and high hydrogen or helium contents within hours. We present experimental results on the microstructure evolution and on mechanical properties of simulation irradiated steels and tantalum. The cavity microstructure is investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Field-ion microscopy with atom probe (FIM-AP) shows fine scale radiation-induced segregation. Hardness measurements on specimens implanted at low temperature with heavy ions, protons, and/or helium have been performed and reveal a drastic increase of hardness. Both the displacement rate and the hydrogen or helium implantation rate used in simulation irradiations are orders of magnitude higher than those produced in spallation environments. Data correlation, with special emphasis on the influence of the hydrogen or helium implantation rate, is discussed.

TRIPLE ION-BEAM STUDIES OF RADIATION DAMAGE EFFECTS IN A HIGH POWER SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE ENVIRONMENT:</B> L.K. Mansur, K. Farrell, <I>E.H. Lee</I>, G.R. Rao, J.D. Hunn, P.M. Rice, M.B. Lewis, S.W. Cook, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6376<P>
The unique Triple Ion-Beam Facility (TIF) at ORNL allows researchers to mimic significant features of the NSNS irradiation environment by producing displacement damage and injecting He and H simultaneously. In this work, therefore, austenitic EC316LN and ferritic 9Cr2WVTa alloys were irradiated using the TIF to investigate radiation damage effects. Irradiations were carried out using 4 MeV Fe++, 400 keV He+, and 200 keV H+ simultaneously to accumulate 50 dpa, 10,000 appm He, and 50,000 appm H, respectively. Irradiations were carried out at temperatures from 50 to 200&#176;C. The specific ion energies were chosen to maximize the damage and the gas accumulation at the same depth of ~1 &#181;m. Microstructure and surface hardness of irradiated specimens were evaluated by TEM and the Nanoindenter, respectively. This report summarizes damage microstructure as a function of irradiation depth from cross-sectioned TEM specimens and hardness variation of the bombarded surfaces.

IRRADIATION DAMAGE OF FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS: FUSION PROGRAM DATA APPLIED TO THE SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE APPLICATION:</B> R.L. Klueh, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6376<P>
Ferritic/martensitic steels in the target structure of a spallation neutron source will experience many of the extreme conditions expected in a fusion power plant (i.e., high-energy neutrons that produce large amounts of displacement damage and transmutation helium). Thus, studies of the steels for fusion are relevant for the spallation neutron source application. The ferritic/martensitic steels are candidates for fusion because of superior swelling resistance, better liquid-metal compatibility, higher thermal conductivity, and lower thermal expansion than austenitic steels. The major problem with ferritic/martensitic steels involves the effect of irradiation on fracture, as determined by a Charpy impact test. Fast reactor irradiation produces an increase in the ductile-brittle transition temperature and decrease in the upper-shelf energy. The effect saturates with fluence for fast-reactor irradiation, but the saturation values observed for irradiation in a fast reactor do not apply for irradiation in a mixed-spectrum reactor under conditions where transmutation helium is generated simultaneously with displacement damage. This helium effect is one of the critical issues that needs to be understood, since high helium concentrations will be generated in conjunction with the displacement damage in a fusion reactorand in the target of a spallation neutron source, should a ferritic/martensitic steel be chosen for that application.

ACTIVATION OF MATERIALS PROPOSED FOR USE IN SUPERCONDUCTING LINAC APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>A. Hanson</I>, C.L. Snead, G.A. Greene, C.J. Czajkowski, K.C. Chan, H.

Linacs are proposed for spallation neutron sources which are capable of relatively high beam currents. Associated with the transport of these high currents will be relatively high beam losses to the linac structures from the beam halo and occasional mis-steering. A series of irradiations have been conducted at the Saturne, France, accelerator in which specimens of steel, copper, NbTi, aluminum, and niobium were exposed to protons with energies from 400 to 2000 MeV. Gamma activation measurements were made for various times subsequent to the end of the beam. Absolute and relative activity levels have been achieved on which estimates of the exposure levels to maintenance personnel can be made. Particular attention was given to Nb because of its prominence in scenarios that call for superconducting rf-cavity linacs. For Nb the activation products for the various irradiations were determined and compared with code predictions.

LIQUID METAL COMPATIBILITY OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS WITH LIQUID LEAD-BISMUTH AND MERCURY: </B> J.R. Weeks, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000
<P>
Both liquid mercury and liquid lead-bismuth eutectic have been proposed as possible target materials for spallation neutron sources. During the 1950's and 1960's a substantial program existed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of the Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor program on the compatibility of bismuth, lead, and their alloys with structural materials. Subsequently, compatibility investigations of mercury with structural materials were performed in support of the development of Rankine-cycle mercury turbines for nuclear applications. The present talk will review our understanding of the corrosion/mass-transfer reactions of structural materials with these liquid-metal coolants. Topics to be discussed include the basic solubility relationships of iron, chromium, nickel, and refractory metals in these liquid metals, the results of inhibition studies, the role of oxygen on the corrosion processes, and specialized topics such as cavitation corrosion and liquid-metal embrittlement. Emphasis will be placed on utilizing the understanding gained in this earlier work in the development of heavy-liquid-metal targets for spallation neutron sources.

MODELING AND OPTICAL STUDIES OF THE WATER-METAL INTERFACE IN SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE TARGETS: </B><I>L.L. Daemen</I>, G.J. Kanner, R.S. Lillard, D.P. Butt, T.O. Brun, W.F. Sommer, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
In spallation neutron sources neutrons are produced when a beam of high-energy particles (e.g., 1 GeV protons) collides with a (water-cooled) heavy metal target such as tungsten. The resulting spallation reactions produce a complex radiation environment (which differs from typical conditions at fission and fusion reactors) leading to the radiolysis of water molecules. Most water radiolysis products are short-lived but extremely reactive. When formed in the vicinity of the target surface they can react with metal atoms, thereby contributing to target corrosion. We will describe the results of calculations and experiments performed at Los Alamos to determine the impact on target corrosion of water radiolysis in the spallation radiation environment. Our computational methodology relies on the use of the Los Alamos radiation transport code, LAHET, to determine the radiation environment, and the AEA code, FACSIMILE, to model reaction-diffusion processes. The experiments make use of ultra-fast Raman spectroscopic techniques. Laser Raman spectroscopy enables us to identify the chemical species formed in water and at a metal surface during irradiation, as well as to observe the growth of corrosion products at the water-metal interface.

<I>IN SITU </I>STUDIES OF AQUEOUS CORROSION OF TARGET AND STRUCTURAL MATERIALS IN WATER IRRADIATED BY AN 800 MEV PROTON BEAM: </B><I>D.P. Butt</I>, G.S. Kanner, L.L. Daemen, R.S. Lillard, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Radiation enhanced, aqueous corrosion of solid spallation-neutron-source targets, such as tungsten, or target cladding or structural materials, such as superalloys and stainless steels, is a significant concern in accelerator-driven transmutation technologies. In this paper we describe methods for control and <I>in situ </I>monitoring of corrosion in accelerator cooling water loops. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have measured the corrosion rates of aluminum 6061, copper, Inconel 718, and 304L stainless steel in the flow loop of a water target irradiated by a milliamp, 800 MeV proton beam. We also briefly describe our second generation experiments, scheduled to begin in early 1997. In these experiments we will measure the corrosion rates of tungsten, tantalum, Inconel 718, aluminum 5053, and 316L, 304L, and HT-9 stainless steel. We also discuss our laser diagnostic techniques for directly observing the production of corrosive radiolysis products as well as corrosion products near the surface of target materials.

STATIC CORROSION OF MARTENSITE/FERRITE AND AUSTENITIC STEELS IN MERCURY AT 300&#176;C:</B> <I>Y. Dai</I>, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland
<P>
Mercury corrosion will be one of the critical problems for a spallation neutron source using Hg as target material. Preliminary results of static corrosion tests on 316L austenitic steel and on MANET and F82H martensitic/ferritic steels will be presented. Smooth and notched C-ring-shaped specimens were prestressed before putting them into Hg. The tests were performed at 300C and interrupted after different durations. After cooling down to room temperature, the change of morphology of specimen surfaces was examined. For 316L specimens after 160 hrs of corrosion, Hg covered all surfaces. However, for F82H and MANET, there was almost no Hg on surfaces after 500 hrs, but surfaces were covered with Hg after an additional 500 hrs. F82H had the thickest oxide layer (about 0.5 &#181;m thick after 1000 hours), MANET was next, and 316L had the thinnest oxide layer. The mechanisms for wetting and oxidation will be discussed.

SURFACE OXIDES AND THE BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM COMPONENTS IN THE APT TARGET/BLANKET SYSTEM:</B> <I>M.R. Louthan, Jr</I>., Savannah River Technology Center, Aiken, SC 29808
<P>
The mechanical properties of the aluminum alloys in the accelerator production of tritium (APT) target/blanket system are sensitive to exposure and processing history. Several of the APT applications require exposure to flowing, hot water under heat transfer conditions. The thermal conductivity of the protective film is low and limits the temperature drop across the aluminum. This reduction in heat transfer will raise metal-oxide interface temperature and play a major role in the corrosion processes. Under heat transfer conditions, the oxide-metal interface temperature will increase both oxide thicknesses and service temperatures for aluminum. Interrelationships among service, oxide development and water chemistry are similar to those for reactor service and this paper relates anticipated performance in the APT system to reactor experience.

PRE-CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PRELIMINARY NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED NATIONAL SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE:</B> <I>J.O. Johnson</I>, J.M. Barnes, L.A. Charlton, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6363
<P>
The Department of Energy has initiated a pre-conceptual design study for the National Spallation Neutron Source (NSNS) and given preliminary approval for the proposed facility to be built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The pre-conceptual design of the NSNS consists of an accelerator system capable of delivering a 1-2 GeV proton beam, with 1 MW of beam power, in an approximate 0.5 microsecond pulse, at a 60 Hz frequency onto a single target station. The NSNS will be upgraded in stages to a 5 MW facility with two target stations (a 60 Hz station and a 10 Hz station). There are many possible layouts and designs for the NSNS target stations. This paper gives a brief overview of the proposed NSNS with respect to the target station, as well as the general philosophy adopted for the neutronic design of the NSNS target stations. A reference design, based upon experience at existing sources and on designs for proposed new, high power, sources is presented, and some of the preliminary design neutronic results for the NSNS are briefly discussed.

CALCULATED NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE AND RADIATION DAMAGE PARAMETERS FOR THE UPGRADED MANUEL LUHAN, JR., NEUTRON SCATTERING CENTER TARGET SYSTEM:</B> <I>P.D. Ferguson</I>, G.J. Russell, E.J. Pitcher, J.D. Court, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
The upgraded MLNSC target system is designed to be a split target with two tiers of moderators. The original suite of moderators serving 12 flight paths has been optimized and an additional pair of moderators, one water and one LH2, have been added in a new upper moderator tier serving 4 additional flight paths. The upper moderators are coupled and viewed in backscattering geometry, as opposed to the decoupled moderators in the existing MLNSC target system which are viewed in transmission. Fabrication of this new target system is currently in progress and installation is expected in 1998. The neutronic performance of the target system s presented in the form of time and energy spectra for each of the planned moderators with comparisons to the existing MLNSC moderators. Results of several studies, including moderator thickness, upper target length, and reflector material, are presented. For the upper and lower targets, target canister material, and moderator structural material, we present neutron and proton energy spectra, helium production, and DPA calculations. Existing accelerator materials damage data are referenced, where applicable, to draw general conclusions on component lifetime.

CALCULATED NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE OF A LONG-PULSE SPALLATION SOURCE:</B> <I>G.J. Russell</I>, E.J. Pitcher, P.D. Ferguson, J.D. Court, D.J. Weinacht, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Neutronic performance studies of a Long-Pulse Spallation Source (LPSS) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory show that a 1-MS LPSS has world-class neutronic performance with low technical risk. An LPSS uses coupled moderators (moderators that communicate neutronically at all energies with an adjacent reflector). There are potential gains of about a factor of 6 in time-averaged neutron brightness for a coupled moderator compared to a decoupled one; however, this gain comes at the expense of putting &quot;tails&quot; on the neutron pulses. The particulars of a neutron pulse from a moderator (e.g., rise time, peak intensity, pulse width as measured by the standard deviation or full-width at half maximum of the pulse, and decay constant(s) of the tails) are crucial parameters for instrument design/performance at an LPSS. Moderator neutronic performance can be altered in a variety of ways: a)target material and geometry; (b) moderator material and geometry; c) target-moderator geometry; d) reflector material; e) presence of decouplers and flight path liners; and f) the proton pulse width. We will discuss the neutronic performance of an LPSS and describe the variety of neutronic optimization studies that have been done to improve the neutronic performance of such a neutron source.

NEUTRONIC DESIGN OF THE APT MATERIALS IRRADIATION AT THE LOS ALAMOS SPALLATION RADIATION EFFECTS FACILITY:</B> <I>P.D. Ferguson</I>1, W.F. Sommer1, M. S. Wechsler2, G.J. Russell1, E.J. Pitcher1, R.B.

<P>
The APT project is in the process of qualifying materials for use in the target/blanket assembly. As part of the process, an eight month irradiation of prospective target, blanket, beam entry window, and structural materials is taking place at LASREF in the 800-MeV, 1 mA proton beam. The irradiation is configured to produce samples at prototypic APT radiation environments, as well as samples at reduced damage rates to provide information as to how the materials age in an APT environment. In addition, three prototype lead blanket modules are being irradiated along with several aluminum tubes filled with 3He to experimentally determine the extent of tritium implantation in the APT system and to explore possible mitigation techniques. In this paper, we detail the methodology of the neutronic design of the irradiation. Neutron and proton spectra are presented for several irradiation locations and materials, as well as calculated gas production and dpa estimates.

PROGRESS REPORT ON THE ACCELERATOR PRODUCTION OF TRITIUM MATERIALS PROGRAM:</B> <I>S.A. Maloy,</I> W.F. Sommer, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Progress will be reported on the status of an irradiation by 800 MeV protons and spallation neutrons to determine the change in mechanical properties of materials to be used in the APT project. Materials will be irradiated for 8-9 months at the Los Alamos Radiation Effects Facility (LASREF). The irradiation matrix, developed by members of several laboratories nationwide, consists of specimens of candidate materials, scaled components and a closed-loop water system to measure rates of corrosion in irradiated water. The objectives are to determine the performance (particularly, mechanical and corrosion properties) of materials in APT-prototypic proton and neutron radiation and temperatures, to test manufacturing processes for producing components, and to develop a surveillance program to monitor the properties of materials during the life of the APT target/blanket.

SULFIDE CAPACITY OF FeO-BASED SLAGS:</B> R.G. Reddy, W. Zhao, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487<P>
Sulfide capacities of FeO-based silicate slags were calculated <I>a priori</I> using the Reddy-Blander model. Experiments were done using encapsulation method for several slag systems as a function of compositions and temperatures. The experimental results agree with the predicted data very well. The predicted sulfide capacity data was used in calculation of the sulfur distribution ratio in the slags and metal.

SULFIDE CAPACITY OF SLAGS:</B> R. Sridhar, S. Simeonov, J.M. Toguri, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5S 3E4<P>
During the experimental studies on sulfide capacities of non-ferrous metallurgical slags it was found that the choice of the thermodynamic data base is important for calculating the sulfur potential in such measurement. It was also found that some of the earlier sulfide capacity measurements required recalculation. The available sulfide capacity for different slag systems were reviewed after recalculations. This analysis suggested high sulfur solubility 
 in halide melts which were confirmed by experiments reported in another paper. The reviewed data on sulfide capacities are presented together with calculations of sulfur partition achievable with different slags.

SULFUR SOLUBILITY IN CaCl2-CaF2 and BaF2-BaCl2 MELTS:</B> S. Simeonov, R. Sridhar, J.M. Toguri, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3E4.
<P>
CaF2 additions are made to oxide based slags used for steel desulfurization to aid in sulfur removal. It is commonly held that CaF2 by itself does not possess sulfur removal capability but enhances fluidity of CaO based slags which helps desulfurization. Recently BaF2 additions to CaO and BaO based slags have been studied to improve their sulfide capacity. To better understand the sulfur removal mechanism, sulfur solubility measurements were carried out on CaCl2-CaF2 and BaCl2-BaF2 melts. Results showed that contrary to earlier expectation they have high sulfur solubility and higher than that for sodium silicate slags which are used for desulfurization. The conventional sulfide capacity definition based on exchange of oxygen and sulfur ions in slag used for defining desulfurization power of slags do not apply to such melts as there are no oxygen ions present and no oxygen ion transfer takes place.

ASPECTS OF SLAG OPTIMIZATION IN SMELTING OF Cu-Ni SULFIDE CONCENTRATES:</B> A.A. Hejja, R.H. Eric, School of Process and Materials Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Private Bag 3, WITS 2050, South Africa<P>
The first part of this study deals with the importance of surface tension of slags produced in the smelting of sulfide concentrates. Theoretically the method of determining the surface tension of slags was laid down by Boni and Derge. The values obtained experimentally for a series of main oxide components were grouped into a useful correlation incorporating experimental constants for the relevant oxides present in the slag, some of these giving the surface tension value for the particular slag. These estimated values were coupled with or incorporated into the slag viscosity plots to show the correlation between the two factors. This is also important from a refractory attack point of view in the furnace operation. In the second part an attempt is made toward the optimization of slag composition relevant both for electric and reverberatory smelting processes. Using the knowledge of the viscosity and electrical conductivity of the slags at the temperature of furnace operation, the mode of optimization is based on Besselt function correlations which utilize the trend of the mostly parabolic plots of viscosities and conductivities. The results obtained by this method agree well with the optimum slag compositions being used in established operations derived from years of practical experience for various slags used in the furnaces. However, due to extensive turbulence in suspension and gas injected bath smelting processes, the outlined methods cannot be used for these processes. Also great caution should be exercised in their application for three electrode circular furnaces with separate slag cleaning.

SOLUBILITY OF BISMUTH AND LEAD IN IRON AND IRON-CARBON ALLOYS: </B> Lewen Chang, Sandeep Malhotra, Mark E. Schlesinger, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla, 1870 Miner Circle, Rolla, MO 65409-0340<P>
The thermodynamic properties of Fe-C-Bi and Fe-C-Pb alloys are of interest for a variety of reasons related to steel production and recycling; however, experimental data on phase equilibria in these systems are scarcer. Experimental procedures will be described for an ongoing research program measuring the activities of Bi and Pb in solid and liquid Fe and Fe-C alloys. Preliminary results will be presented, with the primary goal of using measured solubilities to derive model parameters for calculating bismuth and lead activities as a function of temperature and alloy composition.

The report presents results of thermodynamical investigation of wide range of complex systems, including carbo thermal reduction of silica, silicon carbide obtaining from different precursors, anode processes during molten salts electrolysis, tin atomization in AAS, interaction in copper-, manganese- and sulfur- containing systems. Special attention is paid to thermodynamical approach to investigation and estimation of multi component multi element compositions stability. Environmental topic in the report is presented by discussion of two important issues: (a) problem of radioactive wastes interaction -with environment, and (b) investigation on thermodynamic stability of exhaust from different sources. Also are discussed very important problems of informational support (thermodynamics data accuracy) of complex systems thermodynamics simulation.

OXYSULPHIDE IN METALLURGY OF NICKEL AND COBALT:</B> I.D. Reznik, A.V. Tarasov, T.A. Kharlakova, State Research Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals, Acad. Korolyov Street, 13, Moscow, Russia, 129515; E.N. Selivanov, Institute of Metallurgy of the Ural's Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 101 Amundsen Street, Ekaterinburg, Russia, 620147<P>
On blowing nickel matte in a converter without quarts, first the oxidation of metallic iron and a part of FeS occurs without evolving sulfur dioxide, the formed FeO dissolves in a sulfide smelt and form a homogeneous Oxysulphide smelt. On further increasing the FeO content, the Oxysulphide separates into 2 layers. Based on the laboratory investigation of FeO-(FeS+Feo) - (Ni3S2+Nio) ternary phase we have identified the separation region at 1250&#176;C. The boundaries of the separation region have the form of an arc and the composition of the separated Oxysulphide layers is defined by the canodes. In the nickel or copper-nickel matte - calcium oxidesilica slag system at 1250&#176;C three layers, namely sulfide, Oxysulphide, and slag may be formed. A high slag basicity due to the presence of CaO can serve to enhance the activity of FeO; a low nickel content in the matte corresponds to a high concentration of FeS therein; FeO from slag and FeS from the matte form a homogeneous FeO-FeS solution, i.e. an Oxysulphide layer. The investigation on the &quot;Camebakes&quot; apparatus and by the nuclear gamma-ray resonance spectroscopy method of the phase composition in a slowly cooled Oxysulphide layer has shown the presence of four phases. wustite, troilite, ferronickel grains, and calcium oxide-silica inclusions. Knowledge of regulaties in the oxysulphides formation makes it possible to use them in pyrometallurgy of nickel and cobalt or preventing their formation.

Feedstock powders of metals, alloys and ceramics for thermal spray applications have to meet several specifications. Particle shape, size and distribution, powder flow characteristics and density are the important factors that need to be controlled, in order to ensure high spray efficiency and better coating properties. Thermal plasma technology can be effectively utilized to produce metal, alloy and ceramic powders for spray applications. The present paper describes plasma spheroidisation of commercially available aluminum powder and nickel-aluminum powder blend in a plasma reactor. Results show that the processed powder particles bear spherical morphology with excellent flow characteristics, ideal for thermal spray applications.

NON-ELECTROLYTIC DEPOSITION OF SILVER ON TO TUNGSTEN-POWDER PARTICLES:</B> Jae-Ho Lee, Hong lk University, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, 721 Sangsu dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul 121-791, Korea; G.P. Martins, Colorado School of Mines, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Golden, CO 80401
<P>
For some electronic applications where a dispersed electrically-conductive particulate phase is employed, the conductivity of the surface (or near-surface region) of the particles provides for the primary mechanism which determines its electrical conductivity. Particles of a less expensive material, which may have desirable thermal-expansion properties, when coated with silver offer a means of also obtaining desirable electrical properties at a lower cost. The research conducted was focused primarily on the development of silver-coated tungsten particles for thick-film polymeric conductors. The ammoniacal electrolyte was formulated from silver-nitrate, glycine inhibitor and formaldehyde reductant. The reduction, and subsequent deposition, of silver occurred selectively on the surface of the tungsten particles. Coated particles were assessed by SEM imaging. The thickness of the silver coating was estimated to be approximately 100nm on the basis of a mass account and the coating being uniform. The electrical conductivity of a silver-coated tungsten-powder pellet was found to be similar to that of a silver-powder pellet, of identical geometry.

The determination of the governing step of the deoxidization rate and the effects of the hydrogen content of the mixtures (C), the diameter of the delivery orifice (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alt-sig-phi.gif">) and the Reynolds number of the orifice (Roe) on the product Av keg was investigated. Av is the total surface area of the interface between the bubbles and the melt keg, is the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase. The design of the experiments was based on a two levels statistic fractionated factorial planning Oxygen in the melt was measured as a function of time. In the prevailing experimental conditions it was found that the governing step of the deoxidization rate was the transport of hydrogen in the gaseous phase and that Av kejg increases with C, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alt-sig-phi.gif"> and Reo.

CHEMICAL WEAR OF REFRACTORIES IN THE SLAG LINE OF VOD LADLES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF STAINLESS STEELS:</B> B. Blanpain, P. Wollants, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, K.U. Leuven, de Croylaan 2, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium, and B. Hallemans, ALZ, Genk-Zuid zone 6A, B-3600 Genk, Belgium
<P>
The slag line in vacuum oxygen decarburization (VOD) ladles is a severe environment for refractory materials during the refining of stainless, steels. Magnesia-chrome bricks are currently the refractory materials of choice for this application. The actual performance of a fixed quality of magnesia-chrome bricks is however largely dependent on the conditions during the VOD process cycle. This presentation addresses the aspects of chemical interaction between the slag phase and the magnesia-chrome refractory materials. As-delivered and postmortem bricks have been analyzed by optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Different phenomena were observed such as slag penetration and oxide reduction. These experimental observations are the basis for a modeling of the slag/magnesia-chrome reaction. The aim is to investigate alternate, viable VOD processing routes which are less demanding on the refractory materials<I>.</I>

PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN THE OXIDE-SATURATED Ca-Mg-O SYSTEM</B>: Xiaoping Xu, Mark E. Schlesinger,<I> </I>Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla, 1870 Miner Circle, Rolla, MO 65409-0340
<P>
Recent research results have claimed that previously accepted Gibbs energies of formation of CaO and MgO are in error, and that MgO is actually more stable than CaO at lower temperatures. The potential impact of this on the existing thermodynamic database and on calculations using <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">G0f values for these oxides is considerable. However, the newly calculated values remain controversial. Equilibration of pure CaO and MgO with a metal phase at temperatures between 1100&#176;C and 1200&#176;C allows the new <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">G0f values to be &quot;tested,&quot; using a previously derived thermodynamic model for liquid CaMg alloys to calculate activities in the metal phase. The fit between actual and predicted alloy compositions determines the likelihood that the new thermodynamic values are valid.

REDUCTION OF MnO PELLETS BY CARBON-SATURATED LIQUID IRON:</B> Jose Roberto de Oliveira, Marcelo Breda Mourdo, Paulo dos Santos Assis and Jorge Alberto Soares Tenorio, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, 05508-900, Sao Paulo, Brazil
<P>
The goal of this study was to investigate the reduction of MnO pellets by carbon saturated liquid iron. The effects of the initial Mn and Si content in the bath were explored. The tests were performed in laboratory apparatus, where MnO pellets reacted with a saturated liquid iron bath. The reduction time was taken by measurement of the CO pressure variation with the time. The results showed the effect of initial Mn, C and Si content in the bath. The Kinetics of MnO reduction increases with the decrease in the initial MnO content in the bath. Si in the bath increases the reduction rate of the MnO pellets.

THERMAL PLASMA ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR INFILTRATION:</B> Patrick R. Taylor, Banqiu Wu, Edgar E. Vidal, University of Idaho, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Mining Engineering, Moscow, ID 83844-3024
<P>
A novel method for chemical vapor infiltration, using thermal plasma technology, has been developed. The use of a thermal plasma source may allow much greater infiltration rates than conventional CVI. Precursors that are fed into the flame region of the plasma are vaporized and forced to flow through a porous preform, at a controlled temperature, where condensation or chemical reactions occur. Exploratory experiments, using silica and methane as precursors and graphite felt for the preform, have been performed. The change in the pressure drop across the preform, as infiltration occurred, is compensated by the use of a vacuum pump on the discharge of the reactor. The product was characterized using SEM and x-ray diffraction. A uniform infiltration rate of SiC was observed along the width of the preform.

<P>
The oxychlorination kinetics of pure Cr2O3 with C12+O2 is studied by ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA) in non and isothermal conditions up to 1000C. The final reaction product is CrO2Cl2. The reaction Of Cr2O3 with Cl2+O2 chlorination gas mixtures starts at about 500C. The apparent activation energy of the oxychlorination reaction of Cr2O3, as well as the apparent reaction orders with respect to the reactive gases are determined. The reaction rate is maximum for a Cl2/ O2 molar ratio equal to 4.

CHLORINATION: A POTENTIAL APPROACH FOR THE BENEFICATION OF CHROMITE:</B> N. Kanari, I. Gaballah, Mineral Processing and Environmental Engineering, lem, cnrs ura 235, ensg, inpl, bp 40, 54501 Vandeuvre, France
<P>
One of the criteria to define the market value of chromite concentrate is its chromium to iron ratio. Changing this ratio for a definite chromite is impossible by physical processing. This study investigates the possibility of increasing this ratio through the carbochlorination of chromite concentrate by Cl2+CO between 500 to 900C. The evolution of the reaction products' characteristics is determined by SEM, XRD and chemical analysis. The carbochlorination of a chromite concentrate at 600C leads to the selective partial elimination of iron allowing a higher Cr/Fe ratio of the treated concentrate. A flow-sheet for the benefication of chromite is suggested.

<P>
A thermogravimetric study has been conducted to follow the decomposition and volatilization of arsenic from enargite concentrate in nitrogen and slightly oxidizing atmospheres, Temperature has a large effect on the rate of volatilization of arsenic. Fractional volatilization of arsenic as high as 95% were reached in less than 30 min. at 650&#176;C in nitrogen atmosphere, while in slightly oxidizing atmosphere the same volatilization could be achieved in less than 20 min. It was found that As volatilizes as sulfide in nitrogen atmosphere and as a mixture of sulfide and oxide in atmospheres containing 1% oxygen.

<P>
The oxidation characteristics of solid copper matte particles under simulated Kennecott-Outokumpu Flash Converting conditions are presented. This project is concerned with the determination of the effects of operating variables on the reaction of the particles. Experiments were carried out in a large laboratory-scale flash furnace with 72 wt% Cu matte by varying initial particle size, temperature, oxygen partial pressure, oxygen to matte mass-ratio and residence time. Chemical analysis and optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the oxidation, morphology and mineralogy. Fractional conversion and sulfur removal, in general, slightly decreased with initial particle size while higher oxygen to matte mass-ratio mainly resulted in higher fractional conversion and more efficient sulfur removal. The fractional conversion values represented the overall extent of oxidation more closely than degree of sulfur removal.

<P>
Four different nickel concentrates were oxidized in a laboratory scale Laminar flow furnace in simulated flash smelting conditions. The major nickel- and iron-bearing minerals in the concentrates were pentlandite, violarite, gersdorffite, and pyrite and pyrrhotite, respectively. Thermal decomposition, ignition and oxidation behavior of nickel and iron sulfides were examined by using optical and scanning electron microscopy. General reactivity of the concentrates was monitored with sulfur removal which was most effective in violarite-based concentrate. Penlandite-concentrates needed higher experimental temperatures for complete desulfurisation and gersdorffite-based concentrate contained 5 <I>- </I>10 % of the original sulfur even at the most oxidizing conditions studied (11000C, 50 vol-% O2). The reactivity of the iron minerals were found to depend on the other minerals present in the concentrate. In this paper, observed reaction products and mineralogical changes are presented and preliminary conclusions of possible reaction mechanisms of nickel-bearing minerals are discussed.

THERMODYNAMIC MODELING OF Co-Cu-Fe-Ni-S MATTES AND APPLICATIONS IN THE SIMULATION OF SMELTING PROCESSES:</B> <I>F. Kongoli</I>, A.D. Pelton, Centre de Recherche en Calcul Thermochimique, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, P.O. Box 6079, Station Downtown, Montreal (Quebec) H3C 3A7
<P>
The Modified quasichemical model has been applied to Co-Cu-Fe-Ni-S mattes. A small set of model parameters was obtained from optimization of experimental data for the binary Co-S, Cu-S, Fe-S and Ni-S systems. The thermodynamic properties of the ternary, quaternary and quinary systems are then predicted a priori by the model with no additional adjustable parameters. Agreement with all available data for ternary and quaternary mattes is within experimental error limits. The parameters are stored as a database of the F*A*C*T thermodynamic computer system and can be used along with other F*A*C*T databases for alloy, slag, speiss and gas phases, and with Gibbs energy minimization software, to simulate equilibria during smelting processes.

ZIRCONIUM CARBIDE SYNTHESIS IN A HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA REACTOR:</B> Patrick R. Taylor, Banqiu Wu and Edgar E. Vidal, University of Idaho, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Mining Engineering, Moscow, ID 83844-3024<P>
Zirconium carbide powder has been synthesized from zircon concentrate and methane using a high temperature plasma reactor. A non-transferred DC plasma torch was used as heat source. A high temperature filter consisting of graphite felt was designed, built and operated to separate the zirconium carbide from silicon carbide during the process. Characterization of the collected powders was done by wet chemical analysis using Atomic Absorption (AA), Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). It was found that the zirconium carbide purity was around 95% with silicon carbide being the primary impurity. The powders had particle sizes between 30 and 80 nm. Based on the XRD pattern a lattice parameter of 4.6932A was calculated for the zirconium carbide. The effect of several experimental variables is presented as well as a mathematical model that describes the temperature and velocity profiles in the reactor.

PRECIPITATES ROLE IN SUPERPLASTICITY OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COPPER ALLOYS:</B> Ken R. Anderson, Joanna R. Groza, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Dept. University of California at Davis, A.T. Dumitrescu, Metallurgical Research Institute, Bucharest, Romania<P>
High strength, high thermal conductivity copper alloys are in continuous demand for<B></B> a variety of<B></B> applications such as actively cooled structures, electric and electronic parts, molding tools or welding electrodes. The goal of the present work is to understand the interrelationship between processing and microstructure of these alloys to promote superplastic behavior. Chemistry and processing variations were applied to achieve precipitation of<B></B> different dispersoids in the copper matrix. High temperature, high strain rate deformation was performed to characterize the superplastic behavior. Precipitate identification and microstructural studies were correlated to mechanical properties.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE COMMERCIAL ALUMINUM ALLOY 6063 UNDER DIFFERENT HOMOGENIZING THERMAL TREATMENTS:</B> J.R. Rendon, C.V.G Venalum, Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, B. Hidalgo, Universidad de Oriente, Cumana, Venezuela, Mokka N. Rao, Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana, Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela<P>
Cylinders of commercial aluminum alloy 6063 were homogenized under different conditions. The experimental results indicate that the general mechanical behavior as related to curves of 0.2% yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility versus homogenizing process is the same in both cases. These mechanical properties as compared to those required by plant specifications, tend to be better with increasing values of %Mg2Si in the alloy, as expected. The electron microscopy investigations revealed that in both homogenizing processes the resulting microstructure consist of significant spheroidizing of the alpha phase (AlFeSi) and fine - needle type structures of the beta phase. The alpha phase was also present in a Chinese scripture type structure. Furthermore, the slow cooling within the furnace resulted in the nucleation and growth of Mg2Si precipitates generally along the grain boundaries.

THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH FORMATION OF &quot;NATURAL&quot; METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITE BY THE APPROPRIATE THERMO-MECHANICAL TREATMENT OF POLYCRYSTALLINE METALS:</B> A. Korbel, W. Bochniak, F. Ciura, H. Dybiec, K. Piela, The Department of Structure &amp; Mechanics of Solids, Academy of Mining and Metallurgy, Mickiewicza 30, 30-059 Krakow, Poland<P>
The progress in understanding of the nature of strain localization in metallic materials and in particular understanding of the role of external (deformation conditions) and internal (material substructure) factors in the development of the tendency toward concentration of plastic flow within transgranular shear bands has laid at the background of the pointed in the title idea. Following this idea, a practical possibility of replacement a homogeneous in a micro scale mode of deformation by transgrasnular shear bands gives a chance to change the arrangement of dislocation substructure in the material from that typical for homogeneous deformation into a long wavelength (transgranular), pseudo-periodic dislocation walls. The presence or formation of such a substructure in a thermodynamically unstable matrix may result in formation of the products of phase transformation along shear bands, giving rise to a composite like structure. The experimental verification of the idea is the main aim of the work. The spectrum of different materials undergoing (post or during shear banding) different phase transformations: precipitation from supersaturated solid solution in Al-base alloys, martensitic transformation in Fe-Ni alloy, austenite-ferrite and austenite perlite transformation in the plain carbon steel and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/beta.gif"> transformation in Cu-Zn brass has been studied by use of the optical and electron microscopy. The effect of this way induced structures on some mechanical properties (strength of materials, shape memory effect in Fe-Ni alloy) is also shown in the work.

STUDIES ON GROWTH MECHANISMS AND CHARACTERISTIC FACTORS FOR THE HYDROTHERMAL PREPARATION OF A-QUARTZ CRYSTAL POWDERS:</B> Kee Jeung Lee, Kyung Won Seo, Young Mok, Department of Chemical Engineering, Ajou University, 5 Wonchon-Dong, Paldal Gu, Suwon 442-749 Korea; Hyo Shin Yu, Korea Institute of Geology, Mining &amp; Materials, Resources Utilization &amp; Materials Division, 30 Kajung-Dong, Yusung Gu, Taejon, 305-350, Korea<P>
In this study the characteristic factors and formation mechanisms for the hydrothermal preparation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-quartz crystal powders were investigated to find the optimum synthetic conditions. The degree of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">-quartz crystal face development depended on the relative growth rate of a particular form that varies considerable with the degree of supersaturation, the reaction temperature, the concentration of mineralizers, and the presence of seed crystals in the feedstock. Alkali hydroxides and alkali halides were found to be effective in the reactions as mineralizers, which added in order to increase the solubility of the feedstock. The fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif"> quartz crystal powders were obtained in the temperature range of 250-500&#176;C and pressure range of 100-300 atm. As the concentration of mineralizers increased, the particle size of crystalline powders became smaller with lower reaction temperatures. The fractional size distribution of synthetic crystal powders was depended on the hydrothermal conditions. As the reaction time and the amount of seed crystals increased, the width of particle size distribution became narrower. The weight mean particle size was in the range of 1 to 10&#181;m. The characterization of the products were carried out using XRD, SEM, PSA, FTIR, Raman Spectrometer.

THE INTRAGRANULAR FERRITE PLATE AND ITS NUCLEATING INCLUSIONS IN HAZ OF X-60 PIPE STEEL:</B> Jiang Guo Chang, Zhu Yu Ru, Guo Shu<B></B> Qiang, Xu Jian Lun, Department of Materials, Shanghai University, 149 Yan Chang Road, Shanghai 200072, China; Wang<B></B> Yue Qlang,<B></B> Pan Li Ying, Yu Di Wei, Bao Shan Iron &amp; Steel Corporation<P>
To improve the HAZ toughness of X-60 pipe steel the intragranular ferrite plate (IFP) technology was used. The characteristics of IFP is claimed to be much fine ferrite plates appear inside the original austenite grains. By means of a suitable Re, Zr, Ti additions in a bath with a higher initial oxygen potential, and a good control over the peak temperature as well as the cooling rate during welding simulation, one get a%IFP in volume over 50%, and the toughness goes up from 55J to 160J. It was found that the inclusions most effective on nucleating IFP are some deformable complex silicates which either entrapping Re, Zr, Ti oxides or containing these elements. The more the evenly distributed and effectively nucleating inclusions, the more the % IFP in volume, and the finer the microstructure of the HAZ, so the better the relevant toughness. Generally, these silicates behave as fine spheres along a line. The present authors revealed that these fine spheres result from the remelting of the silicates due to temperature raising up in the process of welding simulation. These silicates used to get a higher sulfur capacity, so MnS deposits might be observed on the periphery of the silicates. IFP was proved to be directly rooted in the [Mn] depleting zone which locates beside MnS deposits.
