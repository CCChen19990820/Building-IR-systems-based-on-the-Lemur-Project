<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
  <H3>O. Alleged Failure of USAO to Notify the Defense of Brady
Material and Other Important Information</H3><p>
  <H3>1. Introduction</H3><p>
  When the Weaver trial began, the U.S. Attorney's Office
in Boise ("USAO"), assisted by governmental investigative
agencies, had compiled and produced a large volume of materials
in discovery including thousands of pages of documents,
transcripts, numerous audio and video tapes, photographs and a
multitude of investigative reports. In addition, the USAO had
permitted defense counsel to inspect the evidence developed
during the case investigation.<p>
  Despite its efforts to comply with its discovery
obligations and the Brady rule, a number of incidents occurred
during the trial which cast doubt on whether the Government had
been totally forthcoming in its responses to the defense. These
incidents included: its resistance to produce FBI and Marshals
Service manual provisions and personnel files subpoenaed by the
defense; the failure to disclose all facets of the compensation
arrangement between the BATF and a confidential informant; the
untimely discovery of critical FBI notes relating to the
interview of Deputy Marshal cooper; the failure by Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen to notify the defense of potentially
exculpatory information learned during an interview of Idaho
State Police Captain Neal; the untimely production of crime
scene photographs and disclosure of the circumstances
surrounding how the photographs were taken; and the untimely
production of materials associated with the FBI's shooting
incident report.<p>
  <H3>2. Statement of Facts</H3><p>
  <H4>a. Defense Subpoenas for FBI and Marshals Service
Manuals and Personnel Files</H4><p>
  On November 3, 1992, defense counsel Charles Peterson
wrote a letter to Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen identifying five
classes of documents that he considered encompassed by the
discovery stipulation executed by the parties. Two of these
classes were "[a]ny manuals, memorandums or directives outlining
the procedures and standards for developing operational rules of
engagement in the field' and '[a]ny FBI arrest protocols or
instructions." Peterson requested Howen to advise him if he did
not intend to produce any of these materials. [FN1591]<p>
  Howen responded in a letter dated November 9, 1992 and
informed Peterson that he intended to provide him "with these
materials that are discoverable under rule 16 and our
stipulation regarding pre-trial exchange of Jancks Act, Grand
Jury and Rule 26.2 materials." According to Howen, the "first
prerequisite" to production was that he have possession of the
documents and that Peterson have a right to the documents under
Rule 16 or the discovery stipulation. Howen then wrote, "I am
unaware of any case law, statute or rule that compels me to
affirmatively create and/or find documents that may be in the
possession of another law enforcement agency" [FN1592] Peterson
did not respond to the November 9, 1992 letter from Howen nor
did he file a motion to compel production of the materials
identified in his November 3, 1992 letter.<p>
  On April 13, 1993, which was the first day of the Weaver
trial, the defense filed its Third Ex Parte Application for
Issuance of Subpoenas and Payment of Costs and Fees. In that
document, they requested the court to issue subpoenas for
numerous individuals and documents including:<p>
  4. Federal Bureau of Investigation, (1) for the
production of any and all FBI manuals which describe
procedures or establish standards and  rules for
the apprehension of fugitives, arrest of subjects or the use
of force. By this request the defendants intend to reach the  
publications used by members of the FBI which describe what the
government's witnesses have testified to as the 'standard rules
of engagement' for that agency, and any other policy or
procedures used by the agency and its Hostage Rescue Team
for the apprehension of  fugitives, arrest of subjects or
the use of force; and (2) the personnel files in its control
for Special Agent Lon Horiuchi, or Deputy United States
marshals William Degan, Arthur Roderick, and Larry Cooper.<p>
 The defense also requested similar manuals from the U.S.
Marshals Service as well as any personnel files of Horiuchi,
Degan, Roderick and Cooper that were in their control. [FN1593]
On April 14, Judge Lodge issued the subpoenas requested in the
ex parte order. However, he modified the order drafted by the
defense by adding the following sentence, "[p]ersonnel records
to be viewed only by defense counsel and not turned over to
third parties or the media." [FN1594]<p>
  By oral motion on April 15, defense counsel Peterson
sought to compel the production of the personnel files and the
manual provisions that the court had ordered the previous day.
In particular, Peterson was seeking the personnel file of Deputy
Marshal Cooper and the marshals Service manual provisions to
assist in his cross examination of Cooper. [FN1595] Peterson
characterized the issue as a government failure to comply with
discovery and argued that production of these materials was
required by the recently issued subpoenas.<p>
  Howen responded that he could not be expected to respond
to the subpoena when he had not been served with it nor had the
documents in hi possession. In addition, Howen told the court
that he would expect counsel at the FBI and the Marshals Service
to handle the responses to the subpoenas. However, he argued
that he was aware of no court that would allow defense counsel
to have direct access to personnel files of witnesses. [FN1596]
Assistant U.s. Attorney Lindquist informed the court that the
FBI case agent had told him that they received the subpoena and
that FBI Headquarters had been contacted. With respect to the
Marshals Service subpoena, Lindquist stated that he had now
knowledge but would take steps to ensure that the Marshals
Service responded to it. [FN1597]<p>
  The court acknowledged that the subpoena for the
personnel files raised privacy issues and that further
restrictions might be necessary but encouraged the government to
facilitate the response to the subpoenas even if the documents
were not within their control. [FN1598] Thereafter, defense
counsel Spense agreed to inform the government of the specific
requests. [FN1599]<p>
  The Marshals Service provided the applicable Marshals Service
manual provisions to the USAO on April 16. In its letter
identifying the applicable provisions, the Marshals Service
requested that the manuals be placed under seal and that access
be restricted to the prosecution and the defense. [FN1600<p>
  On April 23, the defense moved to hold the government in
contempt or to compel it to produce the requested manuals and
personnel files. As of that date, the government had filed
nothing in response to the subpoena. [FN1601 In court, defense
counsel Nevin stated that he had been advised that the subpoenas
had been served and that Howen had told him that he had the
Marshals Service materials but did not want to produce them. fn
1602 Howen responded that he viewed this issue as a discovery
dispute [FN1603 and that he was in the process of drafting a
motion for a protective order. He disputed that the subpoenas
seeking the personnel files had been served although he
acknowledged that he learned that day that the subpoenas for the
manuals had been served. Howen then referenced the November 1992
communications with defense counsel Peterson regarding the
manuals and argued that Peterson should have sought to compel
compliance earlier. [FN1604 Nevin responded that the motion to
compel was directed to the recently issued subpoenas not prior
discovery requests. [FN1605 Thereafter, Lindquist announced that
he had the requested Marshals Service personnel files but could
not relinquish them without Marshals Service approval. 1606<p>
     Judge Lodge responded that he wanted to assure himself that
the subpoenas had been served and then wanted the government to
respond either by complying or by filing a response.  Judge
Lodge stated that it did not matter to him if the response was
filed by counsel for the Marshals Service or the FBI, but he
expected the Assistant U.S. Attorneys, as officers of the court,
to assist "in moving those matters along."
If the response to the subpoena was not immediate, Judge Lodge
said "this trial will come to a halt."  Moreover, if the
government had authority that the defense has no right to the
personnel files, he wanted it to inform the court of the
authority.  The court also rejected the government's argument
that this was a discovery issue and expressed frustration over
the ambiguity of the USAO as to whether it represented the FBI
and Marshals Service on this issue. 1607    Judge Lodge then
ordered the manuals produced "forthwith", but reserved judgment
on the personnel files and requested assistance from counsel on
the issue "because the Court was concerned with it at the time
the Court issued it." 1608<p>
     Later that day, Lindquist informed the court that the FBI
had still not received a subpoena for the Horiuchi personnel file
but that it was working on its response and that the USAO was
drafting a response concerning whether the personnel files could
be produced.  With regard to the Marshals Service manual, it was
agreed the defense would have access to it, but that the
government would identify sensitive portions and then the court
would rule as to whether they could be used at trial. 1609
Howen then told the court that he would be representing the
government on this issue and apologized if he had misled the
court on this issue. 1610<p>
     On April 23, the USAO moved for a protective order objecting
to the subpoenas seeking the personnel files and the manuals.
In that motion, the USAO repeated many of the previous arguments
it had raised.  In addition, it argued that it was outside the
supervisory power of the court to order the production of the
personnel files, that the appropriate procedure was to have a law
enforcement officer familiar with the issues to conduct at
"Henthorn" review. 1611  and that the government had ordered
those reviews to be done.  It also advised the court that the
subpoenas had not been served on either agency and that the USAO
had the Marshals Service personnel files, but not the FBI file.
In addition, the government had requested the FBI and the
Marshals Service to review the manuals for sensitive information
and, if located, the government would request in camera review.
1612<p>
     On April 26, Special Agent John S. Bradford, the Principal
Legal Adviser of the Salt Lake City
Field Office, called  Supervisory Special Agent Lucy Ann Hoover
of the Civil Litigation Unit = ("CLU") of the Legal Counsel
Division at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and requested
her to conduct a Henthorn review of the personnel file of
Horiuchi.  Bradford informed Hoover that Assistant U.S. Attorney
Warren Derbridge from the USAO had informed him that an ex parte
order had been issued for the subpoena but that the USAO had not
yet received the subpoena. 1613   According to Brian Callihan, the
U.S. Marshals Service sent that subpoena to the FBI on April 26.
1614<p>
     Also that day, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth telephoned Joseph
Davis, Assistant Director of the Legal Counsel Division at FBI
Headquarters to discuss the FBI response to the defense subpoena
for the FBI manual provisions and the Horiuchi personnel file.
He told Davis that the court wanted the manual produced as soon
as possible.  On April 27, Davis wrote to Beau McFarland that he
did not know the details of this matter, but assured Ellsworth
that he would investigate and provide whatever assistance was
needed.  Davis then requested McFarland to consult with
appropriate CLU personnel to insure that the FBI was not in
contempt and that appropriate arguments and objections were made
to any damaging releases. 1615<p>
     On April 28, someone, presumably Beau McFarland, forwarded
the April 27 memo from Davis to Clawson in CLU I and wrote,
"Please find out the status of this matter and advise me this
morning.   I believe Lucy Hoover is assigned to it now."  Later
that day, Clawson responded to the routing slip by expressing
surprise at Ellsworth's comments since the "SU PLA processed the
responsive manual provisions and provided them to the AUSA on
Monday, 4/26."  With regard to the request for the personnel
file, Clawson stated that the FBI had still not been served but
after consulting with the Assistant U.S. Attorney had decided to
treat it as a Henthorn request.  Clawson indicated that they
would file a motion to quash if the subpoena for the personnel
file was ever served. 1616<p>
     Sometime in late April 1993, the FBI gave the USAO a copy of
the requested manual provisions. 1617 The next day, Howen
wrote a letter to defense counsel Peterson
and enclosed FBI manual provisions that were responsive to the
subpoena.1618   On April 29, Hoover sent the completed Henthorn
review of the Horiuchi personnel file to Howen. 1619  Hoover had
found no exculpatory or impeachment information in the file.<p>
     The defense objected to the government's motion for a
protective order on April 30, 1993.  At that time, the defense
stated that it had received the Marshals Service training manuals
and that the USAO had the Marshals Service manuals and the
Marshals Service personnel files.  With regard to the FBI
materials, the defense said that the FBI had produced the
training manuals but not the personnel manual to the USAO.  The
defense argued that pursuant to the terms of the discovery
stipulation, the government was obligated to produce exculpatory
material and thus, they should have reviewed and produced any
such information contained in the personnel files without the
need for an additional request.  The defense admitted that their
request for the complete personnel files may have been too broad,
but believed that the court's modifications to its order
adequately addressed the privacy concerns. 1620<p>
      On May 10, the government filed its Thirteenth Addendum to
its Response to the Discovery Stipulation in which it included
the Henthorn certifications for Horiuchi, Roderick, Cooper and
Degan. 1621   Defense counsel Peterson raised the personnel file
issue again in court that day and repeated his argument that the
defendants were entitled access to the personnel files. Lindquist
indicated that neither the FBI nor the Marshals Service had
received a subpoena for the personnel files 1622 and that he and
Howen had made it clear to defense counsel that the personnel
files and manuals could only be obtained by subpoena. 1623
The court opined that the procedure set forth in the Henthorn
case was controlling and the complete personnel file did not need
to be produced unless such production was necessary to satisfy
the Government's disclosure obligations. 1624<p>
     Later that day, defense counsel Spence and Nevin sent Howen
a letter requesting to review the personnel files of Roderick,
Hunt, Thomas, Norris, Cooper, Degan and Horiuchi and detailed a
list of "matters and issues" for which they were looking in these
files.  Spence also requested such information from the personnel
files of all federal agents that the government intended to call
as witnesses. 1625   Howen answered that letter on May 12, and
refused to provide the information because the request was
untimely and exceeded the scope of information that was required
to be produced under applicable federal law. 1626<p>
     On May 17, the court ruled on the personnel file issue.  It
noted at the outset that even though the personnel files were not
specifically addressed in the discovery stipulation, the federal
prosecutor, under Ninth Circuit law, has the obligation by virtue
of his oath of office to produce Brady material without a court
order.  Furthermore, the court held the "[c]ounsel for the
government should have undertaken this search in advance of
trial, on their own initiative."  It approved the procedure
proposed by the government which was to have the law enforcement
agent knowledgeable about the issues in the case to review the
files for Brady material.  If Brady material did not exist, the
defense was to be informed; if Brady material was located, it was
to be presented to the defense; and if the material was
questionable, the court was to conduct an in camera review and
make a determination as to whether it should be produced.  The
court ordered that this review should be done no later than two
days before the witness is to testify and with regard to those
witnesses who have already testified, the review should be
conducted "post haste." 1627 Later that day, defense counsel
Spence stated that the only personnel file that they needed was
the file of Lon Horiuchi. 1628<p>
     With regard to the manual provisions, Howen recalls that the
Marshals Service made the requested materials available almost
immediately but that the FBI did not make its provisions
available until later.  However, Howen did not find the content
or the speed of the FBI response to be unreasonable.  Indeed, one
of his main recollections about the subpoena for the manual was
that the response that the FBI gave was too broad and mistakenly
included sensitive portions of the manual. 1629   He also agreed
with their resistance to the subpoena for the personnel files and
concurred that there was no authority that would support giving
the defense access to those files. 1630   His only dispute with
the FBI on this issue was that they did not provide him some
assistance in fashioning a response to the subpoena. 1631<p>
     Lindquist did not recall having any significant involvement
in obtaining the subpoenaed manuals and personnel files and
recalled the matter being handled by Howen. 1632   Although
Lindquist recalled that the Marshalls Service quickly produced
the requested materials, he had little recollection of what
actions that the FBI took in this regard. 1633<p>
      <H4> b.  Financial Compensation of Informant Fadeley</H4><p>
     It was the gun sale between Weaver and a government
informant that provided the basis for the initial criminal
charges brought against him.   The Government also planned to
introduce statements that Weaver had made to the informant during
four taped conversations as evidentiary support for its
conspiracy theory.  After informal attempts to learn the identity
of the informant had failed, 1634  Weaver's attorneys requested
this information in a pretrial motion as well as any evidence
that would affect the bias or credibility of the informant
including "any promises of consideration given to the informant."
1635 On March 28, 1993, the government responded to this motion and
refused to provide the requested information citing the
untimeliness of the motion and the risks that disclosure posed on
the informant. 1636 Thereafter, on April 12th, the court ordered the government to
provide the requested information.<p>
     On April 13, the first day of trial, the Government
identified the informant as Kenneth Fadeley.  With respect to any
compensation paid to Fadeley, the government stated, "Mr. Fadeley
[sic] has received reimbursement for expenses in the approximate
amount of $500.00, but no salary." 1637   Before filing this
addendum, Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen conferred with BATF Agent
Herbert Byerly, who informed him that Fadeley had just been paid
expenses. 1638<p>
      Kenneth Fadeley began testifying on April 19 and continued
into April 20 at which time defense counsel began cross examining
him.  Toward the end of the cross examination, defense counsel
inquired about the compensation that Fadeley had received for his
work on the Weaver matter.  Fadeley testified that when he works
for BATF, he is paid for expenses which would include such items
as gas and food.  He could not recall how much money BATF paid
him for expenses in 1986, but agreed that it was greater than
$1.00, but less than $10,000.1639   From 1987-1989, BATF paid
Fadeley for "just" expenses, but he was unable to recall the
amount paid. 1640  Later, after Fadeley agreed that he had not
assisted the government in this case for money and that BATF had
never paid him any type of salary other than the payment of
expenses, the following exchange occurred:<p>
                    Q        ......When you first started working
for ATF, were you told that you would be paid on a case-by-case
basis?            
                                                   <p>
                    A        I was told I'd be paid expenses for
my work.<p>
                     Q        Expenses.  Were you told that you'd
get paid after a case was made against a person?<p>
                     A        After we concluded a case, there
may be a monetary settlement, possibly.<p>
                     Q        Okay.  "After we concluded a case,
there may be a monetary settlement"?  Oh, let's talk about this
case then. First of all, in order to conclude a case, you would
have to get a guy to trial in the case, is that right?<p>
                     A         I would assume so.<p>
                      Q        And you would assume that not only
would you have to get him convicted, right?<p>
                      A         If he was guilty.<p>
                      Q         Well, if you don't get a
conviction, you don't get any money; isn't that right?<p>
                      A         I would assume so.<p>
                      Q         And that's not just your
assumption, sir, that's your understanding about this case
too, isn't it?  If Randy Weaver gets acquitted of this gun case,
you don't get paid, right?<p>
                      A          I guess so. 1641<p>

Following this exchange, Fadeley testified that he did not know
how much money he would be paid if Weaver were convicted and
insisted that the amount of any future award had no impact on his
testimony. 1642<p>
     On April 20, defense counsel Spence moved in open court to
strike the testimony of Fadeley and to dismiss all counts of the
indictment based upon the Fadeley testimony.  Spence argued that
Fadeley was a contingent fee witness and that it was unlawful to
permit such testimony to be used at trial. 1643   Howen denied
that Fadeley was a contingent fee witness and argued that
Fadeley's testimony regarding any future
compensation that he might receive was partially based on his
confusion regarding money Fadeley might receive in the future
under the witness protection program to compensate for "any
differential or loss to him in either his job, his home, or other
items."1644   Howen then represented that BATF Agent Byerly, who
communicated with Fadeley regarding financial compensation, would
testify that Fadeley was paid for expenses and then was told that
he "could be held for an award at a later time."1645   Howen
maintained that such an arrangement did not constitute a
contingent fee agreement.  Thereafter, the court took the matter
under advisement but declined to declare a mistrial. 1646<p>
     The government recalled Byerly to address the Fadeley
compensation issue.  Byerly testified that Fadeley was neither an
agent nor a salaried employee of BATF.  He explained that he had
made an agreement with Fadeley whereby Fadeley would be
reimbursed for his necessary investigative expenses associated
with attending the Aryan Nations summer conferences in 1986, 1987
and 1989 and that for the entire period that Fadeley was
assisting BATF, he was paid expenses of $445.  In addition,
Byerly testified that he had informed Fadeley that he could
receive an award after a case was completed.  Byerly stated, "I
explained to Mr. Fadeley that at the end of the case, whatever it
might be, at the end of the judicial proceedings that I would
submit his name to my supervisors for an award." 1647  According
to Byerly, his recommendation would be reviewed by several layers
of supervisors who could approve, increase or reduce the award.
Byerly insisted that the award was not influenced by the outcome
of a case and that he had never informed Fadeley otherwise. 1648
Indeed, Byerly testified there were instances where informants
received awards for work on cases that were never prosecuted. 1649
In another case in which Fadeley assisted but which was not
prosecuted, Byerly recommended an award of $2,500. 1650   He said
that he anticipated that he was going to recommend that Fadeley
receive an award of $3,500 for his work on the Weaver case.
Byerly insisted that Fadeley was mistaken if he believed that
the award was contingent upon there being a conviction in the
case. 1651<p>
     On April 21, defense counsel filed a motion to strike the
Fadeley testimony arguing that it was improper because Fadeley
had been promised a contingent fee if Weaver were convicted.  In
addition, they complained that the prosecutors had an obligation
to disclose this arrangement to the defense prior to trial but
had failed to do so.  Moreover, they argued that the government's
denial that Fadeley had been paid any fee constituted misconduct.
1652   In its response, the government denied that a contingent
fee arrangement existed between BATF and Fadeley and then
repeated its argument that Fadeley's responses were affected by
his confusion over financial benefits he might receive under the
witness protection program.  Howen also denied having prior
knowledge of the possible monetary award from BATF. 1653<p>
     Judge Lodge ruled on the motion to strike on May 17 and
found that although "Fadeley believed that he was involved in a
contingency fee arrangement," the testimony of agent Byerly
indicated that the government did not intend for a contingency
fee arrangement to exist. 1654   Consequently, the circumstances
did not exist to warrant the striking of the Fadeley testimony.
However, Judge Lodge ruled that a cautionary instruction
regarding how to evaluate the credibility of Fadeley would be
appropriate. 1655 On May 19th, the Government informed the
defense of the amounts that Fadeley had received for expenses,
and awards and the amount of the proposed cash award. 1656<p>
     Howen told investigators that he was terribly surprised and
embarrassed by the Fadeley disclosure. 1657
He insisted that the first he learned of the possible award was
when defense counsel elicited it on cross examination.  Prior to
that time, Howen understood from Byerly that Fadeley received no
salary and had only received reimbursement for expenses.  Nothing
seemed unusual about that arrangement to Howen for several
reasons:  Fadeley wanted to assist law enforcement because his
close friend on the Spokane Police force had been killed while on
duty; Fadeley viewed his cooperation as a civic duty; and Fadeley
simply enjoyed undercover work.  Howen could not recall whether
he ever questioned Fadeley about the compensation issue but stated
that if Fadeley had disclosed the possibility of a future award,
he would have disclosed it to the defense.  Although this was the
first time that Howen had heard of such future awards, he
admitted that he probably should have asked Byerly more probing
questions concerning Fadeley's understanding regarding the
possibility of future compensation. 1658<p>
     Howen questioned Byerly again after Fadeley had testified.
Based on this conversation, Howen understood that the future
award was not contingent upon convicting Weaver, but rather, upon
the recommendation given by Byerly.  This recommendation was
influenced by the assistance that Fadeley had provided on all the
cases, including Weaver, in which he was involved.  Byerly could
not explain why he had failed to disclose the possible award
earlier.  Howen said Byerly was very apologetic for not
disclosing the understanding to Howen. 1659<p>
     Byerly said that Howen had met with Fadeley on at least two
occasions when Byerly was not present and, as a result, "was
under the false assumption that AUSA Howen had discussed with
[Fadeley] any financial arrangements that he...had discussed with
ATF." 1660   Byerly insisted that he did not intentionally
withhold information about the award from Howen and that if Howen
had asked whether any compensation would be paid at the end of
the case, that he would have told him about his intention to
recommend an award for Fadeley.  However, from Howen's questions,
Byerly thought that Howen was seeking information about monies
already paid to Fadeley rather than monies that might be paid in
the future. 1661<p>
     When Department of Treasury investigators questioned Fadeley
about his trial testimony, he told them  that he had misspoken
regarding his understanding of whether he would receive a
monetary payment in the Weaver matter.  Fadeley stated that
Byerly had told him that "there would be some unspecified payment
at the end of a case" but that the payment was never linked to
whether a case went to trial or a conviction being obtained.  It
was Fadeley's understanding that the payment would be based upon
the work that he performed and the information that he obtained
in the case. Fadeley attributed his misstatement to being "tired"
and having lost his "focus and attention."1662  Fadeley stated that
he met with Howen on many occasions before testifying at trial.  At
none of these sessions did Howen question him about the compensation
he was receiving.  Thus, Fadeley was surprised when he was
questioned about this topic by the defense and was disappointed
that Howen had not questioned him on redirect to clarify his
understanding regarding any future payment he might receive. 1663<p>
                      <H4>c.  Late Production of the Halley Notes</H4><p>
     After Deputy Marshals Cooper and Roderick were escorted from
Ruby Ridge, they and Deputy Marshals Norris, Hunt and Thomas were
taken to a condominium on Schweitzer Mountain to rest.  On the
afternoon of August 22, FBI Special Agents Joseph Venus and
George Halley interviewed Cooper at the courthouse at Bonners
Ferry, Idaho.  According to Calley, Venkus asked the questions
while Calley was responsible for taking notes.  Calley told
investigators that what started as a question and answer style
interview, evolved into Cooper giving a narrative statement of
events.  Calley complained that he had difficulty keeping up with
Cooper and, as a result, he left blanks in his interview notes
with the intent of returning later to fill in the missing words.
1664  Shortly after the interview, Calley prepared a one or two
page handwritten summary of the sequence of events recounted by
Cooper.  Then, using his handwritten notes of the interview,
Calley prepared a rough draft of the FD-302 of the interview.
1665<p>
     As one of the three marshals involved in the August 21
shootings at Ruby Ridge, the testimony of Cooper was critical to
both the prosecution and the defense.  The FD-302 of Cooper and
the handwritten notes of that interview became very controversial
documents in the Weaver case because certain entries in those
documents were in error and conflicted with the subsequent
testimony of Cooper. 1666  Cooper first discovered these errors
when he reviewed a draft of the document. 1667  For example,
Cooper insisted that he had not shot Sammy Weaver.  He
consistently maintained that, after Harris had fired the shots that
hit Degan, he fired a three-round burst at Harris, who fell to the
ground "like a sack of potatoes."  Cooper then directed his
weapon on Sammy, but did not shoot him because he could not see
if Sammy was carrying a gun and because Sammy had not fired at
Degan.  Later, Cooper fired a second three-round burst at no
particular target, but in the direction from which he had last
received fire.  After he took these shots, Cooper saw Sammy
running out of view and up the trail leading to the cabin. 1668<p>
     Calley insisted to investigators that he never recalled
Cooper ever stating or suggesting that he shot Sammy Weaver. 1669
However, in his handwritten notes of the interview, Calley wrote
that Cooper said that after he had fired his second round burst
of three shots, he saw Harris proceed on the trail.  Halley told
investigators that this was an error on his part and that Cooper
had said that it was Sammy Weaver, not Harris, that he saw going
up the trail. 1670   Indeed, Venus confirmed that Cooper was
convinced that he had shot Harris. 1671   Calley told
investigators that Cooper did not waiver when recounting the
events of August 21, 1992 and to the extent that mistakes existed
in the FD-302s, these mistakes were his fault.  He attributed
these errors to either fast note taking or plain error in writing
his notes. 1672<p> Calley prepared two final FD-302s of the Cooper interview;
the first was dated August 29, 1992; and the second was dated
August 30, 1992.  He placed his interview notes and the rough
drafts 1673  in a 1-A envelope 1674 and sent them to files.
According to Venkus, Calley began taking notes of the Cooper
interview on a yellow note pad.  When Calley ran out of paper,
Venkus gave him a white note pad on which to continue his notes.
Thereafter, Calley drafted that 302 of Cooper on a white note
pad. Calley placed all of the Cooper interview notes that were
written on yellow paper in the "1-A" envelope belonging to the
Cooper 302 file.  However, he placed that portion of the
interview notes that were written on white paper together with
the handwritten draft of the Cooper 302 in another file folder.
Venkus speculated that Calley forgot that he had used two different
kinds of paper in the Cooper interview and,  thus, assumed by
placing all of the yellow sheets in the 1-A file that it
constituted a full set of interview notes. 1675<p>
     On  September 3, 1992, the USAO requested the FBI to produce
"[a]ll 302's involving the interviews of Deputy Marshals Hunt,
Norris, Thomas, Cooper and Roderick, together with draft 302's,
altered 302's and notes of interviewing agents." 1676   Before
the trial began, the USAO produced the two final Cooper FD-302
interview statements 1677  and the 12-page set of rough notes of
the August 22 interview of Cooper. 1678<p>
     In late May 1993, 5 weeks after the trial had started,
Calley discovered the missing portions of his interview notes and
the draft 302 of Cooper in his desk. 1679  Calley immediately
informed Venkus who contacted Howen.  Thereafter, Calley was told
that Howen would call him within 30 minutes to discuss the notes.
It was one to two days later that Deputy Marshal Masaitis
requested Calley to come to the federal building to explain the
notes and why they were discovered late.  Calley stated that
although Howen was present, he appeared preoccupied with other
matters and left most of the interview to
Masaitis. 1680<p>
     Howen believed that Dillon or one of the case agents
informed him of the discovery of the notes.  Dillon told Howen
that Calley had found the notes in his desk and had forgotten to
place them in the 1-A envelope belonging to the Cooper FD-302.
Howen recalled that Dillon indicated that if you examined the
notes and compared them with what had already been produced, it
was obvious that the notes were the missing parts of what had
previously been produced.  Howan stated that his initial reaction
to the disclosure was that he could not believe it.  Because of
the demands of the trial, Howen produced the notes to the defense
without reviewing them closely. 1681    Neither Howen nor Dillon
thought that Calley intentionally concealed these notes. 1682 
Howen recalled Calley being extremely apologetic.  Howen
believed that it was just an "honest mistake." 1683<p>
     On May 21, Howen produced the newly found Calley notes to
the defense. 1684  This production occurred several days after
the Fadeley compensation controversy had erupted and the same day
in which Howen's interview with Captain David Neal was disclosed.
1685  Defense counsel Spence argued that some of these notes were
written by Cooper, not Calley, because the handwriting was
different and because it was not written in the third person.
1686  The court then stated:<p>
          The Court is going to say that the Court is very
disturbed by what has happened here or what appears to have
happened here, because in this instance, the Court does not think
counsel should make representations to the Court that they do not
know.  If these are, in fact, partly the notes of Mr. Cooper,
that is the way they should be referred to.  If they are the
notes of someone else, they are the notes of someone else.  They
should have been disclosed as soon as they were found, and when
they are found in the desk drawer, that seems to me like maybe it
is one of the most logical places to be looking, whether they be
Mr. Cooper's notes or somebody that has been interviewed by Mr.
Cooper.  The blame probably trickles down beyond the U.S.
Attorney's office. 1687 The court then expressed extreme concern
over the untimely disclosure of Howen's interview with Captain
Neal and ruled that he was continuing the trial until Monday,
May 24 to permit the defense time to interview Captain Neal. 1688<p>
     When the trial resumed on May 24, defense counsel Spence
argued that Cooper should be returned to the stand in light of
the recent production of the Calley notes which Spence argued
were partially authored by Cooper.  Howen objected to this
request and represented that all of the notes were written by
Calley, not Cooper, thus nothing could be accomplished by
recalling Cooper.  The court took the matter under advisement.
1689<p>    <H4>d. Neal Notes</H4><p>
     A pivotal issue in the Weaver trial was who fired the first
shot at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992.  The government argued
that it was Kevin Harris while the defense maintained that it was
Deputy Marshal Roderick when he shot the Weaver dog Striker.
Because of the importance of this issue to the defense case, any
information that the government had regarding this issue,
including pertinent statements made by Roderick, was obviously
important to the defense and required to be produced under the
Brady and Jencks doctrines.<p>
        On April 23, 1993, the court recessed the trial until May
3rd.  During this recess, Howen attended to matters that he had
been unable to reach earlier, including the interviews of some of
the officers on the Critical Response Team ("CRT") of the Idaho
State Police. 1690  The next day, Howen interviewed Captain David
Neal, commander of the CRT, and other members of the CRT who
rescued the three marshals on the night of August 21,
1993. 1691 No other investigative team member accompanied Howen
on these interviews. 1692<p>
     Neal stated that during the interview, Howen was interested
in whether it was the normal practice of the CRT to wear
camouflage clothing when responding to an incident.  Later, Neal
told Howen that the first thing that Roderick said to him was
that, "I shot the dog."  Based on his discussion with Roderick on
the night of August 21, Neal told Howen that it was his
impression that the shot fired by Roderick, which killed the dog,
was the first shot fired at the Y.  According to Neal, Howen took
notes and remarked that this information would have to be given
to the defense. 1693<p>
     When investigators from this inquiry questioned Howen about
the Neal interview, he recalled that Neal had told him that when
he had questioned Roderick about what had occurred, Roderick had
responded that he shot the dog.  Howen did not interpret the Neal
statements as indicating that Roderick had communicated that he
had shot the dog first before any other shots were fired. 1694
However, Howen acknowledged that there was the "potential" for
one to argue that perhaps Roderick was indicating that he had
shot the dog first.  To clarify this issue, Howen planned to
elicit testimony from a few CRT officers which would shot that
the Roderick comment did not indicate the sequence of the shots
fired, but rather, was simply an admission by Roderick that he
had shot the dog.  Howen believed that such an approach satisfied
his obligations under the Brady doctrine. 1695    He recalled
informing Lindquist of the substance of the substance of the Neal
interview and of the possibility that the defense would attempt
to undermine the Roderick testimony regarding the sequence of the
shooting. 1696<p>
     Late in the afternoon of May 20, almost four weeks after the
Neal interview, Howan informed defense counsel of the substance
of the interview and provided them with a copy of his interview
notes.  At that time, Roderick had begun to testify.  On the next
day, defense counsel Nevin argued to the court that this
disclosure was "pivotal" to the defense case 1697  and was in
distinct conflict with the government's argument that Kevin
Harris fired the first shot. 1698   Thereafter, defense counsel
requested the court to recess the proceedings and to permit them
the opportunity to interview Neal to determine the full extent of
his testimony. 1699  Howen responded that he had disclosed the
names of the CRT members long before the trial started and that
he had not had an opportunity to interview them until the recess
in April. 1700   Howen then stated:<p>
As counsel states when I talked to. . . Captain
Neal, he made certain statements to me about Mr.
Roderick coming forward.  He was not able to put
them in a sequence, his best recollection was
because they were standing right next to the dog.
Mr. Roderick made a comment that he had shot the
dog, and then there was an inquiry about how Mr.
Degan had died, and Mr. Degan had died over
here. 1701<p>
Howen then explained to the court that he was making the
disclosure now because he had realized that he might not be
calling Neal as a witness and "felt compelled to reveal this
matter to defense counsel so they could examine him, which is what
I did yesterday." 1702  Lindquist represented to the court that
Neal had not indicated to Howen any chronology as to when he shot
the dog and that the first time that Howen had heard this
information was during the interview.  Although Lindquist conceded
that the information disclosed in the Neal interview constituted
Brady material, he disputed that it was "pivotal." 1703<p>
     After expressing its concern over learning about the newly
discovered notes of Special Agent Calley, the court stated,<p>
    The thing that is even more disturbing to
the Court is whether or not this chronology of
events with Mr. Neal was known about three weeks
ago, because obviously we are talking about
Brady material rather than Jencks [sic] material.
It is exculpatory if it is even questionable
about what was said by Mr. Roderick shortly
after the event.  It is critical to a fair
hearing to have this ferreted out and known
about before there is any further direct or
cross-examination by Mr. Roderick.  We have
asked these jurors to come in here and we are
taking two months out of their lives. Sometimes
we pass off as cavalier the time of judges, the
judges being the jurors, and it is totally
inexcusable when we have to do what the Court is
going to have to do today, and that is delay
this trial over until Monday.<p>
    The Court has felt during this trial that
there has been a lot of pressure on counsel.
That there have been all kinds of things coming
onto the Court's desk from both sides almost
every day, from activities that you do through
the night, and it is apparent that some things
can be overlooked, some things may be not seen
as important as they are, but this to the Court
is a very embarrassing situation.  The Court
wants both sides to take stock of what has
happened here and make doubly sure that this
does not happen the rest of this trial. [FN1704]
       
      On May 21, defense counsel Peterson and an unidentified
individual interviewed Captain Neal.  Neal described his rescue
of Roderick and the statement that Roderick made that he had shot
the dog.  Neal stated that he was careful to explain that it was
his impression that Roderick shot the dog first, but that Roderick
never said, nor admitted that he shot the dog first.  Thereafter,
defense counsel told Neal that they would be calling him as a
witness. [FN1705]<p>
     According to Howen, he made the disclosure to the court and
the defense on May 20, because he realized that, due to pressure
from the court to complete the trial, he was not going to have
time to call all of the witnesses that he had originally planned.
He decided not to call Neal as a witness but recognized that the
defense might want the opportunity to question Neal.   When asked
if he considered the Neal interview to constitute Brady
information, Howen responded, "[c]lose to it. Yeah." [FN1706}  He
explained that he had not disclosed the information sooner because
he had planned to question Neal on direct and to make it clear that
the Roderick statement did not relate to the sequence of the
shooting.  He believed that bringing such information out on
direct examination complied with Brady, especially when he had
already informed the defense that Neal was a potential witness and
the defense could have interviewed him. [FN1707]<p>
        Lindquist recalled Howen calling him shortly after
completing the Neal interview, relaying the substance of what Neal
had said and then expressing the view that perhaps the information
could constitute Brady material.  Lindquist, who could not recall
exactly what Neal was reported to have said about the Roderick
statements, opined to Howen that they should treat the statements
as Brady and produce them to the defense.  He recalled Howen
stating, "well, I agree and I just.  .  .wanted to hear you say
it.  .   .   ."<p>
     Although he could not recall the reason why this information
was not disclosed until three weeks after the interview, [FN1708]
Lindquist stated that he was not concerned about the delay
because he thought that the information was marginally Brady and
that the delay was not intentional.  He attributed the delay to a
simple oversight caused by the intense demands imposed by the
trial. [FN1709]  Lindquist did not specifically recall Howen
attributing the delay to his initial plan to elicit the testimony
from Neal on direct, but opined that it was consistent with what
he recalls of their discussions during this period.  Lindquist
did not think that such a theory violated either the Jencks Act
or the Brady rule.  With regard to the Brady rule, Lindquist
first opined that such information should be produced "with
diligence" but then stated that revealing the information on
direct would satisfy Brady, especially if there was no prejudice
to the defendant. [FN1710]<p>
         <H4>e.  The L-1 Bullet and L Bullet Photographs</H4><p>
     On August 31, 1992, FBI Special Agent Larry Wages
participated in the collection of evidence at the "Y" at Rudy
Ridge.  Also participating in the search were Special Agents
Cadigan, Taister, and Grover from the FBI lab. [FN1711] 
As evidence was located, it was marked with a  flag, given a letter
designation, marked on the evidence diagram and then was
photographed. [FN1712] During the search, Wages later became known
as the "L-1" bullet  to the FBI and the "pristine" or the "Magic"
bullet to the defense.  Wages recalled that, pursuant to his
request, Cadigan photographed the bullet.  However, later, Wages
realized that he needed to obtain a letter designation from the
photographer and then to have a new picture taken with the letter
designation.  Despite his efforts, Wages was unable to find a
photographer. [FN1713]<p>
     In the middle of the morning, Supervisory Special Resident
Agent Dillon informed Special Agent Gregory Rampton that they
believed that Weaver would surrender shortly and, in anticipation
of the surrender, he wanted to hold a briefing to discuss the
expected search of the Weaver cabin.  Thereafter, Rampton sent a
messenger to the Y to instruct Wages to end the search and return
to the command post for a briefing. [FN1714] Because Kelly Kramer,
the photographer, was still unavailable to assign letter
designations to the bullets and then photograph them, Wages
placed flags where the bullets were located, placed each bullet
in a plastic bag and took them with him to the briefing. [FN1715]
When Wages arrived at the command post, he showed Rampton the
bullet, which subsequently became known as the "L-1" bullet.[FN1716]
After the search of the cabin was completed, Wages returned to
the Y, replaced the bullets at the locations of the flags and
then had Kramer photograph the bullets in place.[FN1717] To account
for the fact that he had removed evidence, Wages indicated in his
log that the search terminated after the search at the cabin.
[FN1718]<p>
     On January 8, 1993, defense attorneys Spence and Matthews
had an opportunity to examine the physical evidence collected by
the government.  The L-1 bullet was among the evidence reviewed.
When Special Agent Rampton told them that the "L" bullet may have
been fired from Sara Weaver's mini 14 rifle, [FN1719] Spence
reportedly accused the FBI of having "staged" the evidence since
the bullet had very few markings on it and the photograph of it
showed it simply laying on the ground.  Rampton responded that
the evidence could not have been staged since the bullet was
found before the seizure of Sara Weaver's gun.  To support his
argument, Rampton checked the search log completed by Wages.
However, when Rampton read the log, he noticed that it indicated
that the "L" bullet was discovered on August 31, during a search
that began at approximately 9:40 a.m. and ended at approximately
6:00 p.m., which was after Weaver had surrendered and the mini 14
rifle had been seized.  Rampton told  Spence that he would review
the investigative notes of Wages to resolve the issue.
Thereafter, Rampton examined the investigative notes of Wages,
which indicated that the search at the Y concluded at 11:00
rather than 6:00.  To resolve the discrepancy, Rampton called
Wages and explained the issue.  Wages then explained to Rampton
the complete circumstances surrounding the photographing of the L
bullet. [FN1720]<p>
  Rampton told investigators that after his conversation with
Wages, he called defense counsel Peterson and "explained the
situation concerning the 'L' bullet."  In addition, he called
Howen and Lindquist and explained the entire matter to them,
including how the L bullet was photographed and the allegations
made by defense counsel Spence that the evidence had been staged.
According to Rampton, Howen and Lindquist "noted the incident
without apparent concern." [FN1721] Howen, however, did not recall
Rampton explaining how the L photographs were taken or informing
him that he had any discussions with defense counsel Peterson
about how the photographs had been taken. [FN1722] Lindquist also
did not recall discussing this issue with Rampton during this
time period, although he did recall the issue coming up later.
[FN1723]Rampton prepared no reports of interview indicating that he
had provided this information to anyone in the USAO or to defense
counsel.<p>
     Howen did admit that Wages informed him about the
circumstances surrounding the photographing of the L bullets
during an April 1993 pretrial interview.  Howen made a note of
this disclosure in his notes; Wages requested and received a copy
of these notes from Howen immediately after their discussion.
[FN1724] At the time, the disclosure did not strike Howen as
"significant" and he forgot about this information until talking
to Wages in May 1993 before Wages was to testify at trial.  At
that time, Wages reminded Howen of the L-1 bullet and that it had
been removed prior to being photographed.  When Wages reminded him
about this information, Howen decided that he could not use the
photographs to represent to the jury that this was how the
evidence was found.  Howen recalled that it was at that time that
he informed the defense and that after he made this disclosure,
Wages reminded him that he told Howen about the pictures in
April.  Howen then reviewed his early April 1993 notes and
confirmed that Wages was correct. [FN1725]<p>
     Wages and Rampton provided a slightly different version of
events.  They insisted that when Wages reminded Howen in May 1993
of the circumstances surrounding the photographing of the L-1
bullet, Howen immediately questioned if he had been informed
earlier.  Wages and Rampton then produced Wages' copy of Howan's
earlier notes as proof.  According to Rampton, when Howen was
presented with his notes, he just stared at them. [FN1726]  This
conversation occurred before Howan disclosed the information to
the court.  In addition, Wages stated that although he had told
Howen in April that all of the photographs of the L bullets had
been taken in the same manner, he forgot to remind Howen of this
in May at the time he was preparing Wages to testify.  Thus, when
Howen informed the court that the L-1 bullet had been removed
before being photographed, Wages had to tell Howen that the other
L bullets also fell into that category, thus requiring Howen to
go back to the court and provide the defense with this
information.[FN1727] In addition, during this time period, the
case agents discovered two packages of photographs in a case
storage area that had been overlooked.  It appeared that some of
these pictures were of the L series bullets and had been taken
before Wages had removed them.<p>
     The record provides support for the version of events
detailed by Wages and Rampton.  On May 25, Howen told the court
that the agents had notified him that they had discovered a
packet of search photographs, including pictures of the L series
bullets, that had been stored at another location.  Howen stated
that they would produce these photographs to the defense later
that day. [FN1728]<p>
     After the luncheon recess on May 25, defense counsel Spence
complained about the late production of the photographs and
argued that they should have been produced earlier in discovery.
[FN1729] Howen argued that discovery was a continuing obligation
and that he was producing materials as soon as he learned of
them.  He then stated, "I came to find out a couple of days ago,
maybe a week or so ago, the photograph identified with the L-1
bullet was not as it was found.  As a result of that, I was not
going to use that particular photograph."[FN1730] In response to
defense questions, Howen briefly explained that the bullets had
been removed and then replaced later before the
photographs were taken.  From their subsequent remarks, this was
obviously the first time that defense counsel Nevin and Spence had
learned about the circumstances surrounding the photographing of
the L bullets. [FN1731]<p>
    Howen told the court that due to how the L series
photographs had been taken, he did not believe that it would be
appropriate to offer them into evidence.  In addition, he seemed
to indicate that some of the photographs produced that morning
had been taken by either Michael Taister or Cyrus Glover before
the bullets were removed but that Larry Wages, the testifying
agent, had not been present during the taking of these
photographs and thus was unaware of them. [FN1732] Howen then
explained that Wages had removed the bullet when a photographer
was unavailable and later had returned with a photographer to
take the picture.[FN1733]<p>
     Following an afternoon recess, Spence complained that Howen
had just informed him that the entire "L" series of
photographs--not just the L-1-- had been photographed after the
bullet or bullet fragment had been removed and then replaced.
Spence then recounted the recent untimely disclosures that the
prosecution had made, including the Neal interview and the Cooper
interview notes.  With regard to the L series photographs, Spence
maintained that they constituted Brady material that should have
been disclosed "long ago" and requested the court to impose
sanctions against the government and to inform the jury of what
had occurred. [FN1734]  Defense counsel Nevin echoed the concerns
articulated by Spence. [FN1735]<p>
     Howen accepted responsibility for the late production of the
photographs and told the court that it was not until the lunch
recess that he was advised that the entire L series, not just the
L-1 photograph, had been taken after having been removed and then
replaced.  Howen argued that he had produced the materials as
soon as he became aware of them and that he did not believe that
the defense request for sanctions was appropriate. [FN1736] The
court accepted Howen's representations that the information and
the photographs had been disclosed as soon as they had been
discovered and refused to impose sanctions or to inform the jury
as requested by the defense. [FN1737]<p>
     Two days later, Larry Wages testified and described the
August 31 search at the Y and explained that the items seized
were given the designation of "L".  He then testified that in the
early afternoon, he was informed that Mike Dillon wanted him to
go to another area.  Because the bullets had not been
photographed with a letter and number designation, Wages decided
to take the evidence with him.  Thereafter, he picked up the L-1,
L-2 and L-3 bullets, marked the location where the bullet had
been with a wire flag or a piece of wire, placed the bullets in a
plastic bag, labeled them and then took them with him.  At about
6:00, he returned to the Y, replaced the bullets, and had Kelly
Kramer, the photographer, take a picture of the bullets with the
letter and number designation. [FN1738]<p>
      Towards the end of the direct examination, Howen asked
Wages a series of questions about how Howen learned the
circumstances surrounding how the L series photographs were
taken. Wages testified that he had first discussed this subject
with Howen about one week before the trial started, that Howen
had taken notes of this discussion and that Wages had reminded
Howen of this conversation during the weekend preceding Wages'
scheduled testimony. [FN1739]  Based on comments that defense
counsel made later that day, it appears that Howen had not
notified defense counsel about his prior knowledge until the
previous night when he had agreed to inform the court of this
knowledge. [FN1740]<p>
      On cross-examination, Wages admitted that he had not marked
the direction in which the bullet was pointing and, thus, he may
not have replaced it in exactly the same position.  In addition,
Wages testified that Rampton had called him sometime in early
January 1993 and inquired why the search times on the 302 that he
had prepared on the search and the search times on pertinent
documents did not agree concerning the time that the search
ended.  At that time, Wages explained to Rampton the
circumstances surrounding the taking of the photographs.[FN1741]<p>
<H4>f.  The Late Production of the Shooting Incident
Report and Supporting Materials and the October 26, 1993
Court Order</H4><p>
       The circumstances surrounding the late production of the
subpoenaed version of the shooting incident report and supporting
materials were discussed earlier in Section IV (M) of this report.
One of the newly produced  documents included a diagram of the
Weaver cabin prepared by HRT sniper Horiuchi which detailed the
second shot that Horiuchi took on August 22, 1992.  As a result
of this late disclosure, the court ordered Horiuchi to return for
additional cross examination and imposed sanctions on the
Government by requiring it to pay the court costs and attorneys
fees caused by the delay.  The adverse impact of this disclosure
was intensified by the fact that it followed the embarrassing
series of late disclosures by the government which have been
detailed in this section.<p>
     Almost four months after the jury returned its verdict,
Judge Lodge issued an order imposing a $1920 fine against the
FBI.  This fine represented the attorneys fees paid to defense
counsel when Horiuchi returned for cross examination.  In this
order, Judge Lodge criticized the FBI efforts to produce the
discoverable materials, including Jencks and Brady documents and
stated that one of the primary reasons that a continuance of the
February 2, 1993 trial date was necessary was because of the
failure of the government to produce certain critical items of
evidence such as the ballistics evidence and the weapons seized.
He then stated:<p>
In hindsight, it is clear that even prior to
this meeting, the Assistant United States
Attorneys Howen and Lindquist were receiving
less than full cooperation from the FBI and that
items of evidence were not being produced
timely. It later became clear that a pattern of
delay and lack of cooperation was manifesting
itself despite the efforts of the local
Assistant United States Attorneys.  Once the
items and information were received in the local
office of the United States Attorney, Howen and
Lindquist continually assured the court that
they were producing the materials for
the defense as quickly as arrangements could be
made. [FN1742]<p>
     Judge Lodge recounted the incidents when the Government had
been late in producing discoverable material during the Weaver
trial.  First, he noted that seven of the addenda to the
government's discovery response, which were filed on the eve of
trial and during the trial, contained FBI materials. [FN1743] Next,
the court discussed the late disclosure of the Calley notes, the
Neal interview, the package of photographs taken by the FBI and the circumstances
surrounding the taking of the L series photographs.
The final offending incident was the late production of the shooting
incident materials in response to the defense subpoena. [FN1744]<p>
     After discussing the importance of discovery to the rights
of the defendant and the obligation of the government to produce
such materials, including Brady materials, as quickly as
possible, the court stated:<p>
Here, the FBI failed to produce materials in
a timely fashion.  They failed to provide Jencks
and Brady materials.  They failed to obey orders
and admonitions of this court. Their failures
necessitated the initial continuance of the
trial of this matter.  Once the matter had
begun, their continued failures necessitated
continuous discussion between court and counsel
and continuous prodding of the FBI by the court.
The culmination of this was the late receipt of
the Horiuchi materials.....<p> The failure to provide the Horiuchi materials was
the latest transgression in a series of transgressions.  This
failure occurred on day 33 of a trial at which the government
presented evidence at total of 37 days.  At the time of the
Horiuchi material incident, it was unclear how much longer the
government would be presenting its case.  The court was
concerned with the length of trial for a host of reasons, not
the least of which was the fact the court was the only active
judge in the district, responsible for matters in Coeur d'Alene,
Moscow, and Pocatello, Idaho, and all administrative matters in
the district.  In this light, the FBI's recalcitrance was
especially frustrating.  The court had an obligation to the
defendants to ensure they had all the materials to which they
were entitled and  an obligation to the federal litigants in
the District of Idaho to keep the calendar moving.  The actions
of the FBI impeded the court in both of these areas.  With no
idea as to how much information was yet to be divulged by the FBI,
and no idea how much longer the government's case in chief would
take, the failure to produce the Horiuchi materials forced the
court's action.  Previous orders and admonitions had proved to
be of no value. Accordingly, the court had no option but to
impose a sanction both as punishment for ignoring previous orders
and to secure compliance and cooperation during the
remainder of the trial. [FN1745]<p>
     Thereafter, the court concluded that the FBI had failed to
comply with its discovery obligations under Rule 16 and found the
FBI to be in contempt of court in violation of 18 U.S.C.  401.
In support of its ruling, the court held:<p>
   The FBI was a principal participant in the Weaver/Harris
criminal proceeding. Its behavior served to obstruct the
administration of justice in that proceeding.  Its behavior
brought about the delays and countless arguments outside the
presence of the jury.  These delays and arguments, which
obstructed the progress of the trial, would not have been
necessary had the FBI acted as it had been directed to
act.  The failure to act occurred in the courtroom where the
government, through its agent, was directed
to act.  All performance by these government agents revolved
around this court and this trial. All work performed by the
[sic] these agents  directly impacted these defendants.  The
actions of the government, acting through the FBI, evidence a
callous disregard for the rights of the defendants and the
interests of justice and demonstrate a complete lack of respect
for the order and directions of this court. [FN1746]<p>
 <H3>3.  Discussion</H3><p>
<H4>a. Response of the Government to the Defense
Subpoena for FBI and Marshals Service Manuals and
Personnel Files</H4><p>
    Issues were raised during our investigation as to whether
the government responded  appropriately  to the defense subpoenas
seeking the production of the FBI and Marshals Service manuals
and certain personnel files.  With regard to the response of the
government to the production of the manuals, we find their
efforts to be acceptable.  The Marshals Service produced these
materials immediately to the USAO when the issue first arose.
Although the FBI did not produce their manual provisions until
later, their response time does not seem unreasonable to us
considering the contemporaneous efforts of Howen to
resist production by the filing of a protective order.<p>
    We are somewhat troubled, however, by the response of Howen
in November 1992 to the request of defense counsel Peterson for
the FBI manual. Although not worded exactly the same as the
request in the subpoena, Peterson was clearly asking for the same
FBI manual provisions in November.  At that time, Howen declined
to produce these items for one or two reasons--either the
provisions were not in his possession or they were not
discoverable.  We think that the manual provisions were clearly
discoverable.  The actions of the FBI sniper on August 22, 1992
were pertinent to the charges lodged against Weaver and Harris.<p>
    With regard to the explanation that Howen did not have
possession of the materials and, thus, could not be expected to
produce them in discovery, we find such an excuse to be
unpersuasive and without legal merit.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim
P. 16 (a) (1) (C), the government is obligated to produce upon
request discoverable materials that "are within the possession,
custody or control of the government."  This obligation is not
limited to the materials within the possession of the prosecutor
but rather, extends to all materials over which the prosecutor
has knowledge and access.  See United States v. Bryan, 868 F. 2d
1032, 1036 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858 (1989).   A
prosecutor is "deemed to have knowledge of and access to anything
in the possession, custody or control of any federal agency
participating in the same investigation of the defendant."  Id.
To conclude otherwise would "unfairly allow the prosecution
access to documents without making them available to the
defense."  United States v. Robertson, 634 F. Supp. 1020, 1025
(E.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd, 815 F. 2d 714 (9th Cir.),  cert. denied,
484 U.S. 912 (1987).<p>
    Howen, as the prosecutor in the case, was responsible for
coordinating the government's response to its discovery
obligations.  The fact that Howen did not have physical possession
of an item did not erase his responsibility to produce clearly
discoverable material.  Hiding behind such an excuse is contrary
to the legal obligation of the Government, does a disservice to
the court and the defense and reflects adversely on the
Government. [FN1747]<p>
   Turning to the response of the government to the defense
subpoena for the personnel files, we note at the outset that the
court expressed concern over the manner in which the FBI
responded to the subpoena
for the Horiuchi personnel file but made no mention of the
response of the Marshals Service to a similar subpoena for the
personnel files of the marshals at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992.
As framed, the subpoenas requested the complete personnel files
of the named individuals.  We find that the protective order
sought by the government was solidly based in the law.  Indeed,
the court ultimately concluded that a Henthorn review rather than
production of the entire personnel file was an adequate response
to the request.  With regard to the speed with which the FBI
responded to the request, we cannot fault their actions.  There
was a legitimate basis to support their refusal to produce the
complete personnel file.  Once they were instructed to complete a
Henthorn review, they did so expeditiously in several days.  We
do not understand, however, why it took the USAO eleven days to
produce these certifications to the defense.  Thus, to the extent
that this production can be considered to have been untimely, the
USAO must accept partial responsibility.<p>
    One final matter deserves comment.  In its order, the court
criticized the government for not disclosing the defense that the
personnel files did not contain exculpatory information.  The
court seemed to suggest that the government had the obligation to
conduct the Henthorn review without a prior defense request.
While we appreciate the rationale of the court's ruling and
accept its conclusion, we think that the law is not sufficiently
clear on this point to justify criticizing the government.
Although we concur that the defense is entitled to receive Brady
material without a specific request, we are not comfortable in
concluding that the government, without a specific request for
the personnel files, must provide a Henthorn certification to
demonstrate that the examination has been done.<p>
<H4>b.  Failure to Disclose Financial Compensation
Arrangement with Informant Fadeley</H4><p>
    There can be no doubt that the defense was entitled to have
been informed that Fadeley might receive an award for his work on
the Weaver case.  Although we find the government responsible for
this failure to provide critical information to the defense, we
do not believe that the omission was improperly motivated.
Notwithstanding this conclusion, we are seriously concerned that
BATF Agent Byerly failed to inform Howen of this potential award
and, to a lesser extent, that Howen failed to be more aggressive
in attempting to ascertain if other compensation arrangements
existed.<p>
    With regard to the role of Howen in this incident,it is our
sense that he did not probe as deeply as he
should have into the financial promises or representations that
Byerly made to Fadeley.  Once he learned that Fadeley had been
paid expenses but no salary, Howen rested his inquiry.  Although
Howen had no prior knowledge of BATF having such an awards
policy, we think that a prudent prosecutor would have pursued the
subject further.  Indeed, as a prosecutor who had a healthy
discomfort with using informants
and an appreciation for the attacks that the defense can wage
against questionable compensation arrangements, we would have
expected Howen to have been more thorough in his efforts to
ferret out this information.<p>
    However, in fairness to Howen, this request for information
came on the eve of trial, at a time when he was frantically
preparing for opening statements as well as attending to other
critical trial preparation tasks.  It is for this reason and
others that we assess the primary responsibility for this
incident on Byerly.  We have difficulty understanding the reasons
why Byerly was not more forthcoming with this information.  All
indications that we have received was that Byerly had always been
an extremely cooperative and helpful member of the prosecution team.
As an experienced agent who had used informants on prior occasions,
we are confident that he appreciated the common pitfalls attendant
to the use of informants with one of the most notable being the
compensation arrangement.  That Fadeley had received an award in
the past and that he had been told that he
might receive an award in the future for the assistance that he
provided in the Weaver case was significant information that
Byerly should have conveyed to Howen.  However, Byerly failed to
do so.  We find it to have been unreasonable for Byerly to have
withheld this information when Howen failed to pose an exact
question to elicit it. Rather, we would have expected Byerly, as
a member of the team, to have volunteered it.  Similarly, we have
not persuaded by Byerly's argument that he assumed that Howen had
learned of the award during his meetings with Fadeley.  For Byerly
to have relied on such an assumption was neither reasonable not
prudent.  Indeed, in our view, Byerly should have raised this
important subject with Howen to ensure that his assumption of
knowledge was correct.<p>
    The late disclosure of the Fadeley compensation arrangement
was extremely embarrassing to the government and provided one of
the early suggestions that the government was not being totally
forthcoming with the information that it was providing to the
defendants.  Apart from the problems associated with the late
disclosure of the Fadeley information, we are troubled by the
award system which appers to be in place at BATF.  We are
concerned, as were the members of the USAO,[FN1748] that such an
award of future compensation comes dangerously close to being a
contingent fee arrangement.  It would seem difficult to honestly
believe that an informant who knew that he might be eligible for
such an award would not think that the government would be
anxious and pleased to receive information that would lead to the
successful prosecution of a defendant.  Even if knowledge of such
an award would not cause an informant to tell a blatant untruth,
it might affect his testimony in a manner adverse to a defendant.
In addition to the impact that such an award might have on the
truthfulness of an informant is the concern that such an
arrangement between the government and an informant has the
appearance of a contingent fee arrangement and casts the
government in a negative light.  It is for these reasons that we
urge the BATF to reconsider continuing its practice of giving
future awards to informants whom it has used.<p>
<H4>c.  Late Production of the Calley Notes</H4><p>
    Five weeks into the trial and after the testimony of Deputy
Marshal Cooper, Special Agent Calley found notes in his desk that
he had taken during his interview of Cooper as well as part of
his draft FD-302 of the interview.  The USAO had specifically
requested the FBI on September 3, 1993 to produce these notes,
yet they did not do so.  Responsibility for this incident must
rest with the FBI.<p>
    We do not think that Calley intentionally withheld or
concealed the notes.  From all accounts, Calley was surprised,
embarrassed and apologetic about the incident.  Rather, we find
that the incident was attributable to carelessness on his part
and perhaps to a failure of the case agents to carefully inspect
the materials that were being produced to the USAO in discovery.
all documents associated with the interviews of the marshals
present at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992 were critical to both
the prosecution and the defense.  Indeed, such documents were
among those that both sides were most anxious to review.  Thus,
we would have expected the FBI to have been more thorough in its
examination of these materials before it produced them.  Indeed,
had the FBI reviewed the documents more closely, it would have
noticed that the set of notes produced for Calley was incomplete.
[FN1749] Similarly, we are somewhat perplexed why this file was not
discovered during the initial search for responsible documents.
One would think that the desk of the agent responsible for
conducting the interview of Cooper would have been one of the
first locations that would have been searched.<p>
<H4>d.  Late Disclosure of the Neal Interview</H4><p>
    Under the rule articulated by the Supreme Court in Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the prosecution has an affirmative
duty to disclose to the defense evidence that is both favorable
to the accused and material to either guilt or punishment.
Failure to make disclosure of such evidence violates the due
process rights of the defendant "irrespective of the good faith
or bad faith of the prosecution."  Id. at 87.  The prosecution
has the constitutional obligation to disclose such information
even in the absence of a specified request from the defense.  See
United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976).
The prosecutor is only required to disclose materially
favorable evidence.  Evidence favorable to the accused is
evidence which, if disclosed and used effectively, may make the
difference between conviction and acquittal.  United States v.
Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985), citing, Brady v. Maryland, 373
U.S. 83 87 (1963) and Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269
(1959).  Evidence is material only if there is a "reasonable
probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,
the result of the proceeding would have been different."  United
States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.  A reasonable probability" is
a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.
Id.  See also Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39 (1987).  For
example, evidence which supports an affirmative defense or
corroborates the defendant's testimony is materially favorable
evidence which must be disclosed.  United States v. Hibler, 463
F. 2d 455, 459-60 (9th Cir. 1972).<p>
    The prosecutor is not obligated to disclose all information
in his case file which might be helpful to the defense, United
States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. at 109-11, nor is he required to
disclose "every bit of information that might affect the jury's
decision."  United States v. Little, 753 F. 2d 1420, 1441 (9th
Cir. 1984).  The prosecutor has no duty to disclose evidence
which is neutral or inculpatory.  United States v. Bryan, 868 f.
2d 1032, 1037 (9th Cir. 1989).  However,  if a prosecutor fails
to disclose evidence that results in depriving a defendant of
his right to a fair trial, that prosecutor has breached his
"constitutional duty to disclose."  United States v. Agurs, 427
U.S. at 108.  It is for this reason that a "prudent
prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of
disclosure." Id.  See Also United States v. Miller, 529 F. 2d
1125, 1128 (9th Cir.),  cert. denied, 426 U.S. 924 (1976).<p>
    Applying these standards to the information that Howen
learned at the Neal interview, we must conclude that the
information was subject to disclosure as Brady material as well
as being a statement of Roderick that should have been produced
as Jencks material.  One of the critical issues in the case was
who fired the first shot at Ruby Ridge.  To the extent that Howen
had any knowledge or information about this issue, he was
constitutionally obligated to produce it to the defense.  We deem
the substance of his April 24 interview with Captain Neal to
constitute such information.  Although Neal did not state that
Roderick said that he had shot the dog first, Neal did state that
it was his impression that Roderick had shot the dog first.
Regardless of whether Neal could articulate his reasons for
forming this impression, that he had this impression was
important information that needed to be disclosed to the defense
to permit them the opportunity to pursue the matter with Neal.<p>
    We believe that Howen recognized his obligation to disclose
this information from the moment that he first heard it.  Indeed,
he remarked to Neal at the interview that this information would
have to be given to the defense.  In addition, Lindquist recalled
Howan consulting with him about the matter shortly after the
interview.  At that time, Lindquist opined to Howen that the
information should be treated as Brady material and produced to
the defense.  Lindquist recalled Howen agreeing and that he just
wanted to receive confirmation from Lindquist.<p>
    Howen stated that he deferred disclosing this information to
the defense because he intended to call Neal as a witness and to
explore the issue with him on direct examination.  Howen believed
that through the direct questioning of Neal, he would
convincingly demonstrate that Roderick gave Neal no information
nor made any statements to him that would be evidence that
Roderick admitted to shooting the dog first.  We find this
justification unacceptable.  Although the Supreme Court has yet
to rule on the timing of when exculpatory evidence must be
produced, most courts require that Brady material must be
disclosed in time for effective use at trial. As the Ninth
Circuit held in United States v. Gordon, 844 F. 2d 1397, 1403
(1988), "Brady does not necessarily require that the prosecution
turn over exculpatory material before trial.   .    .   . 
[but] disclosure must be made at a time when disclosure would be
of value to the accused."  When exculpatory information is
disclosed at trial, a Brady violation only occurs if the
defendant was prejudiced by the delay in disclosure.  See United
States v. Aichele, 941 F. 2d  761, 764  (9th Cir. 1991).<p>
    It was not until the midst of Roderick's testimony--the
witness to whom this information was pertinent--that Howen made
disclosure to the defense.  When the court became aware of the
issue, it recessed the trial to permit the defense the
opportunity to question Neal.  In our view, this eleventh hour
disclosure by Howen comes perilously close to being a violation
of the Brady rule.  Although the defense had the opportunity to
examine Neal, this opportunity came in the midst of trial during
a hastily called recess.  This is not an instance when the
government had just acquired the information, indeed, Howen had
learned the information one month earlier.  Nor is it a defense
for Howen to argue that the defense could have interviewed Neal
since it knew that Neal was on the witness list of the
government.  Such an opportunity did not diminish the obligation
of Howen to make the disclosure of information which is "known to
the prosecution but unknown to the defense."  United States v.
Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103.<p>
    However, from a  strictly analytical perspective, the
defendants were probably not prejudiced from the action and,
thus, a Brady violation did not occur.  When this problem
surfaced, the court called a recess to give defense counsel an
opportunity to interview Neal.  Thereafter, they were able to
explore the issue with Neal and to use this information when
conducting their cross-examination of Roderick.  Furthermore,
based on the jury verdict returned on the assault on a federal
officer charges, it is difficult to conclude that the defendants
suffered prejudice from the late disclosure of this information.<p>
    Even if the defendants did not suffer any actual prejudice
by the delay in revealing the Neal interview, we find the conduct
of Howen raises serious ethical concerns.  Although there are no
internal Department of Justice guidelines governing the
appropriate time for disclosure of Brady materials, we believe
that the prompt disclosure of exculpatory information is the
better practice.  The American Bar Association had adopted such a
rule.  Standard 3-3.11 (a) of the ABA Standards for Criminal
Justice: The Prosecution Function (3d ed. 1992) provides that,<p>
A prosecutor should not intentionally fail to
make timely disclosure to the defense, at the
earliest feasible opportunity, of the
existence of all evidence or information which tends to
negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate
the offense charged or which would tend to
reduce the punishment of the accused.<p>
We think that the preferable course of action would have been for
Howen to have disclosed the Neal material--as he appears to have
originally intended--immediately after he first learned of it.
The late disclosure cast the government in a bad light and wasted
the court's time while the parties argued about whether the
rights of the defendants had been violated.<p>
    This conclusion leads us to our next area of inquiry, which
is whether the delayed disclosure of this information was an
effort by Howen to harm the ability of the defendants to prepare
their defense.  We found no evidence in our investigation that
Howan's decision was improperly motivated.  Although we may not
agree with his articulated strategy of clarifying the Neal
statements through direct testimony, we do not consider this
explanation as an after-the-fact fabrication.  We believe that
such reasoning was a major factor in the late disclosure.<p>
    However, we also believe that the stress of the trial,
coupled with long work hours with little sleep, impacted
adversely on the deteriorating psychological health of Howen and
contributed to his failure to disclose the Neal information as
well as the circumstances behind the taking of the L bullet
photographs.  Indeed, from the early stages of the trial, those
working closely with Howen noticed that he was under incredible
pressure and was exhibiting signs of stress.[FN1750]  According to
Lindquist, Howen was an excellent, methodical and thorough
prosecutor who was "burning the candle at both ends" during the
Weaver prosecution. [FN1751]  As the trial progressed, Howen was
eating poorly and was getting little or no sleep each night as he
worked on the numerous trial preparation tasks.  In addition, the
time away from his family caused "some significant family
problems" which increased the emotional pressure on
Howen.[FN1752] Although Lindquist tried to relieve some of the
pressure on Howen by assuming more responsibility, this strategy
did not cause Howen to slow down.[FN1753] Ellsworth spent
considerable time, especially during the latter stages of the
trial, trying to provide emotional support for Howen.  Ellsworth
noted that others in the USAO as well as the agents on the case
noticed the change in Howen and were concerned about his condition.
[FN1754] For example, Rampton noted that on a couple of occasions,
Howen woul stare in silence for extended periods of time.  He also
observed that some of Howen's legal arguments were not as coherent
as they had been previously.[FN1755] Towards the end of the trial,
the pressure on Howen became so intense that he could not proceed
and had to absent himself from the remaining days of the trial.
Thereafter, Lindquist performed the remaining prosecutorial
tasks.<p>
    One additional issue warrants mention and that concerns the
timing of the interview.  We are perplexed by the failure of
Howen to interview Neal and other CRT members sooner.  These CRT
members rescued the stranded marshals following the traumatic
events of August 21, 1992.  They were the first individuals to
have contact with the marshals.  Howen knew about the involvement
of the CRT members in the rescue and should have appreciated the
importance of any information or statements that the marshals may
have disclosed to them.  Nevertheless, no one from the USAO
interviewed the CRT members during the 7-1/2 month period before
the beginning of the trial.  We find this preparation lapse to be
troubling.  Although we appreciate that numerous demands were
being placed on the prosecution during the pretrial period, we
have difficulty understanding why hours were spent interviewing
prospective witnesses in Iowa who might have information to
support the conspiracy count, yet no time was spent interviewing
the CRT members who might possess information critical to the
government's theory of the case.<p>
<H4>e.  The L Bullet Photographs</H4><p>
 Several days after the controversial disclosure of the
Calley notes and the Neal interview, Howen was tasked with
informing the court of yet another serious omission by the
government.  As with the Neal interview, the responsibility for
failing to inform the court and defense counsel earlier about the
circumstances surrounding the taking of the L series photographs
[FN1756] must be assigned to Howen. Indeed, he admitted that he had
acquired this information during his pretrial interview with
Wages in early April, but simply forgot the information.  Howen
stated that when Wages first communicated this information to
him, he did not recognize it as "significant."  Because this
disclosure was clearly significant, we believe that when Wages
informed Howen in April 1993 of this information, that Howen
failed to focus on the implications of the information and
quickly forgot the problem once the trial was underway.  We do
not believe that Howen intentionally concealed his knowledge.
As with his failure to disclose the Neal interview, we believe
that the extreme stress he was under, coupled with his efforts
to handle numerous trial preparation activities contributed to
his memory lapse.[FN1757]<p>
        We do not believe that Howen intentionally withheld this
information from the court and defense counsel.  Nevertheless, we
are not entirely comfortable with the manner in which he informed
them that he had known of this information earlier.  The record
indicates that Howen informed the court and defense counsel on
May 25, 1993 about the circumstances surrounding the taking of
the L series photographs but that it was not until two days later
that Howen confessed to having had such knowledge
approximately six weeks earlier.  Based on his recollection in
his interview, Howen indicated that it was not until after he
disclosed the information that Wages reminded Howen that he had
provided this information to him in April 1993.  However, Wages
and Rampton recall this incident differently.  They recall
informing Howen of how the photographs were taken as well as
reminding him that they had informed him earlier on the same
occasion.  We find their account more credible.  Indeed, we find
it somewhat difficult to believe that after informing Howen of
the manner in which the photographs were taken and his
realization that he had a serious problem that he would not have
questioned why this information was not revealed at an earlier
time.  We think that Howen was reminded of his prior knowledge
during his conversation with Wages and Rampton.  We are troubled
by the failure of Howen to be totally forthcoming with the court
until later but attribute it to his impaired psychological state
at the time.<p>
    Although Rampton insists that he informed Howen and
Lindquist in January 1993 of the circumstances surrounding the
taking of the photographs, we are not convinced that this
communication, if made, was articulated as clearly as Rampton
recalls.  Neither Howen nor Lindquist recall Rampton informing
them of this information at that time.  Based on the unconcerned
reaction of Howen and Lindquist that Rampton describes, we
suspect that the conversation may have been focused on the
accusations of Spence that the bullet was planted by the FBI and
to the extent that any information was relayed regarding the
method by which the photographs were taken, it was secondary to
the primary subject of the conversation.  In addition, there are
two other reasons why we discount this part of Rampton's
recollection.  First, he stated that he provided defense counsel
Peterson with the same information regarding the L series
photographs.  However, there is no indication that Peterson knew
of this information.  Indeed, if Peterson had been aware of such
facts, we would have expected him to have disclosed the
information to fellow defense counsel and for all of them to have
protested the action.[FN1758] None of this ever happened.  Second,
Rampton created no record of his conversations with Howen,
Lindquist and Peterson on this subject.  As it is the practice of
the FBI agents to faithfully document their significant
contacts in an investigation, we find it unusual that
the practice was not followed here. [FN1759]<p>
    Our final comments on this issue are directed at the late
disclosure of the set of photographs that contained pictures of
the L bullet before Wages had removed it.  Howen and Lindquist
thought that the late discovery of these photographs was
attributable to the relocation of evidence that occurred during
the pretrial phase of the case and that these photographs were
misplaced.[FN1760] The evidence supports this explanation for the
untimely production of these photographs.  There was no evidence
found indicating that anyone from the government intentionally
concealed these pictures.  It is unclear to whom responsibility
for this oversight should be assigned.  One would have hoped and
expected that the USAO would have carefully maintained a record
of materials submitted by the FBI to the USAO.  However, this did
not appear to have occurred.  An October 28, 1992 letter from
Dillon to Ellsworth indicates that the FBI forwarded these
photographs to the USAO at that time.[FN1761] However, a review of
the addenda to the government's response to the discovery
stipulation indicates that these photographs were never produced.
Despite the existence of this transmittal letter, Howen was
unwilling to admit that the photographs were never produced.
Despite the existence of this transmittal letter, Howen was
unwilling to admit that the photographs had been sent to his
office since he had experienced a problem in the past with the
FBI stating in a letter that they had sent an item, but then
discovering the item was missing.  However, when questioned why
his office did not verify that the enclosed items had been
provided, Howen admitted that at the time, he did not have a
procedure whereby he or an assistant would review a package and
then notify the FBI of any missing items. [FN1762] We think that
the USAO must accept responsibility for this oversight.<p>
    Lindquist believed that the prosecution was harmed by the
manner in which the FBI agents had picked up evidence and then
later returned, replaced and photographed it.  He viewed such
conduct as very troubling and contrary to established procedures
for processing evidence.  Lindquist believed that the testimony
that revealed the circumstances surrounding the taking of these
photographs was harmful because it caused the jurors to question
the basic credibility of the FBI since the agents had proceeded
in such a fashion.[FN1763]  Such doubts tainted the integrity of
the government prosecution.[FN1764]  We agree with Lindquist that
this incident had a significant negative impact.<p>
 <H3>4. Conclusion</H3><p>
    The late disclosures by the government of important
information during the Weaver trial were unnecessary, were
embarrassing and damaged the integrity of the government.[FN1765]
As was previously discussed in section IV (M) of our report, the
late production of materials related to the shooting incident
report were particularly devastating to the prosecution.  The FBI
is responsible for that incident.  We hope that corrective
procedures are instituted to prevent a similar occurrence in the
future.  The FBI is also responsible for the late production of
the Calley notes.  Although we do not view that incident as
having been intentional, we think that if more care and attention
had been directed to the original search and production of the
materials, it would have been avoided.<p>
    The FBI was not singularly responsible for the late
disclosure of information--the USAO also neglected to reveal
information in a timely fashion.  Although the predominant blame
for the late disclosure of the information pertinent to the
Fadeley compensation arrangement rests with BATF Agent Byerly, we
find that Howen should have been more aggressive in discovering
this crucial information.  The failure to reveal the Neal
interview and the circumstances surrounding the taking of the L
series photographs were also extremely damaging to the
credibility of the government.  Both incidents were avoidable;
both incidents were the fault of Howen.  Although we do not find
evidence of improper motivation, we remain concerned by the lack
of timeliness of disclosures, and faulty judgment in assessing
the importance of these issues.<p><hr><p> Released through<p> COUNSEL CONNECT<p>

     1611 This review has its origins in the case of United
States v. Henthorn, 931 F. 2d 29 (9th Cir. 1991),
cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1588 (1992).  In that case, the Ninth
Circuit reaffirmed its holding in United States v. Cadet, 727 F.
2d 1453, 1467 (1984) that once the defendant has made a discovery
request for the personnel files of law enforcement witnesses, the
government has the "duty" to review these personnel files to
determine if they contain material information that is favorable
to the defendant.  If the prosecutor is uncertain whether any
information is material, he can submit the matter to the court
for in camera review.  The personnel files do not need to be
produced "to the defendant or the court unless they contain
information that is or may be material to the defendant's case."
United States v. Henthorn, 931 F. 2d at 31; accord, United States
v. Dominguez-Villa, 954 F. 2d 562, 565 (9th Cir. 1992); United
States v. Cadet, 727 F. 2d at 1463.  The review of the personnel
files need not be done by the federal prosecutor responsible for
the case.  It is sufficient if an appropriate agency attorney or a
member of his staff conduct the review and then notify the
prosecutor of the results of the review.  The prosecutor is then
responsible for determining if the information is potentially
Brady material and if so, whether it should be produced or
submitted to the court for in camera review.  See United States
v. Jennings, 960 F. 2d 1488, 1492, n. 3 (9th Cir. 1992).<p>

     1617 The CLU I had instructed the Salt Lake Division to
process the subpoena at the field office level and to coordinate
their response with the USAO.  Thereafter, the Salt Lake City
Division collected and produced the manual provisions to the
defense without first submitting the manual provisions for review
by the field office documents examiner who was responsible for
reviewing the materials to insure that the disclosure was within
the bounds of the request and that no applicable privileges were
compromised.  According to Clawson, the disclosure included
sensitive materials that were not within the scope of the request
which upset Gale Evans, the Unit Chief of the Violent Crimes Unit
of the Criminal Investigation Division.  See FD-302 Interview of

     1650  Interestingly, this award was given to Fadeley for his
assistance in the investigation of Frank Kumnick, who was
associated withy members of the Aryan Nations and who was
associated with members of the Aryan Nations and who was an
associate of Weaver.  See discussion in Section IV (A).  Sometime
in 1987 or 1988, Kumnick sold an illegal weapon to Fadeley in his
undercover role.  At that time, BATF knew that Kumnick and his
associates had discussed forming a third group of white
separatists.  In addition, Fadeley learned that Kumnick had
discussed kidnapping and holding for ransom children attending a
private school in Northern Idaho.  BATF requested Howen to
informally decline prosecuting Kumnick for the gun charge because
they believed that such a prosecution would expose Fadeley and
that it would be more beneficial to the BATF investigation if
Fadeley remained in his undercover capacity.  Howen agreed and
informally declined to prosecute Kumnick.  See Letter from Ronald
Howen to Barbara Berman, January 31, 1994, at 1-2.<p>

     1666  The numerous errors in the FD-302 of Cooper created
major problems for the prosecutor in presenting his case at
trial.  Similar problems were created by inaccuracies in the
FD-302 of Ruth Rau.  These inaccuracies, which in turn, created
conflicts between the alleged statement made in the interview and
the testimony elicited at trial, provided support for the defense
attack on the credibility of the witness.  The current FBI
practice is to have the interviewing agent prepare an interview
report based on his notes and recollection.  We think that such a
procedure can never be totally accurate and, indeed, in some
situations, major errors can be made.  Howen suggested, and we
agree, that a more satisfactory way to conduct these interviews
would be to record them on tape and to have the tape be the
interview record.<p>

    1747  It was not until our interview of former U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth that he became aware of the position of Howen on this
issue.  Ellsworth agreed that the attorney representing the
government has the obligation to obtain discoverable documents
that he knows exist and that are in the possession of another
government agency.  Ellsworth Interview, Tape 5, at 47-48.<p>
    1748  Ellsworth said that he has always found payments
confidential to informants to be a troubling area.  He had
particular difficulty with an award made after the informant had
finished working on a matter because he could understand how the
informant might feel that the size of the award was affected by
the outcome in the case, even if it were not the basis upon which
the BATF made the award.  Ellsworth interview, Tape 1, at 28-29.
Howen opined that the future award program at BATF creates a real
problem for prosecutors.  Although Howen believed that paying an
informant a salary also presents issues as to the credibility of
an informant, such a procedure, when disclosed at the outset, can
be dealt with more easily than the future award program.  Howen
Interview, Tape 2, at 27-31,  34-35.<p>
    1749  Although we do not assess responsibility for this
incident on the USAO, we cannot help but wonder if this omission
in the Calley notes may have been something that they should have
detected.  Cooper was a critical witness and the first witness
for the government.  We would have thought that as part of the
preparation process, someone in the USAO would have reviewed the
Calley materials, would have noticed that pages were missing and
that this would have prompted a further inquiry.<p>

    1756  An evaluation of the conduct of the FBI in removing,

discussed in Section IV (I) of the report.<p>
    1757  Lindquist said that he was troubled by the failure
of Howen to remember to disclose this information to the court
and the defense.  However, he did not attribute this action to
any improper motive on the part of Howen.  Indeed, Lindquist
noted that such an omission was "uncharacteristic of Ron", whom
he regarded as being "extremely diligent" in discovery matters.
Lindquist attributed the lapse to "the fact that [Howen] was
burning the candle at both ends and was very weighted down by
horrendous discovery demands and it simply slipped his mind."
Lindquist Interview, Tape 3, at 32.<p>
    1758  Lindquist said that if he had known that the defense
had been informed in January 1993 of the circumstances
surrounding the taking of the L photographs, they certainly would
have raised such knowledge in defense when defense counsel
complained about the problem in May, 1993.  Lindquist Interview,
Tape 3, at 28-29.<p>
    1759  Lindquist would have expected the FBI agents involved
to have documented their conversations with defense counsel on
this issue and the fact that they did not do so was troubling to
him.  Lindquist Interview, Tape 3, at 33.<p>
    1760  Howen Interview, Tape 6, at 34-37.  Lindquist thought
that the photographs may have been misplaced when some boxes were
taken from the main storage area at the FBI and transferred to be
inventoried at a condominium used by the marshals.  Lindquist
Interview, Tape 5, at 39-40.<p>
    1761  See Letter from T. Michael Dillon to Maurice
Ellsworth, October 28, 1992.  In this letter, Dillon forwarded a
package of materials, including a package of 107 photographs and
a package of 22 photographs, both of which were taken by Cyrus
Grover.  The photographs produced by Howen on May 25, 1993 were
similarly described.<p>

<TITLE>The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE>Released through<p>  COUNSEL CONNECT<p>
COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service 
for attorneys. Counsel Connect is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><p>
<H3>V. RECOMMENDATIONS</H3><p>
     Law enforcement officials confronted fundamental and recurring
problems of crisis management at Ruby Ridge.  Recently, the
Department of Justice completed an exhaustive review of the
government's response to the crisis at Waco, Texas.  The review
included recommendations for managing barricade/hostage situations,
coordinating law enforcement efforts, and dealing with persons
whose motives and beliefs are unconventional.<p>
     Our recommendations expand on some of the ideas expressed in
the Waco report, and, because each crisis presents its own
particular difficulties, we offer recommendations emanating from
the Ruby Ridge situation.<p>
1.   The Policy for the Use of Deadly Force and the
Authorization Structure for Rules of Engagement
Must be Standardized for All Federal Law
Enforcement Agencies.<p>
We believe that all federal law enforcement officers should be
governed by a standard deadly force policy.  Thus, we recommend
that the Department of Justice establish a universal policy on the
use of deadly force to govern the law enforcement components within
the Department and to serve as a model for other agencies.<p>
We have concluded that the special Rules of Engagement in
force at Ruby Ridge violated the Constitution of the United States. 
We also found that the poorly drafted and ambiguous rules created
confusion among those who were obliged to make instantaneous, life
and death decisions while attempting to obey the requirements of
the rules.  In hostage/barricade situations, law enforcement
officers need a clear definition of the conditions under which
deadly force may be employed.  It is critical that law enforcement
personnel have a common and clear understanding of the rules
governing their conduct.  Moreover, when special rules of
engagement are necessary, established review and authorization
procedures must be in place.<p>
Recently, the Department of Justice established the Office of
Investigative Agency Policy, headed initially by the Director of
the FBI.  We suggest that Office may be best equipped to develop a
standardized policy on the use of deadly force and to formulate
procedures for formulating and authorizing special rules as needed.<p>
2.   Crisis Response Teams Need to be Created<p>
As the authors of the Waco Report observed, it is imperative
that specially trained crisis managers, familiar with relevant
tactical, behavioral, and scientific disciplines, be available to
respond to crises.  FBI special agents in charge of particular
geographical areas are not necessarily the best qualified
individuals to supervise the government's response to crisis
situations.  We recommend that specially trained crisis managers
should be deployed for that purpose.  Expertise, not geography,
should control.  The recent consolidation of the FBI negotiations
and tactical operations, as recommended in the Waco Report, will
have an impact on the role both disciplines play in resolving
crises.<p>
We enthusiastically endorse the recent proposal by the
Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of the Department of Justice
that the FBI Crisis Response Team include specially trained
prosecutors to provide legal support to tactical teams. 
Substantial difficulties confront prosecutors preparing a criminal
case after a violent standoff between suspects and law enforcement. 
Law enforcement agents in such situations need to be mindful that
a successful prosecution is one of the objectives of a favorable
resolution of the crisis.  The presence of prosecutors at crisis
sites can contribute significantly to the ultimate success of the
law enforcement effort within the criminal justice system.<p>
Frequently, as at Ruby Ridge, the local FBI and local SWAT
teams arrive at the scene before the HRT.  Therefore, we propose
periodic joint training exercises by enhanced Crisis Response
Teams, HRT, FBI SWAT teams and other federal and local law
enforcement agencies.  Such cross-training, as discussed in detail
in the Waco Report, would have a number of benefits, including
greater knowledge and appreciation of the contributions of each
element of the response team.<p>
3.   A Multi-Agency Review with DOJ Representation
Should be Established to Review Shooting Incident
Reports<p>
We found that the FBI review of the shooting incident at Ruby
Ridge was not sufficiently thorough or accurate.  We recommend that
all internal reviews of shooting incidents by federal agencies be
scrutinized by a board of representatives of law enforcement
agencies prior to the close of the internal review process.  The
board should include at least one DOJ attorney with special
expertise in this area.<p>
The board could adopt the agency's findings and
recommendations, return the report for additional inquiry, or refer
the report to the appropriate component of the Department of
Justice.  The board would also be responsible for weighing
recommendations made by the agency review team.<p>
Such a process would encourage a higher quality of internal
review throughout federal law enforcement agencies as well as
increase public confidence in the review process.<p>
4.   Coordination Must Be Improved Between the FBI and
Prosecutors in Regard to Discovery<p>
Significant problems in the Ruby Ridge prosecution arose in
the discovery process.  The FBI delayed giving prosecutors the
documents they needed for trial preparation and to provide to the
defense in discovery.  The delayed production of these documents to
the defense occurred, in part, because of disputes between the FBI
and the prosecutors about the material that was required to be
produced.  The delay in the production of the FBI Shooting Incident
Report exemplifies this problem.<p>
We recommend that the Department of Justice mandate that the
FBI release to prosecutors Shooting Incident Reports and supporting
documentation when a confrontation has resulted in death or serious
injury.  Moreover, the FBI should denominate a unit within the
Bureau to coordinate and monitor discovery in a timely and thorough
manner.  Finally, the Department of Justice should establish
guidelines governing the production of FBI material.<p>
5.   Coordination Among the FBI Crime Scene
Investigation Team, the FBI Laboratory, and the
Prosecutors Must Be Improved<p>
Our report is critical of the crime scene investigation at
Ruby Ridge.  Because an experienced evidence response team was not
used to recover and preserve evidence, the quality of the search
and the resulting evidentiary analyses were compromised.  To
increase the chances of a successful prosecution, FBI Headquarters
should mandate that its evidence response team be used in
situations like Ruby Ridge to conduct systematic and thorough crime
scene investigations.<p>
The FBI Laboratory has for years been under conflicting
pressures to perform analyses quickly for many different cases. 
Nonetheless, we believe that the problems that our inquiry has
disclosed could have been avoided.  The FBI Laboratory should not
key its analyses to the trial date.  Prosecutors need laboratory
analyses to develop a theory of their case, and analyses often
suggest that additional examinations should be performed.  We also
recommend that the FBI assign an agent familiar with the theory of
the case, the evidence, anticipated defenses, and FBI forensic
capabilities to coordinate the prosecution's interaction with the
Laboratory.  In complex cases, this role may be exclusive of other
responsibilities.<p>
We also recommend that the FBI reevaluate its policy on
memorializing witness interviews.  We found inaccuracies in FD-302
interview reports of critical trail witnesses, which undermined
their credibility at trial.  The FBI needs to give
consideration to other methods available that would more accurately
memorialize witness interviews.<p>
6.   U.S. Attorneys' Offices Should Establish A Formal
Indictment Review Process<p>
The indictment drafted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen was
reviewed and approved solely by U.S. Attorney Ellsworth.  A number
of defects in the indictment went undetected.  We believe that
significant indictments should be more carefully scrutinized.<p>
We recommend that significant indictments be formally reviewed
by a committee of Assistant U.S. Attorneys within a particular
office, who have been thoroughly briefed on the theory of the case,
the evidence, and anticipated defenses or problems.  We do not
suggest that such a process would resolve every factual or legal
difficulty.  However, it would encourage a more rigorous analysis
of the relevant conduct and would probably ensure more appropriate
charges.<p>
7.   Other Recommendations<p>
We recommend that our analysis of the conduct of Assistant
U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen be referred to the Executive Office for
United States Attorneys for whatever action it deems appropriate.<p>
Finally, we recommend that our findings concerning the events
surrounding the shooting of Vicki Weaver by the FBI sniper/observer
on August 22, 1992 and the Rules of Engagement under which he
operated be referred to the appropriate component of the Department
of Justice for an assessment of its prosecutive merit. <p><hr><p>

Beauregard, Louisiana on developments in the Weaver case. The
decision is made to send SOG team to Idaho to gather information
to develop plan to arrest Weaver. June 17-24, 1991 SOG
reconnaissance team travels to Northeastern Idaho and conducts
assessment of the Weaver case. The team develops a plan for the
safe arrest of Weaver on his property and away from his wife and
children. Plan describes Weaver as "extremely dangerous and
suicidal."     <p>
July 9, 1991 <p>
     Deputy Marshal Cluff and Weaver's

they are trespassing and the marshals leave without incident. <p>
March 27, 1992 <p>
     Acting Marshals Service Director Henry
Hudson was briefed on developments in the Weaver case. Hudson
asks U.S. Attorney Maurice Ellsworth to consider dismissing
warrant and reissuing it under seal. Ellsworth rejects the
proposal. Hudson directs that any plan to arrest Weaver must
eliminate possibility of harm to Vicki Weaver and the Weaver
children.Marshals Service Enforcement Division Branch Chief
Arthur Roderick is given primary responsibility for devising a
suitable plan to arrest Weaver. Three phase operation plan is
developed.April 2-12, 1992 During Phase I of their operation
plan, the marshals conduct surveillance of the Weaver property
and determine technical requirements for additional
surveillance. April 13, 1992 Acting Director Hudson approves
operation plan for Phase II, during which surveillance cameras
would be utilized to gather information about Weavers' daily
actions so that options could be developed for Phase III, the
actual arrest of Weaver. <p>
 April 17 through 1st week of May, 1992 <p>
     Marshals install surveillance cameras on ridges 
overlooking Weaver property and make three fact-finding trips

May 27, 1992 <p>
     Undercover plan developed by Marshals
Service after Acting Director Hudson rejects plans to forcibly
arrest Weaver using either "lethal" or "non-lethal" weapons. 
Undercover operation contemplates Marshal Service
surreptitiously buying a plot of land north of the Weaver
property and that two deputy marshals, posing as husband and
wife, would visit and develop the property, and that eventually
an opportunity would arise to arrest Weaver out of the presence
of other family members. Plan put on hold pending Hudson's
confirmation as Director by U.S. Senate. <p>

     Deputy Marshals Roderick, Cooper, Degan, and
Hunt, along with local marshal and deputy sheriffs use firing
range west of Spokane, Washington to test their weapons as
required by internal Marshals Service practice. <p>
Friday, August 21, 1992. <p>

the reconnaissance ("Recon") team (Roderick, Cooper and Degan)
proceeds up the trail from "Y" toward the Weaver compound. <p>
Friday, August 21, 1992 <p>
     At 9:00 a.m. the Recon team joins the OP team at the 
observation post above the Weaver compound to discuss their 
observations. The Recon team proceeds to area 200-250 yards from
the Weaver cabin were Roderick tosses rocks in the direction of 
the Weaver compound. The Recon team moves to garden/spring house 
area below the Weaver cabin. <p>
     At 10:00 a.m., while Recon team gets ready to leave 
garden/spring house area, Norris, at the observation post, radios 
that a vehicle is approaching and that the Weavers are responding. 
Recon team retreats through the woods toward the fern field
while pursued by Kevin Harris and the Weaver dog, Striker. As
the Recon team passes the fern field proceeding towards the "Y",
Sammy Weaver is seen with Harris and the dog in pursuit.<p>

in defensive positions.<p>
     At 1:30 p.m., in Washington, D.C., Marshals Service 
Director Hudson and other Marshals Service officials meet with 
FBI Associate Deputy Director Douglas Gow and FBI Assistant 
Director Larry Potts to discuss the response to the shooting 
and the marshals predicament on Ruby Ridge. <p>
     In the late afternoon, Assistant Director Potts 
orders the FBI Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT") deployed. <p>
     At 6:30 p.m., HRT Commander Richard Rogers and
the advance team of HRT personnel depart for Idaho accompanied
by Marshals Service Director of Operations Duke Smith. While en
route, Rogers has a series of conversations with Assistant
Director Potts and Deputy Assistant Director Coulson about

Glenn arrives at the command post at Ruby Ridge. Glenn assumes
overall responsibility for the FBI operations at Ruby Ridge.In
the afternoon, U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson notifies U.S.
Attorney Ellsworth of the shooting at Ruby Ridge. Ellsworth
sends Ron Howen to Ruby Ridge to act as the U.S. Attorney's
representative. Howen arrives at Ruby Ridge late in the
evening.<p>
Saturday, August 22, 1992 <p>
     At 1:00 a.m., Idaho State Police CRT arrives back 
at the command post and brings with it the three 
deputy marshals and the body of Deputy Marshal Degan.

Hospital for examination and then are taken back to their
condominium at Schweitzer Mountain, arriving at approximately
3:00 a.m. Sometime in the afternoon, FBI agents interview the
marshals involved in the August 21 incident. A criminal
complaint is filed charging Weaver and Harris with murder of
Deputy Marshal Degan in violation of 1: U.S.C.  111, 1111 and
1114.At 4:45 a.m., the HRT advance team arrives at (cut off...) <p>

materials. <p>

<center>
<table border=2><TR><TD><img width=450 height=73 border=0 src="header.gif" alt="James E. Tierney's Attorneys General Homepage"></TD></TR></Table>
</center><blockquote>

            <H2 align=center>THE BASICS: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H2>


<H3>What does the Attorney General do?</H3>

<P>     The attorney general is the state's chief law enforcement officer.  He
or she directs an office of prosecutors and investigators who represent the
state on virtually all legal matters. This includes responsibilities for
criminal prosecution, consumer protection, antitrust law, environmental
safety, child welfare, victims rights, gambling regulation and defending
the state when it gets sued.</P>

<H3>How are state attorneys general selected?</H3>

<P>     43 of the 50 state attorneys general are elected by the voters at the
ballot box.  All but one serves a four year term.  This makes the state
attorney general very different than the U.S. Attorney General who is
appointed by the President of the United States and serves as a member of
his cabinet.  The state attorney general generally believes that his or her
"client" is the "public interest" and not simply a state official or
agency.</P>
<H3>
What kinds of cases are handled by state attorneys general?</H3>

<P>     State attorneys general face the most difficult cases in our legal
system.  Is assisted suicide constitutional?  Should a child be separated
from his or her parent? Is a new state statute on abortion legal?</P>

<P>     Most of the cases handled by the office of a state attorney general,
however, never make it into the headlines.  Indeed, most cases involve
defending the state when it gets sued by individuals and businesses who are
unhappy with a state governmental decision.</P>

<P>     They also consist of routine enforcement actions against individuals
and businesses who violate the state's civil laws and regulations. 
Examples of these cases would include licensure violations by professionals
such as doctors, real estate brokers, etc. They also include violations of
environmental rules and banking, health and insurance regulations.</P>

<H3>Do the Governor and the Attorney General always get along?</H3>

<P>     In vast number of cases, the state's governor and its attorney general
cooperate very closely.  Both swear to uphold the same constitution and
laws and both are committed to the betterment of their state.  For that
reason, on a daily basis state attorneys general and their staffs give
legal advice to the governor and his or her administration.</P>

<P>     There are times, however, when serious disagreements occur. The best
current example occurred a few weeks ago in Mississippi where the governor
actually sued his attorney general in an attempt to stop the law suit filed
by the attorney general against the tobacco industry.</P>
<H3>
How is the state attorney general different from district attorneys?
</H3>  

<P>   With the exception of the states of Alaska, New Jersey, Delaware and
Rhode Island where the attorney general prosecutes virtually all serious
crime, the office of the District Attorney is primarily responsible for the
prosecution of all criminal activity. These local officials are usually
elected by county or district and serve as the first line in prosecuting
criminal activity ranging from simple traffic tickets to murder.</P>

<P>     State attorneys general often assist the District Attorneys in
criminal matters.</P>

<P>     *** Attorneys general do much of the appellate work that arises out of
local prosecutions.  (This is especially true in death penalty cases.)</P>

<H3>     Attorneys general generally also have the right to directly prosecute
cases:</H3>

<P>     *** where the District Attorney asks for additional assistance (often
in rural areas or where the alleged criminal activity is extremely
complex);</P>

<P>     *** where the District Attorney has a conflict of interest (A good
example of this is in Californian where the attorney general now has the
responsibility of investigating former L.A.P.D. Detective Mark Fhurman for
perjury in the O.J. Simpson case because the L.A. District Attorney has a
"conflict" arising from its reliance on Fhurman at the trial);</P>

<P>     *** where the Legislature has granted the attorney general direct
prosecutorial authority (Medicaid Fraud is an area where this has occurred.
 Cases arising out of statewide grand juries - often drug and political
corruption cases - also fall into this category).</P>

<H3>About what kinds of things would someone call the attorney general?</H3>

<P>     Citizens should feel free to call their state attorney general about
just about anything of a legal nature!  Even if the Office of Attorney
General is not the right place to handle the problem, they are very skilled
in referring citizens to the state agency that does have jurisdiction.</P>

<P>     Specifically, state attorneys general have always been very active in
protecting the rights of consumers when they feel they have been treated
unfairly.  This means that if a citizen feels "ripped off" by a fast
talking telemarketer or a door-to-door salesman or a slick and misleading
direct mail solicitation, then the state attorney general is the place to
start to see if something can be done.
  </P>

<H2><font color=0000FF>HIGHLIGHTS:</font></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he emergence of attorneys general in the area of public charities is
being driven by changes in the health industry but appears to be picking
up in other areas as well.  Tobacco cases continue to be filed with more
waiting in the wings. Texas Attorney General DAN MORALES is working with
his state's banks to stop money laundering, and Michigan Attorney
General FRANK KELLEY praises a sentence in a workplace manslaughter
case. Consumer cases were settled in several states as state and federal
cooperation continues at an all-time high, but action in antitrust and
health law was slow.  With the exception of a few states that hold
August and September primaries, even politics seems to have slipped into
the summer doldrums.</P>


<P><H2><font color=0000FF>TOBACCO WATCH:</font></H2></P>

<P>*** Connecticut: Attorney General RICHARD BLUMENTHAL became the tenth
attorney general to file a lawsuit against the tobacco industry to
recover Medicaid money spent by the state on smoking- related illnesses,
and to stop tobacco companies from marketing their products to people
under 18.</P>

<P>***  Virginia: Attorney General JIM GILMORE announced that Virginia will
not sue the tobacco industry, objecting to the theory of the cases and
noting that the tobacco industry is a "key ingredient of the state
economy."</P>

<P>*** The Minnesota Supreme court rejected the tobacco industry's
"subrogation defense" and upheld all but one count -- including the
potential applicability of the state's antitrust, consumer protection,
deceptive trade practices and false advertising laws -- of the suit
filed by Minnesota Attorney General HUBERT HUMPHREY, III and Minnesota
Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The decision allows the Attorney General and the
Blues to proceed "in the shoes" of all affected smokers in the state on
these theories.</P>

<P>*** The tobacco industry once again filed a preemptive suit to stop a
suit threatened by Utah Attorney General JAN GRAHAM. Utah Governor Mike
Levitt supports Graham's efforts in this state where smoking has long
been unpopular. The industry has filed similar preemptive suits in
several other states, but to date they have not been successful in
shifting the forum selected by the attorney general.</P>

<P>*** In Florida, court-ordered mediation over apparent tobacco litigation
included took place. The press reported that all principles, including
Governor Lawton Chiles and Attorney General BOB BUTTERWORTH, came to the
table. The substance of the discussions is under a protective order, but
outside the room a tobacco industry lawyer called the state's case
"politically correct extortion." He said the companies weren't going to
pay a dime.  Approximately 75 lawyers were seen entering the mediation
room, where smoking was banned by mutual consent.</P>

<P>*** In Texas, the tobacco industry is trying to get the state's federal
case moved from Texarkana to Austin, after its unsuccessful attempt to
move it to state court, claiming that the Attorney General of Texas, DAN
MORALES, would be more "at home" in Austin.  Arguing for the state,
Harvard Law Professor Arthur Miller stated that "all of Texas is home to
Dan Morales...."</P>

            <H2 align=center>What's Special About Special Counsel</H2>

<H4 align=center>from <I>Legal Times</I> July 4, 1994</H4>


<H4 align=center>BY JAMES E. TIERNEY</H4>



<P>James E. Tierney is an attorney living in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He was attorney
general of Maine from 1980 to 1990 and has served from 1992 until the present as a
special counsel concerning the allegations of wrongdoing within the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court. He also serves as a consultant to state attorneys general.</P>



<P>President Bill Clinton is expected soon to sign legislation reinstating the
independent-counsel law, which was allowed to lapse in late 1992. Although gussied up
with a few adjustments, the system created by the new statute is essentially the same
as the old system.</P>

<P>The change that really needs to be made--a change, by the way, that could just as
easily have been instituted under the earlier law--is this: Instead of appointing the
inevitable partner from a big law firm to discover a "truth" that the Department of
Justice (or a state or local prosecutor) is presumptively unable to find and/or act
upon, those who choose the special counsel need to draw from the ranks of full-time
public lawyers.</P>

<P>The arguments favoring the new federal law and the laws that are being introduced
each year in state legislatures make clear that the perceived need for special
prosecutors does not arise because of a lack of ability or integrity on the part of
our existing prosecutors. Rather, it derives from our lack of faith in the process we
have created to select them.</P>

<P>If we really believed that law enforcement was a cut-and -dried, mechanistic process,
we would adopt the career- prosecutor model that exists almost every where in the
world except the United States. Instead, we vote for our prosecutors or give the
power to appoint them to elected officials. For the same reason, even the attorney
general of the United States and his or her top aides are now subject, before
nomination and confirmation, to intense scrutiny by a myriad of interest groups
making sure that the candidates have the "right attitude" for the job.</P>

<P>The reality is that most of us want some laws enforced and some ignored. Of those we
want enforced, we often want them enforced in a certain way--our way. Despite
rhetoric to the contrary, we want prosecutors who share or can be swayed by popular
opinion.</P>

<P>It is, therefore, our own hypocrisy that occasionally forces us to turn to a special
prosecutor when democracy itself is on trial. Is our president a criminal? Is our
governor a crook? Did we once again elect someone who does not deserve to hold the
public trust in his or her hands? In these situations, the new law allows us to
revert to a less flexible rhetoric and to reject the very political system that
otherwise suits our desires. </P>

<H3>What Prosecutors Are Made Of</H3>

<P>In these situations, however, we often look for the right person in the wrong place.
What qualifications should a special prosecutor possess? With all due respect to
current and past special prosecutors, I do not think that the law-school record of a
proposed special prosecutor is terribly relevant. I don't really care if he or she
ever clerked at the U.S. Supreme Court. Most important, I don't think that
partnership in a mega-law firm automatically enhances the ability of anyone to serve
as a special prosecutor. In fact, the big-law- firm lifestyle--not to mention the
big-law- firm salary--draws a lawyer away from the real life that the rest of us
live.</P>

<P>Nowhere is this more clear than in an examination of the efforts of Independent
Counsel Lawrence Walsh in the Iran-Contra matter. Although Walsh's effort was
professional and comprehensive, his real failure was that America needed a prompt
answer and we didn't get it. By the time Walsh tendered his startling conclusions, no
one was listening. He didn't understand that our lives had moved on. He was just too
insulated.</P>

<P>What we really need in a special prosecutor is recent and practical prosecutorial
experience, unquestioned integrity, and, above all, a keen sense of justice. A
special prosecutor must have the personal integrity and courage to put aside the
intense pressures of the moment. The truly special prosecutor must be just as able to
prosecute the powerful as to say, "We didn't find anything."</P>

<P>An ample supply of all these skills already exists among our country's public
lawyers. If either the reality or the perception of conflict demands that the matter
being investigated be removed from local pressures, public prosecutors can be
appointed from another jurisdiction. This process is already routine in many states
and in the Justice Department. There is no reason it cannot be expanded.</P>

<P>In high-profile cases, the public's demand for a "name"- -the Archibald Cox
Syndrome--may often force policy- makers to reject this approach. When that occurs,
we should still insist- -by limiting the special prosecutor's budget--that the staff
of the special prosecutor be drawn from the ranks of existing prosecutors. </P>

<H3>The Best
on the Job
</H3>

<P>Remember, the calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor never have anything
to do with doubts about the career prosecutors who staff most offices. The hue and
cry arises for a special prosecutor because of the political past, present, or future
of the man or woman who sits at the top of the prosecutorial agency. There is simply
no evidence that career prosecutors are any more prone to be influenced by a
subject's status than any other attorney.</P>

<P>And that includes former prosecutors. I've never been able to understand why special
prosecutors tend to staff their teams with former assistant U.S. attorneys and former
assistant attorneys general, as if the "former" status somehow elevates them into
something, well, special.</P>

<P>In fact, there are many reasons why the best public lawyers do a far better job of
prosecuting than do former prosecutors now in the private sector. Because they
prosecute everyday, public lawyers are better able to examine allegations of
wrongdoing in a practical and evenhanded manner. They can compare and contrast their
special investigation with the rest of their caseload and discuss it with their
public colleagues. They know how current juries are reacting. They do not have to
worry about the impact their decisions will have on their firm and its clients. They
do not have to return to the trials of their youth for perspective. Most important,
they have not forgotten the meaning of prosecutorial discretion.</P>

<P>We should also not forget that former prosecutors are almost always something
else--something called defense attorneys. Many continue their defense practices even
as they work as part-time prosecutors. Even those that do take a temporary leave from
that world expect to return soon, and they cannot be oblivious to the effect that
their special prosecutorial stint will have on their future defense practice.</P>


<H3>Business as Usual</H3>

<P>In addition to these potential conflicts, use of outside counsel in prosecutions
raises another issue: Every time a special prosecutor is used, it says something
about the cases where one is not. It implies that the prosecutors we rely on for all
the other cases are somehow not up to the big ones. Do we really mean that? I would
hope not.</P>

<P>Special prosecutions do not, in fact, call for special prosecutorial skills. The
actual legal work done is not really very different from that performed regularly by
all prosecutors. It isn't the law that is different. It's simply the identity of the
person being investigated.</P>

<P>If special prosecutors occasionally outperform existing public lawyers, it's not
because of their skill, intellect, or private- sector status. Rather, it's because
they have been allocated resources that we never give our regular public prosecutors.
So if we want better performance, the key is simply to pay for it.</P>

<P>Some special prosecutors drawn from private practice undoubtedly share the elitism of
the high-priced legal world that dictates that quality and loyalty can best be found
in the ranks of large law firms. They are wrong. Loyalty comes from personal
character and allegiance to the law. Nowhere else.</P>

<P>If potential special prosecutors feel that existing public lawyers do not meet their
standards and should not form their staff, then they should decline the nomination
and stay in their law firm. They'll be fine. And so will we.</P>

            <H2 align=center>The State Attorney General: Who Is the Client?</H2>

<H4 align=center>September 1, 1995</H4>


<H4 align=center>BY JAMES E. TIERNEY</H4>


<P>     Hardly a day goes by when somewhere in the United States a newspaper headline
screams out a public disagreement between a state's Governor and that state's
Attorney General.</P>

<P>     *** In California, Governor Pete Wilson sued five state agencies in order to
invalidate his state's affirmative action laws.  Attorney General Dan Lungren, caught
with limited case law and with one client suing another, recused himself entirely.</P>

<P>     *** In Mississippi, Governor Kirk Fordice has demanded that a law suit filed by
his state against the tobacco industry be dismissed.  Attorney General Mike Moore,
armed with case law that gives him sweeping powers to control litigation, ignored his
Governor's entreaties.</P>

<P>     *** In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson has "fired" his Attorney General in a
landmark school voucher case and "hired" outside counsel who will be paid for with
private funds.  Attorney General Jim Doyle says that the Governor lacks the power to
either "fire" or "hire."</P>

<P>     *** In Arizona, Governor Fife Symington "appointed" a District Attorney to
investigate a prominent political supporter.  Attorney General Grant Woods said that
Governor's don't get to make that kind of decision and conducted the investigation
himself.</P>

<P>     *** In Massachusetts, Governor William Weld initially refused to reveal to his
attorney general a consultant's report that was prepared for regarding the clean up
of Boston Harbor.  Attorney General Scott Harshbarger threat to sue Weld was
necessary before the report was turned over.</P>



<P>     All of these recent cases and many more are focusing attention on an issue that
remains as controversial today as it did when St. Thomas Moore served as the Attorney
General of England.  What is the role of the modern state attorney general?  Who is
it that the attorney general represents?  What are the rules that govern that
representation?</P>

<P>     Very little has been written about the powers and duties of the state attorney
general.  It is therefore often difficult for judges, the private bar, governmental
agencies or the general public to fully understand who it is that the attorney
general represents in every instance.</P>

<P>     This article outlines the leading cases arising out of the representational
issues facing state attorneys general and discusses their implications.  It also
points to some of the practical considerations as to where the state attorney general
fits into modern federalism.</P>

<H3>The Modern Powers and Duties:</H3>

<P>     The modern office of attorney general did not appear overnight. Always a complex
and misunderstood institution, the state "attorney general does not fit neatly within
the framework described in the separation of powers..." Primarily an elected
position, almost all states decided long ago that the attorney general should be
constitutionally separate independent from the executive branch of government. By the
mid-twentieth century, the state attorney general had clearly become the chief law
enforcement officer of the state.</P>

<P>     While the parameters of authority vary from state to state, there is no question
that generally the state attorney general has a duty to appear for and represent
state government on legal matters. While in most states there are a few agencies that
are authorized to go to court without the attorney general, these are considered
exceptions to the general rule and as such these statutes are narrowly construed.</P>

<P>     The majority rule is that a state attorney general may undertake or refuse to
undertake any legal action that in his or her professional judgement serves the
public interest. Attorneys general have been granted "a significant degree of
autonomy" in making these decisions.</P>

<P>     The extent of the authority of an attorney general to assume positions adverse
to a governor or a client agency has spawned significant litigation.  Absent a
showing of bad faith on the part of the attorney general, the majority of
jurisdictions have upheld the right of the attorney general to override the views of
the executive branch of government.  This power includes, but is not limited to, the
authority to proceed initially, the right to settle or not settle, and the right to
file or not file an appeal over the objection of the executive branch.</P>

<P>     A 1977 Massachusetts case illustrates the complexities of this issue.  The case
arose when a woman was denied certification for two civil service jobs as the result
of her state's veteran preference laws. She alleged that these laws were inherently
discrimnatory against women and brought suit against several state agencies who were
represented in federal court by the staff of the attorney general. She prevailed at
the District Court level at which time the client agencies and the Governor asked the
attorney general to not appeal. Legislative resolutions were then promptly passed
that took the opposite position. The attorney general appealed. The Massachusetts
Supreme Court upheld the right of the attorney general to prosecute an appeal over
the objection of his client agencies stating that "the role of the attorney general
... is markedly different from the function of the administrative officials for whom
he appears."  In fact, the opposite conclusion "would effectively prevent the
attorney general from establishing and sustaining a uniform and consistent legal
policy for the Commonwealth."</P>

<P>     As one court made very clear, the state attorney general is "not required to
wait until someone else sues...and in the case of conflict of duties the attorney
general's primary obligation is to the Commonwealth, the body politic, rather than to
its officers, departments, commissions and agencies."</P>

<P>     Most courts have accorded their attorney general these rights only after
extended litigation.  Most base their rulings on the common law so that the outer
limits of the jurisdiction of an attorney general are not "exhaustively defined." 
Even where the attorney general is without common law authority, state courts cite
the explicit statutory state policy to consolidate their legal representation and are
therefore reluctant to allow state agencies to hire their own counsel upon the mere
allegation of a conflict.</P>

<P>     As one court noted, it "would defeat this apparent purpose to allow an agency
head, representing narrow interests and with a limited scope, to dictate a course of
conduct to the attorney general."  Another has said that the attorney general exists
not to represent "the particular interests of state agencies, but (to) embrace
serving or representing the broader interest of the state."      </P>

<P>     A recent Ohio case shows the wisdom of this policy. It began when Republican
Governor George Voinovich and the then Democratic Attorney General Lee Fisher
disagreed as to whether a decision by a state agency about the operation of a
contested minority "set aside" program would be appealed. Despite the fact that the
agency had ignored the legal advice it had received from Fisher's office, the
Governor stated that the Attorney General must, as a matter of law and
attorney/client ethics, adopt and defend the agency's position.  Fisher refused and
stated that his office would not countenance "ultra vires" actions by agencies.  An
intermediate appellate court found in favor of the attorney general.</P>

<P>     At this point Fisher was defeated by Republican Betty Montgomery. The political
pundits were therefore shocked when Montgomery, shortly after taking office, reviewed
the litigation and personally called Voinovich to tell him that she had concluded
that Fisher was right and that the Governor continued to be wrong.</P>

<P>     The story then took a strange twist when the Ohio Board of Education ignored the
Voinovich budget and, adopting the Governor's own argument, demanded that
Montgomery's office defend its decision.  An appalled Voinovich immediately faced a
very large problem if his Attorney General went to court to represent a Board that
was dedicated to wrecking his entire budget.  Beating a hasty retreat, Voinovich
begrudgingly acknowledged that the Attorney General of Ohio is something more than
the legal spokesperson for every state agency.  He retreated on the "set aside" issue
and the case was resolved.</P>

<P>     This issue has resulted in legal authority that extends so far as to deny to the
executive branch of state government the ability to assert an attorney-client
relationship in an attempt to prohibit an attorney general from discussing the
state's legal matters with the with the legislature or the public.</P>

<P>     In some jurisdictions, state statutes have overridden the common law thereby
subjecting the attorney general to the decisions of the Governor or a state agency. 
Even in these instances, however, the attorney general may refuse to represent a
governmental agency he or she feels is acting unconstitutionally or proceeding beyond
its statutory duty so long as permission is granted for the employment of private
counsel.</P>

<P>        The state attorney general therefore has a wide scope of jurisdiction.  An
attorney general is always able to bring actions against a state official whom the
attorney general believes has violated a law that the attorney general has the
responsibility to enforce notwithstanding representation of that official on other
matters.  The attorney general may argue that a statute is unconstitutional even
where the state is not a party to the litigation.  In several states, the attorney
general may appear on both sides of the same case.</P>

<H3>The Model Rules of Professional Ethics:</H3>

<P>     These court rulings obviously give rise attorney-client ethical issues that are
dramatically different from those faced by the private bar.  Indeed, most private
lawyers and new governmental office holders are surprised by the difference and have
consequently groped to find ways to stuff the myriad of situations faced by state
governmental lawyers into the same rules followed by private lawyers.  All attempts
have failed.</P>

<P>     The first written attempt was by the Committee on Ethics and Professional
Responsibility of the American Bar Association.  In Formal Opinion No. # 342, the
Committee stated that although most ethical rules generally apply to public lawyers,
"necessity dictates" that "the relationship among lawyers within a governmental
agency are different from those among partners and associates of a law firm."</P>

<P>     This Opinion, issued at a time of increased public advocacy by state attorneys
general, resulted in an extended debate within the Committee. The Committee discussed
several extensive amendments to the pending drafts of the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, but each was met with a flurry of opposition from public lawyers who felt
both underrepresented and misunderstood in the process.</P>

<P>     When the Model Rules were finally promulgated in 1983, the Committee discarded
the extensive drafts and addressed the issue in a simple amendment to the Preamble. 
The relevant section states that lawyer's in an attorney general's office "may be
authorized to represent several governmental agencies in intragovernmental legal
controversies in circumstances where a private lawyer could not represent multiple
private clients.  They also have the authority to represent 'the public interest' in
circumstances where a private lawyer would not be authorized to do so.  These Rules
do not abrogate that authority."</P>

<P>     The Preamble therefore goes clearly beyond Opinion No. 342 and in doing so turns
the issue over the courts who generally give attorneys general great discretion so
long as it is administered in good faith.</P>

<P>     Sound public policy considerations underlie these conclusions.</P>

<P>Modern state government contains a great number of agencies, boards and commissions
that every day make decisions with broad legal implications.  These departments are
required to view their responsibilities through the sometimes narrow lens of their
peculiar statutory framework.  In their zeal to carry out their agency specific
mandates, they obviously need sound and consistent legal advice.  If an office of
attorney general was unable to utilize discretion in this representation, then the
practical result would be state agencies who would regularly reach contradictory
interpretations of the law.</P>

<P>     Virtually every state has sought to avoid this through the centralization of its
legal services under the control of an attorney general. That virtually all state
attorneys general, unlike the United State Attorney General, are independent is a
reflection that the state attorney general is constitutionally required to be a break
on executive power.  Indeed, the attorney general clearly fulfilled this function at
common law.</P>

<P>     This does little, however, to mitigate the daily frustrations of other elected
officials - such as a governor - and agencies who complain that they do not get the
level of service that they believe appropriate.  Especially for those who assume
these positions without prior governmental experience, they are angry and confused
when they cannot simply instruct their lawyers in a manner consistent with the
private sector. It is this frustration that boils over into the front pages leaving a
confused public wondering what the fight is all about.</P>

<H3>Limitations of the Powers and Duties of a State Attorney General:</H3>

<P>     State appellate courts have not always upheld the authority of state attorneys
general.  In states where the attorney general is appointed for a term conterminous
with the governor, the issue has never arisen. At least one state has simply rejected
the very concept that a state attorney general has responsibilities any different
from that of a private lawyer.  In other states, the court simply ruled that the
attorney general had acted in bad faith.  In others, that the attorney general had
played too fast and loose with his responsibilities in a thinly veiled attempt to
gain political advantage.</P>

<P>     The discretion potentially available to a state attorney general in most
jurisdictions is obviously very rare at any level of American government.  Because
these expansive powers remain legally controversial and politically explosive, most
attorneys general are extraordinarily careful in developing sound attorney- client
relations.</P>

<P>     Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods recently described his view of this issue
by stating that "the attorney general must defend the state or a particular agency if
he can do so in good faith and the position is not contradictory to another position
taken by the State.  I apply a Rule 11 analysis, which results in me defending
positions with which I personally disagree, but upon which we can proceed in good
faith.  I think the attorney general has an obligation first to the people of the
State in seeing that the laws are upheld in both their spirit and letter, but the
policymaking must be left to others or to the attorney general's public, as opposed
to courtroom, role."</P>

<P>     Virtually all state attorneys general have therefore developed extensive written
office policies that institutionalize this approach to potential representational
conflicts.</P>

<P>     There are many reasons for this standard.  The first is that state attorneys
general know full well that they are in the business of providing legal and not
policy advice to state government.  They know they were not elected to be policy
makers in non-legal areas.  For that reason alone, most offices of attorney general
strive to approximate the same attorney client relationships that exist in the world
of private practice.   In other words, on a day to day basis the staffs of attorneys
general answer routine legal questions and outline legal options for state agencies,
usually protected by the attorney-client privilege, and the agencies then decide what
they want to do.  The attorney general then backs their position in the face of legal
assault.</P>

<P>     Most attorney general know that this in not only the right thing to do, it is
also the most practical thing to do.  They know that governors, state cabinet members
and state legislators are unwilling to cede broad areas of decision making to an
independent attorney general.  Even if unsuccessful in mounting a legal challenge to
an attorney general, the executive and legislative branches know full well how to
utilize the power of the budget to curtail an attorney general who is too independent
to their liking.</P>

<P>State capitols are therefore replete with on-going threats as to just how many
assistant attorneys general will be laid off in the process of drafting new state
budgets.  These threats are not idle and tend to focus the attention of even the
busiest attorney general.</P>

<P>     The entire representational issue has been vastly complicated by the tremendous
increase in "in-house" lawyers that now permeate state government.  Although usually
unable to go to court, these lawyers work directly for the state agencies and have
every reason to facilitate their employer's wishes without regard to the state's
overall legal policies.</P>

<P>     These on-going battles are all the more significant at a time when the amount of
state resources being directed toward enforcement of existing laws is declining.  The
increased number of laws and the decreasing prosecutorial resources make this kind of
friction inevitable.</P>
   
<H3>Challenges:
</H3>
<P>     The pressures brought about by these circumstances call out for both patience
and understanding by all parties.  The simple fact is that despite great rhetoric and
persistent attempts, there has been no successful effort to undercut the basic
jurisdiction of any state attorney general.  Annual attempts by governors to make
their attorney general an appointed position have been roundly rejected.  Like it or
not, governors and attorneys general will have to learn to work together.</P>

<P>     This means that a positive day to day relationship at the upper levels of the
staffs of both the governor and the attorney general is essential. Acknowledging that
friction is inevitable, all steps must be taken to separate the legitimate
disagreements over legal policy from the need to meet the everyday legal needs of
state government.  That in turn can only happen if all parties take the time to learn
the history and the purpose of the office of state attorney general.</P>

            <H2 align=center>Opinions</H2>

<H4 align=center>from <I>Pass It On</I> -  the Newsletter of the Public Lawyer Secion of
the American Bar Association, October/November 1995</H4>


<H4 align=center>BY JAMES E. TIERNEY</H4>

<P>     The Soviet Union has been dissolved.  The Berlin Wall has become a pile of
rubble. The members of the Warsaw Pact are scrambling to join NATO.  But in the great
State of Texas, where college scholarships are statutorily available to veterans of
"the Cold War," Attorney General Dan Morales has ruled in an opinion that because no
one can determine exactly when the "Cold War" ended, then it hasn't.</P>

<P>     How could such a ruling, so obviously at variance with reality, emerge in 1995? 
Where did the request come from?  Why does the Attorney General get to decide?  How
was it researched? Who does it bind?  Does it make any sense?</P>

<P>     In order to answer these and many other questions, it is necessary to understand
the responsibility of state attorneys general to issue formal Opinions.</P>

<H3>History:</H3>

<P>     The concept of the formal "Opinion of the Attorney General" is found in all
fifty states and all territories.  State statutes and often constitutions have from
the time of statehood codified the common law responsibility of the state attorney
general to, in the words of the Arizona law, "render a written opinion upon any
question of law relating to their offices" when asked to do so by "the Legislature or
either house thereof, any public officer of the state or a county attorney."</P>

<P>     The historical reasons for the Opinion process are clear. Begun at a time when
there was a shortage of lawyers and limited access to the courts before the universal
acceptance of actions for declaratory judgement, an Opinion of a state attorney
general provided a quick and inexpensive way to definitively answer a legal question.</P>

   
<P>     As state government grew in the 1960's and 1970's, however, the Opinion process
exploded.  Agencies and private parties, usually by prevailing on a legislator to
make a request, inundated state attorneys general with requests for Opinions. 
Attorneys general, seeing Opinions as a way to short cut time consuming litigation
and get publicity, issued them by the thousands.  Often cursory in nature, it was not
surprising that they were increasingly ignored and in many cases just plain wrong.</P>

<H3>Reforms:</H3>

<P>     The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) responded to this situation
in 1971 by passing a Resolution urging its membership to limit opinions to subjects
of statewide significance and immediate importance.  It also urged its members to not
issue opinions that were hypothetical, based in fact as opposed to law, clearly
private in nature and, most important, subject to pending or likely litigation.</P>

<P>     Having passed the Resolution, the attorneys general of the 1970's ignored it and
the number or Opinion issued continued to climb. Governors, client agencies,
legislators and increasingly private parties clamored for the support of the state
attorney general on issues great and small.</P>

<P>     As the 1980's began, the situation continued to deteriorate. Attorneys general
found that their Opinions requests were rarely an honest intellectual inquiry for
legal guidance.  Instead, attorneys general were being asked to become involved with
political squabbles, often local in nature, where other lawyers had already given an
opinion.  Some wanted the attorney general to take responsibility for unpopular but
clearly legally mandated decisions. Others, disgruntled with their initial legal
advice, "appealed" to the attorney general to get another "free" opinion or in some
cases just to gain a delay from the inevitable. State attorneys general soon found
that their Opinions were not making anyone very happy for very long.</P>

<P>     At the same time, anti-Opinion feelings were rising within the staffs of the
attorneys general.  Litigating Assistant Attorneys General were constantly having old
Opinions of their office waved in their faces by opposing counsel. It was not a
pretty sight.</P>

<P>     Anxious to avoid these mistakes, attorneys general first attempt at reform was
to "make sure the Opinion is right." Opinions therefore were increasingly assigned to
senior lawyers who were forced to disappear into the law library, and away from their
burgeoning case loads, to research relatively minor issues. Opinions increased in
length, the number of footnotes escalated, and the phrase "although the matter is not
entirely free from doubt" became a mandatory one in virtually every conclusion.</P>

<P>     By the end of the 1980's and into the 1990's, state attorneys general, one by
one, addressed the concerns inherent in the Opinion process and began to see that the
1971 NAAG Resolution was indeed the right way to go.</P>

<P>     Most began by making it clear that official Opinions were not the personal
opinions of the attorney general and that formal Opinions would not be vehicles for
carrying out anyone's political agenda.  Indeed, the standard to be used by their
offices in the Opinion process would be quasi-judicial in nature. While the requester
could submit their views or even a brief, there would be no "ex parte"
communications.  The Opinion process was therefore to be about law and not about
advocacy, personal opinion, politics and personal relationships.</P>

<P>      The importance of the quasi-judicial standard cannot be underestimated. While
an Opinion may or may not be legally "binding" on those who receive it, it is
certainly determinative of the position of the Office of Attorney General.  A state
official who fails to get the Opinion it "wants"  must then live the fact that their
own Attorney General will be opposing them if litigation ensues.  If they had not
requested the Opinion, and the attorney general was free to act in his or her more
familiar advocacy role, then the attorney general would be on their side. When
attorneys general sternly made this point clear, many who requested Opinions began to
appreciate the risk and withdrew their requests.</P>

<P>     The second major step was to establish a formal internal procedure for Opinion
reviewed that was staffed with career lawyers of impeccable reputations within the
legal community.  Most offices then developed procedures, often in writing, for
initially determining whether or not an Opinion will issue and that decision is made
before the matter is even assigned for research.  If the request survives this first
review, the matter is exhaustively researched by a staff member familiar with the
subject matter and then subject to a formal policy review by the state Solicitor
General, the Chief Deputy and sometimes the Attorney General. With an actual draft
Opinion in hand, these intense reviews often lead to modifications or even a reversal
of the initial decision to issue the Opinion at all.</P>

<P>     These reforms have by and large succeeded in full implementation of the 1971
NAAG Resolution.  Newly elected attorneys general may still revert to the old ways,
sometimes even reversing the Opinions of a predecessor, but most soon learn that such
a move is rarely worth the effort.  The number of formal Opinions has therefore
plummeted even as informal agency advice, that is usually protected by the attorney
client privilege, has increased.  Attorneys general have clearly moved away from
being a quasi-judge and toward being a counsel for public clients and an advocate for
the public interest.</P>

<H3>Value of Attorney General Opinions:</H3>

<P>     This is not to say that there is not a place in the toolbox of a state attorney
general for a well crafted Opinion.  Indeed, because they are now rarely issued, they
have climbed in both credibility and acceptance.  There are currently two legal areas
where Opinions appear to be more important than ever.</P>

<P>     The first is when two state agencies have inconsistent views of the same
statute.  An Opinion of the attorney general often settles the issue once and for all
especially when the state agencies cannot go into court without the representation or
permission of the attorney general.</P>

<P>     The second is when citizen organizations turn to the referendum process in order
to urge voters to pass legislation or change a state constitution.  In these very
public campaigns where emotions run so high that long cherished principles can be
forgotten, an Opinion of the state attorney general can break through the roar of the
campaign and educate an often confused citizenry as to what it all means.</P>

<P>     So will "the Cold War" ever end in Texas?  Faced with no legal basis for
reversing past practices and with no intervening legislative action, it is highly
unlikely that the Attorney General will change his mind.  If I were a veteran in
Texas in need of a scholarship, I'd be in no rush to fill out the forms.</P>

            <H2 align=center>The Governor and the State Attorney General: Irreconcilable Differences?</H2>

<H4 align=center>from <I>Pass It On</I> -- The
Newsletter of the Government and Public Sector Lawyers Division of the American Bar
Association.</H4>


<H4 align=center>BY JAMES E. TIERNEY</H4>


<P>     Almost no one in Arizona was surprised last month when a columnist for The
Arizona Republic wrote that Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods gets along with his
Governor, Fife Symington, "the way F. Lee Bailey gets along with Marcia Clark."  For
the last four years, these two popular Republicans have been engaged in an
extraordinary public power struggle over who has the right to chart their state's
legal policy.</P>

<P>     Although their controversies are not unmarked by their strong personalities, any
student of state constitutional governance would immediately recognize that some
friction between Governors and Attorneys General, 43 of whom are elected statewide,
is inevitable. Indeed, there are those who would say that the friction is
constitutionally mandated and as appropriate now as it was when St. Thomas More, as
Chancellor of England, refused a directive from his King that he felt contravened his
higher duty to the law.</P>

<P>     Nowhere was this issue more clear than in a recent Ohio case. It began when
Republican Governor George Voinovich and the then Democratic Attorney General Lee
Fisher disagreed as to whether a decision by a state agency about the operation of a
contested minority "set aside" program would be appealed. Despite the fact that the
agency had ignored the legal advice it received from Fisher's office, the Governor
stated that the Attorney General must, as a matter of law and attorney/client ethics,
adopt and defend the agency's position.  Fisher refused and stated that his office
would not countenance "ultra vires" actions by agencies. The issue of the duty of the
Ohio attorney general to represent state agencies then headed for court where an
intermediate appellate court found in favor of the attorney general.</P>

<P>     At this point politics intervened as the voters decided that Fisher should be
replaced by Republican Betty Montgomery who had received an extraordinary amount of
political support from Voinovich.  The political pundits were therefore shocked when
Montgomery, shortly after taking office, reviewed the litigation and personally
called Voinovich in order to tell him that she had concluded that Fisher was right
and that the Governor continued to be very, very wrong.</P>

<P>     The story then took a strange twist when the Ohio Board of Education ignored the
Voinovich budget and, adopting the Governor's own argument, demanded that
Montgomery's office defend its decision.  An appalled Voinovich immediately face a
very large problem if his Attorney General went to court to represent a Board that
was dedicated to wrecking his entire budget.  Beating a hasty retreat, Voinovich
begrudgingly acknowledged that the Attorney General of Ohio is something more than
the legal spokesperson for every state agency.</P>

<P>     This issue continues to be fought out in state after state. Many newly elected
Governors, often at the urging of their cabinet and interest groups who have tangled
with the attorney general, begin their terms by attempting to gain control of both
the jurisdiction and the budget of the attorney general. Sometimes the fights are
very public. In Mississippi, for example, the Governor is working hard to stop the
litigation brought by his Attorney General against the tobacco industry.  In New
Mexico, the Attorney General has refused to represent the Governor in his attempt to
restrict state abortion funding. In Massachusetts, the Attorney General has
threatened to sue the Governor for access to the report that details environmental
problems that exist at state facilities.</P>

<P>     In several other states, governors are attempting to order their state agencies
not to refer enforcement matters to their attorney general without prior
gubernatorial approval. Finally, state agencies everywhere continue to spar with
their attorneys general over public records requests.</P>

<P>     It is unfortunate that the media almost always interprets this friction between
the governor and the attorney general through the prism of personality and politics. 
Public lawyers representing or serving in state agencies, whether or not they are in
an office of attorney general, read these press accounts and shudder wondering what
it means, if anything, for their own daily attorney client relationships.  Public
lawyers outside state government are even more bewildered.</P>

<P>     Case law in most, but not all, states favors the attorney general. As one state
high court ruled, "the attorney general's primary obligation is to the Commonwealth,
the body politic, rather than to its officers, departments, commissions and
agencies,"  or, as another state's high court ruled, the "broader interests of the
state." The American Bar Association itself recognizes the uniqueness and common law
heritage of the state attorney general. It states in the Preamble of the Model Rules
of Professional Conduct that lawyers in an attorney general's office may "have the
authority to represent 'the public interest' in circumstances where a private lawyer
would not be authorized to do so" and that "these rules do not abrogate that
authority."</P>

<P>     On the other hand, raw political power, especially the power of the budget,
favors the governor especially since an increasing number of the staff of an attorney
general are funded from the budgets of various state agencies. The everyday power to
chart a state's legal policy is therefore clearly not solely within the hands of the
attorney general.</P>

<P>     Experience shows that these battles of the political titans, called by one
Virginia judge an "all too public spectacle," are almost always settled without
impacting the vast majority of other state legal decisions.  It is important that
state lawyers, regardless of whether or not they work within the office of attorney
general, keep to the tasks at hand and not be distracted by the distant rumbles. The
ultimate self interest for state elected officials in these matters is almost always
cooperation.</P>

<P>     Lawyers who work for cities, counties, state agencies or the federal government
should not be quick to join the chorus and disparage these battles between the office
of attorney general and the executive branches of state government.  These
disagreements are almost always based in sincerely held believes about the legality
of important public policy decisions.  Although sometimes difficult, the friction is
an essential element of our system of checks and balances and produces results that
are to the betterment of all the citizens that public lawyers are here to serve.</P>

            <H2 align=center>NAAG Antitrust</H2>

<H4 align=center>from <I>Pass It On</I> -  the Newsletter of the Public Lawyer Secion of
the American Bar Association, February/March, 1996</H4>


<H4 align=center>BY JAMES E. TIERNEY</H4>
    

<P>     On May 4, 1995, the giant shoe manufacturer Reebok International,Inc.
agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by all fifty state attorneys general - and
it cost them a lot of money.  As the direct result of the work of the
National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) and its Multi-state
Antitrust Task Force, Reebok agreed to change its sales practices and pay
$9.5 million to be distributed by each attorney general to public athletic
facilities for improvement and refurbishing projects.</P>

<P>     Reebok wasn't the first giant shoe manufacturer to pay dearly. In
1993, the Keds Corporation forked over $7.2 million to settle accusations
that they had conspired illegally in the way in which they marketed women's
athletic shoes.  The monies went to charities in each state that benefit
women between the ages of 15 and 44 - Keds' target audience.</P>

<P>     How does this happen?  How do fifty states with attorneys general of
vastly different political philosophies get together and bring lawsuits
against giant companies?  Does this kind of enforcement responsibility
belong to the federal government?</P>
<H4>HISTORY</H4>
<P>      The answer to that question lies in the history of state
antitrust enforcement.  All fifty attorneys general enforce state antitrust
laws most of which are patterned on or analogous to Sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act. Indeed, many state laws predate the federal laws and are found
in state constitutions. Further, all state attorneys general are authorized
to also go into federal court to enforce federal civil antitrust statutes
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, which specifically provides that
state attorneys general can represent their citizens in a parens patriae
capacity. Antitrust law is therefore an area where state attorneys general
are able to utilize tremendous prosecutorial discretion.</P>

<P>     State attorneys general historically deferred to the U.S. Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on the largest enforcement
actions and limited their role to smaller cases impacting only on their own
state.  Even there, however, their action was rare.  During the 1970's,
however, the federal government made grants to the states that allowed
attorneys general to beef up their staffs and therefore play a larger role.
 Many of those cases focused on highway bid rigging and resulted in
extraordinary benefits to state taxpayers who began to see state antitrust
enforcement as a very good thing.</P>

<P>     The election of 1980, however, created a severe gap between state
attorneys general who sought to actively enforce antitrust laws and the
Reagan Administration who took a more conservative approach.  In fact, many
federal officials and leading members of the private bar stated publicly
that state attorneys general were trying to micro-manage the economy and
were therefore acting contrary to national economic priorities.</P>

<P>     State attorneys general persevered, however, and it was only when the
then California Attorney General John Van de Kamp prevailed before the
United States Supreme Court in California v. American Stores 495 U.S. 271
(1990) that the law was clarified.  In that decision, the Court ruled that
the State of California was not prohibited from attempting to block a
proposed merger under its state antitrust laws notwithstanding the fact
that federal agencies had already given the merger a green light.</P>
<H4>TODAY</H4>
<P>      With the authority of the states upheld, the antitrust world 
began to change.  The private bar, realizing that state antitrust
enforcement was not going to disappear, began to extend greater respect to
state enforcers.  No ABA Antitrust Committee meeting would ever again be
complete without input from representatives of the states.  A constructive
dialogue has emerged that is on-going and evolving.  In short, all parties
now know that the states are here to stay.</P>

<P>     Politically, the gap between the federal government and state
attorneys general began to close when the Assistant Attorney General for
Antitrust during the Bush Administration, James Rill, and Federal Trade
Commission Chair Janet Steiger extended an olive branch to state enforcers.
The current Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, Anne Bingaman, who
when in private practice in the 1980's was a regular attendee at the NAAG
Antitrust Committee meetings, and F.T.C. Chair Robert Pitofsky have sent a
clear message to their staffs that cooperation with the states is now the
rule.  Few investigations now occur without information sharing among state
and federal officials.  Indeed, Bingaman hired Virginia Assistant Attorney
General Milton Marquis, an active participant in NAAG efforts, to serve as
a full time liaison between her office and the attorneys general.</P>
<H4>STRUCTURE</H4>
<P>     Most state attorneys general now have antitrust divisions
usually located as part of the Consumer or Public Protection Divisions
within their office.  The number of specific lawyers assigned full time to
antitrust is usually quite small, but when particular cases arise most
attorneys general will assign senior civil litigators to assist on a
particular matter.  Most states pay for these divisions with direct
appropriations, and some fund some portion of their work "revolving funds"
paid for by fines and settlements.</P>

<P>     Today, few matters of economic importance escape the review of state
antitrust enforcers.  Sometimes these actions generate tremendous national
publicity such as when Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon threatened to
sue the National Football League if the N.F.L. owners blocked the move of a
professional team to St. Louis.  Most cases, however, are about more day to
day economic changes that might otherwise never be reviewed for their
impact on the public interest.
 </P> 
<P>     In the New England area, for example, several proposed banking mergers
have been substantially modified by the intervention of state attorneys
general. In Massachusetts, a bank merger was only allowed to proceed when
the bank agreed to make $370 million available for small business loans and
for affordable housing. The same merger was not allowed in Connecticut
until 28 suburban branches were divested as a bloc and millions of dollars
were dedicated to home improvements in low and moderate income
neighborhoods.</P>

<P>     Many state attorneys general are currently reviewing the great number
of proposed hospital mergers.  Many have also moved to modify mergers in
the grocery and pharmacy chain industries.</P>
<H4> MULTI-STATE EFFORTS</H4>
<P>     The NAAG Multi-state Antitrust Task Force
consists of the antitrust staffs from all fifty states who meet twice a
year in person, monthly by conference call and almost daily by means of
e-mail. This tightly knit non-partisan group of career prosecutors is
currently chaired by Wisconsin Assistant Attorney General Kevin O'Connor,
who holds his law degree from Harvard Law School and his PhD from the
University of Wisconsin.  The Committee is staffed full time in Washington
at NAAG by Staff Counsel Emily Myers.  In the last few years, the Task
Force has successfully concluded multi-million dollar settlements in the
airline, insurance, and cable industries and investigations are always
ongoing.  Committee of the Task Force focus on specific industries, such as
 health care and information systems.  An electronic mail system allows
state attorneys general offices to work together as if they were in one
large law firm.</P>

<P>     The Task Force does more than bring cases. In March of 1993, after two
years of intensive study and dialogue with federal officials and the
private bar, the Task Force recommended and the state attorneys general
approved without dissent revisions to the Horizontal Merger Guidelines that
had been originally passed in 1987.  In March of 1995, after a similar
review, the attorneys general passed revisions to the NAAG Vertical
Restraints Guidelines that had been passed in 1985.</P>

<P>     These guideline give to the private sector a clear indication of the
philosophy that most attorneys general will follow in antitrust
enforcement.  Task Force members conduct an intense speaking and
educational schedule in order to make clear to industry what is expected of
them by state enforcers.  They also coordinate the filings of amicus briefs
on antitrust issues and closely monitor federal legislation.</P>
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>
<P>      The goal of state attorneys general is not high profile
litigation.  Rather, the attorneys general seek to enforce the law so that
our economy can function in an open and fully competitive manner.</P>

The firm's practice includes advice and representation in regulatory and legislative matters,  litigation,  and transactional work both here and abroad.<P><CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Litigation Practice Group</H3></CENTER><P>Throughout its history,  Covington  & Burling's practice has been heavily concentrated on the litigation of complex,  difficult,  important,  and novel matters. The firm's litigation practice continues to reflect those characteristics and today runs the gamut of subject-matter areas,  including antitrust,  employment,  environmental,  insurance coverage,  intellectual property,  product liability,  professional responsibility,  securities,  toxic tort,  and regulatory cases in judicial,  arbitral,  and administrative forums across the country and overseas. The hallmarks of our litigation practice are mastery of the law,  the formulation and execution of effective and creative strategies,  cost-sensitive case management,  and adherence to the highest professional standards.<BR><BR><P>Many of our cases require us to navigate undeveloped and uncertain areas of law and fact. Last year,  for example,  in a case presenting novel questions of commodities law pertinent to foreign currency derivatives trading,  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a substantial trial court judgment that we had obtained for our client,  a subsidiary of Salomon Brothers. <B>Eugene Gulland </B>and<B> William Iverson</B>,  who took the lead in that litigation,  have each handled many major litigation matters in the antitrust and securities fields.<BR><BR><P>In the intellectual property area,  we have filed pathbreaking lawsuits to curb the importation of gray market goods. On behalf of Parfums Givenchy,  we recently obtained a Ninth Circuit affirmance of an injunction barring such imports under the copyright laws. Our wide-ranging intellectual property practice has also included recent trial representations of AT &T,  the American Petroleum Institute,  the National Football League,  and Sun Life of Canada. <B>Charles Buffon</B>,  who has substantial experience in various areas of commercial litigation,  leads the firm's intellectual property litigation practice.<BR><BR><P>The firm's ability to operate in uncharted areas and successfully to take major cases to trial is evidenced by our pioneering representation of corporate policyholders in lawsuits against their insurance carriers. <B>Robert Sayler</B>,  who recently served as chair of the ABA's Section of Litigation,  was lead trial counsel for Armstrong World Industries in the California coordinated asbestos insurance coverage litigation,  said to be the lengthiest civil trial in United States history. The firm's success at the trial of that case was replicated when we later obtained for Boeing the first jury verdict for a major corporate insured in an environmental insurance coverage case. The successes of the firm in this area have steadily mounted,  and include victories in trials and arbitrations,  as well as through highly favorable settlements.<BR><BR><P>Our track record in more traditional areas of litigation is equally strong. <B>Peter Nickles</B>, <B> Herbert Dym</B>,  and<B> Joanne Grossman</B>,  whose work reflects the breadth of the firm's litigation practice,  have substantial experience defending complex toxic tort and product liability cases,  including cases pursued as class actions or on a coordinated basis. <B>Bruce Baird</B>,  who headed the securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney's office in New York City,  is a mainstay of the firm's criminal and securities fraud practices. <B>Jeffrey Huvelle</B>,  who secured a jury verdict for the defense earlier this year in a race discrimination lawsuit against the World Football League,  also represents IBM and other companies throughout the country in employment cases.<BR><BR><P><B>Bobby Burchfield</B> and<B> Mark Lynch</B>,  whose litigation practices span numerous subject-matter areas,  recently played leading roles in the firm's successful efforts to extricate National Medical Enterprises from a maze of civil lawsuits and criminal investigations. <B>Arvid Roach</B>,  whose roster of litigation clients includes Union Pacific,  has an impressive array of successes in transportation and pension-related matters. Finally,  while many of the firm's trial lawyers are experienced appellate advocates,  <B>Edward Bruce</B> is widely recognized for his work in appeals courts throughout the country and in the Supreme Court.<BR><BR><P><B>Gregg Levy</B>,  whose antitrust work has included recent victories for the National Football League,  and <B>Mitchell Dolin</B>,  who represents Exxon and other policyholders in insurance coverage lawsuits,  coordinate the firm's 150-lawyer litigation practice group and are available to provide additional information.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></UL></BODY></HTML>

<P><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></P>

<P>Procedural Background</P>

<P>Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency Act
of 1996 (CDA or "the Act"), which constitutes Title V of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, signed into law by the President on February 8, 1996.(1) 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, Section 502, 110 Stat. 56,
133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations and individuals who, inter
alia, are associated with the computer and/or communications industries, or who
publish or post materials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen groups. 
See ACLU Complaint (Paragraphs 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint (Paragraphs 3,
12-33).</P>

<P>The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the
United States, and the United States Department of Justice.  For convenience, we
will refer to these defendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the
two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to communications over
the Internet which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
minors, defined as persons under the age of eighteen, infringe upon rights
protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which the lead plaintiff is the
American Civil Liberties Union (the ACLU),(2) filed their action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the
Act was signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15, 1996, following
an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, to whom the case had been
assigned, granted a limited temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum
that 47 U.S.C. Section 223(a)(1)(B) ("the indecency provision" of the CDA) was
unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter,
Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, having
been requested by the parties and the district court to convene a three-judge
court, pursuant to Section 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a court consisting
of, in addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of the same district,
and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C. Section 2284.</P>

<P>After a conference with the court, the parties entered into a stipulation, which
the court approved on February 26, 1996, wherein the Attorney General agreed
that: she will not initiate any investigations or prosecutions for violations of
47 U.S.C. Section 223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision
until the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction
. . . and has decided the motion.</P>

<P>The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:</P>

<P>her full authority to investigate or prosecute any violation of Section
223(a)(1)(B), as amended, and Section 223(d) as to conduct which occurs or
occurred during any period of time after enactment of these provisions
(including for the period of time to which this stipulation applies) should the
Court deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is granted, should these
provisions ultimately be upheld.</P>

<P>Stipulation, Paragraph 4, in C.A. No. 96-963.</P>

<P>Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association, Inc. (the ALA) and
others(3) filed a similar action at C.A. No. 96-1458.  On February 27, 1996,
Chief Judge Sloviter, again pursuant to Section 561(a) of the CDA and upon
request, convened the same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2284.
The actions were consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), "for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary injunction in
these cases, including the hearing on such motions."</P>

<P>The parties were afforded expedited discovery in connection with the motions for
preliminary injunction, and they cooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been
assigned the case management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court began receiving
evidence at the consolidated hearings which were conducted on March 21 and 22,
and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In order to expedite the proceedings, the parties
worked closely with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before the court by
sworn declarations, so that the hearings were largely devoted to
cross-examination of certain of the witnesses whose declarations had been filed.
The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on
April 29, and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.(4)</P>


<P>Statutory Provisions at Issue</P>

<P>Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions of section 502 of the CDA
which amend 47 U.S.C. Sections 223(a) and 223(d).</P>

<P>Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person in interstate or foreign
communications who, "by means of a telecommunications device,"(5) "knowingly...
makes, creates, or solicits" and "initiates the transmission" of "any comment,
request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication which is obscene or
indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18 years of
age," "shall be criminally fined or imprisoned." (emphasis added).</P>

<P>Section 223(d)(1) ("the patently offensive provision"), makes it a crime to use
an "interactive computer service"(6) to "send" or "display in a manner
available" to a person under age 18, "any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such
service placed the call or initiated the communication."</P>

<P>Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the provisions in Section
223(a)(2) and Section 223(d)(2), which make it a crime for anyone to "knowingly
permit[] any telecommunications facility under [his or her] control to be used
for any activity prohibited" in Sections 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1). The
challenged provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the statute to the extent
that it covers obscenity or child pornography, which were already proscribed
before the CDA's adoption.  See 18 U.S.C. Sections 1464-65 (criminalizing
obscene material); id. Sections 2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography); see
also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15
(1973). Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge the provision of the CDA
that criminalizes speech over the Internet that transmits information about
abortions or abortifacient drugs and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C.
Section 1462(c).  That section now prohibits the sending and receiving of
information over the Internet by any means regarding "where, how, or of whom, or
by what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or
intended for producing abortion] may be obtained or made". The Government has
stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of
the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c).(7)</P>

<P>As part of its argument that the CDA passes constitutional muster, the
Government cites the CDA's "safe harbor" defenses in new Section 223(e) of 47
U.S.C., which provides:</P>


<P>(e) Defenses</P>

<P>In addition to any other defenses available by law:</P>

<P>(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) of this
section solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system,
or network not under that person's control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the
creation of the content of the communication.</P>

<P>(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in
the creation or knowing distribution of communications that violate this
section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.</P>

<P>(3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who provides access or connection to a facility, system,
or network engaged in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled
by such person.</P>

<P>(4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for the actions of an
employee or agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is within the scope
of his or her employment or agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of such
conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly disregards such
conduct.</P>

<P>(5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of this
section, or under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the use of a
facility for an activity under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --</P>

<P>(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication specified in such subsections, which may involve any appropriate
measures to restrict minors from such communications, including any method which
is feasible under available technology; or</P>

<P>(B) has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a verified
credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.</P>

<P>(6) The [Federal Communications] Commission may describe measures which are
reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited
communications under subsection (d) of this section.  Nothing in this section
authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to provide the Commission
with the authority to approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such measures.
The Commission shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize
such measures. . . .</P>


<P>II.</P>

<P><H3>FINDINGS OF FACT</H3></P>

<P>All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal questions at issue in
these cases, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the exponentially
growing, worldwide medium that is the Internet, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and due process
requirements to this new and evolving method of communication.  For this reason
all parties insisted on having extensive evidentiary hearings before the
three-judge court. The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are not in
dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following Findings of fact
are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of a stipulation(8) the parties
filed with the court.(9)</P>


<P>The Nature of Cyberspace</P>

<P>The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</P>

<P>1. The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant network
which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer networks.  It
is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one considers what a
linked group of computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what it
does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called "local area
networks").  For example, in many United States Courthouses, computers are
linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging files and messages (and to
share equipment such as printers).  These are networks.</P>

<P>2. Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to other computers or
networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks, which are in
turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each computer in any
network to communicate with computers on any other network in the system.  This
global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to as the Internet.</P>

<P>3. The nature of the Internet is such that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
however, that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.
 In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over 1,000,000 computers
were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers worldwide, of which
approximately 60 percent located within the United States, are estimated to be
linked to the Internet.  This count does not include the personal computers
people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all, reasonable estimates
are that as many as 40 million people around the world can and do access the
enormously flexible communication Internet medium.  That figure is expected to
grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.</P>

<P>4. Some of the computers and computer networks that make up the Internet are
owned by governmental and public institutions, some are owned by non-profit
organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or "cyberspace" -- that links
people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.  The
Internet is an international system.  This communications medium allows any of
the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange
information. These communications can occur almost instantaneously, and can be
directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of people interested
in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.</P>

<P>5. The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
Advanced Research Project Agency ("ARPA"), and was called ARPANET. This network
linked computers and computer networks owned by the military, defense
contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related research. 
The network later allowed researchers across the country to access directly and
to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key universities and
laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in the United
States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the world, the
ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just the "Internet."</P>

<P>6. From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized,
self-maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer
networks, capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system of linked computers was
designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if portions
of the network were damaged, say, in a war.</P>

<P>7. To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global) communications
medium, the ARPANET encouraged the creation of multiple links to and from each
computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated telephone lines) to
other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard. Each of those
computers could in turn be linked to other computers, which themselves would be
linked to other computers.</P>

<P>8. A communication sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message sent from
a computer in Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might
first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a computer
in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City, before finally
reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that path (because of
military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message
would automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be re-routed,
perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then to Atlanta, New Orleans,
Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo Alto.  This type of
transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in a matter of seconds.</P>

<P>9. Messages between computers on the Internet do not necessarily travel entirely
along the same path.  The Internet uses "packet switching" communication
protocols that allow individual messages to be subdivided into smaller "packets"
that are then sent independently to the destination, and are then automatically
reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all packets of a given message
often travel along the same path to the destination, if computers along the
route become overloaded, then packets can be re-routed to less loaded computers.</P>

<P>10. At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it subsequently ceased to
exist), similar networks developed to link universities, research facilities,
businesses, and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. Eventually, each of these
networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked together, allowing
users of any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series of
linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
today commonly known as the Internet.</P>

<P>11. No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
administers the Internet.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact that
hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks
independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange
communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
communications and information with still other computers).  There is no
centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.</P>


<P>How Individuals Access the Internet</P>

<P>12. Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in general,
and the Internet in particular.  In terms of physical access, there are two
common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can use
a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually permanently)
connected to a computer network that is itself directly or indirectly connected
to the Internet. Second, one can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to
connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As detailed below,
both direct and modem connections are made available to people by a wide variety
of academic, governmental, or commercial entities.</P>

<P>13. Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast majority
of colleges and universities in the United States can access the Internet
through their educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices, or computer
centers, or may be through telephone access using a modem from a student's or
professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges and universities
install "ports" or outlets for direct network connections in each dormitory room
or provide access via computers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such
access enables students and professors to use information and content provided
by the college or university itself, and to use the vast amount of research
resources and other information available on the Internet worldwide.</P>

<P>14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are sufficiently important to many
corporations and other employers that those employers link their office computer
networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to
the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be used by,
for example, a corporation involved in scientific or medical research or
manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and ideas
with academic researchers in their fields.</P>

<P>15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through their schools or employers
still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many communities
across the country have established "free-nets" or community networks to provide
their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to provide local-oriented
content and discussion groups).  The first such community network, the Cleveland
Free-Net Community Computer System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now
exist in scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee,
Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego, California. Individuals typically
can access free-nets at little or no cost via modem connection or by using
computers available in community buildings. Free-nets are often operated by a
local library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.</P>

<P>16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through many local libraries.
Libraries often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the Internet.
In addition, some libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.  Increasingly,
patrons now use library services and resources without ever physically entering
the library itself.  Libraries typically provide such direct or modem access at
no cost to the individual user.</P>

<P>17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by patronizing an increasing
number of storefront "computer coffee shops," where customers -- while they
drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the
Internet.  Such Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee.</P>

<P>18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through commercial and
non-commercial "Internet service providers" that typically offer modem telephone
access to a computer or computer network linked to the Internet.  Many such
providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange
Association -- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a monthly or
hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however, are non-profit
organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet.  For
example, the International Internet Association offers free modem access to the
Internet upon request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit associations
offer Internet access as a service to members.</P>

<P>19.  Another common way for individuals to access the Internet is through one of
the major national commercial "online services" such as America Online,
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online services offer
nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized content
within their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing access
to the extensive content available within each online service, the services also
allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained
for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online services have
almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United States.</P>

<P>20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services, individuals
can also access the Internet using some (but not all) of the thousands of local
dial-in computer services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs." 
With an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a telephone line,
individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses can offer
their own dial-in computer "bulletin board" service where friends, members,
subscribers, or customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer (allowing only
one user at a time), to single computers with many telephone lines into the
computer (allowing multiple simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers
each servicing multiple dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous
users).  Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect links
to the Internet. Some BBS systems charge users a nominal fee for access, while
many others are free to the individual users.</P>

<P>21. Although commercial access to the Internet is growing rapidly, many users of
the Internet -- such as college students and staff -- do not individually pay
for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of computer
services is a component of college tuition). These and other Internet users can
access the Internet without paying for such access with a credit card or other
form of payment.</P>


<P>Methods to Communicate Over the Internet</P>

<P>22.  Once one has access to the Internet, there are a wide variety of different
methods of communication and information exchange over the network. These many
methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly evolving and
are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common methods of
communications on the Internet (as well as within the major online services) can
be roughly grouped into six categories:</P>

<P>(1) one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),</P>

<P>(2) one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"),</P>

<P>(3) distributed message databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"),</P>

<P>(4) real time communication (such as "Internet Relay Chat"),</P>

<P>(5) real time remote computer utilization (such as "telnet"), and</P>

<P>(6) remote information retrieval (such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide
Web").</P>

<P>Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmit text, data,
computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e., pictures), and moving video
images.</P>

<P>23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet is via
electronic mail, or "e-mail," comparable in principle to sending a first class
letter. One can address and transmit a message to one or more other people. 
E-mail on the Internet is not routed through a central control point, and can
take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple
e-mail generally is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed on
intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the message is
encrypted).</P>

<P>24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains automatic mailing list
services (such as "listservs"), [also referred to by witnesses as "mail
exploders"] that allow communications about particular subjects of interest to a
group of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a "listserv" mailing list
on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can submit messages
on the topic to the listserv that are forwarded (via e-mail), either
automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to anyone
who has subscribed to the mailing list. A recipient of such a message can reply
to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the mailing
list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of developments or
events in a particular subject area. Most listserv-type mailing lists
automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list subscribers. 
There are thousands of such mailing list services on the Internet, collectively
with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users of "open" listservs typically
can add or remove their names from the mailing list automatically, with no
direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be "closed," i.e., only allowing
for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human moderator.</P>

<P>25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  User-sponsored newsgroups are among the
most popular and widespread applications of Internet services, and cover all
imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups are open
discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need not
subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead access the
database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups are "moderated" but most are open
access.  For the moderated newsgroups,(10) all messages to the newsgroup are
forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the topics under
discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer to peer
connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET "servers")
around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual user with
access to a USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that furnish access to
the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those
servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,
where they are available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time
to make room for new messages.  Responses to messages, like the original
messages, are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the
newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup.  The
dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated
process that does not require direct human intervention or review. 26. There are
newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects.</P>

<P>In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups each day, and
those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
computer networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once the
messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer
networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or computer
networks. Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or "articles") are posted
to newsgroups each day.</P>

<P>27.  Real time communication.  In addition to transmitting messages that can be
later read or accessed, individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate
dialog, in "real time", with other people on the Internet. In its simplest
forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and "Internet Relay Chat" (or
IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each other that almost immediately
appear on the others' computer screens.  IRC is analogous to a telephone party
line, using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone. With IRC, however,
at any one time there are thousands of different party lines available, in which
collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging in conversations on a huge
range of subjects.  Moreover, one can create a new party line to discuss a
different topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are "moderated" or include
"channel operators."</P>

<P>28. In addition, commercial online services such as America Online, CompuServe,
the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systems allowing their
members to converse.</P>

<P>29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another method to use information
on the Internet is to access and control remote computers in "real time" using
"telnet."  For example, using telnet, a researcher at a university would be able
to use the computing power of a supercomputer located at a different university.
 A student can use telnet to connect to a remote library to access the library's
online card catalog program.</P>

<P>30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major category of communication
may be the most well known use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval
of information located on remote computers.  There are three primary methods to
locate and retrieve information on the Internet.</P>

<P>31. A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list the names of
computer files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one or more of
those files to an individual's local computer.</P>

<P>32. Another approach uses a program and format named "gopher" to guide an
individual's search through the resources available on a remote computer.</P>


<P>The World Wide Web</P>

<P>33. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet, is
the "World Wide Web."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language called
hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web can display
HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and moving video.  Any
HTML document can include links to other types of information or resources, so
that while viewing an HTML document that, for example, describes resources
available on the Internet, one can "click" using a computer mouse on the
description of the resource and be immediately connected to the resource itself.
 Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be accessed and organized in very
flexible ways, and allow people to locate and efficiently view related
information even if the information is stored on numerous computers all around
the world.</P>

<P>34. Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform for
a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity of
sources and accessible to Internet users around the world.  Though information
on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each of these
computers is connected to the Internet through W3C protocols allows all of the
information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is currently the
most advanced information system developed on the Internet, and embraces within
its data model most information in previous networked information systems such
as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.</P>

<P>35. History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN, the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted
much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other areas which
depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web has extended beyond
the scientific and academic community to include communications by individuals,
non-profit organizations, and businesses.</P>

<P>36. Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
different computers all over the Internet.  Documents contain information stored
in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An
essential element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather like a
telephone number). Most Web documents contain "links."  These are short sections
of text or image which refer to another document. Typically the linked text is
blue or underlined when displayed, and when selected by the user, the referenced
document is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it actually is
stored.  Links for example are used to lead from overview documents to more
detailed documents, from tables of contents to particular pages, but also as
cross-references, footnotes, and new forms of information structure.</P>

<P>37. Many organizations now have "home pages" on the Web. These are documents
which provide a set of links designed to represent the organization, and through
links from the home page, guide the user directly or indirectly to information
about or relevant to that organization. 38. As an example of the use of links,
if these Findings were to be put on a World Wide Web site, its home page might
contain links such as those:</P>

<P>*  THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE</P>

<P>*  CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE</P>

<P>*  HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET</P>

<P>*  METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET</P>

<P>39. Each of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links may also
take the user from the original Web site to another Web site on another computer
connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to another, from one
document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into a single
body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a
maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.</P>

<P>40. Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform through
which people and organizations can communicate through shared information.  When
information is made available, it is said to be "published" on the Web.
Publishing on the Web simply requires that the "publisher" has a computer
connected to the Internet and that the computer is running W3C server software. 
The computer can be as simple as a small personal computer costing less than
$1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar mainframe computer.  Many
Web publishers choose instead to lease disk storage space from someone else who
has the necessary computer facilities, eliminating the need for actually owning
any equipment oneself.</P>

<P>41. The Web, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a variety
of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the hastily typed
idea, to the professionally executed corporate profile.  The power of the Web
stems from the ability of a link to point to any document, regardless of its
status or physical location.</P>

<P>42. Information to be published on the Web must also be formatted according to
the rules of the Web standards. These standardized formats assure that all Web
users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web standards are
sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet the publishing
needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses, newspapers and
magazines which now publish "online" editions of their material, as well as
government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web to disseminate
information to the public. At the same time, Web publishing is simple enough
that thousands of individual users and small community organizations are using
the Web to publish their own personal "home pages," the equivalent of
individualized newsletters about that person or organization, which are
available to everyone on the Web.</P>

<P>43. Web publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
pool of all Internet users, or close them, thus making the information
accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to
keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case of
Web sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access will only be
allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.(11)</P>

<P>44. Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have developed that allow users of
the Web to search particular information among all of the public sites that are
part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler, and
Lycos are all services known as "search engines" which allow users to search for
Web sites that contain certain categories of information, or to search for key
words.  For example, a Web user looking for the text of Supreme Court opinions
would type the words "Supreme Court" into a search engine, and then be presented
with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain Supreme Court information. 
This list would actually be a series of links to those sites.  Having searched
out a number of sites that might contain the desired information, the user would
then follow individual links, browsing through the information on each site,
until the desired material is found.  For many content providers on the Web, the
ability to be found by these search engines is very important.</P>

<P>45. Common standards.  The Web links together disparate information on an
ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information
storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic Web standards
provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and exchange of
information.  Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on the Web,
and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise incompatible, those who
"publish" information on the Web are able to communicate with those who seek to
access information with little difficulty because of these basic technical
standards.</P>

<P>46. A distributed system with no centralized control. Running on tens of
thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the Web is what is known as a
distributed system. The Web was designed so that organizations with computers
containing information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Web software.  No
single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any single
centralized point from which individual Web sites or services can be blocked
from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control point.</P>

<P>47. Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed, decentralized
nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that have come
before it. Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis, and
Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed from
the Internet with the appropriate passwords and access software.  However, these
databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is the World Wide Web.</P>

<P>48. Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities. The
World Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web environment makes it
easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
token, the open nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer each
potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.</P>


<P>Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material(12)</P>

<P>PICS</P>

<P>49. With the rapid growth of the Internet, the increasing popularity of the Web,
and the existence of material online that some parents may consider
inappropriate for their children, various entities have begun to build systems
intended to enable parents to control the material which comes into their homes
and may be accessible to their children.  The World Wide Web Consortium launched
the PICS ("Platform for Internet Content Selection") program in order to develop
technical standards that would support parents' ability to filter and screen
material that their children see on the Web.</P>

<P>50. The Consortium intends that PICS will provide the ability for third parties,
as well as individual content providers, to rate content on the Internet in a
variety of ways.  When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World Wide Web
browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications, will
provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating services, or a
combination of services.</P>

<P>51. PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants include many of the major online
services providers, commercial internet access providers, hardware and software
companies, major internet content providers, and consumer organizations. Among
active participants in the PICS effort are:</P>

<P>Adobe Systems, Inc. Apple Computer America Online AT&T Center for Democracy and
Technology CompuServe Delphi Internet Services Digital Equipment Corporation IBM
First floor First Virtual Holdings Incorporated France Telecom FTP Software
Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan Information Technology
Association of America Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en
Automatique (INRIA) Interactive Services Association MCI Microsoft MIT/LCS/World
Wide Web Consortium NCD NEC Netscape Communications Corporation NewView O'Reilly
and Associates Open Market Prodigy Services Company Progressive Networks
Providence Systems/Parental Guidance Recreational Software Advisory Council
SafeSurf SoftQuad, Inc. Songline Studios Spyglass SurfWatch Software Telequip
Corp. Time Warner Pathfinder Viacom Nickelodeon(13)</P>

<P>52. Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies from
the computer, communications, and content industries, as well as trade
associations and public interest groups.  PICS technical specifications have
been agreed to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products and
services based on the PICS-standards.</P>

<P>53. Until a majority of sites on the Internet have been rated by a PICS rating
service, PICS will initially function as a "positive" ratings system in which
only those sites that have been rated will be displayed using PICS compatible
software.  In other words, PICS will initially function as a site inclusion list
rather than a site exclusion list.  The default configuration for a PICS
compatible Internet application will be to block access to all sites which have
not been rated by a PICS rating service, while allowing access to sites which
have a PICS rating for appropriate content.(14)</P>


<P>Software</P>

<P>54. For over a year, various companies have marketed stand alone software that
is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet access of
children.  Examples of such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The
Internet Filter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy Server,
and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software is growing, and there is
increasing competition among software providers to provide products.</P>


<P>Cyber Patrol</P>

<P>55. As more people, particularly children, began to use the Internet,
Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to develop and market Internet software
intended to empower parents to exercise individual choice over what material
their children could access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop a
product which would give parents comfort that their children can reap the
benefits of the Internet while shielding them from objectionable or otherwise
inappropriate materials based on the parents' own particular tastes and values.
Microsystems' product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.</P>

<P>56. Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995, and is currently available
in Windows and Macintosh versions. Cyber Patrol works with both direct Internet
Access providers (ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and Commercial Online Service
Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy, Microsoft).  Cyber Patrol
is also compatible with all major World Wide Web browsers on the market (e.g.,
Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic, Prodigy's Legacy and Skimmer browsers, America
Online, Netcom's NetCruiser, etc.). Cyber Patrol was the first parental
empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS standard.  In February of
1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratings server on the Internet.</P>

<P>57. The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000 sites in twelve categories. 
The software is designed to enable parents to selectively block access to any or
all of the twelve CyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes in the Cyber
Patrol Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  These categories are:</P>

<P>Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or emotional acts against any
animal or person which are primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses George Carlin's seven
censored words more often than once every fifty messages or pages.</P>

<P>Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human anatomy except when
exposing genitalia.</P>

<P>Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.</P>

<P>Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text exposing anyone or anything
involved in explicit sexual acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and involving nude or partially
nude people in heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual encounters.  Also
includes phone sex ads, dating services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.</P>

<P>Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or descriptive text of anyone or
anything which are crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or showing
scatological impropriety.  Includes such depictions as maiming, bloody figures,
indecent depiction of bodily functions.</P>

<P>Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination against any race or
ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one
race over another.</P>

<P>Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil, wickedness.  Sects or
groups that potentially coerce individuals to grow, and keep, membership.</P>

<P>Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of illegal drugs for
entertainment.  This would exclude current illegal drugs used for medicinal
purposes (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes substances used
for other than their primary purpose to alter the individual's state of mind
such as glue sniffing.</P>

<P>Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative behaviors, radicalism,
advocacy of extreme political measures.  Topics include extreme political groups
that advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.</P>

<P>Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos, betting, numbers games, on-line
sports or financial betting including non-monetary dares.</P>

<P>Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a dubious nature which may be
illegal in any or all jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.</P>

<P>Alcohol, Beer & Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale or consumption of
alcoholic beverages.  Also includes sites and information relating to tobacco
products.</P>

<P>58. Microsystems employs people to search the Internet for sites containing
material in these categories.  Since new sites are constantly coming online,
Microsystems updates the CyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the
home PC, the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to the CyberNOT
list over the Internet every seven days.</P>

<P>59. In February of 1996, Microsystems signed a licensing arrangement with
CompuServe, one of the leading commercial online services with over 4.3 million
subscribers. CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to its subscribers.
 Microsystems the same month signed a licensing arrangement with Prodigy,
another leading commercial online service with over 1.4 million subscribers. 
Prodigy will provide Cyber Patrol free of charge of its subscribers.</P>

<P>60. Cyber Patrol is also available directly from Microsystems for $49.95, which
includes a six month subscription to the CyberNOT blocked sites list (updated
automatically once every seven days).  After six months, parents can receive six
months of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for $29.95.  Cyber
Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of Cyber Patrol, is available free of
charge on the Internet.  To obtain either version, parents download a seven day
demonstration version of the full Cyber Patrol product from the Microsystems
Internet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven day trial period, users
are offered the opportunity to purchase the complete version of Cyber Patrol or
provide Microsystems some basic demographic information in exchange for
unlimited use of the Home Edition.  The demographic information is used for
marketing and research purposes. Since January of 1996, over 10,000
demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloaded from Microsystems' Web
site.</P>

<P>61. Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outlets as NetBlocker Plus.
NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, which includes five weeks of updates to the
CyberNOT list.</P>

<P>62. Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into a growing market in schools. As
more classrooms become connected to the Internet, many teachers want to ensure
that their students can receive the benefit of the Internet without encountering
material they deem educationally inappropriate.</P>

<P>63. Microsystems is working with the Recreational Software Advisory Council
(RSAC), a non-profit corporation which developed rating systems for video games,
to implement the RSAC rating system for the Internet.</P>

<P>64. The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected in second quarter of this year,
will give parents the ability to use any PICS rating service, including the RSAC
rating service, in addition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.</P>

<P>65. In order to speed the implementation of PICS and encourage the development
of PICS-compatible Internet applications, Microsystems maintains a server on the
Internet which contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides software
developers with access to a PICS rating service, and allows software developers
to test their products' ability to interpret standard PICS labels. Microsystems
is also offering its PICS client test program for Windows free of charge.  The
client program can be used by developers of PICS rating services to test their
services and products.</P>


<P>SurfWatch</P>

<P>66. Another software product, SurfWatch, is also designed to allow parents and
other concerned users to filter unwanted material on the Internet. SurfWatch is
available for both Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Windows 95
Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet Access Providers (e.g.,
Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&T, and more than 1000 other Internet Service Providers).</P>

<P>67. The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Software is $49.95, with a street
price of between $20.00 and $25.00. The product is also available as part of
CompuServe/Spry Inc.'s Internet in a Box for Kids, which includes access to
Spry's Kids only Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch. Internet in a Box for
Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscription service, which updates
the SurfWatch blocked site list automatically with new sites each month, is
available for $5.95 per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is included
as part of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is also provided as a
low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.</P>

<P>68. SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including National
stores such as Comp USA, Egghead Software, Computer City, and several national
mail order outlets.  SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its own site on
the World Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.</P>

<P>69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), Microsoft Network, and Prodigy all offer
parental control options free of charge to their members.  AOL has established
an online area designed specifically for children.  The "Kids Only" parental
control feature allows parents to establish an AOL account for their children
that accesses only the Kids Only channel on America Online.(15)</P>

<P>70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatible capability into its standard Web
browser software, and to make available to subscribers other PICS-compatible Web
browsers, such as the Netscape software.</P>

<P>71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give their subscribers the option of
blocking all access to the Internet, or to particular media within their
proprietary online content, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms.</P>

<P>72. Although parental control software currently can screen for certain
suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it cannot now screen for
sexually explicit images unaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who
configure the software are aware of the particular site.</P>

<P>73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software suggests
that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their children
from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is
inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.</P>


<P>Content on the Internet</P>

<P>74. The types of content now on the Internet defy easy classification.  The
entire card catalogue of the Carnegie Library is on-line, together with
journals, journal abstracts, popular magazines, and titles of compact discs. The
director of the Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-line
services are the emerging trend in libraries generally.  Plaintiff Hotwired
Ventures LLC organizes its Web site into information regarding travel, news and
commentary, arts and entertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff
America Online, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety of topics,
but also allows members to create their own chat rooms to suit their own tastes.
 The ACLU uses an America Online chat room as an unmoderated forum for people to
debate civil liberties issues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,(16) estimated
that 15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interest in a
newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  America Online makes 15,000
bulletin boards available to its subscribers, who post between 200,000 and
250,000 messages each day.  Another plaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold,
participates in "virtual communities" that simulate social interaction.  It is
no exaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet is as diverse as
human thought.</P>

<P>75. The Internet is not exclusively, or even primarily, a means of commercial
communication.  Many commercial entities maintain Web sites to inform potential
consumers about their goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but many
other Web sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercial
information.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-mail, bulletin
boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequently have non-commercial goals.  For
the economic and technical reasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the
Internet is an especially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or public
interest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There are examples in the
parties' stipulation of some of the non-commercial uses that the Internet
serves.  Plaintiff Human Rights Watch, Inc., offers information on its Internet
site regarding reported human rights abuses around the world.  Plaintiff
National Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues of concern to
them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text, graphics, and statistics
regarding the incidence and prevention of rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical
Path AIDS Project, Inc., offers information on safer sex, the transmission of
HIV, and the treatment of AIDS.</P>

<P>76. Such diversity of content on the Internet is possible because the Internet
provides an easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large audience,
potentially of millions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed by
communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those associated with
use of other forms of mass communication, such as television, radio, newspapers,
and magazines.  This enables operation of their own Web sites not only by large
companies, such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit
groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS Project.  The
Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,(17) agreed that creation of a Web site
would cost between $1,000 and $15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on
one's goals and the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as
America Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free of charge.  Any
Internet user can communicate by posting a message to one of the thousands of
newsgroups and bulletin boards or by engaging in an on-line "chat", and thereby
reach an audience worldwide that shares an interest in a particular topic.</P>

<P>77.  The ease of communication through the Internet is facilitated by the use of
hypertext markup language (HTML), which allows for the creation of "hyperlinks"
or "links". HTML enables a user to jump from one source to other related sources
by clicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web site to Web site,
or to other files within a particular Web site.  Similarly, by typing a request
into a search engine, a user can retrieve many different sources of content
related to the search that the creators of the engine have collected.</P>

<P>78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet, the statutory term
"content provider,"(18) which is equivalent to the traditional "speaker," may
actually be a hybrid of speakers.  Through the use of HTML, for example,
Critical Path and Stop Prisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related
databases, and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of these
organizations to the related databases simply by clicking on a link.  America
Online creates chat rooms for particular discussions but also allows subscribers
to create their own chat rooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a
particular topic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Users of
the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fair and Playboy, and
America Online's subscribers can peruse the New York Times, Boating, and other
periodicals. Critical Path, Stop Prisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie
Library all make available content of other speakers over whom they have little
or no editorial control.</P>

<P>79.  Because of the different forms of Internet communication, a user of the
Internet may speak or listen interchangeably, blurring the distinction between
"speakers" and "listeners" on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroups
are interactive forms of communication, providing the user with the opportunity
both to speak and to listen.</P>

<P>80. It follows that unlike traditional media, the barriers to entry as a speaker
on the Internet do not differ significantly from the barriers to entry as a
listener. Once one has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue that
occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and does become the
content provider, and vice-versa.</P>

<P>81. The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human
communication.</P>


<P>Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet</P>

<P>82. The parties agree that sexually explicit material exists on the Internet. 
Such material includes text, pictures, and chat, and includes bulletin boards,
newsgroups, and the other forms of Internet communication, and extends from the
modestly titillating to the hardest-core.</P>

<P>83. There is no evidence that sexually-oriented material is the primary type of
content on this new medium.  Purveyors of such material take advantage of the
same ease of access available to all users of the Internet, including
establishment of a Web site.</P>

<P>84. Sexually explicit material is created, named, and posted in the same manner
as material that is not sexually explicit.  It is possible that a search engine
can accidentally retrieve material of a sexual nature through an imprecise
search, as demonstrated at the hearing. Imprecise searches may also retrieve
irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  The accidental retrieval of
sexually explicit material is one manifestation of the larger phenomenon of
irrelevant search results.</P>

<P>85. Once a provider posts content on the Internet, it is available to all other
Internet users worldwide. Similarly, once a user posts a message to a newsgroup
or bulletin board, that message becomes available to all subscribers to that
newsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when the UCR/California Museum of
Photography posts to its Web site nudes by Edward Weston and Robert Mapplethorpe
to announce that its new exhibit will travel to Baltimore and New York City,
those images are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and New York
City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- wherever Internet users
live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to its Web
site, written in street language so that the teenage receiver can understand
them, are available not just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and Prague.  A
chat room organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States Supreme Court's 
decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit George Carlin's seven
dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages posted to a newsgroup dedicated to
the Oklahoma City bombing travel to all subscribers to that newsgroup.</P>

<P>86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet, it cannot prevent that
content from entering any community. Unlike the newspaper, broadcast station, or
cable system, Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a potential
worldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network of networks (as described
above in Findings 1 through 4), any network connected to the Internet has the
capacity to send and receive information to any other network.  Hotwired
Ventures, for example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.</P>

<P>87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunction hearings showed that it takes
several steps to enter cyberspace.  At the most fundamental level, a user must
have access to a computer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically by
way of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect with the
access provider, enter a password, and enter the appropriate commands to find
particular data.  On the World Wide Web, a user must normally use a search
engine or enter an appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups,
bulletin boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.</P>

<P>88. Communications over the Internet do not "invade" an individual's home or
appear on one's computer screen unbidden.  Users seldom encounter content "by
accident." A document's title or a description of the document will usually
appear before the document itself takes the step needed to view it, and in many
cases the user will receive detailed information about a site's content before
he or she need take the step to access the document.  Almost all sexually
explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the content.  Even the
Government's witness, Agent Howard Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of
Special Investigation, testified that the "odds are slim" that a user would come
across a sexually explicit site by accident.</P>

<P>89. Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant differences between
Internet communications and communications received by radio or television.
Although content on the Internet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the
user,  the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.  A
child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material
and thereby to use the Internet unattended.</P>


<P>Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet</P>

<P>90.  There is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a user
who is accessing material through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat
rooms.  An e-mail address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail "alias" or an anonymous remailer. There is also
no universal or reliable listing of e-mail addresses and corresponding names or
telephone numbers, and any such listing would be or rapidly become incomplete. 
For these reasons, there is no reliable way in many instances for a sender to
know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor. The difficulty of e-mail
age verification is compounded for mail exploders such as listservs, which
automatically send information to all e-mail addresses on a sender's list. 
Government expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a
speaker assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail exploder's
mailing list.</P>

<P>91.  Because of similar technological difficulties, individuals posting a
message to a newsgroup or engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that
all readers are adults, and Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are
moderated, the moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.</P>

<P>92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to ensure
that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age. The
Government presented no evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its suggestion
that chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material deemed indecent
could be effectively segregated to "adult" or "moderated" areas of cyberspace.</P>

<P>93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block minors' access to
newsgroups and similar fora, there is no method by which the creators of
newsgroups which contain discussions of art, politics or any other subject that
could potentially elicit "indecent" contributions could limit the blocking of
access by minors to such "indecent" material and still allow them access to the
remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of that content was not
indecent.</P>

<P>94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and  MUSEs (Multi-User
Simulation Environments) do not know whether the other participants are adults
or minors. Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their age, and there
is no current technology to enable the administrator of these fantasy worlds to
know if the participant is an adult or a minor.</P>

<P>95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the Internet, there is technology by
which an operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a user of a Web
site.  An HTML document can include a fill-in-the-blank "form" to request
information from a visitor to a Web site, and this information can be
transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by a computer program,
usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi) script.  The Web server could then
grant or deny access to the information sought.  The cgi script is the means by
which a Web site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit card number or adult password.</P>

<P>96.  Content providers who publish on the World Wide Web via one of the large
commercial online services, such as America Online or CompuServe, could not use
an online age verification system that requires cgi script because the server
software of these online services available to subscribers cannot process cgi
scripts.  There is no method currently available for Web page publishers who
lack access to cgi scripts to screen recipients online for age.</P>


<P>The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses</P>

<P>Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes available three potential defenses
to all content providers on the Internet:  credit card verification, adult
verification by password or adult identification number, and "tagging".</P>


<P>Credit Card Verification</P>

<P>97.  Verification(19) of a credit card number over the Internet is not now
technically possible.  Witnesses testified that neither Visa nor Mastercard
considers the Internet to be sufficiently secure under the current technology to
process transactions in that manner. Although users can and do purchase products
over the Internet by transmitting their credit card number, the seller must then
process the transaction with Visa or Mastercard off-line using phone lines in
the traditional way.  There was testimony by several witnesses that Visa and
Mastercard are in the process of developing means of credit card verification
over the Internet.</P>

<P>98. Verification by credit card, if and when operational, will remain
economically and practically unavailable for many of the non-commercial
plaintiffs in these actions. The Government's expert "suspect[ed]" that
verification agencies would decline to process a card unless it accompanied a
commercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.</P>

<P>99. There was evidence that the fee charged by verification agencies to process
a card, whether for a purchase or not, will preclude use of the credit-card
verification defense by many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites, and there was
no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell Warren, an
author whose free Web site allows users to purchase gay and lesbian literature,
testified that she must pay $1 per verification to a verification agency.  Her
Web site can absorb this cost because it arises in connection with the sale of
books available there.</P>

<P>100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for age, and requiring use of a
credit card to enter a site, would impose a significant economic cost on
non-commercial entities.  Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily
from February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay a fee every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.  The ACLU's Barry Steinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit
card verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site would require
it to shut down its Web site because the projected cost would exceed its budget.</P>

<P>101. Credit card verification would significantly delay the retrieval of
information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, the expert testifying for the
Government, agreed that even "a minute is [an] absolutely unreasonable [delay] .
. . [P]eople will not put up with a minute."  Plaintiffs' expert Donna Hoffman
similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the "flow" on the Internet and
stifles both "hedonistic" and "goal-directed" browsing.</P>

<P>102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement would completely bar adults who do
not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any
blocked material.  At this time, credit card verification is effectively
unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as a potential
defense to the CDA.</P>


<P>Adult Verification by Password</P>

<P>103.  The Government offered very limited evidence regarding the operation of
existing age verification systems, and the evidence offered was not based on
personal knowledge.  AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be
used for accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users for their
services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of these services was derived
primarily from reading the advertisements on their Web pages.  He had not
interviewed any employees of these entities, had not personally used these
systems, had no idea how many people are registered with them, and could not
testify to the reliability of their attempt at age verification. 104.  At least
some, if not almost all, non-commercial organizations, such as the ACLU, Stop
Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard charging listeners to access
their speech as contrary to their goals of making their materials available to a
wide audience free of charge.</P>

<P>105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercial organizations to design
their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative burden
of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved is
beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be prohibitive
even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the online version of Wired
magazine.</P>

<P>106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required use of
a credit card or password.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received
many complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system, which
requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address and self-created
password. There is concern by commercial content providers that age verification
requirements would decrease advertising and revenue because advertisers depend
on a demonstration that the sites are widely available and frequently visited.</P>

<P>107.  Even if credit card verification or adult password verification were
implemented, the Government presented no testimony as to how such systems could
ensure that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The
burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification
systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet
content providers.</P>


<P>The Government's "Tagging" Proposal</P>

<P>108. The feasibility and effectiveness of "tagging" to restrict children from
accessing "indecent" speech, as proposed by the Government has not been
established. "Tagging" would require content providers to label all of their
"indecent" or "patently offensive" material by imbedding a string of characters,
such as "XXX," in either the URL or HTML.  If a user could install software on
his or her computer to recognize the "XXX" tag, the user could screen out any
content with that tag.  Dr. Olsen proposed a "-L18" tag, an idea he developed
for this hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that certain
tagging would not be feasible.</P>

<P>109. The parties appear to agree that it is technologically feasible --
"trivial", in the words of plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML,
and the technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposal and the
Government's "-L18" proposal.</P>

<P>110. The Government's tagging proposal would require all content providers that
post arguably "indecent" material to review all of their online content, a task
that would be extremely burdensome for organizations that provide large amounts
of material online which cannot afford to pay a large staff to review all of
that material.  The Carnegie Library would be required to hire numerous
additional employees to review its on-line files at an extremely high cost to
its limited budget.  The cost and effort would be substantial for the Library
and frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya testified that
it would be impossible for his organization, Critical Path, to review all of its
material because it has only one full and one part-time employee.</P>

<P>111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done simply by using software
which screens for certain words, as Dr. Olsen acknowledged, and we find that
determinations as to what is indecent require human judgment.</P>

<P>112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a content provider could tag
its entire site but this would prevent minors from accessing much material that
is not "indecent" under the CDA.</P>

<P>113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18 proposal would require a
worldwide consensus among speakers to use the same tag to label "indecent"
material.  There is currently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker
currently labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other
widely-recognized label.</P>

<P>114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software that recognizes the tags and
takes appropriate action when it notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial Web
browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block a
-L18 code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internet will continue
to travel to whomever requests it, without hindrance.  Labelling speech has no
effect in itself on the transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither
plaintiffs nor the Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors
from speech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under the CDA. It
follows that all speech on any topic that is available to adults will also be
available to children using the Internet (unless it is blocked by screening
software running on the computer the child is using).</P>

<P>115. There is no way that a speaker can use current technology to know if a
listener is using screening software.</P>

<P>116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate themselves depending on the
age or location of the receiver.  Critical Path, which posts on-line safer sex
instructions, would be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in
communities where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, for example,
must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech in all communities) or
not to tag, blocking its speech in none.</P>


<P>The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching</P>

<P>117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of content on the Internet
originates outside the United States.  At the hearing, a witness demonstrated
how an Internet user could access a Web site of London (which presumably is on a
server in England), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  A user
can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from overseas, since
InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed a country code in a domain name.(20)
 Foreign content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content (as long
as it is in English), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted in the
same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that foreign speech
contain a country code in its URL.  It is undisputed that some foreign speech
that travels over the Internet is sexually explicit.</P>

<P>118. The use of "caching" makes it difficult to determine whether the material
originated from foreign or domestic sources.  Because of the high cost of using
the trans- Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high demand on
those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often "cached", or
temporarily stored, on servers in the United States.  Material from a foreign
source in Europe can travel over the trans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the
United States, and pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a
copy for subsequent retrieval. This domestic caching server, rather than the
original foreign server, will send the material from the cache to the subsequent
receivers, without placing a demand on the trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut
effectively eliminates most of the distance for both the request and the
information and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a certain time or
as the demand for the information diminishes).  Caching therefore advances core
Internet values:  the cheap and speedy retrieval of information.</P>

<P>119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon. Domestic content
providers store popular domestic material on their caching servers to avoid the
delay of successive searches for the same material and to decrease the demand on
their Internet connection.  America Online can cache the home page of the New
York Times on its servers when a subscriber first requests it, so that
subsequent subscribers who make the same request will receive the same home
page, but from America Online's caching service rather than from the New York
Times's server.(21)</P>

<P>120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior paragraph, America Online
has no control over the content that the New York Times posts to its Web site,
and the New York Times has no control over America Online's distribution of that
content from a caching server.</P>


<P>Anonymity</P>

<P>121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek to access sensitive
information, such as users of the Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, the
users, particularly gay youth, of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop
Prisoner Rape (SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.</P>


<P>Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA</P>

<P>122. Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on the Internet must
choose between silence and the risk of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses --
credit card verification, adult access codes, and adult personal identification
numbers -- are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.</P>

<P>123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses, libraries, non-commercial
and not-for-profit organizations, and educational societies and consortia. 
Although some of the material that plaintiffs post online -- such as information
regarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape -- is sexually
explicit and may be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some
communities, none of the plaintiffs is a commercial purveyor of what is commonly
termed "pornography."</P>


<P>III.</P>

<P><H3>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</H3></P>

<P>Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability of eventual success in the
litigation by demonstrating that Sections 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of the CDA
are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach indecency. 
Sections 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face. 
Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no party has any interest
in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and therefore the public interest
will be served by granting the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.
347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493
U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994). 
The motions for preliminary injunction will therefore be granted.</P>

<P>(5)The Act does not define "telecommunications device".  By Order dated February
27, 1996, we asked the parties to address whether a modem is a
"telecommunications device". Plaintiffs and the Government answered in the
affirmative, and we agree that the plain meaning of the phrase and the
legislative history of the Act strongly support their conclusion. 
"Telecommunications" under 47 U.S.C. Section 153(48) means "the transmission,
between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user's
choosing, without change in the form of content of the information as sent and
received."  The plain meaning of "device" is "something that is formed or
formulated by design and usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives,
experiment, and testing."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 618
(1986). Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought it would reach individual
Internet users, many of whom still connect through modems. See, e.g., 141 Cong.
Rec. S8329-46 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen.
Coats).</P>

<P>The resolution of the tension between the scope of "telecommunications device"
and the scope of "interactive computer service" as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section
230(a)(2), see infra note 6, must await another day.  It is sufficient for us to
conclude that the exclusion of Section 223(h)(1)(B) is probably a narrow one (as
the Government has argued), insulating an interactive computer service from
criminal liability under the CDA but not insulating users who traffic in
indecent and patently offensive materials on the Internet through those
services.</P>

<P>(6)The statute at Section 509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add Section 230(e)(2), which
defines such a service as "any information service, system, or access software
provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access
to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or
educational institutions."</P>

<P>(7)In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes "the Department has a
longstanding policy that previous such provisions are unconstitutional and will
not be enforced", and that both President Clinton and General Reno "have made
th[e] point clear" that no one will be prosecuted under "the abortion-related
provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c)." Opposition at 19, n.11
(February 14, 1996).  In view of this "longstanding policy", the Government
contends there is no realistic fear of prosecution and, so the argument goes, no
need for equitable relief.  Id.  In their post-hearing brief, the ACLU
plaintiffs inform us that in view of the Government's statement, "they do not
seek a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Section 1462(c)." 
Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs at 2 n.2.</P>

<P>(8)The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties for their
cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.</P>

<P>(9)The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff in
either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own on that point, notwithstanding
the Government's suggestion in a footnote of its post-hearing brief.  See
Defendants' Post-Hearing Memorandum at 37 n.46 ("Plaintiffs' assertions as to
the speech at issue are so off-point as to raise standing concerns."). 
Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature and content of the
speech they contend is or may be affected by the CDA, are set forth in
paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30 through 103 of the parties' stipulation
filed in these actions.  These paragraphs will not be reproduced here, but will
be deemed adopted as Findings of the court.</P>

<P>(10)It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups are the
exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.</P>

<P>(11)The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this paragraph of
the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.</P>

<P>(12)Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces exist to limit
the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate for
their children. Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of so-called
"parental empowerment" software, there is a sufficiently wide zone of agreement
on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites that the parties were
able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated facts on the subject,
which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our Findings of fact. 
Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some of the technological
facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the time of publication of
these Findings.</P>

<P>(13)This membership is constantly growing, according to the testimony of Albert
Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium.  See also Defendants' Ex.
D-167.</P>

<P>(14)See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr. Vezza.</P>

<P>(15) From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer based upon the
parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced at the hearings.</P>

<P>(16)Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the group
primarily responsible for Internet technical standards, as well as other
Internet-related associations responsible for, among other things, the
prevailing Internet Protocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.</P>

<P>(17)Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University
in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointed Director of the Human Computer
Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P>(18)The term "information content provider" is defined in Section 509 of the
CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C. Section 230(e)(3), as "any person or entity that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information
provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service."</P>

<P>(19)By "verification", we mean the method by which a user types in his or her
credit card number, and the Web site ensures that the credit card is valid
before it allows the user to enter the site.</P>

<P>(20)InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of content.  InterNIC and
two other European organizations maintain a master list of domain names to
ensure that no duplication occurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their
domain name with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web site has the name of an already-existing site.
InterNIC has no control over content on a site after registration.</P>

<P>(21)This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustrate that a content
provider might store its own material or someone else's on a caching server. 
The goal -- saving money and time -- is the same in both cases.</P>

<html><TITLE>Spotlight -  Report on Senator Packwood</TITLE><body><center><P><hr size=7>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys. LCC is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<P><hr size=7><p></center>     <H4> 3.  Testimony of James Fitzpatrick</H4><p> <p>     In order to confirm information provided by Senator Packwood at his deposition about requests that his attorneys had made for his diaries, and Senator Packwood's transmittal of diaries to his attorneys, the staff took the deposition of James Fitzpatrick of Arnold &amp; Porter.  Arnold &amp; Porter represented Senator Packwood from late 1992 up until shortly before the hearing before Judge Jackson in December 1993; they terminated their representation on November 22, 1993.  Also present at the deposition were Jacob Stein and Robert Muse, Senator Packwood's current attorneys, who were in attendance solely to raise objections, if necessary, to questions that implicated the attorney-client privilege.  Mr. Fitzpatrick was represented by Stephen Sacks, an attorney at Arnold &amp; Porter.<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that Arnold &amp; Porter began providing legal representation to Senator Packwood in the late fall of 1992, after the general election.  This representation continued to November 22, 1993.<p> <p>          a.   Requests for Information from Senator Packwood<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that from the beginning, they were asking Senator Packwood to provide information and facts that might help them to prepare his defense.  He does not specifically recall asking Senator Packwood to provide diary entries relating to allegations then under consideration, either sexual misconduct or intimidation of witnesses.  Rather, they made requests for information from a broad variety of sources, and they received information from Senator Packwood from a broad variety of sources, including diary material, clippings, memoranda, and recollections.<p> <p>     The attorneys at Arnold &amp; Porter were aware that Senator Packwood kept diaries.  Along the way, they received material from him that either referred to or summarized the diaries, and in some instances contained specific excerpts from the diaries. Mr. Fitzpatrick did not know the precise date when they first received any memoranda containing excerpts or entries from the diaries, although it would have been sometime in 1993.  Although he did not have an independent recollection of the particular date that any document was received from Senator Packwood, he stated that the privilege log provided to the Committee on August 3. 1993. would reflect any documents that they received from Senator Packwood, but which were withheld from the Committee on the grounds of privilege.[fn 147]<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick did not recall any specific conversation directing the Senator to review his diaries to look for entries that might relate to the intimidation issue.  As they tried to master the facts, they did ask the Senator for any information that might be relevant to the charges, instructing him broadly to provide information that would be helpful.  There may have been a conversation dealing with diaries.<p> <p>     Among the materials that they received from Senator Packwood during the course of 1993, there were some references to the October to November 1992 time period, although he did not know when the particular memo discussing this time period was provided to them.<p> <p>     After some discussion among Senator Packwood's former and current attorneys, it was represented by Mr. Sacks that the first memorandum that was provided to Arnold &amp; Porter, attaching diary entries or excerpts, was dated January 7, 1993, and that the entries covered the period of October to November 1992.<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that some of the diary entries excerpted or discussed in the memoranda provided to them by Senator Packwood might have included the names of women who were making allegations of sexual misconduct against Senator Packwood, although he recalled that there was no reference in the diaries to any incident that had been alleged.<p> <p>     b.   Failure to Provide Relevant Diary Entries to the Committee<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick was asked whether Arnold 6 Porter had provided any diary entries to the Committee in responding to the Committee's two document requests on behalf of Senator Packwood. He stated that they responded in good faith to the requests, supplying material that was responsive to the requests, and that any material that was called for that they did not produce was identified on the privilege log.[fn 148]  At different times in his deposition, he stated that the diary entries that contained references to women who had made claims of sexual misconduct were both outside the scope of the Committee's request, and within the scope of the Committee's request, but subject to a privilege. He testified that to the extent that the material might have been responsive to the request, but protected by a privilege, it was noted on the privilege log. He would not concede that the fact that the privilege log sets out memoranda that incorporated diary entries means that Arnold &amp; Porter made a judgment that the diary entries were within the scope of the Committee's request.<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that not all of the 112 items identified on the privilege log related to diary excerpts, but they were a wide range of memoranda, some having nothing to do with the diaries.<p> <p>     c.   Receipt of Diary Transcripts from Senator Packwood<p> <p>      On October 7, 1993, Arnold &amp; Porter received from Senator Packwood a series of volumes in black notebooks, purporting to be the diaries from 1969 through part of 1992.  They were kept locked in Arnold &amp; Porter's offices. They reviewed the diaries, masked them for review by Committee staff, and provided them for review in the presence of an Arnold &amp; Porter representative until the reviewing agreement broke down.<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that Arnold &amp; Porter continued to receive additional transcripts after October 7, 1993.  Mr. Fitzpatrick believes that they then asked Senator Packwood to bring his diaries up to date for the Committee's review.  After a discussion between Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Sacks, Mr. Muse, and Mr. Stein, Mr. Sacks represented that Arnold &amp; Porter requested that Senator Packwood transcribe his diaries some time in July or August of 1993, as best as they could ascertain.  However, Mr. Fitzpatrick himself could not recall asking Senator Packwood to have the remainder of his diaries transcribed at that time.  Mr. Sacks represented that that was the recollection of one of the attorneys in the group who was in communication with the Senator's office:  Dan Rezneck, Mike Korens, Leigh McAfee, and possibly others. He had no idea who specifically made such a request on any given date, but it "sounds right" to all of them that the request to have the 1992 and 1993 diaries transcribed was made in the July-August time period.[fn 149]<p> <p>     Later in his deposition, Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that they received transcribed diary pages in addition to the material in the binders that they received on October 7, including entries from 1992, but he does not recall when they received those pages, or even whether they were received before or after Senator Packwood's deposition, or before or after the delivery of the binders on October 7.  He does know that some time during the period after October 7, they received additional pages dealing with 1992 and 1993, although he could not give a precise date. But he could not recall if they got this material before or after they received the binders.<p> <p>     Mr. Sacks stated that the first diary information Arnold &amp; Porter received was on October 7, which covered 1969 through part of 1992. Thereafter, additional information from the diaries was provided for the remainder of 1992 and portions of 1993.<p> <p>     Mr. Fitzpatrick recalled that all of the diary pages they received on October 7 were numbered, but he did not recall whether the pages received after that date were.[fn 150]<p> <p>     On October 31, 1993, Senator Packwood took back the volumes for 1989 and 1990.  On November 5, he returned these volumes, and took the volumes from 1991.  On November 6, he returned the 1991 volumes, and took the 1992 volumes, which he returned on November 9.<p> <p>          d.   Receipt of Diary Tapes from Senator Packwood<p> <p>     Arnold &amp; Porter received the original tapes of the previously transcribed diaries on November 22, 1993.  These tapes covered a time period starting in 1969, and going forward, although Mr. Fitzpatrick does not recall the end date of the tapes.  It had been their understanding that the tapes of the transcribed diaries were destroyed; they first learned that such tapes existed on the evening of November 21.  They received the tapes the next day, November 22, 1993, and terminated their representation of Senator Packwood.<p> <p> <H4> 4.   Specific Entries From the Diary</H4><p> <p>     For the most part, with some exceptions, the focus has been on those entries in the diaries where material that was on the audiotape did not appear on the Cormack transcript, and different entries were substituted in their place.  This is the case for several reasons.  First, there were a great number of entries on the audiotape that did not appear in the Cormack transcript that dealt with subjects which were not related to the Committee's inquiry, or did not involve conduct that would be subject to the Committee's jurisdiction.[fn 151]<p> <p>     Additionally, it was just as likely that these entries had been left out by Cathy Cormack as she hurried to finish transcribing the diaries.  Indeed, she testified that she did leave out a large number of entries that she considered unimportant.<p> <p>     Most importantly, with respect to those entries where material was <STRONG>added</STRONG> to the Cormack transcript in the place of material that had been on the audiotape, those changes had been made not by the transcriber, Ms. Cormack, but by Senator Packwood.  There is a limited number of such entries, and many of them deal with information on the audiotape that relates to the Committee's inquiry, or that could possibly implicate Senator Packwood in misconduct within the Committee's jurisdiction.<p> <p>     Diary entries in the following categories are set out below, with the original audiotape version on the left, and the corresponding version from the transcript typed by Ms. Cormack from tapes altered by Senator Packwood on the right.  The portions that are on the audiotape but were left out of the Cormack transcript are underlined and in italics, while the portions that are not on the audiotape, but were added to the transcript, are underlined and in bold letters. <p> <p> --- Entries dealing with the Committee's inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct and intimidation;<p> <p> --- Entries dealing with campaign activity and use of Senator Packwood's Senate office for campaign purposes. <p>     Following these entries is also a summary of other entries that were changed by Senator Packwood, referring to his negotiations with the Oregon Citizens Alliance during his 1992 campaign; contacts with Committee members by Senator Packwood in regard to the inquiry; and entries relating to Senator Packwood's acceptance or solicitation of contributions by lobbyists to his legal defense fund.<p> <p> <p>      a.   Entries Dealing with the Committee's Inquiry into Allegations of Sexual Misconduct and Intimidation<blockquote><p> <hr><P> <B>AUDIOTAPE</B><p> <p> <B>February 5, 1993</B><p> <p> Elaine called, had a sad message.  Channel 2 has said that five more women are willing to come forward to say they've been sexually abused by me or sexually harassed or something, including one in the early '90s.  I said to Elaine, can't be employees if they are - these are five Oregon women.   She said one of them could be [Complainant 1]. <I>I said well, I hope so, but we're going to take her hard. </I>She said you and I know it cannot be employees in the Oregon office in the '80s. <I>It could be [former staff member] from the '70s. I didn't say this to her, but it could.</I><p> <hr> <B>CORMACK TRANSCRIPT</B><p> <p> Elaine called with a sad message.  Channel 2 has said that five more women are willing to come forward to say they have been sexually abused by me or harassed or something, including one in the early '80s.   These are five women.  I said, "It can't be employees."  She said, "One could be [Complainant 1]."  I said, <I>"Well  yes  but she's a habitual liar.  We know that. We can prove that.  That will surely blow down her testimony."</I>  I said, "You and I know it cannot be employees in the office in the '80s.<p> <hr> <p></blockquote>     At his deposition, Senator Packwood testified that Complainant 1 was a chronic troublemaker, who lied and fantasized, and could not be trusted, although he could not identify anyone on his staff who had made complaints about her, nor could he produce any records reflecting such complaints.  Nor do his diaries reflect any such problems with Complainant 1, even though the Senator routinely and often harshly critiqued the performance of members of his staff.<p> <p>     The former staff member referred to in the audiotape, whose name does not appear in the Cormack transcript, appears to be someone the Senator thought could be a potential complainant. However, the Senator testified that it never would have occurred to him that this person could be a complainant.<p> <p>     The information substituted in the Cormack transcript serves to document the Senator's claims that Complainant 1 was a "habitual liar."  It also leaves out any mention of a former staff member who it appears that Senator Packwood thought might be a potential complainant.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood guessed that he had deleted the information about the former staff member, because her name had never appeared in the press and he did not want to give the press another lead to chase down.  He testified that this change had nothing to do with the Committee.  While he was changing that, he thought that he would put in the truth about Complainant 1.<p> <p>     At his appearance before the Committee in June 1995, Senator Packwood was questioned about this alteration by Senator Bryan as follows:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR BRYAN<p> <p> Q:   But, Senator, my point is you knew that in February of 1993.  I mean, by your own statement you knew by February 5th of 1993, that at least in your opinion she was, you know, not to be trusted and was a liar, but you didn't say that in the dictated portion of the audiotape.  Sometime between February 5th 1993, and the later part of 1993--and you may be able to tell us when--you went back and changed that.<p> <p> A:   I am confused now.<p> <p> Q:   Well, February 5th 1993, you dictated the statement about her.  Then, the Cormack transcript--<p> <p> *   *   *<p> <p> A:   Okay.  Cathy's is the one that said, "Well, yes, but she's an habitual liar.  We know that."  Is that--<p> <p> Q:   Yes.  And that is the alteration.  My point being, that doesn't seem to have anything to do with embarrassment or protecting somebody from any sense of awkwardness.  And the fact that it was made, Senator, just a few months after the original entry was dictated, at least raises a question as to what the motive was.  You knew in February of 1993 that this was not a good and trusted employee.  You have indicated that you found that out.  And one would think that you would characterize that in your February 5th 1993 original audiotape. When you go back to make the change, you put this negative characterization in--which may be accurate; we don't know--but I mean that is a change that doesn't seem to fit in with the general rubric of embarrassment, or trying to avoid hurt or harm to someone.<p> <p> A:   Well, first, as I indicated, when I took that one, one of my reasons was [Complainant 1] name being mentioned there who had never been in the press, and who for other reasons she would not want her name out.  And at the time, I am simply dictating that, and--you give a preciseness to this that is not precise. I think you almost think that-- again, I am not looking at something.  I am listening to something--that with strict attention you hear every bit and you think to yourself every change you're going to make. Whether I not[sic] put in in[sic] the original transcript she's a liar, I didn't.  I knew she was at the time.  I'm not sure the fact that I failed to put it in is indicative of anything.</blockquote><p> <blockquote> <p><hr><P> <B>AUDIOTAPE</B><p> <p> <B>February 12, 1993</B><p> <p> This was the bad day.   First, we discovered that Gina is going to have a press conference in Eugene.  This is Gina Hutton, my 1980 campaign chair, who appeared in a story this week that I tried to kiss her.  Then Lindy Paull called and said she wants to put out a statement to the Oregonian - that a statement she submitted said nothing about women's past sexual history, and she was quite adamant she doesn't want to be associated with that kind of attack, as she regards.  She was pissed.  She was so pissed, I think she may resign, and of course, she's a hot property and she'll do well. <I>Then I called Tim Lee, just to remind him not to talk to the Dress. and he said well,  had called again. and [name omitted] always shuts off the calls and [name omitted] says he doesn't want to talk to any paper that's got a vendetta against Senator Packwood. and says it's not a vendetta against Senator Packwood. It's against Elaine.</I><p> <p> * * * * *<p> <p> <I>Now we've got further problems. Lindy Paull -- with the story the Oregonian is going to do listing the people who gave names of The Washington Post. Lindy Paull's name, of course, is going to be mentioned.  She gave a perfectly harmless statement that her statement about the lack of Complainant 1's professionalism, but she wants to call the Oregonian and make it very specific, have them make it very specific that her statement did not relate in any way to sexual misconduct or past history. Then Josie wants to call the Oregonian to find out what their story is going to be about.  Elaine and Julie called her back from the road and she was very curt, very short when Elaine says to what end do you want to find out?  She said I don't have to tell you. Elaine called [name omitted] and says let's face it, some of those that play in the big leagues - don't play in the big leagues are going to bail out.  You might as well assume that the nonpoliticals will bail out.  And I says yeah, but - I said later to Elaine. Josie is a political. [name omitted] says you don't know who may bail out.</I><p><hr> <p> <B>CORMACK TRANSCRIPT</B><p> <p> This was the bad day.  First, we discovered that Gina is going to have a press conference in Eugene.  This is Gina Hutton, my 1980 campaign chair, who appeared in a story this week and said I tried to kiss her.  Then Lindy Paull called and said she wants to put out a statement to the Oregonian that the statement she submitted said nothing about anyone's past sexual history and she was quite adamant.  She doesn't want to be associated with that kind of attack, as she regards it. She was pissed, so pissed she may resign.  She's a hot property.  She'll do well. <STRONG>Lindy really is deceptive. She is sweet on appearance. She is tough of mind but God, is she brilliant with tax law. She can stand toe to toe with anybody on the Joint Committee. she can buffalo any of the minority staff, she is popular with the women, she is popular with the tax lawyers. She'll have no difficulty getting a very good job</STRONG>. *   * *   *  <p> <p><hr> <p></blockquote>     The Committee's original inquiry included allegations that Senator Packwood had attempted to intimidate potential witnesses, and that he had used staff members in an attempt to do so.  These allegations were ultimately found by the Ethics Committee not to be supported by substantial credible evidence, but at the time the diary changes were made it was a matter under inquiry by the Ethics Committee.  Ms. Paull, who worked for Senator Packwood on the Finance Committee, provided Senator Packwood with a statement about Complainant 1, which he forwarded to the <I>Washington Post.</I>This entry indicates that Ms. Paull, along with other staffers, may have had concerns about the use of their statements by the Post.  It also indicates that Senator Packwood did not want Tim Lee, who had provided a statement about another complainant, to talk to the press about it.<p> <p>     The material that was added to the Cormack transcript is entirely different, deleting any indication that Lindy Paull was uncomfortable with her statement, and painting a flattering picture of Ms. Paull, who gave the statement about the Complainant 1, whose allegation involved a 1990 incident that occurred after the staff party at the Irish Times.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he did not recall making the changes to the first entry on this date, but looking at it, he was sure that he must have done it.  He stated that he wanted to take out the reference to him telling Tim Lee not to talk to the press.  He added the flattering material about Lindy Paull out of compulsion, because he had a space left on the tape.  He stated that sometimes he filled in these spaces, and sometimes he did not.  He could not say whether he or Ms. Cormack was responsible for leaving out the second entry on this date.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE</B><p> <p> <B>March 20, 1993</B><p> <p> My normal morning errands, then into the office about 9:00 for a few hours, worked, <I>played a couple hands of cards.

He stated that there were a number of times where he caught her name throughout the diaries, and he took it out.  He was trying to protect her from hounding by the press.  He did not think that Ms. Cormack would have left out this entry.[fn 152]<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE</B><p> <p> <B>March 29, 1993</B><p> <p> Got home about 6:30.  Cooked some soup.

It indicates that Senator Packwood was concerned that he had incriminating documents that could be subject to the Committee's request, and his fear that his diaries might be included in the request.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he thought that he deleted the information from the audiotape, and substituted the information that appears on the Cormack transcript.  He took the information out of the audiotape because he did not want the press to see an entry indicating that he told his attorney that some of his memos would be very incriminating.  He added the information that appears in the Cormack transcript just to fill a gap .<p> <p>     In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood stated that at the time he changed this passage, in the summer of 1993, the Committee already had his memos, implying that there would be no reason for him to want to hide this entry from the Committee.  However, Senator Packwood withheld 112 documents, many of them memoranda, from the Committee on the grounds of attorney-client privilege.  The privilege log indicates that six of the memoranda were dated before the time when Senator Packwood's attorneys were retained.  Thus, it is impossible to determine whether in fact the Committee received the memos referred to in this entry.  Moreover, regardless of whether the Ethics Committee had the memos when Senator Packwood changed the tape, this entry evidences Senator Packwood's state of mind when he received the Committee's document request on March 29, 1993. Senator Packwood's state of mind was discussed at length at his June 1995 appearance before the Committee:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR DORGAN<p> <p> Q:   This is in March in 1993, and you were provided with a motion by the Committee to produce documents, and so on. At that point you say:  I wonder if that includes diaries? Everything?  I was scared to death.  And then you said: 'But, I said, my God, some of the early memos before you were retained will be very--some of them are very incriminating,' and so on.  Then you look at the transcript from Cormack, and when you look at this sort of thing you wonder to yourself, gee, isn't this a circumstance where somebody just, first of all, was alerted that they have information that probably is the subject of the motion and probably should be produced at some point, or there may be a question whether it should be produced, and then you go in and you make some alterations that would lead those who eventually got the transcript to a conclusion substantially different.  So I'm just wondering.  You know, when you look at this, if you put one face on it it looks like just flat-out alteration of diaries in order to prevent the Committee from seeing what it wanted to see. And you've described it in another way, but with respect to this particular instance it looks like in March of 1993 you at least were alerted, yourself, to the possibility that these diaries might have to go to the Committee.<p> <p> A:   Yes.  Although, if I read this correctly, the reference to "diaries" is not taken out in either one, is it?<p> <p> Q:   No, no.  My point isn't that you took out the reference to diaries.<p> <p> A:   Oh, I see.<p> <p> Q:   I make two points with this.  One is, in March of 1993 you at that point were alarmed in your own mind that you might have to produce diaries, but you wondered whether you had to produce diaries to the Committee that early on. The point is, later you were altering a lot of transcripts, including this one, apparently, on the tape, and you did alter this one in a manner that took out the reference to some incriminating--some memos that could be incriminating and so on.  So that material that you altered here would obviously be altered if one would look at it that way, and it would obviously be altered to take information out which would be harmful to yourself.<p> <p> A:   Well,...I should say I knew exactly what I was talking about here--but in talking to Resnick, they have--in fact, they gave you the memos, as a matter of fact.  These are some of the ones I argued with them about that I didn't want to go to you, and they gave them to you.  But... If I was changing this to fool the Committee, you already had the documents that I didn't want to go to you. But would you want out in the press a statement, God there's incriminating documents--I mean, I don't use the word incriminating" in the sense of criminal, but I can picture a press saying criminal or Packwood has criminal documents.  So indeed I changed this, obviously, sometime-- this is March of '93--sometime in July of '93, but it's the kind of thing I wouldn't want out.<p> <p> But if the argument is that I was changing these in October, apparently, or after the subpoena, to fool the Committee you already had the documents.  If I was changing it to fool the Committee, you asked me yesterday about [person], if I was changing it in October, you'd already deposed me about her.  I wouldn't have been taking it out to keep it from you, you had it...you cannot sense...fear of the press and what they were doing to me...But do you understand what I mean?  That if I took this out when I think someone would say I was taking it out, it was an irrelevancy....<p> <p> BY SENATOR MCCONNELL<p> <p> Q:   But wasn't the other question, wholly aside from the issue of alteration, was not the other question whether the dictation indicated that at the time it crossed your mind that the diaries might be something the Committee--<p> <p>  A:   Well, and it may have been at this stage that they said, no.  I'm not quite sure....<p> <p> *   *   *   *<p> <p> BY SENATOR BRYAN<p> <p> Q:   ...as I understand what [Senator Dorgan's] point is is[sic] that you were somewhat concerned or alarmed in March that you might have to turn over the diaries, and so the question at least in our mind is:  If that is so, why would you not then have informed your attorney that indeed there was an original audiotape?  At least it gives rise to express some concern as to any changes made thereafter, that you had at least in your thought, I might have to produce these diaries....<p> <p> A:   Counsel just called to my attention that March 29th was the date of the document request.  Maybe this was when the lawyer said, well, we don't have to turn the diaries over.  I don't know.  I can't remember....<p> <p> Q:   I think the point that Senator Dorgan,...is it's not a question of what you may have legally been required to turn over, it was what was your state of mind.  And if this entry is accurate, it would suggest that your state of mind was one of considerable concern that the diary materials contained incriminating information.  And then, apparently...the changed part changes the thrust of the meaning entirely....<p> <p> A:   Well, again, and I'm saying if you're suggesting that I changed this--well, as a matter of fact, when I changed this the Committee had the documents.  If this is 1993, this change was made in late July or the first of August and you already had the documents.  I don't take out any reference to the diaries.  I take out references to the incriminating documents, and you had them.</blockquote> <blockquote><P><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE</B><p> <p> <B>May 28, 1993</B><p> <p> And I said of course I'd help him [former staffer]. <I>Then he asked if he could talk to me personally for a moment.

But if this entry were to come out, that the former staffer had offered to say something about the former staffer/complainant, the press would be all over the former staffer.  He agreed that he had already given the <I>Washington Post</I> a statement by the former staffer about the former staffer/complainant, but he did not believe that his name had appeared in public at the time of this diary entry.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he would have made these changes in late July or early August 1993, very close to the recess time.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> June 29. 1993</B><p> <p> Fundraiser was fine.  On the way home, <I>I discovered something that was disturbing, however.  S-1 had told S-2 about our evening in the office, only she told S-2, the way she told it to me. and she's straight out lying.  She says we were drinking.  She admitted she was drunk, and that I came out of the bathroom nude.  And then I didn't ask S-2, did she say we had a sexual relationship where I forced myself on her or what? I should have thought to pursue it.  I did not tell S-2 the specifics of what I remember from my diary because I didn't want S-2 to know it was in the diary, but goddamn. S-1 used the same expression, a statistic - she felt like a stat - a statistic.  And then S-2 said that S-3 used the word statistic. I'll bet anything S-1 has told this to S-3.<p> <p>       Now, interestingly, she told S-2 just a few days before she left here. this is about the same time she told me, in exactly the same story as if she's trying to build a case. and she tells everybody three years - well. it 1s three years after the event. Came here in '89 - I think she came in '89. and she's not telling them about the time she came into my office and another time when she practically put it to me. She's not telling them about the time she took me home from the Crawfords after swimming, lay on my bed. took off her blouse. took off her bra and asked me to rub some aloe on her very badly burned skin from the sunburn at the Crawfords. I won't describe in full detail her what happened while we were doing that, but it was a lot more than rubbing aloe on her bare back.</I><p> <p> *  *  *  *<p> <p> <I>I had also forgot to say I called Lee McAfee after S-2 dropped me off and told her what S-2 had told me, and Lee said this is very important because S-1 had never told Lee about the consensual situation. She had alleged some other groping or grasping when I was drunk and admits that I was drunk, is what she said to me. She wasn't really mad about it even. But she's never said anything about our consensual relations.  Lee says it's quite helpful.  S-2 also said that S-1 confronted her and then said well, there must be - I think this is what she said - now, I may get it confused - I think S-1 said to S-2 well, of course, you've had a relationship with the senator.  S-2 said she has looked at her And said no. Now, I may have had that confused with what S-2 said to S-3 and S-3 said to S-2 that S-1 on one occasion said to S-3, you know, the senator and S-2 must be having a relationship, and S-3 said no, I don't think so. Well, I don't know what to make of all this.</I><p><hr> <p> <B>CORMACK TRANSCRIPT</B><p> <p>    The fundraiser was fine and on the way home <STRONG>we again kidded about S-2's relationship with that fellow she'd been sleeping with or nooning with.

And she acted put out much like the way [name omitted] would act with a slight difference in emphasis.<p> <p>    And I thought to myself - would I have to courage to do that. I'm trying to think of what would be the federal equivalent in Oregon and there is none because we don't have a big federal presence.

I don't know.</STRONG><p><hr> <p> </blockquote>     The deleted passages discuss Senator Packwood's concerns that the staffer, S-1, who is also referred to in the March 20, 1993 entry above, might "build a case."  These entries, as well as an entry for November 29, 1989, indicate that Senator Packwood had a consensual sexual relationship with this staff member while she worked for him.[fn 154]  It also suggests that there could have been non-consensual aspects to Senator Packwood's relationship with that staffer, which created his concern that this staffer might talk to the Committee. [fn 155]<p> <p>      Senator Packwood testified that he thought he was responsible for the deletions in the first entry for this date, and the corresponding substitutions to the Cormack transcript. He was asked by Counsel why he made the changes, and he testified that he took this passage out of the audiotape because he did not want the press to have it.  However, despite his testimony that he was worried that the press would obtain his diaries, and he was reviewing them during the first half of 1993 and over the August 1993 recess, Senator Packwood did not delete the November 29, 1989 entry, which recounts the "famous night" and is at least as explosive as the deleted June 29, 1993 entry.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked why he had substituted embarrassing details in the Cormack transcript about another staffer's (S-2's) personal life.  He stated that it was "kind of facetious," and not entirely true.  He stated that he should not have put this entry in, because there was no point in his talking to the press - which is what he would be doing if his diaries came out - about that kind of a conversation.<blockquote> <p> Q:   How do you think the press might have reacted to that kind of information about [S-2]?<p> <p> A:   I think, as you'd read it, there's almost a lilt, a kidding to it, and it is kidding.  And I meant it as that way when I put it in.  This three times a week for seven years, I mean, you ever talk about things not being true? She never told me that she had been going with some guy making love to him three times - what did I say - three times a week for seven years.<p> <p> Q:   It would appear that the kind of information you have added here about [S-2] is of a similar kind to the information about others which you might have deleted.<p> <p> A:   It was just dumb on my part.  I shouldn't have put it in.  I meant it in a kidding fashion.  I did not mean it here in a - I think you can tell from the way it's phrased. I didn't mean it in a serious sense, but I still shouldn't have put it in.</blockquote> <p>     Although Senator Packwood testified at his deposition and later in his appearance before the Ethics Committee that S-2 never told him "that she had been going with some guy making love to him three times . . . a week for seven years," there is in fact a lengthy entry in Senator Packwood's diary for June 11, 1992, in which he recounts an evening when he and S-2 went out for dinner, and after S-2 had quite a bit to drink, she told him about a man she had been seeing for seven years, and making love with two or three times a week, unbeknownst to Senator Packwood and the others in his office.  Senator Packwood then kidded S-2 that he and S-2 had made love six or seven times, because he felt sorry for her, and out of a sense of  Christian duty, and it turned out that she had been "banging" another man three times a week for seven years.<p> <p>     With respect to the second set of entries for this date, Senator Packwood stated that in general, although 99 percent of the "bulk" changes were done by Ms. Cormack, in this particular case, he thought that he was responsible for the deletion of the entry that appears on the audiotape, because it involved S-1, who had been one of his favorite employees.  He thought that he probably substituted the material that appears on the Cormack transcript, out of a compulsion to fill in a big blank spot on the tape.<blockquote> <p><hr><P> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> July 26, 1993</B><p> <p> Talked with [name omitted].

In this particular case, she sure could, on politics in the office, but she was up to her neck in that also.  But in this, there's nothing she can say, and if she were to try to rat on me, it would probably end our relationship.

It also indicates that she knew a lot about "politics in the office," that she herself was "up to her neck," or heavily involved in using Senator Packwood's office for political purposes, and that Senator Packwood had some concern that she would try to "rat" on him.  Instead, a passage has been substituted indicating that she knew nothing that could implicate Senator Packwood in either the issue of sexual misconduct, or the issue of witness intimidation.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the information that was added to the Cormack transcript would have been done by him, and not by Ms. Cormack.  He stated that the person referred to in fact knew next to nothing, but he did not want the press to see the part indicating that if she were to "rat," it would be the end of their relationship, and to speculate about what it was that she knew.  He testified that he substituted in its place a statement that was accurate.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked what he meant when he said in the audiotape that the person referred to was up to her neck in politics in the office.  He stated that he assumed that it referred to research that his office did for his 1992 campaign, and that he might have had one or two people who were doing a fair amount of research.  He did not recall who those people were.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood guessed that he changed this entry for July 26, 1993 in early August of 1993, before he left for recess.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> August 5, 1993</B><p> <p> <I>. . . if they're not going to take hearsay, then they've got to take only complaining witnesses.

At this point, the Committee had not notified Senator Packwood that Ms. Foster-Filppi was a complainant, nor had her name appeared in the press.  This entry indicates that Senator Packwood may have been concerned that the Committee would uncover allegations by Ms. Foster-Filppi and the "ex-intern," and that if the Committee did not find them the only conduct he would have to worry about would be conduct occurring more than ten years ago. The substituted passage in the Cormack transcript discusses an entirely different subject - it sets out his reassurance of support to the woman referred to in the entry.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he assumed that he substituted the information that appears on the Cormack transcript, but not on the audiotape. He stated that he took out the entry about Ms. Foster-Filppi because the press did not have her name, and obviously, he just filled in the blank space on the tape.<blockquote><p><hr> <p>  <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> August 7, 1993</B><p> <p> Met Cath at Sutton Place to take a look at a unit that had become available.

[name omitted] arrived on time.<p><hr> <p> </blockquote>     The first deleted passage indicates that in early August 1993, shortly after receiving the Committee's second request for documents (July 16, 1993), Senator Packwood was reviewing his diary, and he concluded it would be helpful in his defense.  In its place, a self-serving passage has been added reflecting that Senator Packwood wants to work hard for what is good for America.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that it appeared that he had deleted the highlighted information in the first passage from the audiotape, and substituted the information that appears on the Cormack transcript.  He stated that Ms. Cormack had told him that she could bring the diaries up to date, but she did not have any of it done when he got back from recess around Labor Day 1993. He took these entries out so that she would not see them and think that he was mad at her.<p> <p>       Senator Packwood recalled asking Ms. Cormack on this date if she could hurry up with the transcribing.  It was probably at this time that he gave her six to eight additional tapes, covering 1993 up to date, and including a tape that ended immediately before the recess.  He could not remember if he gave her these tapes on Saturday August 7, or on Sunday; he had worked all night on them.  According to the dates on the tapes themselves, the Senator would have given her a tape covering up through August 5, 1993 before leaving on August recess.<p> <p>     The second deleted passage suggests that there are diary entries relevant to the allegations of witness intimidation, which was a subject of the Committee's inquiry, and also suggests that there may have been some concern that Ann Elias, who provided a statement about Julie Williamson which Senator Packwood forwarded to the <I>Washington Post,</I> and who had by this time testified before the Committee, had lied.  Ms. Elias stated in her deposition that Ms. Williamson came to her house after Senator Packwood kissed her in his office, and that she concluded that Ms. Williamson was interested in having an affair with the Senator.  She also told the Committee that Ms. Williamson did not tell her the details about the Senator pulling her hair and grabbing her girdle. Her statement that went to the Washington Post claimed that Ms. Williamson was interested in having an affair with Senator Packwood, but did not include the fact that Ms. Williamson had told her about the incident almost immediately after it happened.<p> <p>     There are in fact other diary entries that suggest that Ms. Elias had misgivings about her statement - that she felt torn between her loyalty to the Senator and her desire to tell the truth - and that she was "buoyed up" by Jack Faust, a friend of the Senator's, who convinced her that Ms. Williamson had been telling her story on the "cocktail circuit" for years, and that it had changed over the years with the retelling.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that this was the kind of deletion and addition he would have made as he was changing his diary tapes, although he did not find much difference between the two entries.  He was not sure that he deleted the reference to Ms. Elias, and he stated that Ms. Cormack may have taken out her name, as they were old friends, but he thought that he had made the other changes.  He added the information that appears in the Cormack transcript because it was accurate information, and he thought that he would put it in.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked if he had some concern in August of 1993 about whether Ann Elias had lied.  He stated that somebody in the press had claimed that Ms. Elias had lied, but in fact, she had not.  He did not know what he meant by this entry, but he knew that when he made the original entry on the audiotape, he did not in fact think that some of his diary entries might raise an issue as to whether Ms. Elias had lied.<p> <p>     This entry is for Saturday, August 7, 1993, the same day that recess began. Senator Packwood stated that it appeared from his diary that he went to Oregon on the following Monday.  He did not know when he dictated this entry, but stated that it would have been after 1:30 p.m. on the Saturday before he left, which is the time of this entry.  Senator Packwood was unsure about when he changed this entry, but he testified that he did not make changes to the tape that was in his machine when he left for recess until he returned in September. Given the fact that the tape that covers this entry begins on August 6, 1993, it appears that this entry was changed in September.<p> <p>      At his June 1995 appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood was again asked about this entry:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR SMITH:<p> <p> Q:   ...Now instead of simply deleting that ("did Ann Elias lie and did I attempt to unjustifiably gather information...") but again, that would be, it appears to me, would be something, if it is intimidation, it would be something that the Committee would have an interest in.  But you didn't simply delete it. You changed it.  You added considerably to it by making the point that we never intended to intimidate anyone.  You went far beyond the entry with the second entry.  My point is, let me just make the point and then ask you to respond: The passage that you deleted suggests that there might be diary entries related to the gathering of information about the women...And it suggests further that there may have been concern that Elias had perhaps not been truthful....And then in the entry that you put in the Cormack transcript where the entry goes beyond that to an absolute "We never intended to intimidate anyone."  Whereas in one there is an implication and in the second one you go beyond that.  You kill that completely by saying you never intended to intimidate anyone.<p> <p> A:   Well, you bet.  We didn't intend to intimidate anybody. ...We were given 24 hours by the Washington Post to gather information...It was not to be part of the story but to judge the evaluation of the people that had complained... So, no, we didn't intend to intimidate, and that's why I put it in this way. If the press ever got this, I want them to see that....<p> <p> Q:   ...My question is, though:  Why use the diary--which the diary should be basically an anecdotal record of what transpired under a given period of time--why use a diary entry to make that point?  I mean, you could have deleted it.  If you had deleted the passage, there wouldn't have been any reference to it, and you could have made a statement to the press, couldn't you, that said I never intended to intimidate anyone?  But you put it in the diary in retrospect rather than--<p> <p>  A:    Well we had said to the press on a number of occasions that we did not intend to intimidate.  This wasn't a new statement.  But you try to give this a preciseness that simply, in retrospect, cannot be given to it . . . .</blockquote> <blockquote><p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> October 9, 1993</B><p> <p> <I>Stopped at Cathy's and gave her the tapes to transcribe.

This passage tends to indicate that Senator Packwood retrieved his diary tapes from Ms. Cormack shortly after his deposition was interrupted and the Committee specifically asked to review his diaries, and that he returned them a few days later, on October 9.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he would not have seen this entry until later in October 1993, when it came out of Ms. Cormack's typewriter.  He thinks that he would have taken the typed page back to Ms. Cormack and had her substitute the new language, or he could have dictated instructions to her on a tape, with yellow underlining on the typed page.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he would have wanted to take out the information that appeared in the audiotape because it was wrong.  He did not take her seven tapes on this date; he only had a couple of tapes left, and one of them may have been a half- tape.  He asked Ms. Cormack to do seven tapes by Tuesday night, but he did not want the diary to give the impression that he had taken seven tapes to her on this date.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood also guessed that the diary issue had exploded in the press by this time.  Senator Packwood did not want the press to know that there were diary tapes because nobody, not even Ms. Cormack or his attorneys, knew that there were tapes.  Senator Packwood later said that neither his attorneys nor Ms. Cormack knew he kept <B>backup</B> tapes, although obviously they knew that his diary was transcribed from tapes. He simply did not want the press to know about tapes, period.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that this entry would have been transcribed by Ms. Cormack later in October, and he felt that he had the right to take something out that was wrong, when it was the first time he had seen the typed transcript.  He did not believe that he was "forever stopped" from changing anything he ever dictated again after the deposition, and if he was seeing it for the first time, he was free to change it.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood could recall no particular reason that he added the information that appears in the Cormack transcript, but he stated that it was accurate.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> October 10, 1993</B><p> <p> <I>Talked to Cath about 8:30.

It also indicates that as of this date, Ms. Cormack had only typed part of the 1992 tapes.  This is consistent with the October 20, 1993 letter from Senator Packwood's attorneys to the Committee, stating that Ms. Cormack had only finished typing about half of the 1992 tapes by that point.  The substituted passage is completely innocuous, and contains no reference to the diaries.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he did not specifically recall deleting this entry, but he could have, because it gives the impression he gave Ms. Cormack seven tapes the day before, which is incorrect.  He stated that he took her one or two tapes, the one that was in his machine when he gave her tapes in August, and maybe one-half of another tape.<p> <p>      b.   Entries Dealing with Campaign Activity and Campaign Purposes.<blockquote><p> <p><hr> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> December 31, 1992</B><p> <p>    The most important thing that happened was a phone call from FS-1.  W-1, that Oregonian reporter, was calling her, following up on some alleged violations of ethics in letters that we sent out in 1984 and 1985.  He had heard from sources that FS-1 had quit because she refused to type a letter in the office on Senate equipment that was a fund-raising letter, so she quit over it.  She blames Elaine totally for it.  She doesn't blame me at all.  She said we had done a mailing earlier in my travels to New England, but she said those mailings of course were all right.  They were in response to invitations that I had to speak, and we were simply putting other functions together around them. Well, it's a good thing FS-1 doesn't know everything.<p> <p>    W-1 wanted to know how many pieces were done, how many man-hours did it take.  It was not franked mail, not Senate stationery.  He asked her, "Did you get a ruling from the Ethics Committee?"  She said, "No, Ethics might have said it was okay."  He then said, "Well, FS-2 apparently quit over the same thing, and, he says, "you and FS-2 quit at about the same time."  FS-1 says, "No, we quit seven or eight months apart."  He asked if FS-1 then went over to the campaign.  She left in the summer of '84.  She said no, she didn't go back to work until she went to work for in '85.  <p> <p>      Then FS-2 called FS-1.  FS-1 assumed that FS-2 had told him all this, and FS-2 says no, he hadn't told him, that he had all the details when he called FS-2 three weeks ago.  W-1 says the source was not a member of staff, and he has called [name omitted], [name omitted], and he may try [name omitted].  FS-1 said that no one would have known except Elaine and FS-1, because they worked on this in private in my office.  She said, however, [name omitted] would know, because [name omitted] and FS-1 talked when I was visiting  in 1985, and FS-1 and sat in the outer office and she told her the story.  This is eight years ago, so why did she quit? [name omitted] knows, but FS-1-didn't tell her, so she presumes [name omitted] did.<p> <p>      W-1 asked if FS-1 knew [name omitted] FS-1 said only in the sense that she had heard of her, in the way she has heard of Jack Faust or Dave Barrows or [name omitted], as she calls [name omitted].  FS-1 said she was quite critical of the Oregonian for even thinking of doing a story like this.  She said FS-2 was not going to allow his name to be used or [name omitted] name to be used. FS-1 asked for the same privilege but W-1 refused. FS-1 said, "Elaine does things the Senator doesn't know about, and the Senator should not be blamed for things he didn't know about."  FS-1 again said that New England was okay.  It was not a fund- raiser.<p> <p>    <I>He asked her who the mailings were being done for. FS-1 said she couldn't remember, although he has called her two or three times and she does remember it now it was [name omitted], but she hasn't told him that.  Used his letterhead.  There was no enclosure that went with it. W-1 asked about [name omitted] and some letter that included a coin.  Well, of course that was the shekel letter, and that was sent out by our direct mail house.<p> <p>     FS-2 left six months or so after FS-1 left, allegedly for the same reason, a different letter.  He said it was an Israeli or a Jewish letter.</I> FS-1 said, I don't have a lot of respect, in fact, I don't have any respect for Elaine, but if you're going after Elaine, you should separate her from Bob Packwood," she said.<p><hr> <p> <B>CORMACK TRANSCRIPT</B><p> <p>  But the most important thing that happened during the day was that FS-1 called.  She said a reporter named W-1 of the Oregonian had called her and he was on the trail of a story about alleged violations of law or ethics or something - some letters that had been sent out on official Senate stationery or on Senate time or something like that - and FS-1 quit.  And FS-1 said she blames Elaine.  <STRONG>FS-1 said, "You know I don't like Elaine very well."</STRONG> She said the New England letters we sent out were okay because we had been invited to speak.  W-1 then wanted to know how many letters or how many man hours. She said, she wasn't sure.  W- 1 asked if we'd gotten a ruling from the Ethics Committee.  FS-1 said she didn't know.  W-1 then asked if FS-2 didn't quit about the same time.  FS-1 said no. He'd been there seven or eight months and quit after FS-1 did.  FS-2 then called FS-1 and FS-1 assumed FS-2 had told W-1 all of the information  he had.  W-1 said no, that his source is not a member of the staff.  That he has called [name omitted], he has called [name omitted] and he may try [name omitted].  FS-1 said Elaine might honestly think (inaudible) fired FS-1 for another reason because Elaine and FS-1 weren't getting along at all at this time.  But FS-1 said, "[name omitted] knew because when I was visiting [name omitted] in 1985 she had told about it and FS-1 knows that knows but FS-1 didn't tell [name omitted] so FS-1 presumes did.  W-1 asked if she knew [name omitted] and she doesn't.  FS-1 told W-1 she was mad at the Oregonian for doing the story and she did not want her name used under any circumstances.  FS-1 then told me she had utterly no respect for Elaine and <STRONG>she said, "Senator. I don't want to do anything to harm you but I don't like Elaine."</STRONG><p><hr> <p> </blockquote>     These entries discuss charges that appeared in the press in late 1992, to the effect that two staffers had quit Senator Packwood's office after being forced to do campaign work on Senate time.  On March 25, 1993, the Committee asked Senator Packwood to respond to these published allegations.  The sentences added to the Cormack transcript, to the effect that one of the staffers making these charges did not like Elaine Franklin, Senator Packwood's chief of staff, could be viewed as an attempt to ascribe a motive to the complaint being made by this staffer - the desire to "get  the chief of staff.<p> <p>     The deleted passages also indicate that there may in fact have been a campaign related mailing that was done from Senator Packwood's Senate office.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood's response appears after the next diary excerpt.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> January 1, 1993</B><p> <p> FS-1 says, "My quotes are positive to you, and if you let me use them, it would put you in a good light."

Well, W- 1 called her back, said he had talked to his editor and it's okay to use FS-1's name because the name had come from third party sources, but he would be willing to say that she refused any comment.  She wanted to know what to do, and I said, "When he calls back, tell him you don't want your name used under any circumstances." <I>I said, "FS- 1, this is not going to help you.

He wanted to know what hotel we stayed at at Bandon. He said "In reviewing the reimbursements, it seems the Senator spends a lot of time in Coos Bay." At least that's the way FS-1 interpreted it. FS-1 thought he meant a trip. I said, "Did he mean when you were there or does he mean currently?"  FS-1 says, "Well, I'm not sure." Of course, what he could be thinking is, Elaine spends a lot of time in  Coos Bay.

The substituted passages reinforce this theme, by suggesting that the former staffer had done political letters before without complaining.<p> <p>     The deleted passages also indicate that there may be some validity to the former staffer's claims, and that Senator Packwood advised Ms. Franklin either to "stonewall" the claims, or to state that the former staffer was fired for other reasons.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he made the original entries to his diary audiotape at the same time that he was reviewing his diary tapes to find entries for his attorneys regarding the intimidation issue, during the end of December 1992 and early January 1993.  While he was reviewing his tapes for his attorneys, the former staffer called him, and told him that the <I>Oregonian</I> had called her about the story.  He had several conversations with her about it, and also with Ms. Franklin.<p> <p>     The Senator testified that at the time, he was being beaten by the press, and he was very concerned that this would result in another story.  Senator Packwood provided several versions of how and when he changed these entries. He first testified that when he gave Ms. Cormack the tapes to use in transcribing excerpts from the fall of 1992 for his attorneys, he may have also asked her to transcribe these entries, during the Christmas recess.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood then testified that he thought he transcribed these entries himself during the Christmas recess, using his secretary's transcribing machine, because he wanted to see them in print.  He then stated that he could not remember whether he transcribed the entries, or whether he asked Ms. Cormack to do so.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood further testified that he was not sure if he made the changes to these entries on the tape around the time of the Christmas break in 1992.  He could not remember if he gave Ms. Cormack these entries to type, indicating which parts of the tape she was to type, or whether he ran these two days onto a separate tape and gave it to Ms. Cormack to transcribe, or whether he simply redictated the whole thing.  Although he had earlier testified that he made the changes to these entries before he went back to Oregon and had the  terrible experience with the press in January 1993, he later stated that he was not sure of that, and he probably would not have made the changes until he finished the tape that was in his machine.  He then stated that he listened to this tape sometime when he was finished listening to the 1992 tapes, but that he did not wait until he was finished changing the 1992 tapes to change this one.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood then said again that at the same time he gave Ms. Cormack the tapes containing the! fall 1992 excerpts, even before he was done dictating on this particular tape, he either gave her this entry to transcribe, or he looked at and redictated it, although he did not necessarily remember redictating it right then.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he made the bulk of the changes to these entries.  They were unusual, because he wanted to see them in "whole cloth" first as to what the former staffer had said, and what Ms. Franklin had said about the story.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that Ms. Cormack could have left portions of these entries out when she was transcribing, and that he did not want to say that he did it all.[fn 156]<p> <p>       Senator Packwood also testified that these conversations with his former staffer, and the fact that the press was involved, caused him to start changing his 1992 diary tapes.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he did not know why he deleted the information from the audiotape, or why he substituted the entries to the Cormack transcript.  There was no logic to the things that were left in and the things that were taken out.  He stated that his mental state of mind in that period was just not rational, and he could not give a rational answer as to why he put things in and left things out.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked why he added the three entries indicating that the former staffer did not like Ms. Franklin.  He stated that the former staffer in fact hated Ms. Franklin and had told him this in telephone conversations around the time of the changes.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood could not recall advising Ms. Franklin either to stonewall this issue, or to say that the former staffer was fired for other reasons, as indicated in the entry on the audiotape.  He was questioned as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:   Do you have any reason to believe this diary entry didn't reflect what you said to [chief of staff]?<p> <p> A:   I'm not going to get into this discussion about accuracy.  I don't know. You're asking me when you dictate on the fly, when you dictate when you're tired, do you accurately reflect things?  You may or may not.

She is so incensed about the FS-2 and FS-1 charges that she's lost her focus.  Of course these relate to her and she wants to clear her name. She says, "You're going to be all right but I'm not employable."  I said, "You're employable with me."  She goes, "Oh God."  I can see where the Oregonian  is going next.  They're going to try to prove we did all kinds of politics in the office.  I talked with Lynn and she said we were very careful about not sending out any fundraising letters from the office. <STRONG>Anything she did she did on her time.</STRONG>  She said she did some minor thank-yous if somebody actually sent money to the office and she may have thanked people who came to special events <STRONG>but she did them on her time.  She said we were especially careful because we'd been warned by the Ethics Committee and [Former Ethics Committee Staff Director] to avoid office involvement.</STRONG><p><hr> <p> </blockquote>     The deleted passages, entered in his diary at the time that the <I>Oregonian</I> was looking into charges that former staffers left his office after being forced to do campaign work on Senate time, indicate that Senator Packwood in fact did an immense amount  of political work in his Senate office, in the form of memos and research about his opponent's voting record, and issues for debate.  The substituted passages instead disclaim any involvement by anyone in his Senate office in political work, and portray his staff as being very careful to avoid such activity.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he thought he was responsible for the changes from the audiotape to the Cormack transcript; he could not imagine Ms. Cormack adding the material that appears in the Cormack transcript.[fn 157]  He stated that he would have made these changes in January, February, March, or April 1993, before he finished making changes to the 1992 tapes.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he probably would have added the language to the Cormack transcript to emphasize, if it got out in the press, that they were not heavily involved in politics in the office.  And in fact, the former Ethics Committee Staff Director had come to his office to advise him.  He would have deleted the corresponding entry in the ,audiotape because he would not want the press to see it.<p> <p>     He stated that he did not know, as it says in his diary, if they did an "immense" amount of research in the office about his opponent's voting record. They did some research, but  immense may be an overstatement.  The Senator testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:   Why would that be of concern to you?<p> <p> A:   Probably because we were doing politics in the office.<p> <p> Q:   Did you understand that that was permitted or not permitted?<p> <p> A:   I knew that we were not supposed to use the office - we used to think of it fundraising, not so much research, and that we tried to keep pretty clear of the office except for the occasional letters that you see [staffer] did.  But most of it of our mail, most of our fundraising was outside the office, but the memos and research we probably did.<p> <p> Q:   Senator, I think you just indicated that you did do a good bit, maybe immense isn't the right word but you did a good bit of politics in the office.<p> <p> A:   Well, I think "research" is the correct term.<p> <p> Q:   Political research?<p> <p> A:   No.  More voting research.<p> <p> Q:   Why would you need [opponent's] voting record and issues for any purpose other than in connection with your campaign?<p> <p> A:   Well, I said that.<p> <p> Q:   So it was in connection with your campaign that that information that research was being done?<p> <p> A:   We were hoping that he wasn't going to be our opponent but if he was, that was the purpose of.</blockquote> <p>      Senator Packwood could not recall who in his office was doing the voting research, but he stated that his personal secretary would have typed any memos he did for his opponent research books.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> March 6, 1992</B><p> <p> I introduced [Senator X], who was the speaker that night, and he was excellent.

The lesser unit always wants the greater unit to give them money of some kind.  Well, anyway. the discussion ended in a draw.</STRONG> [Senator X] left and Elaine and I headed back to the motel.<p><hr> <p> </blockquote>     The deleted passage indicates that ,another Senator, with Senator Packwood's knowledge, had agreed to direct $100,000 from a Republican Party Committee to be used to benefit Senator Packwood's campaign, and had discussed this with Senator Packwood in a meeting with Elaine Franklin and another person.  This entry raises questions about the possible violation of campaign finance laws.  Substituted in its place is an innocuous passage discussing campaign funding.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he deleted the information from the audiotape, and substituted the information that appears on the Cormack transcript.  He stated that the entry on the audiotape was an instance where he did not want to embarrass a fellow Senator, and in fact the entry was wrong:<p> <p> "This is no crime.  Party building activities are perfectly legal and the Senatorial committee gives money to the party if the party puts up money for the Senate candidate.  It cannot just be a passthrough where they give them 100 and they pass it on."<p> <p>     When he realized that the entry was wrong, Senator Packwood decided that it was not something he would want out in the press. He testified that he substituted the material that appears on the Cormack transcript just to fill up the tape.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the part of the diary entry reading "But he says now of course there can't be any legal connection between this money and Senator Packwood" is an example of a conversation that never occurred, because the other Senator would not have said that.  Those were his [Senator Packwood's] words attributed to the other Senator, and they did not even reflect the essence of something that the other Senator said to him.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the meeting reflected in this entry actually took place.  But beyond that, he stated that the entry was simply wrong.  He testified that the conversation in fact reflected nothing that was illegal, that the entry was in jest, and that nobody in Senator X's position would take that kind of a risk.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> March 20, 1992</B><p> <p> <I>Elaine has been talking to me privately about independent expenditures.

Those who won't won't.  Let's let the chips fall where they may.</STRONG><p><hr> <p> </blockquote>      The deleted entries suggest that Senator Packwood knew about possible "independent expenditures" by the Automobile Dealers and possibly Tim Lee, a former staffer, on his behalf, and that he intended to destroy any evidence of a link to the individual who would make the expenditures for the Auto Dealers. This entry raises possible questions about campaign finance improprieties.<p> <p>     The substituted entry is a self-serving passage portraying Senator Packwood as having no knowledge of any independent expenditures made on his behalf, and being above any involvement with or knowledge of any such expenditures.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he suspected that Ms. Cormack left out the first entry on this date, although he was not sure.[fn 158]  He thought that he would have taken out the paragraph about the coalition.  He was sure that he deleted the paragraph about the OCA, as the OCA had been a major problem for him in his campaign.  He stated that he had been terribly afraid that the OCA was going to put a candidate! on the ballot against him in the 1992 election. The OCA also had a measure on the ballot on anti-gay rights that was the hottest issue he had ever seen on the Oregon ballot, and which was heavily editorialized by the Oregonian.  He was not on their side on this issue, or the abortion issue or the compulsory school prayer issue, and the OCA was going to try to take a shot at him.  His campaign did everything they could do to prevent this.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood's opponent in the 1992 election accused him of making deals with the OCA, and the press questioned him repeatedly about this.  He did not want to have anything in his diaries about the OCA.  Senator Packwood agreed that there was not anything in this particular entry that would offend the OCA, but he stated that he had attempted to take out anything he could find about the OCA.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked why he was concerned about the entries referring to the OCA when at the time that he took them out, in the spring of 1993, the election was over.  He stated that at the time, he was beset by the press, which was looking for everything they could find about him from the time the story came out in the <I>Washington Post</I> about the allegations of sexual misconduct.  He did not want the press re!living the election. The press was excoriating him, and he did, not want to give them this information.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that there was no particular reason that he substituted the information in the Cormack transcript about independent expenditures, other than that they may have been talking about it at the time. The subject was on his mind the same day that he was changing his tapes, and he wanted to fill the space on the tape.[fn 159]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the industry group in general did not do any independent expenditures against his opponent.  This particular group did not do anything for or against Senator Packwood, or for or against his opponent.  He did not recall this conversation with Elaine Franklin about independent expenditures, or any conversation about the individual who was to make the expenditures and the industry group, or about Tim Lee and independent expenditures.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked what he meant by the reference to destroying evidence connecting them to the individual who was to make the expenditures, or to independent expenditures.  He stated that if one were going to have coordinated independent expenditures, which is wrong, one would not want any evidence of association with anyone connected to the group that was doing independent expenditures.  But they did not do any coordination of independent expenditures.  They never had any evidence about the individual named and any potential independent expenditures, nor did they destroy any evidence related to this individual.<blockquote> <p><hr> <p> <B>AUDIOTAPE<p> <p> October 6. 1992</B><p> <p> Came back to the office and met with [name omitted] from the National Rifle Association at three o'clock. <I>He showed me the piece the National Rifle Association is going to send out hitting [name omitted].

With more and more crime I think you're going to see a situation where People will think gun registration is the answer.  It isn't going to solve these problems.

In the substituted passage, Senator Packwood distances himself from the NRA and their goals, and does not mention that he was counting on the NRA's support.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he was probably responsible for deleting the information from the audiotape and substituting the information that appears in the Cormack transcript, because he did not want the press to know about his negotiations with the NRA, and that he was talking with the NRA about the mailing they were going to send to their members.  The entry that was substituted, which he says is accurate, was put in to fill the space, although it obviously would not fill the whole blank space left by the deletion.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood assumed that the meeting with the individual from the NRA actually took place, although he did not recall it.  He could think of no reason why he would have recorded such a detailed summary of the meeting if it actually had not taken place.<p> <p> <p>       c.   Entries Referring to Senator Packwood's Negotiations with the Oregon Citizens Alliance During his 1992 Campaign<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he deleted every reference to the Oregon Citizens Alliance which he could find, because this would be an explosive subject in Oregon.  At least five such entries were deleted.<p> <p>     During his 1992 campaign, Senator Packwood was accused by the media of making a deal with the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), a conservative group, that they would not run a candidate against him in return for certain promises. Senator Packwood consistently denied these accusations.  Senator Packwood's diary tapes for 1992 and 1993 contain a number of entries discussing what could be characterized as negotiations with the OCA by others on Senator Packwood's behalf.  These entries do not appear on the Cormack transcript, and in some cases, entries have been added that deny any deal was ever made! with the OCA.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that there never was a 'deal' with the OCA, and that he added information to the Cormack transcript to emphasize that for the benefit of the press.<p> <p> <p>         d.   Entries Referring to Contacts with Committee Members by Senator Packwood During the Committee's Inquiry<p> <p>      There are a number of entries on the 1992 audiotapes, which do not appear on the Cormack transcript, referring to conversations by Senator Packwood with members of the Committee concerning the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he deleted these entries from his diary tapes because he was afraid that if the press obtained them, they would suggest a "Republican conspiracy" in connection with the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p> <p>         e.   Entries About Senator Packwood Accepting Contributions to his Legal Defense Fund from Lobbyists<p> <p>     There are several entries in the 1993 diary tapes related to Senator Packwood's acceptance or solicitation of contributions to his legal defense fund from lobbyists visiting his Senate office. At least one of these entries gives the impression that a group contributed to his legal defense fund in order to get or stay in his good graces.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he attempted to remove any references to contributions to his legal defense fund by lobbyists, because the press would attempt to make corrupt, illegal, and immoral inferences from them about the way politics work.  He stated that it is perfectly legal, ethical, and moral for a group, even one that has opposed you in the past, to come in and make a contribution.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood denied any improper linkage between his acceptance of contributions to his legal defense fund and the conduct of his official Senate duties.<p> <p>         <H4>5. Findings</H4><p> <p>            a. Reliability of the Diaries<p> <p>       Senate Ethics Counsel finds that from 1969 through 1993, Senator Packwood kept detailed daily diaries. More specifically, for the diaries covering the period from January 1, 1989 through November 21, 1993, Senator Packwood recorded, often in minute detail, events in his professional and personal life, as well as his thoughts and feelings on a wide range of subjects, covering both his professional and personal life. Counsel finds that despite Senator Packwood's protestations about the unreliability of his diaries, these diaries were in fact an attempt by Senator Packwood to accurately record, from his perspective, events which he witnessed or in which he participated, and his thoughts and feelings about a variety of subjects.<p> <p>       While, as Senator Packwood points out, his recollection or assessment of events at the time may in some instances turn out to be inaccurate, or differ from the recollection of others, that does not mean that Senator Packwood did not set out to record events and perceptions as accurately as he could. Counsel finds that while Senator Packwood's diaries may not always be complete or accurate in every respect as a historical account of events, they are certainly accurate as a contemporaneous reflection of his perception of events, and his thoughts and feelings about a broad array of subjects.<p> <p>       Counsel notes that Senator Packwood made arrangements to leave his diaries to a historical trust. This fact, together with the sheer comprehensive nature of the diary entries, which record everything from Presidential briefings to the most mundane details of Senator Packwood's personal habits, is powerful evidence that Senator Packwood himself intended his diaries to be an accurate contemporaneous reflection of his perception of events, professional and personal, and his contemporaneous thoughts and feelings on many subjects.<p> <p>       Senate Ethics Counsel concludes that this contemporaneous record created by Senator Packwood is in fact reliable evidence of the events that it memorializes, as perceived by Senator Packwood at the time he recorded them, and of his contemporaneous thoughts and feelings.<p> <p> <p>         b. Alteration of the Diaries<p> <p>       Senate Ethics Counsel finds that as of December 1, 199 2, Senator Packwood was on notice that he was the subject of the Committee's inquiry into allegations of misconduct. After that time, Senator Packwood had an obligation of trust to the Senate, irrespective of any legal obligation which might attach, not to alter or destroy any documents or evidence in his possession or control that could be relevant to the subject of the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p>       There is no dispute that substantial portions of the entries for Senator Packwood's 1992 and 1993 diaries did not make it from the original contemporaneous audiotape onto the transcripts typed by Cathy Cormack. Although a large number of these entries appear to have been skipped over, paraphrased, or otherwise changed by Ms. Cormack in her rush to complete the diaries in the late summer and early fall of 1993, Senator Packwood himself testified that he deleted from his audiotapes most of the entries where corresponding entries were substituted on the typed transcript.[fn 160] Many of the entries falling into this category dealt with matters that were directly related to the Committee's inquiry or that raised questions about possible misconduct falling under the Committee's jurisdiction.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood intentionally altered many of the diary passages that related to the Committee's inquiry or raised questions about possible misconduct within the Committee's jurisdiction, and that he did so after he was on notice that he was the subject of the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p> <p>        c.   Senator Packwood's Motivation for Making Changes to His Diary<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has testified that he took out entries from his 1992 and 1993 diary tapes because he feared that once they went to his attorneys, they would be leaked to the press.  He testified that he did not act out of a desire to keep the deleted entries from the Committee, but that his sole motivation was to prevent entries that could be embarrassing to himself or others from getting to the press through his attorneys.  Several factors should be considered in evaluating this testimony.<p> <p>     First, if Senator Packwood were truly concerned about embarrassing entries in his diaries leaking to the press, he could simply have deleted those entries.  There was no need to substitute passages in their place, passages that were often self-serving or exculpatory.  Indeed, in one instance, while he deleted a passage that would be highly embarrassing to himself and others if it became public, he substituted in its place an entry that would have been equally embarrassing to another staff member if it had become public.  He offered no explanation for his substitution of entries, other than that it was the result of his compulsive habit of dictating.<p> <p>     The nature of the entries that Senator Packwood took out of his diary is also a strong indication that his motivation may not have been simply to keep entries from leaking to the press.  A good number of these entries relate specifically to the subject of the Committee's inquiry - either the women involved, the issue of intimidation, or the progress of the Committee's inquiry. Indeed, Senator Packwood changed entries which related to the subject of intimidation of witnesses well after his own attorneys had instructed him to collect and forward entries related to the intimidation issue.  Many of the remaining entries that were changed raise questions about other possible misconduct by Senator Packwood that would be subject to the Committee's jurisdiction.  The nature of the entries deleted points to the conclusion that Senator Packwood set out to delete not only those possibly incriminating entries relating to the Committee's inquiry, but any entries that might trigger further inquiry by the Committee into other areas of possible misconduct.[fn 161]<p> <p>       Further, Senator Packwood made no changes to his already- transcribed pre-1992 diaries, as he did to his untranscribed 1992-1993 tapes.  This contrast in treatment between the pre-1992 diaries and the 1992-93 tapes is underscored by the fact that Senator Packwood deleted several passages in his 1993 diary tapes referring to his consensual relationship with a staffer, (S- l),and his concern that she might be trying to "build a case" against him.  Yet he did not delete an entry in November 1989 which describes in explicit detail how he and the staffer had sex on his office floor, although the deleted entries make it clear that he knew when this incident took place.<p> <p>     Additionally, Senator Packwood stated that he was concerned that his diaries would be leaked once he turned them over to his attorneys.  Yet the evidence indicates that with the exception of the October-November excerpts from 1992 dealing with the intimidation issue, his attorneys never asked him to turn over any significant portion of his diaries to them in toto, although he did provide them with selected entries from his diary during the course of 1993.[fn 162] Indeed, his attorneys did not receive any of the diary, other than the selected excerpts that Senator Packwood provided to them, until after his deposition was interrupted in October 1993 when the Committee requested the diaries.  At that time, they first received the diary transcript covering the years 1969 through 1991, followed by 1992-1993 transcripts as Ms. Cormack typed them.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has emphasized to the Committee that he did not destroy the original audiotapes, and that if the Committee had gotten up to 1992 and 1993 in its original review of the diaries, he would have informed the Committee of the changes.  He overlooks the fact that at the same time that Committee Counsel was reviewing the earlier years of the diary in October 1993, he was permitting Ms. Cormack to type transcripts for 1992 and 1993 <B>from the altered audiotape</B>, and was turning over to his attorneys transcripts prepared from these altered tapes.  At that time, Senator Packwood knew that the Committee wanted to review his diaries through 1993.  And even after he received the Committee's subpoena asking for diaries and tapes, he continued to have Ms. Cormack type from the altered audiotapes, which transcripts he provided to his attorneys.<p> <p>     Had he intended for the Committee to review a transcript prepared from the original, unchanged diary tapes, he would not have had Ms. Cormack typing from the altered audiotapes.  It is also significant that Senator Packwood did not tell his own attorneys that the transcripts Ms. Cormack was typing, and that he was providing to them during this period after October 6, 1993, had been altered.  Indeed, even as late as October 20, 1993, Senator Packwood remained silent as his attorneys informed the Committee that some of the transcripts for 1992, which unbeknownst to them had been typed from the altered tapes, would soon be available for review by the Committee.[fn 163]<p> <p>       Senator Packwood has also emphasized that the Committee received the original audiotapes, and thus was not misled.  It is true that, after a lengthy court battle, the Committee received the original audiotapes.  The issue, however, is not whether the Committee eventually received evidence to which it was lawfully entitled,[fn 164] but whether Senator Packwood intentionally created a second version of that evidence after he knew or should have known the Committee wanted it, and whether as part of that process he destroyed evidence.  Any improper conduct occurred when Senator Packwood made the changes to his diaries or destroyed evidence as part of that process, regardless of whether the Committee eventually received the authentic version, or regardless of whether the Committee avoided the possibility of being actually misled, because it successfully obtained the originals.<p> <p> <p>        d.   The Timing of the Changes<p> <p>     For the purpose of determining whether Senator Packwood engaged in improper conduct, it is not necessary to make a specific finding regarding the timing of his changes to the diary.  The timing of the changes, however, may reflect Senator Packwood's state of mind in making the changes.<p> <p>     The Committee's inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct began December 1, 1992.  On February 4, 1993 the inquiry was expanded to include possible witness intimidation. Thereafter, on March 29, and July 16, 1993 the Committee sent document requests to Senator Packwood requesting information and documents concerning these allegations.  The information sought by these requests included information such as that contained in some of the diary entries altered by the Senator.  Senator Packwood has testified that he began changing his 1992 audiotapes beginning in January 1993 and continuing through April 1993, and that later, in late July or early August 1993, he began changing his 1993 audiotapes.  Thus, even if one accepts his testimony as to the timing of the changes, Senator Packwood was intentionally altering materials related to the Committee's inquiry after he knew or should have known that the Committee had sought or would likely seek these materials.<p> <p>     Thereafter, on October 6, 1993 at the interruption of his deposition the Committee requested specific periods in their entirety from his diary dating from 1969, specifically including the period from August 1989 thru October 6, 1993.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has testified that he made most of the changes, with a few exceptions, in the first seven months of 1993, well before his deposition was interrupted in October 1993 and the Committee specifically requested his diaries.  Senator Packwood's testimony in this regard must, however, be evaluated in the context of other evidence.<p> <p>      If the diary changes were made after the interruption of Senator Packwood's deposition on October 6, 1993, this could account for the fact that Senator Packwood only made changes on the untranscribed tapes for the years 1992 and 1993: once the Committee asked for the diaries, and Senator Packwood turned over the already typed transcripts through 1991 to his attorneys, he could not make any changes to those entries.  But he still had the audiotapes for 1992 and 1993, most of which had not yet been transcribed.<p> <p>       Senator Packwood testified that he felt compelled to fill up the space left on an audiotape after deleting passages.  However, an alternative explanation for the substitution of entries in the place of deleted entries could be that these changes were, in fact, made to the transcript after it was typed by Ms. Cormack. It does make sense that one would want to fill up a blank space after deleting entries from a typed transcript, in order to hide the fact that entries had been taken out.  While some of the changes were made on the tapes themselves, since Ms. Cormack noticed the Senator's tape changes as she typed, she testified that in the two week period from mid-to-late October 1993, on more than one occasion, Senator Packwood brought back to her pages she had already transcribed that he had subsequently changed, and asked her to make those changes.  She could not remember what time period these changes covered. While the Senator says he does not believe he changed any pre-deposition entries during this period, he testified that it is possible that he did change entries from either 1992 or pre-October 1993 as they came off Ms. Cormack's typewriter, <B>after</B> his deposition was interrupted on October 6, 1993 and <B>after</B> he received the Committee's subpoena on October 21, 1993.<p> <p>     Consistent with the evidence, one could reasonably conclude as follows: that after the Committee asked for his diaries on October 6, 1993, Senator Packwood went to Ms. Cormack and retrieved the untyped tapes for 1992 and 1993, and mentioned the possibility of a subpoena as he did so;[fn 165] that he deleted or changed some information from the audiotapes,[fn 166] and returned them to Ms. Cormack a few days later;[fn 167] that as he received the typed transcripts from her, and discovered that there was additional material that he needed to take out, he instructed Ms. Cormack to do so, filling up the blank spaces, or evening out the pages with benign or exculpatory information to disguise the deletions.<p> <p>     If one concludes that Senator Packwood made the changes during this time period, it is equally clear that Senator Packwood was intentionally altering materials related to the Committee's inquiry when he knew or should have known that the Committee had sought or would likely seek these materials.<p> <p>        Counsel also notes that in his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood stated that he finally told his attorneys about the existence of the original backup audiotapes, and the fact that he had made changes to the 1992 and 1993 tapes, after he received the subpoena from the Department of Justice on November 19, 1993, because he thought the Department of Justice might need them.[fn 168] However, the Committee's subpoena, which the Senator received almost a month earlier, specifically asked for diary transcripts and tapes for the years 1989 through 1993. Only days before he received the Department of Justice subpoena, when he was discussing with the Committee the possibility that he could resign and thereby avoid the Committee's subpoena, Senator Packwood told Senator McConnell, then the Committee's Vice Chairman, that he wanted a "window of opportunity" in which to destroy his diaries.[fn 169] Such a window would have been created if the Committee's subpoena expired before the Department of Justice subpoena was served. However, the Department of Justice subpoena was served before he could resign. It is reasonable to conclude from this sequence of events that Senator Packwood was willing to resign if it meant that he could destroy his diaries, and that he only told his attorneys about the existence of original backup tapes, and that he had altered the tapes for 1992 and 1993, when the destruction of his diaries was no longer an option.<p> <p> <p>         e. Destruction of Evidence<p> <p>       Senator Packwood testified that he made changes to a duplicate copy of his diary tapes, and that he then made a copy of this changed duplicate to give to Ms. Cormack to type.[fn 170] As she finished typing, she destroyed her copy, and he destroyed his, keeping instead the original, unaltered diary tape, which did not correspond to the typed transcript. If the Committee had access to the altered diary tapes, it would better be able to establish what deletions were made to the tapes by Senator Packwood, as these would not be on the tapes, as opposed to what entries were simply not typed by Ms. Cormack and, importantly, what changes were made by Senator Packwood to the transcript after it was typed.[fn 171] Even accepting Senator Packwood's testimony about the timing of the changes to his diaries, he continued to allow Ms. Cormack to destroy her copy of the altered tapes, and he continued to destroy his, <B>after</B> the Committee asked to review his diaries, <B>and after</B> he received the Committee's subpoena, which specifically asked for all audiotapes as well as transcripts. All of the altered tapes must have been destroyed, since none were produced to the Court in response to the Committee's subpoena. Likewise, since no transcript pages marked by Senator Packwood for changes by Ms. Cormack were provided to the Court, these must also have been destroyed by Senator Packwood and/or Ms. Cormack.<p> <p>     It is clear from the October 20, 1993 letter from Senator Packwood's attorneys to the Committee, stating that only half of the 1992 tapes had been typed and were ready for review by Committee counsel, and from Cathy Cormack's testimony that the two week period of mid-to-late October was part of the "crunch time" for typing the transcripts, that a significant number of altered tapes were transcribed, and the <B>tapes destroyed</B>, after the Committee specifically asked for the diaries, and after the Committee more specifically subpoenaed all diary tapes as well as diary transcripts.  Thus, Senator Packwood created an altered version of his diaries wherein a significant number of the alterations related specifically to the Committee's inquiry or to matters within the Committee's jurisdiction, and then destroyed the evidence (the altered tapes) which was critical to a determination as to the purpose of the changes, which purpose the Senator has testified had no relationship to the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p>       f.   Reliance on the Advice of Counsel<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has repeatedly stated that he felt free to alter his diaries during 1993 because his attorneys made the determination that the Committee was not entitled to them, and that, in making those changes, he relied upon the fact that his attorneys were not providing the Committee with any diary excerpts in response to the Committee's requests.  Senator Packwood testified that his attorneys made the decision to withhold his diaries from the Committee in response to its document requests.  Despite repeated questioning, he could not elaborate on precisely what his attorneys told him on this subject.  Nevertheless, this claim, that his attorneys made the decision about what to provide to the Committee, is corroborated by Mr. Fitzpatrick of Arnold &amp; Porter.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood, however, was not charged by the Committee with a failure to turn over his diaries to the Committee in response to its requests.  The Committee charged Senator Packwood with intentionally altering his diaries after he knew or should have known that the Committee had sought or would likely seek them.  Senator Packwood was certainly entitled to rely upon his attorneys' decision to withhold his diaries on the grounds of privilege, even if his attorneys' judgment was later proven to be incorrect.  But Senator Packwood's attorneys did <B>not</B> advise him that it was permissible to alter his diaries, privileged or not. Indeed, his attorneys did not even know that he was altering his diaries until November 21, 1993, the day before they resigned. Senator Packwood cannot shift responsibility for the alteration of his diaries to his attorneys.<p> <p>      Moreover, Counsel notes that Senator Packwood began changing his diaries in January 1993, at least two months before he received the Committee's document request on March 29, 1993. Senator Packwood told the Committee that his attorneys made the decision not to turn over his diaries to the Committee sometime <B>after</B> the Committee's March 29, 1993 document request.  Even accepting Senator Packwood's assertion that he felt free to change his diaries because of his counsel's decision not to turn them over to the Committee, there was no such advice to rely upon when he was changing the 1992 tapes during January, February, and most of March. 1993.<p> <p>     It should not be overlooked that Senator Packwood is himself a lawyer.  He knew as early as December 1992, when his attorneys asked him for excerpts from his diaries touching on the intimidation issue, and as he provided them with other excerpts from the diary throughout early 1993, that his attorneys considered his diaries important to his defense to the extent they contained material relevant to the Committee's inquiry. It is certainly reasonable to expect that Senator Packwood could anticipate that the Committee might also want access to his diaries at some point.  Indeed, an entry in Senator Packwood's original diary audiotape (which does not appear in the Cormack transcript, dated March 29, 1993 because the Senator deleted it), the same day that Senator Packwood received the Committee's document request, makes it clear that Senator Packwood was concerned that the Committee might get access to his diaries. Those diaries contained information that was directly relevant to the Committee's inquiry.  Regardless of his attorneys' determination about what he could withhold from the Committee, Senator Packwood knew the importance of preserving the integrity of anything that might at some point become evidence in an ongoing inquiry, and the consequences of altering any such potential evidence.<p> <p> <p>        g.   Conclusions<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood intentionally changed entries in his diaries that related to the subject of the Committee's inquiry, or to areas of possible misconduct that were subject to the Committee's jurisdiction, at a time when he was the subject of an inquiry into misconduct by the Committee, and when he knew or should have known that the Committee would likely seek or had sought those diaries as evidence in its inquiry.<p> <p>     It is not necessary to Counsel's finding of improper conduct to also find that Senator Packwood acted for the specific purpose of obstructing the Committee's inquiry.  Such a determination is better left to other authorities, and Counsel defers to their eventual judgment on this matter.  Counsel does find, however, that Senator Packwood purposefully selected and changed entries in his diary tapes for 1992 and 1993 that he knew were relevant to the Committee's inquiry, and that could be incriminating to him, along with other entries that could result in Committee inquiry into other activity.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's actions were contemptuous of and subverted the Senate's Constitutional self-disciplinary process.  By delegation of authority from the Senate, the Committee is specifically empowered to obtain evidence from Members and others who are the subject of Committee inquiry, and it is entitled to rely on the integrity of such evidence.  Indeed, the entire process is compromised and rendered wholly without value if persons subject to the Committee's inquiry, or witnesses in an inquiry, are allowed to jeopardize the integrity of evidence coming before the Committee.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's actions constitute an abuse of his position as a United States Senator, are a violation of his duty of trust to the Senate, and constitute improper conduct reflecting discredit upon the United states Senate.<p> <p>     Counsel suggests that the matter of diary alteration is appropriate for referral to the Department of Justice for its attention pursuant to Committee Rule 8(a).<p> <p> <H3>Endnotes</H3><tt><font size=-1> <p> Endnotes<p> <p> 147.  This privilege log identified memoranda, but it did not indicate in any way that the memoranda included diary excerpts or pages.<p> <p> 148.  It is very clear, however, that the privilege log contains absolutely no reference to or mention of diaries.<p> <p> 149.  Senator Packwood had previously testified at his deposition that his attorneys asked him in late July or early August to have the rest of hi6 diaries, i.e., the entries for 1992 and 1993, transcribed, and that it was this request that caused him to go back and change his 1993 diary tapes, out of fear that the transcribed diaries would be leaked from his attorneys' office if they should ever be provided to them.<p> <p> 150.  This indicates that Arnold &amp; Porter received on this date the transcribed diaries up through the end of January 1992, as that is when the pages cease to be numbered.  It also indicates that entries after January 1992 (other than the entries for November and December 1992 previously provided to them in January 1993) were not completed until after that date.<p> <p> 151.   Examples include lengthy discourses on food, music, movies, and Senator Packwood's relationships with and observations about various women.<p> <p> 152.  In fact, Ms. Cormack testified that she could conceive of no circumstances under which she would have typed the entry as it appears in the transcript, had she heard the entry on the audiotape.<p> <p> 153.  The deleted entry corroborates information from another witness, who told the staff that the former staffer/complainant told him one day at work that the former staffer had gotten drunk at her apartment and spent the night on her couch, and that she was telling the witness about this because she was worried that the former staffer might tell others that he had spent the night with her.<p> <p> 154.  The diary entry for November 29, 1989 contains a graphic description of Senator Packwood and the staffer making love in his Senate office.<p> <p> 155.  The staffer was interviewed by the staff, but would not answer questions about whether she was ever the subject of any unwanted sexual advances by Senator Packwood.<p> <p> 156.  Ms. Cormack testified that she would not have typed the first and third passages as they appear on the transcript, had she heard what was on the audiotape.  Although it was possible that she skipped over the second passage, this entry did not fall into any of the categories that she was "boiling down" for the sake of time.<p> <p> 157.  Nor could Ms. Cormack, who did not even know who the former Ethics Committee Staff Director was.<p> <p> 158.  Ms. Cormack testified that the first passage was not the type of entry that she would have left out of the transcript as she was typing, although it was possible that she could have missed it as she typed the transcript. She did not believe she would intentionally have left it out.<p> <p> 159.  Senator Packwood stated that he added this information to the tape sometime between January and April of 1993.<p> <p> 160.  Of course, if the Committee had the altered tapes from which Ms. Cormack transcribed the 1992 and 1993 diaries, it would be better able to pinpoint which entries Ms. Cormack skipped over, as they would still be on the tape, and which entries Senator Packwood deleted, as they would be missing from the tape, and which entries were altered after the  transcripts had been typed.  Despite his knowledge as of October 6, 1993 that the Committee wanted to see his diaries, and his receipt of a subpoena on October 21, 1993 for all of his diary tapes and transcripts, Senator Packwood never instructed Ms. Cormack not to continue her usual practice of erasing her copy after she finished typing it. Senator Packwood testified that he also erased his copy of the changed tape, keeping instead the original, unchanged diary tape.<p> <p> 161.  While the deleted entries about the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which raise questions about his campaign tactics, do not appear to implicate Senator Packwood in any official misconduct, it is not clear whether this was not a matter of concern to Senator Packwood at the time he made the changes to these entries, given the fact that he was also changing other entries related to the campaign, dealing with possible coordinated expenditures.  Three other deleted entries related to dinner with his attorneys and meetings with a friend who was a judge do not appear to relate to any potential official misconduct.  The fact that not all of the deleted entries related to the Ethics Committee's inquiry or possible misconduct, however, does not preclude the reasonable conclusion, supported by the clear weight of the evidence, that many or most of the deletions that Senator Packwood admitted he made appear to have been made with the Ethics Committee in mind.<p> <p> 162.  ~Once the Committee asked to review his diaries in October 1993, Senator Packwood gave his attorneys copies of the transcripts for 1992 and 1993 prepared from the altered tapes as Ms. Cormack typed it, to be reviewed by his attorneys and provided to the Committee.  He did not, however, tell his attorneys that these transcripts had been typed from altered tapes.  As late as October 20, 1993, Senator Packwood's attorneys wrote the Committee advising it that some of the transcript for 1992 would be forthcoming for the Committee's review.<p> <p> 163.  Moreover, if Senator Packwood made changes to his diaries for benign purposes, why did he not simply listen to the tapes and identify those changes for the Committee after he lost in Court, instead of leaving to the Committee the task of transcribing his tapes and comparing them to the Cormack transcript?  He was specifically invited to do so by Senate Legal Counsel.<p> <p> 164.  Of course, all such evidence was not received by the Committee, because the altered tapes were destroyed.<p> <p> 165.  At her third deposition, over a year after the events in question, Ms. Cormack recalled that Senator Packwood picked up audiotapes from her in September 1993, not October.  This is consistent with Senator Packwood's testimony.  However, Senator Packwood's diary for October 9, 1993, indicates that he dropped off the tapes to Ms. Cormack on that date, and asked her to type seven of them right away, and another diary entry for October 10, 1993 also discusses her rushing to type the tapes.  Both of these October entries were subsequently changed by Senator Packwood, and there are no similar entries in September.  Correspondence from Senator Packwood's attorney, dated October 20, 1993, indicates that as of that date, Ms. Cormack had only typed about half of the diaries for 1992.  This is consistent with Ms. Cormack's testimony, describing the two week period of mid-to- late October as part of the "crunch time," when she was pushing hard to complete the tapes.<p> <p> 166.  The Senator has testified that during December 1992 and 1993 as he was listening to the 1992-93 untranscribed tapes he believes he may have made notes of the location of embarrassing passages which he would not want to get into the hands of the press.  If he had this information at hand, the Senator could quickly locate and delete or change the passages.<p> <p> 167.  Senator Packwood destroyed his copy of the changed audiotapes, and never instructed Ms. Cormack not to destroy hers, even after receiving the Committee's subpoena.  Thus, it is impossible to make a full accounting of exactly which entries were deleted from the tape by Senator Packwood, which entries Ms. Cormack listened to but simply did not type, and which entries Senator Packwood added by making changes to transcript rather than tape.<p> <p> 168.  The Committee's subpoena of October 20, 1993 specifically asked for all tapes as well as transcripts. The Senator explained that the DOJ subpoena jogged him to action where the Committee subpoena had not because it involved a possible criminal issue and he did not know what that entailed. It is unclear why the Ethics Committee subpoena, approved by a 94 to 6 vote of his Senate colleagues, did not carry the same force with Senator Packwood.<p> <p> 169.  Senator McConnell immediately informed Senator Bryan (then Committee chairman) and Committee Counsel of this conversation.<p> <p> 170.  Ms. Cormack did not complete her transcription of the altered tapes until at least November 9, 1993.<p> <p> 171.  This is significant because Ms. Cormack has testified that during the two week period in mid-to-late October 1993, when she was pushing to complete the diaries, on a few occasions Senator Packwood brought her diary pages she had already typed, with instructions on changes to be made to them. If the Committee had the altered tapes, this would help establish whether certain entries were changed after the Committee had asked to review his diaries on October 6, 1993, during this mid-to-late October period. <p> </tt></font>><P><UL><UL> <a href=pack1.htm#tab><LI><I>To table of contents</I></a><br> <a href=pack5.htm><LI><I>To next section</I></a></ul></ul><center>  <hr size=7><P>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys.

PennWell Publishing Company is a highly diversified global business
information provider serving a broad spectrum of industries and

a company that today serves computer, laser, electronic, municipal,
energy and environmental fields through business and technical
magazines, along with conferences, exhibitions, books, maps, database
resources, and market research for these markets.
<P>
The PennWell commitment to editorial integrity and quality continues
as PennWell broadens its base of operations through carefully
planned growth and diversification.

The annual DA/DSM DistribuTECH Conference focuses on the dramatic technological and economic changes impacting the business of utility distribution management, system design, operation, telecommunications and marketing.  Issues affecting delivery of electric power, natural gas, water and other ''commodities'' are explored. The conference provides a forum to exchange ideas and experiences. Content, however, has a distinctly practical and leading-edge emphasis. Papers and Sessions are chosen for their educational value.  Submissions are favored which give the audience knowledge and tools that can be put to immediate use on the job. The program is enhanced with a full compliment of spouse/guest activities, weekend events, technical tours and recreational opportunities. <P>

<P>PennWell Maps has been plotting, drafting, and printing maps showing pipelines, electric transmission lines, oil and gas fields, power plants, refineries, petrochemical plants, platforms, terminals and more for nearly 30 years.  Researched and documented by PennWells editorial and cartographic staff, our maps feature data provided by individual operating and power-producing companies themselves.

<P><H3>PennWell Digital Pipeline and Electric Power Data for CAD and GIS</H3>

<STRONG>What Is GIS?</STRONG>
<P>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the means to build and access relationships between graphical map information and databases that describe the features and elements of the map.
<P>
<P>See where a pipeline or utility line route lays in relationship to nearby cities, highways, and railroads...or where that pipeline or utility line intersects with another...or how lines are routed in relationship to heavy power users.  GIS technology and PennWell information enables you to see those relationships right on your desktop computer.    
<P>
<P><STRONG>What can I do with all this data? </STRONG>
<P>PennWell Maps, Database, and Directories customers have requested information for specific regions, states, and even counties.  Until now, that data had to be extracted from several sources and provided separately on diskettes or in print format.
<P>
<P>PennWells Data Packages for the Pipeline and Utility Industries combine real world map data with petroleum and electric utility company details and statistics in one accessible, easy-to-use package including ArcView 2 from ESRI.
<P>
<menu>
   Use the data to create special reports<BR>
   Analyze your business potential <BR>
   Assess your competition<BR>
   Visualize environmental problems and solutions<BR>
   Add your own details to the maps and print to your laser printer<BR>
</menu>
<P>PennWell Publishing Company has been providing information to the energy industry for more than eighty years through the <EM>Oil & Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine, Electric Light & Power, Power Engineering,</EM> and now <EM>Independent Energy</EM>, and <EM>Utility Automation</EM> and many other publications including directories, buyers guides and market reports.  We have been producing wall maps and atlases for the energy industry for more than thirty years.  Our customers continue to rely on us to provide the best information possible in the most user-friendly formats.  

<P>To keep pace with the powerful changes in technology and our customers demands, PennWell joined forces with experts in digital mapping technology and user interface design.  
<P>
<P><STRONG>Topographic Mapping Company</STRONG> of Oklahoma City provided expertise in refining our digital map data so that it is useful for both CAD and GIS users.  Through a marketing partnership with TMC, PennWell data is available from both PennWell and Topographic Mapping Company (800-654-3219).
<P>
<P><STRONG>Eagle Information Mapping Company</STRONG> in Houston joined our project in 1995, providing user interface design for the ArcView packages and lending long-time energy industry and programming expertise to the product.  (714-662-9167 email: smoravec@eagle.com)

<blockquote>

<H3>XVI. GENERAL RATE POLICY</H3><P>

<blockquote>
The publisher reserves the right to insert the word "advertisement" when, in the publisher's opinion, an advertisement resembles editorial material.  Advertisers and agencies assume liability for all content (including text, representation and illustrations) of advertisements, and also assume responsibility for any claim arising therefrom made against the publisher.  The publisher reserves the right to reject any advertising that does not conform to publication standards.  Publisher cannot be held responsible for circumstances beyond his/her control, such as a postal strike, act of God, action by any governmental, or quasi-governmental entity.<P>

Orders are accepted subject to change in rates upon notice from the publisher.  Advertisers will be short-rated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they do not use the amount of space upon which their billings have been based.<P>

Advertisers will be rebated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they have used sufficient space to warrant a higher frequency.  Publisher reserves the right to hold the advertiser and/or its advertising agency jointly and severally liable for such monies as are due and payable to the publisher.<P>

<blockquote>
The publisher reserves the right to insert the word "advertisement" when, in the publisher's opinion, an advertisement resembles editorial material.  Advertisers and agencies assume liability for all content (including text, representation and illustrations) of advertisements, and also assume responsibility for any claim arising therefrom made against the publisher.  The publisher reserves the right to reject any advertising that does not conform to publication standards.  Publisher cannot be held responsible for circumstances beyond his/her control, such as a postal strike, act of God, action by any governmental, or quasi-governmental entity.<P>

Orders are accepted subject to change in rates upon notice from the publisher.  Advertisers will be short-rated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they do not use the amount of space upon which their billings have been based.<P>

Advertisers will be rebated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they have used sufficient space to warrant a higher frequency.  Publisher reserves the right to hold the advertiser and/or its advertising agency jointly and severally liable for such monies as are due and payable to the publisher.<P>

<b>UU203  Information Requirements for the Competitive Utility Environment</b><br> 
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Monday 0830 - 173  $355</b></i><br>
<P>Competition, downsizing and deregulation are words that were unheard of at utilities until the last few years.  Now they are commonplace.  They will also change, forever, the way utilities do business.  Those that don't change successfully will not be doing business at some point in the future.  To compete in a competitive environment, utilities must develop an enterprise-wide information network that connects all areas of the utility from generation to the customer.  This requires a strategic approach that starts with a strategic information technology strategy.  Accurate timely information to support the business objectives of the utility must become a strategic corporate asset.  The seminar will explore development of a strategic information technology strategy competing in a regulated environment, technology as a tool to meet business objectives, how timely information will make the difference, organizational issues and how to proceed from where you are today.

<b>UU204  Communications Techniques for Distribution Management Systems</b><br>
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Sunday  0830 - 1730  $355</b></i><br>
<P>For utilities to compete and prosper, they must deliver better services at lower prices to their customers.  The focus for utilities for the foreseeable future will be the distribution system.  Automation of the distribution system offers many business and operational benefits to utilities.  Automation requires communication systems that can evolve to meet future requirements.  Nowhere has technology been changing as rapidly as in communications.  This seminar will investigate: communications issues, communication technologies, standards, system architecture (public/private/hybrid), expansion of communication systems to meet future requirements, and case studies of successful communication systems being deployed by utilities.  The participants will gain an understanding of what communication systems and standards are being implemented and the pros and cons of the different systems.<p>

<b>UU205  Customer Interface Issues</b><br>
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Sunday 0830-1730  $355</b></i><br>
<p>In today's mature electric utility marketplace, utilities are looking toward cost savings and expense management, rather than growth, to produce new profits.  Utilities must encourage intelligent use of electricity to reduce reliance on costly generation options to respond to peaks and unpredictable demands.  Advances in computer and communications technology make it feasible to offer new services to customers while enabling utilities to reduce costs.  If properly planned and implemented, both the utility and the customer will profit.  This seminar explores automated meter reading, its cost justification and how the resulting two-way communication system can be used to offer additional services to your customers.  It will discuss business and competitive issues, current and future technology, additional customer services and actual case studies.<p>

"Fiber-Optic Networks - How Utilities Can Participate and Profit in Communications, Control, and Competitive Services."<br>
<b><i>Wednesday, January 29th	0830-1200 BF.1 $295</i></b><br>
<blockquote>Utilities need both a short- and a long-term strategic plan to establish a fiber-optic communications infrastructure in the open-competition marketplace approved by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  This infrastructure promises benefits for utilities and their customers.  Many utilities have installed fiber-optic networks but do not have the expertise to financially optimize their communications advantages.  To achieve that goal, utilities are partnering with network and service providers to enhance their own energy monitoring systems as well as internal and external communications platforms.  More important, these alliances are delivering revenue-earning voice, video, and data services over fiber to homes and businesses.  This Summit will explain how fiber-optic networks can furnish utilities with the basis for:<p>

<LI>	Process control and communications cost reductions.
<LI>	Service packaging and competitive operational advantages.
<LI>	New sources of revenues via diversification.<p></blockquote>

<i>Energy Service Bureaux - the UK Experience and Their Criticality as a     Value Added Service in    the USA Following Deregulation	Panel</i><br>
Service Bureaux has been a major feature of the utility management scene in the UK since the late 1980's.  These services have primarily been contracted and paid for by end users, principally large organizations with multiple premises.  However, they are now often funded by utilities of suppliers (energy marketers) as Value Added Service to differentiate their product.  A particular benefit is that this service develops and maintains long term customer loyalty.  The Bureaux provides a wide range of outsourced services, fundamentally based around:<p>
<LI>electronic and paper based reporting to various levels of management
<LI>collection of utility data from meters and invoices, both manually and electronically
<LI>validation of metering data to minimize errors in customer billing
<LI>validation of invoices 
<LI>statistical analysis of data to identify consumption and cost saving opportunities
<LI>provision of services to competing utility retailers by a neutral services bureaux.<p>

<b>Wednesday 1030	ELB.4</b><br>
<i>Object Frameworks - Who is on the Bus?	Panel</i><br>
Competitiveness for utilities depends on a close relationship between the business model and the information systems which support the business.  A tight integration of applications and systems is required, along with the flexibility to swap out old technologies, rapidly add new business partners onto the value chain of networked systems, and easily reorganize processes around market changes.  Companies are increasingly switching away from new application development and maintenance to mostly purchased applications with a significantly increased focus on integration.  Few utilities, however, have a time-tested approach for systems integration.  Considerably different skills are required when connecting systems and applications which were not initially designed to work together.  The integration has to span not only the technical domains of the computer systems, but also the corporate business domain.  Frameworks based on object standards can do just that.  New Integration approaches are built around the Object Management Group's (OMG) standard called CORBA, or Common Object Request Broker Architecture.  The panelists will address the current status of the CORBA standard, CORBA integration projects in other vertical industries and the application of object frameworks to integrated distribution management.<p>

<b>Thursday  0800</b><br>
<i>PS.2  An Industry Town Meeting:  Part One</i><br>
<i>Past / Present / Future of the Energy Marketing Environment</i><br>
The year of the oil embargo - '1973' is often characterized as a seminal event for the power industry.  However, the last five years have been witness to enormous change - the rise and fall of demand-side management, the firm establishment of non-utility generators as alternative energy providers, and most importantly, a customer-led revolution toward competition - perhaps best characterized by the rapid emergence of power marketers.  The next five years will introduce even more significant change.  <p>
How do commercial and industrial customers view their current providers, why and what market changes do they anticipate?  Although regulatory efforts to restructure and deregulate the industry are still being considered, are they too little too late?  Just how far along have the energy markets already progressed toward a real competitive future?  Finally, what will the future look like?  Will communication-based networks obliterate the geographic boundaries of conventional utilities and firmly establish the 'virtual electronic utility'?  These industry experts will provide the answers.<p>
<i>Moderator:	Roger Levy</i><br>
<i>Participants:  Joe Ellis, TQS Research; Fred Pickel, Arthur Andersen National Utility Group; Nancy Day, New Energy Ventures, Inc.; Jim Andrus, ITRON</i><p>
<b>Thursday 1030</b><br>
<i>PS.3  An Industry Town Meeting:  Part Two</i><br>
<i>Utility Restructuring California PUC's Move to Competition (Invited)</i><br>
Although many utilities, consumers, and most of the vendor community are moving rapidly to support a competitive environment, state and federal regulators have not yet resolved the new rules of the game.  The new rules will determine the metering and communication requirements, what data is collected, who gets access, and how public policy related technology development and conservation program issues are resolved.  With over 30 states and the Federal government actively involved in the industry restructuring effort, uncertainty is growing over the potential outcomes.  This moderator led panel of regulators, legislative representatives, and commission staff will examine some of the most critical technology-related issues of restructuring.  Critical attention will be focused on the  new 'rules' from California that will undoubtedly influence other state and federal regulatory proceedings.<p>

The annual DA/DSM DistribuTECH Conference focuses on the dramatic technological and economic changes impacting the business of utility distribution management, system design, operation, telecommunications and marketing.  Issues affecting delivery of electric power, natural gas, water and other ''commodities'' are explored. The conference provides a forum to exchange ideas and experiences. Content, however, has a distinctly practical and leading-edge emphasis. Papers and Sessions are chosen for their educational value.  Submissions are favored which give the audience knowledge and tools that can be put to immediate use on the job. The program is enhanced with a full compliment of spouse/guest activities, weekend events, technical tours and recreational opportunities. <P>

<P><H3>PennWell Digital Pipeline and Electric Power Data for CAD and GIS</H3>

<STRONG>What Is GIS?</STRONG>
<P>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the means to build and access relationships between graphical map information and databases that describe the features and elements of the map.
<P>
<P>See where a pipeline or utility line route lays in relationship to nearby cities, highways, and railroads...or where that pipeline or utility line intersects with another...or how lines are routed in relationship to heavy power users.  GIS technology and PennWell information enables you to see those relationships right on your desktop computer.    
<P>
<P><STRONG>What can I do with all this data? </STRONG>
<P>PennWell Maps, Database, and Directories customers have requested information for specific regions, states, and even counties.  Until now, that data had to be extracted from several sources and provided separately on diskettes or in print format.
<P>
<P>PennWells Data Packages for the Pipeline and Utility Industries combine real world map data with petroleum and electric utility company details and statistics in one accessible, easy-to-use package including ArcView 2 from ESRI.
<P>
<menu>
   Use the data to create special reports<BR>
   Analyze your business potential <BR>
   Assess your competition<BR>
   Visualize environmental problems and solutions<BR>
   Add your own details to the maps and print to your laser printer<BR>
</menu>
<P>PennWell Publishing Company has been providing information to the energy industry for more than eighty years through the <EM>Oil & Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine, Electric Light & Power, Power Engineering,</EM> and now <EM>Independent Energy</EM>, and <EM>Utility Automation</EM> and many other publications including directories, buyers guides and market reports.  We have been producing wall maps and atlases for the energy industry for more than thirty years.  Our customers continue to rely on us to provide the best information possible in the most user-friendly formats.  

<P>To keep pace with the powerful changes in technology and our customers demands, PennWell joined forces with experts in digital mapping technology and user interface design.  
<P>
<P><STRONG>Topographic Mapping Company</STRONG> of Oklahoma City provided expertise in refining our digital map data so that it is useful for both CAD and GIS users.  Through a marketing partnership with TMC, PennWell data is available from both PennWell and Topographic Mapping Company (800-654-3219).
<P>
<P><STRONG>Eagle Information Mapping Company</STRONG> in Houston joined our project in 1995, providing user interface design for the ArcView packages and lending long-time energy industry and programming expertise to the product.  (714-662-9167 email: smoravec@eagle.com)

<H3>XVI. GENERAL RATE POLICY</H3><P>

<blockquote>
The publisher reserves the right to insert the word "advertisement" when, in the publisher's opinion, an advertisement resembles editorial material.  Advertisers and agencies assume liability for all content (including text, representation and illustrations) of advertisements, and also assume responsibility for any claim arising therefrom made against the publisher.  The publisher reserves the right to reject any advertising that does not conform to publication standards.  Publisher cannot be held responsible for circumstances beyond his/her control, such as a postal strike, act of God, action by any governmental, or quasi-governmental entity.<P>

Orders are accepted subject to change in rates upon notice from the publisher.  Advertisers will be short-rated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they do not use the amount of space upon which their billings have been based.<P>

Advertisers will be rebated if, within a 12-month period from the date of the first insertion, they have used sufficient space to warrant a higher frequency.  Publisher reserves the right to hold the advertiser and/or its advertising agency jointly and severally liable for such monies as are due and payable to the publisher.<P>

<b>UU203  Information Requirements for the Competitive Utility Environment</b><br> 
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Monday 0830 - 173  $355</b></i><br>
<P>Competition, downsizing and deregulation are words that were unheard of at utilities until the last few years.  Now they are commonplace.  They will also change, forever, the way utilities do business.  Those that don't change successfully will not be doing business at some point in the future.  To compete in a competitive environment, utilities must develop an enterprise-wide information network that connects all areas of the utility from generation to the customer.  This requires a strategic approach that starts with a strategic information technology strategy.  Accurate timely information to support the business objectives of the utility must become a strategic corporate asset.  The seminar will explore development of a strategic information technology strategy competing in a regulated environment, technology as a tool to meet business objectives, how timely information will make the difference, organizational issues and how to proceed from where you are today.  Case studies of the integration of information systems and telecommunication groups into a single department will be reviewed and analyzed.<p>
<P><hr width=25%><P>
<b>UU204  Communications Techniques for Distribution Management Systems</b><br>
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Sunday  0830 - 1730  $355</b></i><br>
<P>For utilities to compete and prosper, they must deliver better services at lower prices to their customers.  The focus for utilities for the foreseeable future will be the distribution system.  Automation of the distribution system offers many business and operational benefits to utilities.  Automation requires communication systems that can evolve to meet future requirements.  Nowhere has technology been changing as rapidly as in communications.  This seminar will investigate: communications issues, communication technologies, standards, system architecture (public/private/hybrid), expansion of communication systems to meet future requirements, and case studies of successful communication systems being deployed by utilities.  The participants will gain an understanding of what communication systems and standards are being implemented and the pros and cons of the different systems.<p>
<P><hr width=25%><P>
<b>UU205  Customer Interface Issues</b><br>
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Sunday 0830-1730  $355</b></i><br>
<p>In today's mature electric utility marketplace, utilities are looking toward cost savings and expense management, rather than growth, to produce new profits.  Utilities must encourage intelligent use of electricity to reduce reliance on costly generation options to respond to peaks and unpredictable demands.  Advances in computer and communications technology make it feasible to offer new services to customers while enabling utilities to reduce costs.  If properly planned and implemented, both the utility and the customer will profit.  This seminar explores automated meter reading, its cost justification and how the resulting two-way communication system can be used to offer additional services to your customers.  It will discuss business and competitive issues, current and future technology, additional customer services and actual case studies.<p>

<b>UU206  Substation Automation - Achieving the Promised LANd</b><br>
Presented by KEMA/ECC<br>
<i><b>1 day Monday 0830 - 1730 $355</b></i><br>
<P>Substation automation, long sought for real time control and protection, and reduced wiring and maintenance costs, is an important link in enterprise wide automation and vital for successful utilities.  Energy management systems (EMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) remotely monitor and control substation activities.  Today's technology, however, offers new capabilities critical for utilities operating in the 21st century.  This seminar explores the role of substation automation in enterprise wide automation.  A case study of the EPRI RP-3599 (Substation Integrated Protection, Control and Data Acquisition) project requirements, and conceptual design, will be presented with demonstrations of the object modeling and communication analysis tools used in the project.  Examples of the state of the art in IED's (Intelligent Electronic Devices), communications and software for substation automation will be discussed, along with actions the utility needs to take to achieve the promised land of substation automation.<P>

<b>UU 215  Integrated Information Management for Water and   Wastewater Utilities</b><br> 
Presented by ESRI  *Free for Water Track registrants<br>
<i><b>1 day  Monday  $355</b></i><br>
The planning, operation and management of municipal utilities can benefit from the use of information management and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Water and wastewater systems are rapidly aging and the public and regulatory agencies are demanding new improved services.  Information management is becoming one of the most important functions needed to manage water/wastewater collection and treatment systems.  The development of an information management system for public utilities will be presented and illustrated with actual examples from the City of Los Angeles Wastewater Collection System Planning GIS and other projects.  This workshop will cover the development of a needs assessment; database design and a listing of key GIS coverages; procedures for data conversion; functions needed for planning, operating, and managing a utility system; and requirements for maintaining the information management system and ensuring data quality.<p>

More delegates named the DA/DSM DistribuTECH Conference as their most important conference and exhibition than any other forum.  Specifically, this event is preferred by exhibitors for the following reasons:  attraction of decision-makers, comprehensive array of current and future information, and focus on advanced technologies.<P>

Now in its seventh year, the DA/DSM DistribuTECH Conference's reputation for excellence, depth and innovation draws influential delegates in ever increasing numbers.  The <STRONG>Solution Exchange<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>TM</FONT></SUP> Expo</STRONG> area, with morning-'til-dusk exhibit hours, fosters a <STRONG>low-key, professional environment for networking and discussion</STRONG> with this audience.  Plus, there are several unique ways for you to interact with this market:  A power breakfast lets you meet specific delegates in small groups; your literature can be distinguished to all attendees at check-in; and exhibiting companies receive free and reduced-fee conference registrations.  It's a must for those responsible for avoiding pitfalls in this dynamic marketplace.<P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=5>C</FONT>ONFERENCE <FONT SIZE=5>P</FONT>ROGRAM</H3>
The conference agenda's focus on leading-edge topics and innovative presentation methods has contributed to the event's powerful reputation for educational value.  This, in turn, results in an unusually strong attendance by key decision-makers and project teams of utilities across the USA.  The people you want to meet!<P>

The DA/DSM DistribuTECH Conference program consists of Vision Forums and Expert Laboratories developed by a 30+ member think-tank of experts.  Each Vision Forum is comprised of three lecturers selected through submissions from the industry-wide Call For Participation.  Submitted proposals outnumber available presentations "slots" by a factor of more than 4 to 1, and the selection procedure for successful authors is a rigorous and well-honed process conducted by our advisory panel.  Expert Labs are informal and their format varies.<P>

<br>Tuesday, October 22 - 2:00 P.M. - 5:30 P.M. </strong>
<br>As utilities enter a de-regulated and more competitive era one of the strategies they will employ to retain existing customers and attract new customers will be to develop energy related services that will focus on the customer side of the meter. This session will review what goes in to developing these services and also explore specific services that are currently being offered by some utilities and their energy services subsidiaries.

"Fiber-Optic Networks - How Utilities Can Participate and Profit in Communications, Control, and Competitive Services."<br>
<b><i>Wednesday, January 29th	0830-1200 BF.1 $295</i></b><br>
<blockquote>Utilities need both a short- and a long-term strategic plan to establish a fiber-optic communications infrastructure in the open-competition marketplace approved by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  This infrastructure promises benefits for utilities and their customers.  Many utilities have installed fiber-optic networks but do not have the expertise to financially optimize their communications advantages.  To achieve that goal, utilities are partnering with network and service providers to enhance their own energy monitoring systems as well as internal and external communications platforms.  More important, these alliances are delivering revenue-earning voice, video, and data services over fiber to homes and businesses.  This Summit will explain how fiber-optic networks can furnish utilities with the basis for:<p>

<LI>	Process control and communications cost reductions.
<LI>	Service packaging and competitive operational advantages.
<LI>	New sources of revenues via diversification.<p></blockquote>

<i>Distribution Automation in Asia and the Far East	Panel</i><br>
The fast economic growth in Asia has fueled rapid expansion of many Asian power utilities. These utilities recognize that the application of advanced technologies in power distribution control is an important part of their infrastructure expansion. Power utilities in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia, among others, have embarked on or have completed major projects in distribution dispatch control systems or distribution automation systems.  Most of these systems have or will have capabilities as sophisticated as those envisioned by U.S. utilities.  The panelists will present their experiences and their views on these systems.  The topics to be covered include Hong Kong Electric's experience with DMS (with 3,000 installed RTUs), China Light & Power's current and future systems for distribution control and their experience with on-line relational database, Singapore Power's experience with an operating DMS and expert-system alarm-processor, and China's efforts in implementing modern control systems.<p>

<i>Energy Service Bureaux - the UK Experience and Their Criticality as a     Value Added Service in    the USA Following Deregulation	Panel</i><br>
Service Bureaux has been a major feature of the utility management scene in the UK since the late 1980's.  These services have primarily been contracted and paid for by end users, principally large organizations with multiple premises.  However, they are now often funded by utilities of suppliers (energy marketers) as Value Added Service to differentiate their product.  A particular benefit is that this service develops and maintains long term customer loyalty.  The Bureaux provides a wide range of outsourced services, fundamentally based around:<p>
<LI>electronic and paper based reporting to various levels of management
<LI>collection of utility data from meters and invoices, both manually and electronically
<LI>validation of metering data to minimize errors in customer billing
<LI>validation of invoices 
<LI>statistical analysis of data to identify consumption and cost saving opportunities
<LI>provision of services to competing utility retailers by a neutral services bureaux.<p>

<b>Wednesday 1030	ELB.4</b><br>
<i>Object Frameworks - Who is on the Bus?	Panel</i><br>
Competitiveness for utilities depends on a close relationship between the business model and the information systems which support the business.  A tight integration of applications and systems is required, along with the flexibility to swap out old technologies, rapidly add new business partners onto the value chain of networked systems, and easily reorganize processes around market changes.  Companies are increasingly switching away from new application development and maintenance to mostly purchased applications with a significantly increased focus on integration.  Few utilities, however, have a time-tested approach for systems integration.  Considerably different skills are required when connecting systems and applications which were not initially designed to work together.  The integration has to span not only the technical domains of the computer systems, but also the corporate business domain.  Frameworks based on object standards can do just that.  New Integration approaches are built around the Object Management Group's (OMG) standard called CORBA, or Common Object Request Broker Architecture.  The panelists will address the current status of the CORBA standard, CORBA integration projects in other vertical industries and the application of object frameworks to integrated distribution management.<p>

Restructuring and retail access will make time-differentiated and real-time rates the industry standard.  However, most utilities and regulators are often uncertain regarding how, when and to whom these rates should be offered first.  Should these rates be available only to large corporate users?  Is there an opportunity to provide real-time pricing in conjunction with bill consolidation initiatives?  Can real-time pricing be offered to residential customers?  This panel will explore these issues and provide information from their own initiatives that examine appropriate communication media, metering technologies, and customer interface devices for supporting these initiatives.<p>

<b>Thursday  0800</b><br>
<i>PS.2  An Industry Town Meeting:  Part One</i><br>
<i>Past / Present / Future of the Energy Marketing Environment</i><br>
The year of the oil embargo - '1973' is often characterized as a seminal event for the power industry.  However, the last five years have been witness to enormous change - the rise and fall of demand-side management, the firm establishment of non-utility generators as alternative energy providers, and most importantly, a customer-led revolution toward competition - perhaps best characterized by the rapid emergence of power marketers.  The next five years will introduce even more significant change.  <p>
How do commercial and industrial customers view their current providers, why and what market changes do they anticipate?  Although regulatory efforts to restructure and deregulate the industry are still being considered, are they too little too late?  Just how far along have the energy markets already progressed toward a real competitive future?  Finally, what will the future look like?  Will communication-based networks obliterate the geographic boundaries of conventional utilities and firmly establish the 'virtual electronic utility'?  These industry experts will provide the answers.<p>
<i>Moderator:	Roger Levy</i><br>
<i>Participants:  Joe Ellis, TQS Research; Fred Pickel, Arthur Andersen National Utility Group; Nancy Day, New Energy Ventures, Inc.; Jim Andrus, ITRON</i><p>
<b>Thursday 1030</b><br>
<i>PS.3  An Industry Town Meeting:  Part Two</i><br>
<i>Utility Restructuring California PUC's Move to Competition (Invited)</i><br>
Although many utilities, consumers, and most of the vendor community are moving rapidly to support a competitive environment, state and federal regulators have not yet resolved the new rules of the game.  The new rules will determine the metering and communication requirements, what data is collected, who gets access, and how public policy related technology development and conservation program issues are resolved.  With over 30 states and the Federal government actively involved in the industry restructuring effort, uncertainty is growing over the potential outcomes.  This moderator led panel of regulators, legislative representatives, and commission staff will examine some of the most critical technology-related issues of restructuring.  Critical attention will be focused on the  new 'rules' from California that will undoubtedly influence other state and federal regulatory proceedings.<p>

<HR SIZE=10>
<p>
 Quality is paramount at Life Plus.<p>

The Life Plus foundation has evolved with over fifty years of experience in manufacturing "doctor quality" leading edge nutritional supplements.<p>
<p>
Our unique product line utilizes only the highest quality materials which are as natural as possible. They are formulated in the most synergistic way to provide optimum nutritional results.<p>
<p>
Because our products are manufactured in-house, we can naturally guarantee potency and quality and provide them at economical, realistic, wholesale prices.<p>
<p>
Our formulas are pH balanced, hypoallergenic, synergistic and contain no artificial additives. We use only natural and naturally derived manufacturing aids. We do not use preservatives, artificial coloring or flavoring or flavoring agents, soy derivatives, corn, salt, or sugar in our formulas.<p>
<p>
Even though our method of cold processing is costly and time consuming, this type of processing is the natural choice since heat destroys the activity of many vitamins, enzymes and phytonutrients.<p>
<p>
The Life Plus nutritional product line is complete, but not complex. Active enzymes, nutritional precursors  and phytonutrients are important components of each unique Life Plus formula.<p>
<p>
Most Life Plus products are formulated in our proprietary PhytoZyme base which contains phytonutrients and proteolytic enzymes. This assures a broad spectrum base of phytochemical trace nutrients for numerous synergistic co-factors and maximum bio-availability and utilization.<p>
