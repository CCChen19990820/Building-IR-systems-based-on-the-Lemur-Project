<A NAME="THREATENED">THREATENED REGIONS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Major portions of four regions will face potentially serious water supply and resource challenges over the next 50 years. These areas include the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Corpus Christi in South Texas; the Houston-Galveston region in Southeast Texas; the San Antonio and Austin areas in South Central Texas; and the El Paso region in Far West Texas.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#62">(62)</A>
<P>
In Southeast and South Central Texas, local governments have joined the Texas Water Development Board and other public entities to examine long-range water resource management strategies. These strategies include inter-basin water transfers, accomplished either through physical transfers or through market transfers of water from areas of surplus to areas of future water deficit. Known as the Trans-Texas Water Program, the study area is divided into three regions which account for about a third of the state's population and include the cities of Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Corpus Christi. Two major alternatives are currently under review: building additional water supplies for Houston and areas to the south, or transferring water or water rights from more inland locations to both Houston and other major demand centers such as Corpus Christi and San Antonio. 
<P>
At present, the Trans-Texas Program is only an assessment and planning program, examining whether the current approach of increasing water supply by building dams and reservoirs is preferable to transferring water from one basin to another. 
<H4>
<A NAME="FUTURE">MEETING FUTURE WATER DEMANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas currently spends about $1 billion a year of private, local, state and federal funds on new water treatment, sewage and drainage facilities.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#63">(63)</A> Meeting future demand for water will require billions of dollars in federal, local and state funding for new water supply projects as well as for expansions of treatment, sewage and draining facilities. 
<P>
Over the next 50 years, the Board estimates Texas will need $41 billion in funds for wastewater and water systems, reservoirs, conveyance, pipelines and flood control. An additional $700 million will be needed to provide these basic services to Texas residents living in colonias, unincorporated areas along the border that lack proper water and wastewater treatment.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#64">(64)</A>
<P>
From 1978 to 1989, the federal portion of total state spending on water-related facilities declined from 40 percent to 17 percent.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#65">(65)</A> As the federal government continues to cut back its funding for state water projects, Texans will increasingly bear these financing costs themselves. And these costs are climbing as more stringent environmental regulations take effect. These rising costs are particularly burdensome for small and rural systems. In 1985, there were 2,646 wastewater discharge permits from municipal sewage treatment plants. By 1994, that total had been reduced to 2,354 as many smaller systems began to consolidate with larger city systems.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#66">(66)</A> 
<P>
The effort to assure an adequate supply to meet future demand can involve varying water development strategies. These strategies can be divided roughly into two categories: supply-side alternatives, which rely on increasing the water supply, and demand-side alternatives, which focus on reducing demand. Supply-side alternatives include new reservoirs, expanded water reuse and inter-basin transfers. Demand-side strategies include drought management, water transfers from one category of use to another - such as irrigation to municipal - and conservation. 
<P>
In the past, new reservoirs and other water supply projects were built to meet expected water needs. In 1913, Texas had only eight major reservoirs, with a capacity of about 359,000 acre-feet, the largest of which was Lake Medina. By 1930, that figure had risen to 32, with more than a million acre-feet of capacity. The damming of rivers and creation of new reservoirs continued, and by 1980 there were 168 major reservoirs.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#67">(67)</A> Today, there are 191 major reservoirs, covering nearly 1.7 million acres, providing 37 million acre-feet of capacity and 11 million acre-feet of sustainable yield.
<P>
Past state water plans favored supply-side solutions. The 1969 Texas Water Plan advocated importing water from the Mississippi River to Northeast Texas and moving the water through a series of canals and aqueducts to the Rio Grande Valley and West Texas. Texas voters rejected an amendment to provide initial funding for the project, which would have required 67 dams. A similar plan to import water and build 27 new reservoirs was also voted down in 1974.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#69">(69)</A> In 1981, Texas Speaker of the House Billy Clayton proposed a state Water Trust Fund, which would have set aside one-half of the state's budget surplus for future water projects. "Proposition Four" was defeated by voters. The 1984 Water Plan also called for the construction of 44 new reservoirs, although the Texas Water Development Board sought no bonding authority from the legislature and Texas voters for these water projects.
<P>
While the Texas Water Development Board continues to recommend construction of new reservoirs to meet long-term water needs, other supply and demand options are also being considered. The 1990 Water Plan calls for phased-in conservation methods to reduce demand by 3.5 million acre-feet as well as the development of 14 new surface water reservoirs, five salinity control projects, 29 major water conveyance piping systems and a tripling of water reuse and use of return flows to provide supplies. Both the 1984 and 1990 Water Plans also included specific recommendations relating to agricultural, municipal and industrial water conservation.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#70">(70)</A>
<P>
The proposal to build more reservoirs is controversial. Opponents claim it is both environmentally destructive and not the most efficient way to meet demand. They argue, for example, that the construction of reservoirs harms animal habitat and destroys wetlands by reducing the amount of inundated lands.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#71">(71)</A> This construction also penalizes downstream users because run-of-the-river flows are reduced, impacting water use. Also, wastewater discharges must meet more stringent permit standards when there is less water to dilute the discharge. While proponents recognize the need to mitigate environmental damage, they believe that some reservoirs are needed to meet the demands of a growing population. Both sides agree, however, that other "non-traditional" water development strategies are needed, given the scarcity of resources and increasing regulations to protect the environment. In essence, water resource planners are calling for a shift from water development to water management.

<TR><TH>DO WE REALLY NEED MORE RESERVOIRS?</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Do we really need more reservoirs? A look at the decision-making process for two proposed reservoirs in Northeast Texas shows that the answer to this question depends on the assumptions about demand and relative priority a community gives to meeting that demand with newly developed supplies. 
<P>
Little Cypress Reservoir, proposed in the 1984 and 1990 Texas Water Plans, was intended to augment existing water supplies for the cities of Kilgore, Marshall, Shreveport, Louisiana and, mainly, Longview. Another project, Waters Bluff Reservoir, supported by the Sabine River Authority, was intended to meet future demands in the Upper Sabine Basin. Both proposals met fierce opposition from local and state environmental groups.
<P>
The Water Bluffs Reservoir was controversial because in 1986 the Little Sandy Hunting and Fishing Club donated more than 3,800 acres of bottomland hardwood forest to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the form of a Conservation Easement. Construction of the Waters Bluff Reservoir would flood 40,000 acres of Sabine River bottomlands, including the Little Sandy easement.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#68">(68)</A> However, a Federal District Court in Texarkana upheld the Little Sandy environmental easement, and an appeal of the decision also failed, preventing development of the Water Bluffs Reservoir. 
<P>
About 15 miles upstream of Caddo Lake - Texas' only natural lake - the proposed Little Cypress Reservoir would flood approximately 14,000 acres 
of prime bottomland hardwood forest and agricultural land. The reservoir would also affect habitats downstream by changing the flow of Little Cypress Creek and ultimately, Caddo Lake. The reservoir was supported by both the Little Cypress Utility District and the Texas Water Development Board, since it would provide a sustainable yield of 129,000 acre-feet of water to cities in the area. However, voters in parts of Gregg and Harrison Counties rejected a major increase in their property taxes to help pay for the proposed reservoir, which has estimated capital costs of $300 million. 
<P>
While the 1990 Water Plan and 1992 update to the plan both make a case for further development in the area, local environmental groups like the Little Sandy Fishing and Hunting Club argued that Texas Water Development Board projections overemphasized future demands and ignored other available supply options, such as additional water from the Sabine River. Some of the cities that had initially planned to participate in the Little Cypress Reservoir development, like Kilgore, have since purchased water from the Sabine River Authority to meet future needs.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#72">(72)</A> Also, actual water use in Gregg and Harrison counties totalled 122,000 acre-feet in 1990, far below previous Texas Water Development Board projections.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#73">(73)</A> In February, 1993, the Little Cypress Utility District withdrew its application for a permit to construct a reservoir.

<A NAME="ALTERNATIVE"><H4>ALTERNATIVE WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES</A></H4>
What are the alternatives to traditional supply-side water development projects like reservoirs and conveyance systems?<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#74">(74)</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="DEMAND">Demand-based Strategies</A></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Water conservation. Conserving water by consuming less, wasting less or reusing some water helps reduce current costs, preserves future supplies and postpones or eliminates the need for expensive new developments. A modest conservation program that reduces municipal water demand by 15 percent would save $25 billion over the next 50 years.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#75">(75)</A>
<P>
<LI>Waste prevention. By state law, when water is not applied to a specific beneficial use, it is a violation of the right to use the water. Waste is not a beneficial use. Assuring that faulty sprinkler heads, broken or leaky pipes or the over-application of irrigation water does not result in waste could be a part of the state's permitting process, or alternatively, could be encouraged through various incentives.
<P>
<LI>Cancellation of water rights. Water rights that are not being used or not being used in a "beneficial" way can be cancelled by the state and set aside for environmental use or for future demand. For example, a city which had set aside large amounts of water based upon future growth might have that right cancelled based upon its "wasteful" non-use of water. It is difficult to estimate how much water is available through the cancellation of water rights, since it has never been done in Texas. Inevitably, cancellation would likely be a time-consuming and costly process, involving extensive legal action. 
<P>
<li>Water Transactions and Banking. Water rights can be traded, sold or leased in Texas, though the state imposes limits on the free transfer and marketing of these rights. Water transactions have occurred in several recent water right amendment hearings before the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. In 1993, the Legislature charged the Texas Water Development Board with creating a "Water Bank" to facilitate the transfer of water between water right holders. Water right holders may "deposit" water rights into the Bank. The Texas Water Development Board can then help negotiate prices between the purchaser and depositor; maintain a clearinghouse of depositors and those needing supplies; encourage water right holders to implement water conservation practices by depositing the conserved water in the bank; and sell, buy and hold water rights itself. The Texas Water Development Board is currently developing rules to implement the Water Bank. Although the Texas Water Development Board must coordinate with both the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and Texas Parks and Wildlife, concerns have been raised about how impacts to the environment would be addressed by the bank and about the possible speculation by private entities who do not actually use the rights.
</UL> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="NON-TRADITIONAL">Non-traditional Supply Strategies</A></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Conjunctive Use of Groundwater and Surface Water. One conjunctive use alternative involves injecting excess surface water into an aquifer for storage and subsequently withdrawing it during times of insufficient surface flows. The city of El Paso is currently injecting up to 10,000 acre-feet of highly treated effluent per year into the Hueco Bolson Aquifer for use in times of drought. The recharging of water prevents loss through evaporation and also avoids the environmental impacts associated with the construction of surface reservoirs. However, in some situations, it may not be desirable because it reduces wastewater return flows to rivers or streams.
<P>
<LI>Interbasin Transfer. Water rights may be transferred from one river basin to another, to help areas with high demand meet their supply needs.
<P>
<li>Desalination. Desalination is the treatment of seawater or brackish groundwater by desalting the water and making it into fresh water. In 1992, there were 89 desalting plants in Texas, mainly for industrial use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#76">(76)</A> Desalting of saltwater is one recommended solution to meet the needs of coastal cities like Corpus Christi, while cities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley are considering desalting saline groundwater for industrial and municipal uses.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 2, Water 
Quality, Page 1
</H5>
<H4>
<A NAME="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The competing demands made on water have affected not only its supply and future availability, but also its quality. In some watersheds, diversion and damming of rivers has reduced streamflow, which has concentrated pollutants in a smaller volume of water and thereby degraded overall surface water quality. Some Texas rivers are prevented from drying up entirely only by the return flow of wastewater, which, even when optimally treated, is of lower quality than the river's original water. 
<P>
Groundwater quality has likewise suffered the effects of high demand. Continual mining of aquifers has lowered the quality of groundwater by drawing up the salt water that lies deep in most aquifers into the formations from which water for human consumption is drawn. 
<P>
Mitigating the effects of high demand on both surface water and groundwater quality will require a long-term commitment to conservation and limits on development. Representing a more acute risk to water quality, though, is contamination that results from such human activities as industry, agriculture and urban life. Water moves in a continuous hydrological cycle from earth to atmosphere and back. This means that all bodies of water - rivers, lakes, oceans and aquifers - are essentially connected to each other, allowing for many sources of contamination. 
<P>
In Texas, human activity has affected water quality in all 15 river basins, in the eight coastal basins where rivers drain into the Gulf of Mexico and in all major aquifers, including some that are sources of drinking water. This section examines four aspects of water quality:

<A NAME="HISTORY">HISTORY</A> OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION
</H4>
<P>
For more than 100 years, the federal government has been passing laws to provide funding and oversight for the development of dams, reservoirs and canals. Not until the 1940s and 1950s, however, did Congress begin to address water pollution legislatively. And initial efforts in this area, like the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, did not address pollution prevention plans or the development of water quality standards. Instead they focused on funding water treatment plants, identifying polluted bodies of water and locating the polluters for legal action. Unfortunately, the strategy of determining which polluter caused which pollution was expensive and often unsuccessful.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<P>
Comprehensive legislation to protect water quality didn't take off until the 1960s. Rachel Carson's 1962 bestseller, <B>Silent Spring</B>, bolstered by articles and scientific reports detailing pollution problems, provided the impetus for the nation's first water quality legislation.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#2">(2)</A> During the early 1960s, the National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League and the National Audubon Society campaigned for strong federal water-quality bills. 
<P>
One result was the 1965 Water Quality Act, which established within the Department of Interior the Water Pollution Control Administration. With the creation of this new federal agency, water quality was for the first time treated as an environmental concern, apart from the more traditional public health concern. The new agency also had precedence over states in setting water quality standards. The 1965 law was soon followed by the 1966 Clean Waters Act, which provided construction grants for wastewater treatment facilities. 
<P>
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, administered by the Department of the Interior, attempted to preserve waters with outstanding scenic, recreational or habitat value by placing them on a Secretary of Interior-approved list. To a limited degree, the law protects these listed "wild and scenic rivers" from water projects and from additional discharges. It prohibits the development of public or private hydroelectric power plants on these rivers and restrains certain other types of development. In Texas, only the Rio Grande has been designated as a wild and scenic river, and this designation has not protected the river from degradation. In fact, in 1993, American Rivers, a non-profit watchdog organization, named the Rio Grande the most endangered river in the U.S.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#3">(3)</A>
 
<P>
The Clean Water Act of 1972 forms the basis today for water quality protection for surface water in streams, rivers and lakes as well as for groundwater. It was enacted as a series of amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, a law spurred by public concern over epidemics of disease caused by water-borne bacteria. The 1972 Act was prompted by the worsening condition of U.S. rivers and by several high-profile oil spills, including the Santa Barbara channel spill, in which 250 million gallons of crude oil escaped to damage miles of California coastline.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#4">(4)</A>
 
<P>
The Clean Water Act required both municipal and industrial polluters to employ approved technologies in their operations. It also set water quality standards for major rivers and lakes and required discharge permits for both public and private facilities. The Act was strengthened in 1977 in an effort to address the most visible causes of water pollution. It explicitly prohibited the discharge of hazardous substances into waterways , including industrial waste, sewage, accidental spills, toxics and other point sources. The Clean Water Act of 1977 also further protected wetlands by requiring U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue permits for all dredging and filling projects. These permits are called <BR>
"404" permits.
<P>
Between 1972, when the first Clean Water Act was passed, and 1990, about $260 billion in private and public funds were spent on wastewater treatment facilities. Another $20 billion was spent to comply with federal requirements on drinking water quality, most of it from the public sector.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#5">(5)</A>

<P>
The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act were the first concerted effort by the federal government to address pollution from non-point sources, including agricultural fields and feedlots, urban streets and run-off channeled through municipal stormwater systems. The law required states to develop a non-point-source management plan. As of 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency had approved these plans for 44 states, including Texas. <A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#6">(6)</A> While the goal of these plans is to alleviate non-point-source pollution, states are not required to go beyond voluntary programs. The management plans develop abatement strategies for water degraded by non-point sources, but implementation of the plans is strictly voluntary. The 1987 Act also created and funded several special programs, including one to deal with toxic hot spots and one to protect estuaries. 
<P>
In 1995, the U.S. Congress debated making major changes in the scope of the Clean Water Act, giving industries and cities much greater 
flexibility in meeting clean water standards. Texas and national environmental groups opposed these changes.
<P>
Early in the twentieth century, contamination of the water supply and outbreaks of disease led to questions about how we purify our water and how we protect our drinking water supplies from pollution. The Public Health Service Act of 1912 set guidelines for allowable levels of contaminants related to communicable diseases like typhoid. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 created national drinking water standards to limit a range of substances that can adversely affect human health. These maximum-contaminant levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency are based upon the health effects of a single contaminant. They do not consider the cumulative impact of a combination of contaminants on human health, because little is known about possible synergistic effects. Thus, the protective value of these standards may fall short of what is optimum for human health.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#11">(11)</A>
 
<P>
The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act accelerated the EPA's schedule for bringing contaminants under regulation and expanded the number of contaminants covered. It also banned all future use of lead pipes and lead solder in public drinking water systems, increased fines and enforcement and mandated greater protection of drinking water obtained from groundwater through the establishment of a well-head protection program.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#12">(12)</A>

<P>
Though these laws have enhanced the safety of the public water supply, they have been a major expense for public water systems, especially systems serving smaller populations. In 1993, for example, at the direction of the 1986 Drinking Water Act, EPA increased from six to 18 the number of regulated pesticides. EPA estimated that it would cost $24 billion per year for 200,000 systems across the country to monitor the regulated contaminants. Monitoring for 30 to 35 as-yet-unregulated contaminants in anticipation of future regulations would cost these public water systems an additional $89 billion.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#13">(13)</A>
 
<P>
Other federal environmental laws related to water quality include: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 - Required an Environmental Impact Statement for federally-funded projects. 
	<P>
	<LI>Endangered Species Act of 1973 and 1988 - Protects animal and plant species, including those living in aquatic environments, that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated as threatened or endangered.
	<P>
	<LI>Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act of 1984 - Regulated management of solid waste and underground storage tanks, both of which may leak into groundwater. 
	<P>
	<LI>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 - Created a $1.6 billion Superfund to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites, including those contaminating groundwater, and required major industries to report annual releases of toxic waste onto the air, water or land.
	<P>
	<LI>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972 - Required registration and regulation of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals which can contaminate both surface water and groundwater.

<tr><th>TESTING WATER WITH OUR HEADS IN THE SAND?
</th><tr><td>
In 1992 and again in 1994, the river authorities for all 15 inland rivers and eight coastal basins where the rivers flow into the Gulf of Mexico identified the lack of water-quality monitoring as the single biggest pollution issue facing their river basins.<A HREF="notes2.html#7">(7)</A> 
In 1994, under the administration of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and as required by the federal Clean Water Act, the state tested water quality at 695 sites in 1,700 different samples. This level of monitoring represents an increase over the 1991 to 1993 period, but is substantially less than during the 1980s, when most sites were sampled at least quarterly, rather than annually.<A HREF="notes2.html#8">(8)</A> However, these sites included only about one in three of the miles of continually flowing, or "perennial," streams and rivers. Thus, almost nothing is known about the quality of 25,000 out of 40,000 miles of the state's permanent rivers and streams. Also unexamined is the water quality in some 145,000 miles of "intermittent" streams, which flow only during periods of high rainfall.
<p>
In 1994, the Commission monitored water quality in only 114 of an estimated 5,700 lakes and reservoirs.<A HREF="notes2.html#9">(9)</A> Though these reservoirs contain more than 50 percent of total acres in the state's lakes and reservoirs, the sampling protocol nevertheless leaves almost 5,600 smaller bodies of water virtually unmonitored, including 90 reservoirs with more than 5,000 acre-feet of water.<A HREF="notes2.html#10">(10)</A> And where the state does monitor water quality, little testing is done to detect the presence of toxic chemicals or to evaluate the overall state of aquatic life. 
<p>
Instead, the Commission concentrates its limited resources for monitoring on physiochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen content, pH, streamflow, temperature, fecal coliform levels, total dissolved solids, sulfate and chloride. Heavy metals and organics, including some toxics, are also tested in the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's laboratory.<A HREF="notes2.html#14">(14)</A> 
<p>
Even less information is available on the quality of groundwater because the state has no systematic monitoring program for its aquifers. Limited monitoring is done around certain potential contamination sources, such as hazardous waste sites and uranium mines. Otherwise, periodic studies of water wells by the Texas Water Development Board, the Texas Department of Agriculture and some local groundwater conservation districts are the only source of information on groundwater quality. And the Texas Water Development Board is only able to inventory about 10 percent of the nearly 12,000 water wells drilled each year to assign them a state well number and put them on a topographic map. Since this inventory forms the basis for monitoring water quality and for assuring that abandoned wells are properly plugged, gaps in information are significant. In fact, in the absence of state oversight, local and regional governments have been assigning these wells their own numbers.<A HREF="notes2.html#15">(15)</A>

<H3><A NAME="SURFACE">SURFACE WATER: RIVERS, LAKES AND RESERVOIRS</A></H3>
<H4>
<A NAME="REGULATION">SURFACE WATER REGULATION TODAY</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has approximately 191,228 miles of streams and rivers, of which 40,194 miles (21%) are considered perennial, meaning they have a sustained flow throughout the year. In addition, Texas has nearly 8 million square acres of wetlands, more than 3 million square acres of reservoirs, and 1,990.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#7">(7)</A> square miles of bays and 3,879 square miles of open Gulf water along its 624 miles of coast. All of these waters are afforded at least minimal amounts of protection by the state and federal governments.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#17">(17)</A>
<P>
There are three different types of water quality standards set by state and federal regulations. <BR>
These are:
<P>
<B><OL><LI>Stream standards, also referred to as surface water quality standards;
<P><LI>Effluent standards (set for wastewaters);
<P><LI>Drinking water standards, which also covers groundwater used as a public water supply.
</OL></B>
<P>
Today, in Texas, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is the primary agency responsible for water quality management in the state, although it shares the responsibility with the five other state agencies. Under the Clean Water Act and Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has the sole authority to develop and amend surface water quality standards for the state which are implemented via agency permitting programs.
<P>
Texas does not apply a single set of water quality standards to all surface waters in the state. Instead, waters are "classified" according to how they are used, and water quality standards appropriate to that use are applied. Some examples of use classifications are "contact recreation" (swimming), "non-contact recreation" (boating) and "public water supply" (drinking water). In monitoring these river and stream segments, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission seeks to determine whether the water quality is adequate for the segment's classified use. Water quality must be higher for drinking water, for example, than it is for boating.
<P>
Water quality is protected by regulating certain activities; primarily, the discharge of wastewater from cities and industrial operations is prohibited unless a permit is received from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and in most cases the Environmental Protection Agency. These wastewater permits regulate the quality of wastewater that will be discharged into a stream, river, lake or bay. 
<P>
There are three types of wastewater permits issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission :
<P>
<B><OL><LI>Municipal;
<P><LI>Industrial;
<P><LI>Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) such as feedlots, dairies and poultry operations.
</OL><P></B>
Permits either allow wastewater discharge into a stream, river, lake or bay or they are "no discharge" permits. No discharge permits refer to the disposal of wastewater by irrigation or evaporation. For example, all Confined Animal Feeding Operations of a certain size must obtain "no discharge" permits. Permits normally expire after five years at which time they must be renewed. 
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas issues wastewater discharge permits related to oil and gas activities.

<TR><TH>
TEXAS SURFACE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS</TH></TR><TR><TD>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to develop and enforce a comprehensive set of water quality standards. There are two components to surface water quality standards: 
<UL>(1) designated uses and<BR> 
(2) chemical, physical and biological criteria to protect those uses. 
</UL><P>
The uses which may be established for a water body are:
<UL><OL><LI>Protection of aquatic life and habitat so that the water is fishable;
<P><LI>Use for recreation such as swimming;
<P><LI>Use as a drinking water supply;
<P><LI>Use for navigation; and
<P><LI>Use for industrial water supply.</OL></UL><P>
A water body may be assigned more than one of these uses. 
<P>
Upper and lower limits for common water quality criteria are established for each water body. Some of these criteria, or standards, are:
<P>
<UL><OL><LI>Dissolved oxygen;
<P><LI>Temperature;
<P><LI>pH;
<P><LI>Total dissolved solids; 
<P><LI>Fecal coliform bacteria; and
<P><LI>Toxic limits.
</OL></UL><P>
Not all waters in Texas are protected by site-specific criteria. For example, in Texas, only 14,359 of 40,194 perennial river miles (36 percent) and 1.5 million of 3.0 million acres of reservoirs (50 percent) have been designated for a particular use. All 1,990 square miles of bays and 3,879 square miles of ocean waters have been classified.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#19">(19)</A> 
<P>
Classified waters include most rivers and their major tributaries, major reservoirs and estuarine waters. Unclassified waters are those smaller water bodies which have not had a site-specific study analysis performed in order to set site-specific standards. Unclassified waters are protected by general aquatic life standards which apply to all surface waters in the state. 
<P>
The EPA is required to review state water quality standards to ensure they meet the Clean Water Act goals of "fishable and swimmable quality waters."<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#20">(20)</A> States are required to evaluate and if necessary, revise their water quality standards every three years. While most bodies of water are designated a use to meet these broad goals of swim-ming (contact recreation) or fishing (high or exceptional aquatic life), the Houston Ship Channel and Buffalo Bayou are so polluted that they are designated for navigation purposes only. 
<P>
When the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers applications for wastewater discharge permits, it uses these water quality standards to develop limits on the amount and type of contaminants that will be allowed in the discharge.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="DISCHARGE">STATE DISCHARGE PERMITS</A>
</H4>
<P>
As of July 1994, 2,354 municipal wastewater treatment facilities, both publicly and privately owned, were operating with state wastewater discharge permits. Fifty-five water treatment plants, which discharge water during the filtering process, also had state permits. Municipal facilities discharged nearly 3 billion gallons of wastewater per day into Texas surface waters during 1991. In addition to these domestic treatment facilities, there were 1,026 industrial facilities with active state permits in July 1994, which together discharged almost 18 billion gallons per day.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  The combined municipal and industrial discharge of wastewater - about 21 billion gallons per day - is enough to fill Texas Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, 27 times over with wastewater every day. (There are 0.133 cubic feet in a gallon of water; Texas Stadium is 792 feet long, 633 feet wide and 208 feet tall, or approximately 104.2 million cubic feet; about 2.78 billion cubic feet of wastewater is discharged every day.)</UL>
<P>
About 15 percent of both industrial and domestic wastewater permits are no-discharge permits, which means that wastewater is evaporated or used for irrigation instead of being discharged into a river or stream. Finally, in 1994, there were 515 Confined Animal Feeding Operations - feedlots, poultry and dairy operations - which were required to obtain no discharge permits from the TNRCC. 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  Wastewater is mostly water (99.9%). Various kinds of solids make up only 0.1% of sewage. Solids include organic and inorganic materials from feces, urine, washing, laundering, and in some cases, from food processing, agricultural and industrial operations. It is this tiny amount of solids which can contaminate receiving waters. <P><I>Source: Texas Engineering and Extension Service, Texas A &amp; M University System, </I>Basic Wastewater Operation<I>, (College Station: Texas Engineering Extention Service, 1994), 5-1. </I></UL> <P> <UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF" >  Wastewater flows from domestic sources average about 100 gallons per day for each person served. During dry weather, however, highest flows are about twice the average flow while minimum flows are only about half the average flow. <P><I>Source:Texas Engineering and Extension Service, Texas A &amp; M University System, </I>Basic Wastewater Operation<I>, (College Station: Texas Engineering Extention Service, 1994), 4-3.</I></UL> <P> <UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  Each day, the average person contributes approximately 0.2 lbs. per day of total suspended solids - the solids that become sludge in the wastewater treatment process. Thus, in a city of one million, about 200,000 lbs. of suspended solids are turned into sludge at the city's domestic wastewater plant each day.</UL>

<P>Since 1972, the amount of pollution discharged in wastewater by domestic facilities has decreased about 70 percent in Texas. At the same time the amount of waste requiring treatment has increased by 85 percent.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#21">(21)</A> This improvement is due mainly to better technology and to requirements that wastewater in Texas be cleaned up to stricter standards. About 67 percent of domestic wastewater produced by municipal facilities receives advanced treatment.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#22">(22)</A>
<P>
Most discharges in Texas are concentrated near major population centers like Dallas and Houston. The state processes about 200 new or revised industrial permits and about 500 new or revised municipal permits each year. Since 1980, combined industrial and municipal permits have increased from 2,907 to 3,435. While industrial permits have been increasing due to increased economic activity, the number of permitted municipal facilities has actually declined in recent years as some city systems have regionalized their wastewater treatment.

<H3><A NAME="SURFACE">SURFACE WATER: RIVERS, LAKES AND RESERVOIRS</A></H3>
<H4>
<A NAME="REGULATION">SURFACE WATER REGULATION TODAY</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has approximately 191,228 miles of streams and rivers, of which 40,194 miles (21%) are considered perennial, meaning they have a sustained flow throughout the year. In addition, Texas has nearly 8 million square acres of wetlands, more than 3 million square acres of reservoirs, and 1,990.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#7">(7)</A> square miles of bays and 3,879 square miles of open Gulf water along its 624 miles of coast. All of these waters are afforded at least minimal amounts of protection by the state and federal governments.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#17">(17)</A>
<P>
There are three different types of water quality standards set by state and federal regulations. <BR>
These are:
<P>
<B><OL><LI>Stream standards, also referred to as surface water quality standards;
<P><LI>Effluent standards (set for wastewaters);
<P><LI>Drinking water standards, which also covers groundwater used as a public water supply.
</OL></B>
<P>
Today, in Texas, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is the primary agency responsible for water quality management in the state, although it shares the responsibility with the five other state agencies. Under the Clean Water Act and Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has the sole authority to develop and amend surface water quality standards for the state which are implemented via agency permitting programs.
<P>
Texas does not apply a single set of water quality standards to all surface waters in the state. Instead, waters are "classified" according to how they are used, and water quality standards appropriate to that use are applied. Some examples of use classifications are "contact recreation" (swimming), "non-contact recreation" (boating) and "public water supply" (drinking water). In monitoring these river and stream segments, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission seeks to determine whether the water quality is adequate for the segment's classified use. Water quality must be higher for drinking water, for example, than it is for boating.
<P>
Water quality is protected by regulating certain activities; primarily, the discharge of wastewater from cities and industrial operations is prohibited unless a permit is received from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and in most cases the Environmental Protection Agency. These wastewater permits regulate the quality of wastewater that will be discharged into a stream, river, lake or bay. 
<P>
There are three types of wastewater permits issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission :
<P>
<B><OL><LI>Municipal;
<P><LI>Industrial;
<P><LI>Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) such as feedlots, dairies and poultry operations.
</OL><P></B>
Permits either allow wastewater discharge into a stream, river, lake or bay or they are "no discharge" permits. No discharge permits refer to the disposal of wastewater by irrigation or evaporation. For example, all Confined Animal Feeding Operations of a certain size must obtain "no discharge" permits. Permits normally expire after five years at which time they must be renewed. 
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas issues wastewater discharge permits related to oil and gas activities.

<TR><TH>
TEXAS SURFACE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS</TH></TR><TR><TD>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to develop and enforce a comprehensive set of water quality standards. There are two components to surface water quality standards: 
<UL>(1) designated uses and<BR> 
(2) chemical, physical and biological criteria to protect those uses. 
</UL><P>
The uses which may be established for a water body are:
<UL><OL><LI>Protection of aquatic life and habitat so that the water is fishable;
<P><LI>Use for recreation such as swimming;
<P><LI>Use as a drinking water supply;
<P><LI>Use for navigation; and
<P><LI>Use for industrial water supply.</OL></UL><P>
A water body may be assigned more than one of these uses. 
<P>
Upper and lower limits for common water quality criteria are established for each water body. Some of these criteria, or standards, are:
<P>
<UL><OL><LI>Dissolved oxygen;
<P><LI>Temperature;
<P><LI>pH;
<P><LI>Total dissolved solids; 
<P><LI>Fecal coliform bacteria; and
<P><LI>Toxic limits.
</OL></UL><P>
Not all waters in Texas are protected by site-specific criteria. For example, in Texas, only 14,359 of 40,194 perennial river miles (36 percent) and 1.5 million of 3.0 million acres of reservoirs (50 percent) have been designated for a particular use. All 1,990 square miles of bays and 3,879 square miles of ocean waters have been classified.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#19">(19)</A> 
<P>
Classified waters include most rivers and their major tributaries, major reservoirs and estuarine waters. Unclassified waters are those smaller water bodies which have not had a site-specific study analysis performed in order to set site-specific standards. Unclassified waters are protected by general aquatic life standards which apply to all surface waters in the state. 
<P>
The EPA is required to review state water quality standards to ensure they meet the Clean Water Act goals of "fishable and swimmable quality waters."<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#20">(20)</A> States are required to evaluate and if necessary, revise their water quality standards every three years. While most bodies of water are designated a use to meet these broad goals of swim-ming (contact recreation) or fishing (high or exceptional aquatic life), the Houston Ship Channel and Buffalo Bayou are so polluted that they are designated for navigation purposes only. 
<P>
When the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers applications for wastewater discharge permits, it uses these water quality standards to develop limits on the amount and type of contaminants that will be allowed in the discharge.

<H4><A NAME="DISCHARGE">STATE DISCHARGE PERMITS</A>
</H4>
<P>
As of July 1994, 2,354 municipal wastewater treatment facilities, both publicly and privately owned, were operating with state wastewater discharge permits. Fifty-five water treatment plants, which discharge water during the filtering process, also had state permits. Municipal facilities discharged nearly 3 billion gallons of wastewater per day into Texas surface waters during 1991. In addition to these domestic treatment facilities, there were 1,026 industrial facilities with active state permits in July 1994, which together discharged almost 18 billion gallons per day.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  The combined municipal and industrial discharge of wastewater - about 21 billion gallons per day - is enough to fill Texas Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, 27 times over with wastewater every day. (There are 0.133 cubic feet in a gallon of water; Texas Stadium is 792 feet long, 633 feet wide and 208 feet tall, or approximately 104.2 million cubic feet; about 2.78 billion cubic feet of wastewater is discharged every day.)</UL>
<P>
About 15 percent of both industrial and domestic wastewater permits are no-discharge permits, which means that wastewater is evaporated or used for irrigation instead of being discharged into a river or stream. Finally, in 1994, there were 515 Confined Animal Feeding Operations - feedlots, poultry and dairy operations - which were required to obtain no discharge permits from the TNRCC. 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  Wastewater is mostly water (99.9%). Various kinds of solids make up only 0.1% of sewage. Solids include organic and inorganic materials from feces, urine, washing, laundering, and in some cases, from food processing, agricultural and industrial operations. It is this tiny amount of solids which can contaminate receiving waters. <P><I>Source: Texas Engineering and Extension Service, Texas A &amp; M University System, </I>Basic Wastewater Operation<I>, (College Station: Texas Engineering Extention Service, 1994), 5-1. </I></UL> <P> <UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF" >  Wastewater flows from domestic sources average about 100 gallons per day for each person served. During dry weather, however, highest flows are about twice the average flow while minimum flows are only about half the average flow. <P><I>Source:Texas Engineering and Extension Service, Texas A &amp; M University System, </I>Basic Wastewater Operation<I>, (College Station: Texas Engineering Extention Service, 1994), 4-3.</I></UL> <P> <UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  Each day, the average person contributes approximately 0.2 lbs. per day of total suspended solids - the solids that become sludge in the wastewater treatment process. Thus, in a city of one million, about 200,000 lbs. of suspended solids are turned into sludge at the city's domestic wastewater plant each day.</UL>

<P>Since 1972, the amount of pollution discharged in wastewater by domestic facilities has decreased about 70 percent in Texas. At the same time the amount of waste requiring treatment has increased by 85 percent.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#21">(21)</A> This improvement is due mainly to better technology and to requirements that wastewater in Texas be cleaned up to stricter standards. About 67 percent of domestic wastewater produced by municipal facilities receives advanced treatment.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#22">(22)</A>
<P>
Most discharges in Texas are concentrated near major population centers like Dallas and Houston. The state processes about 200 new or revised industrial permits and about 500 new or revised municipal permits each year. Since 1980, combined industrial and municipal permits have increased from 2,907 to 3,435. While industrial permits have been increasing due to increased economic activity, the number of permitted municipal facilities has actually declined in recent years as some city systems have regionalized their wastewater treatment.

<H4>
<A NAME="EXTENT">EXTENT</A> OF SURFACE WATER POLLUTION
</H4>
<P>
Pollution has to some degree impacted all of Texas' 15 inland river basins and eight coastal basins, several of its reservoirs and all of its estuaries, coastal wetlands and bays.23 According to the 1994 Texas Natrual Resource Conservation Commission's Water Quality Inventory, only 9, 495 miles, or 66 percent of the number of river miles with specific state standards, fully supported the uses for which they were designated by the state.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#24">(24)</A> Some 2,200 miles (15 percent) only partially supported their uses, while 18 percent, or 2, 664 miles did not support their uses at all (see discussion of Water Quality Standards).<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#25">(25)</A>
 <P>
Of the 4, 864 miles which didn't fully meet their designated use in 1994, 3,983 miles did not meet safe swimming conditions, 1,545 miles did not meet standards for aquatic life, and three miles could not fully support boating and non-contact recreation uses. In addition, 256 miles were determined by the Texas Department of Health and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to be too contaminated to safely consume the fish. 
<P>
Only 3 percent of the reservoirs did not meet their use classifications: 2 percent did not meet high aquatic life standards (27,188 square acres) and the remaining 1 percent failed to meet the criteria for swimming and other forms of contact recreation (6,355 square acres).<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#26">(26)</A> It is worth noting that while all reservoirs used as public water supplies did fully support this use, some reservoirs did not meet secondary drinking water standards for chloride, sulfate and total dissolved solids, requiring expensive treatment processes to support this use.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#27">(27)</A> Some 500 square acres of reservoirs were also too contaminated to safely eat the fish.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
In the streams and rivers, the most frequently violated water quality standards were those for pathogens (high levels of fecal coliform bacteria), low dissolved oxygen and, in some areas, toxics such as metals and pesticides. Excess plant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) were also identified as a problem in some waters of the state. In reservoirs, violations were related to low levels of dissolved oxygen, high levels of pathogens and pesticides.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#31">(31)</A>
<P>
According to the 1994 Water Quality Inventory and data drawn from the state's limited monitoring of toxics, 52 segments of Texas' bays, rivers, lakes and streams have known problems with specific toxic pollutants or ambient toxicity.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#32">(32)</A> Dioxin, cadmium, chlordane, sulfate, chromium, mercury, copper and low dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform (signs of organic pollution) are the most frequent toxic contaminants, affecting 867 miles of rivers and streams in 1994.

<A NAME="POTENTIAL">SOURCES OF POTENTIAL</A> SURFACE WATER POLLUTION
</H4>
<P>
The causes of water pollution typically fall into one of two categories: point-source pollution and non-point-source pollution. The term "point-source pollution" refers to pollutants discharged from one discrete location or point, such as an industry or municipal plant. Pollutants discharged in this way might include, for example, fecal coliform bacteria and nutrients from sewage, heavy metals or synthetic organic contaminants. The term "non-point-source pollution" refers to pollutants that cannot be identified as coming from one discrete location or point. Examples are oil and grease that enter the water with runoff from urban streets or nitrogen from fertilizers and animal waste that wash into surface waters from agricultural lands. 
<P>
The sources of both point-source and non-point-source pollution are varied. Legally discharged wastewater effluents from municipalities and industries, as well as untreated or partially treated wastewater flows, can be major contributors to point-source pollution. Likely sources of non-point-source pollution - which is often difficult to discern - include range land, animal holding areas and runoff from urban streets. Natural and unknown causes of pollutants can also impact water quality which may also be related to human activities. For example, a highway or housing construction may help precipitate the runoff of natural pollution sources like sediment.<P><P>

<A NAME="ANTIDEGRADATION">*</A>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>&quot;ANTIDEGRADATION&quot; POLICY</TR></TH><TR><TD>
The antidegradation policy consists of three parts (or tiers). The first tier provides a minimum level of protection to all waters by prohibiting any activity which could affect the existing use (swimming, fishing) of the water, although its overall quality may be affected. A second tier is applied to those water bodies which have a "high" quality of water and prohibits any degradation of these waters, even if they can still meet their designated use. Thus, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission could deny a wastewater discharge permit on the grounds that it would degrade a high quality water. However, if it can be shown that such an activity is "necessary for important economic or social development," such high quality waters may be degraded. 
<P>
The third and most restrictive tier of the antidegradation policy allows states to designate Outstanding National Resource Waters, or ONRWs. These water bodies receive the highest level of protection under state water quality standards. Unlike high quality waters, no activity that would degrade such waters would be allowed, even if they were economically or socially needed by the region. Thus, additional wastewater discharge permits or construction requiring stormwater permits would probably not be allowed in an Outstanding National Resource Waters watershed.
<P>
In 1994, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission proposed designating Christmas Bay, South Bay near Port Isabel, Caddo Lake, stream segments in the Guadalupe Moun-tains National Park and the Barton Creek and Barton Springs in Austin as the state's first Outstanding National Resource Waters. However, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission later chose not to request Outstanding National Resource Waters designation for these five water bodies after opposition arose. In contrast, there are approximately 70 Outstanding National Resource Waters designated in Arkansas, 40 in Louisiana and 120 in Oklahoma.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#30">(30)</A>

<A NAME="POINT-SOURCE">POINT-SOURCE DISCHARGES</A> 
</H4>
<P>
Since the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act, most water pollution control efforts have focused on point-source pollution. Point-source pollution generally comes from the millions of gallons of wastewater discharged from the pipes of industrial facilities and municipal sewage treatment plants into rivers, streams, lakes and the ocean. Sources <BR>
of wastewater may include: domestic wastewater, inflow and infiltration - where stormwater and groundwater get into the wastewater collection system - commercial operations such as restaurants, food processing facilities, agricultural operations and industrial facilities.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#33">(33)</A>
<P>
Wastewater is considered a potential source of pollution because it may - especially if it is untreated or only partially treated - contain organic and inorganic materials which can be hazardous to both humans and other life forms. In many streams, treated wastewater may actually be cleaner than what is already contained in the stream; however, treated, untreated or partially treated wastewaters may also contain small amounts of radiation or toxics or increase the temperature of waters, affecting aquatic wildlife and habitat. Finally, discharged wastewater, especially if it is untreated or partially treated, may lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in the receiving stream (oxygen is required by microorganisms which consume the organic material). 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  Different organic materials in wastewaters require different amounts of oxygen - commonly known as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) - in order to break down and stabilize the material. The greater the Biochemical Oxygen Demand, the greater the oxygen depleting effect of the wastewater upon the receiving stream. The Biochemical Oxygen Demand of typical untreated domestic wastewater varies from 100 to 300 milligrams per liter. Chicken blood from a food processing plant, on the other hand, might require from 1,000 to 4,000 milligrams per liter of Biochemical Oxygen Demand to treat.

<P>
Since the 1977 Clean Water Act, all municipal and industrial dischargers have been required to obtain from the Environmental Protection Agency a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Despite its name, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit does not eliminate pollution; it instead is designed to control it by setting limits on the quality of the discharged wastewater. In Texas, the EPA administers the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, though the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission reviews permit applications to certify to the EPA that permittees meet Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. 
<P>
In addition to this federal permit, industrial and municipal dischargers must obtain a state wastewater permit from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. With this state permit process, the state establishes basic effluent limits for all facilities to protect surface water quality standards. 
<P>
Most National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits granted by the EPA are based upon the state permit. Both the EPA and state wastewater discharge permits are designed to meet the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. Sometimes there may be differences between the two permits due to different modeling techniques used in determining effluent limits (See "Surface Water Regulation Today" for a full discussion of state discharge permits).

<A NAME="TOXICS">TOXICS IN </A>TEXAS WASTEWATER DISCHARGES 
</H4>
<P>
Toxics are poisonous compounds that have been identified as being harmful to human health and the environment. Discharges of toxic water pollutants into the surface waters of the state are a mounting public concern. Some toxics are soluble in water and pose a threat to human health if the water is used for drinking or swimming. Other toxics are not soluble in water, but may become attached to sediment and be consumed by aquatic life forms, thereby entering into the food chain. This process, known as bioaccumulation, puts humans at risk if the toxics become concentrated in higher life forms like fish. 
<P>
Not until 1988 did limits on toxics became a major part of the water quality standards. Even now, though, if a facility discharges a substance classified as toxic under water quality standards set in 1991, that substance may not have been incorporated into the facility's original discharge permit. Thus, until the permit comes up for renewal, toxics that violate state standards may be released into state waters.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#34">(34)</A> In addition, state water quality standards address only 61 specific toxic compounds out of thousands of potential compounds. Thus, many chemicals could be directly discharged into Texas' surface waters without any discharge permit limits. 
<P>
Finally, some industries route their toxic discharges through publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs), which are often not designed to remove toxic chemicals and metals. While cities that discharge more than one million gallons a day are required to pretreat any wastewater that comes from industries, smaller cities are not. Most cities, large or small, require that the industrial facilities that release toxics through publicly-owned treatment works pretreat their wastewater to limit toxins. In addition, under federal law, 21 categories of industries must pretreat their waste to "best available technology" before discharging waste to a public wastewater treatment plant.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#35">(35)</A> However, neither industrial nor municipal pretreatment programs are universally applied or enforced.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#36">(36)</A> 
<P>
One of the best sources of information for the amount of toxics entering Texas waters is the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Under the federal Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act, manufacturing companies with 10 or more employees that use or manufacture more than 25,000 pounds per year of any of more than 320 toxic chemicals or chemical compounds must file an annual report with the state. This report documents their releases of toxics to the air, water, and land and details any transfers of toxics to hazardous waste facilities and publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#37">(37)</A> 
<P>
Though the Toxics Release Inventory is a useful tool, it gives only a partial picture of toxic releases into the environment. The program requires only manufacturing facilities to report, leaving out other industries which produce toxics and publicly-owned facilities like utilities. Also, there are more than 320 toxic compounds, and the Toxics ReleaseInventory does not track their releases.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#38">(38)</A> 
<P>
Texas manufacturers reported releases of 16.4 million pounds of toxic chemicals directly into surface water in 1992. However, about 80 percent of the 1992 total was due to an accidental spill of sulfuric and phosphoric acid by one company in Pasadena, Texas.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#39">(39)</A> Even discounting the spill, more than 70 percent of toxic water releases occurred in Harris and Jefferson counties, where petrochemical and refining industries are concentrated, and ten companies were responsible for 72 percent of these direct discharges to surface water. Largely because of the spill, Texas ranked second in the country in releases of toxics to surface water in 1992.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#40">(40)</A> In 1993, Texas facilities only released 2.3 million pounds of toxics into Texas streams and rivers.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#41">(41)</A>
<P>
In 1992, more than 32 million pounds of toxic chemicals were transferred to public sewage plants, causing Texas to rank second among the states in the amount of toxics released through sewage plants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#42">(42)</A> Almost 60 percent of these chemicals were produced by three companies in Pasadena, in the Houston/Bay Port region. Harris County was the site of about 80 percent of all toxics transferred to public sewers in 1992. In 1993, toxics transferred to public sewers declined to 22.5 million pounds.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#43">(43)</A>

<P>
Facilities that discharge wastewater directly into surface waters are required to submit to the state monthly effluent reports which show whether or not they meet their permit limits. In 1993, 766 industrial facilities and 1,873 municipalities were required to submit monthly effluent reports.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#44">(44)</A> In addition to these effluent reports, large municipalities and industries whose permits contain numerical limits on toxics are required to perform total toxicity testing, or biomonitoring, to determine whether their effluent is adversely affecting aquatic life. If biomonitoring reports - and two retests - show the effluent to be lethal to certain species, municipalities and industries must perform what's known as a TRE, or Toxicity Reduction Evaluation, to identify which toxics are affecting the species and adopt a plan to reduce the toxicity of their effluent. For example, there are currently 36 municipalities and 33 industrial facilities which have been required by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to reduce the toxicity of their effluent because of its lethality to species.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#45">(45)</A>
<P>
Where self-reports or inspections show violations, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission may begin enforcement action against a permittee. A municipal or industrial discharger must be non-compliant for four months for enforcement actions to be automatically undertaken. Besides these self-reporting requirements, permittees are subject to compliance inspections by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's 65 wastewater inspectors.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#46">(46)</A> These inspectors conduct annual inspections on a selected number of facilities. Due to cuts in funding for inspections, the number of facilities inspected has decreased, even as the number of violations or deficiencies, as determined by inspections and review of self-reporting data, has increased.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#47">(47)</A> 
<P>
Between 1990 and 1993, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission issued 253 enforcement orders with penalties for municipal and industrial wastewater discharge and water quality violations. These orders increased from 45 in 1990 to 75 in 1993.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#48">(48)</A>

While the treatment and discharge of most wastewater in Texas is managed through the permit system, some effluent is discharged into surface waters without treatment. In 1995, the state identified some 340,000 Texans living in unincorporated communities or colonias along the U.S.-Mexican border who had inadequate wastewater treatment facilities.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#49">(49)</A> These Texans use improperly operated septic tanks, outhouses, privies or no treatment at all before discharging their wastewater into surface water or into the ground. This practice affects the quality of both groundwater and surface water. 
<P>
The Rio Grande, the river which forms part of the border between Texas and Mexico, serves as both the major source of drinking water and the principle recipient of wastewater for the region. Water quality for many segments of the Rio Grande has been severely degraded over the years, in part because of the discharging of untreated or partially treated wastewater by Mexican cities. Together, the Mexican border cities of Ciudad Juarez, Ojinaga, Ciudad Acuntilde;a, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros discharge an estimated 175 million gallons of wastewater into the Rio Grande and Gulf of Mexico per day. About 112 million gallons per day is untreated. The remaining 63 million gallons receive only primary treatment, which means that solids and sludge have been removed but no chlorination or other chemical or biological treatment of the wastewater has occurred.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#52">(52)</A> In 1993 the U.S. and Mexican governments began construction of a joint wastewater treatment facility for Nuevo Laredo that should be completed in 1995. Similar international wastewater treatment plants are being planned for other border cities.

<TABLE BORDER=2 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>
HOW IS WASTEWATER PROCESSED?</TR></TH><TR><TD>Wastewater can undergo several levels of treatment, each of which makes the water progressively cleaner. The first level, called primary treatment, removes solids, usually by mechanical means. During secondary treatment water is aerated and microorganisms are used to remove remaining small particles. The water is then chlorinated. Tertiary treatment removes nitrates and phosphates before chlorination. 
<P>
Under federal law, publicly-owned treament works (POTWs) are required to treat wastewater to secondary treatment levels or better. In Texas, about 67 percent of domestic wastewater now receives advanced (tertiary) treatment before discharge. In 1972, that figure was less than 15 percent.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#50">(50)</A> 
<P>
Due to the high construction and operating costs of conventional systems, however, many smaller communities have begun looking into so-called innovative and alternative wastewater treatment plants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#51">(51)</A> Alternative collection systems often use smaller diameter pipes that follow the topography of the land to reduce excavation costs and take advantage of gravity flows. Innovative treatment systems may also utilize natural processes to reduce effluent contaminants to acceptable levels. These processes include using the wastewater to irrigate land, which uses the soil's biological activity to treat it. Or the system may rely on specially constructed wetlands, which physically filter the water and break down contaminants through biological and microbial activity.

<A NAME="NON-POINT">NON-POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
Apart from point-source discharges, toxics and other pollutants can enter surface water through urban and agricultural runoff, seepage from land-fills and hazardous waste facilities, spills on land <BR>
or water and seepage from underground injection sites. They can also be carried by acid rain, which occurs when air-born contaminants are absorbed by clouds and return to earth in the rain. The impact of non-point-source pollution on water quality is significant: the EPA now estimates that non-point-source pollution accounts for 65 percent of pollution in rivers, 76 percent in lakes and 45 percent in estuaries in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#53">(53)</A>
<P>The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act were the first comprehensive attempt by the federal government to control non-point-source pollution (NPS) from urban streets and sewers as well as from agricultural activities. The law requires states to conduct an assessment of waters contaminated by non-point-source pollution and to devise best manage- ment pollution-abatement plans to help clean these waters up. The law also provides funding to the states for up to 60 percent of the cost of implementing these plans. Between 1990 and 1993, Texas received about $2 million in federal funds for a variety of abatement programs.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#54">(54)</A> 
<P>In addition to this federal money, the state supports some pilot projects to control non-point-source pollution. Finally, some local governments have adopted their own non-point-source pollution abatement programs. 
<P>In Texas, the 1995 Water Quality Inventory and a 1990 non-point-source report show that urban and agricultural run-off has helped pollute 26 percent of the impaired river miles, 17 percent of the impaired reservoir acres and 15 percent of the square miles of impaired estuarine waters.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#55">(55)</A> (Another 566 miles of impaired river and streams due to unknown sources may also be related to non-point-source pollution.) However, it is important to note that these percentages are based upon suppositions. Even so, actual effects of non-point-source pollution on Texas' surface waters are probably much greater. Despite these documented effects on Texas rivers, lakes and streams, pollution abatement and management plans have not been implemented in most areas in Texas. Part of the difficulty is identifying the origin of the non-point-source pollution that affects water quality. One of the major purposes of the state's 1991 Clean Rivers Act - which requires river authorities to assess the water quality of their river basins - is to establish better data regarding non-point-source causes and impacts. Though it is by definition difficult to pinpoint where non-point-source pollution originates, most such pollution can be grouped into two broad categories: agricultural and urban.
<H4>
<A NAME="AGRICULTURAL">AGRICULTURAL NON-POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
Agricultural activity accounts for most of the <I>reported </I>cases of non-point-source pollution in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#56">(56)</A> The irrigation of crops, the application of fertilizers to pasture or range land and the use of feedlots all generate such non-point-source pollutants as plant nutrients, pesticides, sediment and animal waste. 
<P>
<B>Confined Animal Feeding Operations</B>
<P>A major contributor of non-point-source pollution are Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), facilities that house in a relatively concentrated area animals used for the production of eggs, milk and meat. Confined Animal Feeding Operations generate a variety of potential pollutants. Animal waste contain pathogens, chlorides and potassium salts and high levels of nitrogen. Confined Animal Feeding Operations may degrade state waters by increasing nutrient loads and fecal coliform in many rivers. This type of contamination ultimately lowers dissolved oxygen levels, which threatens the viability of aquatic habitats and consequently the use of the river for fishing, swimming or drinking. 
<P>State regulations now prohibit these facilities from discharging wastewater or animal waste directly into streams and rivers. Operators must also not allow the waste to run off the site, where it could contaminate surface or groundwater. Currently, all large Confined Animal Feeding Operations must obtain a no-discharge permit from the state, which requires that they control runoff except when there is excessive rain.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#57">(57)</A> Most large cattle operations are located in the Panhandle, while dairy farm operations are concentrated in Erath County, near Stephenville.
<P>Even the smaller non-permitted Confined Animal Feeding Operations are expected to comply with the no-discharge policy. The state can initiate an enforcement action on these facilities if they discharge into the state's waters. 
<P>In 1993, the Texas Legislature transferred much of the responsibility for regulating non-permitted, smaller Confined Animal Feeding Operations 
from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board. The move was designed to change the state's oversight of these operations from a traditional regulatory role to a technical assistance role. The Soil and Water Conservation Board is expected to help agriculture adopt better run-off control practices, mainly through Waste Management Plans, allowing them to come into compliance voluntarily. 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  An average open feedlot receives about 300 tons of manure containing 24,000 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year. By contrast, animals on typical open rangeland deposit about 1/10 tons of manure containing eight pounds of nitrogen per acre per year. <P><I>Source: John M. Sweeten, Charles Baird and Leah Manning, "Animal Waste Management," </I>Agricultural and Silviculture Non-Point-Source Pollution Management, # L-5043 <I>(Temple: Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board and Texas Agricultural Extension Service, 1991), 1.</I></UL>
<P>This animal waste is often used to fertilize crops, and if overused, can lead to polluting runoff. Animal wastewater is often collected in ponds for use in irrigation. These holding ponds - which are intended to prevent run-off - can overflow with heavy rainfall, or may leach into the soil, eventually contaminating groundwater. 
<P>The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has developed "best management practices" for Confined Animal Feeding Operations designed to limit runoff. These practices include:
<UL><LI>Maintaining a buffer zone between irrigated crop land and sites where solids are disposed;
<LI>Restricting land application of manure to areas at least 150 feet from waterways;
<LI>Avoiding application of manure on land subject to erosion;
<LI>Reusing the water used to flush manure from paved surfaces for irrigation; 
<LI>Constructing ditches and waterways above and around open lots to divert runoff;
<LI>Constructing lined water-retention facilities to contain rainfall and runoff; 
<LI>Avoiding the use of areas that have a high slope, making runoff retention impossible; 
<LI>Applying solid manure at a rate that optimizes use of the nitrogen it contains for a given crop;<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#59">(59)</A>
<LI>Allowing excess wastewater to evaporate by applying it evenly to land.</UL> 
<P>
<H5>Other Agricultural Non-Point-Source Pollution</H5>
Apart from Confined Animal Feeding Operations, other agricultural activities may contribute other sources of non-point-source pollution. runoff from croplands may dump fertilizers and pesticides <BR>
into surface waters. runoff from rangeland often contains eroded soil, which causes sedimentation of rivers and streams. It may also contain high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus from animal waste and fertilizers. In Texas, from 1968 to 1990, 470 out of nearly 55,000 samples of surface water tested for nitrates exceeded the recommended drinking water standard of 10 mg/L. Though this overall rate of violations is low - less than one percent - the problem samples were concentrated in a handful of counties, indicating a potentially serious regional problem with nitrate contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>Surface water in Texas has not been extensively monitored for pesticides. However, arsenic, which is used in some pesticides, has been identified in several counties as a surface water concern. About 5 percent of total samples taken by the state between 1968 and 1990 exceeded the drinking water standard of 50 ug/L for arsenic. Since arsenic occurs naturally and is also an industrial pollutant, it is difficult to pinpoint the source of arsenic in surface water. Most of the samples that exceeded standards were collected in counties with high industrial activity as well as agricultural production.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#61">(61)</A>

<TR><TH>
EXAMPLES OF NON-POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAMS IN TEXAS</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Federally Funded Projects</B>
<P><OL>
<LI>The federal government has funded a demonstration project in the Lower Rio Grande Valley to manage nutrient application to agricultural lands and use an integrated pest management program in certain agricultural activities. These techniques are being tested for their effectiveness in limiting nutrient and pesticide loadings into the nearby Arroyo Colorado, which feeds into the Laguna Madre, an ecologically sensitive estuarine system. 
<P><LI>The federal government has also funded a Dairy Outreach Program to help dairy operations in Erath County limit discharge and run-off of animal waste. This project is jointly managed with the State Soil Conservation Board and Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.</OL> 
<P>
<B>State Funded Project</B>
<P>
Texas has funded a study of run-off from El Paso-area colonias, or unincorporated communities along the U.S.- Mexico border that lack adequate wastewater treatment. 
<P>
<B>Local Pollution Abatement Program</B>
<P>
Under state regulations, municipalities have the authority to adopt ordinances designed to protect water quality. In Texas, the two cities which have adopted the most far-reaching regulations to protect water quality are Austin and San Antonio.
<P>
The City of Austin has adopted an ordinance designed to prevent development from affecting stream water quality in the sensitive Barton Springs watershed. The controversial ordinance, passed by voters in 1992, limits impervious cover - the percentage of land covered by pavement or buildings - in any new development along the watershed of Austin's streams and creeks. Impervious cover cannot exceed 15 percent in the recharge zone of Barton Springs and 25 percent in the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer contributing zone, which feeds into Barton Springs.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#58">(58)</A>
<P>
In San Antonio, where the Edwards Aquifer is currently the sole source of water, a new water quality ordinance approved this year by the City Council expands zoning authority within city limits. The water quality ordinance also places limits on impervious cover in areas of the city's extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJ) which are located above the aquifer. 
</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P><P>
<H4><A NAME="URBAN">URBAN NON-POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION</A></H4>
Water that enters streams and rivers from urban areas is often routed through a stormwater drainage system which collects rainwater. These systems are usually separate from wastewater treatment systems. Typically, rainfall picks up contaminants like oil and grease from roads, herbicides and pesticides from lawns and gardens and household chemicals improperly disposed of by residents. 
<P>
Cities which have a population more than 100,000 must obtain a stormwater discharge permit from the EPA under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Also requiring an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit are all construction projects that disturb more than five acres of land. Thus, stormwater is a permitted point-source, despite the non-point-source nature of the contamination itself. 
<P>
Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, large cities and construction companies are required to treat stormwater and develop management techniques to address these pollution sources (see box). 
<P>
<B>Construction, Pollution and Impervious Cover</B>
<P>
Construction, especially that associated with highway building, can also be a major source of sediment and other non-point-source pollution. The Texas Department of Transportation requires contractors to meet standards for mitigation of construction run-off during roadwork, but many environmentalists consider these standards inadequate. They argue that construction and development inevitably increase impervious cover, which prevents rain from being absorbed into the ground and thereby increases runoff that can contaminate streams and rivers. 
<P>
Section 26.177 of the Texas Water Code will require all Texas cities with a population of more than 5,000 to submit a pollution abatement plan 
to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. These abatement plans must address both storm sewer discharges and urban runoff.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#63">(63)</A> 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  EPA estimates that each American household generates 20 pounds of home-chemical waste each year, much of which is disposed of improperly and ends up in rivers, lakes and aquifers. In an effort to control this non-point-source pollution, many communities have set up home-chemical waste programs to encourage proper disposal of household chemicals. In Texas, such programs are voluntary. </UL>

WHO MUST PERMIT THEIR STORMWATER?</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
While Texas has no state-level stormwater permitting program, municipal and industrial wastewater permits may include requirements to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff. In 1991, for example, 439 of 966 industrial permits regulated stormwater discharges from industry.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#62">(62)</A> 
<P>Because the federal government has not delegated to Texas responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, federal stormwater permits are issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act required that stormwater discharges be permitted in two phases. Phase 1, which has been completed across the nation, required all pre-1987 dischargers as well as industries, construction projects covering more than five acres, and cities of more than 100,000 population with a separate stormwater sewer system to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Under Phase II, which began October 1, 1994, most other stormwater dischargers, including cities of less than 100,000 population and businesses such as commercial and retail outlets may be required to obtain an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.

<A NAME="POLLUTION">WHERE POLLUTION</A> OCCURS IN TEXAS
</H4>
<P>The state has ranked its rivers, streams, reservoirs and bays in terms of severity of pollution. The ranking system was based in part on how well the water body met traditional water-quality parameters (bacteria, chlorides, dissolved oxygen content, temperature, etc.), and in part on such criteria as reported fish kills, known municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, extent of non-point-source pollution, known toxicity problems and other information.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#64">(64)</A> The most polluted rivers are concentrated in southeast and central south Texas. The most polluted reservoirs and lakes are mainly in central and eastern Texas.

<H4><A NAME="AUTHORITIES">RIVER AUTHORITIES</A> LOOK AT WATER QUALITY
</H4>
<P>Under a 1991 state law, local river authorities and coastal basin authorities are required to assess their river basins every two years, identifying major water quality issues. In 1992, all river authorities identified the lack of monitoring, and the resulting limited water-quality data, as the major water quality issue.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>For a number of river authorities, a high level of fecal coliform bacteria was identified as a major water quality problem. Water quality standards for fecal coliform are designed to prevent human illness since they are an indicator of other pathogens that cause infectious diseases like hepatitis and cholera. High fecal coliform levels were found in 20 of the 23 coastal and river basins and 49 percent of all classified segments. The high levels in the coastal areas have led to the closing of oyster harvesting areas. 
<P>Other river authorities identified toxics as a major concern. Many toxic chemicals, including pesticides, solvents and other organics and inorganic chemicals and metals have been linked to birth defects, cancer and other diseases. Specific toxic materials identified by river authorities, based on limited monitoring data, include pesticides like Aldrin, and PCBs, banned for new uses. Most toxicity problems pinpointed by the river basin assessments relate to high levels of nickel, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, which probably are from industrial sources. In about 23 percent of the reported cases of fish kills over the last four years, toxic pollutants were the cause.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#66">(66)</A> In two water bodies, the Rio Grande downstream of Laredo/Nuevo Laredo, and the Alligator Bayou in the Neches-Trinity coastal river basin, unusually high numbers of fish abnormalities indicate problems with toxic pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>Fourteen of the river authorities identified low oxygen levels as a major water quality concern. This condition, also referred to as high biological oxygen demand (BOD), is considered one of the most obvious indicators of degraded water quality because it directly impacts aquatic life. It may result from high nutrient levels, urban runoff, or excessive organic loading from wastewater discharges. 
<P>Eight river authorities identified high levels of nutrients - usually phosphorus, nitrogen ammonia and nitrates - as a major water quality issue. Wastewater discharges, improperly functioning wastewater systems, septic tanks, agricultural run-off and other kinds of non-point-source pollution were identified as probable sources of these nutrient loadings. While excess plant nutrients pose no direct threat to human health, they do lead to excess vegetation which can choke off rivers and lakes and eventually reduce dissolved oxygen, affecting fish and other aquatic species. 
<P>Three coastal-area river authorities listed degradation of habitat as a major water quality concern. Development, erosion and the dredging and filling of coastal areas have destroyed some animal habitat in rivers and streams. The result has been a reduction in biodiversity in the area.
<P>In addition to these water quality problems identified by river authorities, excessive levels of toxics such as metals and pesticides in edible fish tissue has led the Texas Department of Health to issue total bans on consumption of fish and shellfish in four river segments, one entire reservoir and two bay segments (see "Coastal Water" <I>s</I>ection for details). The Texas Department of Health has issued fish consumption advisories in 14 other water bodies.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#72">(72)</A> 
<P>Fishing in areas that have been closed to fishing and keeping those fish is a violation of state law. Most recently, following the discovery of fish contaminated with high levels of PCBs, the Department of Health declared the Donna Reservoir and Irrigation Canal closed to fishing.

<TR><TH>FISHING FOR PCBs?</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Like most states, Texas has no comprehensive fish monitoring program. The state does test fish tissue for contaminants when a report of a chemical <BR>
spill or some other information leads state health officials to believe human health may be threatened. But no systematic monitoring is done in the absence of these reports. Testing fish is expensive; a detailed tissue sampling of one fish might cost $500 and a full scan, which examines the liver and reproductive organs to pinpoint sources of dangerous contaminants, might exceed $1,000 per sample.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#68">(68)</A> 
<P>The Texas Department of Health's Shellfish Control Division is charged with surveillance of miles of oyster-harvesting areas along the Gulf Coast and has the authority to close bays and estuaries. This program is funded in part by a $1-per-sack fee paid by oyster fishermen. But no comparable revenue source is available for testing inland fish.
<P>Yet there is evidence that such monitoring is warranted. In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a study on the types of environmental problems to which Texas families living along the border are exposed. As part of the study, EPA tested a carp caught by a Brownsville family from the Donna Reservoir. The tests of the fish's tissue revealed PCB levels of 400 parts per million, or 200 times the recommended limit for human consumption.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#69">(69)</A> When further tests of Donna Reservoir fish identified eight more fish contaminated by PCB, the Texas Department of Health issued a fish consumption advisory for the reservoir and its connecting canals. Ten more PCB-contaminated fish caught from an irrigation canal between the reservoir and the Rio Grande River were found in January 1994. Following this study, Texas Department of Health banned any taking or consumption of fish in the area.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#70">(70)</A> 
<P>PCBs have been banned in the U.S. since the late 1970s because they cause liver disorders and developmental delays in infants. (The only exception is for use in electrical transformers.) To date, officials have been unable to identify the source of the PCBs found in the Donna area. 
<P>While startling, the problems at Donna with PCBs are not unique. Over the last ten years, Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission officials have also identified nine segments around the state where concentrations of PCBs in whole fish tissue has been above concern levels.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#71">(71)</A>

<H3><A NAME="GROUNDWATER">GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS</A></H3>
<H4>
<A NAME="BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>
</H4>
<P>
Like surface water, groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from a variety of sources. In Texas, all nine major aquifers and 20 minor aquifers have experienced some form of contamination. These contamination problems stem partly from development and industry and partly from overpumping, which causes infiltration of saline waters. 
<P>
Despite these contamination problems, state laws do not protect groundwater to the extent that they do surface water. There are, for example, no groundwater quality standards to parallel those for surface water. The state does have standards in place for groundwater stored for drinking water, but apart from these public health standards, state law does not apply environmental standards to groundwater. 
<P>
Clean groundwater is needed for more than drinking purposes. Agriculture depends heavily on groundwater for irrigation; in 1990, some 79 percent of all groundwater pumped was used for crop irrigation.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#73">(73)</A> Poor or contaminated groundwater could jeopardize crops and threaten the health of livestock. 
<P>
Clean groundwater is also essential to clean surface water. Groundwater is connected to surface water in the hydrological cycle and some aquifers actually feed area springs and rivers. For example, the Edwards Aquifer is the major source for Central Texas rivers through the Comal and San Marcos Springs. Poor quality water - or a lack of water - harms the springs and their aquatic life as well as downstream users. 
<P>
Sometimes contamination occurs naturally. Saline water from deeper aquifers may reach aquifers that provide water for humans. Some groundwater may have naturally high background levels of nitrates, metals, iron, sulfate or chloride, all of which can give water an odd odor, color or taste. 
<P>
Groundwater contamination has become a major public policy concern in recent decades, as citizens and public officials alike have learned how human activity has impacted water quality. Landfills for both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, improperly completed or abandoned water wells, oil- and gas-related wells, petroleum storage tanks, agricultural pesticides and leaking septic tanks are all potential sources for contaminants that can seep down to the aquifer. Deep petroleum, mining and injection wells can likewise directly pollute aquifers.

<H4>TYPICAL ROUTES OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION</H4>

<H4>
<A NAME="SOURCES">SOURCES OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
It is difficult to ascertain how much groundwater contamination has resulted from human activities. The state does, however, track instances of contamination. The Texas Groundwater Protection Committee, which includes three state agencies that regulate activities that can cause groundwater contamination - the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the Railroad Commission of Texas and the Texas Department of Agriculture - reported 5,670 instances of groundwater contamination between 1989 and 1993 which had yet to be cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#74">(74)</A> These figures represent only the cases reported and confirmed. 
<P>
Although the state conducts no comprehensive water quality assessment for aquifers, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has ranked the aquifers' vulnerability to contamination using a model known as the DRASTIC index. This index looks at both hydrological and geological components of the aquifers to gauge the potential for groundwater pollution. 
<P>
<A NAME="UNDERGROUND"><B>Underground Storage Tanks</A></B>
<P>
From 1989 through 1993, the source of groundwater contamination in 85 percent of the reported cases to the Texas Groundwater Protection Committee was an underground or above ground storage tank. Usually these were petroleum storage tanks used by gas stations. To date, 825 of the 5,718 documented cases (about 15 percent) have been successfully cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#75">(75)</A> 
<P>
There are some 150,000 underground and 17,000 above ground storage tanks registered with the TNRCC. Most contain petroleum products like diesel fuel, waste oil and gasoline. A smaller number store regulated hazardous substances. Of the 5,718 cases of groundwater contamination reported since the state began monitoring the tanks in 1989, about a third are located in the Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas (see <I>County Indicators</I> for a complete list). <A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
In 1989, the Texas Legislature created a fee-supported reimbursement fund that enables the state to assume clean-up costs when the party responsible for contamination is unwilling or unable to pay or cannot be located. From 1990 to 1993, almost $200 million from this fund was spent on petroleum storage tank clean-up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#77">(77)</A> However, fee revenue has not been sufficient to pay for all the necessary clean-ups and the Legislature has had to appropriate emergency funds. Contamination from petroleum storage tanks has affected not only groundwater quality but also real estate values in some areas, as prospective buyers have considered clean-up costs and pollution liability.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#78">(78)</A>

</CENTER><P>

<A NAME="INJECTION"><B>Injection Wells</A></B>
<P>
Injection wells, where pressurized liquid waste or other fluids are injected into aquifers, are a major method of disposal for industrial and hazardous waste. Injection wells are also used to help recover oil, gas and minerals. For example, injection wells are used to inject fresh water into an underground oil field for secondary recovery of oil. Uranium and sulfur are often mined by injecting hot water into formations to loosen up these materials. 
<P>
Injection wells are not a new technology. Beginning in the 1920s, deep wells were injected with superheated water to recover liquid sulfur. As far back as 1938, salt water extracted from the ground along with oil from an East Texas oil field was returned to the lower part of the formation via an injection well.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Injection wells have been involved in a number of controversial lawsuits and permit battles, as well as high-profile groundwater contamination cases, usually resulting from improper handling of the waste at the surface prior to injection (see <I>Waste </I>chapter ). According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, there have been no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination from the injection of hazardous and other industrial waste in the last five years. However, in the case of injection wells used for mining, the movement of mining fluids into groundwater is not considered a case of groundwater contamination so long as the facility cleans up the water and assures that it does not spread past the mining area. All groundwater contamination resulting from these activities has been cleaned up. 
<P>
In Texas, 116 underground injection wells are currently used by generators of hazardous and non-hazardous waste or by owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities. Approximately 65 other wells are in various stages of permitting by the Texas Natural Resource Conser- vation Commission or have stopped operations.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#80">(80)</A> Together, Texas' industries injected approximately 14.8 million tons of hazardous waste on-site, and sent an additional 183,900 tons to Texas commercial facilities in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#81">(81)</A>

<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  It is estimated that from 1961 through 1981, more than 60 billion gallons of industrial waste have been disposed of in underground injection wells in Texas. <P><I>Source: Texas Department of Water Resources,</I> Underground Injection Operations in Texas<I>, 3-11.</UL></I>
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas has jurisdiction over injection wells used to inject oil and gas waste, a term that includes all waste incidental to drilling for production of oil, gas or geothermal resources. Most waste consist of saltwater, which is recovered along with natural gas during drilling. The Railroad Commission can also issue permits for wells to be used for secondary recovery or to store hydrocarbons. Some 12,475 salt-water disposal wells, 40,000 secondary-recovery wells and 545 hydrocarbon and gas storage wells are currently under the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#82">(82)</A> In 1993, two cases of groundwater contamination related to Railroad Commission-permitted injection wells were documented in Runnels and Matagorda counties.
<P>
Another class of injection wells are those used for uranium or sulfur mining or for the recovery of brine (subsurface salt deposits). These wells can contribute to the contamination of groundwater by increasing its salinity.
<P>
Most of the 81 brine-mining facilities operating in Texas are located in the High Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Thirty-four uranium mining sites, three sodium sulfate mining sites and six sulfur mining sites have been permitted in South Central Texas, near San Antonio. All of the uranium mines and 75 of the 81 brine mines are required to sample and monitor groundwater quarterly because of potential contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#83">(83)</A> In general, injection wells used in mining are not as deep as those used for injection of waste. They are thus more likely to impact near-surface water used for drinking. 
<P>
Other types of wells used in Texas include wells to inject urban or agricultural runoff that has been stored in surface ponds; water used in air conditioning systems; human waste from septic tanks; and fresh surface water or treated wastewater to recharge depleted aquifers. 
<P>
The Lower Rio Grande Valley is the major area of Texas where agricultural drainage wells are used. These wells help eliminate excess water from agricultural production. Because this part of the state is flat and has clay soils and high water tables, there is limited surface drainage. Agricultural drainage wells collect near-surface waters and drain them into subsurface formations. They dispose of waters containing nitrates, dissolved solids and pesticides, all of which have a high potential for contamination of groundwater. 
<P>
These wells are used mainly in citrus production, which has been rapidly declining in the Valley.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#84">(84)</A> Some 108 wells have been located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley counties of Hidalgo and Starr and in south-central Runnels County. Other agricultural drainage wells are located in Oldham County, where they could impact the Ogallala Aquifer.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#85">(85)</A>
<P>
<A NAME="OTHERWELLS"><B>Other Wells</B></A>
<P>
Groundwater may also be affected by the thousands of Texas wells drilled for water or for oil and gas exploration. When improperly drilled or cased, or when the casing has corroded, old oil, gas, and water wells serve as conduits for contamination of the aquifers below. Improperly completed and abandoned water wells may allow direct access from the surface to groundwater for contaminants such as pesticides, or they may facilitate the comingling of groundwater from one aquifer to another. Additionally, they can be a safety hazard to humans and livestock.
<P>
There are an estimated 600,000 individual water wells in Texas, of which 150,000 are conservatively estimated to be abandoned.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#86">(86)</A> The Texas Water Development Board estimates that about 20,000 new wells are drilled each year, most of which are not properly inventoried.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#87">(87)</A> Currently, all new wells must meet specific casing and construction standards and abandoned wells must be plugged. This plugging activity is overseen by the Water Well Drillers Team, since 1993 a division of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. About 150 wells per month are plugged by individual landowners and reported to the Water Well Drillers Team.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#88">(88)</A> However, abandoned water wells are considered one of the greatest sources of pollution of groundwater within Texas and may rank first in priority for mitigation by the state.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#89">(89)</A>
<P>
In addition to water wells, an estimated 1.5 million holes have been drilled in this century for oil- and gas-related activities. About 1 million of these remain improperly plugged.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#90">(90)</A> Abandoned oil wells are channels for the upward movement of brine - saltwater often found in oil-bearing zones - and paths to contamination by oil and gas, drilling fluids and other contaminants. Salt water from abandoned oil wells has contributed to pollution in the upper portions of the Colorado River.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#91">(91)</A> These wells must be plugged to prevent the contamination of aquifers by salt water and oil waste. 
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas has regulated the oil industry since 1901 when pipelines were designated as a form of interstate transport on a par with railroads. Currently, 367,188 oil and gas wells across the state are registered with the Railroad Commission, about 86,000 of which are not currently producing.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#92">(92)</A> Some 30,210 of these wells may need to be plugged in the coming years to prevent contamination of aquifers. 
<P>
To address the large number of unplugged wells, the Texas Legislature in 1984 created an Abandoned Well Plugging Fund, which has spent $54 million and has helped plug approximately 7,500 wells over the past ten years.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#93">(93)</A>
<P>
<A NAME="OTHEROIL"><B>Other Oil and Gas Industry Impacts</A></B>
<P>
The EPA estimates that about one million tons of hazardous waste is produced each year in American oil fields.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#94">(94)</A> The disposal of this waste has the potential to affect groundwater. Until 1969, when the Railroad Commission adopted its no pit rule - also known as Statewide Rule 8 - oil companies typically disposed of salt water and chemicals in open pits, creeks and roads. The chemicals used during the oil-well drilling process and disposed of in these pits include such highly toxic elements as barium, arsenic and cadmium. 
<P>
Today, the storage and disposal of major oil and gas waste requires a permit or authorization. Statewide Rule 8 identifies three types of oil field pits: prohibited pits, authorized pits and authorized pits through a permit. Authorized activities include land farming, where toxic materials are mixed with soils; burial; road-spreading; commercial hauling, treatment and disposal; and the use of pits such as reserve pits, fresh mining water pits and others. Other pits such as saltwater disposal pits, brine pits, drilling fluid storage and disposal pits, and gas plant evaporation and retention pits require a permit from the Railroad Commission.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#95">(95)</A> There are currently 76 land farming facilities permitted for disposal of oil and gas waste and 4,979 lined pits permitted for storage or disposal of such waste.
<P>
In 1993, the Railroad Commission reported 20 new cases of groundwater contamination due to hydrocarbons, crude oil, chlorides and hydrochloric acid. These cases added to the 44 cases from previous years which had not yet been cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#96">(96)</A> Contamination from oil and gas activities may in fact be higher; the Railroad Commission monitors only 75 groundwater monitoring wells associated with 53 disposal sites out of more than 5,000 permitted sites.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#97">(97)</A>

<A NAME="HAZARDOUS"><B>Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
Another serious threat to groundwater in Texas comes from abandoned hazardous waste sites. Many of these sites are regulated through the federal Superfund program, which designates abandoned hazardous waste sites for clean-up by placing them on a National Priorities List. States may also designate hazardous waste sites on a state Superfund list. Texas now has 30 federally designated Superfund sites on the National Priorities List, and 42 sites proposed or listed on the state Superfund registry (See <I>Waste </I>section for more detail). All of these sites are subject to groundwater monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Seven sites on the federal Superfund list, and eight on the state Superfund list are directly related to the production of oil and gas. Twenty-five of the federally designated sites and 13 of the state sites show contamination of groundwater by such constituents as arsenic, lead, chromium and PCBs. 
<P>
In addition to these Superfund sites, industrial and municipal hazardous-waste disposal facilities have been responsible for 456 cases of groundwater contamination in Texas between 1989 and 1993, none of which has yet been cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#98">(98)</A> Another 38 abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites not designated as Superfund sites by either the state or the federal government have been the source of confirmed groundwater contamination. Municipal solid waste facilities have been linked with another 24 cases of contamination. Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites and municipal landfills are discussed more fully in the section entitled <I>Waste. </I>
<P>
<A NAME="AGRICULTURE"><B>Agriculture</A></B>
<P>
As they have degraded surface water, agricultural and forestry activities have also degraded groundwater quality in Texas. Unauthorized discharges and runoff from Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) have been responsible for nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater. (However, excess nitrate in groundwater can be caused by other sources, such as poorly designed or old septic tanks.) The primary causes of agriculture-related groundwater contamination are runoff from Confined Animal Feeding Operations, pastures and barnyards; excessive nitrogen fertilization of crop land; and land-clearing and other agricultural practices which change soil composition, altering its ability to filter out pollutants. 
<P>
Agricultural chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides are also a major concern for groundwater protection. From 1987 to 1990, the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA), which regulates pesticide use, surveyed water wells for pesticide residues in 11 counties. The Texas Department of Agriculture discovered 75 cases of pesticide-contaminated groundwater. The pesticides found included arsenic, dicamba, atrazine and prometon. In addition to these data, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission since 1991 has kept an Inter-agency Pesticide Database, which compiles the results of sporadic groundwater monitoring for pesticides statewide. An additional 24 cases of pesticide contamination of groundwater were listed in this database, seven of which were identified in 1993.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#99">(99)</A> 
<P>
Other risks to groundwater from agricultural activities include contamination by nitrates and arsenic. High nitrate levels are sometimes caused by infiltration from fertilizers and animal waste. Contamination by arsenic, which the Texas Water Development Board found in three Panhandle counties (Howard, Martin and Reagan) between 1972 and 1989, could be caused by arsenic-based pesticides, by naturally occurring arsenics or a combination. These high levels of arsenic were mainly found in wells pumping from the Ogallala aquifer, which is the major source of drinking and irrigation water for the Panhandle and High Plains region of Texas.

<H3><A NAME="DRINKING">DRINKING WATER</A></H3>
<H4>
<A NAME="FEDERAL">FEDERAL DRINKING WATER LAW</A>
</H4>
<P>
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, enacted in 1974 and amended in 1986, was designed to ensure safe drinking water by establishing drinking water standards for treated water and by creating special protection for underground sources of drinking water. 
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  An adult drinks about 2 liters of water a day. <P><I>(Source: Richard Denison and John Ruston, eds.,</I> Recycling and Incineration: Evaluating the Choices<I>, (Washington, DC: Island Press for the Environmental Defense Fund, 1990), 222.</I></UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="TYPE">TYPES OF WATER SYSTEMS</A>
</H4>
<P>
The law classifies public water systems into two major categories. Those serving permanent populations like cities and towns are called "community systems." Those serving facilities like hotels, restaurants, youth camps, highway rest stops and travel trailer campgrounds are called "non-community systems." These non-community systems are further divided into those serving a transient population, such as users of restuarants and campgrounds, and those serving a non-transient population like hotels and schools. Of the approximately 7,200 public water systems in Texas, about 4,600 are community systems and 2,600 are non-community systems.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#100">(100)</A>
<P>
Under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the level of regulation depends on the type of system. Transient non-community systems are required only to monitor and treat for nitrate and nitrites and fecal coliform. Both community systems and non-transient non-community systems must monitor and treat water to standards set by the federal government and enforced by the states. Communities with less than 15 connections or 25 people are not considered to be "public water systems" and are therefore not regulated at all.
<H4>
<A NAME="PROTECTIONS">PROTECTIONS FOR UNDERGROUND DRINKING WATER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act contains a number of safeguards to protect groundwater used for drinking water. First, the Act's Sole Source Aquifer provision gives special protection to aquifers designated as the sole source of drinking water in the area. Any construction or development project that could impact that sole source aquifer cannot receive federal assistance. In Texas, the Edwards Aquifer, which supplies San Antonio with drinking water, has been designated as a sole source aquifer for all or part of Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, Comal and Hays Counties. Interestingly, the Edwards Aquifer is the only major supply of water in Texas that requires no advanced treatment. The water is merely pumped out of the aquifer, chlorinated and drunk by over one million San Antonio residents.
<P>
The Act's second major safeguard for groundwater is its Wellhead Protection Program. This provision seeks to protect from man-made contamination the wells used for municipal water supplies as well as the land surrounding those wells (known as well supply areas). To participate in the Wellhead Protection Program a city must conduct a field inventory to identify all potential sources of contaminants for the public water supply, and must adopt an ordinance that requires generators of contaminants to use best management practices to reduce the risk of contamination. It may also require limits on certain agricultural or industrial activities to prevent contamination from occurring. Since the program's inception in Texas, 171 local governments have delineated 856 wellhead protection areas encompassing 1,550 public water supply wells. Fifteen Texas cities have adopted wellhead protection ordinances to plug abandoned wells and limit the potential for contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#101">(101)</A> 
<H4>
<A NAME="STATE">THE STATE PROGRAM</A>
</H4>
<P>
In Texas, EPA has delegated authority for regulating drinking water to the state government. Currently, the state requires water systems to test for 126 chemicals, of which 72 have Maximum Contaminant Levels or MCLs. These include 21 volatile organic compounds, 33 synthetic organics, 15 inorganics and 3 radionuclides. In addition, the state requires public water suppliers to test for bacteria, lead and copper, and for 16 secondary contaminants such as iron, manganese and chloride which do not affect human health but lead to odor or taste problems.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#102">(102)</A>
<H4>
<A NAME="THREATS">THREATS TO DRINKING WATE</A>R
</H4>
<P>
While the list of potential drinking water contaminants is large and continues to grow, two sources pose the most acute threat to human health: nitrates and bacteria. Nitrates in concentrations above the national standard can threaten the health of infants. They can react with the blood's hemoglobin, interfering with its ability to carry oxygen and resulting in the sometimes fatal blue baby syndrome. Bacteria in contaminated water can cause diseases such as typhoid, cholera, infectious hepatitis and dysentery.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#103">(103)</A> These disease-causing bacteria are signaled by high levels of coliform bacteria, itself a relatively benign bacteria. Fecal coliform bacteria are commonly found in human and animal waste and may indicate sewage contamination and the presence of disease-causing organisms. 
<P>
Lead in drinking water is another major concern. Lead usually enters the drinking supply after the water has left the treatment plant. It comes from old lead pipes in homes, from brass fixtures or from lead-based solder in copper pipes.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#104">(104)</A> Lead is now banned in the installation or repair of public water systems and household plumbing. Even though most systems in Texas are not built with lead pipes, 70 municipal and industrial water systems throughout the state exceeded lead standards in 1992 and 1993.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#105">(105)</A> Fortunately, these systems represented less than 3 percent of all systems tested in the state.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#106">(106)</A>

<H4>HOW DRINKING WATER IS MADE IN A LARGE SYSTEM</H4>

<IMG SRC="g.drinking.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Diagram of Drinking Water Creation">
</center>
<p>
Water is delivered from a groundwater or surface water source to a treatment plant, where it is first aerated to allow volatile gases to escape. Next, small particles are clumped together through the use of coagulating agents and allowed to settle out of the water. Particles that do not settle out through coagulation slowly filter out to the bottom of a maze-like settling tank in a process known as sedimentation. The material at the bottom, called sludge, often creates a disposal problem, since it may contain some toxic elements (see <I>Waste </I>section). Next, water flows through long horizontal tanks with filters made of gravel, sand, or granulated activated carbon and is collected at the bottom of these filters. Filtration removes additional particles and bacteria. Finally, chlorination kills any remaining microbes. All large public water systems are required to monitor for chemicals, which can form when chlorine reacts with solid matter and other constituents in the water. They must also monitor for organics, inorganics, fecal coliform and other constituents.

<A NAME="RESULTS">RESULTS OF TESTING IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
In Texas, naturally-occurring high levels of fluoride and arsenic, combined with contaminants from human activities, have caused hundreds of public water systems to exceed the state's maximum contaminant levels. Between 1988 and 1993, 179 public water systems exceeded national and state maximum contaminant levels for organic and inorganic substances.
<P>
Naturally-occurring contaminants found in public water supply systems in Texas include nitrates in the central Texas area, arsenic along the Gulf Coast and high selenium levels scattered throughout the state. As discussed previously, the nitrates are of special concern from a public health standpoint. In the Panhandle area, high nitrates in the water may be caused by agricultural activity throughout the High Plains. Nitrates also have exceeded state standards in some small drinking water systems in Concho, Ector, Gaines, Glasscock, Howard, Martin, Midland, Terry and Travis counties, most of which rely on groundwater. 
<P>
Since 1993, the federal government has required public drinking water systems to monitor for pesticides. No pesticides were found in Texas in 1993.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#107">(107)</A>

About 1.1 million people rely on private wells for their drinking water.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#108">(108)</A> Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, water supply systems for communities with less than 15 connections or 25 people are not regulated, meaning they do not have to meet federal and state monitoring and treatment standards. Those served by private wells must test waters themselves to determine if it is safe to drink, particularly to ascertain high levels of coliform bacteria and nitrates. There are a number of government-run laboratories - mainly local county health departments - around the state that can help citizens test their water.

Coastal waters - estuaries, wetlands and bays - are critical to the economy and ecology of Texas. Almost three-fourths of the fish harvested in the Gulf of Mexico are species that depend on estuaries and wetlands for mating and spawning.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#109">(109)</A> The estuaries themselves are home to more than 80 species of animals and plants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#110">(110)</A> Species that either live in or depend upon the estuaries include shrimp, oysters, crabs, bluecrabs and finfish. 
<P>
Thirty-two of Texas' 80 segments of estuarine waters are classified as shellfish waters. (A "segment" is a unit designated by the state for purposes of monitoring bodies of water. For estuaries, a segment is usually a seven-mile stretch of coastline.) About one million sport fishermen and 20,000 commercial fishermen catch more than 100 million pounds of coastal fish and shellfish each year in Texas' coastal waters, contributing an estimated $2.9 billion to the state's economy.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#111">(111)</A> These habitats also attract hunters, photographers, swimmers, campers, bird-watchers, boaters and sightseers, generating an additional $3 billion dollars per year.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#112">(112)</A>
<P>
As more people move into the coastal area, fragile habitat is being lost. More than one-third of the state's population now lives and works within 100 miles of the coast. Twenty percent of the state's population lives in the four-county area surrounding Galveston Bay -  Galveston, Chambers, Brazoria, and Harris counties. The Texas General Land Office estimates that by the year 2000 more than 5.3 million people will live in the coastal areas.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#113">(113)</A> Along with population growth will come increased development and demands for water and wastewater facilities, and potential threats of pollution to estuaries, wetlands and bays.

<A NAME="STATE">STATE EFFORTS TO PROTECT COASTAL WATERS</A>
</H4>
The Texas General Land Office (GLO) has primary responsibility for managing the habitats and waters of the Texas coastal region. In 1987, the General Land Office and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department agreed to set up a series of coastal preserves to help protect the estuaries. In 1988, the South Bay and Welder Flats preserves were established, followed in 1991 by the Christmas Bay preserve and the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge. State and federal coastal preserves, including South Padre Island, are discussed further in the <I>Land </I>section. 
<P>
In 1991, the Texas Legislature directed the General Land Office to head up a new Coastal Coordination Council, which has since developed a Coastal Zone Management Plan with other state agencies. The Plan may become effective in 1995. The Management Plan sets policies, standards and regulations affecting private and public property in all counties contiguous to the Texas coastline. It can impact such activities as development permits, fill-and-dredge operations, siting of oil and gas waste-disposal pits, agricultural activities and highway construction. 
<P><H4>
<A NAME="ESTUARIES">ESTUARIES</A>
</H4>
Estuaries and bays are threatened by a variety of pollution sources and are among Texas' most endangered waters. Some 80 square miles of Texas' bays have been affected by toxic pollution.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#114">(114)</A> Nearly <BR>
40 percent of open bays - 762.9 of 1,991.7 square miles - do not fully meet their designated uses under the state's water quality standards.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#115">(115)</A> These uses include swimming, shellfish harvesting and recreational fishing. 
<P>
Most of these water quality problems are related to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in Texas' shellfish harvesting areas. In 1993, the Texas Department of Health closed or restricted 625.3 miles of Texas coast to oyster harvesting due to high fecal coliform levels.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#116">(116)</A> In addition, parts of Lavaca Bay are closed to finfish and blue crab harvesting because of mercury contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#117">(117)</A>

	<LI><B>Upstream water use.</B> Diversion of water from rivers decreases estuary inflow. New surface water use permits sometimes require that a portion of fresh water be set aside to protect the inflow needs of estuaries.

Instead, estuaries must often rely on return flows from wastewater treatment plants as their inflow from some river basins.

<A NAME="NATIONAL">THE NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAMS</A>
</H4>
Under the 1987 Clean Water Act, states can recommend to the Environmental Protection Agency that estuaries be included in the National Estuary Program. In Texas, both Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi Bay have been designated as national estuaries, making them eligible for federal and state funds to develop comprehensive management plans. The designation of the 560-square-mile Galveston Bay Estuarine System is particularly significant, since more than 60 percent of the wastewater produced in Texas eventually flows into Galveston Bay.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#120">(120)</A> 
<P>
As part of the program, a five-year assessment study of Galveston Bay preceeded the development of a management plan that addressed water quality, habitat, wildlife and human health aspects of the estuary. A draft plan, known as the Galveston Bay Plan, was released by the Galveston Bay National Estuary Program in 1994. In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency approved the Galveston Bay National Estuary Program. 
<P>
The estimated cost to the state for implementing the recommendations in the Galveston Bay Plan is $1.5 million per year in 1996 and 1997. Among the initiatives outlined in the Galveston Bay Plan are projects to: 
<UL><DL><DT></DL><LI>Reduce ambient toxicity by identifying and correcting violations of water quality standards for toxics;

<A NAME="WETLANDS">WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Wetlands furnish essential habitat for many species of waterfowl, mammals, fish and other wildlife. Wetlands can be located either near the coast (coastal wetlands) or further inland (interior wetlands). Texas' 2,575 million square acres of coastal wetlands act as a natural filter for various natural and man-made contaminants, protecting the overall estuarine system. 
<P>
Wetlands are defined in state law as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Coastal wetlands include salt and fresh marshes, tidal inlands and forested scrub. 
<P>
Coastal wetlands are imperative for maintaining coastal water quality in Texas because they help filter out pollutants and because they help control excessive runoff to the bays. They also provide important nutrients for the bay ecosystem. In 1991, wetlands were recognized for the first time as "waters of the state" under Texas Water Quality Standards and are now afforded better water quality protection. Also, in 1991, the State Legislature adopted a no net loss of state-owned wetlands policy for the state of Texas. This policy has led the state Parks and Wildlife Department to develop a wetlands management plan, which other state agencies are directed to uphold to protect wetlands from destruction (see <I>Wildlife</I> chapter for details). 
<P>
<A NAME="THREATS"><B>Threats to Wetlands</A></B>
<P>
Like estuaries, wetlands are subject to a variety of threats. In 1956, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that Texas had 937,400 acres of coastal wetlands. In 1980, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department estimated there were 611,760 acres, a 35 percent decrease in less than 25 years. And saltwater intrusion caused by canals, land subsidence (sinking) and drainage ditches has severely damaged some remaining wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#122">(122)</A> Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure precisely the number of acres of wetlands in Texas, in part because the last large-scale inventory of coastal wetlands in Texas was in 1979. In addition, wetlands are difficult to survey because their appearance changes drastically with drought or flood conditions. 
<P>
Subsidence of land along the coast and the loss of coastline caused by soil erosion and a rising sea level have contributed to the loss of coastal wetlands. Each year, 225 acres of Gulf shoreline wash into the sea. An estimated 21,000 acres of shoreline were lost between the mid 1800s and 1982.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#123">(123)</A> In some areas of Texas, overpumping of groundwater has led to the subsidence, or sinking, of the land. This impact alone has led to the loss of about 24,600 acres of marshes existing since the 1950s in the four-county Galveston Bay area.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#124">(124)</A> 
<P>
Another significant cause of coastal wetlands loss is conversion of wetlands for development. Wetlands are sometimes drained and turned into rangeland or cropland or fitted for urban use. They are sometimes impacted by dredging and filling operations, conducted mainly to widen canals for navigation purposes, because dredged soil is often deposited in the wetlands' open water sites. 
<P>
One dramatic example of wetlands destruction resulting from land-use changes has been the loss of shoal grass in the Lower Laguna Madre. Over the past 20 years, there has been a 60 percent reduction in shoal grass beds in this wetland. Studies attribute the loss of sea grasses to suspension of fine particle sediment caused in part by the dredging of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#125">(125)</A> 
<P>
<A NAME="PROTECTION"><B>Wetlands Protection</A></B>
<P>
With the Clean Water Act of 1977 the federal government initiated the first truly comprehensive wetland protection program. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires the Army Corps of Engineers to issue a permit for any dredging or filling of waters of the United States. In 1986, this provision was expanded to include wetlands and water serving as habitat for migratory birds or endangered species. Normal farming, forestry and ranching activities are exempt from permit requirements. 
<P>
Though the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers actually issues the Section 404 Permits, applicants must also obtain certification from the state that a permit will not violate state water quality standards under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Of the 1,519 permits issued in 1993 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 733, or almost half, were found in the 18 counties along the Texas coast.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#126">(126)</A>

<A NAME="GULF">THE GULF OF MEXICO</A>
</H4>
The Gulf of Mexico is a recreational and economic resource for Texas, for other states that share its shoreline and for Mexico. Hazardous and industrial waste spills, illegal and legal dumping of garbage and off-shore drilling by oil and gas refineries have all led to widespread pollution of both the Gulf and Texas beaches. Pollution is also likely responsible for a 3,000-square-mile "dead zone " off the Texas-Louisiana coast, where no aquatic life lives or spawns. 
<P>
<A NAME="SPILLS"><B>Ocean Spills</A></B>
<P>
More than 102,000 vessels cart some 250 million tons of cargo to Texas' largest ports each year, about 45 percent of which is petroleum and oil-related.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#127">(127)</A> Spills and dumping from these ships during transit are among the chief causes of both marine and beach debris. Off-shore oil rigs and other petroleum-industry activity result in the discharging of chemicals and oil into Texas coastal waters, further degrading their quality. 
<P>
About a quarter of the nation's refining capacity and almost 65 percent of its petrochemical capacity are located along 367 miles of Texas shoreline. This concentration of industry means that the Gulf of Mexico serves as a major shipping route for the transport of petroleum products. In 1989, more than 115,000 tanker and barge transports carried some 1.6 billion barrels of crude oil, fuels and other petroleum products across Texas Gulf waters.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#128">(128)</A> 
<P>
The concentration of petrochemical industry also means that the Gulf is a likely site for oil spills. In the summer of 1990, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg exploded, discharging 4.6 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf. A collision between a tanker and tank-barge in August, 1990, caused some 700,000 gallons of oil to spill into Galveston Bay, blocking the Houston Ship Channel for days.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#129">(129)</A> 
<P>
In response to these spills, the Texas Legislature in 1991 passed the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act. The Act put the General Land Office in charge of oil spills and established a clean-up fund, generated by a two-cent-per-barrel fee on all crude oil being loaded or unloaded in Texas ports, to clean up "mystery spills" for which no responsible party can be identified. 
<P>
Between 1991 and 1993, there were more than 3,000 individual oil spills in coastal waters, about 25 percent of which were classified as mystery spills. These and other spills caused the fund to be used 45 times in 1992 and 1993, for a total expenditure of approximately $150,000. Of this amount, $70,000 was later recovered by locating responsible parties.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#130">(130)</A> 
<P>
The state of Texas holds title to 4 million acres of submerged land off the coast, which can be leased for oil and gas activity. In 1993, 11 rigs were operating in state waters offshore, two were operating in inshore waters, and another 227 on state land.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#131">(131)</A> Oil and gas production on federal waters is managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The central and western Gulf off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana have one of the highest oil and gas activities in the world.

<p>
<A NAME="DUMPING"><B>Ocean Dumping</A></B>
<P>
Improperly disposed of waste in Gulf waters is a major threat to marine mammals, birds and other aquatic life. Waste materials thrown off of garbage ships often entangle, maim and kill these aquatic creatures. Fish and marine mammals often eat synthetic materials, which then enters the food chain. Finally, this debris accumulates on the Texas coast, affecting both tourism and estuarine habitats. See the<I> Public Lands</I> chapter for a further discussion of beach debris.
<P>
To address this beach debris problem, the Gulf of Mexico has been earmarked as a special area under the international MARPOL treaty, which regulates marine pollution around the world. Under the treaty, the dumping of solid waste by any boat from any nation would be prohibited in a special area. The designation of "special areas," however, will not take effect until all countries sharing the Gulf have constructed special port garbage reception facilities.

	<P><LI><P><A NAME="58">The </A>ordinance in Austin, known as the Save Our Springs (SOS), was passed by voters in 1992. There is considerable opposition to the SOS ordinance, however. Opponents predicted that the ordinance in Austin would curtail economic development by burdening businesses wanting to develop within the watershed and recharge zones. They argued instead that limits on development should be linked to technical pollution-control equipment and to the actual pollution caused by development, not to the amount of impervious cover. The SOS ordinance is currently being challenged in a number of court cases throughout the Austin area. In addition, legislation introduced in the Texas Legislature may abolish the applicability of both the SOS and San Antonio ordinance outside city corporate limits.

	<P><LI><P><A NAME="58">The </A>ordinance in Austin, known as the Save Our Springs (SOS), was passed by voters in 1992. There is considerable opposition to the SOS ordinance, however. Opponents predicted that the ordinance in Austin would curtail economic development by burdening businesses wanting to develop within the watershed and recharge zones. They argued instead that limits on development should be linked to technical pollution-control equipment and to the actual pollution caused by development, not to the amount of impervious cover. The SOS ordinance is currently being challenged in a number of court cases throughout the Austin area. In addition, legislation introduced in the Texas Legislature may abolish the applicability of both the SOS and San Antonio ordinance outside city corporate limits.

<H4><A NAME="USES">WHO USES PARKS</A> 
</H4>
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, in 1993 state parks served 25 million visitors.
<P>
A 1991 federal study revealed that, of the 6.5 million Texas residents 16 years and older engaged in wildlife-associated recreation, 2.6 million participated in fishing and 1 million in hunting activities, and 3.8 million in non-consumptive activities such as observing, feeding or photographing wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#15">(15)</A> (These figures total more than 6.5 million because some people participated in multiple activities.)
<P>
Results of a 1993 statewide citizen survey conducted by Texas A&amp;M of 2,688 Texans selected randomly from those holding a current Texas driver license showed that respondents' four most important non-community-based recreation activities were camping, fishing, swimming and hiking. The development of campsites and natural area parks were cited much more frequently than other recreational facilities as being most needed at the state level. 
<P>
Respondents stated that for local communities, the most needed facilities were bike trails, walking/jogging trails and nature trails. The need for trails was rated substantially higher than for other community-based recreational facilities.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#16">(16)</A> 

<P>
In a 1994 survey of recreation and park professionals and citizen groups, conserving natural resources for recreational use and meeting recreational open space needs were listed as two of the top four priorities that should be addressed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. (In this context, recreational use referred to passive recreation, such as wildlife observation, walking, hiking or picnicking.) The other priorities were financing new parks and recreational space and maintaining and renovating existing parks and recreation facilities.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#17">(17)</A>

<H4><A NAME="POLLUTION">PARK POLLUTION</A> 
</H4><P>
Texas public lands are not immune to air, land and water pollution. Protecting parks from pollution and urban development is a concern of the National Park Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#18">(18)</A> For instance, the U.S. Park Service believes that the rapid decline of visibility at Big Bend National Park is mainly due to air pollution from northeastern Mexico, including the coal-burning plant located 120 miles southeast of the park. Big Bend is considered to suffer the most visibility degradation of any site in the National Park System.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#19">(19)</A>
<P>
The Franklin Mountains in El Paso suffer from serious air pollution, and for years McKinney Falls located outside the city of Austin was closed due to leaking sewer lines from a municipal waste treatment facility.

<H4><A NAME="FUTURE">FUTURE ACQUISITIONS</A>
</H4><P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department can establish parks and protected areas without legislation or a decree from the Governor. Protected area acquisitions are initiated by the TPWD staff, based on a priority list and approved by the Department's nine member commission. During the last few years Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been adding to existing parks rather than establishing new parks. TPWD's 1995-1999 Strategic Plan notes that there is a $265 million dollar unfunded need for land acquisition. 
<P>
According to the National Park Service, there are no pending Congressional actions to designate new national parkland in Texas. The National Park Service does plan to purchase approximately 48,000 private acres that are currently within the existing boundaries of designated national parks in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#20">(20)</A> 
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) plans to acquire at least 50,000 acres of habitat for national wildlife refuges along the Lower Rio Grande Valley and additional coastal wetlands and bottomland hardwoods along East Texas rivers.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#21">(21)</A> (See Biodiversity section for listing of USFWS future acquisitions.)
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service hopes that a Congressional allocation will allow the Forest Service to purchase 10,000 to 14,000 in additional acreage in Texas within the Forest Service's existing boundaries, but there is no indication that a new national forest will be designated in Texas in the near future.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
Local city councils and commissioners courts decide whether to purchase parkland at the local level, but often voters must approve bonds for funds to purchase the land and operate the parks.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="PUBLIC">PUBLIC/PRIVATE CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES</A>
</H4><P>
Through the efforts of conservation groups across the country, Congress enacted legislation in 1989 that required the Resolution Trust Corporation to identify significant properties held as a result of failed savings and loan institutions.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#23">(23)</A> Significant properties include wetlands, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, properties with historic structures, or of archaeological or scientific value. Once these properties were identified, RTC was required to notify conservation and preservation buyers of the existence of these properties and provide them with a period of time to bid on the land.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#24">(24)</A> 
<P>
Texans have benefited from this legislation: 4,700 acres of endangered species habitat in San Antonio owned by the RTC were bought for parkland through the combined efforts of the Trust for Public Land, the San Antonio Water System, the Edwards Underground Water District and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The FDIC has authorized the sale of Playa del Rio, a 12,500 acre wetland and wildlife haven at the mouth of the Rio Grande River, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The cities of Austin, Arlington, Fort Worth, Whitehouse, Cedar Hill, Rowlett, Corpus Christi and Dallas have all purchased parkland from the RTC.
<P>
The Texas Nature Conservancy, a state affiliate of The Nature Conservancy, a national, not-for-profit organization that helps preserve significant natural areas, has been working in Texas since 1966. The Conservancy identifies acreage that needs to be protected and then preserves the land through gift, lease, trade or purchase. The Conservancy acts as the manager of natural areas or provides protection until an appropriate agency takes over the maintenance and care. As of January 1993, the Texas Nature Conservancy had 22,000 members and had acquired more than 281,000 acres of land. 
<P>
Also active in Texas is the Trust for Public Land, a national not-for-profit organization that helps communities acquire land for parks, community gardens, recreation areas and wilderness lands. The Trust has helped protect 13,415 acres in Texas, including Barton Creek Wilderness Park in Austin, Government Canyon in San Antonio, parkland in Dallas County and a wildlife refuge in Angelina County. In 12 cities across the country, including Austin, Texas, the Trust is testing the theory that juvenile crime drops when cities provide parks and recreational facilities.
<P>
<A NAME="WISE">*</A><CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>"WISE USE" MOVEMENT</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Since 1988, a loose coalition of organizations, known as the "Wise Use" coalition, has been lobbying for changes in public lands policies. For example, this coalition wants to increase permissible activities on public lands, such as logging old-growth forests. The coalition wants to open national parks to mining and oil drilling. They also advocate barring the government from acquiring any additional private land for parks or wildlife habitat.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#25">(25)</A>  
<P>
Though the "wise use" coalition seems to have originated in the northwestern United States, some of its sentiments are expressed in the 1994 Texas Republican Party state platform: "Property Ownership and Groundwater Rights - The Party understands that government ownership of land is an ideal of socialism. We affirm our belief in the fundamental constitutional concept of a person's right to own property without government interference. We decry the vast acquisition of Texas land by conservancy groups and government agencies. We call on our State Legislators to reclaim lands under federal control and return them to the people of Texas. We also affirm that groundwater is an 'absolute ownership' right of the landowner."<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#26">(26)</A>

<H4><A NAME="SENATE">SENATE BILL 179: TOO LITTLE TO SERVE TOO MANY</A>.
</H4><P>
In 1993, the 73rd Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 179, requiring the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to establish a classification system for the state park system and to expand opportunities for "recreational hunting," when appropriate, on Department lands. Prior to SB 179, state law allowed hunting in state parks, natural areas, wildlife management areas and other lands only as a biological tool to solve wildlife over-population problems. With SB 179, the state has shifted its position to one that allows hunting unless the Texas Parks and Wildlife shows that it will damage natural resources. The Sierra Club and Audubon Society opposed SB 179, contending that it is reasonable to restrict some public lands for recreational use.

In 1993, prior to the enactment of SB 179, Texas hunters had access to more than 1 million acres of state public lands (controlled hunting on wildlife management acreage), 2 million acres of federal lands and 130 million acres of private lands.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#27">(27)</A>

The resources may be physical (e.g. fossil fuels), biological (e.g. tropical forest) or cul-tural (e.g. ancient monuments).

<H4><A NAME="GULF">GULF BEACHES</A>
</H4><P>
Texas beaches are among the most popular areas of the state. By the year 2000, 5.3 million people are projected to live in Texas coastal counties. Between 1970 and 1989, Texas ranked fifth in the nation in coastal hotel and recreational construction, and in that same period it was one of the ten leading states in coastal residential construction.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
The growing coastal population, increased recreational activities, and economic and land development on the Texas coast have placed additional pressures on the natural resources of the area.
<P>
Bills Related to Coastal Matters:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI> Senate Bill 1571, 1989. Designated the Texas General Land Office (GLO) as the lead agency to coordinate a long-range plan for the management of state-owned coastal lands. 
	<P>
	<LI> Senate Bill 1053, 1991. The Coastal Management Plan for Beach Access. Directed the General Land Office to formulate rules to address the issues of beach erosion, beach access and fees and development on public beaches.
	<P>
	<LI> Senate Bill 1054, 1991. The Coastal Management Plan for State-Owned Wetlands. Designated the Texas General Land Office to formulate a management plan for coastal wetlands.
</UL>
<P>Since 1990, as part of the process of developing a Texas Coastal Management Plan, the Texas General Land Office has held a series of public meetings. In public hearings held in coastal communities, residents identified public beach access, dune protection and shoreline erosion as three of the most critical issues that the Texas Coastal Management Program should address.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="BEACH">BEACH ACCESS AND BEACH DEBRIS</A>
</H4><P>
Since l958, with the enactment of the Texas Open Beaches Act, the public has been "guaranteed" the right of access and use of Texas beaches. Of the 367 miles of coastal beaches, 293 miles are open for public use. Of these 293 miles, only 173 miles are considered accessible to the public. Accessible is defined as "accessible by driving along the shore or by walking no more than one mile from a point that can be reached by a two-wheel-drive vehicle."<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#29">(29)</A>  Public access to beaches varies greatly from one end of the coast to the other. Some communities provide more public entrances than others, and in some areas residential and commercial development prevent easy access to the shoreline. Natural resource planners must consider that increased beach access may also increase the public use of beaches and, in turn, adversely effect dunes and other natural resources.
<P>
Recreational users of Texas beaches encounter literally hundreds of thousands of pounds of trash. During the 1992 National Coastal Cleanup, a volunteer program sponsored by the Texas General Land Office, 175.5 tons of debris were collected on a 166 mile stretch of beaches, and during the 1993 cleanup 155.7 tons of garbage were removed. Since 1987, when the coastal cleanup began, 2,127 tons of trash have been removed from approximately 180 miles of beaches. According to the General Land Office, 70 percent of the garbage found on our coastal beaches is dumped from ships traveling the Gulf of Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#30">(30)</A>

<H4><A NAME="DUNE">DUNE LOSS AND PROTECTION</A>
</H4><P>
The Coastal Management Plan required coastal counties and municipalities to develop dune-protection and beach access plans and submit them to the General Land Office by August 1993. Coastal dunes serve several valuable functions: 1) protecting inland areas from storms and flooding; 2) holding sand that can replenish that lost to erosion; and 3) serving as habitat to wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#31">(31)</A> Because there have been no base-line studies, the extent of dune loss over time is unknown.  
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SHORELINE">GULF SHORELINE LOSS</A> 
</H4><P>
More than 27,000 acres of Gulf shoreline were lost to erosion from the mid-1800s to 1982.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#32">(32)</A> Coastal erosion can damage or destroy both private and public property, damage the economies of our coastal communities and devastate Texas beaches. At least 100 acres of beach front and 300 acres of bay front are lost annually, and 60 percent of the Texas shoreline is vulnerable to erosion.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#33">(33)</A> According to studies, two-thirds of Texas' bay shores are eroding at rates of two to nine feet per year.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#34">(34)</A> Erosion rates do vary. For example, shoreline changes of nearly 13 feet/year occur at Packery Channel on North Padre Island and up to seven feet/year at South Padre Island.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#35">(35)</A> The average long term rate is about 225 acres per year.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#36">(36)</A> As the lead agency for coastal matters, the Texas General Land Office was designated by the 72nd Legislature to develop a coastwide erosion avoidance and remediation plan relying on public participation. Once completed, the plan will be sent to the Legislature for approval.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="INTERNATIONAL">INTERNATIONAL LAW AND OCEAN TRASH: WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND</A>
</H4><P>
The MARPOL Treaty, an international agreement that regulates marine pollution around the world, contains five annexes, each of which regulates a type of pollution. Annex V has regulations for the prevention of pollution by garbage and specifically prohibits the dumping of plastics in the world's oceans. The Wider Caribbean Region (which includes the Gulf of Mexico) has been designated by the International Maritime Organization as a "special area," where dumping from ships except for food scraps is prohibited. This "Special Area" designation was to go into effect in April 1993; however, enforcement of the "Special Area" rules cannot begin until there are adequate garbage reception facilities at each port. The United States and, in particular, Texas have adequate port garbage facilities in place.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#37">(37)</A> But ports of other countries do not. Eighteen countries have agreed to the "Special Area" designation, including Mexico, Cuba, Grenada, Guatemala, Panama, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and other countries on the Caribbean.

<H4><A NAME="RIVERS">TEXAS RIVERS AND PUBLIC ACCESS</A>
</H4><P>
Texas has 191,228 miles of streams and rivers; 11,247 rivers and streams are large enough to have been named. In a 1986 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department citizen survey, 67 percent of the respondents agreed that "more public recreation areas are needed along rivers and streams." <A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#38">(38)</A>
<P>
Texas law has long recognized the public's right to use navigable streams for canoeing, swimming, and fishing. Unlike the coastal beaches, however, no state agency has day-to-day responsibility for protecting or securing the public's right of access to rivers. Under a Texas law dating from 1837, a river is considered navigable (and therefore open to public use) as long as its bed averages at least 30 feet wide from its mouth up.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#39">(39)</A> There are hundreds of streams which meet this navigability test. However, no state agency has undertaken the task of identifying all these navigable streams. Because of limited budgets and the need for field investigations, state agencies have been reluctant to respond to public inquiries about the navigability of streams. Even for the major rivers known to be navigable, such as the Brazos, Trinity, Colorado, and Guadalupe, public access is limited. Under state law, the right of access to lakes, streams and rivers rests with the owners of the land that borders on the surface water. In Texas, the majority of this "riparian" land is in private hands. Therefore, the public is dependent upon public parks and boat ramps or highway rights-of-way as their only means of river access. Texas citizens have expressed concern about the lack of public accessways.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#40">(40)</A> (See the <I>Water </I>Chapter for a discussion of pollution of Texas rivers.)

<H4><A NAME="MOVEMENT">THE NATIONAL FORESTS MOVEMENT</A>
</H4><P>
In the United States, public concern for the protection and use of national forests and forest practices dates back to at least the mid-1800s, when conservationists made public their alarm at the destruction of the giant redwood groves in California. Residents of the Midwest were simultaneously concerned with the denuded lands around the Great Lakes and the resulting erosion problems. The concerns of the early conservationists are still concerns today. Above all, many fear that the wholesale destruction of old growth forests would result in destruction of biological diversity, local climatic changes, soil erosion, disruption of wildlife and water flow.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#41">(41)</A>
<P>
Significant Federal Forest Legislation:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1875, the Division of Forestry under the U. S. Department of Agriculture was created to report to Congress on forest production and consumption. 
	
	<LI>In 1891, the misuse and loss of forest lands persuaded President Benjamin Harrison to create 6 forest reserves, totalling 3 million acres, and 9 timber reserves totalling 13 million acres. 
</UL>
<P>
To the disappointment of many conservationists, a federal law passed in 1897 granted the Secretary of Interior the authority to allow for timber harvesting and mining within national forests. This Act in turn paved the way for "the multiple-use policy" - lands managed for a variety of uses including recreation, timber and mineral production, and wildlife habitat - that continues to govern the use of our national forests and parkland.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#42">(42)</A>
<P>
It was not until 1964 that Congress, after acrimonious debates, passed the Wilderness Act, requiring that some national forest land be preserved in its natural state and prohibiting timber sales and other commodity uses in these areas.

<H4>OWNERSHIP OF FORESTS IN TEXAS</H4>
<IMG SRC="c.owner.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Pie chart of forest ownership in Texas">
<p>
There are 22,032,000 acres of forests in Texas. The first and last state forest purchased was in 1920; the most recent was obtained through a donation in 1984.
<P>
<i>Source: The Texas Forest Service and the Texas Almanac 1994-1995.Dallas Congressman John Bryant has introduced a bill, the Forest Biodiversity and Clearcutting Prohibition Act, to end even-aged management in national forests and to require that the native mixture of tree species be maintained. If passed, the legislation would affect only national forests. Of the 733 million acres of forests in the U.S., 191 million acres are managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Of the 22,032,000 acres of forests in Texas, only 675,232 acres are in national forests. The remaining acres are in private hands.</I>
<P>

<H4><A NAME="MULTIPLE">MULTIPLE USE OF NATIONAL FORESTS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4><P>
As a result of the multiple-use management concept, national forests in Texas are open to timber production, grazing, oil and gas leases and recreational uses. It is estimated that 521,000 out of 637,000 acres of national forest in Texas are suitable for timber production on a sustained-yield basis (reforestation after cutting).<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#43">(43)</A> From national forest production, Texas manufacturers produce such items as lumber, plywood, poles, furniture, pulp and paper. 
<P>
In 1993, a total of $12,639,412 was received from timber sales in National Forests in Texas. One quarter of the timber sale revenues are returned to the states. As a result, in 1993, 12 Texas counties, where national forests are located, shared approximately $3.6 in revenues. Approximately 83 percent of the revenue collected by the Forest Service in Texas was generated by timber sales.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#44">(44)</A>
<P>
According to the U.S. Forest Service, a proposed rule to guide land and resource management planning for the 191 million-acre National Forest System shows a shift in thinking toward an ecosystem approach to resource management. "The fundamental premise is that the principle goal of managing the National Forest System is to maintain or restore the sustainability of ecosystems and that this is essential because sustained yield of benefits for present and future generations is more likely to occur when the ecosystems from which those benefits are produced are in a sustainable condition."<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#45">(45)</A>

Through a survey done for Texas Outdoor Recreation Plan of 1990, Texans expressed concern that the national forests in Texas were being managed primarily for timber harvest and requested that the "U.S. Forest Service assess more fully benefits of outdoor recreation so it more adequately competes with other forest activities under the multiple-use management concept." <A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#46">(46)</A> The U.S. Forest Service conducted a revision of its forest plan to address this and other forest management issues. The revised Plan is scheduled to be approved by October 1995.

<H4><A NAME="CLEARCUTTING">CLEARCUTTING</A>
</H4><P>
Some Texas environmental organizations have been concerned with the Forest Service practice of "clearcutting" - the felling of all trees in a group in one operation - national forest lands and converting the native mixed forests to single-species, even-age timber crops.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#47">(47)</A>  Clearcutting, one form of even-age management, often results in 1) the elimination of the native forest ecosystem, causing a vastly reduced habitat for wildlife; 2) increased erosion, with attendant stream siltation and nutrient loss from the soil; 3) impairment of recreational values; and 4) increased susceptibility of the forest to insect damage, diseases, acid rain and blowdown of trees.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#48">(48)</A> 
<P>
An alternative to clearcutting is a process called selection management. Under selection management, individual trees are marked and cut, creating small clearings for regeneration--with natural reseeding from remaining trees. Authorities believe that the benefits to wildlife, soils and recreation of shifting from even-age management to selection management would be enormous. The shift would also be economically beneficial. A Forest Service study in Arkansas concluded that selection management is more cost-effective and has a higher benefit-to-cost ratio than even-age management.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#49">(49)</A>  
<P>
In 1985, the Texas Committee on Natural Resources, a statewide not-for-profit environmental organization, joined by the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society, brought suit against the Forest Service regarding the effects of even-age management on the endangered Red-Cockaded Woodpecker. The Court ruled in 1988 that the Forest Service could conduct no even-age timber sales within 1,200 meters of Red-Cockaded Woodpecker colonies on national forests in Texas. In continuing litigation, the Court is considering the on-the-ground impacts of even-age management on forest ecosystems in general.
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service draft revised Forest Plan calls for an overall reduction of clearcutting and site specific clearcutting.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#50">(50)</A>  
<P>
<H4><A NAME="TIMBER">TIMBER PRODUCTION AND TEXAS FORESTS</A>
</H4><P>
Timber ranks among Texas' top four agricultural crops in terms of value, and the $6 billion wood-based industry is one of the top ten manufacturing sectors in the state.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#51">(51)</A>
<P>
In recent years there has been an increase in timber harvesting, sales and the costs of lumber. Since 1991, harvesting in Texas has increased on private lands by 6 percent. The price of timber has doubled in the last ten years. Eighty-one million board feet of timber from the National Forests in Texas was produced in fiscal year 1993.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#52">(52)</A> Eighty-five percent of the timber harvested in Texas is pine; from 1986-1992 more softwood was harvested than was being planted. According to the Texas Forest Service, in addition to increased demand, industries that have formerly relied on timber logging in the Northwest have moved to the South, leading to the expansion of the Texas timber industry.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#53">(53)</A>
<P>
The Texas Forest Service and the timber industry are concerned that, over the long term, if demand continues, the timber inventory will decline faster than it can be replaced.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#54">(54)</A> According to the Texas Forest Service, if timber removals exceed growth at a high rate over the long run, "either growth must be increased, or removals decreased, in order to maintain a sustainable supply of softwood timber [pine] to support the region's largest industry."<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
According to the Texas Forest Service, for the timber industry to keep up with demand, reforestation on nonindustrial private lands offers the greatest opportunity to enhance timber growth in Texas. On the other hand, forest experts and biologists are concerned that increased demands for wood products will turn natural forests of East and East-Central Texas into rows of man-made pine plantation monocultures, altering the ecosystem of the entire region. (A discussion of bottomland hardwood loss is found in the section on wildlife habitat.)

The Environmental Defense Fund estimates that a million acres were lost this way in the Southeast between 1975 and 1985, or about 100,000 acres per year, and those same losses continue today. On February 7, 1994, as a result of a suit brought by the Environmental Defense Fund, the Environmental Protection Agency banned the clearing and draining of wetlands to make pine plantations for timber companies.

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> The chemical dioxin - a by-product of chlorine chemistry - is a waste product of many industrial operations, including the manufacture of bleached pulp and paper. Recent studies by EPA indicate human and animal exposure to dioxin (and dioxin-like chemicals) have more powerful adverse health effects than once thought. Humans are exposed to dioxin from food that has been contaminated with dioxin entering the food chain, particularly meat and dairy products. Animals acquire it from the water and air. Some companies in the paper industry have been implementing alternatives to the chlorine bleaching process. (Copies of EPA's Dioxin reports are available from the CERI/ORD Publications Center.

	<LI>East Texas has an estimated 2.4 million acres of artificially regenerated forest. Nearly three-quarters is land owned by the timber industry. Nonindustrial private landowners have established an additional half million acres of artificially regenerated forests.
	<P>
	<LI>Of the 500,000 acres a year harvested, 200,000 acres are harvested on land not owned by the timber industry.
	<P>
	<LI>Private non-industry landowners are replanting only one acre to every nine acres harvested.
	<P>
	<LI>The Forest Service reforests about 37,000 acres/year on private lands and believes the amount that should be reforested is 70,000 acres/year.

Dallas Congressman John Bryant has introduced a bill, the Forest Biodiversity and Clearcutting Prohibition Act, to end even-aged management in national forests and to require that the native mixture of tree species be maintained. If passed, the legislation would affect only national forests. Of the 733 million acres of forests in the U.S., 191 million acres are managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Of the 22,032,000 acres of forests in Texas, only 675,232 acres are in national forests. The remaining acres are in private hands.

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> According to the Texas Forest Service, timber rustlers are hauling off thousands of dollars worth of trees from private property in East Texas. In 1994 the Texas Forest Service received 60 complaints of thefts. The Service does not know the extent of the losses but points out that in Louisiana thieves haul off $12 million to $15 million in wood each year.

	Note: According to professional forester and historian, Douglas McCleery, the idea of "conservation as wise use" of natural resources began with conservation leader Gifford Pinochet in the late 19th and early 20th century. McLeery claims the original "wise use" movement was a product of the progressive era and included the concept of "multiple-use." The "multiple-use" and "wise use" concepts advocated by Pinochet reflected the view - today's predominant view, too - that nature's resources should be scientifically managed so as "to protect the basic productivity of the land and its ability to serve future generations."

<A NAME="HABITAT">WILDLIFE AND HABITAT PROTECTION LEGISLATION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has a legislative history of species and habitat protection. According to author Robin Doughty, due to over-hunting, the decline of deer, turkey and fur-bearing animals in Texas was noticeable by the 1830s and 40s.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#10">(10)</A> A decline in certain bird species was also documented at this time. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted game laws. Game laws are still prevalent today and are used to prevent the demise, or in some cases, to control the proliferation of specific species.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1860, the first game law in Texas provided closed season for the hunting of quail on Galveston Island; this act did not attempt to provide for wildlife protection statewide but was aimed at protecting the quail of Galveston Island, which were being over-hunted.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#11">(11)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>In 1879, Governor Oran M. Roberts created the first state institution for the conservation of animals. The State Fish Commissioner was appointed to improve the conditions of freshwater fish species and marine organisms that were being heavily exploited as a food resource and also were being affected by water pollution.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, under the Act to Preserve and Protect the Wild Game, Wild Birds and Wild Fowl, the state established a five-year closed season for the hunting of antelope, mountain sheep, and pheasants and ended commerce in wild animal meat, skins and plumage. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1907, a law authorized the new Game, Fish and Oyster Commissioner to sell hunting licenses to finance enforcement of game laws. (In 1910, however, the Texas Legislature appropriated the fund for other purposes and little enforcement took place.)
	<P>
	<LI>In 1925, a state law was passed to establish game preserves on privately held land.
	<P>
	<LI>In l973, The Texas Legislature enacted a state Endangered Species Act, which was amended in l981, 1985 and l987. The Act gave the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) the authority to establish a list of fish, wildlife and plants endangered or threatened with statewide extinction. Once listed, these species are afforded protection and are eligible for restoration efforts. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1983, The Texas Legislature established a Special Non-game and Endangered Species Fund to support non-game and endangered species research and management. The Fund receives money from fines, the sale of posters, stamps, and decals and from private donations. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shares a portion of the money it receives from the federal excise tax on hunting equipment with the states to support non-game and endangered species research and management.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1991, the 72nd Legislature adopted a bill adding wildlife management to the list of "agricultural uses" which qualified otherwise taxable open land for special appraisal valuation for property tax purposes. Though the Attorney General must still address some unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of this bill, essentially farmers who take land out of production and return it to a natural state for the purpose of wildlife management may be taxed according to the land's productivity value rather than its market value. In other words, the land retains its "agricultural use" property-tax status.

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In the state Endangered Species Act, there is no state criterion for protecting wildlife species from indirect take (e.g., destruction of habitat or unfavorable management practices).

Surveys conducted separately by Texas A&amp;M University and Rice University reflect Texans' strong concern for wildlife. A 1989 Texas A&amp;M survey revealed that 93 percent of Texans believe that endangered species should be protected.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#13">(13)</A> A Rice University poll conducted in December 1994 showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were willing to spend more tax monies to set aside and protect wilderness areas for endangered species in Texas; 37 percent were against spending more tax monies. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed agreed that "when humans change the natural environment, by building dams or clearing forests, it often can have disasterous results." Moreover, 64 percent of those interviewed agreed with the following view: "Some restrictions on property rights are justified to protect important aspects of the environment, such as wetlands or endangered species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#14">(14)</A>
<P>
A nationwide poll conducted in May 1994 found Americans surveyed supported setting aside more land for conservation and making landowners abide by rules to protect plants and animals. The poll indicated that 66 percent of those interviewed stated that they were more concerned with the environment than they had been a few years ago. Some 65 percent of those interviewed said more land should be set aside for conservation purposes.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#15">(15)</A>

<A NAME="FISH">FISH AND WILDLIFE CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Known for its ecological diversity, Texas is the home of 5,500 plant species, 425 of which only occur in Texas. Of 1,100 vertebrate species in Texas, 60 are found nowhere else in the world. With 540 bird species, Texas has more than any other state in the U.S.
<P>
As of December 1, 1993, the federal government listed 629 U.S. plant and animal species as endangered and 189 as threatened. Four hundred and ninety-five foreign only (not found in the United States) plant and animals species are endangered and 38 foreign only plant and animal species are threatened. In the future, it is expected that 3,000 species may need to be listed as endangered and threatened.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> There are 75 federally listed and proposed species in Texas: 27 plants; 48 birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians, arachnids and insects. There are 151 state listed species in Texas: 25 plants, 126 animals.

<P>
Extinction of animal species in Texas has increased dramatically since the turn of the century. Prior to 1900, three species were known to have disappeared. Between 1901-1958 four species are known to have disappeared. From 1959 to the present, ten species have disappeared. Of these 17 species, six are globally extinct. 
<P>
The extinction rate in Texas of plant species is difficult to ascertain. The survival of plant species has become a public concern only recently, and inventories are limited.
<P>
Texas has the third highest number of listed endangered and threatened species of any state. Florida and Hawaii are number one and number two. Besides those species currently listed as endangered and threatened, there is evidence to indicate that another 305 species in Texas are candidates for the endangered and threatened lists.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
According to the American Fisheries Society's endangered species committee, Texas is one of the most hazardous places in the United States for a fish species. The state has lost six species of fish - four since 1980.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#19">(19)</A>  In 1994, 29 fish species are listed as endangered or threatened. 
<P>
Interestingly, concern for the decline in freshwater fish species in the mid 1800s in Texas spurred the state's first conservation institution - the Fish Commissioner. Because the Fish Commissioner had limited resources and authority, however, the office did little to improve conditions for fish species. Instead, the Fish Commissioner attempted to compensate for the decline in native species by introducing European carp to Texas.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<P>
The Federal Endangered Species Act requires states to design a recovery program for each listed species. In Texas, the legislature delegated this responsibility to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The American alligator is the only endangered species on the Texas list that has ever been removed from the endangered list because of successful recovery activities.
<P>
Some of the methods used in recovery programs include research on the reproductive habits and ecology of rare species, examination of the taxonomic relationship of rare species to their environment and each other to determine appropriate survival and management strategies, assistance to landowners to improve wildlife habitat, and the purchase, where funds are available, of wildlife habitats. Texas Parks and Wildlife receives enough money to study only one in 10 endangered species.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
Though scientists understand the importance of habitat to the life of a species, they are just beginning to determine what constitutes livable space for a species. Biologists do know, however, that the loss of one species in an ecosystem can sometimes threaten the balance of the entire ecosystem and may cause its demise. For instance, Texas Parks and Wildlife speculates that the extirpation of the Black-footed Ferret may have contributed to problems managing prairie dog populations.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#23">(23)</A>

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the majority of calls reporting pollution and fish kills originate in areas of high urban and industrial development. This is due both to the increased pressure on the environment in these areas as well as the larger number of people who observe and report problems. The upper Texas coastal area (Houston-Port Arthur/Beaumont) normally has the highest number of incidents for each year. Other regions that have a significant number of reports are the regions that include Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the Corpus Christi area and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#24">(24)</A>

LOSS OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
<B>Springs and Spring Runs
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Due to their unique characteristics (constant temperature, clear water and in some cases isolation from connecting watercourses), these habitats are natural settings for many rare and unusual species. Status: A significant number of Texas springs have gone dry from man's activities. Over pumping of groundwater for irrigation and human use has led to lowering of groundwater tables and decreased or ceased spring discharge (the Edward's Aquifer is one example). Texas historically had 281 major springs. By 1973 only 2 of 4 very large and 17 
of 31 large springs were still flowing. Future: Increasing pressures on groundwater and aquifers will continue to impact existing springs, affecting associated flora and fauna.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Bottomland Hardwoods
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Texas' most diverse terrestrial habitat. An estimated 16 million acres of riparian (river/stream associated) habitat existed in early Texas. Status: More than 60 percent has been lost to agricultural conversion, timber production, urban/industrial development and reservoir construction. Future: Additional water development, new technologies in the use of hardwood pulp, and forestry practices threaten this habitat, especially in East Texas.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Coastal Wetlands</B>
</Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: The most important estuarine habitat since 90 percent of commercially and recreationally important species depend on these wetlands. One-third of all endangered species occur here and millions of waterfowl overwinter in this habitat. Status: Some 53 percent of all USA wetlands have been lost to dredge and fill for development, subsidence and agricultural conversion. Texas has lost more than 50 percent of its original 1.2 million acres. Thirty-five percent of losses have occurred since 1950. Almost half of Texas estuarine areas are closed, or conditionally closed, to shellfish harvest because of pollution. Future: Coastal development, loss of freshwater inflows and sea level rise threaten remaining wetlands.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>South Texas Brushlands
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: A unique habitat where more than 500 vertebrate species and more than 260 species of woody plants occur. Numerous endangered species including the ocelot and jaguarundi are found here. Status: Since the 1920s, more than 95 percent of the original brushlands have been converted to agricultural and urban use. Future: Restoration of brush and acquisition of remaining habitat is key to maintaining this unique ecosystem.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Texas Prairie
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: More than 20 million acres of tallgrass communities once covered the Texas Blacklands Prairie, the Fort Worth Prairie, the Feyette Prairie and the Coastal Prairie. Status: Of the 12.6 million acres of the Blacklands Prairie, fewer than 100,000 acres (less than 10 percent) of native sod exist today. A million acres of Coastal Prairie have been urbanized by Houston. Endangered species such as the Attwater's prairie chicken are on the edge of extinction because of such losses. Future: Continued losses to this habitat is expected. Restoration, cooperative actions and private landowners will be key to saving these prairie habitats.

<A NAME="LOSS">THE LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT 
</A></H4>
<P>
Today the overwhelming majority of losses of and threats to wildlife, plants and natural communities are a direct result of habitat alteration or destruction, caused by urbanization, timber production, reservoirs and agriculture.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#25">(25)</A> According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the following are examples of habitat loss in Texas: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>All but a fraction of the prairies of central and coastal Texas have been converted to farmland, and as a result the Attwater's Prairie Chicken is on the brink of extinction and Texas Prairie Dawn, a plant of the coastal prairies, is now rare.
	<P>
	<LI>River bottom hardwood forests in Texas have been reduced from 16 to six million acres and longleaf pine forests have nearly all been cut-over. As a result of these changes, Texas Trailing Phlox and many other plants are rare, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is gone from Texas, and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is threatened with the same fate.
	<P>
	<LI>The original grasslands of South Texas have been lost to brush invasion, the grassland-dependent Aplomado Falcon disappeared from Texas, the Slender Rush-Pea is endangered, and the South Texas Ambrosia has become rare.
	<P>
	<LI>Sub-tropical woodlands of the Rio Grande Valley have been converted to farmlands and citrus plantations, resulting in near-extinction of the Ocelot in Texas and increasing rarity for many plants, such as the Texas Ayenia.
	<P>
	<LI>Ground water pumping in West Texas and dam construction throughout the state have modified springs and rivers so that species such as the Amistad Gambusia and Phantom Shiner are extinct, and many other species, such as the Puzzle Sunflower, are rare.
	<P>
	<LI>* Urbanization and land clearing in the Texas hill country have destroyed and fragmented woodland habitat of the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler, along with several rare plants.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#26">(26)</A> 
</UL>
<P>
Another indication of ecological change is the documentation that marine and brackish fishes have invaded the lower Rio Grande basin as a result of high salinity, which in turn is forcing out freshwater fish.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Texas has 133 million acres of wildlife habitat remaining. This includes springs, bottomland hardwoods, coastal wetlands, south Texas brush lands, and Texas prairies. Ninety-seven percent of the land in Texas is privately held. Therefore, the continued existence of wildlife habitat is very much in the hands of the private sector. 
<P>
Wildlife habitat in Texas is broken into eight categories:<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI><B>Grasses</B>, 32 percent - herbs, grasses, forbs and grasslike plants are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Brush</B>, 20 percent - woody plants, most less than nine feet tall, are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Shrub</B>, 15 percent - individual wood plants generally less than nine feet tall and widely scattered throughout arid region
	<P>
	<LI><B>Parks</B>, 13 percent - home to woody plants mostly equal to or greater than nine feet tall, dominant and growing as clusters 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Forest</B>, 13 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees dominant; most taller than 30 feet with closed crowns
	<P>
	<LI><B>Woods</B>, 6 percent - woody plants mostly nine to 30 feet tall with closed crowns; midstory usually lacking
	<P>
	<LI><B>Swamps</B>, less than 1 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees with varying heights within inundated or almost inundated sites
	<P>
	<LI><B>Marsh</B>, less than 1 percent - emergent herbaceous plants dominant in inundated areas, woody vegetation lacking or nearly so.

Wetlands are defined "as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#29">(29)</A> Wetlands include marshes, swamps, bogs, and shallow lakes and can include floodplains and mudflats.
<P>
Among their many valuable functions, which include filtering pollutants and preventing erosion and flooding, wetlands are the breeding, feeding and nesting grounds for many endangered species and plants and for non-endangered wildlife and natural communities. 
<P>
In recognizing the tremendous importance of wetlands, the federal government established a national goal of "no overall net loss of wetlands." The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the law that has had the greatest impact upon wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for any dredging or filling into waters of the United States. This includes both terrestrial and coastal wetlands. 
<P>
In Texas in 1993, of the 1,510 Section 404 permits issued for dredging and filling wetlands, 733 were found in coastal areas. Only 20 to 30 inland permits are issued a year and those are usually for reservoirs that significantly affect wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#30">(30)</A> This does not indicate that inland wetlands are less threatened by human activities, however. The 404 permit process is discussed in the <I><A HREF="../QualityCh2p1.html">Water Quality</A></I> chapter.

<A NAME="PROTECT">PROTECTING WETLANDS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Though Texas has lost one-half of its coastal wetlands and 60 percent of its terrestrial wetlands in the last 200 years, there is no state law to protect wetlands. In the coastal management legislation of 1991, Texas legislators did incorporate a no-net-loss of wetlands <I>policy </I>for <I>state-owned </I>land. Though this is a positive step, the majority of wetlands are on private lands. 
<P>
Three state agencies have significant roles in wetland protection: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas General Land Office. Among federal agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have significant responsibility for wetland protection. 
<P>
There are two major types of wetlands in Texas: inland/terrestrial wetlands and Coastal wetlands. Inland wetlands include bottomland hardwood forests in East Texas and riparian vegetation and playa lakes (shallow lakes) in West Texas. A discussion of coastal wetlands, including salt and freshwater marshes, is found in the section on water resources. 
<P>
Interior wetlands account for 80 percent of the total wetland acreage in Texas. Texas has lost 60 percent of its most valuable inland wetlands: the riparian communities.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#31">(31)</A> Most of the inland wetlands are on privately held properties. 
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been assigned as the lead agency to develop a state wetlands conservation plan. Though the plan will be statewide in scope, it will focus on inland wetlands, since the Texas General Land Office is developing a coastal wetlands plan. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, conserving wetlands will depend on acquisition, cooperative agreements, education and technical assistance.

<A NAME="BOTTOM">BOTTOMLAND FORESTED WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Bottomland hardwood systems are the most diverse Texas ecosystems. Bottomland wetlands are plant communities that have been created as a result of the actions of creeks, rivers and flood plains. The bottomland hardwood forest is a part of a system that starts at a river's headwaters and ends in an estuary at the ocean. Trees found in the bottom-land hardwood forests include bald cypress, pecan, oaks, elm, cottonwood and hackberry. These hardwoods, particularly old-growth hardwoods (50 to 100 years old), contribute to the biodiversity of the wetland system. They also provide food and shelter for wildlife.
<P>
At least 189 species of trees and shrubs, 42 woody vines, 75 grasses and 802 herbaceous plants occur in Texas bottomlands. Bottomland systems also support 116 species of fish, 31 species of amphibians, 54 species of reptiles, 273 species of birds and 45 species of mammals.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#32">(32)</A> Seventy-four species of threatened and endangered animals depend directly on bottomland hardwood systems. Over 50 percent of all the neotropical songbirds that are not listed as endangered or threatened are associated with bottomland hardwood forests. Thirty-one water species (mallards and wood ducks), eastern wild turkey, swamp rabbit, gray squirrel and 11 species of furbearers depend on bottomland hardwoods.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
These bottomland systems also play a vital role in maintaining water quality. By serving as a depository for sediments, wastes and pollutants from runoff, these bottomland forests enhance the water quality of bays and estuaries which lie at the lower end of these riparian corridors. Some pollutants are transformed into less harmful substances by microbiological agents in the floodplain.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#34">(34)</A> Bottomlands also play a critical role in containing floodwaters when rivers overflow. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Forested wetland systems support fish and wildlife populations that are an integral part of the state's $4.2 billion hunting and fishing industry.
</UL>
<P>
In the 18th century, Texas had approximately 16 million acres of hardwood bottomland riparian corridors. Today, the state has 5.9 million acres of bottomland hardwoods -  a 63 percent loss of bottomland hardwood. This acreage currently comprises 3 percent of the total land area of the state.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#35">(35)</A> The majority of bottomland hardwood acres are found in East Texas; only about one million acres are scattered through the western portion of the state.
<P>
Both the Texas Forest Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department recognize that there has been a steady decline in bottomland hardwood forests since the early 19th century.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#36">(36)</A> Texas Parks and Wildlife shows that losses of bottomland hardwoods are continuing in Texas at the rate of about 12 percent per decade.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#37">(37)</A> Reservoirs, development and agriculture threaten bottomland hardwood. But hardwood pulp (ground-up wood fiber) consumption is responsible for the recent upward trend in exploitation of bottomland ecosystems in Texas. Pulpwood consumption in the U.S. is expected to more than double from 82 million tons in l986 to 173 million tons by 2040, and pulpwood demand worldwide has further stimulated increased consumption of hardwoods. This demand is fueled by the demand for high quality computer paper, white cardboard shipping cartons and other paper products, such as six-pack soda carriers, which require a higher hardwood fiber component.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#38">(38)</A> In the U.S., Texas ranks seventh in pulpwood consumption by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#39">(39)</A>

<H4><A NAME="PLAYA">PLAYA LAKES</A></H4>
<P>
Texas playa lakes - shallow, circular basins - are the wintering wetland habitat for millions of waterfowl that migrate from as far north as Canada. There are 20,000 playa lakes located in 37 counties of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. The total area of playa basins has been estimated at 296,000 acres. Fifteen million birds annually migrate through these playas in the fall and spring on their way to and from wintering habitat on the Gulf Coast and farther south.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#40">(40)</A> Ducks, geese and sandhill cranes also use these playas as winter havens. The majority of these oases of wildlife habitat are located within intensively cultivated, privately held farmland. Precipitation and irrigation runoff contribute to the development of these wetlands. Land use practices and changes in irrigation methods intended to limit runoff are reducing the capacity of playas to provide food and water for waterfowl.

<A NAME="CONSERVATION">WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS
</A></H4>
<P>
There are a number of on-going public-private partnerships and country-to-country cooperative arrangements aimed at preserving the rich wetlands found in Texas. Landowner participation in these efforts is voluntary, however, and their success will depend on this participation increasing. 
<P>
The North American Waterfowl Management Plan was signed in 1986 by the Canadian and United States governments. Mexico has also signed an agreement to assist in this effort. The plan's goal is to preserve 6 million acres of wetlands and to increase North America's waterfowl population to more than 100 million birds by the year 2000. Partnerships of public and private organizations work toward the goal of wetland preservation by purchasing or leasing wetlands or using conservation easements. Farm owners are provided economic incentives to strengthen wildlife habitats. Two of the nine joint ventures currently underway are targeting the playa lakes of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico coast stretching from Texas to Alabama. 
<P>
Other public and private initiatives being carried out to protect, maintain, manage and restore wildlife habitat in Texas include the following:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Texas Parks and Wildlife and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are assisting eight landowners in the Texas Panhandle and South Plains to enhance wildlife habitat. The projects are cost-shared, 50-50, by the landowner and the foundation.
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas Department of Transportation is purchasing bottomland hardwood acreage as potential mitigation banking credits. In other words, foreseeing that it might in the future destroy wetlands during highway construction, the Department of Transportation is purchasing bottomland hardwoods to compensate and substitute for any acreage it might destroy. (See focus piece on Mitigation for further discussion.) 
	<P>
	<LI>The Wetlands Reserve Program of the 1990 Farm Bill offers landowners payments for restoring and protecting wetlands on their property. In 1994, $66.75 million was allocated to 20 states, including Texas, to enroll 75,000 acres. Under the program, owners of farm wetlands voluntarily sell permanent easements of farmed wetlands that were converted to farmland prior to December 23, 1985 (prior to the enactment of the 1985 Farm Bill). Farmers get a lump sum equaling no more than the fair market price of the farmland and a cost share payment to assist them in implementing a wetland restoration plan. As of July 1994, Texas had no Wetland Reserve participants; however, approximately 20 Texas farmers have submitted offers to the national Agriculture Stabilization Conservation Service office and are awaiting determination.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#41">(41)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service and Ducks Unlimited created the Texas Prairie Wetlands Project to provide technical assistance and financial incentives to farmers and ranchers interested in improving or restoring wetland habitats along the Gulf Coast. Through January 1994, 4,901 acres of wetland projects had been completed or were under construction for 30 landowners. Another 132 landowners controlling 1,231,023 acres had received on-site technical assistance.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#42">(42)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>Since 1976, Texas Parks and Wildlife biologists have provided technical assistance on ecosystem management to private landowners with 100 acres or more. During fiscal year 1993, 625 technical assistance agreements, representing 6.2 million acres, had been signed between landowners and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
	<P>
	<LI>* Mitigation efforts are also helping to offset the destruction of valuable wildlife habitat. The exact acreage of wildlife habitat that has been preserved through mitigation is difficult to determine because there is no monitoring of the process. (See focus segment on <I>Mitigation</I> for further explanation of this process.) 
</UL>
<P>
The table on page 130 shows wildlife acreage in Texas that the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) plans to acquire in the near future.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#43">(43)</A> The majority of planned acquisitions are additions to existing wildlife sanctuaries. They do not represent new refuges. The term "remaining" refers to those acres that USFWS plans to acquire if granted Congressional appropriations to do so.
<H4>
<A NAME="INFORMATION">INFORMATION AND INCENTIVES FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT PROTECTION
</A></H4>
<P>
Many resource planners, environmentalists and landowners are looking toward a community planning process and various financial and tax incentives for private landowners as the means of habitat preservation. With 97 percent of all land held privately, an incentives approach seems reasonable. The following are some ideas that have been compiled by the Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental organization: <A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	
	<LI>Tax Incentives and Disincentives - 
	<P>
<OL>
		<LI>Local and state property taxes paid on lands providing habitat for endangered, threatened and candidate species and for significant biodiversity would be offset by an annual federal tax credit. Landowners would develop a Habitat Management Plan in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
		<P>
		<LI>Federal tax credits for expenses assumed for improving or creating new habitat for endangered, threatened and candidate species.
		<P>
		<LI>Income tax deductions for revenue from lands managed to support endangered species.
		<P>
		<LI>Tax penalties for converting wildlife habitat to some other use.
		<P>
		<LI>Prohibition on the use of federal subsidies and tax benefits for activities causing the loss or degradation of endangered species habitat.
</OL>
<P>
	<LI>Endangered Species Act's Habitat Conservation Plan - Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act provides for residential and commercial development within an area that has endangered or threatened species habitat whenever a habitat conservation plan is submitted and accepted by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As of 1994, eight habitat conservation plans - the majority in California - have been accepted by the Service. The Balcones Canyonlands Habitat Conservation Plan is in the process for the Austin area. 
	<P>
	<LI>Cooperative Conservation Plan - rural agricultural landowners, who are not interested in developing their land, with contiguous or nearly contiguous property would be able to form cooperatives to accomplish the same goals as the ESA Habitat Conservation Plan without having to participate in an ESA Habitat Conservation Plan. The cooperative would operate as a wildlife management cooperative.
	<P>
	<LI>Habitat Transaction Method - The objective is to preserve habitats sufficient to sustain species and/or populations addressed by a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). A process is established for measuring the conservation value of all the land in the planning area covered by the HCP. Any landowner who agrees to conserve or restore habitat within the planning area receives credits based on the conservation value that the landowner adds to the reserve system. Landowners who receive credits for conservation actions may either use the credits to develop elsewhere within the planning area or sell the credits to any other landowner who needs credits to compensate for project impacts.
	<P>
	<LI>Biodiversity Trust Fund - This proposal suggests that the "takings" provision of the Endangered Species Act be complemented and eventually replaced by a biodiversity trust fund. The trust fund would provide landowners with incentives to protect endangered and threatened species and ecosystems. As author Randall O'Toole envisions it, 10 percent of all public land user fees would be dedicated to the fund each year. A board of trustees nominated by the President and other Cabinet officials would administer the fund. The fund must improve biodiversity or protect endangered or threatened species. Eligible activities for funding include purchase of land, purchases of conservation easements, paying landowners to use certain habitat preservation practices and paying "bounties" to landowners whose land provides breeding habitat for threatened or endangered species.

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In Texas, 12 million acres of prairie land used to extend from San Antonio to Oklahoma. Today, there is less than 1 percent left. Efforts are being made to save what little there is. Students at Gattis Elementary School in the city of Round Rock are trying to preserve 20 acres of blackland prairie where 200 to 300 species of wildflowers and grasses thrive near their school.

In 1993, Governor Ann Richards formed the Governor's Task Force on Nature Tourism in Texas. The Task Force is charged with helping local communities and private landowners develop passive wildlife programs to conserve both wildlife habitat and to stimulate economic growth through environmentally based tourism. The Executive Director of Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Executive Director of the Texas Department of Commerce co-chair the task force. 
<P>
The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service reports that Americans spent $18 billion in 1991 on wildlife-related travel items. During that same year, Texans spent nearly $1 billion dollars on food, lodging and expenses for various wildlife-viewing activities. In Southeast Texas near Houston, a study conducted in 1992 at High Island bird sanctuary concluded that 6,000 bird watchers spent about $1.2 million to see songbirds.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#45">(45)</A>

Though nature tourism holds the promise for economic development for local communities, it also has the potential to damage the very environments and the local communities meant to benefit. Several books have been written on how to minimize the threats that nature tourists have on natural areas and habitats. Two are: Policies for Maximizing Nature Tourism's Ecological and Economic Benefits, written by Kreg Lindberg and published by the World Resources Institute and Nature Tourism: Managing for the Environment, edited by Tensie Whelan and published by Island Press.

<TR><TH> SEDIMENTATION
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Sedimentation is usually the end result of the erosion process. When a soil particle is detached and transported by water to a new site of deposit, it is referred to as sediment. The soil particle might be temporarily deposited several times before it reaches its end destination.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<H4>
<A NAME="EROSION">CROPLAND EROSION AND SURFACE WATER</A>
</H4>
<p>
Cropland erosion has impacts on more than agricultural production. According to studies conducted by the USDA in 1987, agriculture accounts for more than "50 percent of suspended sediments from all sources discharged in surface waters" and greater proportions in predominantly agricultural regions.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#13">(13)</A> Findings of a nationwide study conducted from 1974 to 1981 concluded that surface water sediment deposition was "significantly related to cropland erosion within basins. It was not closely related to estimates of total basin erosion from forest land, pasture land or range land."<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#14">(14) </A> 
<p>
The increased murkiness in the water caused by sediment loading decreases light for submerged aquatic vegetation. As a result, both aquatic vegetation and species that depend on aquatic vegetation for breeding and food can decline.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#15">(15)</A> The relationship between sediment and nutrient runoff from agricultural lands and their effects on estuaries is discussed in the water chapter. Sediment loading can also fill reservoirs, clog navigable waterways, reduce recreational use of waters and increase operating costs of water-treatment facilities.  
<p>
Some sediment deposits can be beneficial, however. For example, the replenishment of beaches is dependent upon sediment deposits from rivers. 
<p>
The USDA estimates that putting 30 to 40 million acres of highly erodible U.S. cropland out of production and into the Conservation Reserve Program will reduce sediment delivery to surface waters by as much as 200 million tons per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#16">(16)</A>
<p>
Texas has no data that show whether various erosion control strategies have reduced sedimentation in Texas surface waters. The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board states that "soil erosion and sediment production continue to be major problems in Texas," though it speculates that there has been significant improvement in the last few decades.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#17">(17)</A> The Board, lead agency for non-point source pollution from agriculture, has recommended expanded stream and reservoir sedimentation studies, stating that past studies have been incomplete.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#18">(18)</A>
<p>
According to the Texas Water Development Board, sediment buildup in reservoirs has not caused a major water supply problem to date, but the agency continues to monitor the situation. The TWDB studies show that Lake Buchanan in Central Texas does have noticeable amounts of sediment as does Lake Corpus Christi.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#19">(19)</A>   
<p>
In Texas, average annual sediment yields - that portion of the total eroded soil that reaches a reservoir - vary from one land resource area to another and vary within land resource areas. According to a USDA study, sediment yields have varied from a low of 0.6 acre-foot per square mile at a site west of Lampasas to a high of 8.60 acre-feet per square mile at a site northeast of Bowie in Montague county.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<A NAME="ABATEMENT">SOIL EROSION ABATEMENT PROGRAMS</A>
</H4>
<p>
One of the best treatments for highly erodible land is to take it out of production and plant grass cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#21">(21)</A> To speed this practice along, the 1985 Farm Bill's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was formulated to provide financial incentives to farmers who voluntarily take highly erodible cropland and other environmentally fragile land (e.g., wetlands, wildlife habitat) out of production for ten years. This means no haying, grazing or harvesting of the land. Though there is a 25 percent cap per county on the amount of land that can be eligible, the program does provide farmers with the opportunity to receive $40 per acre per year rental fee to retire land and a 50/50 cost-share payment to plant a permanent soil-conserving cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<p>
Cropland retired under the CRP was eroding at 13 tons per acre per year. After taking it out of production and establishing coverage, the rate of erosion is 2 tons per year.  
<p>
With 4.2 million acres - 12 percent of all cropland - in the Conservation Reserve Program, Texas has more land in the program than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#23">(23)</A> (Due to the amount of cropland in production, Texas, of course, has more potential acres to be in the CRP.)      
<p>
In 1993, Texas producers received $164 million in rental fees, and approximately $100 million in cost sharing from the inception of the program in 1986 to 1993 in return for taking more than 4 million acres out of production and converting it to grass. The average one-time cost share for establishing grass cover is $25 per acre. More than 80 percent of the CRP acreage is in the High Plains and Rolling Plains. Reduced erosion - an estimated 22 percent reduction on U.S. cropland since 1985 - is not the only benefit of the Conservation Reserve Program. Environmental benefits include improvement in air and water quality and an increase in wildlife habitat for game and nongame birds, mammals and reptiles. Soil conservation specialists in Terry and Lubbock counties report a noticeable reduction in wind erosion and change in air quality as well as an increase in wildlife since cropland has been enrolled in the CRP.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#24">(24)</A>  The Environmental Working Group notes that the CRP has saved the state 144.8 million tons of soil annually.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<p>
The <I>Wall Street Journal </I>reports that the CRP program has its critics. The average age of landowners participating in the program is 64, leading some to believe that it is a "welfare plan" for retired farmers. Others complain that too much good farmland has been allowed in the CRP program. Meanwhile, there are residents of the Texas Panhandle who complain that taking 20 percent of the Plains farmland out of production has devastated related businesses, such as cotton gins and seed, pesticide and equipment dealers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#26">(26)</A> There has also been criticism about the high cost of the CRP. CRP proponents suggest, however, if farmers who are currently enrolled in the CRP were growing rice, cotton, grains and other crops eligible for income supports, their deficiency payments would be equal to, if not more than, the CRP costs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#27">(27)</A> In addition, the USDA estimates the CRP's environmental benefits at between $6 billion and $13 billion over the life of the contracts.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<p>
Unless extended, the CRP program will begin to phase out in 1995. Much of the acreage now enrolled in the CRP will revert to row crop and forage production. A study conducted by Texas Tech University's Department of Agricultural Economics found that, in 55 counties in the Plains, economic considerations will encourage farmers to return 64 percent of the land to crop production unless the CRP is extended.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#29">(29)</A>  This is not just the prediction for Texas; according to the Soil and Water and Conservation Society the return of CRP land to production will occur nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#30">(30)</A> A revised CRP program that targets truly erodible land for inclusion might be presented to Congress in 1995.  
<p>
The other major erosion-abatement provision created by the 1985 Food Security Act is the Conservation Compliance Provision. This provision required farmers who had highly erodible land and who wanted to retain eligibility for government program benefits to implement a conservation plan and have it approved by the Soil Conservation Service by December 31, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#31">(31)</A>   
<p>
Conservation tillage is one good example of mature conservation practices.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#32">(32)</A>  According to the Conservation Technology Information Center, a not-for-profit organization that provides research on soil conservation, 22.4 percent (4,482,961 acres) of Texas cropland is in conservation tillage.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#33">(33)</A> Conservation tillage is expected to increase as a means to meet the requirements of the conservation compliance provision, but experts suggest that continued research is needed to better understand its effects and to determine which types of crops respond best.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#34">(34)</A>

	<p>
	<LI><A NAME="24">The Soil</A> and Water Conservation Society reports that, since 1985, 36.5 million acres--about 8 percent of all U.S. cropland --has been enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Plan. The original enrollment target was 40 to 45 million acres. The direct costs for setting aside 36.5 million acres is estimated to be $19.2 billion over the life of the contracts. This does not include administrative costs or savings on commodity-price and income-support programs. Environmental benefits are estimated to be between $6 billion and $13.6 billion over the life of the contracts.

	<p>
	<LI><A NAME="27">Farmers</A> growing wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans, sugar and other crops are eligible to collect deficiency payments. Deficiency payments are based on the difference between the target price and market price, which ever difference is less. The target price is set by Congress and the USDA. The target price is based on the national average cost of producing a crop. Farmers are eligible to receive a deficiency payment if the market price fails to reach the target price.

	<p>
	<LI><A NAME="31">Government</A> programs that producers will not be eligible for include: diversion payments, Farmers Home Administration loans, deficiency payments, federal crop insurance and conservation reserve payments. Though producers with highly erodible land must have a conservation plan under the conservation compliance policy by December 31, 1994, the conservation plan requirements do not require producers to take highly erodible land out of production. This issue will most likely be addressed in the 1995 Farm Bill.
	<p>
	<LI><A NAME="32">Critics </A>of conservation tillage claim that it increases the use of weed-killing herbicides.  According to Norman Kempf at USDA, herbicides are heavily used during the transition period from conventional tillage to conservation tillage but thereafter phase down.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 6, Air  
Quality, Page 1
</H5>
Air pollution can be hazardous to human health. When people breathe dirty air, pollutants may come into direct contact with their lungs. Polluted air can burn eyes, irritate throats and affect breathing. Some chemicals emitted to the air can cause adverse health effects if released in large enough quantities or over a long enough time. These health effects could include cancer, birth defects, damage to the brain, nervous system or respiratory tract and even, in rare instances, death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#1">(1)</A>
<P>
Air pollution also threatens plants, animals and the natural environment. Acid rain can destroy lakes, rivers and the organisms that inhabit them. Certain compounds degrade the ozone layer above the earth, which serves as a filter for the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The thinning of this upper level atmospheric ozone layer may lead to higher rates of skin cancer and eye damage for both humans and animals. Other pollutants may stunt the growth of trees and vegetation, including agricultural crops, while increased carbon dioxide levels have been found to actually stimulate plant growth, emphasizing the complexity of air pollution problems. 
<P>
Common air pollutants can also damage property, dirtying buildings and corroding monuments and statues. And the haze produced by air pollution can reduce visibility, affecting a number of activities including airplane transportation and tourism.

<P>
<P>
The first efforts to deal legislatively with visible air pollution were directed at smoke emissions from steam boilers. Cincinnati and Chicago passed smoke regulations in 1881; Ohio passed a law to limit these emissions in 1897. It wasn't until the 1940s, however, that new designs which reduced black smoke and saved fuel were phased into factories.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#2">(2)</A> Much less effort was directed at controlling the grime and pollutants generated by oil and gas refineries, factory smokestacks, coal-burning locomotives and automobiles.
<P>
By the 1960s, new concerns were being raised about urban "smog." Smog is a haze made up of thousands of different compounds. Ozone is its most well known constituent. In fact, excessive ground level ozone is the most pervasive air pollution problem in the U.S., creating both health and environmental effects.
<P>
It may seem strange that too little ozone in the upper atmosphere is a problem while too much ozone on ground level is also a problem. However, these types of seeming contradictions are part and parcel of the interrelated air pollution control problems facing us today (see "What is Air Pollution?").
<P>
Smog and other air pollutants are particularly damaging when "trapped" at ground level. This may happen in areas that have experienced a temperature inversion, a meteorological phenomenon in which a warm layer of air lies under a cooler, denser layer. A temperature inversion creates a kind of atmospheric blanket that can prevent pollutants generated on the ground from escaping into the upper atmosphere. When a temperature inversion lingers in an area and winds are calm, air pollutants become concentrated. The results can be deadly; in 1948, a temperature inversion over the Pennsylvania town of Donora resulted in the deaths of 20 people and hospitalized hundreds when sulfur, ozone and air particulates were trapped at ground level.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#3">(3)</A>
<P>
In the wake of the Donora incident, Congress passed a series of bills to study and research the problem of air pollution. But it was not until the 1960 presidential campaign that political leaders began calling for a coordinated, national approach to the problem of air pollution. This concern over air pollution was focused first on the most visible forms of air pollution: smoke, smog and haze. Gradually, legislation has come to address less visible air pollution problems, such as toxic compounds, as well.

</A></H4>
<P>
The following mark significant air pollution events and important steps taken to prevent their recurrence:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>  1948: </B>Air pollution trapped by a temperature inversion in Donora, Pennsylvania results in more than 6,000 inhabitants becoming sick and 20 deaths. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1952: </B>A 5-day temperature inversion in London in December, 1952 causes smoke from open fireplaces and industrial emissions to sicken thousands of Londoners and results in the premature deaths of 4,000 people, many of whom had preexisting heart and lung conditions.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#4">(4)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1963: </B>The Federal Clean Air Act provides funds to support state and local air pollution agencies, to initiate interstate air pollution research and to enforce interstate pollution laws. Because the main policy thrust is the protection of human health, this act is administered by the Public Health Service of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1965: </B>The Texas Air Control Board is created under the Texas Clean Air Act to protect Texas air quality by setting standards, criteria levels and emission limits. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1966: </B>A temperature inversion traps urban air pollution for three days in New York City. Epidemiologists attributes the deaths of 168 people to the episode.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1967: </B>A revised Air Quality Act authorizes HEW to establish federal air-quality standards, requires states and local entities to monitor their "airsheds" - the air located above so-called air quality control regions covering 247 metropolitan areas throughout the U.S. - and requires states to establish standards for specific pollutants in these air quality control regions. However, only 21 states submit their required plan to HEW by the time the 1967 Act expires in 1970.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#7">(7)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1970: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act limit emissions from cars, factories and power plants. The allowable level of sulfur dioxide from utility smokestacks is reduced; refineries are required to phase out lead from gasoline; and automakers are required to cut emissions by 90 percent by 1975. (Congress later gave the automobile industry until 1978 to meet auto air pollution standards after fierce opposition.) The 1970 Act also gives the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the power to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to protect human health and secondary standards to protect the environment. States are required to develop and implement plans to reduce air pollution to levels below these national standards by 1975. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1971: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorize the Texas Air Control Board to issue air quality permits, which begin the following year. Sources of air pollution constructed before 1971, however, are "grandfathered" under the Texas Clean Air Act and do not need to obtain a state permit. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1972: </B>Texas submits the first State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to the EPA detailing measures for meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within the state for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, total suspended particulates and ozone. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1973: </B>The Arab Oil Embargo leads Congress to pass the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1973. To ease pressure on the oil supply, the act requires power plants to switch their fuel sources from oil and natural gas to more polluting coals. It also temporarily suspends emission limits on power plants and other stationary sources like refineries.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1977: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act require companies to install new pollution-control equipment or face stiff penalties. The law also allows states to adopt emission limitations more stringent than federal standards and requires that coordinated transportation planning and clean air planning must take place at the local level. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>The EPA relaxes the national ambient air quality standards for ozone, raising the permissible level from 0.08 to 0.12 parts per million.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>Texas submits a revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board for achieving the NAAQS by December 1982 which results in significant emissions reductions from industry of criteria pollutants in most areas of the state. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1983: </B>The EPA decides to allow states additional time to submit State Implementation Plan revisions, where needed, and to negotiate the control strategy and rule provisions required to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1984: </B>An industrial accident in Bhopal, India at a Union Carbide plant spews methyl isocyanate gas into the local area, killing more than 2,500 people, and hospitalizing tens of thousands.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#8">(8)</A> The event leads to international pressure for better emergency response plans at manufacturing plants and information regarding toxics releases.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>An accident at a Union Carbide plant in Institute, West Virginia sends a poisonous plume of aldicarb oxime over the town, sending 135 people to the hospital. Only a new chemical batching process, instituted at the West Virginia plant after the Bhopal accident, prevents the release of the more toxic methyl isocyanate.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#9">(9)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorizes the Texas Air Control Board to levy administrative penalties for violations of state and national air quality regulations and operating permits are required to be reviewed at 15-year intervals. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1986: </B>The Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act requires companies to report to the Environmental Protection Agency both regular and accidental releases to the air, water or land of more than 300 toxic chemicals. The act also requires manufacturing companies to develop emergency response plans to use in the event of an accident.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1987: </B>Texas submits a substantially revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to satisfy EPA requirements for demonstrating attainment of the ozone standard by the end of 1991. In addition, the agency's vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program is expanded to counties surrounding several ozone non-attainment cities. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1990: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the most far-reaching air pollution prevention legislation ever passed, address airborne toxics, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer, and toughen regulations on vehicles, utilities and other sources of smog-producing emissions. 

	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1993: </B>The Texas Air Control Board, the Texas Water Commission and other agencies related to water pollution control merge to form the newly-created Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

<A NAME="POLLUTION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>What is Air Pollution?</th></tr>
<tr><td>There are many different aspects of air pollution. Whether the pollution is likely to cause environmental or health effects depends on the concentration of pollutants and the amount of time an individual or other receptor is exposed to them. 
<P>
<B>Smog</B> is an often visible haze made up of thousands of constituents, the most abundant, but not necessarily the most toxic of which is ozone. Ozone, especially at elevated levels, can create breathing problems particularly in the young, the old and persons with existing health problems by reducing lung function, increasing sensitivity to asthma and aging lung tissue. It is suspected to irritate the eyes, cause nasal congestion and reduce resistance to colds and other infections. Ozone at elevated levels is toxic to other living organisms as well; it damages plants and trees by affecting the stability of cell walls.
<P>
<B>Particulate matter</B>, produced by the burning of wood, diesel and other fuels, by agricultural activities and industrial processes and by traffic on unpaved roads, is made up of ash, smoke, soot, dust, fibers and liquid droplets. Particulate matter produces a haze that can cause visibility problems. It also dirties and damages buildings and clothes. Smaller particulates, which float in the air, can be inhaled deeply and, with elevated concentrations over an extended period of time, can cause lung damage and bronchitis.<I> </I>Recent studies have linked exposure to these smallest particles to a greater risk of premature death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#5">(5)</A>
<P>
<B>Nitrogen oxides </B>result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, gasoline and oil. At present, automobiles are the main source of nitrogen oxide emissions in urban areas. Nitrogen oxides, at elevated concentrations, can damage the respiratory system. They also can be a key ingredient in the formation of both ozone and acid rain. 
<P>
<B>Sulfur dioxide </B>is released when sulfur-containing fuels like coal and oil are burned. Common sources of sulfur dioxide emissions are electric utilities and certain industrial processes. Sulfur dioxide at elevated concentrations can cause respiratory problems. It also can be a contributing component of acid rain.
<P>
<B>Toxic chemicals such as benzene, toluene and 1,1,1 trichloroethane</B>, when present in the air that we breathe in elevated concentrations over time, can cause various health effects including birth defects, cancer and other health problems. Sources of toxic emissions include industrial processes, such as refineries and chemical manufacturers, small businesses such as printers and dry cleaners and automobiles. 
<P>
<B>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</B> is formed when fuel does not burn completely. Cars and trucks are the main contributors. Carbon monoxide interferes with the blood's ability to transport oxygen to cells and tissues. Exposure to elevated levels of carbon monoxide can cause drowsiness, headaches and sometimes death. Carbon monoxide is particularly hazardous to those who have heart disease or pre-existing lung conditions.
<P>
<B>Lead</B> is a heavy metal that persists in the environment for decades. The former use of leaded gasoline, which is no longer commercially available in most of the United States, the manufacture of lead-based paint and lead-acid battery reclamation operations are sources of lead in the air. Emissions from metal smelters are another source. Exposure to lead at high levels and over time can cause brain and other nervous system damage, particularly in children. Excess exposure to lead can also harm wildlife and is known to cause cancer in animals. 
<P>
<B>Acid Rain</B> forms when the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel-burning plants and other combustion processes combine with rain, fog or snow in the atmosphere. Over time, with conducive geologic conditions, acid rain can increase the acidities of lakes, streams and soils, disturbing or destroying local environments. Wind can carry pollutants far away from where they originated, creating problems in other states or countries.

<P>
<H4>
<A NAME="CLEAN">THE 1990 FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT
</A></H4>
<P>
With the passage of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, Congress toughened national efforts to control air pollution. The 1990 Act addressed some new areas in the field of air pollution control. For the first time, Congress took measures to reduce airborne toxics, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. It strengthened efforts to reduce urban air pollution, in part by imposing new restrictions on mobile sources (cars) and it adopted new market-based approaches to pollution control.
<P>
<B>Criteria Pollutants.</B> The 1970 and 1977 Federal Clean Air Acts required that local metropolitan areas be evaluated by state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether they meet air-quality standards for five pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, total suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. By the time the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act was passed, lead had been added as a criteria pollutant (October, 1978) and particulate matter less than 10 microns in diamter, known as PM10, replaced total suspended particulates (July, 1987). 
<P>
In areas determined not to meet standards for any criteria pollutant, the state air pollution control agency (the TNRCC in Texas) has the responsibility to work with local county and city governments and regional planning commissions to develop and enact a plan to clean up the air. 
<P>
Some 96 metropolitan areas in the U.S. did not meet the standards for ozone as of April, 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#10">(10)</A> Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, all but 10 of these cities must meet ozone standards by 1999 at the latest, and all but Los Angeles, CA - the most heavily polluted city - must comply by 2007. (Los Angeles has until 2010). Similarly, if an area does not meet federal standards for other criteria pollutants, a plan must be developed and implemented to reduce emissions of those pollutants.
<P>
<B>Airborne Toxics. </B>The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act added additional protections against air toxics by ordering the EPA to identify industries that release toxic chemicals and requiring major sources of these chemicals to install "maximum achievable control technology" by the year 2003. Sources other than major sources would be required to install less costly forms of control. There are currently 189 compounds identified by Congress and the EPA as toxic. Compounds may be added or deleted from the list through a petition process. Despite these improvements, there is still debate about whether these control technology levels will be stringent enough to protect those living near industries that emit hazardous air pollutants. For example, some environmental groups have faulted the Act for not putting more stringent controls on certain toxic emissions from large industrial sectors such as utilities - which often release mercury and cadmium emissions - and steel manufacturers - which often release carcinogenic compounds from coke ovens.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
<B>Acid Rain.</B> Emissions of sulfur dioxide - one of the gases that produces acid rain - are subject to stronger controls and monitoring. Power plants will be limited to 8.9 million tons per year of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, down from 19 million tons per year emitted in 1980. This reduction will be accomplished in two phases, with the 110 "dirtiest" utilities (those with the most emissions) - most of which are in the Midwest - accounting for most of the cuts by 1995. By 2000, the remaining major utilities, including those in Texas, must also reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.
<P>
<B>Atmospheric Ozone. </B>Ozone can be helpful or harmful to humans and the environment depending on where it is. High above the earth in the stratosphere, an ozone layer protects life on earth from harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun. At ground level, though, ozone is a harmful constituent of smog. The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act phased out the production of certain chemicals that may deplete the stratospheric ozone layer and regulated the disposal of other possible ozone-depleting substances. For example, methyl chloroform, a solvent widely used in such products as automobile brake cleaner and fabric spot removers, must be phased out by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#12">(12)</A> Freon, the refrigerant used in the majority of air conditioning units, is also being phased out.
<P>
<B>Mobile Sources.</B> The Federal Clean Air Act imposed reductions in the amount of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides present in tailpipe exhaust for all 1994 vehicles and required that these standards be maintained for 100,000 miles. The Act also dictated the sale of only "reformulated" gasoline, which reduces volatility and toxic components and increases oxygen content, in the cities with the highest levels of ground-level ozone pollution and the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content in those cities that exceed standards for carbon monoxide. In Texas, the reformulated gasoline requirements apply to Houston, while oxygenated fuel requirements apply in El Paso. In cities where ozone pollution exceeds standards, the Federal Act requires consumers have their car or vehicle tailpipe emissions tested. Vehicles that do not meet the emission standards they were built to meet would have to be repaired. 
<P>
Finally, the Act encouraged the development and sale of alternative fuels such as ethanol, liquified petroleum gas and natural gas by requiring manufacturers to begin producing such cars for sale - starting with the manufacture of 500,000 of these clean-fuel cars for sale in Southern California in 1999.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#13">(13)</A> The Act also required private and government owners of large fleets of cars to purchase certain alternative fuel vehicles for their fleets in those cities with the most severe ozone problems (see section on Mobile Sources).
<P>
<B>Using the Market to Control Pollution.</B> The 1990 Clean Air Act significantly changed the government's approach to controlling air pollution, embracing for the first time a market-based strategy designed to give companies incentives to comply. 
<P>
Here's how the system works. Under Title IV of the Clean Air Act, each of the 110 electric utilities with the most sulfur dioxide emissions is granted a set number of pollution "allowances," based on its historical fuel use. An allowance is equivalent to one ton of sulfur dioxide emissions. Each utility may emit sulfur dioxide up to the limit imposed by its allowances. However, if a utility emits less than its allotted amount by being more efficient, using a lower-sulfur fuel or using a renewable energy source like solar or hydroelectric power, it may sell its unused allowances to another utility as "pollution credits." Conversely, if a utility cannot stay within the limits imposed by its allowances, it can buy pollution credits from a less polluting utility. The system has two major advantages: it rewards companies that pollute less and yet it is flexible enough to accommodate companies which can not meet the standard of pollution control.  
<P>
In addition to the allowances granted to companies based upon historical fuel use, 300,000 allowances (about 2.8 percent of the nearly 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emitted each year) are placed in a special "Energy and Renewable Energy" reserve to reward companies for adopting new efficiency measures or renewable energy projects. These reserve allowances can either be sold directly by the company or be auctioned through the Chicago Board of Trade. On March 29, 1993, buyers at the Chicago Board of Trade paid $21.4 million for the right to emit 150,010 tons of sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<P>
In 2000, a second phase of the program will extend "basic" allowances to all electric-steam utilities generating more than 25 megawatts. These two phases should help reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from 19 million to 8.9 million tons per year between 1985 and 2010.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#16">(16)</A> 
<P>
In theory, the market-based approach is designed to reduce pollution in the most cost-effective manner. The traditional "command and control" approach usually employed in environmental legislation would have required two different companies to reduce emissions in the same way. The market system permits Company A to reduce emissions to meet the requirements for both emitters and then sell some of these allowances to Company B at a lower price than would be needed for B to reduce pollutants. 
<P>
Still, there are potential flaws in this "free trade" system. For example, the allowance program assumes that reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions will be of equal benefit to human health and the environment regardless of where they are made. This is not always true; some areas of the country are more prone to acid rain than others. The Adirondack Council, the local governing structure of the famous state park in upstate New York, has protested the fact that New England utilities will be allowed to sell pollution credits to Midwestern utilities, whose pollution is the source of acid rain already damaging Northeastern forests, lakes and rivers.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#17">(17)</A>
<P>

<A NAME="MARKET">*</A><center>
<TABLE BORDER=5 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>Market Incentives in Texas</th></tr>
<tr><td>Texas is actively developing a variety of market-based mechanisms to reduce air pollution, including ozone, nitrogen oxide and pollution from cars. A few of these programs are described below.
<P>
<B>Emission Reductions Credit Banking Program. </B>Under the Federal Clean Air Act, any major new source of emissions in those areas that do not meet ozone standards -  Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso and Beaumont/Port Arthur - must be more than offset by the reduced emissions from existing sources. For example, in order for a new industry that emits 50 tons per year of either nitrogen oxide or volatile organic compounds to locate in the El Paso area, there must be a corresponding reduction of 60 tons per year of those pollutants within El Paso. 
<P>
<B>"Emission reduction credits"</B> are seen as a flexi-ble alternative that allows growth to occur while still reducing overall pollution as required by the Clean Air Act. Under Texas' "Emissions Reductions Banking Rule," adopted in 1993, sources of VOCs and nitrogen oxide emissions receive emission reduction credits if they reduce emissions below the level required by law, either through a permanent reduction in emissions or by closing an emission source. These reduction credits are certified by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and recorded or "deposited" in the Emissions Reductions Bank. A company can then sell its credits to companies within the same non-attainment area to new industries arriving in the area that need offsets for new permits or expansion of existing facilities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#14">(14)</A> 
<P>
<B>Nitrogen Oxide Trading. </B>In Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur, all major sources of nitrogen oxide such as utilities and petroleum refineries are required to achieve specific reductions in emissions by May 31, 1997 using "Reasonably Available Control Technology" (RACT). Under a new rule passed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, rather than meeting this 1997 compliance deadline through RACT, a source could instead continue to emit previous levels of emissions by buying emission credits. For example, a source with multiple emission units could trade across units to achieve allowable emission levels even if some individual units did not comply. Or, two different facilities could trade among themselves so that the total emissions averaged out to the compliance level of emissions for the area. Under the Nitrogen Oxide RACT rule, however, a company could not use emission credits to increase pollution, only to meet the RACT emission limits. 
<P>
<B>Alternative Fuels Program. </B>Under a new rule adopted by the TNRCC, vehicles using conventional fuels in a private or public fleet which needs to comply with Clean Air Act requirements could be converted or scrapped in favor of vehicles using cleaner fuels not currently required by regulation. The resulting decrease in emissions would generate mobile emission reduction credits, which could be sold to other fleet operators unable to comply with fleet regulations.

<H4><A NAME="NATIONAL">NATIONAL</A> AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
</H4>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act contained other market-based approaches to pollution control. The EPA may now issue allowances to companies for the manufacture of chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that deplete atmospheric ozone even though the manufacture of these chemicals is being phased out. The Act also has provisions that allow one facility's reductions in ozone-forming pollutants or toxic chemicals to offset increased emissions at another facility. Texas has embraced several of these new market-based approaches in its effort to reduce pollution.
<P>
How these efforts will ultimately improve air quality is still unknown. The EPA says that 90 million Americans live in cities that are non-attainment for at least one of the six main air pollutants targeted by the Federal Clean Air Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#18">(18)</A> In addition, there are possible global problems -  such as ozone depletion and global warming -  which may defy strictly national solutions. Other "air" issues, such as indoor air pollution, are not addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act at all.
<P>
Moreover, none of the changes mandated by the law come cheaply. Industries large and small will feel the effects of the Federal Clean Air Act. For example, in areas of the state not meeting ozone standards, tough new emission standards will require businesses to install expensive pollution control equipment. These businesses will also have to apply for new federal operating permits. In some sectors, such as electric utilities and petroleum refineries, these requirements have already led to some job losses. Even small businesses like dry cleaners, bakeries and printers will have to install new equipment to control emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Because the Federal Clean Air Act greatly expanded the scope of government regulation, the government's cost of monitoring and enforcing air-quality law has also increased.  
<P>
These anticipated economic impacts were the main source of opposition to the bill. Still, the Act will create new markets for alternative fuels, pollution control equipment and new services, thus creating new jobs. And supporters believe that the economic value of the Act's public-health benefits - measured in fewer sick days, hospitalizations and deaths - will more than offset initial economic costs.

With 18 million cars on its roads, 442 electric utility generators using gas, oil, coal and other sources of fuel, 60 percent of the nation's petrochemical production, 25 percent of the nation's refining capacity and a population of more than 18 million people, Texas must grapple with the full range of clean air issues. The state consistently ranks at or near the top of the list in air toxic emissions, reflective of the disproportionate amount of petrochemical production relative to the rest of the country. Half of the state's population lives in "non-attainment" cities, which do not meet federal standards for clean air.
<P>
This chapter discusses air quality in Texas, outlining the problems and summarizing the efforts to deal with it. It is divided into six sections:
<P>

	<LI>  National Ambient Air Quality Standards
	<P>
	<LI>  Clean Air Act Compliance in Texas

</B><P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Acts set forth air quality standards for six pollutants: ozone (03), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable particulate matter (PM10) and lead (Pb). The Environmental Protection Agency has determined an allowable limit for each of these pollutants that is intended to protect the public from exposure to dangerous levels. These national standards are known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
<P>
One set of standards, called primary standards, is designed to protect human health. Another set, called secondary standards, is designed to protect the environment and limit property damage. Any area of a city that exceeds a standard causes the entire metropolitan area to be in violation. Since the EPA began regulating these pollutants, levels of all have declined. Most emissions have shown a modest decline. The exception is lead, which showed a sharp decline (90 percent) between 1982 and 1991. This dramatic reduction is due largely to the phase out of leaded gasoline which began in the 1970s. Today, the most abundant single pollutant is carbon monoxide, accounting for about 50 percent of total emissions by weight. 
<P>
At monitoring stations around the state, the four gaseous criteria pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) are monitored continuously, with one-hour averages measured each hour, every day. PM10 and lead are measured at least once every six days for a 24-hour averaging period, although some sites in Texas are monitored more frequently. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, local governmental agencies and some private organizations monitor for criteria pollutants (see box in text on monitoring).

<H4>
<A NAME="OZONE">A. OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
In the upper atmosphere, ozone (O3), an oxygen molecule with three, rather than two, oxygen atoms, forms a layer that filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Concern about the thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer has led to bans on the use of certain chemicals, such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, that may destroy ozone. 
<P>
Though atmospheric ozone helps sustain life, ozone formed near the ground may adversely affect plants, animals and humans. Ozone is produced when reactive hydrocarbons known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight. Ozone problems are most common in the hot summer months because the warm air and sunlight speed ozone formation. 
<P>
Volatile organic compounds are emitted from a wide variety of sources. These include automobiles and other vehicles (referred to as "mobile sources" in the Federal Clean Air Act); refineries and chemical manufacturing plants ("major stationary sources"); paint shops and dry cleaners ("minor" or "area sources"); recreational boats, ships, barges, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, and locomotives ("off-road mobile sources"); and plants and trees ("biogenics"). Yes, even trees contribute to VOCs (see box in text). Nitrogen oxide comes from some of the same sources - automobiles, boats, trains and planes, and refineries - as well as from service stations, home heating and cooling units, wastewater treatment plants, power plants and forest fires. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has estimated both the amount and the sources of VOCs and NOx released into the atmosphere in major Texas metropolitan areas.
<P>
<B>Non-Attainment Areas.</B>
<P>
Four metropolitan areas in Texas have exceeded the national standards for ozone often enough to be currently classified as non-attainment areas. They are: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Dallas/Fort Worth and El Paso. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria metropolitan area reports the highest numbers of days exceeding ozone standards in Texas. In general, Texas cities have shown a decline over the past 10 years in the number of days exceeding national standards. Other large Texas cities like Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi have met the ozone standard since the early 1980s. Still, in both 1993 and 1994, Corpus Christi exceeded the one-hour ozone standards on one occassion, and Austin and San Antonio approached it.
<P>
<B>Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone.</B>
<P>
High levels of ozone - including levels above the 0.125 parts per million standard - can have serious human health effects. Ozone reacts with lung tissue and can cause breathing problems. The risk of asthma may be increased and people may cough and have chest pains. For unknown reasons, about 10 to 20 percent of the population, sometimes referred to as "responders," is especially sensitive to high ozone concentrations. This group, along with people with pre-existing respiratory diseases and people who exercise outdoors, are particularly at risk from high ozone levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#20">(20)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">A 1988 study for the American Lung Association estimated that if ozone standards had been met throughout the United States in 1983, 49.9 million cases of adverse health symptoms and 1.9 million asthma attacks would have been eliminated.

<P>
High ground levels of ozone can also have negative environmental effects. It is believed to affect crop and forestry production by damaging the cell walls of plants. In 1987, the East Texas Intensive Research Site was established near Nacogdoches to investigate how pollutants affect the development of one- to four-year-old short leaf pines along coastal plains. The study subjected some trees to persistent exposure to ozone and the trees showed loss of needles, stunted growth and fewer stems.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#21">(21)</A>

<tr><th>DO TREES POLLUTE?</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Do trees pollute? In the early 1980s, then-President Ronald Reagan and some noted scientists attracted attention when they confirmed that trees themselves are a possible source of some types of air pollution. Trees do contribute to the formation of ozone by releasing volatile organic compounds such as isoprene, monoterpene and alpha-pinene. 
<P>
Under Title 1 of the Federal Clean Air Act, states are required to estimate how much trees and plants contribute to VOC production for those areas that exceed ozone standards. The sources of these VOCs, known collectively as "biogenics," include forests, crops, lawn grasses and other vegetation. The more vegetation an area has, the more these biogenics will contribute to overall VOC levels. For example, biogenics are estimated to account for 22 percent of all VOCs emitted in the woody Houston/Galveston area, but only 12 percent in the arid El Paso area.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#19">(19)</A> Of course, biogenic sources are natural sources of air pollution and no one is suggesting that trees be cut to reduce pollution. In fact, the air quality benefits of biogenics far outweigh the costs since plants produce oxygen, filter the air and prevent erosion. Biogenic sources are not figured into the calculation of how much an area must reduce VOC emissions.

<A NAME="SULFUR">B. SULFUR DIOXIDE</A> AND NITROGEN OXIDES - THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ACID RAIN
</H4>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are gases released when fossil fuels are burned. When these gases react with water in the atmosphere, sulfuric acid and nitric acids can form and fall as rain, commonly referred to as "acid" rain. In areas with little precipitation, the acids may become incorporated into dust and smoke and fall to the ground as "dry" acid.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#22">(22)</A> Acid rain can harm or kill fish by making lakes and rivers more acidic, i.e. by lowering the pH. It can also damage buildings, stone and monuments as well as crops and forests. Studies indicate that acid rain can also reduce crop yields both by damaging foliage and by causing minerals to leach from the soil.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#23">(23)</A>  While adverse affects have been reported in the Northeast, no harmful effects have been documented in Texas. This is because of two factors: 1) the strongly alkaline soils characteristic of much of the state; and 2) the absence of a snow pack melt common in more northern states.
<P>
Both nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide have been linked to the formation of acid rain and acidic lakes. Pinpointing the cause of acid rain is difficult, primarily because of multiple emission sources and complex meteorology. Rain can become acidic as a result of water reacting with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. But other factors, such as acidic waste runoff and naturally high acidic levels in lakes or streams, may also contribute to acidity. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board, later the TNRCC, and the federal government began monitoring the acidity (pH) of rain at 15 different sites. In general, the pH was lower - more acidic - in rainfall collected in East Texas.
<P>
Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides have other harmful effects in addition to their ability to form acid rain deposition. At high levels, nitrogen oxides are known to cause lung damage and other respiratory illness, particularly in children and people suffering from asthma.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#24">(24)</A> In Texas, nitrogen dioxide has never exceeded the national standard set in 1973. It does, however, contribute to the formation of ozone (see previous section). 
<P>
High concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air may cause difficulty in breathing and a choking sensation. Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and people with chronic lung and heart disease are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of sulfur dioxide. 
<P>
Unlike nitrogen oxide - which is mainly the result of automobile and utility emissions - sulfur dioxide is emitted chiefly from industrial sources like power plants using sulfur-containing fuel, metallic-ore smelting facilities, wood and paper industrial processors and oil and gas refineries. 
<P>
Sulfur dioxide levels in Texas vary across the state. The Houston/Galveston/Texas City area, the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, and the El Paso metropolitan area have shown the highest levels of SO2 measured in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#25">(25)</A> While most areas in the state do not exceed or even approach the air quality standards for SO2, tests conducted between 1985 and 1989 by the Houston Regional Monitoring Network, a private organization, showed sulfur dioxide levels in excess of national standards 13 times in the industrial district of the Houston Ship Channel.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#26">(26)</A> Cooperative action between local industries, the TNRCC and the EPA has resulted in a voluntary reduction in SO2 emissions in the local area and no violations have been recorded since 1990.

<A NAME="CARBON">C. CARBON MONOXIDE</A>
</H4>
<P>
A colorless, odorless gas, carbon monoxide results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, most often in motor vehicles and power plants. Carbon monoxide can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the heart, brain and other tissues. People with heart disease and unborn or newborn children are especially susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#27">(27)</A> The area in Texas where the highest levels of CO are measured is El Paso, but even here, the NAAQS has not been exceeded more than 10 times per year. Carbon monoxide has also been identified as a possible precursor to the formation of ozone.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
Unlike ozone, carbon monoxide levels usually rise with colder weather, when atmospheric conditions are more stable. In Texas, only El Paso has consistently exceeded the eight-hour standard for carbon monoxide concentrations. Most notably, however, levels measured in recent years are lower than those measured ten years ago. Dallas exceeded standards twice in 1985, while Houston exceeded standards nine times between 1974 and 1986. No other exceedences in these two cities have since been recorded due to state and federal efforts to control carbon monoxide emissions. According to the 1990 EPA data base, El Paso ranked 5th in the nation, behind Steubenville, Ohio; Provo, Utah; Los Angeles, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada for levels of eight-hour concentrations of carbon monoxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#29">(29)</A> However, 1994 data places El Paso behind eleven other U.S. cities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#30">(30)</A>
<P>
El Paso is a special case because it shares a common airshed with Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico and is affected by that city's air pollution. A special section later in this chapter -  "Sharing Air Along the U.S. - Mexico Border" -  highlights some of these issues. In Texas, the levels and sources of carbon monoxide vary by location.

<A NAME="PARTICULATE">D. PARTICULATE MATTER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The category of air pollutant called "respirable particulate matter" includes liquids, hydrocarbons, soots, dusts, acids from aerosols and smoke particles that are smaller than 10 microns in diameter. This 10-micron size limit has led to the abbreviation of respirable particulate matter as "PM 10." These tiny particles make up about 55 percent of the total mass of suspended particles in air pollution, and come from the burning of fuels by industry, power plants and motor vehicles; from refuse incinerators; from dust created by construction, agriculture and unpaved roads; and from natural sources such as wind erosion.
<P>
While the nose can filter out larger particulates, PM10 can penetrate deep into the lungs. The further a particle penetrates and the higher the concentration, the more likely it is to cause wheezing, nose and throat irritation, bronchitis and lung damage. Chemicals such as toxic compounds attached to PM10 emissions can increase the potential for adverse effects. Groups at high risk include children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema. Beyond these health hazards, PM10 reduces visibility and can discolor clothing and property.
<P>
In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency revised its air quality standards for PM10, allowing a maximum of 150 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24-hour basis, or 50 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual average. Previously, the EPA had no specific standard for PM10, instead relying on a standard for all particulate matter, including particulate matter larger than 10 microns. The EPA estimates that adherence to these new standards will save 3,600 lives, reduce lost work days by 190,000 days and "reduced-activity" days, when people work less efficiently because of ill health, by 910,000 days.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#31">(31)</A>
<P>

Still there has been considerable debate about whether these levels adequately safeguard human health and some studies have suggested that standards should be strengthened.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#32">(32)</A> A recent study, which controlled for the effects of smoking, found that mortality risks are more strongly associated with concentrations of respirable particles and sulfates - the combination of sulfur dioxide with air - than with other common air pollution problems such as ozone or sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">Another study tracked 552,138 men and women across the United States from 1982 to 1989 and evaluated the effects of particulate air pollution - including sulfates and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns - on mortality. The study found an association between mortality due to cardiopulmonary diseases and particulate matter air pollution.

Arden Pope III, Micheal Thun, Mohan Namboodiri, Douglas Dockery, John Evans, Frank Speizer and Clark Heath, Jr., "Particulate Air Pollution as a Predictor of Mortality in a Prospective Study of U.S. Adults," </I>American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care Medicine<I>, Vol. 151 (1995): 669 - 674.</I>
</UL>
<P>
While the EPA is currently reviewing the Federal PM10 standard, some states have already adopted a more stringent standard. For example, the state of California, after reviewing studies on morbidity and mortality from PM10 exposure, adopted a state air-quality standard for particulate matter of 50 micrograms over 24 hours. 
<P>
In Texas, only El Paso County has repeatedly exceeded both the 24-hour and annual standards set in 1987 for PM10. Other areas have occasionally exceeded this standard. In 1992, there were two exceedences out of 337 samples in El Paso. In 1993, there were none, while in 1994, there were two exceedences.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#34">(34)</A> In El Paso, particulate matter levels rise during winter months, due mainly to combustion of wood and other fuels for heating. 
<P>
El Paso is also impacted by particulate matter drifting from Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez in Mexico. Common sources of this particulate matter include unpaved roads and industrial combustion processes such as the incineration of garbage, including tires, without adequate controls. However, without adequate emissions inventories and ambient air quality monitoring in Ciudad Juarez to record air quality over time, it is difficult to determine if emissions are going down. TNRCC, the Environmental Defense Fund and others are working with Mexican environmental officials to address these needs.

<A NAME="LEAD">E. LEAD</A>
</H4>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1991, air emissions of lead in the United States were reduced from 52,000 to 5,000 tons per year, largely as a result of the country's phase-out of leaded gasoline.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#35">(35)</A> Nevertheless, lead continues to pose a public health threat, in part because of its persistence in the environment. Lead poisoning can lead to retardation in cognitive development in children, reduce mental ability and damage nerves and organs like livers and kidneys. It also may interfere with the creation of blood and raise blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#36">(36)</A> Because lead accumulates in the body organs, bones and blood, even chronic exposure to small amounts can be harmful to both human and animal life. Besides leaded gasoline, sources of lead pollution in the air include metal smelters and the manufacture and reclamation of lead batteries. Children and pregnant women are most at risk from exposure to high lead levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#37">(37)</A>
<P>
In Texas, outside air pollution from lead is now limited to a handful of areas. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, citizens were concerned about the number of lead smelters and battery plants in the area, but most of these facilities were shut down in the mid-1980s. Suspected health problems from exposure to high lead levels continue to concern Dallas-area residents. However, monitors show no exceedences at this time. In the city of Frisco in Collin County, ambient air levels of lead have exceeded national standards in an area of approximately one-half mile near a major battery plant. However, the last exceedences for lead national standards were in 1987.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#38">(38)</A> Although lead exposure concerns had been raised over a 1.5-mile square surrounding an old battery reclamation plant in San Antonio, the site is currently designated as "unclassified" by the EPA until further monitoring can confirm the levels of lead in the air. 
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, several monitoring sites in the city of El Paso violated national standards for lead. However, the closing of a lead smelter plant in 1985 and the phase-out of leaded gasoline have brought levels in El Paso to within the allowable limit since 1986. Generally speaking, lead is not a big problem in ambient air in Texas. Thus, there is a greater potential for lead exposure in individual households because of the possible presence of peeling lead-based paint.

<tr><th>AIR QUALITY MONITORING: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW?
</th></tr><tr><td>
If you can't always see it, taste it, or maybe even smell it, how do you know air pollution is there? Texas' extensive monitoring network strives to answer that question by measuring concentrations of ambient air pollutants. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission operates more than 80 permanent monitoring sites located across the state. In addition, six local governmental entities and four private organizations monitor the six criteria pollutants at other stations in an effort to pinpoint local problems. Many of these stations also monitor air toxics. 
<P>
Despite the presence of these monitors in the major metropolitan areas, federal requirements and citizen concern about the health effects of toxics are generating a demand for more and better air-quality monitoring. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has invested about $1.5 million a year since 1992 to expand and operate its air toxics monitoring network. The agency plans to add 29 new toxic air monitoring stations by the end of 1995. Despite the large volume of toxics released each year into the air by Texas industries, ambient air toxics monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has not identified them as a significant public health risk.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#39">(39)</A> Air toxics selected for monitoring were those emitted in the largest quantities from multiple sources. While it is not possible to monitor for all chemical compounds emitted, the results of monitoring currently conducted are considered indicative of broad-based public exposure to other compounds by the TNRCC. Some monitoring methods collect average samples of toxics, and thus, higher peak concentrations would not be quantified, although they would be represented as part of the average itself.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#40">(40)</A> 
<P>
To complement its monitoring system, the TNRCC is investing in a more complete toxics monitoring network and expanding its use of mobile monitoring equipment, which includes a self-contained mobile laboratory, sampling vans and an air toxics response trailer.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#41">(41)</A>

<A NAME="ACT"><H4>FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
Under Title 1 of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, any area that violates National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the six criteria pollutants as few as once per year and as often as four times over a three-year period is classified as a "non-attainment area." Texas currently has four such areas, encompassing 17 counties. Victoria County and portions of Bexar County have been designated "unclassified" because their monitoring data for ozone and lead, respectively, have not been adequate to measure pollution levels precisely. The Houston Ship Channel in the Houston metropolitan area had been proposed as a non-attainment area for sulfur dioxide. However, recent cooperative activities by the TNRCC, EPA and industries in the area resulted in the submission of an attainment demonstration to the EPA.
<P>
Non-attainment areas for ozone, CO and PM10 are classified according to the severity of their air pollution. Each area is included in a State Implementation Plan (SIP) designed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to bring the area into compliance. Different areas may have different deadlines for complying with the SIP plan, depending upon the severity of their air pollution problem. If a non-attainment area fails to comply with air pollution standards by the deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency may extend the deadline, but impose more stringent requirements to meet the standards. If there is a failure to develop a proper State Implementation Plan or a failure to implement the plan, the Environmental Protection Agency may develop a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area and may impose sanctions for non-compliance including the loss of federal highway funds, bans or stiffer limits on further industrial expansion and the loss of federal Air Pollution Control Program grant funds. 
<P>
The economic costs of non-attainment are substantial. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission estimates that it will cost $200 billion to bring Texas' four ozone non-attainment areas into compliance.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#42">(42)</A> By 1996, the four ozone non-attainment areas must reduce levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 15 percent, net of growth, from 1990 levels. This net reduction requirement means that before any new sources of VOCs can be allowed to operate, reductions must be made in existing sources to offset the new emissions. Thus, the actual total reduction is significantly higher than 15 percent. 
<P>
Once volatile organic compounds are reduced by 15 percent by 1996, serious and severely polluted areas - which include Houston, El Paso and Beaumont - will still be required to reduce either volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides an average of 3 percent each year for three years, or until standards are met. Thus, future economic growth and reductions in air pollution are linked together. 
<P>
The State Implementation Plan is also requiring consumers, small businesses and major industries in non-attainment areas to radically alter their activities. For example, in non-attainment areas, the following programs, many of which are still undergoing refinement, are being required:
<UL>
<LI> Under the state's most recent plan to control ozone pollution, automobile owners would be required to have emissions from their vehicles tested every two years. Vehicles that do not meet emission standards would have to be repaired at the owner's expense. However, in 1995, the Texas Legislature passed a statewide moratorium on inspections to reconsider the program. Still, some sort of vehicle emission testing will likely be required in non-attainment areas.
<P><LI> Service stations are required to install equipment to control gasoline vapors at the pump and as fuel is being unloaded into storage tanks. Most stations were to comply by 1994; smaller stations that were built before 1992 and sell less than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month are exempt. 
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area residents will have to use only reformulated gasoline, a cleaner-burning fuel.
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area must reduce the number of cars and trucks commuting to and from work through an employer trip reduction program. The program has been delayed six months by actions of the Legislature and Governor, however.
<P><LI> El Paso residents will have to use oxygenated gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
<P><LI> Specific industries will be required to install pollution-control equipment beyond what is required under current regulations.
<P><LI> Small businesses like dry cleaners, paint shops, printers and autobody shops will have to install pollution-control equipment.
<P><LI> In El Paso, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston/Galveston, industrial wastewater systems will be required to cover wastewater treatment areas and route the vapors through a control device.
<P><LI> All new or expanding major industries in a non-attainment area must apply for non-attainment source review permits, which are more stringent than attainment area permits, known as prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permits.
<P><LI> The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has designated five other metropolitan areas as "near non-attainment" areas. These areas are: Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Victoria, and the Tyler/Longview/Marshall area. They are called near non-attainment because they have on occasion exceeded standards, because they were once non-attainment areas but have since come into compliance, or because of their potential for future growth. In 1993, for example, both Tyler/Longview/Marshall and Corpus Christi exceeded ozone standards for a single day - not enough to cause the cities to go out of compliance, but cause for concern. The state and local officials are working on voluntary programs in these and other cities to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
</UL>
<P>
Because the Clean Air Act limits growth in non-attainment areas by requiring that existing companies offset any new emissions, new industries may be inclined to locate in cities without immediate pollution problems. This growth could cause an increase in emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides in these cities, and could cause them eventually to exceed federal air-quality standards. 
<P>
The criteria pollutants covered by the Federal Clean Air Act are not the only pollutants. Air toxics, greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting chemicals and a wide variety of indoor air particulates are also of great concern.

<A NAME="BINATION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>ACHIEVING CLEAN AIR IS A BINATIONAL PROBLEM FOR EL PASO
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
El Paso is the only city in Texas in violation of national standards for both respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The city is also designated as a "serious" non-attainment area for ozone. El Paso has been in compliance with national standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and, since 1986, with lead standards. 
<P>
El Paso and other cities along the Texas/Mexico border face unique pollution problems because environmental standards differ on the two sides of the border. In fact, air pollution originating in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico - which lies in a desert valley across the Rio Grande River from El Paso - may contribute as much or more to overall air pollution in El Paso than pollution originating on the U.S. side of the border. These two cities, along with Sunland Park, New Mexico, share a common airshed in a valley characterized by the Rio Grande River and surrounding moun-tain peaks. Temperature inversions in the area contribute to air pollution problems. 
<P>
A 1990 joint study by the EPA, Texas Air Control Board, El Paso City/County Health Department and Mexican authorities found that the highest concentrations of particulate matter occurred in urban Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and in the mountain pass along the border.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#43">(43)</A> The principle sources of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and ozone in the area include motor vehicles, industries located in the airshed and open burning of domes-tic and agricultural waste. 
<P>
A problem specific to the area is the large number of vehicles waiting to enter or exit the United States from Mexico. The El Paso - Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez border crossing is one of the busiest crossings along the border. Each vehicle crossing the border, about 40 percent of which have Mexican license plates, must wait at least 10 minutes at the border while their paperwork is processed. Vehicles at idle produce higher emissions. Mexican vehicles, because they are older and often have less stringent maintenance and emission controls, tend to be higher emitters.
<P>
If the TNRCC can prove that pollution emanating from outside the United States prevents El Paso's compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the criteria pollutants - ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter - then the city will not bump up to a severe non-attainment area if the attainment deadlines are not met. This dispensation would also keep the city from suffering federal sanctions including the loss of federal highway funds and construction grants. However, El Paso will still have to adopt stringent pollution control rules to comply with the FCAA.
<P>
For the past two years, state and local officials, environmental groups and business interests from the U.S. and Mexico have been working on the concept of an International Air Quality Management District encompassing the two cities and surrounding areas. Under one proposal, the District would coordinate monitoring and set caps on emissions within the airshed, while also allowing for flexibility to meet these standards. For example, rather than investing in expensive pollution con-trol equipment, new businesses in El Paso might offset their emissions by instead investing in a similar facility in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, or helping pave Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez streets.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#44">(44)</A>

<A NAME="ISSUES"><H3>AIR QUALITY ISSUES</A>
</H3><H4>
<A NAME="TOXICS">AIR TOXICS
</A></H4>
<P>
Air toxics is a term which describes a broad group of non-criteria pollutants including NESHAP pollutants (hazardous air pollutants regulated by National Emission Standards established and enforced by the EPA), workplace pollutants, state-regulated pollutants, toxics compounds covered by the Toxics Release Inventory Program and other toxic pollutants addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act. While total emissions of these compounds are small compared to the criteria air pollutants - they are usually measured in pounds, not tons - their potential impact on human health can be great, especially for individuals living near a source of emissions or a spill release. Upon inhalation, air toxics are brought into the lungs, where some are readily absorbed into the blood stream. Some air toxics can also irritate sensitive tissues in the eyes, throat and nose. Some may cause cancer in humans. Others may cause reproductive dysfunctions, birth defects or nervous system disorders. 
<P>
The 1986 Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act requires businesses to report all releases into the air, water, or ground of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemical compounds. These data are compiled into the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Recently, the EPA added an additional 286 chemicals to the list of chemicals which must be reported by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#45">(45)</A> Texas leads the nation in air toxics releases, accounting in 1992 for about 7.5 percent of all toxic air emissions nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#46">(46)</A> However, between 60 percent and two-thirds of the nation's petrochemical capacity occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#47">(47)</A>
<P>
Industrial toxics emissions are just part of total toxic air emissions. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board estimated that these releases accounted for only 18 percent of total toxic air emissions, while mobile sources - automobiles, motorcycles, pickups, vans and trucks -  accounted for 24 percent. "Area sources" - dry cleaners, solvent and paint shops and wastewater treatment plants among others - emit up to three times the amount of toxics emitted statewide by major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#48">(48)</A> Still, the contribution of total air toxic emissions of each of these categories - industrial, mobile and area sources - varies widely with location.
<P>
The EPA has had the authority to set standards for hazardous air pollutants since 1970. Because of sparse medical data, however, the EPA has faced numerous legal challenges in adopting regulatory measures. Through 1993, the list of NESHAPS - national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants- stood at seven, and included the following chemicals: asbestos, beryllium, arsenic, mercury, benzene, vinyl chloride and radionuclides. 
<P>
In 1990, the new Federal Clean Air Act directed the EPA to control industrial emissions for 189 toxic chemicals with potential effects ranging from chronic respiratory effects to cancer to reproductive dysfunctions. The EPA must designate control-technology standards for 174 types of facilities that emit one or more of the 189 listed hazardous air pollutants. Standards for 39 sources were due by November, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#49">(49)</A> In some cases, EPA will establish the specific type of technology to be used to limit releases of pollutants; in others, industry will have flexibility in determining which type of technology they use to meet emission requirements.  
<P>
For those compounds not classified as criteria pollutants or with national emission standards (NESHAPs), air toxicologists and regulators at the TNRCC have conducted site-specific reviews of predicted or actual impacts for potential adverse effects. "Effects Screening Levels" (ambient air concentration guidelines, or ESLs) are used to gauge the potential of toxics air emissions associated with expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new facility to cause adverse health or welfare effects.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#50">(50)</A> 
<P>
Screening levels are set to protect against health effects, odor nuisance, effects on vegetation or corrosive effects, and are set to protect the more sensitive members of the general public. If, during the permit review process, the TNRCC determines that proposed emissions may result in exposure of the general public outside of the facility to concentrations of air pollutants at levels above these screening levels, the Commission may either deny the permit or require pollution control equipment as a permit provision.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#51">(51)</A> 
<P>
These health-based screening levels are controversial. Since each screening level is based upon the effects of a single chemical, simultaneous exposure to several air pollutants (each of which may have a similar effect on health) may not be adequately addressed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#52">(52)</A> The Toxicology and Risk Assessment Section at the TNRCC are aware of this potential for additive effects, but believe that the ESLs are conservative enough to protect against this effect in the vast majority of cases. In special cases, additional review is conducted as needed.
<P>
Another criticism is that ESLs do not address specifically the potential accumulation in the environment, over time, of compounds like DDTs, PCBs and metals. Although many toxics can degrade or be washed out of the environment in a short time, a few compounds are not readily degraded, and may accumulate in the tissue of lower organisms, then eventually in fish, birds and even mammals such as humans. In the review of impacts of these chemicals, this potential is considered.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#53">(53)</A> 
<P>
While Texas keeps an extensive air toxic emission inventory - how many pounds are actually emitted in the air - there is much less data on levels of toxics in the ambient air. In 1992, the TNRCC established the Community Air Toxics Monitoring Program, a network of 15 monitoring sites that will eventually expand to 50 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#54">(54)</A> The 15 sites have analyzed air samples for 19 volatile organic compounds. In both 1992 and 1993, benzene, a human carcinogen, was the only compound consistently detected at levels above the effects screening levels, and was detected at eight of the 15 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
The TNRCC determined, however, that the benzene measurements that exceeded the 24-hour ESLs would not increase the risk of short term adverse health effects. The TNRCC further concluded that, while long-term exposure to benzene at levels significantly greater than the annual ESL may increase the lifetime risk of developing leukemia or affect the formation of blood, measured levels of benzene have significantly decreased over the past 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#56">(56)</A> 
<P>
Benzene is a constituent of gasoline; it is released from cars during refueling and is a component of car exhaust. Benzene is also released during industrial refining processes and from benzene storage tanks. In Texas, the counties along the Gulf Coast have the greatest number of sources of benzene because of the large number of petrochemical companies and petroleum refineries.
<P>
Another compound - 1,2 dibromoethane - exceeded its screening levels at two sites in Houston, and at sites in El Paso and Midlothian during the monitoring period running from October 1992 through September 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#57">(57)</A> It is released to the atmosphere primarily through its use as a pesticide and as a fuel additive for gasoline. The manufacture of 1,2 dibromoethane has declined in recent years because its use as a fumigant has been banned and because the decline in lead-content of gasoline has resulted in a decline in its use as a fuel additive. While 24-hour concentrations did exceed the established ESL standards at these sites, they were not high enough to result in acute health effects according to TNRCC criteria. Nonetheless, yearly screening levels were exceeded.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#58">(58)</A>
<P>
The TNRCC, partly in response to legislative and citizen concerns about potential health effects of air toxics, has initiated special purpose studies at several sites around Texas. For example, after noticing high levels of arsenic in ambient air analyses in El Paso, the state initiated a special study in 1993 near the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). The Vilas Elementary School, about two miles southwest of the plant, was the site chosen for the study. The study showed that arsenic levels consistently exceeded both the annual and 24-hour screening levels. By comparing test results to levels measured when the ASARCO plant was shut down for a strike in 1980, the state concluded that the high arsenic levels were because of plant activity. During a permit hearing, the company agreed to reduce arsenic emissions by a factor of ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<A NAME="GREEN">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</A>
</H4>
<P>
One reason the earth is warm enough to support life is that carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere act as a kind of transparent umbrella, allowing sunlight to pass through, then trapping the heat below. This intricate but natural process is known as the greenhouse effect. 
<P>
With increased burning of coal, oil, and natural gas over the past century and with the destruction of much of the earth's forest cover, the greenhouse effect may be intensifying. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, some of which is used by trees and other vegetation during photosynthesis and some of which is absorbed by the oceans. When vast amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced and less is being used by plants, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. This accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (methane, ozone, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons) in earth's atmosphere may be causing the average temperature around the globe to rise, a phenomenon referred to as "global warming."
<P>
The environmental implications of global warming are serious. Higher average temperatures could hasten melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and distorting rainfall patterns. Coastal cities and plant and animal habitat could be destroyed. An alteration of climate could also reduce crop production. However, there may also be some benefits derived. 
<P>
Scientists like James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute, believe that the Earth is already experiencing an enhanced greenhouse effect. For example, six of the hottest years in recorded history occurred in the last decade.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#60">(60)</A> And studies have shown a correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a rise in global temperature.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#61">(61)</A>
<P>
There is considerable debate about the phenomenon of global warming. Critics like Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe while carbon dioxide accumulation may lead to warming climates, the actual impacts of warming will be mitigated by other factors. For instance, the increase in soot, sulfuric acid and particulate matter in the atmosphere, which help scatter light away from the earth, may be counteracting temperature increases that would otherwise occur from the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Still other scientists believe that temperature fluctuations are a normal occurence, attributable to such events as sun spots, and that techniques for measuring temperature are not accurate enough to permit scientists to design proper models of global temperature. Other scientists have developed climactic models which indicate a movement toward a severe cooling period. 
<P>
Overall, global temperatures have increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 130 years. But the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Meteorological Society have both projected that by the year 2050, the average surface temperature will increase an additional 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#62">(62)</A> The effects of these increases would be felt unevenly around the globe, with temperature changing less at the equator than at higher latitudes.
<P>
To delay or prevent global warming, world and national leaders have called for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, to be accomplished through a shift away from the use of oil, gas and coal and toward the use of more renewable energy sources like solar power.
<P>
In Texas, climatic changes predicted as a result of global warming could profoundly alter how Texans live and work. In Dallas, for example, if IPCC predictions are true, the number of days when the temperature reaches 100 degrees F could increase from 19 to 78 per year by 2050. In central Texas, average temperatures could go up five degrees during the same period.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#63">(63)</A> Water levels would also be affected. Rainfall would decline in most areas and the hotter temperatures would increase the rate of evaporation, resulting in a reduced water supply. Coastal areas would likely face more intense rainfall, however, as clouds forming from increased evaporation of ocean waters gave rise to more violent storms. Low-level areas along the coast would be subject to more flooding from increased rainfall and rising sea levels.
<P>
Texas may, however, also derive some positive benefits from warmer annual temperatures. One of these effects is that milder winters may reduce the risk of freezes which cripple citrus crops.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#64">(64)</A> 
<P>
Although there are currently no guidelines or limits in international law relating to greenhouse gases other than CFCs, there is growing awareness that the problem must be addressed. Many of the nations that are signatories to the Montreal Protocol are currently discussing the possibility of an international "law of the atmosphere" that would establish limits on the release of several greenhouse gases<B>.</B><A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
With only 5 percent of the world's population, the United States produces 23.4 percent of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels. Texas alone produces more carbon dioxide than either the United Kingdom or Canada.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#66">(66)</A> The state emitted an estimated 550 million metric tons in 1988 from all sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>

Texas depends heavily on fossil fuels both to power cars and to generate electricity. Texas utilities, for example, contributed 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1991, or about 30 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted. Without major changes in how Texas produces its energy, these levels are expected to continue. For a full discussion of energy use and energy policy in Texas, see the section entitled "Energy."

<OL>
	<LI>  Most of the sun's energy reaches the Earth.  (The ozone layer shields the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.) 
	<LI>  About 30 percent of the energy is reflected back into space. 
	<LI>  Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Added to this are chloroflourocarbons (man-made gases used in spray cans, refrigerants and insulations) and methane (from landfills, farming and swamps). 
	<LI>  Together, these gases form a "blanket" which traps energy, thus warming the Earth.

<A NAME="STRATO">DECREASING STRATOSPHERIC OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
Chlorinated fluorocarbons, or CFCs is the name given to a family of chemicals developed in 1928 by DuPont under the name Freon. Today, CFCs are used for refrigeration and air conditioning, as well as in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, computer chips, and many other products. When released into the air, these chemicals eventually rise to the stratosphere where they are broken down by sunlight. This degradation process releases chlorine, which damages the layer of atmospheric ozone that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet-B radiation. The destructive influence of CFCs high in the atmosphere is significant: a single chlorine atom can lead to the destruction of more than 100,000 ozone molecules.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#68">(68)</A>
<P>
Destruction of the ozone layer appears to be increasing. In the spring of 1985, British scientists found a hole about the size of the continental U.S. in the ozone layer over the Antarctica. This hole has reappeared each spring when meteorological conditions facilitate the breakdown in ozone. In 1992, satellite images recorded global ozone levels 4 percent lower than normal. Meanwhile, the concentration of CFCs measured in the atmo-sphere continues to climb.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#69">(69)</A> Use of other "ozone-depleters" like halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs) has also been on the rise.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#70">(70)</A> The high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth as a result of ozone depletion have been shown to increase the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. This radiation also adversely affects the environment. 
<P>
Because of the danger CFCs pose to the ozone layer, the Clean Air Act requires a phase-out of the production of CFCs and halons by the year 2000. Interim substitutes, such as HCFCs, will also be eventually phased out. In Texas, major industries still release millions of pounds of ten chemicals EPA has identified as ozone-depleters. Still, most CFCs do not come from industrial sources but rather from refrigerants, automobile air conditioning and solvents in oil-based paints.

<A NAME="INDOOR">INDOOR AIR POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The air we breathe indoors, whether at home, in our cars or at work, may represent a bigger pollution problem than outdoor air pollution. With people spending up to 90 percent of their time indoors, the quantity and severity of health problems related to indoor air quality has probably increased over the last 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#71">(71)</A> For example, in a December 1989 report, the EPA compared the risks of 20 different environmental problems and found that indoor air pollution posed the greatest health risk, though it had the least amount of federal money dedicated to it.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#72">(72)</A>
<P>
The severity of indoor air pollution is aggravated by the fact that new buildings are being built more tightly to save money spent on heating and cooling. Because these tightly sealed, more energy efficient buildings prevent the exchange of outside/inside air, they reduce the amount of fresh air in a building. At the same time, people are using more and more irritating products such as hair sprays, pesticides and cleaning detergents. The combination of a lack of ventilation and heavy use of such materials can be dangerous. In Texas, the Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch is responsible for responding to indoor air-quality complaints, providing on-site investigations, educating the public about indoor air quality health problems and suggesting methods to alleviate indoor air quality problems.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> During FY 1992, the Texas Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch received over 3,000 requests for information, responded to indoor air-quality complaints from 124 schools, buildings and residences, and performed more than 257 on-site investigations, including 130 private residences. For more information, please call the Occupational Health Division at the Department of Health at 512-834-6600.

<P>
The American Lung Association has estimated that indoor air pollution costs businesses over $100 billion dollars a year because of death, sick days, direct medical costs, loss of productivity and damage to materials and equipment. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that 3,500 to 6,500 deaths a year are the result of the effects of indoor air pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#73">(73)</A> The causes of these deaths include cancer and coronary heart disease caused by exposure to radon, paints, solvents and second-hand tobacco smoke. 
<P>
Indoor air pollution is suspected to be one of the leading causes of health problems largely because of seven pollutants: environmental tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, radon, microorganisms, pesticides, asbestos and lead. In 1989, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly asked an independent team of scientists known as the Science Advisory Board to assess and compare different environmental risks using recent scientific data. The group found that indoor air quality problems from environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, radon and six volatile organic compounds often found indoors in solvents, paints and gasoline products represented one of four problems posing "relatively high human health risks."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#74">(74)</A>
<P>
Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is responsible for an estimated 10 percent of lung cancer deaths. This colorless, odorless gas occurs everywhere at low levels, but it becomes a concern when it is trapped in buildings with little ventilation. Radon gas may enter homes built on soils or rocks containing high levels of uranium, which is the most common source of the gas, or through cracks or other openings in basements or ground floors. Studies by the EPA indicate that as many as 10 percent of U.S. homes may have elevated radon levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#75">(75)</A> A 1992 study by the TDH monitored indoor air for radon in about 2,700 homes across Texas. The TDH found four areas with a high potential for radon: the West Texas Panhandle Region; the Big Bend area; the Llano Uplift area; and inland from the coastal bend in South Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
Microorganisms - bacteria, viruses and fungi - can cause serious illnesses such as Legionnaire's Disease, asthma, influenza and other infectious diseases.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#77">(77)</A> These microorganisms can grow in humid buildings, as well as in bedding or the litter of household pets, and without proper ventilation, can easily infect occupants. More subtle health effects, commonly known as "sick building syndrome," include headaches, irritation of eyes, nose and respiratory tract, loss of memory, fatigue and drowsiness. An EPA survey of office workers across the nation found that 19 percent of respondents sometimes had difficulty performing work because of poor indoor air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#78">(78)</A>
<P>
Indoor exposure to pesticides, asbestos and lead all affect human health, particularly the health of young children. The practice of sanding or open-flame burning of lead-based paints, which were in common use before 1978, emits compounds that can impair mental and physical development in both fetuses and young children. Using 1990 census data, the EPA determined that 3.5 million homes in Texas contain some lead-based paint. Based upon these figures, the EPA estimates that 1,949,696 children six years old or under have the potential to be exposed to lead poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Pesticides in the home or office can irritate eyes, nose and throat and may damage the central nervous system or may even lead to an increased risk of cancer. According to an EPA survey, nine out of ten U.S. households have used pesticides.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#80">(80)</A> Chlordane, dieldrin and other chemicals used to kill termites have been banned or their indoor use severely restricted in part because they remain active for such long periods. Also, several types of asbestos products, made from a mineral fiber used as an insulator and fire-retardant, have been banned by the EPA because they can cause chest and lung cancer as well as a condition known as asbestosis, an irreversible lung scarring which can be fatal.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#81">(81)</A> Elevated concentrations of asbestos can occur indoors when asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by remodeling or demolition activities.

<P>
Today's automobile produces approximately 90<B> </B>percent less pollution than cars built in the 1960s.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#82">(82)</A> Leaded gasoline has been phased out, and government-mandated manufacturing improvements, like the catalytic converter and the fuel injector, have significantly reduced tailpipe emissions. However, the benefits of these improvements have been largely offset by several factors: a rapid expansion in the number of cars on the roads, an increase in the number of miles driven each day and changes in the composition of gasoline. (As lead has been phased out, refineries have made up for the loss in octane with changes in the gasoline formula that make auto fuel more likely to release smog-forming VOCs into the air.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#83">(83)</A>) As a result, motor vehicle use still contributes significantly to air pollution, accounting for a quarter of the CFCs in the air, 70 percent of the carbon monoxide and more than a third of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides emitted in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, vehicles also account for 24 percent of all air toxics, and most of the air-borne cancer-causing compounds like butadiene and benzene.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#85">(85)</A> When toxic emissions from service stations, auto body shops and the gasoline refinery and tire manufacturing industries are added in, motor vehicles' contribution to toxic emissions in Texas climbs to 45 percent.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#86">(86)</A>
<P>
There are three obvious ways to reduce pollution from cars: produce lower-emission vehicles, reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled and convert vehicles to cleaner, alternative fuels like natural gas, propane and electricity. 
<P>
The Federal Clean Air Act requires states to develop a plan to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with national air quality standards. These plans must include a mobile sources component. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has submitted a plan to the Environmental Protection Agency for the state's four ozone non-attainment areas: El Paso, Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Dallas/Fort Worth and Beaumont/Port Arthur.

<tr><th>NEW HIGHWAY VEHICLE PROGRAMS MANDATED BY CLEAN AIR ACT OF 1990 - INCLUDED IN TEXAS' STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
REFORMULATED FUEL: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria. Use fuels that are 15 percent cleaner (1995). Use fuels that are 25 percent cleaner (2000). Fuel distributors must sell gasoline that has been reformulated to produce lower hydrocarbon emissions, increasing fuel costs by 3 to 5 cents per gallon in affected areas.
<P>
OXYGENATED FUEL: El Paso. Use fuels with 2.7 percent oxygen content during "high CO" season (1992). Gasoline sold between October 1 and March 31 must have a minimum oxygen content of 2.7 percent. El Paso's program has reduced carbon monoxide emissions by 17 percent with minimal effect on fuel prices.
<P>
TEXAS ALTERNATIVE FUEL FLEET PROGRAM: Non-attainment areas. A percentage of new vehicles in commercial fleets must meet clean-fueled vehicle standards (30 percent by 1998, 50 percent-1999, 70 percent-2000). Applies to private/commercial and government fleets with 15 or more vehicles. Alternative fuels may include CNG, LNG, ethanol, methanol or electric. Legislation has expanded this to any fuel that can be used to meet the standards, including reformulated fuels.
<P>
VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE: Non-attainment areas. High-tech emissions testing, evaporative system checks (General public, 1995). Applies to all gasoline powered vehicles registered or operating in the non-attainment areas. Odd model year vehicles test in odd years, even model in even years. Legislation allowing the Governor to negotiate greater consumer convenience and flexibility has recently passed.
<P>
EMPLOYER TRIP REDUCTION: Houston. Employers must adopt plans to reduce work-related trips by 25 percent (Submit plans, 1994; compliance, 1996) Program modifications are being considered to provide market-based incentives and minimize employer compliance liability.

<A NAME="TIGHT"><H4>TIGHTER TAILPIPE EMISSION STANDARDS 
</A></H4><P>
Cutting emissions from auto tailpipes may be the most direct method to reduce air pollution. The Pechan Study, sponsored by the Northeastern States for Coordinated Air Use Management, concluded that cutting emissions from mobile sources is more economical than reducing emissions from industry. Of course this relationship does not hold for all industries and all areas. But in areas of Texas where mobile sources contribute significantly more VOCs and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere than industries do, reducing vehicle emissions may be the most economical way to fight urban pollution.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#87">(87)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  According to a recent study, cutting smog-forming pollution from vehicles costs about $500 per ton through a vehicle-emissions program; reducing the same amount of pollution in major industries costs from $2,000 to $10,000 per ton, according to the EPA.

<P>
Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, pollution-control equipment (fuel injectors and catalytic converters) on all 1994 cars must last for 100,000 miles, rather than the 50,000 miles required by previous Federal Clean Air Acts. In addition, engines for diesel trucks must be designed to reduce particulate releases by 90 percent. Buses will have to make similar reductions. Finally, the Act requires the automobile industry to produce vehicles that emit 35 to 50 percent less VOCs, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide than current vehicles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#88">(88)</A> At least 500,000 of these Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) must be manufactured for sale in California by 1999.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#89">(89)</A> New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Maine are considering requiring the sale of these vehicles to meet ozone standards.

New regulations adopted by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission require that, beginning September 1998, an increasing percentage of all vehicles bought or leased by all mass transit and all other fleets with 15 or more vehicles must meet or exceed the LEV tailpipe emissions standards. By 2002, 90 percent of all new vehicle purchases must meet these standards. The program affects all private and public fleets in three non-attainment areas: El Paso, Houston/Galveston/Brazoria and Beaumont/Port Arthur. To meet these standards, vehicles can either use alternative fuels such as propane, natural gas, ethanol, methanol, or electricity, reformulated gasoline or diesel fuels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#90">(90)</A>

An alternative measure that would directly reduce vehicle emissions would be to reduce the number of vehicles driven and miles traveled. In the 1980s, urban traffic grew more than roadway capacity throughout the country, leading to congested traffic. The traditional response to traffic congestion has been to build more highways. But this expansion inevitably provides an incentive for more people to drive cars and encourages increases in vehicle miles traveled.

<P>
Both the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act and the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) have emphasized transportation planning that encourages car-pooling and the use of public transportation. ISTEA, if fully funded, will funnel an additional $385 million in federal funds to Texas each year between 1992 and 1997. Moreover, the ISTEA-required planning process relies heavily on local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to help distribute these funds. Each MPO must certify that its use of federal funds will result in fewer emissions or better air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#91">(91)</A> Still, the Texas Department of Transportation estimates that only 5 percent of federal, state and local highway funds is being specifically earmarked to mitigate congestion and improve air quality. 
<P>
Texas has more motor vehicles than any state except for California, and in Texas, as in the nation as a whole, the number of cars driven and miles traveled have grown exponentially in recent decades.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#92">(92)</A> With more than 18 million cars registered to Texas drivers, traffic congestion has become a problem in cities all over Texas. Congestion causes travel delays and wastes fuel. It also decreases fuel efficiency and increases dangerous vehicle emissions. In Houston, traffic grew by 75 percent between 1970 and 1980. In 1990, Houston was among the 10 most congested cities in the U.S.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#93">(93)</A> The TNRCC notes that increased traffic speeds monitored in recent years suggests congestion improvements.

The Federal Clean Air Act mandates an Employer Trip Reduction (ETR) Program in severe and extreme non-attainment areas. This program requires employers with more than 100 employees at a worksite to offer those employees incentives to stop driving to and from work alone. In Houston, total miles driven in commuting trips must be reduced and passenger occupancy increased by 25 percent through ETR efforts. The Legislature recently approved a six-month delay in the program to help make it more flexible.

<A NAME="PUSHING">PUSHING FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS
</A></H4>
<P>
A third way to reduce pollution from cars is to change to cleaner-burning fuels. Recognizing Texas' vast potential as an "alternative energy" state, the Texas Legislature created its own "plan" for alternative fuels by passing legislation in 1989.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#94">(94)</A> The legislation requires state agencies, school districts with more than 50 buses and all mass transit authorities to purchase only those new vehicles capable of running on alternative fuels. By September 1, 1994, state agencies and mass transit authorities must have converted 30 percent of their fleets to alternative fuel. By 1996, 50 percent must be converted and by 1998, 90 percent. School districts have a slightly more flexible schedule: by September 1, 1997, 50 percent of their buses must be converted and 90 percent must be using an approved alternative fuel by 2001. Private fleets of more than 15 vehicles in Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, El Paso and Beaumont/Port Arthur are subject to these same requirements as part of the state's plan to meet the Clean Air Act. By 1998, 30 percent of the vehicles are required to use alternative fuels. 
<P>
The alternative fuels currently approved for use in Texas by the TNRCC are: natural gas, liquid petroleum gas (propane), methanol, ethanol and electricity. Industry groups and some legislators have proposed including both low-sulfur diesel and reformulated gasoline as alternative fuels. Under a revised plan not yet approved by the EPA, the TNRCC will allow use of these fuels for local governments, private fleets and smaller school districts providing they meet tough emission standards.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#95">(95)</A> The certification of alternative-fueled vehicles to specific low emission vehicle standards is necessary to quantify emission reductions. 
<P>
Alternative fuels have two advantages over conventional fuels: price and cleanliness. One disadvantage is that alternative-fuel vehicles cannot travel as far without refueling. For example, a gasoline-fueled vehicle able to travel 100 miles would only travel 85 miles on propane and 31 miles on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) because the alternative fuels have lower energy content.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#96">(96)</A> However, improvements in automobile manufacturing technologies are increasing gas mileage for propane, methanol and natural gas vehicles.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  A test conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency on a propane-fueled car revealed that net carbon monoxide emissions were 93 percent less, hydrocarbons 73 percent less and nitrogen oxides 53 percent less than federal emission standards for gasoline. 
	<P><I> Source: Information provided by Alternative Fuels Division, Texas Railroad Commission, Alternative Fuels Research and Education Division.</I>

</UL>
<P>
<P>
New technology alternative-fueled vehicles can be substantially cleaner than today's gasoline-powered vehicles. Compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered vehicles are cleaner because they use a closed-loop system - there is no evaporation or escape of uncombusted gas before it reaches the tailpipe. A diesel-fueled bus emits as much particulate matter as 500 natural gasoline-powered automobiles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#97">(97)</A>
<P>
Propane - or Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) - is another cleaner burning alternative fuel. Like CNG, the fuel system in a propane-powered vehicle is a closed-loop system, meaning there are no evaporative emissions. In addition, propane-powered vehicles emit even less nitrogen oxides than vehicles using natural gas. Another significant advantage of both CNG and propane use is that both fuels eliminate the need for underground storage tanks. Texas has had nearly 15,000 reported cases of leaks from petroleum underground storage tanks - leaks that often contaminate soil and water.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#98">(98)</A>
<P>
Several companies in Texas have been promoting electric vehicle (EV) technology. Electrosource, an Austin-based company, is developing a lead-acid electric battery that is expected to last 50,000 miles. The battery would also allow cars to travel between 100 and 150 miles before recharging.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#99">(99)</A> The Chrysler Corporation plans to test the new electric battery on a fleet of mini-vans. Still, the limited number of miles these vehicles can travel before recharging and the time needed to recharge are obstacles to their widespread acceptance.
<P>
The conversion of vehicles to alternative fuels might be beneficial to the Texas economy, which sits atop 27.5 percent of known natural gas reserves in the continental U.S.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#100">(100)</A> Initially viewed by the oil industry as a costly waste product, natural gas has now become an important source of energy in Texas and the world. Propane is the most widely used alternative fuel in Texas, the U.S. and the world, and Texas produces more propane than any other state. More than 60 percent of propane comes from natural gas production; the remainder is derived from crude oil during the refining process. Texas oil and natural gas refineries produced about 5.6 billion gallons of propane in 1992.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#101">(101)</A> 
<P>
Most propane is used as a raw material in the production process at petrochemical plants; however, about 10 percent is used for transportation fuel. Farmers and ranchers in Texas have long relied on propane to fuel agricultural vehicles and rural Texans have used it for heating and cooking for some 50 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#102">(102)</A>
<P>
At present, the major obstacles to the use of alternative fuels is the lack of an infrastructure for distributing them to consumers, and a range limitation considering the distances between towns in West Texas and the Panhandle. Unlike regular gasoline or diesel fuels, there is not a CNG refueling station on every corner. As of April 1994, Texas had 73 filling stations for natural gas refueling and about 1,200 propane refueling stations.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#103">(103)</A> 
<P>
Another obstacle to the use of alternative fuels is the cost of converting old vehicles to run on an alternative fuel. The price tag for converting an average car to propane, which includes replacement of the fuel system and installation of new electronics, is about $2,000.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#104">(104)</A> Ford officials have estimated that natural gas vehicles currently cost $3,500 to $6,000 more to manufacture than conventional vehicles. In 1983, the Garland Independent School District invested $241,000 to convert 65 school buses and 12 support vehicles to natural gas and to install refueling facilities. This expenditure aver-aged out to about $3,500 per vehicle. In general, it is cheaper to convert a vehicle to propane than to natural gas. Despite these conversions costs, converting vehicles may be economical for some fleets in the long run because propane and natural gas are cheaper than gasoline and because maintenance costs are generally lower over a 3- to 5-year period. The city of Garland saved more than $100,000 in the first two years alone in fuel and maintenance costs.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#105">(105)</A>

</UL>
<P>
Since alternative fuels legislation went into effect in 1991, about 80 percent of the vehicles that have converted to alternative fuels have converted to propane.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#106">(106)</A> As of July, 1994, there were 30,453 alternative fuel vehicles registered with the Comptroller's Motor Fuel Tax Section. This total does not include several thousand alternative-fueled vehicles operated by counties and school districts, which are not taxed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#107">(107)</A> At present, 39 school districts are using propane to fuel their vehicles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#108">(108)</A>

In 1993, 100 facilities in Texas emitted more than 18,000 tons of particulate matter, 924,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 746,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, 169,000 tons of VOCs, and 455,000 tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#109">(109)</A> Together, these 100 facilities produced more criteria pollutants than the total produced by the remaining 5,900 facilities reporting to the state's "Emissions Inventory."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#110">(110)</A> In 1990, the major industries in Texas also released more air toxics than any other state. By 1992, Louisiana had the highest amount of total toxic releases, but Texas had the highest amount of toxic air releases, totaling 157.5 million pounds of some 300 chemicals.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#111">(111)</A> However, between 1987 and 1993, total releases of air toxics in Texas declined by 40 percent, from 236.8 to 141.9 million pounds.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#112">(112)</A>
<P>
For these reasons -  the emission of criteria air pollutants and toxics - these industrial facilities, which the Federal Clean Air Act calls "major stationary sources," are often the focus of state and citizen efforts to reduce air pollution. In fact, major industry bears the administrative burden of obtaining permits and, particularly in the non-attainment areas, must reduce emissions significantly. This section takes a look at three categories of major-stationary-source air pollution: manufacturing, combustion and mechanical facilities. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  Despite the large amount of effort spent by the state in issuing permits, violations of permits and state air quality regulations are fairly common. In the ten year period between September 1982 and August 1992, there were more than 23,000 violations issued by the Texas Air Control Board. Over this period, around 3,400 violations were for failure to obtain a permit prior to construction or operation of a facility.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#113">(113)</A> Other common violations included nuisance violations, violating the conditions of a permit, creating a traffic hazard, failing to report upset air emissions and violating federal toxics emission standards. Most of these toxic emission standard violations were violations of the asbestos demolition or renovation standards which did not result in significant air emissions.

<A NAME="PERMIT">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>WHO MUST OBTAIN A PERMIT IN TEXAS?</TH></TR><TR><TD>
One way the state of Texas regulates air emissions is through a permitting process. Under the Texas Clean Air Act of 1971, most new or expanding industries that will emit air contaminants must obtain a permit from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission before any construction is begun. Such permits require that the facility install "best available control technology." Some facilities are exempt from the pre-construction permit requirement if they meet conditions set out in the state's "standard exemption" list, which covers small businesses like dry cleaners, auto body shops and paint shops.
<P>
As of April 1994, Texas had issued 20,928 state permits in both attainment and non-attainment areas. Some 14,000 are still active.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#114">(114)</A> This construction permitting process is divided into non-attainment review for sources located in non-attainment areas and prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) review in attainment areas. Permits in non-attainment areas are generally more stringent. It is important to note that air pollution sources which were operating before 1972 and have not expanded are not required to have a state permit; these are known as "grandfathered" facilities. 
<P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act created a new category of permits: operating permits. These permits are required of all major stationary sources which emit air pollutants. The purpose of federal operating permits is to codify all applicable requirements at a site and provide an enforcement and compliance tool. For example, a petroleum refinery operation may have 100 to 200 different rules, regulations, permits and variances governing the operation of their facility. A Title V permit would codify them all. Thus, construction permits would be incorporated into an operating permit. The TNRCC projects that there will be 8,100 federal operating permits issued at some 3,000 sites in Texas during the five years after the Texas program receives EPA approval.

<A NAME="MANU">MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' major industries are concentrated along the Gulf Coast and in major metropolitan areas like Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, San Antonio and Austin. The amount and type of pollution varies widely by region. For example, Corpus Christi's major industries - oil and gas refineries, pipelines, and chemical companies - contribute an estimated 41 percent of total volatile organic compounds and 62 percent of nitrogen oxides emitted in the Corpus Christi area every day. In Austin, major industries - mainly electronics manufacturers - only contribute 1 percent of the area's total VOC emissions and 14 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#115">(115)</A> Not surprisingly, much of the concern over industrial air pollution has been along the Gulf Coast.
<P>
Toxic air emissions from these industries are a major concern of citizen groups around the state. Federal law requires manufacturing industries with more than nine employees to submit data on releases of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 chemical compounds. Harris, Jefferson and Galveston counties are among the top ten emitters of toxics per year in the country.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#116">(116)</A> 
<P>
Many of these toxics have been linked to both cancer and birth defects. In 1992, the chemicals known to cause, or suspected of causing birth defects - categorized as either developmental toxins or heritable mutagens by the EPA - which were released into the environment in the greatest amount included toluene, xylene, methyl ketone and trichloroethylene. Most of these releases were through the air.
<P>
There are, at present, no state or federal regulations specifying acceptable ambient concentrations for air toxics, as there are for the criteria pollutants. For example, only one of the top 15 toxic chemicals released in Texas, benzene, has been the subject of a national air quality standard. By comparison, five of these 15 toxic chemicals have maximum contaminent level standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#117">(117)</A> However, the air permitting requirement that new permitted facilities use best available control technology (BACT) limits toxic emissions considerably. Also, the 1990 Clean Air Act will impose new standards on industries identified as sources of 189 major toxic compounds. In addition, the TNRCC has developed a system to evaluate concentrations of more than 1,500 chemicals, including the top 15 toxic chemicals, emitted by permitted facilities. Guideline concentrations called ESLs, previously described, are used to evaluate not only proposed emissions but also ambient air monitoring data. 
<P>
Toxic air emissions reported to both the state's Emissions Inventory as well as under the Toxics Release Inventory Program do not include "upset" emissions. Defined as accidental, unplanned air pollution releases, thousands of upsets a year contribute pollutants to the state's atmosphere. Under state regulations, companies are required to report their upsets to the TNRCC. But the information in these reports is sketchy: a 1992 Sierra Club survey of upset emissions in nine Texas counties revealed that companies do not always report or even know in some cases how much or what type of chemical was emitted.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#118">(118)</A> According to this study, of 8,857 upset reports in 1991, 80 percent did not list the quantity of compound released, and 38 percent did not report the type of chemical released.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#119">(119)</A> Such accidents and failure or inability to report accurate upset emissions make it extremely difficult to assess the full impact of industrial toxic emissions on public health. In addition, because the state does not set levels or limits on upset emissions - by definition they are unplanned events - the data these reports do contain are not used to help set emission limits.

<P>
A second category of major stationary sources is made up of facilities that burn material for energy, waste disposal or both. Utilities, waste incinerators, industrial boilers and cement kiln facilities are the major examples. Because these facilities burn materials at very high temperatures, they emit chemicals and gases that sometimes result in dangerous chemical reactions. For example, sulfur dioxide is one of the principal compounds emitted from electric utilities. When hot, a small portion of sulfur dioxide emissions can combine with oxygen to form sulfates, which in turn can combine with water particles to form sulfuric acid. This acid falls to the earth as acid rain.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#120">(120)</A> Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which contribute to the formation of acid rain, and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are the major pollutants resulting from combustion. Heavy metals are also emitted by some combustion facilities. Coal-burning facilities can emit mercury and cadmium. Cement kilns and incinerators for hazardous waste and municipal waste can all emit chromium, manganese and lead.

Texas has 27 major electric utilities operating 312 generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#121">(121)</A> About half of the state's electricity is derived from coal, about 40 percent comes from natural gas, and the remainder comes from hydroelectric power, nuclear power and renewable energy sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#122">(122)</A> Electric utilities that use coal as their combustible material pump millions more tons of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than do those using natural gas or a combination of petroleum and natural gas.
<P>
In 1990, the generation of electric power produced 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide and 66 percent of all the sulfur dioxide emitted in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#123">(123)</A> In fact, the four facilities in Texas which released the largest volume of criteria pollutants are all coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#124">(124)</A> Emissions from power plants contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. 
<P>
Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, in order to combat acid rain formation, sulfur dioxide emissions must be reduced by 10 million tons below 1980 levels and nitrogen oxide emissions must be cut by 2 million tons by the year 2000. In a first phase, the nation's largest 110 utilities (none of them located in Texas) must achieve the greatest share of sulfur dioxide reduction by the end of 1995. In a second phase, all other major utilities, including those in Texas, must reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. The Clean Air Act also caps the amount of sulfur dioxide utilities can emit in 2000, and places controls on nitrogen oxide emissions as well. Major utilities in Texas will soon be required to continuously monitor and report their emissions and, like major industries, will also be required to obtain a federal operating permit.
<P>
Waste incinerators are another source of combustion-generated air pollutants. Both municipalities and industries sometimes incinerate a variety of waste as a means to reduce their volume and to generate energy. Public opposition to such facilities expressed at permit hearings has raised awareness about the air pollution that can result from these facilities, particularly hazardous waste incinerators, which burn waste that are defined as hazardous because they are toxic, flammable, corrosive and/or reactive. There are currently 32 permitted hazardous waste incinerators in Texas. Harris County, with 13 facilities, has more hazardous waste facili-ties than any other county in the United States. Jefferson County, with five, is among the top ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#125">(125)</A> These facilities are operated by large corporations, chiefly to dispose of their own waste. Three of the facilities presently operating in Texas are commercial waste incinerators, accepting liquid waste from both in-state and out-of-state generators.
<P>
Cement plants are combustion facilities on a smaller scale. Some burn hazardous waste to fire their kilns. In 1991, citizen groups in Midlothian, near Dallas, expressed concerns about health effects from the burning of hazardous waste in cement kilns and the dumping of cement-kiln ash in quarries. Two of the three cement kiln plants in the Midlothian area were burning waste-derived fuels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#126">(126)</A> A third had previously burned tires to generate energy and was seeking a permit to continue burning them. Responding to citizen concerns, the Texas Air Control Board monitored community air for particulate matter, metals, sulfur compounds, air toxics and other compounds. Monitors were located downwind of the major facilities in the area. Tests conducted over a two-year period indicated that no adverse health effects are expected to result from exposure to the monitored levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#127">(127)</A>

Industries that rely on mechanical processes include: metal smelters, grain elevators, foundries, steel manufacturers, wood processors, cotton gins, asphalt batching operations, concrete and cement batching operations, paper mills, sand blasting operations and oil and gas rigs. These industries are another major category of stationary sources that can pollute the air. Cotton gins, for example, may lead to heavy emissions of particulate matter. In 1990, air sampled around a cotton gin in the Lower Rio Grande Valley showed respirable particulate matter was being emitted in high levels, although not in violation of standards applicable to agricultural sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#128">(128)</A> Lead smelters are of particular concern to citizens living near them and to environ- mental groups. As an air pollutant, lead is emitted in particles so small that 50 percent might remain in the lungs if breathed by humans.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#129">(129)</A> However, tests conducted by the Texas Air Control Board in response to citizen complaints found that levels of lead in the ambient air near the smelters were below national air quality standards.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#130">(130)</A> Any lead smelters built after 1987 must be at least 3,000 feet from the nearest residence.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#131">(131)</A>

<A NAME="AREA"><H4>AREA SOURCES</A>
</H4>

"Area sources" are small, stationary sources that usually do not emit large amounts of criteria pollutants or toxics. Most of these sources will not require a federal operating permit at this time. However, the EPA will eventually require all such area sources to obtain a federal operating permit. Important area sources include dry cleaners, printers, machine shops, service stations, wastewater treatment plants, auto painting, repair shops and consumers who use household consumer items. While these "small" businesses and consumer activities individually do not contribute large amounts of pollution to the atmosphere, taken collectively they emit more of some types of pollutants than do some individual large industries. For example, area sources account for 58 percent of all toxic emissions in Texas, or about three times as much as large industries combined, although emissions do not occur in the concentrations they do with major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#132">(132)</A> In many cities in Texas, area sources contribute more VOCs to smog formation than do major stationary sources.
<P>
For these reasons, the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act broadened the scope of federal regulation to include areas sources. The Federal Clean Air Act has had an immediate impact on small busi-ness owners.

<P>
<P>
Even with the increased regulations, most small businesses will not be required to get a state permit. Instead, new businesses will simply have to meet the provisions of the state's standard exemption list and any general permit developed as part of the federal operating permit program. The standard exemption specifies requirements or conditions, including installation of pollution control equipment, that will allow a business to comply with air-quality laws without going through the costly permit process. In some cases, such as cement plants and asphalt plants, a standard exemption must be applied for and issued by the state. In other cases, the exemption can just be claimed by a business, which must then be prepared, if asked, to demonstrate its conformity with the conditions of the exemption.

<tr><th>HOW DOES THE FCAA IMPACT SMALL BUSINESS?
</TH></TR><TR><TD>The Federal Clean Air Act is likely to impact more than 55,000 businesses in Texas with fewer than 100 employees. Over the next five to seven years, the Environmental Protection Agency will be developing specific rules for small businesses to reduce their generation of toxic waste, their use of ozone-depleting chemicals and, in non-attainment areas, their emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. While these regulations are still being formulated, the EPA has pinpointed 23 industries it is most likely to regulate in the next five years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#133">(133)</A> 
<P>
The state estimated costs for the approximately 20,593 small businesses most likely to be affected by the Federal Clean Air Act -  and for which reliable cost data was available - to be more than $1 billion, most of it for capital equipment, to comply with Federal Clean Air Act regulations over the next five years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#134">(134)</A> In the four non-attainment areas alone, the cost to businesses for obtaining a federal operating permit and installing pollution control equipment is expected to total $505 million. All existing sources, regardless of location, that emit more than 10 tons per year of any of the 189 toxic pollutants or 25 tons per year of any combination of these 189 chemicals for which the EPA is developing rules must install control technology which is at least equivalent to the average of the top 12 percent for that industry. New sources must install the best proven technology for that industry.

<A NAME="AGRI">SPECIAL CASE: AGRICULTURE</A>
</H4>
<P>
While much of the concern about air pollution is focused on industrial and urban sources, people living in rural areas can also face nuisance odors and toxic air pollution. Air-borne pesticides are a concern in some rural areas. A recent study estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of pesticides sprayed from crop dusters reach their intended source. The remaining 85 to 90 percent can drift up to 20 miles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#135">(135)</A> (For a full discussion of pesticides use and their health effects in Texas, see the section entitled Pesticides).
<P>
Other agricultural activities that can result in emissions of air contaminants such as odors and particulate matter include cotton gins, cotton seed oil mills, hide tanning, seed cleaning, sugar mills, sugar cane and crop residue burning, feed-mills, smokehouses and concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs. CAFOs are areas in which animals such as poultry, hogs or cows are concentrated in a relatively small area for egg-laying, stabling, sleeping, milking or feeding purposes. Sometimes, animal waste from these operations is collected in ponds, which can release both odors and methane gas (one of the greenhouse gases). Other animal waste is placed in manure mounds or applied as fertilizer to the land, which also can lead to odor nuisances. CAFOs and other agricultural activities are more likely to contribute air pollutants such as particulate matter to the atmosphere during hot, dry weather. For example, feedlot dust can result when cattle activity increases around dusk. Odor problems, on the other hand, usually occur following significant precipitation.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#136">(136)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  Anaerobic treatment of livestock waste accounts for 6 percent to 10 percent of the total methane emissions from human-related activities in Texas.

</UL>
<P>
Large CAFOs are typically required to obtain air permits, while smaller CAFOs are usually exempt from the permitting process. Regardless of size, all CAFOs must be operated in a manner that does not result in either dust or nuisance odor problems. While quantitative measurement standards for odors have not been developed, odors from CAFOs in rural areas are a controversial issue.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#137">(137)</A> Numerous odor and dust complaints have been filed with the field offices of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission over the years. If the TNRCC confirms an odor or dust problem either in response to a citizen complaint or as a result of investigation it can issue a notice of violation. If the problem is not corrected after the notice of violation, the state can begin formal enforcement action, which may include administrative fines. 
<P>
However, the perception and reaction to an odor can be highly subjective, and different field offices have interpreted the authority to issue notices of violation differently. Because of recent court cases concerning the regulation of CAFOs and because of the complexities often surrounding alleged nuisance conditions associated with these types of operations, new policies are being developed to assure consistency in the TNRCC's regulatory process.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 7, Texas Energy, Page 1
</H5>
<A NAME="TEXAS">American</A> Indians were the first to utilize Texas' vast energy resources. In addition to the wood they harvested from the state's immense forests, the Lipan Apache, Comanches and Kiowas used dried buffalo dung for heating and cooking. Archaeological records show tribal groups along the coast used naturally occurring tar to seal their baskets. They also used the thick oil that seeped from the ground to put handles on their tools and affix dart points to their arrows. Archaeological sites near Lake Lewisville show the first Texas settlers collected and burned lignite some 8,000 years before the arrival of Europeans.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#1">(1)</A> 
<P>
Coal was the first fossil fuel used by white settlers. Surface supplies were used throughout the early 1800s and mining of coal began in the 1850s. Coal continues to be an integral part of Texas' energy mix. Over the past two decades, the state has produced 652 million tons of soft coal (also called lignite), the equivalent of 1.5 billion barrels of oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#2">(2)</A> Texas is the sixth largest producer of coal in the U.S. and the state has only begun to mine this vast resource. More than 24 billion tons of lignite still lie beneath the surface. 
<P>
Since the state's first big oil discovery at Spindletop in 1901, Texas has produced 54 billion barrels of oil, providing trillions of dollars in tax revenues to state government and thousands of jobs to residents. Texas oil was a critical ingredient in the Allied war effort in World War II. The "Big Inch" and "Little Big Inch" pipelines carried much-needed Texas petroleum to industrial facilities on the East Coast. From there, Texas oil was shipped to Europe for use by Allied forces. 
<P>
The Texas energy industry has survived periods of boom and bust. In 1929, Texas was the biggest oil-producing province in the world. By 1930, high-grade oil was selling for $1.10 per barrel (42 gallons). But the following year, the market fell apart. The huge East Texas Field near Kilgore began producing a million barrels of oil per day, far more than the market could absorb. Prices plummeted and Texas oil was selling for just 10 cents a barrel.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#3">(3)</A> The problems of oversupply and disarray in the market forced the state to take action, and in 1932, the state legislature authorized the Railroad Commission of Texas to limit oil production.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#4">(4)</A> By setting limits on the amount of oil that each field could produce, the Commission was able to prevent floods of oil from coming onto the market. But the Railroad Commission has not been able to insulate the industry from price upheavals. Another boom in the early 1980s caused a surge in oil drilling, which fell apart four years later. 
<P>
The 1980s were not kind to the oil industry. Nationwide, nearly half a million Americans lost jobs in the oil industry. More jobs were lost in the energy business than in the steel and auto industries combined. In Texas, between 1981 and 1992, 24 refineries closed, the number of active drilling rigs declined from 1,300 to 209 and 160,000 Texans lost jobs in the oil and gas sector.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#5">(5)</A> In 1981, the oil and gas industry accounted for 25 percent of the gross state product. By 1993, it had fallen by more than half, to 12 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#6">(6)</A> By the year 2015, oil and gas is expected to account for less than 8 percent of the gross state product.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#7">(7)</A> 
<P>
State tax revenues from oil have also fallen. During the 1950s the state routinely got a third of its tax revenue from oil and gas taxes. Today, the state gets less than 7 percent of total revenues from oil and gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#8">(8)</A>
<P>
With 17 million residents, Texas has about 7 percent of the U.S. population, but in 1989, the state accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total energy usage. Texas consumes more electricity, natural gas, coal and petroleum than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#9">(9)</A> 
<P>
Today, the Texas energy industry is at a cross- roads. Oil production in the state is falling. Natural gas consumption is increasing but reserves are shrinking. Coal use has risen sharply. For the first time, Texas faces the prospect of becoming a net energy importer. The state whose vast oil resources once played a critical role in national defense may soon be dependent on other states and foreign countries to meet demand.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#10">(10)</A> 
<P>
Much of the state's energy demand comes from its huge appetite for electricity. Electricity demand in the state is now growing at about 2.5 percent per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#11">(11)</A> More than half the new electricity coming on-line will be generated by coal-fired power plants, with one-third of the coal coming from Wyoming.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
<P>
Nuclear power is meeting some of the demand for electricity. The state now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear generating capacity. Texas was once a dominant producer of uranium, the element that provides fuel for the nuclear energy industry. However, the market for uranium has gone soft and most of Texas' uranium mining sites are now dormant.
<P>
Harnessing the hot Texas sun and corralling the swift Texas breeze could allow the state to get much of its energy from non-polluting, renewable sources. Solar power could also supply much of the state's electricity. Studies have shown that one sunny acre of land in West Texas could produce the energy equivalent of 800 barrels of oil per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#13">(13)</A> If Texas captured all of its wind resources, it could supply 10 percent of electricity needs of the contiguous United States.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#14">(14)</A> In Texas, the wind alone could generate 136,000 megawatts of electricity, or more than twice the state's installed generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<P>
Despite the promise of wind, solar, biomass and other renewable technologies, large amounts of capital and significant changes in government policies will be needed to develop those resources. In the meantime, the state will have to increase efficiency or meet new electricity demand through conventional sources, such as coal, oil or natural gas, or through the construction of new nuclear plants. 
<P>
Much of the demand for electricity could be reduced through conservation and improved efficiency of engines, motors, refrigerators, air conditioners, lights and other products. However, large electricity producers are not spending much money on efficiency improvements. The state's largest utilities are spending just $40 million per year on programs to increase electrical efficiency.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#16">(16)</A> For comparison, Texans spent $14 billion on electricity purchases in 1991. In other words, Texas utilities spent just .003 percent of their total income on energy efficiency programs. 
<P>
Some estimates show that conservation alone could reduce demand for electricity in the state by one-third. By one estimate, if Texas utilities adopted an aggressive conservation policy, consumers could be saving up to $2.5 billion annually by the year 2010. While consumers would save money on their power bills, utilities could avoid spending some $8.4 billion for new power plants and infrastructure.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#20">(20)</A>
<P>
Energy efficiency and renewable energy resources will play critical roles in Texas' energy mix as the state heads into the 21st century. The state must soon address the need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in order to meet the goals of the Global Climate Change Treaty. Signed by the U.S. and a host of other nations, the treaty requires signatories to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels. As the country's largest energy consuming state, Texas leads the nation in production of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming. The global warming issue and the 1990 Clean Air Act, which requires businesses in the state to reduce their sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions (see Air Section), could force Texas to change its energy consumption patterns.
<P>
Over the next few decades, Texas will also see increased energy trade with Mexico. Even before the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Texas was sending huge amounts of energy to its southern neighbor. In northern Mexico, where rapid industrialization has led to increasing demand for natural gas and electricity, natural gas (mainly from Texas fields) is fueling growth. In 1988, Mexico bought 2.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas from the U.S. By 1991, that figure jumped to 91 Bcf. By the year 2000, it has been predicted that Mexico will buy 300 Bcf of American gas per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#21">(21)</A> 
<P>
Texas may also start selling electricity to its neighbor. Since 1972, electric power consumption in Mexico has more than tripled and over the next decade, demand for electricity is expected to double.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#22">(22)</A>

<A NAME="OIL"><H4>OIL </H4></A>
<P>
Texas has been producing oil for more than 110 years. Ever since the first wells in Brown County began producing oil for medicinal purposes and lubrication, oil has been a precious commodity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#23">(23)</A> 
<P>
More than a quarter of all the known oil deposits in the U.S. are in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#24">(24)</A> Yet, less than a third of the 190 billion barrels of oil beneath Texas have been produced. Some 129 billion barrels of oil remain, but much of that oils lies deep beneath the surface, making production difficult and expensive.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<P>
Texas has the largest share of crude oil reserves in the nation. And the state's oil has provided a reliable source of tax revenue. Since 1930, Texas has collected more than $17 trillion in oil taxes.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#26">(26)</A> The state's oil reserves have also spawned a vast refining and petrochemical industry; two-thirds of America's petrochemical production occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Twenty-three percent of all the oil produced in the U.S. comes from Texas fields.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#28">(28)</A> Much of the oil produced in Texas comes from older wells with declining production. These so-called "stripper" wells produce 10 barrels of oil or less per day. But they are critically important to the state's economy because they are so numerous. In 1992, 70 percent of the 192,292 oil wells in Texas were stripper wells.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#29">(29)</A> Because stripper wells produce little oil and cost more to operate than other wells, producers and regulators have argued that tax incentives are needed to keep these wells in operation. The average daily production per Texas oil well is fewer than nine barrels. By contrast, the average oil well in Saudi Arabia produces about 6,000 barrels per day.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#30">(30)</A> 
<P>
Oil production in the state peaked in 1972 at 3.4 million barrels per day. Twenty years later, production had fallen by more than half, to 1.68 million barrels per day. This drop in production has forced the country to rely more on imported oil. 
<P>
Ever since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shocked the world in the late 1970s by raising prices, Americans have worried about the consequences of relying on imported oil. However, this concern has faded as oil prices have fallen. At present, half of all the oil consumed in the U.S. is imported.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#31">(31)</A> By the year 2010, the U.S. could be importing 70 percent of its oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#32">(32)</A> This increasing reliance on imported oil could have dire consequences for America. As demonstrated by the Persian Gulf War, protecting foreign oil supplies in the Mideast and elsewhere is a costly undertaking and success is not guaranteed. Texas oil producers have long argued that stimulating the domestic oil business would have lasting benefits for the domestic economy. They advocate tax incentives to encourage oil producers to drill new wells and bring marginal wells back into production. 
<P>
Texas oil producers face increased costs of environmental compliance. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that the oil industry will be spending $20 billion per year on environmental compliance by the year 2000, an increase of 250 percent over 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#33">(33)</A> Environmental costs and declining domestic oil reserves have forced American oil producers and multi-national oil companies to go overseas to develop new sources of petroleum. In 1985, the major oil companies spent 37 percent of their exploration dollars outside of the U.S. By 1991, that figure had nearly doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#34">(34)</A> 
<P>
Beyond use of oil as fuel, oil exploration and production itself can have serious potential environmental consequences. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas must deal with thousands of abandoned oil wells. Unplugged and abandoned oil wells can cause serious groundwater contamination problems, particularly in areas with naturally occurring saline groundwater. Unplugged or improperly plugged wells are vertical pipelines that can allow deep brine water reservoirs to contaminate shallow fresh water aquifers. And in many areas around the state, rural residents have been forced to abandon their water wells due to salt water contamination caused by abandoned oil wells or unlined saltwater disposal pits.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#35">(35)</A> By plugging wells as required by Railroad Commission of Texas regulations, oil producers can prevent the migration of saline water from deep aquifers into shallow fresh water aquifers. 
<P>
Some surface water supplies are also threatened by unplugged wells. Two studies by the Lower Colorado River Authority found that saltwater from unplugged oil wells along the river are causing an increase in salinity levels.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#36">(36)</A> About 1.5 million oil wells have been drilled in Texas, yet less than a third of them have been plugged.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#37">(37)</A> 
<P>
In addition, hundreds of production sites, littered with abandoned tanks, spilled oil, drilling pads and oilfield equipment await remediation and cleanup. (See Water Section). Using money from a surcharge on new drilling permits, the agency has plugged several thousand abandoned wells and cleaned up a number of abandoned production sites.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#38">(38)</A> However, this effort is just beginning and it could take many decades to clear up problems caused by past negligence or lack of enforcement.

<A NAME="GAS">NATURAL GAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Natural gas was once considered a useless waste product of the oil production process. Oil producers burned off this gas or vented it into the atmosphere in order to dispose of it. Today, some energy analysts are calling natural gas the "prince of the hydrocarbons."<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#39">(39)</A> 
<P>
Texas consumes more natural gas than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#40">(40)</A> In 1993, Texas consumed 3.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), almost twice as much as California, the number two consumer.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#41">(41)</A> Texas produces about 5.5 Tcf of gas every year, which accounts for 25 percent of total U.S. domestic gas production. The state has about 36 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, or about one-quarter of total U. S. domestic gas reserves.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#42">(42)</A> This wealth of natural gas has contributed nearly $15 trillion in tax revenue to state coffers since 1930.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#43">(43)</A> 
<P>
Natural gas is becoming increasingly important as a source of revenue. From 1985 through 1990, Texas collected more tax revenue from natural gas than from oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
New uses for natural gas are causing consumption to increase. The fuel can now be used to power air conditioners and is gaining popularity in the transportation sector. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG) offer clean-burning alternatives to fleet owners, who must convert large portions of their vehicles to alternative fuels in order to comply with Clean Air Act regulations. Natural gas is also being used more by utilities for power generation. 
<P>
While new uses for gas may help the state over the long term, Texas is depleting its natural gas reserves faster than those reserves are being replaced by new discoveries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#45">(45)</A> Since 1965, the state's gas reserves have been steadily decreasing.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#46">(46)</A> 
<P>
In 1981, Texas energy producers brought 5,454 natural gas wells into service. By 1991, the number of gas wells brought on-line had fallen to 1,471.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#47">(47)</A> This decline in exploration could have negative long-term effects on Texas, which continues to need vast amounts of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial uses.

<A NAME="LIQUIFIED">LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS</A> (LPG)
</H4>
<P>
Most consumers know LPG as butane or propane. These liquids are removed from oil and gas during the refining process. A flexible fuel, LPG can be used for everything from burning weeds to powering farm tractors. Propane is second only to natural gas in terms of heat content. One-third of the nation's propane is produced in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#48">(48)</A>
<P>
New concerns about clean air will also likely stimulate consumption of LPG in Texas. Texas used 12.2 billion gallons of LPG in 1990, most of which was consumed by the petrochemical industry.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#49">(49)</A> LPG also plays an important role in rural areas, which often do not have natural gas lines. Millions of rural Texans rely on propane and butane for cooking and water heating. In the commercial sector, LPG powers forklifts and other industrial equipment. The market for LPG will likely be stimulated by its increased use as a motor vehicle fuel. 
<P>
By 2002, federal law will require about one million vehicles in Texas to be fueled by alternative fuels like propane or natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#50">(50)</A> (See Air Section for further discussion.) Propane will likely be the fuel of choice for many operators because converting vehicles to LPG costs about half as much as converting to compressed natural gas (CNG). In addition, LPG-powered vehicles can travel much farther between fueling stops than comparable CNG-powered vehicles. Thus far, nine out of ten Texas school buses that have converted to alternative fuels have switched to propane.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#51">(51)</A> In all, more than 30,000 propane-fueled vehicles are in use in Texas, with some 1,200 propane dealers providing refueling services.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#52">(52)</A> This network of refueling centers gives propane-powered vehicles another advantage over CNG. Only a handful of refueling stations in Texas supply CNG to the public. 
<P>
With its flexibility and availability, LPG will continue to be a major energy source for many years to come.

<A NAME="COAL">COAL</A>
</H4>
<P>
By the time white settlers arrived in Texas, indigenous tribes had been burning coal for many millennia. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, tribal groups near Lake Lewisville were using lignite to heat their homes and cook their food. Archaeological sites in Bastrop County contain burned lignite dating back 5,000 years. Throughout the early 1800s settlers utilized coal they found on the surface and by 1850, small scale mining had begun. 
<P>
Today, Texas leads the nation in coal consumption by a large margin. In 1993, Texas used 96 million tons of coal. By comparison, Indiana, the number two coal-consuming state, used about 60 million tons of coal.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#53">(53)</A> Nearly 95 percent of the coal consumed in Texas was used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#54">(54)</A> 
<P>
Texas mines produce two-thirds of the coal consumed in the state. Some 56 million tons of lignite are mined in Texas annually. The sixth and twelfth largest coal mines in America are located in Texas. The Martin Lake and Monticello mines, both owned by Texas Utilities Mining Co., together produce nearly 25 million tons of lignite per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
Texas has more than 24 billion tons of lignite that can be recovered through conventional strip mining methods. At current rates of production, Texas' coal supply will last about 400 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, the state contains another 35 billion tons of coal in deep reserves. All told, the state's coal deposits contain the energy equivalent of more than 100 billion barrels of oil. 
<P>
Coal consumption in Texas is rising faster than any other form of energy. By 2030, the state's coal consumption is expected to be about 180 million tons per year, twice as much as the state consumed in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#57">(57)</A> However, the state's appetite for coal has caused serious pollution problems around the state. Five of the top ten sources of air pollution in the state are coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#58">(58)</A> Studies have linked elevated selenium levels in a number of East Texas Lakes with nearby coal-fired power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#59">(59)</A> 
<P>
Burning coal also produces sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant that can cause acid rain. Acid rain poses a serious threat to East Texas lakes, which have little ability to counter acidic input.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#60">(60)</A> In addition to the air quality problems presented by coal consumption, strip mining presents a range of problems. Since 1982, more than 52,000 acres of land in the state has been strip mined for lignite.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#61">(61)</A> Adequate reclamation of strip mined property is expensive and time consuming. Often, sites are re-planted with just one type of plant material. Biologists point out that the resulting monoculture does not support a diversity of wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#62">(62)</A> In addition, the strip mined land can be subject to subsidence and erosion.

<P>
The Texas economy is changing. The service sector and light manufacturing companies are growing rapidly. The new, high-technology companies rely on computers and the microchip to speed information and products to consumers. But the emerging information economy depends on electric power. So do our air conditioners, answering machines, personal computers, microwave ovens, tape recorders and a panoply of other consumer products.
<P>
The burgeoning Texas economy and the state's rapidly growing population have caused a surge in demand for electricity. From 1970 to 1990, electricity consumption in Texas more than doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#63">(63)</A> Without a change in the pattern of consumption or major conservation efforts, the demand for electricity in Texas will require utilities to build 90 new power plants over the next 15 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#64">(64)</A> These new plants could increase the state's electrical capacity by almost 25 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
Texas produces and consumes more electricity than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#66">(66)</A> In 1991, Texans paid $14 billion for electricity while consuming 241 million megawatt hours of electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#67">(67)</A> Twenty-seven electric utilities are currently operating 312 generating stations in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#68">(68)</A> These facilities have a combined net capacity of 60,687 megawatts. Of the 27 utilities, nine are investor-owned, five are electric cooperatives, five are federal or state agencies and eight are owned by municipalities. 
<P>
Much of the new demand for electric power is coming from the residential sector, where electricity consumption is growing rapidly. In 1970, electricity accounted for 32 percent of the energy needs in the average home. By 1990, electricity supplied 54 percent of residential energy needs. By the year 2000, that figure is expected to rise to 56 percent and by the year 2030, electricity may supply 61 percent of all home energy needs.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#69">(69)</A> 
<P>
In 1992, Texas residents paid about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#70">(70)</A> The Public Utilities Commission of Texas estimates that by the year 2000, consumers will be paying 10.4 cents per kilowatt hour.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#71">(71)</A> In addition to the rising cost of electricity, Texas is facing environmental problems caused by electricity production. Texas is the country's largest consumer of coal (more than 90 million tons per year), and the power plants that burn coal pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (which can cause acid rain), nitrogen oxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year. (See Air Chapter for further discussion.)
<P>
In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. But in 1978, Congress passed the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which required utilities to phase out the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel by 1990. Designed as a response to perceived natural gas shortages, this requirement was later repealed when new gas supplies were discovered. However, by then, many Texas utility companies had begun developing coal supplies, which were viewed as a way to diversify their power-generation base. Today, about 40 percent of all the electricity consumed in Texas is derived from the burning of natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#72">(72)</A> Half of the state's electricity is derived from burning coal. The balance comes from nuclear power, hydropower and renewables. 
<P>
In 1990, electric power generation in the state produced 66 percent of the total sulfur dioxides, 37 percent of total nitrogen oxides and 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted into the air in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#73">(73)</A> As noted above, coal-fired power plants have been linked to acidification in several East Texas lakes. The same lakes have also been contaminated by selenium, a heavy metal linked to the coal-fired power plants. 
<P>
The question of global warming has also not been fully assessed. Scientists from around the world believe that carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere will cause a gradual warming of the Earth, which could have catastrophic effects on agriculture and coastal zones. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants produce millions of tons of CO2 per year. (See section on air). Some environmental groups favor new regulations that would change the way Texas' electric utilities operate. Called integrated resource planning, the program would encourage utilities to increase efficiency programs. In addition, it would require utilities to take into account the cost of the pollutants that they emit. Many other states, including Nevada, Oregon and New York have adopted similar regulations. But thus far, the Texas Legislature has not required Texas power producers to factor efficiency and pollution issues into their decision-making process. 
<P>
Advances in efficiency could help slow the demand for electricity. High efficiency appliances, lights and motors could go a long way toward reducing Texas' demand for electricity. (See efficiency section below).

Because of its clean burning characteristics, however, gas is expected to increase its share to 42 percent by 2002.

<A NAME="COGENERATION">Cogeneration </A>
</H4>
<P>
Electricity is inherently inefficient to produce. Up to two-thirds of the heat energy in a fuel source is lost while making electric power. Cogeneration is a process that generates electricity and heat at the same time. Cogeneration units are up to 50 percent more efficient than standard power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#74">(74)</A> Industrial users were among the first to embrace cogeneration because it allows large industrial plants to generate electricity while using the heat for industrial processes. In addition, cogeneration units are advocated by some energy analysts because they are cheaper to build than large power units.
<P>
Between 1980 and 1992, the amount of electricity derived from cogeneration has increased tenfold.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#75">(75)</A> Texas now gets more than 7,300 megawatts of power from cogeneration plants. At present, 80 percent of the state's cogeneration plants are operated by petrochemical and chemical producers along the Gulf Coast. 
<P>
Federal regulations require local utilities to purchase excess power from cogeneration facilities. And because of its efficiency, cogeneration is expected to increase. By 2005, some 10,000 megawatts of cogeneration capacity are predicted to be available in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#76">(76)</A>

<H4>TEXAS ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR</H4>
<IMG SRC="c.econsumpt.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Bar Chart of Electricity Consumption by Sector">
</center>
<P>
Utilities in Texas sold $14.7 billion worth of electricity to 7.7 million customers in 1992. Texas' 59,000 industrial users, only one percent of all customers, provided one-quarter of all revenues and used more than one-third of all power sold.
<P>
Total electricity consumed in 1992: 239.4 trillion kilowatt hours. One kilowatt hour equals the energy consumed by ten 100 watt light bulbs burning for one hour.

<H4>
<A NAME="NUCLEAR">Nuclear Power</A>
</H4>
<P>
In 1942, Dr. Enrico Fermi assembled enough uranium to cause a nuclear fission reaction. Nine years later, in 1951, the first electric power was produced from the atom, when an experimental reactor lit up four light bulbs in a laboratory experiment. Today, more than half of all Texans rely on nuclear power as one of their sources of electricity. But the debate continues over how successful Texas' experiment with nuclear power has been. 
<P>
Texas now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear power capacity coming from two plants: the 2,300-megawatt Comanche Peak project in Somervell County and the 2,502-megawatt South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The combined cost of constructing the two facilities was $15.6 billion.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#77">(77)</A> Part of the reason the plants were so expensive was that construction took many years longer than expected. The two units at Comanche Peak were under construction longer than any nuclear plant now operating in the U.S. Comanche Peak Unit Two got a construction permit in December of 1974, but did not begin operating until August of 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#78">(78)</A> 
<P>
Concerns about safety and construction procedures have also hampered the South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The project got underway in 1975 and began generating power in 1988. It ran ten months before a fire caused the reactor to be shut down for six weeks.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#79">(79)</A> The plant was closed for most of 1993 after Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors discovered problems with maintenance, security and management at the plant. The facility came back on-line in February of 1994, only to shut down a few days later due to a faulty water pump. The plant is now re-opened but under close scrutiny by the NRC to prevent further problems. 
<P>
In 1992, the South Texas Project and Comanche Peak generated nearly 24.5 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, which accounted for more than 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#80">(80)</A> While the two plants are the only nuclear generating stations in Texas, many state residents consume electricity from nuclear plants located in other states. For instance, El Paso residents may get power from the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona. Many East Texas residents use Louisiana's River Bend nuclear plant for electricity. In all, about 10 million Texans rely on utilities that produce nuclear power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#81">(81)</A> 
<P>
Some anti-nuclear groups continue to advocate shutting down the nuclear plants immediately. They argue the move would save money for ratepayers over the long term because nuclear plants pose safety problems that could be very expensive to resolve. For instance, an accident like the one that occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, they say the long-term storage costs of radioactive waste are too expensive. 
<P>
However, nuclear power proponents point out that when operated correctly, nuclear plants emit little or no carbon dioxide. And they say that the plants will save ratepayers money over the long term because the fuel costs for nuclear power plants are far less than fuel costs for conventional fossil fuel plants. 
<P>
Disposing of radioactive waste from nuclear plants does present a difficult long-term problem. Texas used to send its low-level radioactive waste to a facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. However, that facility has reached its capacity. Low level radioactive waste is now stored above ground at each facility. The state of Texas plans to locate a low-level nuclear waste disposal site in Hudspeth County, but many local residents oppose the project. And even if the facility is approved, it will not open until the late 1990s.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#82">(82)</A> 
<P>
Under Texas law, low-level radioactive waste is defined as waste having a half life of 35 years. By law, all nuclear waste other than used fuel rods from power plants is classified as "low-level." These waste include items such as workers' discarded gloves and paper booties, as well as radioactive cooling water pipes and valves. These waste must be kept isolated for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in areas that are arid, geologically stable, and can be secured for centuries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#83">(83)</A> Low-level storage facilities must monitor disposal sites for at least 350 years to assure that the waste returns to background levels of radioactivity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
A nuclear reactor produces about 30 tons of high-level and low-level radioactive material per year that must be stored safely.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#85">(85)</A> The most dangerous of these waste are spent fuel rods. The highly radioactive fuel rods are even more problematic than low-level waste. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed a final storage site for the fuel rods at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. However, the site is still being investigated for its suitability and even if it is approved, it will not be ready to accept the spent fuel rods until 2010 at the earliest.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#86">(86)</A> 
<P>
Decommissioning, or shutting down the power plants, presents another long-term problem for the nuclear power industry. Shutting down Texas' nuclear plants will likely cost consumers several billion dollars. The exact cost of decommissioning the plants is unknown because none of the large generators has been decommissioned yet. However, state officials estimate that disposing of low-level waste from a decommissioned plant could cost up to $250 million.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#87">(87)</A> Labor costs and other costs could make the final cost several times that figure. Indeed, the few power plants that have been shut down have cost as much to decommission as they did to construct.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#88">(88)</A> 
<P>
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered in recent years. But new regulations under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 could make it easier for utilities to build new nuclear generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#89">(89)</A> Before any new plants are built, however, the public will have to be convinced that viable waste disposal options are available for radioactive waste. In addition, citizens will have to be convinced that the plants are safe, cost competitive and that the mistakes of earlier projects will not be repeated. 
<H4>
<A NAME="URANIUM">Uranium</A>
</H4>
<P>
The nuclear power industry depends on uranium. For decades, Texas was a leading producer of this heavy, silvery-white element which can also be made into nuclear weapons. In the mid-1970s when the price of uranium was more than $40 per pound, nearly a dozen companies were operating some 35 uranium-mining sites in seven South Texas counties. Today, with the price at about $10 per pound, only a handful of companies continue to produce uranium in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#90">(90)</A> 
<P>
Uranium used to be strip mined with technology similar to that used in coal mining. These uranium strip mine operations created large areas requiring remediation. Large tailings ponds have been created to contain the radioactive materials. These ponds, located in Karnes and Live Oak Counties, may pose a long-term threat to surface water and subsurface aquifers because they are subject to leakage. Federal law requires the tailings ponds, which contain materials that will remain radioactive for more than 1,600 years, to be covered, so that rainwater does not mix with the radioactive waste. However, these pond coverings may be eroded over time by water and wind, which could allow radium to escape into the atmosphere. The ponds must be monitored for centuries to assure that they are properly containing the radioactive waste. 
<P>
Today, most uranium mining is done with injection wells, which pump fluid through the geologic formations where the mineral is found. Production wells then bring the uranium-bearing solution to the surface. Called "solution mining" or "in-situ" mining, this method causes relatively little disturbance of the surface. However, this process can contaminate groundwater, which must then be disposed of by injection into deep formations below fresh water aquifers.

<A NAME="EFFICIENCY">ENERGY EFFICIENCY</A>
</H4>
<P>
Energy efficiency means you get more work from the same amount of energy. For instance, one gallon of gasoline can take you 30 miles in one car, while another, less efficient car, will take you only half as far. Energy efficiency saves consumers money, requires no compromise in lifestyle, reduces air pollution and contributes to economic growth. 
<P>
Over the past two decades, Texas' energy consumption per dollar of gross state product has declined. In 1970, the state consumed 40,000 Btu's per dollar of gross state product. It fell to 27,000 Btu's per dollar in 1990. By the year 2020, forecasters project it will fall to 15,000 Btu's per dollar of GSP.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#91">(91)</A> 
<P>
Federal regulations forced automobile manufacturers to increase the efficiency of the vehicles they produce. The result: between 1978 and 1990, the average vehicle increased fuel economy from 18 mpg to 27.5 mpg. Despite these increases in performance, the amount of energy used in Texas' transportation sector nearly doubled between 1970 and 1991 because there are more cars on the road and Texans are driving more miles per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#92">(92)</A> 
<P>
From 1982 to 1992, the 12 largest utilities in Texas spent about $408 million per year on energy efficiency programs. During the same time period, they spent nearly $1 billion a year on nuclear power alone.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#93">(93)</A> One of the most serious efforts at conservation in the state has been undertaken by the City of Austin, which has spent about $60 million on projects like home insulation, providing rebates to customers who install energy retrofits and attend educational workshops. The effort is now saving the city 190 megawatts of generating capacity per year, or about one-tenth of the city's installed electrical capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#94">(94)</A> If other utilities in the state began implementing aggressive programs like the one used by the Austin utility, Texas ratepayers would save billions of dollars per year while reducing pollution. 
<P>
Studies have shown that the state could avoid building any new electric generating plants over the next 15 years if Texas embraced conservation and a comprehensive set of energy efficiency technologies.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#97">(97)</A> 
<P>
Cooling units offer the greatest potential gains in efficiency. One third of all the electricity used by Texas residential customers is used for air conditioning. That is almost three times the national average.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#98">(98)</A> Also, a study by the University of Texas Center for Energy Studies found that replacing old refrigerators with high efficiency models offers the greatest single savings in electrical consumption. The reason is simple: refrigerators run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
<P>
Increasing the efficiency of air conditioners, heaters, motors and lighting units will also save vast amounts of energy. One study found that cooling, heating and lighting in buildings accounts for 73 percent of peak electric demand in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#99">(99)</A> The same study discerned that almost half of the electricity consumed in Texas buildings could be saved if efficiency measures were employed.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#100">(100)</A>

<B>1. Make sure your air conditioner is efficient.</B>It should have an SEER* rating of at least 11. If your unit is 10 or more years old, chances are it is inefficient (compared to today's high-efficiency models) and is costing you much more than it should.
<p>
<B>2. Get a properly sized unit. </B>If you replace your old air conditioner, buy one that is the correct size. If it is too small or too large for your house, you will have trouble staying comfortable, and it will cost more to operate.
<p>
<B>3. Insulate walls and attic. </B>Utilities recommend that insulation with an R-30** value be used in your attic. If you are building a home, walls should have insulation rated at R-15. In an existing home, wall insulation should be brought up at least to R-11 if feasible. If your house is on piers, floor insulation should be R-19. Good insulation can pay for itself in just a few years.
<p>
<B>4. Close up those air leaks. </B>You can save 10 to 30 percent on air conditioning costs with a well-sealed house. Weatherstrip or caulk around doors, windows, outlets, switch plates and plumbing outlets.
<p>
<B>5. Raise your thermostat setting. </B>By raising your thermostat setting just one degree, you can save as much as 14 percent on your cooling costs. A setting of 78 degrees is recommended.
<p>
<B>A reminder: </B>A dirty filter can cause your air conditioner to work harder and can lead to equipment breakdowns. Utilities suggest changing or cleaning your filters at least once a month. During the hottest part of summer, every two weeks is a good idea.

<tr><th>SAVING WATER
</th></tr><tr><td>
Saving water saves electricity. Water utilities spend millions of dollars per year on electricity which is used to treat and deliver water. A study by Southern California Edison found that fully 10 percent of the electricity it generates is used to treat, heat and pump water to homes and businesses.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#95">(95)</A> 
<p>
Utilities around the country have found that when customers save water, it reduces the amount of water a utility must pump, which in turn, saves electricity. To maximize these savings, many utilities are distributing faucet aerators, efficient shower heads, low-flow toilets and other water saving devices to customers at no charge. 
<p>
Some cities pay residents to replace old fixtures. New York City pays rebates up to $240 for each toilet replaced with a new 1.6 gallon model. San Antonio, Austin and El Paso offer rebates to residential customers who install low-flow toilets. Utility officials in Austin estimate that 2 percent of the electricity generated by the city is used solely for pumping and treating water. 
<p>
Efficient irrigation systems also offer substantial energy savings. In Oregon, rural utilities are offering low-interest loans to farmers who replace their old irrigation equipment with high-efficiency pumps and more efficient irrigation systems. Farmers in the region are now saving 20 to 25 percent on their water and electricity bills.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#96">(96)</A> 
<p>
Many Texas cities and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission are promoting drought-tolerant landscaping, called xeriscaping, to help conserve water. Use of this landscaping technique will help conserve electricity as well.

<A NAME="RENEWABLE">RENEWABLE ENERGY</A>
</H4>
<P>
With its fertile soil, sunny weather and strong winds, Texas holds great promise for renewable energy. Wind energy, solar power, biomass and hydropower could play large roles in the state's energy mix. However, at present, the state derives only about 0.4 percent of its total energy demand from renewable sources.
<H4>
<A NAME="WIND">Wind</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas residents have been harnessing the stiff Texas breeze for decades. Before electrification, rural residents relied on windchargers for electricity. Similar to windmills, these units turned wind energy into electric energy, which was used to charge batteries that powered electric lights and other devices. Rural residents also relied on windmills to pump water. Today, many windmills have been replaced by electric water pumps, but some 80,000 windmills continue to pump water for rural agricultural users in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#101">(101)</A>
<P>
Wind could provide Texas with vast amounts of electricity. Studies have shown that up to 136,000 megawatts of electricity - more than twice the state's total generating capacity - could be generated in Texas if all the state's wind resources could be captured.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#102">(102)</A> Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, wind-energy plants do not create carbon dioxide or other air pollutants. 
<P>
Wind farms in California have proven wind can be a reliable energy source. California now gets 1,600 megawatts of power from 17,000 wind turbines and the state is developing 1,500 megawatts of new wind power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#103">(103)</A> Although California leads the world in wind-energy production, Texas has almost 20 times more wind-energy potential than California. <A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#104">(104)</A> 
<P>
Several utilities have taken note of Texas' wind-energy potential and numerous projects are underway in West Texas. Some 250 megawatts of wind-generated electricity will come on-line in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#105">(105)</A> While wind-energy shows great potential, several hurdles must be cleared before it will become a major energy source in the state. First, all of the planned wind units will be in the rural areas of West Texas, far from the urban and industrial areas where electric demand is highest. To capture all of these wind resources, new transmission lines will have to be built. No reliable estimates are available regarding the cost of building these new power lines. 
<P>
Second, wind farms can threaten wildlife. For reasons still not clear to biologists, the wind turbines have killed many birds of prey. But wind energy promoters say the bird mortality problem can be solved. 
<P>
The new class of wind turbines can generate power for as little as five cents per kilowatt hour, slightly more than the cost of coal-fired power plants. But when external costs, like air pollution are figured in, wind may be a cheaper power source than either fossil-fuel or nuclear plants.

<H4>
<A NAME="SOLAR">Solar</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' solar energy potential far exceeds its wind energy potential. If the 262,000 square miles of Texas were covered with solar cells, the state would generate 550 quadrillion Btu's of electrical energy every year. That is equal to one and a half times the total energy used in the world.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#106">(106)</A> Obviously, the state won't ever be paved with solar cells, but Texas could easily incorporate solar power into the fuel mix. 
<P>
Texans already rely on photovoltaic cells to power highway lights, railroad switches, weather stations, outdoor lighting, gate openers and many other devices. Cheaper to install in remote areas than conventional power lines, photovoltaics are gaining popularity as evidenced by their increasingly common application in rural parts of the Third World. 
<P>
Some Texas utilities are looking at increased use of the solar cells as a low-cost, non-polluting source of power generation. For example, the city of Austin electric utility operates two photovoltaic stations that generate 450 kilowatts of electric power - enough to supply 50 to 100 homes. The Austin utility is the largest solar power producer in the state. 
<P>
As the price of producing photovoltaics continues to decline, solar cells could become a more common source of power. For example, utility companies in California have begun installing photovoltaic systems on residential rooftops. 
<P>
Solar water heaters could decrease demand for natural gas and electricity. In use for decades, solar water heaters are relatively inexpensive and can heat water for household use or provide space heating during winter months. To cut electricity usage, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District has financed the installation of solar water heaters on its customers' rooftops. Some 1,800 residents in the California town have now installed the units, which are providing hot water at a cost far lower than electrical heating units.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#107">(107)</A> 
<P>
Thermal solar power generators also offer great promise. Already installed in California, these systems use reflective mirrors to concentrate sunlight, which then heats oil or water to generate steam. That steam then drives a turbine which generates electricity. This technology is now being tested in West Texas.

<H4>
<A NAME="HYDRO">Hydro</A>
</H4>
<P>
The stored energy of water has been used by humans for centuries. Streams and rivers were dammed or re-routed to provide power for milling grain or cutting lumber. Today, dams are an important part of the Texas economy, providing water for irrigation and recreation as well as electricity for industrial and residential use. 
<P>
Dams in Texas provide 529 megawatts of electric generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#108">(108)</A> While that is only a fraction of the state's total electric needs, these hydropower facilities are non-polluting and provide reliable power. However, expanding the state's hydropower base may be difficult, as dams can adversely affect aquatic habitat and free-flowing streams. 
<H4>
<A NAME="BIOMASS">Biomass</A>
</H4>
<P>
Three communities in Texas - Center, Cleburne and Carthage - are using municipal solid waste to generate electricity. (However, this is not a perfect technology. See <I>Municipal Solid Waste </I>Chapter.) Half of the lumber companies and three-fourths of the paper companies in Texas burn wood waste to generate power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#109">(109)</A> Texas generates huge amounts of plant and animal waste that could be utilized for thermal power generation. Every year, Texas produces some two quadrillion Btu's of energy in the form of agricultural waste, municipal waste and energy crops.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#110">(110)</A> If all that energy could be recovered, it would be enough to generate two-thirds of all the electricity used in Texas. State agencies are now examining how biomass might be used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#111">(111)</A>
<P>
As a large grain-producing state, Texas may be able to use some of its farm production to make ethanol and methanol, which can be used as a motor fuel. They can also be combined with gasoline. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel made from fermenting grains and sugars. Methanol can be produced from municipal solid waste, crop residues, natural gas or coal. However these fuels have drawbacks. Methanol is highly toxic. Ethanol contains less heat energy than gasoline. Thus, vehicles running on ethanol get about 30 percent fewer miles per gallon than similar gasoline-powered vehicles. Both methanol and ethanol emit gases that are suspected carcinogens.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#112">(112)</A> These drawbacks could limit the use of these fuels. 
<P>
Increased use of biomass as an energy source has only recently gained attention. But this resource could play a larger role in Texas' renewable energy mix.

</H4>
<P>
Americans spend approximately $30 billion a year to manage the disposal of 8 billion tons of waste.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#7">(7)</A> Approximately 196 to 200 million tons are labeled as municipal solid waste - durable and nondurable goods, containers, food scraps, yard waste and inorganic waste from homes, institutions and businesses. The remaining 7.8 billion tons are generated by manufacturing, agriculture and mining. Municipal solid waste can also include sludge from water and wastewater treatment facilities, septic tanks and construction and demolition debris.

<A NAME="DISCARDED">MUNICIPAL</A> SOLID WASTE DISCARDED IN THE UNITED STATES
</H4>
<P>
Though there have been efforts to more accurately determine the amount of municipal solid waste Americans discard, the methodology for determining it is a bit of a guessing game. The general assumption is that Americans are an ever-growing wasteful bunch - consuming and disposing of huge amounts of paraphernalia. According to authors Rathje and Murphy, "... a long view of America's municipal solid waste stream would suggest that, on a per capita basis, the nation's record is hardly one of unrestrained excess. Indeed, the word that best describes the situation with respect to overall volume may be: stability." <A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#8">(8)</A>

<H4>
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE IN <A NAME="TEXAS">TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, Texans dispose of approximately 21 million tons of municipal solid waste per year and pay more than $1 billion each year for the management of municipal solid waste.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#9">(9)</A> According to a study conducted for the Texas Water Commission (now the TNRCC), 63 percent of the MSW generated in Texas is residential and 37 percent is commercial or institutional.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#10">(10)</A> Municipal solid waste is disposed of through landfills, incineration, waste-to-energy facilities, and land application (for sludge). Recycling and composting are also used to manage municipal solid waste.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#11">(11)</A> In Texas as in most other places in the U.S., landfill disposal is still the predominant method of solid waste management. 
<P>
An average Texan generates about 5.6 pounds per day of municipal solid waste, compared to 4.3 pounds per person per day nationally. The municipal solid waste disposal rate for Texas is about 4.9 pounds per person per day, compared to about 3.6 pounds nationally.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#12">(12)</A> The discrepancy between the amount of solid waste generated and the amount disposed of is due to several factors, including the use of recycling and composting. According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, if the total amount of all types of waste - including construction, demolition debris and sludge - received by municipal solid waste facilities in Texas is considered, the per capita disposal rate increases to about 6.7 pounds per day.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#13">(13)</A>

<A NAME="IMPORTATION">IMPORTATION</A> AND EXPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE
</H4>
<P>
In 1992, approximately 1 percent or 176,071 tons of the total waste received by municipal solid waste facilities in Texas came from other states or Mexico. Eighty-five percent or 148,143 tons of this 1 percent was sludge from New Jersey that ended up in a landfill in Tyler, Texas; the remainder was medical waste and contaminated soil.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#14">(14)</A> These figures do not include the estimated 150,000 tons of New York municipal sludge brought to Texas by a private company and applied to company-owned land near Sierra Blanca. Very little municipal solid waste is exported from Texas.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<H4>
<A NAME="FUSS">WHAT'S</A> THE FUSS OVER THE STUFF?
</H4>
<P>
Unlike some states, Texas is not in immediate danger of running out of landfill space. Though some areas of the state lack sufficient landfill facilities, statewide landfill capacity is adequate for the next 20 years.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#16">(16)</A> This is true even as Texas begins to send much of its non-hazardous industrial waste to municipal waste landfills. On the other hand, the cost of managing waste is on the rise and the public well-being and health of the environment are dependent upon its good management. 
<P>
Municipal waste, when properly managed, does not pose an immediate threat to human health or the environment. In Texas, however, there are incidences where municipal solid waste has threatened both the public health and the environment:

<A NAME="CHOICES">WHAT</A> TO DO WITH WASTE: MUNICIPAL CHOICES
</H4>
<P>
Texas law specifies the following "hierarchy" from the most to the least preferred methods of management for municipal solid waste (excluding sludge):<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#21">(21)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Source reduction;
	<P>
	<LI>  Reuse and/or recycling;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment to destroy or reprocess waste to recover energy or other beneficial resources if the treatment does not threaten public health, safety, or the environment; or
	<P>
	<LI>  Land disposal. 
</OL>
<P>
The TNRCC oversees the development and implementation of local and regional municipal solid waste plans that incorporate this suggested "hierarchy." At the regional level, the Councils of Governments have developed the plans. A portion of the revenues generated from MSW transport and landfill disposal fees are committed to support the regional and local MSW planning process.
<P>
Each method for dealing with municipal solid waste - reduction, recycling, reprocessing and land disposal - has its unique advantages and disadvantages to the health of the environment and public. 
<P>
<A NAME="REDUCTION"><B>Source Reduction</A> Management Option</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult municipal solid waste management concept is source reduction. In other words, prevent the creation of waste.
<P>
The Legislature called for a 40 percent reduction by January, 1994 of the amount of solid waste disposed of in Texas. This was probably an optimistic goal for a program begun in 1991 and dependent primarily upon voluntary compliance. Maintaining the level of current source reduction initiatives, the TNRCC estimates Texas may be able to realize a 20 percent reduction in the total tons of municipal solid waste disposed of yearly in MSW landfills by the year 2000 and reach the 40 percent reduction goal by 2010.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#22">(22)</A> With current programs, the TNRCC estimates a 30 percent reduction in the yearly "per capita" disposal rate can be achieved by the year 2000 and a 40 percent reduction in "per capita" disposal rate can be achieved by the year 2005.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#23">(23)</A>
<P>
In Texas, public education as well as citizen and business initiatives, rather than regulation or financial incentives and disincentives, are the primary tools for reducing the amount of municipal solid waste. 
<P>
Strategies include:<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#24">(24)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Encouraging manufacturers to use less materials in packaging;
	<P>
	<LI>  Encouraging businesses to incorporate electronic communication systems, such as E- Mail;
	<P>
	<LI>  Encouraging consumers to purchase concentrated bulk foods and products;
	<P>
	<LI>  Encouraging consumers to avoid the use of disposable items;
	<P>
	<LI>  Encouraging consumers to buy products with less packaging and to buy more durable goods;
	<P>
	<LI>  Encouraging individuals and businesses to use ground cover that does not require mowing. 
</UL>
<P>
In other parts of the country, laws have been passed to promote source reduction using financial incentives and various restrictions on product packaging. For example, the State of Maine bans the sale of single-serving juice boxes.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#25">(25)</A> Some cities charge residents for each bag of waste to be hauled away. 
<P>
Source reduction efforts also take place at the local level. For example, to complement its curbside recycling program, the city of Austin established a Pay-as-You-Throw pilot project - a system of garbage rates based on how much a customer sends to a landfill. The result was a 23 percent reduction in waste picked up. Austin plans to implement the Pay-as-You-Throw program citywide.

<A NAME="RECYCLING">*</A><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%"><TR><TH>
DEFINITION OF RECYCLING
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act defines recycling as a "process through which materials that have served their intended use or are scrappped, discarded, used, surplus, or obsolete are collected, separated, or processed and returned to use in the form of raw materials in the production of new products."<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#26">(26)</A>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>


<P><P><P>
<A NAME="REUSE"><B>Reuse/</A>Recycling Management Option</B>
<P>
Human beings have always engaged in recycling activities. There have also always been entrepreneurs who have made a living - some a very lucrative living - recycling rags and newsprint, scrap metal and secondary material (refrigerators, cars, stoves). 
<P>
In the United States the recycling "movement" began in the late 1960s. Believing that Americans were consuming too much of the world's resources - trees, minerals, fuel, water - environmental groups began to stress recycling. But in the 60s and 70s the market for recyclables was not substantial and recycling efforts dwindled. Authors Rathje and Murphy credit Lady Bird Johnson and her beautification campaign for reviving recycling initiatives. They point out that Mrs. Johnson's beautification campaign was in fact a campaign against litter, "garbage that is out of place." When Americans began to address the problem of litter by enacting bottle bills with deposit fees and restrictions on pull-off tabs, beverage distributors began to collect bottles and cans and sell them to scrap markets or reuse them.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#27">(27)</A> From this flurry over litter, various recycling programs began to emerge all over the country.
<P>
Prompted by the increasing cost and closure of landfills, the Texas Legislature in 1991 established a commitment to a statewide residential and workplace recycling strategy. The Texas recycling program is dependent primarily upon voluntary participation, rather than mandated participation by communities and workplaces. Governmental entities at the state, county and city levels, however, are mandated to establish a collection program for recyclable materials generated by the entity's operations. Educational systems are included. The state provides resources in the form of technical and financial assistance to businesses, public school systems and other public institutions. Potentially recyclable products captured from municipal waste include plastic, paper, glass, steel, aluminum, yard waste, used motor oil and corrugated containers. 
<P>
The national recycling rate is 19 percent.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#28">(28)</A> In 1994, TNRCC estimated that Texas' recycling rate (including composting) for MSW was about 14 percent of the typical MSW generated.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#29">(29)</A> 
<P>
According to recycling experts, a successful statewide recycling program requires a balance among three components: recovery of recyclables, processing infrastructure and market demand for recycled materials.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#30">(30)</A> Each type of waste material has a different recycling potential. For example, the General Land Office's 1992 recycling study states there is a potential growth in glass recycling. This growth, however, is hampered by the lack of a comprehensive glass collection system, the low value of waste and broken glass and the high collection and transportion costs.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#31">(31)</A> The growth rate for recycled paper, metal, plastic and other materials is affected by factors such as these, including the cost of virgin materials and the capacity of end-users. Recycling rates for these materials are discussed rather thoroughly in the TNRCC's <I>1995 Municipal Solid Waste Plan for Texas</I>. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>In 1994, 120 Texas cities operated curbside recycling programs for approximately two million people.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Key components of Texas' recycling programs:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  A portion of the fees assessed against municipal solid waste facilities and transporters are used by the TNRCC to implement recycling programs for residential and commercial solid waste, including research to promote development and stimulation of markets for recycled waste products, and to mitigate the economic and environmental impacts of lead-acid battery recycling on local governments.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#32">(32)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>  A portion of the two-cent-per-quart fee on the sale of automotive oil is used by the TNRCC to establish public education programs, local used oil collection facilities and oil recycling programs.
	<P>
	In 1993, TNRCC received 97 percent or approximately $7 million of the total oil sale fees and the other 3 percent was retained by the Comptroller for administrative costs.
	<P>
	<LI>  A portion of the $2.00 fee on all new passenger tires sold and $3.50 on new truck tires sold is used for a TNRCC program to clean up illegal dumps for old tires, to collect and shred tires, and to promote recycling markets. In 1993, TNRCC was appropriated approximately $19 million for the tire recycling program.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#33">(33)</A> Ninety-four percent of this amount is used to pay processors to shred tires and the remaining 6 percent is used to administer TNRCC's tire collection and tire recycling program.  
	<P>
	<LI>  The TNRCC offers assistance to all public school systems and local governments which, under Texas law, must establish recycling programs.
	<P>
	<LI>  The TNRCC's CLEAN TEXAS 2000 program offers technical assistance to local communities for establishing community composting programs for yard waste.
	<P>
	<LI>  The Texas General Land Office completed a study entitled <I>Texas Recycles, Marketing Our Neglected Resources.</I>
	<P>
	<LI>  The TNRCC's CLEAN TEXAS 2000, the Texas Agriculture Extension Service and the Texas Department of Agriculture coordinate the Texas Country Clean-up program which establishes collection sites in rural Texas for empty pesticide containers, old tires, used oil and batteries.

<P>
A 1993 statewide survey revealed that 71 percent of Texans polled who do not have curbside recycling service would be willing to pay an additional one to two dollars per month to have a curbside program. They are willing to pay for the following reasons (ranked in order of frequency of responses): 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  To conserve natural resources; 
	<P>
	<LI>  To save landfill space; 
	<P>
	<LI>  To be a good citizen; and 
	<P>
	<LI>  To save or make money.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#34">(34)</A> 
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="ENERGY"><B>Waste-to-Energy</A> Management Option for Municipal Solid Waste </B>
<P>
Waste-to-energy facilities are incinerators that burn waste to create heat or electricity for nearby consumers. These facilities were first promoted during the energy crisis of the 1970s when fuel costs were rising and there was a fear of fuel shortages.
<P>
The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act ranks waste-to-energy facilities third on the preferred hierarchy of municipal solid waste management options for Texas. The cities of Center, Carthage and Cleburne are the only cities in Texas that have municipal solid waste-to-energy incinerators. Together these incinerators convert annually approximately 28,400 tons of municipal solid waste to energy. (Eight entities in Texas use incinerators to burn municipal solid waste, including medical waste, but do not try to recover energy from these facilities.) The attractiveness of this waste management method is its ability to dispose of huge amounts of waste. Yet, currently there is no active movement by local or state government to develop more waste-to-energy facilities for municipal solid waste. There are two major reasons for this: high costs and the potential release of pollutants. 
<P>
The public health and environmental problems associated with waste-to-energy facilities are similar to those associated with incinerators that don't generate steam or electricity: air pollution and groundwater pollution. A by-product of the combustion process is ash, the finer particles of which are released through the smoke stack. Others are captured in the "bag house" as fly ash and the heavier particles are collected as bottom ash. Depending on the waste stream, toxic chemicals such as lead, cadmium, arsenic and dioxin are concentrated in the ash. Along with carbon dioxide and water, these pollutants are released into the air through the stack, potentially threatening air quality and the health of humans and the environment.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#35">(35)</A> New technology for incineration facilities that eliminate many air contaminants is becoming available, but it is costly.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#36">(36)</A> 
<P>
Besides the ash released into the air, the ash collected at the incinerator also poses problems. It has routinely been disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills, causing concern for groundwater contamination. A 1994 United States Supreme Court decision ruled that municipal waste incineration ash that has high levels of lead, cadmium, arsenic and other contaminants which would render it as hazardous waste cannot be disposed of in municipal landfills.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#37">(37)</A> According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, however, very little of the ash from active Texas incinerators has tested out to be hazardous.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#38">(38)</A>
<P>
In Texas, historically it has been difficult for waste-to-energy facilities to compete financially with landfills. In the past, the cost of a landfill has been relatively less expensive than building and operating a waste-to-energy facility. Often revenues from the sale of steam or electricity do not cover the costs of building or operating the incinerator facility. Moreover, to make the most of steam or electrical generating capacity, incinerators need to operate at full production and this often means that a local community has to buy supplementary waste capacity, often at fees below what the community residents pay.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#39">(39)</A> Another major criticism of waste-to-energy facilities is that they compete with recyclers over waste, and therefore they discourage community recycling efforts.

</H5>

<A NAME="LANDFILLS"><B>Landfills</A></B>
<P>
Landfills are an emotional issue: some people clamor for them, others earnestly object to their presence. In Texas, landfills have been the predominant method of municipal solid waste disposal. However, in the last ten years, Texans have seen a decline in the number of landfills. In 1986, 250 of Texas' 254 counties had at least one landfill; in 1995 only 130 counties will have a landfill. Stricter landfill regulations to protect the environment and human health are forcing local communities either to ante-up with new dollars for redesigning their current landfill or close it. 
<P>
Even with the large number of landfill closures, however, the TNRCC studies reveal landfill capacity in the state has not changed much since 1986. Large new landfills are replacing smaller older landfills and some older facilities have expanded their capacity. The TNRCC estimates that at the end of 1992 Texas had 20 years of landfill life remaining statewide.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#41">(41) </A> 
<P>
At the same time, however, landfill closures in various regions of the state do create potential problems, including increases in the cost of transporting waste, the need for more waste transfer stations, privatization of waste transport and disposal and illegal, potentially harmful dumping. Transfer stations are facilities where various communities bring their waste until it is transported to a permanent site. These transfer sites might pose the same problems as do landfills: potential groundwater pollution, siting problems and odor. 
<P>
Privatization of waste management is also an issue in smaller communities where the concern is that one company could have a monopoly over this sector of the economy. The 10 largest landfills in Texas provide more than one-third of the state's available landfill capacity. Of those 10 facilities, seven are privately owned.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#42">(42)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>A municipal solid waste landfill can conservatively hold approximately 650 pounds of waste per cubic yard of landfill space. If all Texas municipal solid waste generated in one year were piled up it could form a Great Wall of Trash that would be 21 feet high, 21 feet wide and stretch from Houston to El Paso. (Calculation is based on 21 million tons of municipal solid waste generated per year.)</I> 
</UL>

<P>

Landfills, both closed and active, can pose potential threats to surface and groundwater quality and to human health. Potential groundwater contaminants from municipal waste landfills include Acetone, Benzene, Tricholoroethylene, Lead, Chlorides and 1,4-Dichlorobenzene. In 1993, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission identified at least 24 municipal landfills causing groundwater pollution. 
<P>
Under the amended Subtitle D of RCRA, stricter federal pollution controls have been established for landfills. These include restrictions on the location of landfills and prescription for landfill liners, leachate (water that goes through waste) collection systems, methane gas monitoring, groundwater monitoring, closure, post-closure care and financial assurances. Texas has developed new municipal solid waste regulations that reflect these federal requirements.

In 1987 the city of Center, located in East Texas, built a waste-to-energy facility anticipating a cheap waste disposal option for its municipal waste. The city also anticipated new revenues from the sale of steam to the local Tyson food processing plant. A bonus appeared a few years later in the way of a contract for and from the incineration of medical waste collected by a local company. Center's experience illustrates some of the difficulties with waste-to-energy facilities. Because of the amount of medical waste the city had contracted to dispose, the incinerator was not always able to handle Center's own municipal waste. This forced Center to pay another city to dispose of its municipal waste. Even so, Center was able to recover more in fees from selling energy and incinerating medical waste than it was putting out in operating expenses. Then, for about three months in 1994, the incineration facility broke down and Center began to lose approximately $37,000 a month in revenue from Tyson and the medical waste company. At the same time the city was losing revenue, it had to continue paying for operating personnel, municipal waste disposal fees and equipment repair. In addition, the contract with the medical waste company went awry. Center is reviewing its management options.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#40">(40)</A>

<A NAME="ILLEGAL"><B>Illegal Dumps</A></B>
<P>
As of the summer of 1994, the majority of municipal solid waste enforcement cases handled by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission dealt with illegal municipal solid waste dump sites. These crop up for a variety of reasons. In a few cases, a community or private handler that does not have a permitted municipal solid waste landfill will gain access to an absent landowner's property and use it. In other situations, an individual who wants to make a few dollars will allow his property to be used for disposal of items like construction debris, old appliances and old tires at a cheaper cost than using the municipal landfill. There are also property owners who want inert waste as fill to build up their land.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#43">(43)</A> These dumps can contain hazardous materials like pesticides, posing threats to groundwater and public health. The TNRCC identifies approximately 500 major illegal dump sites each year. This number does not include illegal dump sites detected by local governments.

<A NAME="BIOSOLIDS"><B>Biosolids:</A> By Any Other Name, Sludge</B>
<P>
Approximately 8 million tons per year of wet municipal sludge from municipal water and wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks are generated in Texas. Sludge management is regulated by the TNRCC. Most sludge stays at wastewater treatment sites in lagoons for long periods of time. Large lagoons often have five to ten years of storage capacity. During its stay at the waste site, the sludge is often dried, then sent to landfills or applied to land. In Texas, about 650,000 dry tons of sludge end up in landfills every year. 
<P>
The following are the state's preferred methods for treating municipal sludge in order of most preferred to least preferred:<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#44">(44)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Source reduction and minimization of sludge production; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment of sludge to reduce pathogens and recover energy, produce beneficial byproducts, or reduce the quantity;
	<P>
	<LI>  Marketing and distribution of sludge and sludge products; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Applying sludge to land for beneficial use;
	<P>
	<LI>  Landfilling. 
</UL>
<P>
As some communities have learned, sludge can be a valuable resource. Because of the nature of the material, it has components that can be useful - minerals, metals and common plant nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen. Rather than dump sludge into landfills, where it takes up an enormous amount of valuable space, cities like Fort Worth, Houston and Austin have found beneficial uses for sludge. The city of Fort Worth has hired a private contractor to distribute 70 tons of dry sludge a day from its wastewater treatment facility to area farmers and ranchers.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#45">(45)</A> The landowners do not pay for the sludge but each user must meet certain land application standards set by TNRCC. While there have been objections by some property owners living adjacent to these treated lands and uncertainties do exist about the long-term effects on groundwater, the "beneficial use" of sludge as a source of nutrients for farm and ranch land can be a cost-effective management practice. 
<P>
Using a somewhat different approach, the City of Austin composts and then sells more than 50 percent of its sludge to 15 wholesale nurseries who in turn market and sell it to retail consumers as Dillo Dirt. Dillo Dirt sludge receives a high form of treatment to reduce toxic materials.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#46">(46)</A>  
<P>
According to one sludge specialist, it is impossible to accurately compare the costs of landfilling sludge to land application. What most sludge specialists agree upon is that if not significantly contaminated with heavy metals, sludge can be a valuable resource that should not be dumped in a landfill.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#47">(47)</A>
<P>
<P><P>
<A NAME="BILLING">*</A><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%"><TR><TH>BILLING WASTE MANAGEMENT
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Senate Bill 963, of the 73rd Legislature, authorized the TNRCC to use disposal fee revenue to conduct studies to help local governments and the private sector convert to accounting systems and set rates that reflect the full costs of providing waste management services and are proportionate to the amount of waste generated. The TNRCC currently has such a study under development.
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><P><P>

<A NAME="REDUCE"><B>To Reduce</A>, to Recycle, to Burn, to Dump: The Critical Issue of Costs and Benefits.</B>
<P>
The loss and degradation of our natural resources and the threat to human health should be powerful incentives to reduce and recycle our waste. In reality, however, communities faced with competing demands on their budget must justify expenditures through cost analyses. 
<P>
In Texas, most communities looking at waste management options compare the costs of recycling to landfilling or a combination of both recycling and landfilling. This comparison is difficult to make accurately. There are few standard methods for making such comparisons and cities rarely account for the total cost of programs - overhead, closure costs, costs of land, depreciation of equipment and environmental problems in making such comparisons.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#48">(48)</A> Moreover, the long-term costs of maintaining and closing a landfill are not easily predicted. Too often we have assumed that technology will solve the problem, only to discover unanticipated problems and costs. Likewise, recycling has its unpredictable costs, and local and national markets for the materials change. 
<P>
Solid waste economists claim that no matter what solid waste management system a community uses - incineration, recycling or landfilling - waste disposal is something that the public must pay for and those costs are going to rise.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#49">(49)</A>

<A NAME="RADIOACTIVE">RADIOACTIVE</A> WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Since the splitting of the atom, both uranium and plutonium have been used to create bombs, provide medical supplies and furnish energy. Not surprisingly, these uses create waste management problems: what do you do with materials which stay radioactive for tens of thousands of years? The disposal of most radioactive materials is regulated under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as well as by a radioactive material licensing program established by the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978. While some states are subject to direct control by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Texas also has its own laws and regulations relating to the use of radioactive materials and radioactive waste disposal. Radioactive waste can be divided into four categories (see box).

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>Nickel-59, a low-level radioactive waste, has a half-life of 75,000 years - in 75,000 years it will be half as radioactive as today - and will stay radioactive for upwards of 750,000 years. Humans in their present form have roamed the earth for 100,000 years.

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="95%"><TR><th>WHAT IS RADIOACTIVE WASTE?
</th></tr><tr><td>
<B>Low-Level Radioactive Waste: </B>All tools, instruments, pipes, syringes, paper, water, soils and protective clothing such as gloves contaminated with radioactive materials can be considered low-level radioactive waste. Definitions vary by state; nationwide, the standard is any radioactive waste less than 100 nanocuries per gram of transuranics. Nationwide, about 80 percent of low-level radioactive waste by volume is from nuclear power plants. Low-level "fuel-related" radioactive waste such as sludges, resins and evaporator bottoms from cleaning the large volumes of water used at nuclear power reactors, and clothes, paper and filters contaminated by radioactive waste make up one category of nuclear-generated waste. Low-level "neutron-activated waste" from the intense bombardment of reactor parts with radioactive neutrons is a second category of low-level radioactive waste. Finally, hospitals and other medical facilities also produce low-level radioactive waste.

There is a significant difference between the hazards associated with different types of low-level radioactive waste. While medical waste remains hazardous for less than an average of eight months, low-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can remain radioactive for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#16">(16)</A> About 1.4 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste were disposed of in the U.S. in 1991 - enough to fill about 280 box-cars.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#17">(17)</A> The last existing U.S. commercial low-level radioactive dump site (in South Carolina) closed in July of 1994.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
<B>High-Level Radioactive Waste:</B> Radioactive material that results from the reprocessing of nuclear fuel; from spent fuel rods removed from nuclear power reactor (a machine that splits atoms to make radioactive heat to boil water used for electricity generation); and from nuclear weapons. High-level radioactive waste is currently being stored on-site at weapon manufacturing plants and power plants around the nation until a permanent disposal site can be located.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#22">(22)</A>
<P>
<B>Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material</B>: Uranium and phosphate mining and a number of other industrial activities also generate mountains of radioactive waste referred to as "tailings," which are one example of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). Tailings are the radioactive soil and sand left on the ground after uranium ore has been crushed and processed for its radioactivity. These waste contain uranium and radium as well as a number of toxic chemicals. Increased incidence of cancer in some mine workers has been associated with their exposure to these waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#23">(23)</A>
<P>
In addition, coal power production, oil and gas exploration and production, fertilizer production and water treatment can all produce NORM waste. For example, the insides of oil extraction pipes may be coated with radium, or radium may be brought up to the surface while drilling for oil.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#24">(24)</A> NORM waste are managed apart from other radioactive and toxic waste. 
<P>
<B>Transuranic Waste or TR: </B>Waste containing plutonium and other elements heavier than uranium. It comes mainly from the nuclear weapons industry.

</H4><P>
In Texas, low-level radioactive waste associated with power plants, industries, hospitals and research connected with the University of Texas System and mining amounts to about 20,000 cubic feet per year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#10">(10)</A> By volume, about a third of this low-level radioactive waste comes from Texas' two nuclear power reactors: the South Texas Project in Matagorda County, and the two-unit Comanche Peak Project in Somervell County.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#11">(11)</A> 
<P>
By the amount of radioactivity - as measured in a radioactivity scale known as curies - nuclear power plants account for at least 70 percent of the state's low-level radioactive waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#12">(12)</A> While most waste produced in Texas stays radioactive less than 100 years, about 1 percent - again associated with power plants - will remain hazardous for thousands and even hundreds of thousands of years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#13">(13)</A>
<P>
Federal and state definitions differ. In Texas, low-level radioactive waste includes radioactive waste that has a half-life of 35 years or less and fewer than 10 nanocuries per gram of transuranics, as well as waste with half-lives of more than 35 years if special criteria for the disposal of the waste are established by the TNRCC.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#14">(14)</A> These special criteria have been met by the TNRCC for some waste. The federal definition is more lenient since it considers any radioactive waste that has less than 100 nanocuries per gram low-level.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#15">(15)</A> In 1995, the Texas Legislature considered changing Texas regulations so that state and federal definitions of low-level radioactive waste would be the same.

Texas' nuclear plants - as well as many of the universities and industries - sent their waste to a low-level radioactive facility in Barnwell, South Carolina until July of 1994, when the facility closed. Since the closing of the facility, the two nuclear plants have stored their nuclear waste on-site in above-ground facilities, while hospitals and universities have either stored it on-site or sent it to a centralized storage facility in Fort Stockton.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#19">(19)</A> 
<P>
A proposed compact between Texas, Vermont and Maine contemplates the disposal of low-level radioactive waste from these three states in a proposed underground cement bunker landfill in Hudspeth County, Texas, seven miles from the town of Sierra Blanca. In 1981, the Texas Legislature created the Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority to develop a state site to manage LLRW. In 1992, the Waste Disposal Authority approved the Hudspeth County site. The site must be permitted by the TNRCC before it can begin operation, scheduled for 1996. If permitted, it would take waste for 30 years, although under the compact the state would maintain supervision for 100 years. 
<P>
Proponents of the site include state and university officials, the utility industry and others. They argue that it would be far superior than the present policy of storing the waste on-site at locations throughout the state, with limited state supervision.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#20">(20)</A> The areas where low-level radioactive waste are presently being stored tend to be more prone to flooding and natural disasters, raising the possibility that radioactive waste could leach from the storage areas. Finally, proponents point out that the Hudspeth County site is technologically superior to any site presently operated in the country. 
<P>
Local and state environmental groups have opposed the project on several grounds. They argue that nuclear power plants should store their own waste in above-ground storage units because it would prevent traffic mishaps and make power plants themselves responsible. A centralized storage facility could take care of less-radioactive industrial and university waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#21">(21)</A> Other stated reasons for the groups' opposition include concerns related to the geologic stability of the proposed site, which lies near aquifers Texas shares with Mexico, how large it needs to be and whether, if it is the first new low-level waste site in the U.S., it will eventually have to take waste from around the country.

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>Only 1.4 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste was generated in 1990 nationwide, while experts of the nuclear waste disposal industry in the late 1970s were predicting as much as 5 million cubic feet by that date.

<P>
In addition to low-level radioactive waste, Texas' two nuclear power plants also produce spent fuel rods and other high-level nuclear waste, which is stored in pools of water at the reactors. By 1990, the nation's nuclear plants had produced more than 20,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#25">(25)</A> In addition, while taking apart the nation's nuclear arsenal, tons of plutonium will be stored at the Pantex nuclear weapons plant some 16 miles northeast of Amarillo. About 2,000 nuclear weapons will be dismantled there each year and stored at the plant site.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#26">(26)</A>
<P>
Other radioactive waste such as those generated by uranium mining, phosphate mining, oil and gas production and many other industries are not proposed to go to the LLRW site. These materials have not received the attention or regulation that other radioactive waste have. 
<P>
Uranium is used by the nuclear power industry. Texas has been a leading producer of this mineral, which can also be used to make nuclear weapons. Uranium used to be strip-mined much like coal mining. This mining process results in "tailings," left over radioactive material from the processing of uranium, as well as the need for the remediation of areas that have been mined. These tailing materials have been placed in ponds, which often have neither natural nor synthetic liners. Some ponds have leaked, contaminating soils and subsurface aquifers, as well as emitted radioactive gases into the atmosphere.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#27">(27)</A>
<P>
While no uranium strip-mines are currently operating in Texas, three companies are involved in reclamation projects at five different uranium mining sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#28">(28)</A> In addition, four tailing ponds in Karnes and Live Oak Counties are being closed and covered to prevent further contamination of subsurface aquifers or radioactive waste emissions. Three of the sites - run by Chevron, Exxon and Conoco - are being supervised by the TNRCC, while the Department of Energy is supervising clean up of a fourth tailing pond in an area which produced uranium for the defense industry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#29">(29)</A>
<P>
Recently in Texas, uranium mining has been limited to 22 sites which use injection wells rather than a uranium strip mining operation. The injection process does not result in tailings. However, only two of these sites were mining as of September 1994, with the others closing down operations as the demand for uranium decreased.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#30">(30)</A> These "in-situ" or "solution" mines are considered by state agency regulators to present less environmental problems than strip-mines because liquids are pumped underground to dislodge uranium which is then pumped out through wells. Temporary settling ponds which store water, sand and precipitate and drilling liquids must be lined, but not covered.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#31">(31)</A> However, spills, accidents and leaks can still occur at such facilities. 
<H4>
<A NAME="WHY">WHY DO</A> WE CARE ABOUT HAZARDOUS WASTE? 
</H4>
<P>
Over the last five years, Texans and their industries have produced at least 60 million tons of hazardous waste every year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#32">(32)</A> Although there are plenty of places to put our industrial waste, none of the management or disposal alternatives is fail-safe. Among state officials and the public, serious concerns about both commercial management of industrial waste and on-site industrial management of waste remain:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Hazardous and many "non-hazardous" industrial waste are inherently dangerous to human health and the environment no matter how they are managed;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Hazardous and industrial land disposal units in Texas resulted in more than 450 cases of groundwater contamination over the last five years;<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#33">(33)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  Underground, as of February 1994, the 150,000 chemical and petroleum storage tanks in Texas had reported 15,731 leaks, contaminating either groundwater, soils or both;<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#34">(34)</A> 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Abandoned oil and gas and water wells located near a hazardous waste injection well might provide possible avenues for hazardous waste injected underground to seep up to the surface or into underground drinking water supplies;<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#35">(35)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  The specific health effects of many toxic substances are not well understood, and past experience with toxics such as dioxin has shown us that some toxic chemicals can accumulate in the environment for many years before their worst effects are revealed.
	 <P>
	<LI>  The continued disposal of "non-hazardous" industrial waste at both municipal solid waste landfills and industrial solid waste facilities and at oil and gas exploration and production sites is not as highly regulated as hazardous waste disposal. In fact, municipal solid waste landfills are more highly regulated than non-hazardous industrial solid waste disposal sites, which often do not require permits, groundwater monitoring, liners or leachate collection systems despite the dangerous waste they may contain. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Thousands of abandoned industrial waste sites in Texas will require public management and clean-up well into the 21st century.

<A NAME="PRODUCES">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE IN TEXAS: WHO PRODUCES IT?
</H4>
<P>
Historically, Texas has ranked first in the nation in total hazardous waste generated, due to the state's large size and industrial base.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#36">(36)</A> Industries in Texas reported producing between 60 and 65 million tons of hazardous waste each year between 1986 and 1990. However, a new EPA rule known as the Toxicity Characteristic rule caused many waste that were previously considered non-hazardous to also be defined as hazardous. For example, the rule made large volumes of wastewater stored in surface impoundments and holding ponds subject to regulation as hazardous waste if they contained toxic levels of certain chemicals such as benzene, lead and arsenic. The new rule forced industries to discontinue the use of surface impoundments for holding and treating these large volumes of waste, and begin treating them in wastewater treatment tanks and facilities. Because of this rule, which expands the universe of waste considered dangerous, the amount of hazardous waste from 1990 to 1991 doubled.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#37">(37)</A> By 1993, preliminary data showed that Texas industries generated about 180 million tons of hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#38">(38)</A>
<P>
Thus, in 1991, while 17 million Texans discarded about 21 million tons of municipal waste in the state, some 7,000 businesses, commercial institutions and industries produced 139 million tons of "hazardous" waste. These economic sectors - along with the oil and gas exploration and development industry -  also produced another 103 million tons of Class 1, "non-hazardous" waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#39">(39)</A> Finally, solid waste generators were not required to report millions of tons of Class 2 and Class 3 industrial waste to the TNRCC, although municipal solid waste facilities were required to report any reception of these waste.
<P>
In 1992, Texas led the nation in the amount of toxic chemicals released on-site and transferred off-site. This information is from the Toxic Release Inventory Program, which requires major manufacturing companies to report to the Environmental Protection Agency their toxic releases and transfers (see box).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#40">(40)</A>
<P>
In 1991, more than 80 percent of the industrial hazardous waste generated in Texas was from facilities in Harris, Galveston, Brazoria, Nueces and Harrison counties.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#41">(41)</A> By 1993, these five counties still accounted for 80 percent of all hazardous waste generated (see <I>Counties </I>section for a full list).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#42">(42)</A> Most hazardous waste in Texas is generated by two industrial sectors: petroleum refining and chemicals and allied products. For example, in 1987, these two industrial classifications accounted for 76 percent of all waste generated. By 1991, they accounted for more than 93 percent.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#43">(43)</A> Most of the increase is due to the new wastewater rule since these industries produce large volumes of wastewater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
The top 25 producers of hazardous waste in Texas generated about 90 percent of all hazardous waste in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#45">(45)</A> It should be noted that volume - how much you produce - does not necessarily correspond to how hazardous the waste stream is to human health and the environment. Some methods of disposal and some types of hazardous waste are potentially more damaging than others.

<A NAME="SAFELY">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE: WHERE TO SAFELY PUT IT?
</H4>
<P>
Industrial solid waste can be managed either on-site - at the facility where it is generated - or off-site at commercial facilities. Whether on-site or off-site, industrial solid waste can be disposed of through the use of municipal and industrial wastewater facilities; land disposal facilities such as landfills, waste pits - principally for petroleum exploration waste - and deep underground injection wells; and incineration or waste-to-energy facilities like cement kilns. A variety of treatment, recycling and other management options also exist for many types of industrial waste. 
<P>
About 96 percent of hazardous waste and 99 percent of Class 1 waste were managed on site (at the facility where the waste is generated) in 1991. The majority of on-site management is through wastewater treatment facilities, which consist of storage and treatment tanks as well as more complex wastewater treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#46">(46)</A> Once the level of hazardous waste is decreased to a certain level by treatment, the water is then discharged, either through a publicly-owned (wastewater) treatment works or from the industrial facility itself. Besides on-site waste-water facilities, most of the other waste managed on-site was injected underground into deep wells.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#47">(47)</A>

A new hazardous waste tracking system, called HAZTRAKS, was implemented in 1993 by the Environmental Protection Agency to better track how much hazardous waste was being imported from Mexico and to also help determine if hazardous waste regulations were being violated. The computer system uses the "cradle-to-grave" hazardous waste manifests to record the waste from its initial generation and transport to its disposal. EPA officials are sent manifests from U.S. Customs about a week after the shipments cross the border, while the final manifests finally reach HAZTRAKS some six months after the border crossing. In addition, Mexico has provided information to the system from its import and export guides filed by companies with its government.
<P>
Mexico also currently has a ban on the import of hazardous waste for disposal. However, the country does allow the import of waste if it is used to recycle or recover valuable materials. For example, cement kiln facilities are allowed to import hazardous waste if they use it to help power their production process. This recycling exemption on the ban of hazardous waste is controversial. In 1991, Texas industries shipped about 25,224 tons of hazardous waste to commercial management facilities for recycling in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#57">(57)</A>

WHAT ARE "TOXICS" AND WHERE DO THEY GO?
</th></tr><tr><td>
All major manufacturing industries must report their releases and transfers of more than 300 individual toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemi-cal compounds - chemicals which have been determined to be harmful to humans and/or the environment - to both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Of these specific chemicals, 123 are defined as carcino-gens based on work-place standards, while chemicals like ozone depleters may affect the environment more directly than humans.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
Texas facilities released 381 million pounds of these toxic chemicals in 1993 to the air, water and land -- both above and below the ground -- while transferring another 91 million pounds to other authorized facilities for treatment, storage and disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#61">(61)</A> Texas is the second largest volume producer of toxic chemical releases and the largest producer of releases and transfers in the country.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#62">(62)</A> However, it should be noted that Texas is also the second largest state in terms of population, and has the largest concentration of certain types of industries such as chemicals and petroleum refining. 
<P>
From 1987 to 1993, Texas showed a 23.2 percent reduction in on-site releases and off-site transfers.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#63">(63)</A> In fact, Texas industries have reduced toxic productions faster than industries in other states. However, interpreting these numbers is difficult. Each year there are a different number of facilities reporting. The amount of toxic releases and transfers is affected by the amount of production and general economic conditions. Still, most major companies have significantly reduced toxic releases over the last five years (see section on waste minimization and source reduction).

<A NAME="EXPORTS">EXPORTS</A>, IMPORTS AND COMMERCIAL TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Only 4 percent of hazardous waste in Texas was treated off-site in 1991. That year, 4,414,400 tons of hazardous waste were treated at domestic wastewater facilities; 470,000 tons were treated at commercial facilities in Texas; 315,300 tons were sent out-of-state to commercial facilities; and another 201,300 tons went to other "captive" facilities owned by the same company.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#48">(48)</A> More than 40 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste which went to commercial treatment facilities was exported to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#49">(49)</A> Texas imported about the same amount of hazardous waste as it exported. Most of the imported hazardous waste went to commercial deep-well injection facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#50">(50)</A>
<P>
In addition to these hazardous waste, in 1991 Texas facilities sent 613,700 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous waste - out of 103 million tons generated - to commercial facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#51">(51)</A> There are just a few facilities in the state which manage only non-hazardous industrial waste commercially. For example, 398,000 tons of industrial waste were sent to either in-state or out-of-state landfills in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#52">(52)</A> Contaminated soils and solids, asbestos materials and PCB contaminated materials made up about 67 percent of the "non-hazardous" industrial waste. Most of the remainder was shipped to a commercial injection well.
<P>
Is there enough space available to take care of all of these waste? In most cases, yes. In a 1994 report on commercial capacity, the TNRCC found that there would be sufficient space to manage Texas waste in 1995, except in the following categories:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Recovery technologies - zinc recovery and carbon filter regeneration;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment and destruction technologies, such as reduction and neutralization of inorganic compounds, biological treatment and carbon adsorption, among others; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Landfills for non-hazardous industrial waste and for some treated hazardous waste.
</OL>
<P>
The report found that Texas was lacking in some technologies to recycle and destroy hazardous waste, yet (with the exception of landfilling) had enough disposal capacity for waste that can't be destroyed or recycled. It also noted that a limited number of facilities may be available nationally to manage these waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#58">(58)</A> In late 1994, a new hazardous waste landfill in Andrews County was permitted, which should provide additional capacity by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<A NAME="HIERARCHIES">INDUSTRIAL CHOICES</A>: HIERARCHIES OF INDUSTRIAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
</H4>
<P>
As in the case of municipal solid waste, Texas and the EPA have created a hierarchy or a set of priorities for how best to manage industrial solid waste, whether non-hazardous or hazardous.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#64">(64)</A> In decreasing order of preference, these priorities are:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Source Reduction;
	<P>
	<LI>  Reuse or Recycling of Waste;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment to Neutralize Hazardous Characteristics;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment to Reduce Hazardous Characteristics; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Underground Injection; and
	<P>
	<LI>  Land Disposal.
</OL>
<P>
Thus, never producing the waste is the top priority while land disposal is the least preferred alternative. Each of the methods used to dispose of waste presents challenges for the environment and human health. These challenges are reviewed in the remainder of the chapter. 
<P>
<B>Source Reduction and Waste Minimization</B>
<P>
The best means to get rid of waste is to reduce the amount generated at the source, a process known as source reduction. Waste minimization activities such as reusing and recycling seek to return the waste stream into a production process or alternative use, thus leading to both economic and environmental benefits. 
<P>
The source reduction and waste minimization approach - often called pollution prevention - has become popular in recent years. Traditional approaches to managing waste have relied on regulatory measures like RCRA, which set up management techniques to control waste at the "end-of-the-pipe." But these technologies are not fail-safe. Pollution may still occur. For example, studies showed that even the best clay-lined landfills eventually may fail and pollute groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#65">(65)</A> Newer plastic-lined landfills have experienced similar problems.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#66">(66)</A> And accidents may happen. Furthermore, using an incineration plant rather than a landfill just results in toxics being released into the air instead of the ground. Finally, public opposition to siting almost any type of hazardous waste commercial facility has significantly increased the costs and resources to build such facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>
The pollution prevention approaches emphasize reducing the environmental and financial costs associated with managing hazardous waste. Pollution prevention is based on two concepts:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  The production of waste results in both loss of energy from the production process and loss of valuable resources; and
	 <P>
	<LI>  Once the waste is produced, money, manpower, and additional materials must be spent to manage the waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#68">(68)</A>

DEFINITIONS AND APPROACHES TO WASTE REDUCTION
</th></tr><tr><td>
<B>Source Reduction</B> as applied by Texas law means reducing the amount of any hazardous or non-hazardous substance entering any waste stream or released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment and/or disposal; 
<P>
<B>Waste Minimization</B> means a practice that reduces the environmental or health hazards associated with hazardous waste, pollutants or contaminants. Examples may include reuse, recycling, neutralization and detoxification. 
<P>
<B>Source Separation </B>keeps hazardous waste from non-hazardous waste, preventing all the waste from being managed as hazardous waste. It does not necessarily reduce the total volume of waste, only its hazardous components.
<P>
<B>Recycling and Re-use</B><I> </I>is the process of removing a substance from a waste and returning it to productive use. Recycling can happen at a plant, where the waste is re-used within the production process itself. Waste can also be recovered off-site. 
<P>
A third form of recycling is to send the waste to another industry through an inter-industry exchange. The most common materials recycled in Texas are used solvents, zinc and other metals and acids.
<P>
<B>Substitution of Raw Materials </B>replaces a raw material that results in hazardous waste with one that results in less hazardous waste or none at all.
<P>
<B>Manufacturing Process Changes </B>consist of either eliminating a process that produces waste or changing the process so that a waste is no longer produced.
<P>
<B>Substitution of Products </B>means eliminating the use of a hazardous material. For example, by substituting creosote-preserved wood posts with concrete posts, no hazardous waste will leach from the posts.

<B><A NAME="REDUCTION">Hazardous</A> Waste Reduction Programs in Texas</B>
<P>
Texas has relied on voluntary programs to encourage source reduction activities. These programs include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Waste Reduction Policy Act of 1991. This act requires that facilities that generate more than 100 kilograms a month of hazardous waste or that release toxic chemicals under the Toxics Release Inventory Program develop: 1) a waste minimization and source reduction plan; 2) an executive summary of the plan which must be available for public viewing; and 3) an annual progress report. 
	 <P>
	By 1997, an estimated 10,000 companies must submit source reduction and waste minimization plans to the TNRCC.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#69">(69)</A> The largest 600 companies have already presented their plans, projecting that more than 36 millions tons of hazardous waste will not be generated by 1997 because of source reduction.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#70">(70)</A> While companies are required to submit the plans, how they choose to reduce pollution, and whether in fact they do at all, is strictly voluntary.
	<P>
	<LI>  Texas Clean Industries 2000. This voluntary program was begun in 1992. Industries which join this program commit to carry out a plan to reduce hazardous or toxic waste by 50 percent from 1987 levels by the year 2000.
	 <P>
	<LI>As of March, 1995, 132<B> </B>companies had joined the Texas Clean Industries 2000 program. Membership includes 29 of the top 50 hazardous waste generators. According to the TNRCC, these industries have pledged to reduce their 1987 levels of hazardous waste by 57 percent by the year 2000.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#71">(71)</A> This amounts to pledged reductions of 29 million tons of hazardous waste (or more than 20 percent of total hazardous waste generation). Participants have also pledged reductions in toxic releases to air, land and water by 64 percent, or 268 million pounds.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#72">(72)</A> If program participants do not successfully meet their goals, there is no penalty except for potentially being removed from the program. However, according to preliminary data, between 1992 and 1993, program participants did reduce hazardous waste generation by 11.5 million tons and toxic releases and transfers by 36 million pounds.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#73">(73)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  In 1993, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment known as <I>Proposition Two</I>, which grants property tax exemptions for pollution control equipment. The TNRCC is charged with implementing this program, which will allow companies installing pollution control equipment or making manufacturing process changes to submit an application to take this equipment off the tax rolls. One of the purposes of Proposition Two is to encourage voluntary source reduction programs through tax incentives (see box).
	 <P>
	 Through its Office of Pollution Prevention and Recycling, the TNRCC has instituted a variety of other source reduction and waste minimization programs including:
	 <P>
	<LI>  More than 100 pollution prevention workshops to assist companies and local governments in developing recycling and source reduction plans.
	 <P>
	<LI>  Site assistance visits by environmental engineers and other specialistics from the TNRCC to assist companies in addressing environmental problems. According to the TNRCC, 31 Texas facilities have received this technical assistance.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#74">(74)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  Trans/Mexico Border Program to help U.S. and Mexican companies operating in northern Mexico reduce pollution and increase recycling. In 1993 and 1994, TNRCC personnel conducted site assessments at 10 U.S.-owned factories in Mexico.

POLLUTION CONTROL TAXES IN TEXAS
</th></tr><tr><td>


In 1993, the Texas State Legislature and voters of Texas approved a constitutional amendment known as Proposition 2. This measure allows new property and equipment used for pollution control to be moved off the tax roles. With such a property-tax exemption, the state gives an incentive for companies to meet and in some cases go beyond environmental rules, regulations or statutes. 
<P>
Under rules adopted in 1994 to implement Proposition 2, companies can apply to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to have pollution control property - a facility, device, or method used to control, reduce, measure or prevent pollution -  designated as such. Once such a positive determination is made, the company would then qualify for a property-tax exemption from the local tax assessor. The property must have been installed after January 1, 1994, thus keeping on the tax rolls any pollution control equipment previously subject to property taxes. Examples of new equipment eligible for a Proposition 2 exemption include a scrubber put on an industrial smokestack to meet rules under the Federal Clean Air Act; a dechlorination system in an industry's wastewater plant; or even a change in an industry's production process to prevent the release of a toxic chemical. 
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 2 - which included both small and large businesses and some environmental groups -  say the measure will promote voluntary compliance with environmental regulations while preserving jobs as the costs of doing business are lessened. Thirty-three other states offer similar incentives to businesses, and supporters argued that without the measure, industries might prefer locating in another state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#77">(77)</A> Finally, many felt the proposal is fair since not having an exemption would put a financial burden on companies, forcing them both to add often expensive equipment because of federal and state regulations, as well as paying taxes on that equipment. 
<P>
Opponents, including some state environmental groups as well as local tax assessor associations, fear the proposal will result in a massive giveaway of property tax revenue to large corporations. Ultimately, they point out the tax breaks will be at the expense of local school districts, cities and special districts, particularly in the most industrialized areas of the state, such as Harris County, Jefferson County, Dallas/Fort Worth, Corpus 
<P>
Christi and El Paso. While environmental regu-lations can sometimes be costly, opponents of Proposition 2 argued that the law gives every business a tax break to comply with environmental laws, whether or not the business has demonstrated any economic hardship. Thus, opponents maintained that keeping the environment clean is quite simply a cost of doing business, and businesses should not be given incentives to merely comply with the law. 
<P>
In the program's first year, TNRCC approved 752 requests from companies to have their pollution control certified for a total of $1.1 billion dollars.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#78">(78)</A> Provided their local tax assessors concur with the valuation, industry in Texas will not have to pay property taxes on this equipment.

<B><A NAME="REUSE">Recycling and Reuse of Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
A variety of industrial waste can be recycled for use as products. There are three ways in which industrial waste recycling occurs: at the facility itself (on-site recycling), at commercial facilities which gather waste streams from several companies (off-site recycling), and when the waste products from one company are used as inputs in the production process of another company. In 1991, for example, some 232,700 tons of hazardous waste were recycled on-site by major industries in Texas or at commercial recycling facilities. About 13 percent of all Texas-generated hazardous waste treated at commercial facilities was recycled in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#75">(75)</A> 
<P>
Most industrial recycling of hazardous waste involves three types of processes: solvent recovery; metals recovery; and other organic chemical recovery (including waste oil recovery and non-solvent organic recovery). The state has projected there will be a deficit in commercial capacity for some types of metal recovery such as mercury and zinc in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#76">(76)</A> In fact, in 1991, there were no zinc recovery facilities in Texas, while some 57,400 tons of zinc and zinc-constituent hazardous waste were exported to Mexico for recycling.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Off-site recycling of some hazardous materials is difficult because of the dangerous nature of the chemicals themselves. Unlike some municipal waste such as aluminum which are fairly easy to recycle, some hazardous chemicals are prone to ignite and be reactive. In addition, the fear that industries have of accidents and spills during transportation or recycling operations - and the resulting liability -  can sometimes present an obstacle to the recycling of hazardous materials off-site.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#80">(80)</A>
<P>
Transportation costs to move a waste to another company for recycling purposes are another obstacle. For many products, it is far simpler to dispose of the waste on-site than to exchange it with another company or recycle it. 
<P>
There is also considerable debate about just what recycling is. Under Texas' Waste Reduction Policy Act, companies that burn their hazardous waste for energy recovery in boilers and industrial furnaces can count the waste as "recycled."
<P>
This approach has been criticized by some environmental groups who argue that using waste as fuel is really a method of disposal and pollution is often created in the burning of hazardous waste. In the Clean Texas Program, companies can meet part of their 50 percent reduction goal by burning waste to recover energy on-site; however, companies can not burn waste off-site in cement kilns or other off-site "waste-to-energy" plants to meet their reduction goals.
<P>
There are several key aspects of the Texas program for recycling of hazardous waste: 
<P>
In 1987, the Legislature created the Resource Exchange Network for Eliminating Waste (RENEW). This program aids in the recycling of waste by matching companies that have commodities, by-products, surplus materials or waste with other businesses that can use these same materials as process inputs. RENEW, run by the TNRCC, serves as an information clearinghouse, classifying waste by categories. In 1990, RENEW helped 14 companies disposing industrial solid waste negotiate a transfer to those using them for production, for a total of 416 tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#81">(81)</A> In Fiscal Year 1993, RENEW helped negotiate 23 transfers of industrial solid waste, totaling 202,291 tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#82">(82)</A> In all, 140 exchanges have been made, saving $679,000 in disposal costs.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#83">(83)</A>
<P>
In addition, the Office of Pollution Prevention and Recycling at TNRCC has assisted companies with on-site visits and workshops to push for recycling as well as source reduction. A special focus has been helping businesses develop in-house recycling programs. 
<P>
<B>Innovative Technology: Neutralizing and Destroying Hazardous Characteristics of Hazardous Waste</B>
<P>
A variety of new and emerging technologies can neutralize and, in some cases, even destroy the hazardous characteristics of industrial waste. One new encouraging technology is known as supercritical water oxidation. The process is simple, but expensive. Water is heated, pressurized and mixed with organic compounds, which dissolve. Later, oxygen gas is added to the mix and harmful substances are burned away. What's left is harmless. This gigantic pressure cooker, unfortunately, is very expensive, although a team at the University of Texas at Austin has developed a working water oxidizer.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
Other technologies currently being used in the Texas market include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  <B>Bio-remediation. </B>This process uses microorganisms bred to have an appetite for hydrocarbons to "eat" oil spills. One firm in Texas has also developed a strain of bacteria that has also demonstrated success consuming heavy metals.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#85">(85)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Carbon adsorption. </B>This is a process in which toxic substances adhere to a specially treated carbon surface.
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Dechlorination. </B>This process chemically replaces chlorine with hydrogen or hydroxide ions, leaving chlorinated substances non-toxic.
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Neutralization. </B>This process either makes an acid substance less so by adding alkaline substances, or makes a basic substance more acidic by adding acid. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Oxidation. </B>This process adds oxygen to substances such as sulfurs, phenols or cyanides, rendering them non-hazardous. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Precipitation. </B>This process separates solids from a liquid waste so that the solid portion can be managed more safely. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Vitrification. </B>This refers to any process which uses electricity to encase products in glass. For example, electric currents can be introduced into contaminated soils at such high voltages that the soil "turns" to glass.

<B><A NAME="BURNING">Reducing Hazardous Characteristics of Waste: Burning</A></B>
<P>
Incineration is preferred to landfilling and underground injection in the state's hazardous waste management hierarchy. It reduces and may, in some cases, eliminate hazardous characteristics of waste. In the case of waste-to-energy facilities, it may also provide energy for use in other production processes. However, the burning of hazardous waste in incinerators, boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFS) and in cement kilns - which burn waste to produce cement - increases the amount of toxics released to the air (see <I>Air </I>chapter). In addition, the ash produced by burning hazardous waste may still be a threat to human health and the environment because it may contain such compounds as lead, uranium and arsenic. Finally, the variety of waste streams received at commercial incineration facilities makes it harder to control the burning process, leading to problems with explosions and toxic plumes.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#86">(86)</A> For these reasons, a number of citizen-based and environmental groups in Texas have been vocally opposed to both the current operation of hazardous waste burning facilities as well as permitting additional facilities.
<P>
In the past, some facilities mixed hazardous waste or used oil with fuel to augment the heating value of fuels and reduce waste disposal costs, while at the same time avoiding regulation of waste disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#87">(87)</A> Until 1986, some utilities, industries, commercial facilities, schools, government institutions and apartment and home owners across the country used hazardous waste and used oil for energy recovery purposes.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#88">(88)</A> Today, non-industrial facilities - homes, apartments, schools - are not allowed to burn hazardous waste or used oils containing toxics. Industrial facilities using hazardous waste or used oil must comply with certain standards and register with both the EPA and the state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#89">(89)</A> 
<P>
In 1991, more than one million tons of hazardous waste were incinerated or burned for energy or thermal recovery at on-site boilers and industrial furnaces and industrial facilities in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#90">(90)</A> An additional 200,000 tons were burned at commercial facilities. There is an increasing reliance on the burning of waste; 28 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste processed and treated off-site was burned.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#91">(91)</A>
<P>
Incineration has increased in Texas in large part because of imports of hazardous waste from out-of-state facilities as well as an increase in commercial capacity at cement kilns.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#92">(92)</A> There has also been an increase in demand as a result of the federal land disposal rules, which require treatment of hazardous waste before land disposal. As land disposal has decreased, incineration and deep-well injection of waste have increased. Hazardous waste imported from out-of-state industries for incineration by Texas facilities increased from 31,000 to nearly 65,000 tons between 1989 and 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#93">(93)</A>
<P>
There are currently two commercial cement kilns that use hazardous waste fuels operating in Midlothian, in Ellis County, as well as 32 permitted hazardous waste incineration facilities throughout the state.
<P>
Despite their similarities, cement kilns currently do not have to meet the same standards as commercial waste incinerators.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#94">(94)</A> Cement kilns are currently operating under interim regulations which permit them to burn liquid hazardous waste in proximity to populations without the same safety and monitoring standards as commercial incinerators. For example, the plants in Midlothian are located upwind of population centers and near prime agricultural areas. A state task force has recommended applying the same standards to all commercial facilities, including cement kilns, which burn hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#95">(95)</A>
<P>
Incinerator and cement kiln operators are facing new environmental hurdles which will make their operations more costly. First, the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act is requiring these operators to install costly pollution control equipment to bring toxic air emissions into compliance (see <I>Air</I> chapter). 
<P>
Second, in 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that incinerator ash -  what remains after either industrial or municipal waste is burned -  must be tested to determine if it's hazardous. Incinerator ash can contain some amounts of toxic metals such as lead, arsenic and cadmium. Previously, incinerator ash resulting from the burning of waste at hazardous waste incinerators was defined as hazardous waste, while ash that resulted from municipal solid waste incinerators or cement kiln incinerators did not have to be managed as hazardous waste. Now, all ash found to be hazardous will have to be managed as hazardous waste. The ruling will prevent the current practice of disposing of incinerator ash from the cement kiln industry in quarries. Costs could increase significantly for both municipal waste burners and cement kilns using hazardous waste fuels (see <I>Municipal Waste</I> chapter for more details).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#96">(96)</A>

<B><A NAME="UNDERGROUND">Underground Injection of Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
The state's fifth-preferred method of managing hazardous waste is disposal in underground injection wells. The disposal of waste in deep geological formations is controversial. Texas officials believe injection wells, when operated correctly, are safe; however, many environmental groups are concerned about the heavy reliance on this technology, particularly the commercial facilities which must manage a wide variety of hazardous waste. Texas injects more liquid hazardous waste underground than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#97">(97)</A>
<P>
In the 1930s, oil and gas exploration and production companies began injecting saltwater by-products back into the oil-producing underground strata. The first manufacturing industry to use this same technique to inject industrial hazardous waste underground in Texas was DuPont, which began a waste injection operation in 1953. Most underground injection wells in Texas inject the waste into oil-producing formations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#98">(98)</A> 
<P>
The 1984 amendments to RCRA prohibited land disposal, including underground injection, of certain types of hazardous waste without pre-treatment. However, if an operator of the injection well can prove the waste will not migrate from the injection zone for 10,000 years, the company can inject hazardous waste into wells without pre-treatment. 
<P>
Texas regulates the injection of hazardous waste through permits. About 200 permits to operate injection wells disposing of hazardous or non-hazardous waste have been granted in Texas since 1961; 117 of these wells are currently permitted.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#99">(99)</A> Most are located in the coastal area and dispose of waste associated with the petrochemical industry; nine of these 117 are commercial facilities. 
<P>
In 1991, almost 15 million tons of hazardous waste - about 11 percent of all hazardous waste generated -  were injected underground in Texas, mostly at on-site facilities owned by companies.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#100">(100)</A> In addition, about 12,500 injection wells used for oil and gas waste are currently permitted by the Railroad Commission of Texas to inject millions of tons of saltwater and other waste underground (see <I>Water</I> <I>Quality</I> chapter for a full discussion).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#101">(101)</A>

<P>
Experts and local state officials agree that waste disposal through properly constructed and operated injection wells is safer and less likely to contaminate surface water or potable groundwater than are landfills and other forms of land treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#102">(102)</A> For example, injection of hazardous waste into aquifers that serve or could serve as groundwater supplies for communities is not allowed. However, there are several pathways by which waste injected underground could contaminate water resources:<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#103">(103)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Injection of waste above aquifers containing drinkable water;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Leakage of waste through inadequate confining beds;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Leakage of waste through confining beds due to hydraulic fracture or faults;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Displacement of saline water into a potable aquifer;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Upward migration of waste liquid from the injection zone along the outside of well casing;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Escape into potable aquifers due to well-bore failures; and 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Vertical migration and leakage to land and aquifers through abandoned oil, gas and other wells.
</UL>
<P>
Because the areas in which deep well injection of hazardous waste is practiced in Texas are precisely those areas with a long history of oil and gas production, there are many possible routes for vertical migration of hazardous waste to the surface. State and federal regulations require those seeking to inject industrial and hazardous waste to survey existing wells within their injection area. Still, the possibility exists that old oil and gas wells may not be located or were not adequately plugged, or that migration could occur outside of the injection zone.  
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>The Railroad Commission of Texas reported that in 1993, there were 367,188 oil and gas wells registered by the state, about 90,000 of which were inactive. An estimated 1.58 million wells have been drilled in Texas over the past 80 years, less than a quarter of which are estimated to have been properly plugged. Many of these wells are potential vehicles for the migration of saltwater and hazardous waste injected underground.

In Texas, the only confirmed case where injected hazardous waste contaminated underground drinking water occurred near Beaumont, Texas in 1975 before more stringent well design standards were enacted.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#106">(106)</A> Soil contamination has also resulted from an industrial injection operation when gas apparently formed within the well, causing the waste to "blow out," spreading waste into the air and over the land.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#107">(107)</A> Spills at the surface during the handling of the waste prior to injection can also contaminate soils and groundwater prior to injection and have occurred in Texas. 
<P>
More likely is contamination resulting from the injection of saltwater and other oil and gas production waste. Injectors of these kinds of waste are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas, rather than the TNRCC and EPA (see the Water Quality chapter for a more complete description of oil and gas waste). There have been dozens of recorded cases of contamination from injection of saltwater during oil and gas production in Texas. In 1993, for example, there were two cases of oil and gas saltwater waste from injection wells contaminating groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#108">(108)</A>
<P>
Acidic chemicals such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid are commonly injected in Texas. Opponents of injection wells have argued that these acidic chemicals have the potential to eat away formations and wells and migrate upward to contaminate groundwater.

MONITORING INJECTION WELLS
</th></tr><tr><td>
The TNRCC emphasizes prevention of leaks rather than after-the-fact groundwater monitoring to assure that no leaks have ocurred in hazardous waste wells. In most cases, no groundwater monitoring is required for hazardous waste injection wells. Instead, operators of industrial hazardous waste injection wells are required to perform an annual mechanical integrity test of the well casing. A space between the tubing in which the waste is injected and a second casing is filled with a pressurized anti-corrosive fluid. Since the pressure of the fluid within the well is known, any drop in pressure would indicate a leak in either the tubing or casing. 
<P>
The usefulness of monitoring wells to detect leakages is hotly debated. There have been cases where groundwater monitoring wells have detected contamination above an injection zone that was not identified by monitoring the pressure within the injection well itself.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#104">(104)</A> In addition, environmental groups are concerned that hazardous waste could migrate beyond the injection zones over the long-term, a problem that could only be detected by groundwater monitoring.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#105">(105)</A>

<B><A NAME="FILLING">Landfilling Hazardous Waste in Texas</A></B>
<P>
At the bottom of the TNRCC's hierarchy of hazardous waste management methods is land disposal, be it landfills, surface impoundment, land treatment units or waste piles. Landfills are controversial for a simple reason: past and present experience has shown that such facilities can eventually leak hazardous materials which can contaminate both the nearby soil and surface and groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#109">(109)</A> 
<P>
For example, in 1993, the Industrial and Hazardous Waste Division of the TNRCC reported that, between 1989 and 1993, 456 different hazardous waste land disposal sites had contaminated groundwater with either hazardous or other industrial contaminants.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#110">(110)</A> The vast majority of these contamination cases occurred at industrial facilities along the Gulf of Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#111">(111)</A> 
<P>
Texas does not utilize landfills for its hazardous waste as much as some states. Less than 1 percent of hazardous waste managed on-site, and only 18 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste disposed of off-site at commercial facilities was managed at landfills or other land disposal facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#112">(112)</A> There is currently only one commercial landfill receiving hazardous waste in Texas, although another has been permitted recently.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#113">(113)</A> About 80 percent of Texas-generated waste which was landfilled went to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#114">(114)</A> In addition, 398,000 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous industrial waste were landfilled in Texas and in other states in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#115">(115)</A> These non-hazardous waste included asbestos materials, contaminated soils from abandoned waste sites and PCB-contaminated materials. 
<P>
New land-disposal restrictions have prevented some types of waste from being disposed of in landfills, further decreasing the demand for this technology.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#116">(116)</A> In addition, clean-up of abandoned hazardous waste sites under the Superfund program is now emphasizing clean-up of contaminated soils on-site rather than shipping them off-site, which also has reduced the amount of waste landfilled.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#117">(117)</A> Finally, increasing land disposal costs because of RCRA regulations, as well as public opposition and lawsuits over the health impacts of toxic waste dumping, have shifted waste management strategies away from land disposal. 
<P>
Despite more stringent regulations and permitting requirements, not all disposal of industrial waste into landfills or surface impoundments is closely monitored or requires a permit (see box). For example, industrial facilities do not need a permit to dispose of Class I non-hazardous waste at the facility where it is produced. Thus, most on-site facilities that manage non-hazardous industrial waste do not meet the same strict standards as do facilities which manage hazardous waste or even municipal waste landfills.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#118">(118)</A> Yet much Class I waste, including oil and gas waste from exploration and materials containing asbestos and low levels of PCBs, is toxic and potentially dangerous to human health and the environment.
<P>
Commercial waste management facilities are more highly regulated and more of a concern to state officials than on-site landfills. While managers of on-site waste management facilities are extremely familiar with their facility's waste stream, commercial facilities receive waste from tens and sometimes hundreds of industries. Thus, the potential for comingling of different waste streams that react, explode or ignite is much higher. Treatment or disposal of this mixed waste can be much more difficult.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#119">(119)</A>

DUMPING NEAR THE BORDER: MEXICO'S RESPONSE
</th></tr><tr><td>

Controversial plans to locate hazardous and radioactive waste facilities near the border have generated opposition from a new source: Mexico. Mexico is concerned that such facilities could contaminate both the Rio Grande which divides Texas from Mexico, as well as underground aquifers that traverse both sides of the border. 
<P>
For example, a proposal to build a 600-acre hazardous waste and PCB landfill near Dryden, about 15 miles from the border, was opposed by the City of Del Rio, the U.S. National Park Service, the adjacent Mexican state of Coahuila and many others. Chemical Waste Management eventually withdrew its permit application after the executive director of the TNRCC and the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that the company had failed to demonstrate that it could adequately monitor groundwater underneath the proposed site. 
<P>
The Federal Government of Mexico sent several diplomatic notes to the U.S. State Department protesting this landfill and a second for radioactive materials proposed by Texcor near Brackettville. Mexico cited Article 2 of the La Paz Agreement - an environmental agreement signed by the U.S. and Mexico in 1983. Both governments agreed to protect a strip 62 miles wide on each side of the border from environmental degradation. The TNRCC rejected the Texcor landfill application in 1993.

<A NAME="PROPER">ENFORCING</A> PROPER MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE
</H4>
<P>
About 12,000 facilities are subject to industrial and/or hazardous waste regulations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#120">(120)</A> In 1993, 480 facilities or industries were cited for being out of compliance with some type of industrial waste regulation. Violations include operating without a permit; not storing waste safely; not monitoring groundwater; not determining if a waste is hazardous; and violating land disposal restrictions.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#121">(121)</A>
<P>
If a company does not take adequate measures to remedy the problem cited in a violation, the TNRCC can seek penalties and an order requiring the company to take specific action. Most of these orders, however, are handled through a negotiation process known as an "Agreed Order." Between 1986 and April of 1994, the TNRCC issued 360 industrial waste agreed orders, requiring companies and facilities to pay nearly $11 million in fines. Because these agreements can sometimes involve a series of remedial actions as well as penalties, it can often take a year or more to fully resolve these situations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#122">(122)</A>

</th></tr><tr><tD>
Superfund sites are dangerous not just because of what they contain but also because of where they are often located: near population centers. The RSR Lead Smelter in West Dallas operated from at least 1936 to 1984 as a secondary lead smelter operation, turning old lead batteries and other materials into lead. West Dallas residents were possibly exposed to dangerous levels of lead, as well as arsenic and cadmium.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#132">(132)</A> The legacy of hazardous waste from this facility has left irreversible health effects -  mainly due to lead poisoning -  among African Americans and Latinos living in the vicinity of the facility. 
<P>
For example, a 1985 report by the Centers for Disease Control, a federal health agency, found that children living near the RSR smelter had increased blood lead levels. A 1981 EPA study showed that lead levels in soil samples taken from people's backyards and school playgrounds near the smelter averaged nine times higher than those in soil samples taken from another area of West Dallas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#133">(133)</A> Lead can cause serious and permanent kidney and brain damage at high levels. Even in small amounts, lead can lead to learning disabilities, emotional disturbances and attention disorder among children.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#134">(134)</A> 
<P>
Lawsuits brought by both the residents and the Texas Attorney General's Office resulted in the closing of the plant in 1984 and a $3.8 million clean-up which culminated in 1986. However, following the discovery of high lead blood levels in residents, and "hot spots" that were never properly tested or monitored, a community group called the West Dallas Coalition for Environmental Justice brought a class action suit in 1991 against the EPA in federal court. As a result, the EPA listed part of a 13-square-mile area of West Dallas as a Superfund site in 1993, and a remedial investigation to determine the extent of lead contamination has begun.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#135">(135)</A>
<P>
Residents and community and environmental groups continue to point to other polluting facilities in the area as contributing to the health problems of residents. In fact, right across the street from the old facility, the RSR Corporation continues to operate a battery crushing and lead fabrication plant. Petroleum storage facilities, an asphalt plant, a fertilizer producer, steel mills and asbestos plants are all located in this same area. Although West Dallas comprises about 15 percent of the popula-tion of Dallas County, the area produces more than 40 percent of the county's toxic air pollution.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#136">(136)</A>

<A NAME="KEEP">RESTRICTED</A> AREAS: KEEP OUT
</H4>
<P>
Long before RCRA and the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act were passed to regulate the storage and disposal of hazardous waste, manufacturing industries, the national defense industry and the oil and gas exploration and production industry were producing and disposing of hazardous waste. Many of these waste disposal sites, as well as production facilities, have closed down, been abandoned or changed ownership several times, often without the new owners fully understanding what they have inherited. Not surprisingly, these abandoned and near-abandoned waste sites have contaminated groundwater and surface water and caused adverse human health effects. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) was passed by Congress in 1980 to provide funding to clean up these facilities and waste sites. Since then, Congress has twice reauthorized CERCLA, increasing funding from $1.6 billion to $12.1 billion.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#123">(123)</A> These funds are to be used to help clean up abandoned and closed hazardous waste sites which are placed by the Environmental Protection Agency on a "National Priorities List."<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#124">(124)</A>
<P>
As of May 1993, there were 1331 dump sites on the national Superfund list, as well as many thousands of sites which are of a lesser priority.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#125">(125)</A>  Industrial solvents are present at 87 percent of Superfund sites; inorganic compounds, including lead, at 87 percent; and pesticides at 50 percent of the sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#126">(126)</A> All told, 41 million people live within four miles -  and 4.6 million people live within one mile - of one of these top priority dump sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#127">(127)</A> Millions more live near other abandoned sites.
<P>
By the end of 1993, there were 30 sites in Texas on the National Priority List. In addition, the Texas Legislature amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act in 1985 to create the State Superfund Program. If a site is not eligible for the national list, it can become part of the State Superfund Program. As of March 1995, there were 42 sites on the State Superfund Registry. Finally, there are another 2,300 closed or abandoned sites which are being screened for Superfund eligibility.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#128">(128)</A> Sixty sites have already been determined as eligible for either the state or federal Superfund list, and that number may increase to 150 over the next 20 years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#129">(129)</A> Most of the abandoned waste and production facility sites in Texas are related to the production of oil and gas or the chemical industry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#130">(130)</A>
<P>
Unfortunately, the federal Superfund program has not resulted in the expected rapid restoration of abandoned dump sites. Nationwide, on average it has taken about 2.5 years for the first stages of the clean-up process to begin.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#131">(131)</A> During this phase, the Superfund program attempts to locate responsible parties - those who actually produced, transported or disposed of hazardous waste in an unsafe manner - and make them pay for remediation and restoration. This often results in long legal battles. If the responsible parties are unable or unwilling to fund clean-up, or if they can't be found, the federal government will pay.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#141">(141)</A> As of March 1994, only 224 of the 1331 sites on the National Priorities List had been cleaned up, costing an average of $30 million each, much of the cost in legal fees.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#142">(142)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, the state Superfund program has also had its share of problems. Until 1991, the state did not have a reliable mechanism in place to fund its Superfund efforts. By January 1995, restoration had begun on only two of the 42 sites on the State Superfund Registry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#143">(143)</A> However, most of these sites are in various stages of investigation, and some have qualified for emergency, short-term removals prior to long-term remediation and closure efforts. The State Superfund program is funded by fees on lead batteries and on tonnage deposited at hazardous and industrial solid waste facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#144">(144)</A> The state spent a total of $22.13 million in FY 1993 and FY 1994 to begin the clean-up process at those sites where a responsible party cannot be held accountable.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#145">(145)</A> 
<P>
An estimated $172 million in federal funds will be spent in Texas at national Superfund sites between 1992 and 1995.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#146">(146)</A> At one site - the Sikes Disposal Pits in Harris County -  nearly $80 million from the federal Superfund will be spent to manage and dispose of soils and sludges contaminated with petrochemical waste from the 1960s.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#147">(147)</A> 
<P>

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>The State Auditor, in a 1992 review of the state Superfund program, estimated that at current levels of funding it would take more than 25 years to clean up all the sites on the state and national lists and those sites expected to be added in the near future. </I>

<P>
Abandoned hazardous waste sites are an important priority because of their potential to cause serious environmental harm and risks to human health. All of the state and federal sites are subject to groundwater monitoring. The TNRCC has confirmed that 25 of the sites on the federal Superfund list and thirteen of the state-listed sites have already contaminated groundwater with such poisons as arsenic, lead, chromium and PCBs.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#148">(148)</A> Groundwater contamination has also been confirmed at an additional 38 abandoned waste sites that are not on either the state or federal Superfund list.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#149">(149)</A>

TOXICS AND BIRTH DEFECTS
</th></tr><tr><td>
Are hazardous and toxic waste responsible for an unusually high number of birth defects recorded in the late 1980s and early 1990s along the southern Texas-Mexico border? While the answers are far from conclusive, many community and environmental groups, as well as scientists, believe that certain types of birth defects are linked to exposure to pollution from industrial facilities. The controversy along the border dates back to April 1991, when three women at one hospital in Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas, gave birth to infants with anencephaly, a rare birth defect in which babies are born with either incomplete or missing brains and skulls. 
<P>
Following this unexpected event and public outcry it generated, the Texas Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control conducted a joint study to identify cases of both anencephaly and other birth defects known collectively as Neural Tube Defects (NTDs) and search for causes. A total of 68 NTDs were discovered among pregnancies conceived in Cameron County from 1986 to 1991, about twice the rate in the United States during the same time period. 
<P>
Moreover, in 1990 and 1991, the rate was nearly 27 per 10,000 births, about six times the national average.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#137">(137)</A> High rates were also found in other counties along the border.
<P>
The CDC/Department of Health report concluded that the causes of these high NTD rates could not be determined.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#138">(138)</A> However, recent evidence has pointed to toxics, notably organic solvents, as possible candidates that could be investigated further. Some studies have pointed to a link between the occurrence of NTDs and certain occupations, such as painters, in which the parents are exposed to solvents.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#139">(139)</A> Moreover, environmentalists point to the rapid industrialization in Matamoros, Mexico as a potential source of high levels of toxic emissions to water and air.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#140">(140)</A>
<P>
Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the amounts and types of waste released by the primarily U.S-owned companies operating on the Mexican border. In the United States companies are required to report this information under Superfund Right-to-Know Legislation; in Mexico, there is no such requirement.

<A NAME="GETTING">GETTING </A>WASTE FROM POINT A TO POINT B
</H4>
<P>
Millions of tons a year of hazardous waste pass along Texas highways, rivers, coastal waters and railways, potentially exposing Texas residents to accidental spills and releases. Transportation of these hazardous waste is highly regulated. Any transporter shipping hazardous or Class 1 industrial non-hazardous waste must carry what is known as a Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest. This manifest lists both the generator and waste disposal facility, and an EPA identification number.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#150">(150)</A> Only facilities which have a permit from the TNRCC and an EPA identification number are authorized to manage hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#151">(151)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, regulation of oil and hazardous waste spills is divided among a myriad of state and federal agencies. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is the state's lead agency to respond to inland oil spills, all hazardous substance spills and all other spills under the state's Hazardous Substances Spill Prevention and Control Act.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#152">(152)</A> The Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act, passed by the State Legislature in 1991, designated the Texas General Land Office the state's lead agency for response to oil spills that threaten or enter coastal waters.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#153">(153)</A> Finally, the Railroad Commission of Texas is charged with regulating spills or discharges from exploration, development, or production of oil, gas and geothermal resources.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#154">(154)</A> The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has a role in all three programs in assessing damages to natural resources. 
<P>
By law, transporters and generators must report any spills or accidents in route. In fiscal year 1993, TNRCC received 4,896 reports of spills by transporters and generators of hazardous and oil waste. Of these spills, about 99 percent were cleaned up voluntarily by the responsible parties, and 1 percent (73) required state funds for clean-up.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#155">(155)</A> About $3.4 million were spent to respond to and clean-up these accidents. Most accidents occur on highways.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#156">(156)</A>
<P>
In addition to these transportation-related spills, millions of gallons of oil and gas and other chemical products are spilled from oil and gas production facilities, barges, pipelines and platforms. The Railroad Commission receives reports of more than 5,000 oil spills annually related to oil and gas production, exploration and development.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#157">(157)</A> The General Land Office responded to 1,304 spills into coastal waters of the state in 1993. Cleaning up 45 of these sites cost $150,000. Funds generated from a fee assessed on all crude oil loaded or unloaded in Texas ports were used for those oil spill clean-ups in which a responsible party cannot be identified (see "Coastal Waters" section, <I>Water Quality </I>chapter).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#158">(158)</A>

Note: El Paso represents a special case. The graphic only shows sources from within the El Paso County area, where an estimated 88 tons of NOx and 90 tons of VOCs are released into the atmosphere -  a relatively low amount compared to Texas' other cities. However, El Paso shares the border with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which has a significant influence on air quality in Mexico. A special section later in this chapter - "Sharing Air Along the U.S. -Mexico Border" - will highlight some of these issues.
<P>
Stationary/Area Sources: Major industrial sources (petroleum storage and petrochemical facilities, major manufacturing plants, gasoline pipelines, power plants) and area minor industrial sources (gasoline stations, dry cleaners, oil and gas production, small coating and painting operations, small print shops, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, consumer commercial solvent use).
<P>
Mobile Sources: Off-road (recreational boats, agricultural, construction, industrial equipment, lawn and garden equipment, airplanes) and on-road (highway vehicles, both gasoline and diesel).

Note: 23,000,000 million pounds in Brazoria County and 5,970,000 pounds not initially reported to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission under the Toxic Release Inventory Program are included in these counties' total. These extra pounds were not included due to company misunderstanding over whether ammonia sulfate had been delisted in 1993.

<TR><TH>PUBLIC OPINION</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Many opinion polls have been taken over the years to gauge the public's attitude toward agrichemicals. One of the most recent was a nationwide phone interview survey of 800 Americans conducted by the Public Voice for Food and Health Policy in 1993. Following are some of the findings of that survey:<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#23">(23)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Americans' concerns about agrichemicals exceeded their concerns about food poisoning from bacteria in meat, growth hormones in milk, secondhand smoke and air pollution from cars and industries.
	<P>
	<LI>Sixty-eight percent of Americans are very concerned about the health effect on young children from chemicals used to grow food. An additional 24 percent are somewhat concerned. 
	<P>
	<LI>Sixty percent are very concerned about the health problems caused by chemicals and pesticides used to grow food; an additional 32 percent are somewhat concerned. 
	<P>
	<LI>Sixty-seven percent are very concerned about the effects of pesticides in the environment; an additional 26 percent are somewhat concerned.
	<P>
	<LI>Eighty-four percent think the government should be actively involved in encouraging farmers to significantly reduce their use of chemicals and pesticides.

<A NAME="RISK">RISK ASSESSMENT</A>: A TRICKY BUSINESS
</H4>
<p>
As pointed out, before any pesticide is used on a food crop, the EPA must set the residue tolerance levels. In determining the allowable minimum residue, EPA uses an approach called risk assessment. Risk assessment is the basis for most food-safety <BR>and toxic-chemical regulatory decisions made in the United States and other countries.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#26">(26)</A> 
<p>
Risk assessment is, as one author states, "the process of determining the probability of a bad outcome."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#27">(27)</A> In other words, to what quantity of a particular pesticide can humans be exposed without experiencing unacceptable harm? In assessing the potential dangers of pesticides to humans, the EPA considers cancer, not reproductive damage, neurological damage, respiratory or immune system damage. Although the EPA historically has not followed any strict risk analysis guidelines, it now considers a risk of one additional case of cancer per one million population as an insignificant, or negligible, risk.
<p>
In setting pesticide tolerance levels for food crops, the EPA has relied on risk assessment studies conducted on animals and provided by the manufacturer. In these studies experimental animals are exposed to various doses of a single pesticide. The EPA extrapolates from the resulting data the possible harm a single pesticide ingredient might pose to an average healthy adult. Sometimes these risk assessments are done for animals to determine, for example, how many pounds of pesticides in a lake will certain fish be able to tolerate. 
<p>
Critics believe that EPA's risk assessment tool for the setting of pesticide tolerance levels in food crops raises a number of important issues, including:<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>EPA does not consider that children eat more fruit in relation to their body size than adults or that they are developmentally more vulnerable to toxins and carcinogens than adults.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#29">(29)</A> 
<p>
	<LI>In setting tolerance levels, the EPA does not consider that raw fruits and vegetables may carry more than one kind of pesticide and that these combined residues might have an adverse synergistic effect. 
<p>
	<LI>The EPA does not take into consideration that people are exposed to pesticides by other routes. Therefore, there is no examination of the possible synergistic effects. 
<p>
	<LI>In conducting risk assessments, agencies do not apply uniform guidelines, therefore risk assessments for the same chemical may vary from agency to agency.
<p>
	<LI>The necessary data on the health effects of chemicals do not exist and because of cost might never exist. 
</UL>
<p>
Despite these suggested limitations, risk assessment studies are widely used and accepted in the scientific community. Many scientists in industry and the regulatory agencies believe that the generally conservative assumptions used in many risk assessments can compensate for unknowns like synergistic effects or lack of full health studies.
<p>
A recent court decision has challenged the EPA's approach, finding that pesticides in food crops should be treated as additives to food, with a zero tolerance for carcinogens. 
<H4>
<A NAME="DELANEY">THE DELANEY CLAUSE</A>: AN ALTERNATIVE TO RISK ASSESSMENT
</H4>
<p>
The alternative to traditional risk-assessment techniques in setting pesticide tolerance levels in food crops is found in federal regulations on food additives. In 1958, Congress added the so-called Delaney Clause to the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act. This amendment provides that no chemical which causes cancer can be added to processed food regardless of the level of concentration or the level of risk. In effect, Congress determined that the uncertainties surrounding any attempt to assess the risks of cancer were too great. As a way to assure protection and avoid costly government evaluation, the simple ban was imposed. The EPA, under President Clinton, has proposed to substitute this "zero-risk standard" for processed foods with the "negligible risk" standard being applied to raw foods. In other words, using the "negligible risk" standard, processed foods could have "approved" cancer-causing chemicals.
<p>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In determining health and environmental effects, the EPA considers only the active ingredients in pesticides, not the "inert" ingredients - those used to dilute or carry the active ingredient. A study by the EPA of 1,200 inert ingredients found 55 of known toxicity, 51 with a molecular structure similar to those of known toxicity, 900 of unknown toxicity and 200 generally recognized as safe.

<A NAME="USE">PESTICIDE</A> USE AND REGULATION IN TEXAS
</H4>
<p>
With 32 million acres of cropland, Texas ranks near the top of all states in the volume of pesticides applied in agriculture in 1991.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#30">(30)</A> The exact amount of pesticides used in Texas for non-agricultural purposes, including use in homes and gardens, schools and other buildings and commercial structures, has not been compiled by any government agency. 
<p>
In Texas, eight state agencies or boards operate some type of pesticide program.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#31">(31)</A> The major Texas agencies and boards with pesticide-related responsibility are:
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>The Agriculture Resources Protection Authority, created by the Texas Legislature in 1989 to coordinate policies and programs of all Texas agencies related to the control of pesticides in Texas. The Agriculture Resources Protection Authority is mandated by state law to meet quarterly; however, from October 1992 until August 1994, the Authority did not meet.
	<p>
	<LI>The Texas Department of Agriculture has primary responsibility for pesticide registration and enforcement. It is also responsible for an organic food and fiber certification program and for aspects of the Integrated Pest Management program.
	<p>
	<LI>The Structural Pest Control Board has responsibility to license applicators of pesticides used in and around homes and other buildings.
	<p>
	<LI>The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission regulates storage and disposal of pesticide waste and containers. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission also has authority for monitoring pesticides in groundwater.
	<p>
	<LI>The Texas Department of Health regulates the use of pesticides for health purposes, including for the control of mosquitoes. The Texas Department of Health regulates the use of pesticides in restaurants and conducts special studies on the potential health impacts of environmental contaminants, such as pesticides. Doctors are required to report pesticide-related illnesses to the Texas Department of Health. 
	<p>
	<LI>Texas A&amp;M University's Agricultural Experiment Station is involved with research efforts on major obstacles facing agricultural production, including the use of pesticides and alternatives to pesticides. 
	<p>
	<LI>Texas A&amp;M University's Agricultural Extension Service provides scientific information and research findings developed by the experiment <BR>station to farmers, ranchers and the public.
	<p>
	<LI>The Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board is the lead agency for agricultural non-point-source pollution, including pesticide pollution.

<A NAME="STATE">STATE</A> PESTICIDE REGULATIONS
</H4>
<p>
The Texas Department of Agriculture, like many state agencies charged with pesticide regulation, acts as a "gatekeeper" for the federal law. Though each state can impose certain stricter standards and ban federally approved pesticides or restrict their use, few states take these actions. The Texas Department of Agriculture has not banned any pesticide that has been federally registered.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#32">(32)</A> It did restrict the use of chlordane in 1989 before a federal ban was put into effect. Texas has also restricted the use of some pesticides - mainly herbicides - that are not federally restricted.

<A NAME="RECENT">RECENT</A> ADVANCES IN PESTICIDE SAFETY LEGISLATION IN TEXAS:
</H4>
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>"Right-to-Know" legislation was extended to farmworkers in the 1980s because of litigation brought on their behalf by the Texas United Farm Workers. Under the farmworker "Right-to-Know" legislation, agricultural producers are required to provide farmworkers with training and adequate health and safety information on the pesticides to which they might be exposed. The Texas Department of Agriculture enforces this law. The EPA has recently implemented a national program for farmworker protection.
	<p>
	<LI>Re-Entry Periods. In 1984, the Texas Department of Agriculture issued rules establishing waiting periods before workers could re-enter fields recently treated with pesticides. 
	<p>
	<LI>Notification Policy. Agricultural producers are required, if asked, to notify anyone who adjoins a field or resides in a building, school, hospital, or day care center within one-quarter mile of a field that is to be sprayed. Anyone who is chemically sensitive and also resides within one-quarter mile of field that is to be sprayed may also ask for notification. 
</UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="NUMBER">THE NUMBER</A> OF LICENSED AND CERTIFIED PESTICIDE APPLICATORS IN TEXAS
</H4>
<p>
In 1994, the Structural Pest Control Board licensed 3,000 commercial pesticide businesses and 7,000 professional certified applicators. The Texas Department of Agriculture licensed 6,000 commercial and noncommercial applicators and 178,000 private applicators (primarily for agriculture production).<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<H4>
<A NAME="ENFORCEMENT">STATE PESTICIDE</A> ENFORCEMENT
</H4>
<p>
Both the Texas Department of Agriculture and the Structural Pest Control Board license applicators to use the pesticides restricted by the EPA or the Texas Department of Agriculture. With money provided by the EPA, most states take the lead in enforcement of pesticide sales and use restrictions. With the goal of protecting pesticide users' economic interests, the Texas Department of Agriculture inspects manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retail stores to verify proper labeling and formulations. With the goal of protecting public health and the environment, the Texas Department of Agriculture and the Structural Pest Control Board inspect the sites where pesticides are applied. Licenses to sell or use pesticides can be canceled and monetary penalties can be assessed for violations.
<H4>
<A NAME="MONITOR">MONITORING</A> OF PESTICIDES IN THE TEXAS ENVIRONMENT
</H4>
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1987, the first study to determine if pesticides and herbicides were present in Texas groundwater was carried out in three counties by the Texas Department of Agriculture. Similar studies continued through 1990. During this period, the Texas Department of Agriculture surveyed water wells for pesticide residues in 11 counties and discovered a total of 75 cases of groundwater contamination. The pesticides found most often were arsenic, atrazine, dicamba and prometon. An additional 35 cases of groundwater contamination were listed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's Interagency Pesticide Database, which compiles the results of sporadic groundwater monitoring of pesticides. (See <I>Water Quality</I> for further discussion.) 
	<p>
	<LI>Monitoring for pesticides in lakes, rivers and bays has been carried out since the 1970s by the Texas Department of Health. Due to unacceptable levels of pesticides, the Texas Department of Health has issued either bans on the consumption, or consumption advisories, of fish and shellfish in several rivers or reservoirs. A listing of those rivers and reservoirs is found in the <I>Water Quality</I> chapter.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#34">(34)</A> 
	<p>
	<LI>In 1992-93 the United States and Mexico conducted a collaborative study of toxic chemical contamination of the 2,000 miles of Rio Grande river flowing between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as 13 tributaries which feed into the river. Among other findings, banned pesticides such as chlordane were found at one tributary near Laredo at 40 times safe levels for aquatic life. Total concentrations of DDT,  a pesticide banned in the U.S. 20 years ago, exceeded the EPA screening levels in 11 percent of the edible fish tissue.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#35">(35)</A>
	<p>
	<LI>In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a pilot study to test methodology for a future comprehensive evaluation of pollution problems in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. This investigation was prompted by mounting concern over the number of anencephalic babies (babies whose brains are not fully formed) born in the Hidalgo and Cameron Counties. The study included nine families. Pesticide residues in the urine and blood of several study participants were found, although the EPA considered the levels low.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#36">(36)</A> EPA recommended, however, that community exposure to pesticides be evaluated further.

<A NAME="FOOD">MONITORING</A> OF CHEMICALS IN FOOD
</H4>
<p>
Many different federal agencies share responsibility for monitoring chemical residues and environmental contaminants in food. The Federal Drug Administration has primary responsibility for these matters, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Marine Fisheries also have responsibility for monitoring chemical residues in food.
<p>
Since the 1970s, more than 90 reports have been issued by the General Accounting Office and other federal agencies criticizing the effectiveness of the federal system in monitoring chemical contamination in food.37 Though some of the problems with the monitoring system have been addressed, a General Accounting Office study issued in September 1994 states that many of the problems are as important today as they were 20 years ago.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#38">(38)</A> For example, the General Accounting Office points out that "Federal agencies responsible for ensuring that food is safe from harmful chemicals do not assess risk in the same way; as a result, they may arrive at different risk estimates for the same chemical. This inconsistency raises questions about the reliability of agencies' decisions on which chemicals and what levels of chemicals may be in food."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#39">(39)</A> 
<p>
Since 1991, the USDA has coordinated and funded a nationwide food testing program known as the Pesticide Data Program. Under a contract with the USDA, the Texas Department of Agriculture receives funds to conduct an annual testing program in the state.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#40">(40)</A> The two major objectives of the program are to 1) determine whether produce has pesticide residues beyond the limits allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or 2) determine whether the residues are from pesticides which are not registered for use on a particular produce.
<p>
Throughout the year, the Texas Department of Agriculture takes samples of produce from wholesale outlets and tests them in the Texas Department of Agriculture laboratories. The test results are sent to the USDA. If the test results indicate there is a problem with the produce, this information is sent to the FDA for enforcement follow up. This program was not designed, however, to take adulterated produce off the market. It was designed to "provide government agencies with a data base to react to food safety issues. The main recipient of the program's data is the Environmental Protection Agency, which uses this information to support its risk assessment process."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#41">(41)</A> 
<p>
The Federal Drug Administration also collects residue data to enforce EPA-established tolerances. In 1992, the USDA's Pesticide Data Program analyzed residues on 12 fruits and vegetables from major agricultural production regions in the United States, including Texas.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#42">(42)</A> Unlike other pesticide residue studies performed by the FDA or USDA, this was the first that tested residue on fruits and vegetables after they were peeled and washed. The results of this study showed that fresh fruits and vegetables routinely contain residues of several different pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#43">(43)</A> According to the USDA, 5,592 samples were analyzed for PDP compounds. "Residues of 49 different pesticides were detected in approximately 60 percent of all samples. Many samples contained multiple residues, with as many as eight found in one sample. In other words, neither the washing nor peeling of food guarantees the removal of pesticide residues."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<p>
Legally, of course, food may contain a number of chemical residues as long as they are within allowable tolerance levels. This study revealed that the levels of pesticide residues were substantially below tolerances, but residues in violation were found in 63 samples, 15 of which were in imported commodities. "Of the 63 violative samples, 10 exceeded the tolerance level and the other 53 had residues where no tolerance was established."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#45">(45) </A>

<A NAME="ALT">ALTERNATIVES</A> TO PESTICIDES
</H4>
<p>
Unlike air, water and waste laws which seek to reduce human exposure to chemicals by reducing chemical use, federal and state pesticide laws do not focus on use reduction. There are several state-level efforts, however, to decrease pesticide use in crop production as well as in the home, garden care and public schools. 
<p>
The reduction of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and other chemicals in agriculture is often called "alternative agriculture" or "sustainable agriculture." These terms generally refer to a variety of practices, including crop rotation, integrated pest management, reduced chemical inputs and organic farming. Many of these are centuries-old successful farming practices that were abandoned with the advent of chemical pesticides. Farmers face substantial barriers to the adoption of alternative practices, including federal farm policies and the lack of adequate research and training for farmers on alternative practices.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#46">(46)</A> Seven percent of the USDA's research budget goes to study pesticide alternatives, and 3 percent of the EPA's research budget is spent on pesticide alternatives.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#47">(47)</A> 
<p>
The Texas Department of Agriculture developed a voluntary organic farm certification program in 1988. Under this program, the department inspects and certifies producers and other businesses that process or handle organic food or fiber. To be certified, these operations must comply with the department's growing and handling standards. Producers who comply are able to use "Certified Organically Produced" labels on their products. A 1993 state law prevents a person from labeling, marketing or presenting their products as organic without Texas Department of Agriculture certification. The Texas Department of Agriculture also supports several Integrated Pest Management programs.
<p>
In 1994, 180 organic Texas growers were certified. (There are 183,000 farms in Texas.) The Texas Department of Agriculture expects to have 250 certified organic growers by 1995. In Texas, 60,000 of the 32 million acres in production are certified as organic. Of that 60,000 acres, approximately 30,000 acres are currently producing certified organic crops. 
<p>
Demand for both "green apparel" and organic food products is expected to increase the amount of acreage for organic products. Texas Department of Agriculture expects clothing manufacturers to continue to create a demand for natural fibers.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#51">(51)</A>

<A NAME="INTEGRATED">INTEGRATED</A> PEST MANAGEMENT
</H4>
<p>
Since 1972, some Texas agricultural producers have used a pest population management system known as Integrated Pest Management. The Texas A&amp;M Experiment Station and Extension Service and the Texas Department of Agriculture share responsibility for research on and implementation of Integrated Pest Management. According to the National Research Council, "Integrated Pest Management rests on a set of ecological principles that attempt to capitalize on natural pest mortality."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#52">(52)</A> Integrated Pest Management strategies are now being extended to schools, offices and home gardens.
<p>
For agricultural purposes, Texas A&amp;M scientists define the Integrated Pest Management system as the use of two or more of the following practices: growing pest-resistant crops, crop rotation, using beneficial insects, scouting fields to determine pest populations and using an economic threshold approach that indicates when a pest population has reached a density level such that the cost of crop damage exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#53">(53)</A> 
<p>
Pesticide use is a component of Integrated Pest Management, but rather than relying on routine applications whether needed or not, the system relies on targeted applications for specific pests. 
<p>
The Texas Department of Agriculture expended a total of $24 million for fiscal year 1994.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#54">(54)</A> Of this amount, $1,662,550 was spent on the Department's Integrated Pest Management and Organics Certification program. Approximately $350,000 of the $1.6 million was given to the Texas Pest Management Association, a private association, under a cooperative agreement to subsidize Integrated Pest Management work for certain farmers. In 1994, the Texas Department of Agriculture informed 540 producers about Integrated Pest Management.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#55">(55)</A>
<p>
For the 1994-95 biennium, total Agricultural Extension Service appropriation was $96.8 million. Approximately $500,000 of this $96.8 million is used by the Extension Service for Integrated Pest Management activities.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#56">(56)</A> An additional $50,000 is provided under contract to the Texas Pest Management Association to conduct Integrated Pest Management activities for the association's farmer membership.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#57">(57)</A> 
<p>
For the 1994-95 biennium, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was appropriated $97.9 million. Of these funds, $4,508,207 is budgeted for Integrated Pest Management activities.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#58">(58)</A> In Texas, Integrated Pest Management is used chiefly for cotton, corn, peanuts, sorghum, wheat, pecans, soybeans, rice, citrus and vegetables. 
<p>
One of the major concerns for Integrated Pest Management adherents is the method's inability to reduce herbicide use. In Texas, 73 percent of the pesticides used for crop production are weed-controlling herbicides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#59">(59)</A> Texas A&amp;M's Integrated Pest Management coordinator explains that the reduction of herbicides is very difficult for a variety of reasons. Because of the ubiquitous nature of weeds, they are difficult to control. In addition, Integrated Pest Management's methods for weed control tend to be labor intensive, and the costs of labor are rising. Furthermore, certain conservation practices, such as conservation tillage, actually have been shown to increase the use of herbicides for a certain period of time.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#60">(60)</A> (See section on cropland erosion for discussion of conservation tillage and herbicides.) 
<p>
The Texas Agricultural Extension Service highlights some of the following as specific benefits of the Integrated Pest Management Program:<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#61">(61)</A>
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>In excess of 19 million pounds of pesticides were applied to Texas cotton in the late 1960s, prior to Integrated Pest Management. By the mid-1970s, pesticide use had dropped to about 2.3 million pounds as a result of multiple-tactic cotton Integrated Pest Management programs. 
	<p>
	<LI>A vegetable Integrated Pest Management program in the Rio Grande Valley reduced insecticides by 66 percent on carrots processed for baby food, soups and frozen foods. Using Integrated Pest Management, a single carrot grower increased her profits by $22,000.
	<p>
	<LI>Integrated Pest Management programs for Texas pecans have increased yields by 80 pounds per acre. Profits have been increased by $306.25 per acre for irrigated pecans and $37.15 for dryland pecans.
	<p>
	<LI>Citrus producers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley using Integrated Pest Management programs reduced insecticide application by 33 percent and increased per acre net returns by $75.

<A NAME="STRUCTURAL">STRUCTURAL</A> PEST CONTROL BOARD AND INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT 
</H4>
<p>
The Structural Pest Control Board has initiated an Integrated Pest Management program to reduce the amounts of chemicals in public school structures and grounds. This program, mandated by state legislation passed in 1991, must be implemented by all Texas public school systems by September 1995. In addition, the Structural Pest Control Board is developing a program to certify applicators who wish to advertise their practices as being safer for human health and the environment. The program trains applicators in alternative practices, requires applicators to keep records and uses an inspection-based practice. Rather than routinely applying pesticides, the applicator is required by the program to inspect the property to see if there is an actual pest infestation.
<p>
In addition to these efforts to support Integrated Pest Management for agriculture and structural pest control, other state agencies and local governments are stressing the use of Integrated Pest Management as well as the advantages of choosing native and adaptable plants for home gardens and commercial settings.

<A NAME="HOME">HOME</A> PESTICIDE USE 
</H4>
<p>
For the most part, public policy has focused on the agricultural uses of pesticides and the health risks posed by residues on food, with much less concern for home and commercial exposure to pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#62">(62)</A> The improper disposal of home and garden pesticides can potentially pollute creeks and lakes, and the presence and/or misapplication of pesticides in homes and buildings can have human health and environmental effects. 
<p>
An EPA study conducted in 1988 disclosed that 80 percent to 90 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides in the air occurs indoors and that measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air inside homes. Sources of this inside exposure include pesticide-contaminated soil or dust from outside, pesticides released from stored pesticide containers and household surfaces that are treated with pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#63">(63)</A>
<p>
Texas-specific data on pesticide use in and around the home is not available. The EPA estimates that annual pesticide use for non-agricultural purposes in the U.S. is about 1.1 pounds per capita.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#64">(64)</A> EPA's 1990-1991 National Home and Garden Pesticide Use Study reveals:<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>An estimated 85 percent of all households in the United States have at least one pesticide stored in and around the home, and most families have between one and five pesticide products stored.
	<p>
	<LI>Seventy-six percent of all households self-treated their homes for insects and other pests. 
	<p>
	<LI>Among households that disposed of leftover concentrates of pesticides in the past year, 67 percent disposed of the concentrates in their regular household trash and 13 percent used special collections.

	<LI><A NAME="46">"Federal</A> support programs focus on four crops that account for 65 percent of total herbicide use - corn, cotton, soybeans and wheat. Commodity payments to those farmers enrolled in the programs are tied to the "...average acreage they planted in the program crop for the past five years. The result is that farmers cannot practice crop rotation without losing part of their base acreage and thereby reducing their income support payments." In addition, commodity set-aside programs, where acreage is left idle, unfortunately encourage more intensive cultivation and increased use of pesticides on remaining acreage to maximize profit. Moreover, "...fruits and vegetables rely on grading standards; cosmetic standards are generally used as a proxy for quality, resulting in increased pesticide application to control unsightly but inconsequential pest damage."

Compiled from Resources for the Future: "Herbicides in U.S. Crop Production," "Insecticides in U.S. Crop Production," and "Fungicides in Crop Production." To increase the use of herbicides that usually kill a crop, genetic engineers are altering crops such as corn, soybeans, cotton and peanuts that resist the herbicides. Herbicide-tolerant crops are the dominant focus of genetic engineering field experiments. Critics of this approach believe that herbicide-tolerant crops perpetuate agriculture's dependence on toxic chemicals.

&nbsp;<BR>

<font size=+1><B>What is Air Pollution?</B><P>

Pollution is by definition to make dirty, impure, or to corrupt.  When we
consider air pollution, we are considering the adulteration of the air, the air
we must breathe to stay alive.  At certain levels of air pollution, we die. 
Before those fatal levels, we become sick.  Children, the elderly, and those with
respiratory problems such as asthma are more susceptible to air pollution than
the general public because these people have decreased lung ability.  Air
pollution in even small quantities exacerbates their problems making it more
difficult for them to breathe.  At slightly higher levels of air pollution, even
the healthiest lungs among us are affected.<P>

<B>Why Worry?</B><P>

An EPA electronic pamphlet introduces the topic:<p>

<CITE>Why should you be concerned about air pollution?<p>

Air pollution can make you sick. It can cause burning eyes and nose and an itchy,
irritated throat, as well as trouble in breathing. Some chemicals found in
polluted air cause cancer, birth defects, brain and nerve damage and long-term
injury to the lungs and breathing passages. Some air pollutants are so dangerous
that accidental releases can cause serious injury or even death.<p>

Air pollution can damage the environment. Trees, lakes and animals have been
harmed by air pollution. Air pollutants have thinned the protective ozone layer
above the Earth; this loss of ozone could cause changes in the environment as
well as more skin cancer and cataracts (eye damage) in people.<P>

Air pollution can damage property. It can dirty buildings and other structures.
Some common pollutants eat away stone, damaging buildings, monuments and statues.<P>

Air pollution can cause haze, reducing visibility in national parks and sometime
interfering with aviation.<P></CITE>

<B>Pollution and Lungs</B><P>

Intuitively, the majority of health-related problems that result from air
pollution occur in the lungs.  As the organs of breathing, our lungs are our
interface with the air.  When we breathe, we are providing our bodies with
oxygen.  Lack of oxygen produces noticeable effects.  At higher altitudes, people
become dizzy and faint because the amount of oxygen in the air is smaller.  When
the air is polluted, not only is there less oxygen in the air, which causes
breathing difficulties, but therh levels of air pollution and increased risk of
death (by 15-17%) </font><font size =-1><A HREF="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/News/950310.html">Harvard
School of Public Health Study.</A><P></font>

<font size=+1><B>Air Pollution and Children</B><P>

For many reasons children are especially prone to the dangers of high ozone
levels.  Their lungs have narrower airways which increases chances of
obstruction.  Children have higher ventilation rates which increase the volume of
air they inhale.  They spend more time outdoors, and engage in more vigorous
physical activity, especially during the summer months, when ozone levels are
already increased.  During exercise, children and adults breathe with both their
noses and mouths, which bypasses the filters of the sinus pathway.<P>

<B>Forms of Air Pollution</B><P>

The major forms of air pollution, as established by the EPA, are ozone, sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, repirable particulate matter, and
lead.  National Ambient Air Quality Standards are set for each of these six
pollutants and are monitored by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) through a network statewide affiliates.<P>

The EPA has designated four areas in Texas that violate the national ozone
standard (120 parts per billion): Houston-Galvestion-Brazoria, Beaumont-Port
Arthur, Dallas-Fort Worth, and El Paso.  In these areas, people should be
especially aware of the adverse health effects of ozone and should alter their
behavior to compensate.  Jennifer Bartkowski of the American Lung Association
said, The number of of people who go into emergency rooms with respiratory
problems increases on days of high ozone.  She said the exact numbers are hard
to determine, but there is a definite correlation.  She reaffirmed that high
ozone levels are especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and others with
existing cardiopulminary problems.<P>


<B>Quantity of Pollutants</B><P>

Air pollution depends upon quantity.  The poisons in the dose, and with air
pollutants the doses are small.  Because the atmosphere is so big, we have in the
past been misled into thinking that whatever we put into the air will dissipate. 
In the 1800s the problem of air pollution concentrated at ground level was
recognized and smokestacks were created to vent our pollutants higher into the
sky.  The pollution was evident as black noxious clouds, its deleterious effects
were prevalent, so it was shot up and away from ourselves, but the problem didn't
end there.  Pollution depends heavily on weather conditions.  Ozone is present in
higher quantities during the summer, and low pressure systems keep air pollution
closer to the ground and less able to disperse.<P>

<B>Smog</B><P>

A familiar and still poignant example of urban air pollution is smog, like the
smog that is associated with the haze around Los Angeles.  Smog is a combination
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone (O3), which is created in atmospheric
reactions with nitrogen oxides (NO).  The visibility of smog makes it an easier
target than some forms of air pollution.  By themselves, invisible CFCs deplete
the upper atmosphere ozone layer, which is the same type of ozone that at ground
level poses other health risks.  Depleting the upper atmosphere ozone layer
allows more ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the atmosphere, increasing the
risk of skin cancer.<P>

During Dec.  5-8, 1952, a killer smog was responsible for an estimated
3,500-4,000 deaths in London.  In 1948, a stagnant air mass sent over 10 percent
of the population of Donora, Pa., to hospitals[Ibid].<P>

<B>Reducing Air Pollution</B><P>

There are many ways to decrease the amount of pollutants in the air, but
individually, the easiest ways are related to use of automobiles.  The
Environmental Protection Agency offers many suggestions in a pamphlet called
"Your Car and the Environment."  By reducing the amount of time we spend in our
cars, and increasing the number of people with which we share rides, pollutants
from engine emissions can be reduced.  The EPA suggests carpooling, bicycling to
work, and using mass transit busses and trains.  Additionally, the EPA suggests
ways to increase fuel efficiency, thereby burning less fuel and emitte are also
harmful gases and pariculate matter in the air that cause more breathing
difficulties and also can damage our lungs directly.<P>

An American Lung Association Pamphlet pamphlet states that lung disease claims
more than 300,000 lives in America every year and is the third-leading cause of
death in the United States.  Air pollution contributes to lung disease, including
respiratory tract infections, asthma, and lung cancer.  Pollutants cause the
bronchi, the tubes between the lungs esophogus,  to constrict, thereby reducing
the amoung of oxygen that we can breathe into our lungs.  Particulate matter, for
example, can also lodge in our lungs, ripping tissues and amassing
carcinogenically.  Studies show high correlations between incidence of lung
cancer and areas of high air pollution.  Even if we suffer no perceived immediate
problems in breathing, air pollution still may be shortening our lives.  A 1995
Harvard study of over half-a-million people in 151 U.S. cities found positive
correlation between higing less pollution.  Combine trips, keep tires properly
inflated, keep car filters and catalytic converters clean, accelerate gradually,
and have the emissions system inspected regularly are all suggestions offered by
the EPA.<P>

Conserving electricity at home and work also helps to reduce air pollution. 
Electricity is widely generated by coal-fired plants which emit air pollution. 
By conserving electricity, the demand for coal to be burned is lessened as a
result.  Similarly, increasing reliance on sustainable energy sources (such as
the sun and wind) decreases reliance on polluting energy sources, almost
exclusively from oil- and coal-derived hydrocarbon fuels.<P>

In the meantime, as we continue trying to reduce air pollution, it is important
to consider levels of air pollution when spending time outdoors, especially when
engaging in strenuous activity.<P>

</CENTER> <BR CLEAR=ALL>


&nbsp;<BR>

<font size=+1>Ozone is a molecule having a split personality.  In the upper stratosphere we have the good ozone that protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. In
the lower troposphere at ground level, ozone, the main component of smog, is a
toxic gas that aggravates lung problems. It can make normal breathing more
difficult and can contribute to the premature death of people with heart and lung
disease.  Symptoms can be much worse for older people, babies, asthmatics or
anyone who doesn't have normal resistance to bacteria and viruses.  Scientific
studies are also showing that air pollution can have long-term effects on lung
capacity and even the development of lung disease itself.  Our lungs defend us
against air pollution, but air pollution places an additional stress on the
body's defenses making us more susceptible to disease.<P>

The Clean AIR Force, a coalition of public and private entities committed to
improving air quality, encourages individuals to take action to help reduce air
pollutants and thus keep ground level ozone at healthy levels.  One simple rule
of thumb is to reduce the use of any gasoline burning engine.  That means driving
less and using gasoline powered equipment like lawnmowers, jet skis, power boats,
etc. less.<P>

Exceeding the federal standard of 120 parts of ozone per billion, four days
within a three year period could result in nonattainment status and economic
sanctions.  The 120 ppb guideline is considered unhealthy by the federal
government, but several studies cited by the American Lung Association also show
health problems at 80 ppb, and EPA is currently studying the standard.<P>



Ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and nitrogen oxide
emissions react in sunlight. Temperatures in the 90's, no clouds in the sky, and
not a breath of wind are conditions favorable to ozone formation.<P>

One of the major man-controlled culprits of ozone is transportation.  Since the
early 70's emissions from new vehicles have been going down, but the big problem
is that we are putting more and more vehicles on our roadways, and the overload
is beginning to take its toll. This coupled with the fact that older cars
generally emit more pollutants is offsetting technological gains.  The new cars
of today produce 60-80 percent less pollution than a car of the 60's.<P>

Mass transit is definitely one solution as is carpooling, biking, walking,
telecommuting.  Living close to work should be a major consideration. Purchasing
vehicles that get better gas mileage or that run on cleaner fuels like compressed
natural gas is also part of the solution.  Over a car's life a car that gets 27.5
mpg will emit 37.71 tons of CO2 whereas a car that gets only 18 mpg will emit
57.75 tons.<P>

Combine errands.  More than half of auto emissions come from just starting up the
car therefore bicycling or walking short distances can make a major contribution
toward cleaner air.  The emissions from one poorly maintained vehicle equals the
emissions from 25 properly functioning maintained vehicles so that too can make a
major contribution.  The same goes for lawnmower and boat motors.<P>

'Topping off' the gas tank when you go past the first click should be a thing of
the past.  Those excess vapors contribute to air pollution.<P>





Dirty air is very expensive in terms of health costs and sick days from work and
thus lost productivity.  The American Lung Association estimates that the health
costs associated with outdoor air pollution alone are 40 to 50 billion a year. 
So even the people who are not presently experiencing lung problems pay the
price.  "If we can't breathe, nothing else matters."<P>

<font size=+1>Ozone is the most prevalent air pollution problem in Texas and across the nation. The Ozone Action Days Program supports communities that encourage citizens to voluntarily take steps to reduce this air pollutant. <P>

Through the program, meteorologists at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) forecast when conditions will be right to produce high ozone concentrations in seven metropolitan areas. Forecasts are issued by 2 p.m. the day before expected high levels.  Community coalitions incorporate this information into local campaigns that urge the public, businesses and industry to reduce ozone pollution.<P>

The ozone season in Texas is from April through October. During the 1996 season, forecasts are being issued for <A href="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185G.html">Austin, </A><A HREF="http:// www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185F.html">Beaumont-Port Arthur, </A> <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185E.html">Corpus Christi, </A> <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185D.html">Dallas-Fort Worth,  </A> <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185B.html">Houston-Galveston-Brazoria</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185A.html">San Antonio</A>
.  (TNRCC also keeps online data for <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185C.html">El Paso</A>  but does not make forecasts for the area at this ti me.)<P>

To forecast an Ozone Action Day, TNRCC staff members compare an area's weather forecast for the next day to area weather conditions found during previous high ozone days. They rely on the National Weather Service's forecast of the next day's wind direction, wind speed, temperature, cloud cover, and probability of precipitation. They also consider whether the area's current ozone level is high, because it can indicate what the next day's concentration will be.<P>

Ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds combine in sunlight. Sources of these pollutants include fuel-burning engines in cars and lawn mowers, as well as some industry and power plants. Hot, sunny summer days with little wind are perfect for ozone formation.<P>

At the request of some communities, the TNRCC will  re-evaluate the ozone and weather conditions on the morning of an Ozone Action Day, and cancel the forecast if necessary.<P>

If you live in one of the participating communities and want to check on Ozone Action Day forecasts, call the TNRCC's toll free environmental hotline at 1-800-64TEXAS. It is updated each morning and afternoon. <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.texas.gov/updated/air/monops/query-form.html">Forecast information and ozone concentrations</A> measured by the TNRCC in Texas communities can be found on the Internet. This information is updated daily.<P>

The TNRCC provides web sites with general information about air quality in <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/admin/topdoc/gi/185.html">Texas.</A><P>

<H2>Types of Air Pollution</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/tinyglobe.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Globe">

<B>Smog</B> is an often visible haze made up of thousands of constituents, the
most abundant, but not necessarily the most toxic of which is ozone. Ozone,
especially at elevated levels, can create breathing problems particularly in the
young, the old and persons with existing health problems by reducing lung
function, increasing sensitivity to asthma and aging lung tissue. It is suspected
to irritate the eyes, cause nasal congestion and reduce resistance to colds and
other infections. Ozone at elevated levels is toxic to other living organisms as
well; it damages plants and trees by affecting the stability of cell walls.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Particulate matter</B>, produced by the burning of wood, diesel and other
fuels, by agricultural activities and industrial processes and by traffic on
unpaved roads, is made up of ash, smoke, soot, dust, fibers and liquid droplets.
Particulate matter produces a haze that can cause visibility problems. It also
dirties and damages buildings and clothes. Smaller particulates, which float in
the air, can be inhaled deeply and, with elevated concentrations over an extended
period of time, can cause lung damage and bronchitis.Recent studies have linked
exposure to these smallest particles to a greater risk of premature death. 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Nitrogen oxides </B>result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural
gas, gasoline and oil. At present, automobiles are the main source of nitrogen
oxide emissions in urban areas. Nitrogen oxides, at elevated concentrations, can
damage the respiratory system. They also can be a key ingredient in the
formation of both ozone and acid rain.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Sulfur dioxide </B>is released when sulfur-containing fuels like coal and oil
are burned. Common sources <BR> of sulfur dioxide emissions are electric
utilities <BR> and certain industrial processes. Sulfur dioxide at  elevated
concentrations can cause respiratory problems. It also can be a contributing component of
acid rain.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Toxic chemicals such as benzene, toluene and 1,1,1 trichloroethane</B>, when
present in the air that we breathe in elevated concentrations over time, can
cause various health effects including birth defects, cancer and other health
problems. Sources of toxic emissions include industrial processes, such as
refineries and chemical manufacturers, small businesses such as printers and dry
cleaners and automobiles.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</B> is formed when fuel does not burn completely. Cars
and trucks are the main contributors. Carbon monoxide interferes with the
blood's ability to transport oxygen to cells <BR> and tissues. Exposure to
elevated levels of carbon monoxide can cause drowsiness, headaches and sometimes
death. Carbon monoxide is particularly hazardous to those who have heart disease
or pre-existing lung conditions.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Lead</B> is a heavy metal that persists in the environment for decades.
The former use of leaded gasoline, which is no longer commercially available in most of the United
States, the manufacture of lead-based paint and lead-acid battery reclamation
operations are sources of lead in the air. Emissions from metal smelters are
another source. Exposure to lead at high levels and over time can cause
brain and other nervous system damage, particularly in children. Excess
exposure to lead can also harm wildlife and is known to cause cancer in
animals. 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B>Acid Rain</B> forms when the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon
dioxide emitted from fossil fuel-burning plants and other combustion 
processes combine with rain, fog or snow in the atmosphere. Over time, with
conducive geologic conditions, acid rain can increase the acidities of lakes,
streams and soils, disturbing or destroying local environments. Wind can carry
pollutants far away from where they originated, creating  problems in
other states or countries.

<IMG SRC="images/tires.gif" ALIGN="right" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="100" ALT="[Stack of Tires]">
Everything is bigger
and better in Texas.  This has long been a point of pride with Texans. 
Unfortunately, it relates to more than Dooley trucks and Stetson hats; it also
holds true for smog, pollution and levels of dangerous toxins.  <P>

Texas currently
holds the title of second most polluted state in the Union.  Yet recently, a number of cement kilns have received permits to power the
cement-making process with TDF, or "tire derived fuel."  Tires are burned as a fuel source, and many call this process "recycling."<P>

Cement kilns around the country using TDF claim
that tires burn cleaner and safer than coal.  They like to call it
"recycling" because they are reclaiming the energy value of the tire without
causing any harm to the environment.  However, the foundation of  this claim lies
in a test done by the EPA in 1991 which did not look for emissions beyond those
expected from coal.  Tires and coal are two entirely different substances; in
fact, it is impossible to tell what a specific tire contains because many
companies use different recipes in manufacturing them.  <P>

Statewide rules require commercial incinerators to employ advanced technology to
combat toxic emissions.  Cement kilns, on the other hand, are not equipped with
the more advanced technology, including scrubbers in the stack to prevent
build-up, dual incinerators for more efficient destruction, and constant
monitoring of the stack output which the state requires for commercial
incinerators.  Nor are cement kilns required to adhere to air quality laws that
incinerators must follow; their permitted emission rates are much higher.<P>

The truth is, burning
tires emits hundreds of toxic compounds into the air, some of the worst of which
- dioxins, furans, PCBs - are known to cause cancer as well as major reproductive
and immunological problems, even if present in very small amounts.  One stack
test at a kiln burning 30% TDF found major increases in a number of pollutants as
compared to 100% coal.  These include a 1432% increase in dioxins, 2230% increase
in furans, 388% increase in lead, the list goes on and is quite shocking.  The
heavy metals, such as lead, chromium, nickel, and cadmium tend to bind with the
particulate matter that is inevitable at a cement kiln.  When absorbed by the
lungs, the metals dissolve into soluble salts which can easily penetrate the
brain.  Exposure can also lead to respiratory irritation and asthma, two ailments
found increasingly in communities with cement kilns. <P>

 Americans discard 240 million tires every year, leaving us with stacks upon
stacks of tires.  The State of Texas assesses a $2 fee attached to the price of
all new tires, with the intention that the money be used to develop uses for
scrap tires.  Instead of encouraging entrepreneurs to find new and safe uses, the
State of Texas gives cement kilns 80 cents per tire to burn them, and calls it
recycling.  This eliminates a large portion of the budget for safe, effective
uses and pits cement kilns against upstart companies with other alternatives.  <P>

Granted, used tires are becoming a major problem, but incineration
is not the answer.  The Scrap Tire Management Council has developed many viable
alternatives.  Perhaps the most creative is in artificial reefs.  Using up to 2
million tires, artificial reefs can be created to provide habitat to fish.  With
their shock absorption value, tires also make excellent breakwaters to reduce
impact erosion on the shoreline.  <P>

On land, materials from shredded tires can be
used in paving road surface.  Rubber modified asphalt concrete (RUMAC) lasts two
to three times longer than conventional asphalt.  The list of products that can
be made from tires is actually quite long:  mats, flooring, tennis shoe soles,
dock bumpers, truck bed liners, even houses have been made with old tires. 
Perhaps the best alternative is keeping the tires out of the waste stream
entirely by retreading.  At least 38 million tires in use now could benefit from
retreading, adding years to the life of the tire.<P>

Incineration is the
worst means of destroying any form of waste, especially tires.  The pollution
that results puts entire communities at risk, children in particular.  Newborn
and young children are the most susceptible to the adverse effects of pollution. 
Given the numerous and useful alternatives, the millions of tires stacked around
Texas need to become valuable products, not toxic pollution.<P>

<font size=+1>
"I'm not an original tree hugger, although I love trees now and occassionally
speak to them," Sue Johnson says as she sips her iced coffee.<P>

"I've always been a hiker, camper, rock collector. And I like to garden," she
adds. "I've always had some tie to nature, but most of my life I did not consider
myself an environmentalist."<P>

The assertion surprises me, coming from one of Central Texas' most respected and
active environmental advocates.  Board chair of Ecology Action, elected board
member of the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation District, and
co-founder of the Environmental Sociology Section of the American Sociological
Association, Sue's resume reads like a who's-who listing of outstanding
environmentalists.<P>

Her thoughtful expression reflects back to me as she stares out the cafe window.
"I want to resist the title environmentalist because what I feel I'm about is
more than just environmentalism."<P>

Ecology Action is coordinating Austin's Earth Day 1996 celebration, and with her
close ties to some two dozen other environmental organizations in Austin, Sue
seemed like the perfect interview for GreenBeat!'s Earth Day cover story.<P>

She has a reputation as a solution-finder, win-win-moderator, and naysayer to the
word "impossible." I wanted to know her opinions on the present condition and
future of the environmental movement.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/quote.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=78 ALT="quote">


"I think environmentalists these days have a kind of reactionary reputation. I
don't want that. They're seen as somehow obstructionists and negative," Sue
frowns, pauses for a moment then brightens. "Nature is so positive! It (present
environmentalism) seems the antithesis. Nature is life and positivism and
ever-changing movement."<P>

Bringing life, positivism and ever-changing movement to Austin's environmental
politics was Sue's mission when she co-created the Community Results Group.<P>

"There's tremendous fragmentation in the environmental movement. I basically see
it as there's those who are focused on problems versus those focused on
solutions." she observes. "When you're problem-oriented you become an expert in
the problem, not the solution."<P>

The Community Results Group is an experiential learning course
teaching participants to focus their energies and attention on results that they
want to create.
<P>
"The nucleus of the Community Results Group was we wanted to do something about
solving the conflict between environmentalists and developers," Sue explains. "So
the first class was evenly divided between  environmentalists and developers and
then some neutral people like the chair of the chamber of commerce."<P>

During the six-week course, participants meet three hours weekly, engage in
homework assignments such as listening to tapes, writing in their workbooks, and
reading. Each person focuses on a vision for their personal life.<P>

"And what happens to everyone who takes the course is that during the six weeks
you start to see movement towards your results. And it gives you a real feeling
that you can really create your life as oppossed to having your life created for
you by other people," Sue continues. As individuals learn to implement these
strategies in their own lives, then they are able to apply similar strategies in
their work together.<P>

"People who seem light-years away from you, if you search long enough there are
areas of agreement and you can use that as the basis for beginning to build
trust. And then what happens is that there is moderating of the polarities."<P>

"You start by asking the group 'if anything in the world were possible what would
you want this to look like?' And so there you have your vision and then it's just
a matter of how you go about implementing your vision," she explains.<P>

"You have to really know what you've got now; be very clear about what your
vision of the future is; and don't necessarily focus on the process of how to get
there," Sue advises. "We may not know how all of this is going to happen but we
will all be open to all the possibilities."<P>

Sue hopes that more individuals working for the environment will adopt
results-oriented strategies. "We would all be more effective if we all came
together around solution-oriented projects."<P>

Along with adopting solution-oriented strategies, Sue hopes that the
environmental movement also will adopt strategies for assisting people to
personally connect with nature.<P>

"Earth Day itself doesn't need to be transformed because it's perfectly good as
what it is. But what I would be interested in is to make people aware how
disconnected they are from nature. That is really a more important change to
enable," Sue explains.<P>

"We ought to have Earth Day for community building, community reinforcement,
seeing all your friends," Sue continues. "With all the exhibitors, you can
certainly learn new things. So it's a level of involvement that is fine. But it's
not the most fundamental one that I think Earth Day could really mean."<P>

"A lot of the problems we have could be solved by people reaffirming their
connection with nature," Sue explains. "But most people don't realize that part
of their maliase is due to this disconnection. Nobody thinks about it in those
terms."<P>

"Little kids are connected to nature. And we tend to lose that as we get older.
But there is a fundamental connection.  I think the real purpose of Earth Day
ought to be to help people get back in tune with nature. So to me the ideal Earth
Day would not be what we do at the park. We'd all go lay on the banks of the
Pedernales River or do rituals to the sun," Sue laughs.<P>

"What I'm talking about now is spirituality and a spirit connection. When we talk
about environmentalists we're talking about community and politics. There are
different levels of discourse."<P>

With the coffee glasses cleared and the check paid, Sue concludes her thoughts.
"We need these paradigm shifts. Sustainability is entirely possible -- we can save
the earth through our choices."<P>

We walk out into the warm March day for me to take a picture of Sue. Smiling,
with a halo of sunshine around her, she hugs the nearest oak tree.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>Environmental Holiday</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Is Earth Day like Christmas?</FONT><P>
by Max Woodfin<BR> 
<P>


</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Do you remember where you were on the first Earth Day?  Even among ardent
environmentalists, April 22, 1970, was not quite a signal event in the manner
of the Kennedy assassination, the day Nixon resigned or the Challenger
disaster.<P>

		I happen to remember where I was, because I was doing exactly what I'm doing
right now: writing about Earth Day. I had an assignment to write a newspaper
article about the role of organized religion in the environmental movement.<P>

		One of the ministers I interviewed made a remark that at the time I laughed
at, but later found incredibly insightful. To paraphrase, he hoped  Earth Day
would not become to environmentalism what Christmas Day had become to
Christianity.<P>

        What did he mean?<P>
        
        There's a syndrome known as "once-a-year Christianity," for those who show up
in church around the holiday season but aren't seen the rest of the year. The
syndrome isn't limited to Christianity, it just happened to be a Christian who
provided the analogy.<P>

        I wondered how we had fared these 26 years in his judgment. I tracked him
down to a nursing home, where I was told he didn't have the energy for
telephone conversations.<P> 

        I tried to imagine what I would have reported to him, had we been able to
discuss the state of environmentalism.<P>

        The good news is that more people are aware of environmental problems today
than 26 years ago. In our country, we have clean air and clean water
legislation that has slowed and in some cases reversed pollution problems.
We've made advances in the general knowledge about the dangers of pesticides.
(But we're still exporting pesticides that are illegal in the United States.
That's environmental racism of the worst degree.) Superfund programs are
notorious for feeding lawyers and consultants, but a few hot spots are cleaned
up and we seem to be creating fewer new priority sites. We're recycling more,
reusing more and in some instances reducing the use of raw materials.<P>

		Some of the bad news is that an inordinate amount of our energy is directed at 
what the late Edward Abbey called the common cold of environmental pollution --
litter. I'm all for clean roadsides and tidy parks, but do you ever wonder if we
couldn't have found a more profound use for all that money that went into "Don't
Mess With Texas?" We've let the polluters lull us into a feel-good ethic; we
think if we spend a day picking up trash we're having an effect on pollution.
Until our collective consciousness realizes that it's mostly the stuff we can't
see that really hurts, we're much like those Christmas Day Christians.<P>

        What would the minister's advice be for Earth Day 1996? He would probably
tell us to celebrate the day, to enjoy the companionship of others who share
our values. I also think he would tell us to wake up the next morning and try
to make a real difference. Because he's a Christian, he would probably tell us
to be missionaries: to run for office ourselves, or help put good people
there; to get appointed to boards and commissions and advisory groups so that
our voices are heard on the inside as well as the outside.<P>

        He would tell us to write thoughtful letters to the editor; to demand clean
and safe working conditions; to be less wasteful. He would probably refer us
to his prophet and remind us that John Muir wasn't the first to muse about how
everything in this world is linked together.<BR>

ALIGN=left WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=184><P><BR>&nbsp;<BR> <FONT SIZE=+3><B>Let the Earth
Speak:</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A 10-Minute Earth Day
Activity</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=+2>From Michael J. Cohen and<BR>Project Nature
Connect</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=+1><I>by Dan Horowitz</I></FONT>

</CENTER> <BR CLEAR=ALL>


&nbsp;<BR>

<font size=+1>Helping people to connect with nature and to heighten their sensory awareness,
Michael Cohen uses Project Nature Connect to revive natural instincts which have been
dulled by the phantasmagoric abstractions of modern life.  Cohen shows people 
that they are disconnected from the planet and from themselves, and to uses
ecotherapy to help them reconnect.  Cohen says Let the Earth Speak is "a sampling
 of the experience and thought in the project."<P>

The activity is planned in conjunction with Earth Day, but is intended to be used
any and every day. The activity only takes ten minutes, and although Cohen refers
to it as a "secret" method, it is not really hidden from us, except by ourselves.
The entire activity, as written by Cohen, can be seen from his <A
HREF="http://pacificrim.net/~nature">Project Nature Connect</A> Web page, but in
brief the idea is to communicate with nature.  Communication in this sense
is not of human language, however.  It is a deeper-brained activity that works
through sensory experience.<P>

The first part of the activity is to admit or realize that communication without
language is possible, and indeed foremost in nature. Admit and accept this
challenge.  Then, Cohen tells us, after realizing that Nature speaks to us,  go
to nature and listen.  He suggests going to "the most unspoiled natural
environment available to you, be it a potted
plant, weed, pet, backyard, park, or sanctuary."  Try to know the place or
object without words, by seeing it, listening to it, and feeling it.  Repeat
 the word "attraction" until you feel
an attraction to the object or place.  Note how good the attraction feels, then
try to express it in written language.  Then, Cohen instructs, "read your statement 
to yourself with others and/or share it with others."
He offers you a chance to post your statement to share with others online, anonymously 
if you wish.  Many people
have already submitted their experiences.
  Finally, Cohen asks that you reflect on the experience to find its meaning in your 
  life.<P>

The Earth Day activity is based on years of experience Cohen has gained from living and
working outside and from the lessons and therapies he has used to reinforce his
instincts.  He has written several books and numerous articles on the subject and
many people have used his methods to reconnect with nature.  Cohen considers his
ecotherapy public domain.  He says anyone who uses his methods "owns" them and
can use them any time. Because Earth Day is supposed to be a day for reviving
environmental and ecological consciousness, the activity Cohen suggests is
especially relevant.<P>

Millions of people will be doing things for Earth Day and the week around it, but
even in these activities most of these people will probably be awash in the
symbolic world of language.  Language is a human invention so its necessary to go
behind it, to the natural world we know through our sensations in order to connect with
nature. There are more than just the five
sensations we usually consider.  Cohen says we have more than 50 sensations, and
he includes color, thirst, hunger and the desire to breathe along with the
traditional sensations of sight, hearing, smelling, etc.  Opening ourselves up to
these less recognized sensations and to the Earth in the process is a way to heal
ourselves.  The stress we feel in our daily lives is often a sign that we've
become disconnected with natural processes.  It can be alleviated through
conscious communion with nature.<P>

Cohen's Earth Day Activity and the other
activities he teaches aim to alleviate this stress, as a way and form of
meditation. There are essentially two parts to our brains, Cohen notes, the old
brain limbic system and the new brain, or neo-cortex.  Language is a function of
the neo-cortex which surrounds the older, sensation-processing limbic system. 
Because our sensations are associated with the limbic system, which developed
earlier in evolution, we have been connected to nature longer through our senses.  
"We have injured our sensory inner nature to the point that we are insensitive
to reality, and are thereby runaway," says Cohen. "The new brain is disconnected 
from the old brain by language."<P>

On an evolutionary scale, our ability to mediate our sensory experience with
language is newer, and subordinate.  However, Cohen says, we have increasingly
become reliant on our new-brain processing, largely because we spend 95 percent of
our lives indoors and because we know nature for 99 percent of our adult lives
through stories and pictures of nature, and not from nature itself. Pictures and
stories of nature are no substitutes for sensory experience of nature.  Stress
is largely a result of people trying to make this substitution, Cohen says.<P>

People become stressed because of incongruencies between the two parts of their
brains.  For example, quickly say the color of each of the following words
outloud:<P> <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/connect.gif" ALT="Word Color Test"
ALIGN=center WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=80></CENTER><BR CLEAR:ALL> Cohen uses this test to show that most people 
will say the name of the word before its color.  Until
they read correctly the word green, which is written in green ink, people report
feeling stressed. This comes, Cohen says, because people sense the correct color,
but the verbal label contradicts it.  He
says teaching people to be aware of the differences between their sensations and
their language processing teaches them to be more aware of how they are experiencing 
the world.  Greater awareness is the way to greater connection and greater connection
is the way to less stress.<P>

Let The Earth Speak, Cohen's Earth Day activity, is a way to accomplish the same
stress-reducing goal. Go to <A HREF="http://pacificrim.net/~nature">Project Nature
 Connect</A> to read
the Earth Day Avtivity in full and spend a little well-needed and well-deserved
time reconnecting to nature, today and especially on Earth Day.  Then, send
your comments to Micheal Cohen and read what others have said about their
experiences of connection.<P>

Paul Levine, a children's music composer/teacher in Ft.Collins, CO
submitted the previous song which he wrote a few years ago for a major
international eco-conference, Voices of the Earth.  Since it's use as theme music
for that event it has been sung by thousands at events around the country and the
world - conferences, schools, churches - even at ecologically-oriented
weddings!  He hopes it will become an anthem for Earth Day and the world-wide 
environmental movement.<P>

If you would like a copy of the sheet music, Paul will send them for free.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Making A Better World</FONT><P>
by Miriam Weinstein<BR> 
ENVJOBS-L Listserv Manager <BR>
editor, Making A Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You 
Make A Better World<br>
</CENTER>

<P>
<font size=+1>

Do you feel your life has a purpose? If your purpose is healing, to help heal
life on this planet, please don't wait, or figure that someone else will do it.
You are truly needed.
<P>
Are you thinking about what kind of work you really want? Maybe your service is
to become an environmental lawyer, a policy planner. or to implement greener
manufacturing processes. Maybe your integrity is to develop sustainable forestry
plans. Maybe it's to help inner city kids make it through college.
<P>
Maybe you'll
even do that by becoming wealthy, and having money to donate. Maybe it's to write
about indigenous cultures, and help protect them and their knowledge. Perhaps you
want to teach. 
<P>
Maybe you don't have a clue, you just know you want to make a
difference. But you do know the right college education can make a vital
difference.
<P>
Your college choice process then is framed around very different questions than
most people ask themselves. It's not merely "Will I get a top education, or
a prestigious name education, how's the football, will it get me a decent or a
top paying job, or, even, will this get my parents off my back?" 
<P>
Your questions
are "will this college help me figure out what my work is," or "will this college
provide me with what I need to do my work to make a better world," and "does this
college support my values?"
<P>
And for each of you, what you need may be very different. Some of you may need
technical skills, some of you will want colleges rich in community based
service-learning, some of you may be planning on graduate school, while some may
need emotional healing and nurturing. 
<P>
The truth is, however, most of you probably
don't know exactly what you need - and you don't have to. Life's path often has
a way of revealing itself in slow twists and turns, and other times, in a moment
of sparkling insight.
<P>
When you are considering a college look at all the usual things: its academic
caliber, its location, majors and courses, and accessibility of professors. But
also learn if it has an ethic of service, concerns for peace and social justice,
an environmental focus, and how these concerns are brought into the classroom and
the world. How strong is the college on interdisciplinary and experiential
education? 
<P>
Then ask yourself - will this college give me what I need in order to
fulfill my purpose? I believe  if you want to use your education to make a better
world, it's a great advantage to attend a college where you really fit in.
<P>

There
are nearly 100 distinctive colleges and programs profiled in the book <B>Making A
Difference College Guide</B>. These colleges can
really direct you, give you the skills, tools, self-trust, and connections you'll
need. 
<P>
Colleges in <B>Making A Difference College Guide</B> are committed to and actively
engaged in helping solve our world's complex and pressing needs, both in and out
of the classroom. There are state colleges and universities, tiny independent
colleges, innovative schools, summer institutes, all kinds of programs. You can
take courses taught by teams of teachers from different disciplines, or design
you own major incorporating your own interests in your own particular way. 
<P>
One
things for sure: all the colleges you'll read about offer a vital, relevant
education. Reading this article will give you an idea of what to look for at any
college you are considering. 
<P>
Find a college with opportunities to learn while
doing service, and get college credit at the same time. Imagine working in a
health clinic in a remote part of Nepal, assisting migrant laborers in the South,
teaching sustainable agriculture in Central America,  or building water cisterns
at a school in the African countryside. 
<P>
You might help monitor a local river for
pollution using a new experimental technique, save a threatened species such as
the peregrine falcon, or sail on a clipper ship to study marine mammals. You
might design urban affordable housing, or erect a building out of straw bales.
<P>
You can spend two weeks at a Mayan village, study in Ecuadoran rainforests,
student teach at Native American reservations, tutor inner city kids, or have a
say in local development plans in Maine. 
<P>
College students who are out of the
ivory tower get a truly interdisciplinary real wor! ld education, the opportunity
to try out their career interests, and job contacts which often turn into a job
offer upon graduation.
<P>
<B>Making A Difference College Guide</B>  emphasizes meaningful career-oriented studies.
The more specialized your area of study, the easier it is to find work. Experts
are quick to note, however, the more "liberal" or broad your studies are, the
more flexible you'll be in your career opportunities over the years. And although
studies such as social work, peace, urban planning, and natural resources are the
ones listed in the book- students who major in traditional liberal arts such as
English gain critical thinking skills beneficial to an environmental career, or
specialize further in graduate school. 
<P>
Another source you can look at is
<B>Peterson's Education for the Earth</B>.  This book looks at many different
environmental majors at colleges nationwide - but it does not take into
consideration the culture of the college. There are substantial advantages at the
smallest hidden-gem college as well as the Ivy Leagues. 
<P>
Many of the socially
committed colleges are small, undergraduate-centered, and have approachable
faculty who care more about teaching than research. Universities, on the other
hand, offer a mind-boggling array of majors, greater opportunities to participate
in advanced research, and vast resources. 
<P>
Many parents fear that making a
difference means a life of poverty. We all know that nowadays, a college degree
doesn't guarantee a job, much less a secure, interesting or high paying one. It's
also true that if you're looking to make a better world, and if you are
persistent in seeking it out, there is a meaningful career waiting for you. 
<P>
Your piece of the
puzzle could be an essential one for determining what kind of a future you and
the generations to come will have. 
<P>
If you parents need some prodding to be
supportive, perhaps you can get them to pick up a copy of <B>Earth in Mind</B> by
Oberlin professor David Orr, published by Island Press. This is a deeply
thoughtful book about  higher education - and it just may help do the trick.
<P>

Ultimately it may not matter how prestigious a college is, what matters is if it
is the right college for you. 
<P>
For you personally, for the world around you, the
choices now before you are pivotal ones. It's not the schools prestige, but your
wish to count for something that will matter in years to come. 
<P>
Choose a college
that will guide and support you, while giving you the tools you need to give the
best within you, and you'll be well on your way to contributing to a better
world.

Planting trees, designing Web pages, leading hikes, writing news 
articles...These are but a few of the many things you can do to help out 
a community environmental organization.  Almost every single 
environmental group in your community will have a way to use volunteers 
or interns, and all you have to do is ASK them.<P>

In general, there are two levels of volunteering, short-term or 
single-event activities, and longer term intern type work.<P>

<H4>Short Term Opportunities</H4>
Many environmental groups need help with big, well-publicized events.  
This might be an Earth Day activity, fundraising event, or clean-up day.  
Many areas have local 'beautification days,' which require much more than 
simple manual labor.  Groups need volunteers to help out with the event's 
organization, publicity, and staffing.  Often they will require a 
short-term commitment of only a few hours a week for a few weeks.  In 
return, you'll usually get to meet some really exciting people, learn 
about how big events are organized behind the scenes, and give something 
back to the environment.  You can also use these events to learn about a 
group that you are interested in working for.  Sometimes, short-term 
volunteer opportunities can lead to intern positions, good contacts, and 
even a good job. <P> 

<H4>Getting Involved</H4>
How do you find out about these activities?  The best way is to keep your 
eyes and ears open - many events are publicized in local papers, 
newsletters, or on the radio.  If you don't hear about an activity in 
time to help with the planning, be sure to go to the event and introduce 
yourself to the people who look like they're in charge.  Tell them you'd 
like to volunteer, and you should see their eyes light up.  Any 
legitimate environmental group will ask you for your phone number if they 
don't ask you to help out right then.  And if they don't call you, it's 
not because they don't need your help - they probably just lost your 
number.  Call them back and see what volunteer opportunities are 
available.  <P>

        Another good way to get involved is to call your local volunteer 
center - just look up the number in the white pages.  Environmental 
groups, especially larger ones, often use volunteer centers to get 
community help for an event.  Many local volunteer centers will ask you 
what type of volunteer activities you're interested in, and then they'll 
match your request with the available opportunities.<P>
        The key here is to be outgoing - no group is going to call you up 
and ask you to volunteer if they don't know who you are.  Be persistent.
<P>

<H4>Long Term Options</H4>
Volunteering for a community environmental group on a longer term basis 
can often be more rewarding to you and the group.  Many local grassroots 
organizations are in a constant struggle for manpower, energy, and 
funding.  You can help them out by volunteering your time or expertise. <P> 

<H4>What Are Your Options?</H4>  
Often people are interested in volunteering for an environmental group - 
any group.  How do you know what opportunities are out there?  Here's a 
partial list of what might be available in your area:<P>

 <H4>Small Issue-Oriented Local Grassroots Groups</H4>
Often small groups of citizens get together to form a group with a single 
purpose - to promote clean water or organic gardening, publicize the 
dangers of a hazardous waste site, or care for injured animals, to name a 
few examples.  These organizations have a crucial role in protecting our 
environment, and can be very rewarding to work for.  These groups 
sometimes are run out of membersU homes or offices, but every group is 
different.<P>

<H4>Established Coalition and Quasi-Governmental Groups</H4>
These organizations are usually a little older and better established.  
They are less activist, but probably have better funding, an office, and 
more contacts.  Also included here are groups that get both public and 
private funding.    <P>

<H4>Local Chapters of National Groups</H4>
The Sierra Club, Clean Water Action, Environmental Defense Fund, National 
Audubon Society, Campaign for the Environment (PIRG), and many other 
national environmental groups have local offices around the country.  
Their staff is professional, and their mission usually well-defined.  
Sometimes volunteers for these groups can be hired later on for a more 
permanent position. <P>
</UL>

<H4>OK, So What Would I be Doing?</H4>
Volunteering or interning for any of the above groups includes a wide 
variety of office related tasks.  You will often be asked to fill a 
number of roles, like answering phones, writing articles for newsletters, 
doing bulk mail, managing a member database, or planning a fundraising 
event.  Even though you might be stuck in an office, your help is 
crucial.  Students, especially college students, are very useful in these 
roles for a number of reasons.  First, they can work odd hours for little 
or no pay.  Second, and more importantly, students often have computer 
skills that many older activists don't have.  Simple things like creating 
a database, laying out a newsletter, or designing a web page can seem 
like insurmountable tasks for small groups with little computer literacy.<P>


<H4>Forget the Office, I Want To Work Outside or With Animals</H4>
If you'd rather not work in an office or as an activist, there are 
opportunities to volunteer with nature oriented groups.  For 
instance, most arboretums and nature centers need volunteers to lead 
nature hikes and other educational activities.  Often called docents, 
these volunteers are trained by the center and can make a visitor's 
experience much more meaningful.  Another opportunity is to find a local 
animal shelter, where you might have the chance to work with injured or 
misplaced wildlife.  There are groups that take care of everything from 
dolphins to cats to owls.  Finally, most areas also have plant and 
organic gardening groups that need your help as well.<P>

 
<H4>What's In It For Me?</H4>
You probably want to volunteer or intern for noble reasons, like simply 
helping out the environment.  But the fact is you will get many tangible 
and intangible rewards by working for any of these groups.  Crucial job 
skills, like phone and office communication, writing, fundraising, and 
initiative are high on the list.  Another big plus is contacts; more so 
than in other fields, working in the environmental sector is sometimes 
managed by who you know.  This doesn't mean that new people can't get 
involved, but it does mean that when looking for new hires, most groups 
like to look for people who already have experience, especially from 
volunteering for their own group.  On the soft side, you'll find that 
volunteering for community environmental groups will earn you good 
friends and lots of  personal satisfaction.   "Working on the front 
lines" will make you proud of what you do.  Finally, you'll be helping 
the environment - your environment - every hour that you work.<P>
 
<H4>How Do I Get In?</H4>
Finding a good volunteer or intern position can sometimes be exasperating 
- but don't give up.  Most groups are afraid of spending time training a 
volunteer, only to find that they can't give as much time as originally 
agreed upon.  Some good places to look for these positions include 
volunteer centers, university financial aid offices, and each 
organization's newsletter.  If there is a coalition group in your area, 
contact them to find out if they know of opportunities in other groups.  
They can also give you a list of groups in your area and how to contact 
them.  Increasingly, environmental groups are getting web pages, so 
surfing may turn up something as well. <P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>ENVJOBS-L</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A Public Forum For Global Position Announcements</FONT><P>
by Bernhard Lorenz<BR> 
ENVJOBS-L Listserv Manager <BR>
Manager of <a href=http://www.iconsult.at/> Internet Consult</a><BR>and
Technical Contact for  the
<a href=http://www.cedar.univie.ac.at/> International Society for
Environmental Protection</a>.<br>
</CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>


&nbsp;<BR>

<font size=+1>
<p><b>Introduction</b><p>

</font>
The envjobs-l has been created due to heavy demand for a separate job list on
<b>enveng-l</b> (enveng-l@cedar.univie.ac.at). 
<a href=http://www.cedar.univie.ac.at/> CEDAR</a>, Europe's biggest 
Online Environmental Exchange, already hosting mailing lists with 
several thousand people,
agreed to start another list, for job announcements and resumes only:<p>
<b><i>
envjobs-l@cedar.univie.ac.at<p>
</b></i>

Since its creation in spring 1995, envjobs-l has attracted more than 4200
subscribers looking for and offering jobs.<p>
<p>
Subscription and posting to the list are free, and position
announcements as well as resumes are sent out once a week (usually each
Friday).
<p>
<hr><b>
<p><font size=+1>
Who is on the list?<p>
</b>
</font>
Naturally, most people on the list are located in the United States, followed
by subcribers from Europe. Nevertheless there are a few hundred people
who joined the list from Asian and South American countries.
<p>
Most people apparently are either students close to graduating or receiving
their Masters or Doctorates and are now trying to use this media to increase
their chances of finding a well-paying job in the environmental field; or they
are persons
who have already worked in an area for some time and are now trying to either
find a new job or to improve their current position by moving up the career 
ladder.<p>

It may be interesting to mention that despite the fact that the majority seems
to be looking for jobs, the number of job announcements being posted to the
list by far exceeds the number of resumes sent to us.<p>
<p>
<hr><b><font size=+1>
<p>

What is being posted?<p>
</b></font>
<p>
Job vacancies being posted are from a variety of different fields in the
environmental job sector.<p>
<p>
One has to distinguish between jobs in the public or academic area and
announcements for vacancies in the private sector. Where offers in the academic
or public area seem to be very widespread in terms of required experience (like
<i>about-to-graduate</i>, <i>doctorate</i> etc.), announcements from private 
companies
mainly regard jobs for senior executives. One cannot generally determine the
proportion of private sector jobs being offered, but a good estimate would
probably be - from reading the announcements - 15 to 25%. The main part is
being made up by academic and public sector vacancies that tends to cover a
bigger percentage of people looking for jobs in the environmental area.<p>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<b><i>
Academic and public sector announcements<p>
</b></i>
<p>
The most predominant jobs being offered are those for ecologists. Job vacancies
range from internships over postdoctoral positions to research associates
and fellowships as well as assistant professorships. There does not seem to be
an area of ecology specifically sought for, instead I have seen announcements
for many kinds of branches of ecology, like
forest ecology,
 wildlife ecology
and insect ecology, to only name a few.<p>
<p>
Besides ecology announcements, biology positions are quite frequent. The jobs
being offered are, in general, similar ones as for ecologists, although the
main area seems to cover research associate positions, whereas internships and
assistant professorships are posted less frequently.<p>
<p>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/engineer.jpg" WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=1
ALT="Engineers">
Ecologist and biologist positions make up for about half of the public and
academic field, the other half is more or less equally spread between GIS
specialists, environmental engineering, and environmental studies and policy.
Least often I receive announcements for environmental chemistry, botany,
environmental health and similar areas.<p>
<p>
Concerning the location of the jobs being offered, it is only natural
that the big majority are in the United States,
although there are also vacancies in other countries, like one-year-internships 
in South America, Asia etc.<p>
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><b><i>
Private sector announcements<p>
</b>
</i>
As opposed to the academic and public sector vacancies, private sector job offers
mainly
tend to address people with several years of experience, looking for senior
executive positions.<p>
<p>
Jobs being offered include program coordinators for individual departments
of big companies as well as executive directors for enterprises operating in
the environmental field. <p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>
Remarks
</font></b>
<p>
Please note that this short article is just an overview of the various kinds
of announcements being sent to the envjobs-l list and 
what I can deduct from these announcements.
The present situation seems to be that
there are quite a few ecologist and biologist positions available, but 
 depending
on the market structure, especially in the United States, this situation may
change very quickly during the next few months. 
<p>
If there is demand, I can offer
a more comprehensive view with more statistical data on the jobs being offered
through our list.<p>

<P>
Every day Austinites flush nearly 70,000,000 gallons of drinking water down the
toilet.  But eliminating human waste doesn't necessarily need to waste so much
water nor endanger groundwater with the occasional leaking pipe.  Recent
innovations have improved the process of decomposing and dispersing effluent
on-site, or within the property line.  To the degree that these new on-site
alternatives are supported and implemented, they may help improve Austin's water
quantity and quality.<P>

Most Austin residents currently depend on a complex web of gravity fed sewerlines
to carry effluent to three treatment plants.  These plants run the wastewater
though an extensive series of decomposition and purification stages before
returning it to the Colorado River five miles downstream.  A number of private
developments operate smaller scale treatment plants but dispose of their effluent
into localized water bodies (three empty into Lake Travis) or over fields, golf
courses, etc.  Besides high water use, arguments against centralized sewers list
the environmental disruption and vulnerability of sewer lines.  Centralized
systems, however, are relatively cheap and publically maintained.<P>

Departing from these centralized systems are a whole class of on-site systems. 
By far the most common of these is the septic tank which collects solids while
passing the majority of the waste into the nearby soil.  Septic tanks work well
enough where soil porosity and organic bacteria are sufficient to disperse and
decompose the effluent's pollutants.  However, within the thin, rocky soils of
the Hill Country, the wholesale implementation of conventional septic systems is
a questionable practice.  "The thin, caliche-type soils in the Edwards Aquifer
region are generally low in organic matter." says Susan Parten of Community
Environmental Services, Inc.  "This can pose a problem over a subsurface of
fractured or Karstic limestone because adequate treatment might not be achieved
before the effluent reaches underlying aquifers or nearby streams."<P>

Septic problems have drawn increased attention to a variety of on-site systems
which begin sewage treatment in the initial collection tank.  For example, the
"aerobic" class of on-site systems introduces oxygen into the tank to begin the
decomposition process.  Determining the appropriateness of an on-site system is
dependent on a complex series of factors including soil depth, bacterial
richness, slope, vegetation and development density.<P>

With so many variables, understanding on-site systems may appear the domain of
white-coated scientists but Michael Kelly, of Clearwater Systems pooh poohs the
notion: "Our systems work with basic parts and principals, " says Kelly,  "Rather
than a true alternative, our tanks are more like a mini wastewater treatment
plant.  Human waste is already loaded with all the bacteria needed to break
itself down. The only thing we have to add is oxygen," Kelly said, "lots of it."<P>

Kelly's aerobic systems pump compressed air bubbles through the effluent before
it moves to two adjacent tanks for disinfectant and storage.  Dispersing the
treated effluent then becomes the task of creative engineering.  Lucia Athens, of
Earth Sky Designs, is a landscape architect working on new ways to use effluent
through a combination of soil absorption, evaporation and plant transpiration.
"One of the designs I'm currently working on directs wastewater toward a small
orchard and some shade vines that we've incorporated into the landscape.  An
added a rain water collection tank helps drive the system, offering the owner
increased independence and efficiency," says Athens.<P>

The sustainability of recycled wastewater make on-site sewage an attractive
option for a variety of green builders, but these systems have their own
challenges. The question of who owns and services on-site systems has yet to be
resolved and a minor maintenance schedule (changing filters and/or adding
occasional activants), must be adopted by the user.  On-site systems also cost
more and complicate the task of assessing the re-sale value of the home.<P>

These costs are part of the growing price tag of water quality.  The City's
Environmental and Conservation Services Department (ECSD) is currently reviewing
a range of on-site systems appropriate for residential use over the Edwards
Aquifer.  ECSD has also commissioned a study by the local engineering firm Loomis
& Associates to obtain more comprehensive data on all potential sources of
pollution in the watershed.  The City hopes to determine what degree of pollution
now appearing in the aquifer stems from septic systems as compared to private
treatment plants or urban and ranchland stormwater runoff.  This effort is
intended to allow the most appropriate, cost-effective controls to be retrofit
into the problem areas.<P>

Septic systems and other on-site waste disposal techniques have long been
suspected of  water quality problems because local regulation emerged only as
late as 1972.  Much development in the Barton Springs Contributing Zone,
especially along Highway 290, occurred before this period.  In 1983, Travis
County began requiring inspections and proper designs of systems.  To what extent
effluent can be successfully regulated remains to be seen, but the number of
variables to be considered promises to keep the human factor in that most basic
of human questions.<P>

Good bathroom reading on various alternatives, including compost toilets and
graywater alternatives, can be found in the book <B>Goodbye To The Flush Toilet</B>,

City of Austin's Innovative Wastwater Treatment Byproduct</FONT><P>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>

<P>
Creative alchemy: turning something worthless into something valuable. That's
what 
the City of Austin is doing with wastewater sludge. Scientifically known as
biosolids, 
euphemistically called "black gold," Austin calls their nutrient-rich byproduct
"Dillo 
Dirt &reg; ."<P>

Austin's Water and Wastewater Utility operates one of the most advanced
beneficial biosolids reuse facilities in the country.  Since its inception in
1987, the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Facility has become a nationally
acclaimed, EPA award-winning biosolids recycling facility, receiving more than 18
local, state and national awards for environmental excellence.<P>

Biosolids are a by-product of specially treated, stabilized and disinfected
wastewater that originated from household and pretreated industrial sources.<P>

The City of Austin reclaims this nutrient-rich organic material from millions of
gallons of wastewater it treats every day.  All biosolids produced are being
recycled through land application or composting.  This compares with a recycling
rate of less than 20% for household solid waste (garbage).  Biosolids are used
for everything from revegetating city landfills and soccer fields. The composting
humus is also sold to the public for improving residential lawns, flower gardens
and fruit orchards.<P>

Here's how the step-by-step process works:

<OL>
<LI>Biosolids Thickening Facility;<BR>
Each day, over 47 dry tons of primary and secondary waste-activated biosolids
arrive via an underground pipeline from the City's three wastewater treatment
plants.  A gravity thickening process separates water from biosolids in the
wastewater residuals to reduce volume and allow the biosolids more time to break
down in the digesters.<P>

<LI>Anaerobic Digestion;<BR>
Thickened biosolids are stabilized through a process called anaerobic (without
oxygen) digestion to reduce odors and pathogen levels inside eight 2 million
gallon tanks or digestors. Methane gas, a by-product of the process, is used to
power on-site electric generators and heat the digesters.<P>

<LI>Drying Basins;<BR>
Digested biosolids are pumped into 25 acres of concrete drying basins.  The
biosolids are turned and air dried with special equipment.<P>

<LI>Compost Program;<BR>
Over 50% of the dried biosolids are processed into a stable organic product
called Dillo Dirt. &reg; Treated biosolids are combined with bulking agents such
as
tree trimmings, yard waste and recycled Christmas trees and then formed into 6
foot high windrows.   Approximately 70,000 cubic yards of these bulking agents
from the City's "Don't Bag It" and "Curbside Recycling" programs are diverted
from local landfills annually, saving valuable space and greatly reducing the
cost of solid waste disposal for Austin residents.<P>

<LI>Land Application;<BR>
Approximately 45% of the dried biosolids are applied to a 300-acre on-site farm. 
Nutrients from the biosolids improve the production of feed corn, hay, pecans and
other crops.  A contract farmer harvests the crops and returns a portion of the
sales revenue to the City.  The program, regulated by the Texas Natural Resources
Conservation Commission, is currently being expanded to improve soil conditions
and revegetate the municipal landfill and other off-site agricultural locations. 
Process water and storm water from the site is also cleaned by a series of ponds
and an aquatic greenhouse before it is used to irrigate onsite farmland.

<FONT SIZE=+2>The Basics</FONT><P>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>

<P>
It's not rocket science by any means. Treating millions of gallons of wastewater
a day, the City of Austin utilizes basic chemistry concepts.<P>

The processes and apparatus are simple: Screens to filter the big debris; settling
tanks for liquid/solid dissipation; mechanical aeration to supply oxygen to
aerobic bacteria that eats up the waste; chemical additives for disinfection. But
to treat the sheer volume requires sophisticated monitoring and reliable systems.<P>

The City of Austin's Walnut Creek treatment facility serves approximately 300,000
customers and has a processing capacity of 60 million gallons per day.<P>

An 11 mile cross-town interceptor, up to 96 inches in diameter, transports
wastewater to the facility by gravity alone.<P>


A central computer console monitors 2700 individual points throughout the plant,
relaying information to the operators and allowing equipment to be controlled
remotely.<P>

Sludge from the system is transported to the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Treatment
Facility (see <A HREF="dillo.html">Dillo Dirt</A> story). Some of the reclaimed water is used by the city
to water parkways and greenbelts, the rest is discharged into Walnut Creek, a
tributary to the Colorado River.<P>

The city uses a three-stage treatment system.<P>

<H3>The Treatment Process</H3>

<H4>Primary Treatment</H4>

Wastewater enters the plant at the headworks and flows through screens which
remove large objects such as sticks, trash, and paper. After screening the
wastewater flows into grit basins in which heavier inorganic materials, such as
sand, small stones and trash, are settled out and transferred to dump truck along
with the screenings. These are disposed of at the landfill.<P>

The flow is then measured in a special flume and continues to flow by gravity
into the primary clarifiers. Here a large portion of the remaining organic and
inorganic matter is settled to the bottom of the clarifier and pumped to the
sludge processing facility at Hornsby Bend. The wastewater is then received by
the flow equalization basins. This is not a treatment process but allows storage
of high flows so that a constant rate may be applied to the biological part of
the process.<P>

The primary treatment portion of the plant is totally enclosed of ordorous gases.<P>

<H4>Secondary Treatment</H4>

Wastewater is now pumped into the aeration basins where the activated sludge,
which is essentially a large mass of microorganisms, consumes the remaining
dissolved organic matter.<P>

In the secondary clarifiers, the bacteria and absorbed material settle out to be
recycled to the aeration basins. As the mass of microorganisms grow, a portion is
removed and pumped to the sludge handling facility.<P>

The wastewater now purged of at least 95% of the wastes, passes to the chlorine
basins where only enough chlorine is applied to disinfect it.<P>

<H4>Tertiary Treatment</H4>

To further reduce suspended solids, the wastewater flows through dual medial
filters, much like a drinking water treatment process. Then sulfur dioxide is
applied in a small dose to dechlorinate before discharging the effluent into
Walnut Creek.

<H2>A Brief Overview</H2>
<P>
By Leonard Lied
</CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Microbes R R Friends&quot;, to paraphrase a popular TV commercial.
A microbe or microorganism is any microscopic life form. Actually
microbes are all around us, even inside us. Without this basic
life form human life could not exist. Potentially harmful microbes
are called pathogens, but there are <U>billions</U> of microbes
that are helpful. From the simplest septic tank, which some of
you have in your yard, to the largest city sewer plant, microbes
are at work cleaning the water. They convert wastes to elements
that provide nourishment for plants which in turn produce food
for animals including humans. This is the concept of ecology,
recycling our waste and leaving the fewest possible destructive
materials behind.
<P>
Almost any waste that is produced ends up in our water. Dealing
with it is what the science of wastewater treatment is all about.
The decision for specific treatment methods employed is based
on how much waste has to be handled, the types of waste, and how
much land is available. Population, economics, climate, and where
the discharge can be routed are all part of the equation. The
discharge from treatment facilities eventually must either be
returned to the land or a body of water. Let's review a little
history.
<P>
With the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid 1800's
factories sprang up. People moved to the cities to get jobs and
have a better life. Most population centers were located near
the oceans, lakes, or rivers. The waste from the heavy concentration
of people, plus that of the factories, was being dumped into these
waterways. Everything in the water began to die. In the early
1900's pioneers of ecology initiated the concept of treating the
water before discharging it into the natural water systems. It
was not until 1972, with the passage of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments, that real control of the discharge of
wastewater began.
<P>
The oldest and perhaps best way to treat wastewater is in an oxidation
pond which is basically an area that will hold wastewater. Where
land usage permits this practice is still used today. After putting
wastewater into the pond three layers are naturally formed. Sedimentation
occurs first when the heaviest part of the waste, the solids,
fall to the bottom The middle layer is made up of dissolved solids,
a mixture of water and waste that is soluble in water. The top
layer is primarily water. Microbes already present in the waste
increase rapidly once this separation process has occurred. The
microbes most commonly employed in biological wastewater treatment
are separated into the following classes: bacteria, fungi, protozoa,
rotifers, and algae.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="images/pond1.gif" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=206 ALT="OXIDATION-POND">
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Aerobic</B> microbes need oxygen to survive. Fungi, Protozoa,
Rotifers, and algae all live in the aerobic (oxygen rich) layer
at and close to the surface of the pond. We depend on microbes
in this layer to consume the pathogens.
<P>
<B>Facultative</B> microbes can exist either in the presence or
the absence of oxygen. The facultative layer is a transitional
stage where some of the most complex processes occur. Many different
theories exist but the constant changes in the microbes themselves
present a real challenge in complete understanding.
<P>
<B>Anaerobic</B> microbes, primarily bacteria, many of them pathogenic,
live in an environment without oxygen. Anaerobes can decompose
many different types of organic and inorganic wastes. At the bottom
of the pond in the sediment or sludge you would expect to find
anaerobic (little or no oxygen) conditions
<P>
In each of these layers, or environments, different processes
of decomposition, metabolization, and digestion take place. Each
of the specific microbe types is doing its job of removal or conversion
of the wastes and provides food for other of the microbes in the

pond. Without sufficient oxygen in the surface layer or with the
addition of too much waste, the pond quickly becomes anaerobic.
The anaerobes produce noxious gases as part of the decomposition
process they perform. Many of these bacteria can also be harmful
to humans. It is in the aerobic layer where these gases and most
of the bacteria are consumed by the aerobic microbes. If the aerobic
layer is sufficiently healthy there are no odor problems and a
much more complete removal of waste and harmful bacteria is accomplished.
<P>
Getting enough oxygen into the water for this process to continue
has always been a challenge and is often <B>the</B> critical factor.
Wind and wave action add oxygen from the atmosphere. Some algae
contribute oxygen as part of their life cycle. Mechanical aeration,
pumping air into the upper layer of the pond, is the most commonly
used method. As the amount of air pumped into the water increases
so does the agitation. This disturbs the natural layers already
mentioned and causes some disruption of microbial processes at
work. Natural Oxygen Products produces AG 14, a mixture of aerobic
and facultative microbes that add large amounts of oxygen to the
water without the disturbance caused by aeration. In this way
a much more efficient and complete conversion of waste occurs.
The greater the level of oxygen the more effective the process.
<P>
Some algae types produce oxygen through photosynthesis taking
energy from the sun and nutrients and carbon dioxide from the
water. However rampant algae growth, called an algae bloom, can
completely cover a pond depriving it of atmospheric oxygen and
sunlight. When algae dies it consumes large amounts of oxygen
as it decomposes, often killing the aerobic layer. On a microbial
level AG 14 reacts with dying algae and other suspended solids
causing them to fall back into the anaerobic layer at the bottom,
where they provide additional food for anaerobic bacteria. This
process clears the aerobic layer allowing ultra violet light from
the sun to penetrate and assist in the destruction of pathogens.
<P>
The following pictures illustrate how AG-14 affected suspended
solids in an industrial oxidation pond.

<P>
All biological wastewater treatment facilities use some version
of the principles employed in the basic oxidation pond. Variables
such as pH levels, chemicals (both in the waste and added by operators)
ambient temperature, retention time, and nutrients in the waste
have a dramatic influence on the microbial life which must be
sustained. A treatment facility operator processing 20 million
gallons per day faces countless problems trying to keep all of
these variables in balance.
<P>
Microbes acclimate to their environment rapidly. Most bacteria
reproduce by division. This cycle can be as short as 20 minutes
or as long as several days. Each succeeding generation evolves
toward better utilization of the food sources available. As man
produces more complex compounds microbial science becomes increasingly
important. Microbiologists continually research, modify and develop,
task specific microbes to address the breakdown of elements in
our wastewater. Mr. Al Gough, the founder of Natural Oxygen Products,
patent holder, and early environmentalist, has worked for more
than thirty years to isolate and produce microbes that have applications
in wastewater and air treatment, agriculture and aquaculture,
and veterinary and medical areas. The national trend has long
been toward large scale high-tech, high-cost solutions to many
of our problems. Only recently has there been a reexamination
of the simpler more direct natural approach.

&nbsp;<BR>
When I was in my first few weeks of graduate school in Chemical Engineering, I
went to the various advisors and chatted with them about the projects they might
want me to work on.  At the time, I had very little preference for one field or
another.  However, I found one project very interesting.  It was very interesting
because the research was in the environmental field, and I thought it might be
neat to do research that made me feel like I was doing something, well, good.<P>

I was right.<P>

So I spent six years in graduate school working on this project.  It's pretty
cool.  What I've been developing is a method to remove chlorinated solvents from
ground waters.  Chlorinated solvents means chemicals that are typically used by
dry cleaners and machine shops as degreasers, which were found to be carcinogens
during the seventies and have since declined in popularity, a lot like disco. 
Ground waters means well water.  Half, or slightly more, of the U. S.  population
gets their drinking water from ground waters, and the most frequently found
priority pollutants are (ding!) chlorinated solvents.<P>

The best current way to remove these bad things is to pass the water through
activated carbon (you know those Brita clean water pitcher thingmabobs? 
Activated carbon.)  Activated carbon acts like a sponge.  Unfortunately, it has
similar properties - it can only take up so much stuff before it starts leaking,
and if you just let it set, it starts to drool like a St. Bernard.  So you take
your used carbon and throw it away.  It goes to a landfill, where the carbon
'drools' the pollutant right back into the ground and the groundwater.<P>

Now usually this isn't such a big deal, because the bacteria in the soil like to
eat up most drool.  Unfortunately, most of these chlorinated solvents aren't
eaten by anything.  That's because of the property that made them popular in the
first place - they don't burn.  Therefore bacteria can't get anything out of
burning them as food.  So these compounds hang around, and get back in the water,
and what have you accomplished but to move the problem to someone else's back
yard?<P>

As it happens, some bacteria are stupid, and are able to degrade these compounds.
 They don't get any benefit at all from doing it, but that's not our problem. 
Our problem is to get these bacteria to degrade lots of this stuff.  Well, that's
my problem.  Actually, that was the goal of my research - to use some of these
bacteria and develop a treatment system.  I've learned alot, and I think it is
possible that a real system will come out of this research, but I've more defined
what doesn't work (which has something to do with the six years, but I will admit
that Doom and Marathon had something to do with it too.)<P>

I do know that when the process works well, it costs about what the activated
carbon does, and it destroys the chemicals - turns them into chloride and carbon
dioxide and cell mass.  My advisors, Gerald Speitel Jr. and George Georgiou, are
continuing to pursue the work.<P>

As far as me, I think I'll look into using these bacteria underground (they
already exist most everywhere, it's just a question of getting them to prosper),
and look at genetically engineered bacteria for the same purpose.  I know a lot
of people are scared of genetic engineering, but having worked with genetic
engineers (you oughta see their train sets), I now know that what they are doing
is to use natural methods of moving bits of DNA around.  Sure, I'm scared of AIDS
and Ebola and multiple antibiotic resistant diseases.  Oh yeah, those were gifts
of nature, not genetic engineering.  But still, I do feel that genetically
engineered microorganisms (GEMs) will be widely accepted for many applications in
the near future (ten years?).<P>

Recently, during my interview with the department chairman of Civil Engineering
at the University of Missouri at Rolla (I've accepted the position, and will be
teaching environmental engineering), he asked why I wanted to be a professor.  My
response, the first thing that came to my mind, was to say that I wanted the
position because at the end of the day, I could feel like I had accomplished
something good - not merely that I had pushed forward the bounds of science on
any given day, or had educated someone, but because I would have the satisfaction
to have helped humankind.<P>

I can't say that I came to the environmental field from any burning desire to
protect nature or man, but now that I'm here, it feels pretty good.<P>

</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>

What's dripping down your drain may come back to you again.<P>

While sinks and toilets are convenient waste receptacles, there are many common
household products that should never be flushed down a drain.<P>

Just one gallon of motor oil can contaminate up to 2 million gallons of drinking
water. Many household cleaners can also harm the environment, especially water
supplies.<P>

High phosphate levels can kill a river and all the life within it. Many
supermarket-variety laundry detergents contain phosphates. The average consumer
nationwide uses about 30 pounds of laundry detergent a year; all together,
Americans use about 8.3 billion pounds of dry detergents and a billion gallons of
liquid detergents each year! Some cities, including Austin, Texas, have banned
the sale of phosphate detergents, but many other communities have not.<P>

Many other household cleaning products contain harmful solvents and harsh
chemicals that destroy the natural processes involved in wastewater treatment
(see story on <A HREF="micro.html">microbes</A>).  It's not hard to tell which
are the most harmful - does the product cause your eyes to sting or water? do you
wince from the smack of the strong chemical odor? does it burn when it contacts
your skin? We are literally killing ourselves with cleanliness.<P>

Neither prescription nor over-the-counter medicines should ever be disposed of
down a drain. They also can kill the good bacterial microbes.<P>

Paints and even paint brushes shouldn't be cleaned in a sink. Along with harmful
solvents and resins, paints contain many additives including biocides,
fungicides, antifreeze, antisettling agents, fillers, catalysts, curing agents,
driers, emulsifiers, fire retardants, plasticizers and thickeners!<P>

Think before you pour waste down the sink. Only natural, food and human wastes
should be disposed in our sewer systems.<P>

Buy non-phosphate detergents. Use a trusty plunger and boiling water to unclog a
drain. Try earth-friendly cleaning products - they're less caustic and clean just
the same. Dispose of left-over paints and used motor oil through city or county
recycling/recollection programs.<P>

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
In Texas, the combined municipal and industrial discharge of wastewater - about 21 
billion gallons per day - is enough to fill Texas Stadium (home of the Superbowl XXX 
Champion Dallas Cowboys) 27 times over with wastewater.
<P>
 
 <IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
20,477 million gallons of wastewater are discharged into Texas river basins daily.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Wastewater flows from domestic sources average about 100 gallons per day for each 
person served.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
In a city of one million residents, about 200,000 lbs. of suspended solids are turned 
into sludge at the city's domestic wastewater plant each day.

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Fecal coliform is the major cause of impairment in Texas streams and rivers.
<P>


<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
The Rio Grande, the river which forms part of the border between Texas and Mexico, 
serves as both the major source of drinking water and the principle recipient of 
wastewater for the region.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=16 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Together, the Mexican border cities of Ciudad Juarez, Ojinaga, Ciudad Acuna, Piedras 
Negras, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros discharge an estimated 175 million gallons 
of wastewater into the Rio Grande and Gulf of Mexico per day. About 112 million gallons 
per day is untreated, the remaining 63 million gallons receive only primary treatment.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Since 1972, the amount of pollution dischaged in wastewater by domestic facilities 
has decreased about 70% in Texas. At the same time the amount of wastewater 
requiring treatment has increased by 85%.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Different organic materials in wastewaters require different amounts of oxygen - commonly 
known as Biochemical Exygen Demand (BOD) - in order to break down and stablize the 
material. The greater the BOD, the greater the oxygen depleting effect of the wasterwater 
upon the receiving stream. The BOD of typical untreated domestic wastewater varies from 
100 to 300 milligrams per liter. Chicken blood from a food processing plant, on the other 
hand, might require from 1,000 to 4,000 milligrams per liter of BOD to treat.
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=14 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
One of the best sources of information for the amount of toxics entering Texas waters is 
the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Under the federal Superfund Authorization and Renewal 
Act, manufactuing companies with 10 or more employees that use or manufacture more than 
25,000 lbs. per year of any of more than 320 toxic chemicals or compounds must file an 
annual report with the state.

<FONT SIZE=+1>by <B>Pamela Colloff</B></CENTER><BR>
<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just outside the Austin city limits, where paved subdivisions
and traffic snarls give way to the Hill Country, lies Patricia DuBose Michael's
permaculture retreat. As a &reg; Permaculture instructor and bioregionalist, she wants
to make people fiercely love the place they live, to be as she puts it;
"territitorial."

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/patricia.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Patricia" WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=211>



We should have roots in our bioregion, in our place, and feel like we belong,"
she says. If you have roots in the land and you find value there, you'll be a
better territorialist than anybody else. That tree in the parking lot that is
still alive that people have been paving around for years: there's a lesson
there."

<P>


Patricia sits on the sun-lit deck that overlooks the retreat's seven acres of
cedar-lined limestone.  The terrain is crisscrossed with swales: tiny man-made
dams that slow the flow of rainwater to prevent flooding and maximize rainfall. 
When she and her husband first purchased the retreat, they build these swales by
cutting the low branches from the land's juniper trees, trimming and bundling
them, and then positioning them along the land's inclines. 

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/swale.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Swale" WIDTH=272 HEIGHT=200>
Swales, she explains,
are "a way of managing water for long-term feeding of plants by creating little
regional aquifers. The water will hang there for a period of time. If there's a
large rainfall, water will slow down. It's like an irrigation system....You could
build them out of trash -- well, so called "trash" -- or blocks, or sticks, or
soil. Anybody can do it; you don't have to have any money." 

<P>

When she and her
husband bought the land, it "was a dense monoculture of nothing but juniper and
oak that we had to crawl through." Patricia and her husband did selective
harvesting, contoured the land, put in swales and larger retention ponds, and
planted around 5000 shrubs and fruit trees. 

<P>

"It's richer in any bioregion to
leave what you can of what's already on the ground and then integrate what you
want, rather than taking out and replacing," she explains. Swales can help to
maximize what is already growing in a bioregion. "A lot of times we already have
our crop, but we chop down our crop to try to grow something that's just puny in
that area. So we have to know enough about the native plants to know what is crop
and where we can get our living." 

<P>

This is one of the basic ideas behind
Patricia's permaculture classes. She instructs people on how to optimize their
bioregions and thereby become less dependent on manufactured drugs and processed
food, and learn what they might find in their own bioregion. In addition,
Patricia teaches her students guerrilla media, bioregional organizing techniques,
and personal and public health.

<P> 

"You're a bioregionalist if you think it's better
to cooperate around biological systems and to know and be bonded with the place
that you live," Patricia explains. "But &reg; Permaculture is a trademark, a
copyrighted word, and to use it, you have to be trained in a 72-hour
certification course. Anyone who's taken the course can instruct." 

<P>

Each course
teaches the basic tenets of permaculture as well as bioregional strategies that
are relevant to the issues of the participants' particular area. Patricia's
course in Baytown, for example, taught women union stewards from the Exxon plant
about personal health in relation to toxins and air quality, while the course in
West Texas that took place around a campfire taught about broad-scale grazing and
water infiltration. An inner-city course at a community center focused on
resources, the community, and traditional folk medicine. Other courses in urban
settings have even had a section on effective dumpster diving. 

<P>

"I try to teach
people what they need," she says. "I teach to any population that's interested,
and I work on training other teachers." 

<P>

Patricia's upbringing has a great deal to
do with her understanding of self-sustenance. She was raised by her grandmother,
who worked as a midwife around the Santa Fe railway yard near Wichita, Kansas.
"My grandmother practiced from a long tradition of women which she passed on to
me and our family, women who lived off the land and grew their food and medicines
and knew how to serve their populations." 

<P>

Outside of Wichita, Patricia explains,
"there was a mixture of poor people and new immigrants from all over the world,
so I got to sit at dinner tables with Chinese and Mexican traditional medicine
people, folk medicine people from Japan and the Balkans. I got a peek, through
childhood, of this very rich way that people have always lived having what they
needed around them, supporting them, including their communities." 

<P>

Patricia
stresses that people's connections to their surroundings have changed greatly
since her grandmother's time. "If you look in any cookbook from before the turn
of the century, there are recipes for medicines and how to make things for the
house," she says. "But if you look in a cookbook now, they require you to buy a
package of pre-mixed ingredients. You put three or four of those packets together
to make a 'recipe.' Not only does it make us dependent, it increases our
non-commitment." Patricia is deeply concerned with this rift between people and
their surroundings, noting that "now even the wildest gang member is quite often
afraid of nature. I knew a teenager once who actually freaked out when some weeds
and plants touched his leg because he'd never been around anything but paved
surfaces." 

<P>

Although she has previously taught in the university system as an
architecture professor, Patricia has grown wary of academia's impractical and
uninspiring lessons and teaching methods. "If whatever students are studying
isn't teaching them directly how to live on the ground and how to handle the
products of their own body -- their own waste water, their own possessions -- and
if it doesn't teach them really practical information about how to take care of
themselves or others, then they should get out of it. 

<P>

"Parenting isn't even
taught in the universities; that's the most important skill we've got going.
That's survival," she says emphatically. "Food and growing food is not taught.
Most university campuses are waste lands. I only know of only two universities
that grow food or that address the idea of edible landscaping in some
departments. I don't know of any universities that teach life skills...There
might be hope if universities taught these things, but very few of them teach
it." 

<P>

She adds, "We don't just need information, we need hope, and that's what the
universities aren't giving. If you get someone excited about taking action, but
they don't have the materials to work with, that can only breed greater
hopelessness." 

<P>

Getting territorial doesn't mean drawing a line in the sand.
"Anything that creates barriers is not in keeping with the laws of nature,
because nature doesn't have barriers, separations. Nature doesn't have hard
edges; it flows from one place to the other, and that's a healthy system. It's
like water. The minute you stop water, it becomes unhealthy water. If water's
flowing, it's healthy water, alive water. It's the same with us." Indeed,
Patricia shows how there is nothing less stagnant than a deep, long-term
committment to our land.

<IMG SRC="images/coffee.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Hot Tea" WIDTH=92 HEIGHT=100>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Looking intently into the warm, rippling water of his cup as he
stirs his morning tea, Hal Strickland is talking about swales, and soil and
symbiosis.

<P>

I'd met Hal just two nights before in the campfire light of a backyard potluck
dinner attended by an eclectic assortment of Austinites: community organizers,
environmentalists, artisans and muscians, journalists, small business owners, and
assorted bohemians. Asking to meet someone involved in bioregionalism, several
fingers point me in Hal's direction.

<P>

Now we're having breakfast at Magnolia Cafe and Hal is obviously warming into one
of his favorite subjects.

<P>

"A swale is a constructed slope to detain water. It can be little more than one
inch high, laid in contour with the land," Hal begins. "We have to stop rainwater
in its tracks. What arrives from the sky is the most abundant and the cleanest
water versus the water that travels miles to you, that's been treated,
chlorinated or pumped to you."

<P>

"In Austin, with an annual 33-35" of rainfall, the idea of a drought is testament
to our lack of awareness," Hal continues, pointing out that the area's abundant
rivers, creeks and springs are drying up due to the overuse of groundwater in the
Edwards Aquifer.

<P>

"Look at California with its much more restricted rain patterns. The miracle of
California agriculture is massive irrigation. It's destroyed many California
waterways. The Colorado used to support a delta and abundant life. Even the Sea
of Cortez has suffered."

<P>

Hal recounts visiting the little Mexican communities within the dead delta zone,
now a desert, where occasional floods can wipe out an entire village.

<P>

"You have to start with a plan," he says. "Utilize available rainfall by
constructing a land form, even on a microscale, such as a swale. If we could
cause our generous rainfall to percolate, our streams would flow year-round."

<P>

Hal steeps his tea with another cup of hot water as he begins describing his own
epiphany into permaculture, which he says teaches how to "take any piece of land
on the earth and consider it as human habitation while respecting the other life
living there."

<P>

Hal's own watershed event occurred in 1988 when he attended a two-week training
seminar with the permaculture pioneer, Australian Bill Mollison. "In two weeks I
was exposed to what I always wanted to learn in college. All these different
disciplines had not been knitted together before."

<P>

Understanding the complexities and interdependencies within natural systems and
agricultural techniques is the foundation of permaculture. The swales that save
rainwater also save soil. "Rain is driven by gravity. Washouts, runoffs carry
large amounts of sediment away. The bigger the runoff event the bigger the
damage."

<P>

"Take contour plowing," Hal continues, "the old-timers know it works but modern
growers are cutting down windbreaks that protect their fields from erosion."
Rather than reading the slope of the land and plowing to maximize its benefits
for soil protection and rain collection and direction, most fields are flattened
and plowed in straight rows.

<P>

"Modern farming is designed to maximize the consumption of industrial byproducts
like pesticides and fertilizers." While these techniques produce large harvests
and sustain agri-industries, "this big time agri-business burns off the microbial
life of the soil," Hal points out.

<P>

"But permaculture relies on the symbiotic relations within nature; cultivating
these complexities and relationships, " he says. "In permaculture you think 'how
many uses can this plant demonstrate?'"

<P>

"The sycamore tree that drops leaves is building the soil. If placed properly it
shades a house in the summer and lets in sun in the winter. It brings birds that
eat pests. It has a guild relationship with other tree species that grow best
when they grow together."

<P>

"In diversity, in this richness, there is more sustainability. In complex units
there is more opportunity for success than in singular-focused systems," Hal
notes from his own experience farming for 15 years in the Texas Hill Country.

<P>

Hal speaks admiringly of the Soil Conservation Service which in the 1930s taught
similar techniques to dust-bowl farmers. But this knowledge has been lost or
forgotten. Permaculture is reapplying such old-time knowledge in these newer
times when sustainability has never been more important.

<P>

"Did you know that when our highland lake dams (the damming of the Colorado River
in the Central Texas region) were constructed, 320 earthen dams were also
created?" Hal asks. "These systems of swales are now abandoned. But it was
intelligent, very intelligent."

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Sustainable Food: Buying & Growing Locally</FONT><P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1>by Pamela Colloff</FONT><P>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Why should you think locally, not globally the next time you're
hungry? Greta Hunter Watson, the Program Coordinator for Austin's Sustainable
Food Center, sees several distinct advantages to buying within your own
bioregion; not only does it keep food dollars in the local economy, but food is
fresher, cheaper, and healthier. 

<P>

"The fresher your food is," she explains, "the more vitamin content it has, the
better it tastes, the better it cooks, the less it deteriorates, and the less
you're apt to have to use pesticides or fungicides when you're shipping or
storing it."

<P>

By drastically limiting the distance that food has to travel and time it must be
stored, there is no need for farmers to add unhealthy additives that are passed
on to consumers. Fruits and vegetables that are shipped from other parts of the
country such as apples, bell peppers, cucumbers and eggplants are not only
frequently sprayed with pesticides, but are coated in canuba wax. This wax locks
in pesticides, making it difficult to wash off food thoroughly. 

<P>

Because of preservatives and wax, produce that looks fresh may actually be quite
old. "Many of the apples you see in the store from Washington are over a year old
-- they've been in cold storage," says Greta. By minimizing the distance that food
is shipped, farmers can offer their produce at cheaper prices by cutting down on
transportation costs, pesticides, and the amount of food damaged in transit. 

<P>

"We always try to buy organic, local produce first," said Greg Thibeaux, Produce
Buyer and Assistant Manager for the Wheatsville Food Co-op. "We put up signs
telling customers when things are Texas-grown, and they really respond to that."

<P>

In addition to encouraging stores and consumers to support local farmers and
ranchers, the Sustainable Food Center is responsible for turning a vacant lot
into the Eastside Community Farmers' Market. Every Saturday from May to October,
local farmers sell fresh fruit and vegetables to the East Side's economically
disadvantaged community which is frequently unable to obtain fresh produce. The
two East Side grocery stores are not always easily accessible for those who don't
have cars, and their produce is higher priced and less fresh than in other
neighborhoods. 

<P>

Adjacent to the Farmers' Market is the Eastside Community Garden, where two acres
are available to individuals, families, and organizations to organically grow
fruits, vegetables and flowers. The idea for the garden began when the
Sustainable Food Center found that one 4 x 16 foot garden in Austin can provide a
family of four with fresh fruit and vegetables every day of the year and save the
family $600 in grocery bills. Gardeners can also sell any surplus produce at the
farmers' market to increase their family income. 

<P>

In addition to the garden and market, the Cocina Allegre Food School teaches
low-income families how to prepare heathful meals on a shoestring budget. Local
chefs teach free six-week courses in English and Spanish, showing how to be both
nutritional and cook for no more than $1.20 per serving. 

<P>

The idea behind all of these projects, explains Greta, "is to unite rural and
urban groups. That's why with the farmer's market we have rural food for urban
people." The Center is also considering setting up an agriculture apprenticeship
program for East Side teenagers in which they would learn how to farm and live
sustainably.

<P>

"In the last 65 years, Texas has gone from over 80,000 farms owned by black
farmers to 3,000 farms owned by black framers," says Greta. "Farming is going out
of the hands of the ethnic minority. One of the ways to keep ourselves strong is
to encourage ethnic diversity in land management, as well as sustainability and
reducing the use of pesticides."

<P>

One group that is helping to achieve those goals is the Texas Sustainable
Agriculture Working Group, a coalition of more than 900 farmers, ranchers,
environmentalists, consumers, and public policy makers who are dedicated to
increasing public awareness of sustainable agriculture by disseminating
information, finding markets for their products, and encouraging public policy
that supports sustainable methods.

<P>

Another program that is raising public awareness in-state is the Texas Department
of Agriculture's Buy Texas campaign. Local fruits, vegetables, and meats have
stickers announcing that they are "Texas Grown." The 10-year-old program, says
the TDA's Susan Dunn, "Has been a huge success. There are now 750 companies
included." The Buy Texas program also includes the Vintage Texas program for
local wines and the Naturally Texas program for locally made clothes. Both
programs try to raise consumers' awareness of these products and encourage them
to buy locally.

<P>

In addition, in the coming year, the Austin-Travis County Food Policy Council -- a
partnership between the private sector and government -- is working towards making
unused public land available for farms and community gardens as well as assisting
existing small food stores, helping to develop new grocery stores and food
co-ops, and making it easier for people to access supermarkets. 

<P>

The Sustainable Food Center, which helps coordinate the Food Policy Council and
the Texas Sustainable Agriculture Working Group, will also work this year with
local schools to help improve school lunches by encouraging the use of fresh,
local produce. "This will stimulate local agriculture, reduce the amount of
chemicals in our children's food and, because it tastes better, increase the
amount of good food our kids eat," says the Center's publication <I>Food For
Thought</I>. The Center will also try to certify more farmers' markets to accept
food stamps and WIC coupons.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3><CENTER>Of Place and People: Bioregionalism</CENTER></FONT>

<P>
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1>by <STRONG>Marshall Frech</STRONG><BR>
</CENTER>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>
Do you know where your drinking water comes from?  How about your food?  Where do
they go...eventually?  If you can't answer these questions you're like many
people who care for the earth but don't always know where to start that caring. 

<P>

--Enter Bioregionalism, a philosophy or working concept that employs a heightened
awareness of the ecological needs of the naturally-defined area in which you
live.  Or to borrow the artful phrase, it is "a new terrain of consciousness." 
For example: we who are lucky enough to live in the geographic area known as
Austin, Texas, might acknowledge that we live in the Hill Country, the distinct
geographical area marked by the Balcones fault.  This area has its own particular
environmental challenges such as delicate limestone aquifers, endangered species,
etc, plus myriad human factors such as forecasts for significant population
growth.

<P>

Actualizing the bioregional mindset changes the resource game a bit, there's a
different map, and some new ground rules.  The goal is to maintain the most
ecological stability that your community can muster within its local geography. 
Again, this agenda stems from the belief that the instructions on how to survive
in a particular region lie within its locally-attuned culture.

<P>

"After they grasp the basics, many environmentalists begin to think of themselves
as bioregionalists" says Ted Norris a local bioregional practitioner.  "And when
you consider," adds Norris, "that the average calorie in this country now travels
2000 miles before it is eaten, and that the U. S. is becoming more dependent on
other countries for food, a bioregional approach may yield ffers a few dearly
needed solutions."

<P>

In his book, Dwellers on the Land, author Kirkpatrick Sale applauds the
bioregionalist concept as an environmental effort "on a scale at which human
potential can match ecological reality."  This phrase smacks of down-to-earth
pragmatism and sensibility, but since the concept counters the great American
consumer mindset, applied bioregionalism turns out to be somewhat radical in its
implications.

<P>

For starters there are some just crazy, nutso, wacked-out things you can do
around your home like xeriscape your yard with native plants, support local food
growers (and retailers), and even trap rainfall from your roof into an old barrel
to irrigate your shade trees. There are an earthful of other activities to chose
from and people can apply themselves where-ever they see fit: cultural
restoration, neighborhood gardening, education, political activism, etc.

<P>

Perhaps bioregionalism's great asset is that its simple, local, hands-on nature
directs awareness back to the land.  In case you haven't noticed yet, the
environmental movement is getting more amorphous as it grows.  And with the
seduction of media crises drawing public attention away from core concerns, our
high-tech culture is increasingly deficient in regional knowledge.  The American
mind still leans precariously toward a global monoculture with all of its
postmodern conveniences.  We like to play golf in the desert, feast on
well-traveled calories, and entertain delusions of fail-safe developments in
fragile watersheds.

<P>

Bioregionalism isn't perfect, and it is not an all inclusive solution to
environmental problems.  But, there is a world of sustainability that needs
exploration and bioregionalism appears to be a map with a starting point.

<P>

* By the way, most of Austin's food is imported from California.  Our drinking
water comes from the local Colorado River, and our wastewater, after extensive
treatment, returns there.

The defining characteristics of a bioregion (much like an ecosystem) are usually
based on a variety of common physical characteristics including climate, soil,
landforms, microclimates, plant and animal communities, watersheds, and the human
cultures that exist there.

<P>

The scientific community has attempted to specify global bioregions through the
relationship of climate and natural vegetation;  These range from temperate
deciduous forest to temperate grassland, desert, or tropical scrubforest.

<P>

On a more local scale, the highly diverse geography of Texas has had several
different bioregional classifications.  The Natural Heritage Policy Project in
1978, at a meeting in Winedale, Texas, classified Texas into eleven natural
regions and twenty seven subregions.  Another, developed by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in 1979, classifies the State into eight major natural regions
and thirty five subregions.

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/ttexas.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="Texas" WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=36>&nbsp; See
accompanying story on <A HREF="texasbio.html">Bioregions of Texas</A>.

<P>

Bioregional concepts are useful as a planning aid and management tool to help us
more effectively use natural resources and to look at human impacts on the
environment.  Knowledge about bioregions and their components can also help us to
decide what areas are best suited for what purposes.  For example, identifying
areas that are floodplains is a first step for designating building limitations. 
A bioregional view can also help us in deciding what areas to set aside as
natural preserves, parks and other similar designations that will protect natural
ecosystems.

<P>

Increasing our knowledge of the place we live and acting responsibly on that
knowledge is essential to our long term survival as a species.  Viewing the world
in terms of bioregions and ecosystems is a major step on the road to building a
cooperative sustainable relationship with our environment.

<P>

<P>A bioregion classifies an area based primarily on the common characteristics of
climate, soil, landforms, microclimates, plant communities, watersheds, and
native plants and animals.  Several individuals and groups have described various
bioregions that make up the State of Texas.  The following descriptions of Texas
bioregions is based on the bioregional delineations developed by the Natural
Heritage Policy Project at a conference in Winedale, Texas, in 1978.  The result
of this meeting was a description of eleven natural regions and 27 subregions.

<HR><B>Region 1 - Piney Woods</B>

<P>Composed of two subregions, the Longleaf Pine Forest and the Mixed Pine-Oak
Forest, this portion of the state can best be described as gently rolling to
hilly-forested land.  The forested areas give way at times to small, open
grasslands.  The region has an average rainfall of 35 to 50 inches and vegetation
is abundant. Farming, cattle ranching, and lumbering have been major economic
activities and continue to be of considerable importance.  Human population
growth, in particular the northward expansion of Houston, is having major
ecological impacts on the region.  This region occupies the eastern extreme of
the state and covers approximately 23,500 square miles.

<HR><B>Region 2 - Oak Woods and Prairies</B>

<P>Running generally from northeast to southwest, is the 19,500 square mile band of
Oak Woods and Prairies.  Region Two is gently rolling to hilly and receives 35 to
45 inches of rainfall per year.  While the rainfall in the Piney Woods Region is
fairly uniformly distributed throughout the year, the rainfall in Region Two
peaks in May or June.  The Oak Woods and Prairies Region contains three
subregions:  the Western Cross Timbers, Oak Woodlands, and Eastern Cross Timbers.
Cattle raising has been a major economic pursuit in the region and has taken a
toll on the native grasslands.  There are several river valleys that cross the
region.  These valleys are often forested with an abundance of hackberries,
pecans, and oaks.

<HR><B>Region 3 - Blackland Prairies</B>

<P>This region takes in approximately 25,500 square miles.  The Blackland Prairies
once consisted of 12,000,000 acres of tallgrass prairies but due to crops and
grazing, today there is less than 5,000 acres left.  The region has two
subregions, the Blackland Prairies and the Grand Prairies.  The major difference
between the two is that the Grand Prairie has shallower soils and does not
develop the tallgrass communities as the Blackland Prairie does.

<HR><B>Region 4 - Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes</B>

<P>South of the Blackland Prairies and Piney Woods is Region Four, the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes.  This region is around 21,000 square miles and is made up
of three subregions:  Dunes and Barrier Islands, Estuarine Zone, and the Upland
Prairies and Woods.  The region is generally level with an abundance of streams
and rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.  To be such an ecologically valuable
area, with its numerous estuaries, bays and marshes, it has been assaulted with a
variety of human impacts.  Urban growth, industrial expansion with its resulting
pollution, fragmentation of the landscape, and agricultural development have all
added to the heavy burden on the region's ecosystems. 

<HR><B>Region 5 - Coastal Sand Plains</B>

<P>The Coastal Sand Plains is an area of mainly grasslands, extensive clusters of
oaks or oak mottes, and salt marshes.  The land is fairly level and the soil
contains much windblown sand.  As isolated as this portion of the state is, there
has been significant impact from extensive cattle grazing.  During the 19th
Century, the area was noted for large herds of feral horses.  For a time, the
region was called Wild Horse Prairie. 

<HR><B>Region 6 - South Texas Brush Country</B>

<P>Most of the southern tip of the state is a region called the South Texas Brush
Country.  It takes in around 28,000 square miles and is divided into three
subregions:  the Subtropical Zone, Brush Country, and the Bordas Escarpment. 
This area, as its name implies, is a region with an abundance of brush.  The area
had extensive grasslands in the past, but continued grazing, among other factors,
altered the vegetation.  The Brush Country supports an abundance of wildlife. 

<HR><B>Region 7 - Edwards Plateau</B>

<P>The Edwards Plateau is also known as the "Hill Country".  On its eastern and
southeastern boundaries, there is a fairly obvious change from the Blackland
Prairies to the limestone canyons and hills that make up a major portion of the
Plateau.  The area is also noted for its beautiful and mostly clear running
creeks and rivers.  This region is under severe pressure from a growing human
population and the development that comes with it.  The pressure is most severe
in the eastern and southeastern portions of the Plateau, with the expansion of
two large metropolitan areas, Austin and San Antonio. Urban sprawl is taking its
toll on many unique natural features.  In many areas, water is a major issue as
one of the aquifer systems is the primary water source for San Antonio and
numerous other communities, rural residents, and farmers. Excessive pumping,
pollution, and allowing building over the recharge portion of the aquifer
seriously harm this important source of water, not to mention all of the natural
biotic communities that rely on it. 

<HR><B>Region 8 - Llano Uplift</B>

<P>Second to the smallest region, the Llano Uplift comprises around 5,000 square
miles.  This is a very unusual region made up of numerous hills of granite.  The
soils are very sandy and help support the extensive grasslands, Oak-Hickory
woodlands, and mesquite savannah.  The area is mainly used for ranching but is
also noted for producing fine granites for building and other uses.  A very
beautiful and unusual feature of the region is the granite hill complex making up
Enchanted Rock State Natural Area.


<HR><B>Region 9 - Rolling Plains</B>

<P>The Rolling Plains is the largest of the regions, encompassing 43,500 square
miles.  It includes three subregions:  the Mesquite Plains, Escarpment Breaks,
and the Canadian Breaks.  This region, together with the High Plains Region, is
the southern end of the Great Plains of the Central United States.  The Canadian,
the Colorado, the Red, and the Concho Rivers begin in the western portions of the
Rolling Plains and the breaks of the Cap Rock Escarpment.  Excessive grazing and
other improper agricultural practices have caused considerable damage to this
region. 

<HR><B>Region 10 - High Plains</B>

<P>The High Plains is mostly a level, high plateau.  This region is separated from
the Rolling Plains to the east by the Caprock Escarpment.  The area is also noted
for extended droughts and a fairly low average annual rainfall.  Poor
agricultural practices and overgrazing have taken their toll on this region as
well. 

<HR><B>Region 11 - Trans Pecos</B>

<P>In the western-most part of the state, the Trans Pecos region is noted for its
mountain ranges, plateaus, desert valleys, and extensive savannahs.  The main
representation of the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States is found in the
Trans Pecos region.  Oak-Juniper woodlands occur in the various mountain ranges.
This is the second largest region, encompassing around 38,000 square miles.
Several large National and State Parks and State Natural Areas are in the region,
including Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains National Parks, Big Bend Ranch State
Natural Area, and the Davis Mountains State Park.

Location awareness is synonymous to environmental awareness for bioregionalists.
A small nonprofit group in Austin, Texas is putting this concept to practical
purposes through a new and unique method: an Eco-Location Map.

<P>

The Hill Country Foundation recently published a colorful and highly detailed map
of the Austin-area illustrating the geologic and natural history of the region
through graphics and text. The map, worthy of wall-hanging, provides extensive
information about the "ecological lay of the land," noting environmentally
sensitive areas such as aquifer recharge zones, endangered species habitats,
proposed wildlife preserves and sensitive woodlands. A "preferred growth
corridor," located mainly along the city's eastern section which lies in the less
environmentally sensitive Blackland Prairie region, is also noted on the map.

<P>

Inexpensively priced at $3.50, the Foundation is marketing the map to citizens,
businesses and realtors to encourage environmentally-informed decisions when
buying or building a home or locating a business.

<P>

"Because Austin straddles the sensitive Edwards Aquifer and is home to more
listed endangered species than any urbanizing area in the country," says Helen
Ballew, Executive Director of the Hill Country Foundation, "Austin's growth must
be carefully managed so that its natural assets are not inadvertently
squandered."

<P>

By understanding the needs and limitations of the local environmental resources,
the Foundation hopes homeowners and businesses will avoid developing in the most
environmentally sensitive areas.

<P>

Helen says she hopes people use the eco-location map just as bats and whales use
echolocation to avoid obstacles in their path.

<P>

"Most people are concerned for the environment. We want to give them information
they otherwise wouldn't have and trust them to make good choices," she notes.

<P>

The Foundation has conducted workshops on how to use the eco-location map with
area realtor and business groups, as well as with contractors and construction
companies.

<P>

"For a long time it's been thought that what environmentalists do is against
business interests. Protecting the environment makes good economic sense to our
community in the long run."

<P>

The Foundation is currently fundraising to mount additional educational and
promotional initiatives for the eco-location map. In the future they would like
to develop eco-location maps for other cities in the Texas hill country,
including San Antonio. Additionally,  the Foundation is involved in conservation
and  land trust efforts for the hill country.

<P>

In Austin, the eco-location map is available at Whole Foods Markets, Book People,
Miller Blueprint, TravelFest, Venture Map & Globe, Eco-Wise, Barnes & Noble,
Whole Earth Provision Company, Austin Convention & Visitor's Bureau, and the
Eastside Community Farmers' Market.

<P>

For more information about the Hill Country Foundation or the eco-location map,
call 512-478-5743 or write to 1800 Guadalupe, Suite C, Austin, Texas 78701.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Sustainable Living in Strawbale</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Story & Photos by Pamela Colloff</CENTER><BR>
<P>


<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>here are no gas stations or convenience stores on the long, lonely stretch of
Hays County Road outside of San Marcos, Texas. After the occasional pick-up truck
or grazing cow, it dead-ends. A few paces beyond the "No Outlet" sign at the
pavement's end lies an eager black dog and the entrance to Stonehaven Ranch,
where Pam&#233;la Overeynder, 48, lives and works. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/pamela.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=157 HSPACE=5>
"At first, I thought it would be
lonely out here," says Pam&#233;la, "but I really enjoy my own company and the
silence." The ranch -- which serves as a retreat for non-profit groups -- has
several houses, a vegetable patch, a windchime garden, 170 acres of sparsely
wooded land, and lots of time to think. 
<P>


Pam&#233;la serves as a resource for people
who want to build straw bale homes in Texas. After working for Head Start in
Dallas for ten years and then attending art school in Boston, Pam&#233;la was awarded
a grant in the mid-1980s to research the life of Gertrude Duby,
an environmentalist photographer who fought for the preservation of the Lacandon rainforest. While researching Duby's life in Mexico for two years, she
says, "I discovered how deep and wide the environmental crisis was. <P>


"It wasn't until I moved to Mexico that I came to know in
depth of the water crisis, of the species extinction crisis, of the greenhouse
gases, of the deforestation, of global warming." Before this experience, Pam&#233;la
explains, she had spent more time debating which environmental cause to devote
herself to instead of simply taking action. "When I left Mexico in 1989, it was
very clear that all of those pieces were connected. It didn't really matter which
piece you worked on, because they were all connected. I knew it was a major
crisis and I was going to be involved in it one way or another...I became aware
that I needed to become proactive." 
<P>
It wasn't until 1992 when Pam&#233;la was working
for the Austin-based Foundation for a Compassionate Society -- a feminist foundation working for peace and justice -- that her work in the
nuclear freeze movement led her to learn the basics of straw bale building. The
foundation had decided to build a gathering place near a Nevada nuclear test site
on lands that would then be returned to its original owners, the Native Americans
of the Western Shoshone Nation. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/madre.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=294>
"We did the project as a demonstration, showing a
useful, environmentally sane way to build with a low-cost building technology,"
says Pam&#233;la. "I wanted to demonstrate a renewable building material that was not
trashing the environment, and straw is an annually renewable resource. 
<P>
"We
figured if we could convert away from lumber and use straw, we would save a lot
of greenhouse gases," she continues. "In California, at the end of the year, they
burn the straw back. That's a ton of greenhouse gases. We figured that we could
not only take some of the pressure off of forests, but we would prevent a lot of
that burning." 

<P>
Another reason they chose to build with straw is because it is an
excellent insulation material. Since straw bales are solid masses measuring 18
inches wide, they are much thicker, cheaper, and more effective than traditional
insulating materials. So not only does straw bale building significantly cut the
costs of heating and cooling, but also the costs of actual construction; rather
than having to spend a great deal of money on professional construction workers
and contractors, almost anyone with some brief training in straw bale building
can participate in the process. 

<P>Pam&#233;la and several other participants in
the project learned the basic techniques of straw bale building in a workshop at
the Tucson, Arizona organization:  <STRONG>Out on Bale</STRONG>. Then, after a master carpenter
had assisted them in Nevada with laying the foundation of concrete mixed with fly
ash, Pam&#233;la and about ten other participants began to build.<P>

First, Pam&#233;la explained, they lay the bales of straw like bricks, pinned them together with
wooden dowels, and wrapped the bales in chicken wire. Then they applied the first
layer of stucco, which adhered to the chicken wire and dried into the straw. They
applied another layer of stucco, and then a final layer of stucco which was
pigmented a light brown desert tone. 
<A HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/efficiency/straw_insulation/eip/Bainbridge.html">
[For a photo essay on strawbale building see David Bainbridge's slides at Straw Bale Construction]</A><P>
 
"We camped by the site, which we made into a
home base," says Pam&#233;la of the women-led project. "People slept in tents and vans
and under the stars." The foundation was completed in two weeks, and the rest of
the structure was built almost entirely by women in a little over a month. It
currently serves as a place for travelers and nuclear activists to pause and
reflect as well as learn from the caretaker about its construction. 
<P>
Not only does
straw bale building allow people to build their own homes, but it does not
necessitate spending much money -- approximately $20 per square foot. "You can do it
cheaper if you don't hire any of the labor, if you salvage materials, and you
don't pay for architects' plans," says Pam&#233;la. "I've heard of people building
them for $8 to $10 [per square foot]. Convential housing is probably $65 a square
foot, although you can build for less or more." Since heating, cooling, and
maintenence costs are cut at least in half in a straw bale structure, it also
saves money in the long run. 
<P>
Many people are wary of building with straw because
they think it is highly flammable. However, Pam&#233;la explains that fire is not a
concern since straw bales are packed so tightly. As an example, she cites a
structure with a wood roof that had not yet been stuccoed; "Someone torched it
and the roof burned straight to the ground, but the straw bales just got a little
charred on the outside. [Straw bales are] so compacted. You have to have oxygen
to get a good burn." The greatest dangers, if straw is not plastered properly,
are insects and moisture. But, she adds, "if you do it correctly, it literally
doesn't disintegrate. And it's earthquake resistant." 

<P>
Pam&#233;la's work in Nevada
gave her the knowledge and experience to serve as a straw bale resource in Texas.
Many people find her listed in Out On Bale's newsletter, <I>The Last Straw</I>. She
tells people where they can obtain straw, other environmentally friendly building
materials, and blueprints as well as the names of people in specific parts of the
state who are building with straw. 
<P>
While straw bale building may seem like a new
idea, Pam&#233;la points out that it is a traditional building method in some parts of
Europe and Russia. Straw bale building was also popular in Nebraska at the turn
of the century. "They didn't have trees, but they had lots of hay and grain," she
explains. "Every one of them is still inhabited and in good condition. The church
there in Arthur, Nebraska is made of straw and it's a pretty big structure. So it
has a long lifetime and very little maintenance." 
<P>
For Pam&#233;la, straw bale building
is part of a larger idea about how to help the environment. "The idea is that we
get our needs met locally, rather than importing resources and materials from
around the world, because it's very energy consuming," she explains. "There's a
thing called Odom's law, which means that the waste products for one process
are the fuel products for another process; it's about keeping a closed system so
that you don't lose your wealth. You have a closed loop. There's no leakage,
there's no waste. That's an important way for us to learn to live sustainably."

<P>
For several years, Pam&#233;la has been saving up money and drawing floor plans for
her own straw bale home. For the time being, however, she will continue to live
on Stonehaven Ranch, where she can spend her time off sitting in the windchime
garden decorated with small marble statues or cooking with tomatoes from her
vegetable patch. As <I>GreenBeat!</I> is preparing to go, Pam&#233;la is flipping a whole
wheat tortilla over the burner flame. She piles fresh avacado, cilantro pesto,
lemon juice, tomatoes and garlic on top of the tortilla. 
<P>
"If building materials
become so excessively expensive, if they become prohibitive - that's what it's
going to take for the mainstream to look for alternatives. Straw will be in the
wings waiting," she says. "It tickles me to think about an office building made
out of straw. If you built it out of that kind of organic material, you'd almost
have to change what you did inside. Anything is possible."

<FONT SIZE=+2>Building Green Homes & Careers</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Story & Photos by Pamela Colloff</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>J.T. </FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>Irick, 21, is pulling weeds on an unusually hot and humid day in October. Inside
the newly constructed, environmentally friendly home that he helped build on
Austin's East Side, the radio is turned up full blast. Iram Hernandez is pacing
the house with a hammer looking for unfinished odds and ends while Milton
Mitchell's sneakers dangle from the attic trap door as he installs insulation.
<P>
"There's no shade anywhere out here," says J.T., recalling when he, 19-year-old
Iram, 20-year-old Milton, and other volunteers helped lay the house's foundation
during several scorchingly hot weeks in June. 
<P>
Even though it's hard work, J.T. --
who has put an enormous amount of time, energy, and sweat into the house on
Walter Street -- is not complaining. He works seven days a week, both on this
project and at two other jobs, so that he can support himself and save up money
for college. He usually tries to go to bed early, since he must be at the site at
7:30, although he is rather sleepy this morning from having stayed up watching
the World Series. 
<P>
"I don't work on Sunday mornings," he says with a laugh,
explaining that when he calls friends then, they are usually asleep. "That's not
usually a time when people want to hang out!" 
<P>
The Walter Street house, which a
woman will move into the following weekend, is part of the Casa Verde Building
Program -- an attempt to put at-risk youth to work on environmentally friendly
homes for low income families and individuals. The program simultaneously
provides jobs and job training for drop-outs and juvenile criminals, allows
indigent families to own their own homes, rejuvenates disadvantaged
neighborhoods, and demonstrates environmentally friendly and efficent building
materials and techniques. 
<P>
"The first house we worked on took a while, but this
has gone much faster because we have the hang of things. Basically we know what
we need to do, how to do it, and how long it's going to take. Right
now, we're doing touch ups, getting rid of dents, vacuuming, puttying up -- we
call them 'boogers,'" J.T. says with a laugh. 
<P>
The Case Verde program is funded by the community
service organization AmeriCorps. After working 1700 hours on a Casa Verde project
for minimum wage (or $5 an hour for peer trainers like J.T.), workers are given
$4725 for college tuition. Regular paychecks and the discipline of working help
many at-risk youth get back on their feet. 
<P>
It was not very long ago that J.T.,
who just completed his first year in the Casa Verde program, had dropped out of
school and was working a dead-end job he hated. But after a year in the program,
he is not only highly experienced in green building construction and excited to 
learn more in college about the building process, but he is also extremely well-versed in 
environmentally friendly materials and building practices. 
<P>
"Our exterior walls are made of faswall, which is natural fibers that have been
compacted together. It has a very high R rating -- it's supposed to be really good
[for insulating]," he explains. "Our concrete that we use is 12 percent fly ash.
We use cedar trim on the outside of the house, because cedar is a much stronger
wood than pine; it lasts longer. We use metal studs instead of wood studs. We
don't use shingles, we use metal because it lasts longer. These walls
are made out of straw and hay, compacted, with electrical wires bored out in
them. These windows are double-paned windows, so it's harder for the heat or cold
to get inside. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/quote.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=338 HEIGHT=115>
"We're also working on putting solar screens on the houses to cut
the cost of electric bills," says J.T. "The first house that we built which used
all of these different materials has cut the bills in half." 
<P>
J.T. has worked on
this project side-by-side with high school drop-outs, former gang members,
juvenile criminals on probation, and teens from the Brownsville and Giddings
juvenile detention centers. For J.T., the experience working with other people
has been mixed. Although he has made close friends, sometimes he thinks it's
difficult to work collaboratively. 
<P>
"It can be frustrating at times," he says. "I
found out that not everybody likes to work the way I do. Some people like to take
five minute breaks after working for twenty minutes. I grew up in a small town,
small town atmosphere...I'd heard that things were different down here [in
Austin], -- the work ethic. It's been hard." 
<P>
The experience of building a house,
with all of its ups and downs, has made J.T. want to learn more about
construction and apply the techniques of green building to other structures. 
<P>
"I
haven't seen many houses that were built to be environmentally friendly," he
says. "I want to go into construction, maybe working for a corporation or a big
name architect." He hopes to study in a construction management program at Austin Community College, where "you learn how to read blueprints, work with
concrete and wood, lay a foundation." Once he's learned the basics, he can apply
what he's learned from the Casa Verde program. 
<P>
"Not every piece of wood that you
finish with is trash; just because you used it for a concrete form doesn't mean
you can't use it in the attic for a brace," he explains. "There are ways to build
houses that may be a little more expensive because of the material, but in 20 or
30 years, you will have saved money."
<P>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH=72></CENTER>
<P>
The following weekend, J.T. is standing in formal clothes outside of the house on
Walter Street. The lawn has been cleared of extra building materials, as has a
paint-spattered picnic bench. The house's new owner beams as people from the
surrounding neighborhood, city government, AmeriCorps, and the Casa Verde program
mill about the sunny 1300-square-foot home with large windows, a cathedral
ceiling, and a sprawling porch. 
<P>
Since the house was built relatively cheaply with
environmentally friendly materials, the house is extremely affordable. The new
owner put down a down payment of $1500 and must pay between $300 to $400 a month
for the zero-interest mortgage. Although the house is valued at around $65,000,
she will own the house once her payments total $40,000. Not only is the house
affordable, but the cost of upkeep will be minimal; Casa Verde estimates that the
house's utility bills will be half or less than half the bills of a comparably
sized house built with conventional building materials. 
<P>
With light bulbs flashing
and a sprinkling of applause, J.T. smiles, explains to the crowd how the house was
built to save energy and be environmentally friendly, and then presents the new
owner with her keys. "I really enjoy this," he says later, seeming relieved that
the project is completed and anticipating the house he will begin working on the
following week. "I feel like I'm really giving something back to the environment
and the community."

(Above image: a cross-section view of Stramit)</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>traw, once maligned by the three little pigs, is making a comeback as a viable
building material noted for its economy, aesthetics and
environmental-friendliness.<P>

An age-old building material, intact straw has been found in the ancient tombs of
Egyptian pharaohs, in the adobe of pre-Colombian dwellings and in the walls of
Nebraska farmhouses built a century ago. Whether used in making earthen bricks,
strawbale structures or even interior walls, today straw is proving itself
impenetrable to termites and temperature, wind and big bad wolves.<P>

In Perryton, Texas, in the high sweeping plains of the panhandle, a small
business is getting bigger everyday in the manufacturing and sales of compressed
straw walls called Stramit.<P>

"Our growth is due to the rising cost and unavailability of lumber and that
people are looking for environmental alternatives," explained Stramit USA chief
executive Cindy Thyfault.<P>

Straw is often confused with hay. Hay is dried grasses used mostly in the feeding
of livestock; while straw is the by-product left after the harvesting of cereal
grains like wheat, rice, rye and oats.<P>

"Unlike hay, straw itself is very inert and low in protein content. So there is
not protein breakdown in the (Stramit) panels," Thyfault said, debunking the myth
that straw walls easily deteriorate.<P>

According to Thyfault, in America alone more than 200 million tons of straw is
burned or plowed under every year. "With Stramit, this recycled waste produces a
usable and cost-effective material. No water, binder glues or fillers are used in
the production process either," she said.<P>

In the Stramit process, developed in Sweden and widely used in buildings in Great
Britain for more than 40 years, straw is tightly compressed and heated to 500&#176;F
with metal plates. Under this heat and compression, the straw emits its own
resin, bonding into a rigid and durable panel.  A high quality plaster finish on
the outside of the panels give Stramit a traditional interior wall appearance.<P>

Because the straw is compressed so densely, Stramit is extremely fire resistant
and ranks high marks in both thermal insulation and sound ratings.  "And our
customers see a 10-to-30% savings in material costs and a 20-to-50% labor cost
savings as compared with traditional construction materials and methods,"
Thyfault said. "Also, if the time ever comes for demolition, Stramit panels are
totally biodegradable," she added.<P>

Stramit USA recently received a $500,000 grant from the US Department of
Agriculture to continue researching and developing building materials made from
straw, including other wall partition systems and exterior load-bearing walls.
"We're developing value-added products," noted Thyfault.<P>

In the next two years, Thyfault projects tripling her production work crew and
adding another Stramit-process machine to her assembly operations.<P>

While straw was once considered an agricultural waste residue, it now brings
additional revenues to farmers and rural communities like Perryton, Texas. As an annually renewable crop, straw is a perfect
greenbuilding material: inexpensive, energy-efficient, and completely
sustainable.<BR>

Green building concepts stem from the overall question of sustainability - can we
meet our present needs without jeopardizing the future?   Our current building
traditions consume far too many resources and create great amounts of waste.  For
example, the standard wood-framed home consumes over one acre of forest and the
waste created during construction averages from 3 to 7 tons.  This "traditional"
building often exhibits poor performance in energy and water usage plus costly
maintenance requirements. Worldwide, buildings are responsible for 45% of all
energy use, 60% of virgin wood use, 40% of raw stone and processed materials such
as copper, steel, and plastics, and 16% of water withdrawals. The City of Austin
Green Builder Program promotes building practices that improve quality while
still reducing resource use.  The following Green Building Themes are promoted
to inform these choices:<P>

</FONT>


<FONT SIZE=+2>Green Building Themes:</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>

<DL>
	<DT><STRONG>Use recycled and recyclable resources:</STRONG> 
	
<DD>Our active recycling programs will falter if we do not use materials made
with recycled content.  This is called closing the recycling loop.  Similarly,
using resources that can be reused directly or recycled into new products after
use are better choices.

<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="images/greenbuilder.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<DT><STRONG>Use renewable resources:</STRONG>  

<DD>Solar energy, geothermal energy, wood and other plant-based materials that
are harvested in a responsible manner keep us from expending what is called
ecological capital.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Localize resource inputs:</STRONG>
<DD>Buying locally leads to improved management of resources since we can visibly
see our impacts.  It also reduces transportation impacts which require ever
larger roads and energy use.  The "multiplier effect" of cycling money within the
local economy is an additional benefit that creates more economic vitality - an
important facet of a sustainable economy.


<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>Eliminate toxins:</STRONG>  
<DD>Poisonous byproducts obviously do not create a better environment for the
present or the future.  There are alternatives to toxic materials and these
should be used.


<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>Protect and restore Nature:</STRONG>  <DD>Building requirements should
harmonize with or actively enhance ecological integrity. 
<P> 
<DT>
<STRONG>Improve quality:</STRONG>  <DD>Buildings should work well plus be pleasing to
look at and use.


<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>Conserve resources</STRONG>:  <DD>The term conservation should not imply doing
without, it actually means doing more with less.Implementing the above themes
in building can guide us to a sustainable future.  The following specific
principles - in the areas of water, energy, materials, and waste - in building help
implement these themes. 

<P>
</DL> 
<STRONG>Green Building Principles for Water:</STRONG><P>
<OL>

	<LI>Install plumbing fixtures and appliances that use water conservingly.
	<LI>Plant a water efficient landscape - such as xeriscape or permaculture.
	<LI>If landscape watering is required, use an efficient irrigation system with timers, rain sensors, and effective sprayers.
	<LI>Collect rainwater for irrigation or other purposes.
	<LI>Recycle wastewater or greywater for irrigation or other reuse opportunities.
	<LI>Design the landscape to prevent runoff.
	<LI>Make a water budget to better understand the amount and way you use water.
</OL>

<STRONG>Green Building Principles for Energy:</STRONG><P>
<OL>
	<LI>Design the home to use local energy sources such as solar, wind, and the earth's thermal energy.
	<LI>Design to get maximum benefit from both natural and artificial light.
	<LI>Provide for a healthier indoor environment through effective ventilation and carefully-planned electrical system.
	<LI>Save energy with a tight, well-insulated structure and duct system.
	<LI>Install energy efficient appliances, light fixtures, and heating and cooling equipment.
	<LI>Use "waste" heat, such as waste heat from the air conditioner to heat water.
	<LI>Plant a landscape that reduces heating and cooling needs.
</OL>

<STRONG>Green Building Principles for Materials:</STRONG><P>
<OL>
	<LI>Buy lumber that comes from ecologically-managed forests.
	<LI>Choose materials that require low amounts of energy to get from raw material to delivered product (low embodied energy).
	<LI>Avoid materials that are toxic (during production and use) to people and the environment.
	<LI>Select products that are engineered to accomplish more performance with less raw material.
	<LI>Choose materials that are made of recycled and recyclable materials.
	<LI>Use locally produced materials.
	<LI>Use durable materials.
</OL>

<STRONG>Green Building Principles Addressing Waste:</STRONG><P>
<OL>
	<LI>Design for standard-sized materials to reduce waste.
	<LI>Estimate material needs accurately.
	<LI>Choose products that avoid excessive packaging.
	<LI>Construct a secure space, ventilated to the outside, for household hazardous materials.
	<LI>Build in a recycling area in a convenient location  in the building.
	<LI>Provide a composting system for organic wastes.
	<LI>Recycle construction and demolition waste.
</OL>

Green Building, so vast in its scope, embodies still more issues such as the 
reuse of existing buildings especially those located within existing
infrastructures of streets, power and water systems, and with close proximity to
public transportation, stores, and other services.<P>

In summary, Green Building is an approach and a practice.  It is a goal never
complete but constantly worth striving for.  While ecological support and supply
mechanisms evolve within our culture,  the incremental improvements we make now,
take us closer to the sustainability needed to realize our future.<P>

<STRONG>A Sustainable Education</STRONG><P>
</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>

by <STRONG>Carrie Strahan</STRONG><P>
Graduate Student, University of Texas at Austin School of
Architecture<P>

Intern, Green Builder Program - City of Austin Environmental and
Conservation Services Department<P>

</TD>

</TABLE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>

I decided to go back to school and study architecture for two main reasons:
	
	<UL>
	<LI>because of my love of architecture - its eloquent way of blending technology and
	art in a three dimensional form,  <P><LI>and because I was dissatisfied with the current
	building practices.  </UL>
	
I was witnessing a lack of consideration for how the built
environment affected and responded to the natural environment.  Buildings were
going up left and right that did not take into account matters such as solar
access, natural lighting, or material toxicity.  Builders, architects, and
planners do not realize the long term impact their local decisions have on the
earth's natural resources.  A profound concern for the relationship between the
natural and built environment is a underlying philosophy in the profession known
as green building.
<P>
In my search for a college that emphasized green building design and
technologies, I found three schools that offered courses associated with the
green building industry.  They were the University of California at San Diego
(UCSD), Arizona State University (ASU), and the University of Texas at Austin
(UT).  The year I applied to UC San Diego the program was shut down because of
California budget cuts.  Arizona State University only accepted students with an
undergraduate degree in architecture (which I did not have, my undergraduate
degree is in engineering).  This left me with one choice, the University of Texas
at Austin.
<P>
My experience while attending (and still attending) UT is filled with mixed
emotions.  While I enjoy the variety of courses, high level of expertise, and
technical  resources, I find it difficult to find up to date information related
to green building.  And let's face it, there just aren't that many students and
faculty interested in green building issues.  One professor, Michael Garrison,
does concentrate many of his efforts on green building.  He offers a course
called "Sustainable Architecture" which is an introduction to the principles of
green building.  The course includes a series of lectures from builders,
architects, policy makers, and planners who are actively involved in green
building issues.  Last fall, Professor Garrison devoted an entire studio to
designing a sustainable village using a prescribed set of green building
principles.  The assignment was an actual project in Big Bend National Park in
southwest Texas to house Park employees and many of the students' ideas were
adopted into the Master Plan.  The project began construction last October. 
There are other examples of architecture courses that touch upon environmentally
sensitive issues, but as an overall design philosophy, green building design
takes a back seat to other issues.  And, while it is recognized that the intent
of a graduate program in architecture is to introduce the student to a variety of
options, it also seems pertinent to keep up with current concerns.  Because of
the growing amount of environmental degradation from bad building practices,
concern for the physical environment and discussion of architectural solutions
warrants significant attention.
<P>
To further my knowledge of green building issues, I realized I had to go beyond
the walls of University.  Fortunately, Austin has a wide variety of learning
environments in terms of green building options.  First, there is the Sustainable
Building Coalition, a local non-profit organization comprised of architects,
builders, homeowners, and others that are interested in sharing their knowledge. 
Monthly meetings feature a lecture series with topics such as Healthy Home
Design, Photovoltaics, and Alternative Wastewater Systems, to name a few. 
Secondly, The City of Austin Environmental and Conservation Services Department
has a Green Builder Program.  This program is recognized worldwide for their
commitment to encouraging resource conservation, reducing resource usage, and
promoting energy efficiency.  These two programs offer high level of hands-on
experience and expertise and have greatly enhanced my knowledge of green building
issues.
<P>
Now some may ask, why get a formal degree when most of the information is "out
there", in the real world?  Good question.  It is because a formal education
offers benefits that cannot be found "out there".  It offers a historical and
theoretical perspective that can shed light into the how and why buildings are
built, and discloses where the roots of green architecture originate.  Green
building roots can be found in many other types of building philosophies: in
indigenous architecture's use of local materials; in the visions behind some of
Frank Lloyd Wright's work and his reference to nature, and even in some aspects
of Modernism.  In short, it serves as a foundation on which to build upon.  It is
like taking a ballet class and learning the proper techniques before trying a
modern dance class; one must learn the basic movements and positions before
diverging from them.
<P>
Green building is a burgeoning line of architecture and the academic environment
cannot keep up with the pace.  Networking, meeting people, attending workshops,
taking classes, and hands-on experience are all needed to keep up with the
current green building technologies.  A formal education combined with hands-on
experience complement each other in a way that better prepares me for my future. 
As in any new, fast growing field of study, it is wise to keep abreast of all
kinds of information in whatever way it becomes available.<P>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>amara Saltman is poring over her
environmental law books when Greenbeat catches up with her in Ithaca, New York. 
Although it's only a few weeks into her senior year at Cornell University, Tamara
already has her work cut out for her.  In addition to earning a Bachelor of
Science Degree from the university's Natural Resources Ecology program, she is
leading an effort to improve water quality for the Mohawk Native American tribe
in upstate New York.

<P>"It wasn't your average summervacation," Tamara says modestly.  A native of 
Austin, Texas, Tamara's most recent environmental challenge has been developing
a water quality monitoring program with the Mohawks' Environmental
Taskforce. 

<IMG SRC="images/tamara1.jpeg" ALT="Tamara Saltman" ALIGN=RIGHT
HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=270>

<P>According to Tamara, the Mohawks' water quality problems
began back in 1959 with the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
"There are four rivers that come together in this area [where] the
Mohawks have hunted and fished for ages," she says, explaining that the
Seaway's hydropower capabilities brought industry into the area.  "There
are a number of industrial plants around the reservation which have
polluted the river sediment with heavy metal contamination and PCBs."


<P>Tamara teamed up with Cornell chemistry Professor Steve Penningroth
this summer to advance the tribe's water monitoring program.  The
Mohawks have previously tested their water by shipping samples out to a
lab, but "now we're putting the tools in the hands of the community,"
says Tamara. 

<P>Water monitoring is just one function of the tribe's
Environmental Taskforce. This summer, the Taskforce tested mothers'
breast milk for toxins which can be accumulated by eating the local
fish.  Test results show that industrial contamination has taken its
toll; the breast milk of women living on one of the reservation's
islands shows higher levels of PCBs than the breast milk of women in
other parts of the state.  In response to such dangers, the tribe is
developing an aquaculture project designed to raise fish in cages up
off the river bottom so they do not contact the contaminated sediment.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/wes.jpeg" ALT="Wes Halverson" ALIGN=LEFT
HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=194>

Tamara has been involved with water-based environmental issues since
she was in high school in Austin, Texas.  She cites her mentor and
friend Dr. Wes Halverson, an environmental science teacher then working
at the LBJ Science Academy, as one of the reasons she is now working to
protect the environment.  "Wes was really involved in environmental
work.  I worked closely with him and drew a lot of inspiration to work
in the field of water quality.  It was something that I could really
devote myself to."


<P>Through Wes' guidance, Tamara became involved with
the Colorado River Watch Network, a group of student and citizen
volunteers who test water quality along the Colorado River from north
central Texas to the Gulf.  "River Watchers aren't just science nerds,"
notes Tamara.  "They are directly involved in making Texas a better
place to live." 


<P>Armed with water quality data, Tamara and other LBJ
High School students lobbied the Austin City Council for a stronger
water quality ordinance.  Dr. Halverson remembers how Tamara - who was
not an experienced public speaker - quietly presented a convincing and
well researched argument to the council. The students were successful
with their message and the council responded with a ban on
phosphate-based detergents in the City. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/reillylrs.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="EPA's Reilly" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8
WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=259>

This accomplishment drew the
attention of the former head of the EPA, William Reilly, who visited
the program in 1991.  "I remember sitting up all night, going over and
over what we were going to say," says Tamara.  "I remember being very
nervous the next day before the presentation but once we started
talking, and explaining all the work we had done, I found I was able to
relax.  Afterwards, when the meeting broke up, we walked down to the
river and I got to talk to Mr. Reilly much more informally.  That was
really wonderful." 

<P>During Christmas break of her freshman year at
Cornell, Tamara tested her skills again.  The River Watch needed
someone to write a grant proposal to the United States Information
Agency (U.S.I.A.) for an exchange program with Russia.  "The people who
normally write the grant proposals were busy with other projects, so I
said I'll do it! and I started writing." 

<P>A few months later, Tamara -
who was only 18 when she wrote the proposal for $59,0000 - found out
that it had been accepted.  These funds sponsored the exchange progam
which began in the summer of 1994; 15 Austin River Watchers journeyed
to Russia for a raft trip down the Volga River.  In the process, they
learned about the ecology of the Volga and exchanged information on
their water quality monitoring procedures with their Russian
counterparts.  This past summer, <A HREF="extra.html">
15 Russian students came to Texas</A> and
learned about our water monitoring techniques while canoeing the
Colorado River. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/quote.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Quote" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10
WIDTH=215 HEIGHT=74>

<P>"I think the river trips helped sell the proposal, "
says Tamara.  "We really wanted these students to get to know and even
depend on each other, instead of just shaking hands. That really caught
the eye of the U.S.I.A.  That experience made me a lot more confident. 
I thought if I could write that grant on my Christmas vacation, then I
could do a lot of other things." 

<P>Her skill and determination has paid
off.  Last semester Tamara was hired by Cornell University to write the
management plan for the Arnot Forest, a piece of land donated to
Cornell's Department of Natural Resources at the turn of the century. 
The land - which includes a camp, a stream, and acres of forest - has
been underutilized by Cornell students and staff.  The Department was
trying to find ways to increase use of the property or sell it. 
	"What I found is that most people didn't even know it existed," says
Tamara.  "My recommendation was that with relatively little money the
Department could publicize the camp and let people know what it had to
offer.  This way they could generate a fund for improvements to the
campground." 

<P>After graduating, Tamara plans to study either water
resources or aquatic ecology in graduate school.  "I've had times where
I haven't known exactly what it is that I want to do. Lots of times!"
she says, laughing. "But as far as being involved in the environmental
movement as a whole, I don't have any doubts."<P>

Student and citizen volunteer water quality monitoring programs are a hotbed for
science education, for gathering needed environmental data, and for developing
careers and contacts that lead to jobs!  Many progressive education programs
have realized that students learn science much better if they gather actual
environmental data in the field.  Our rapidly growing Internet is proving to be
an important tool for these programs to centralize and share water quality data
and related information.  For tens of thousands of students across the country,
these programs are the starting point for an environmental career.

In Texas for instance, students working with the Colorado River Watch Network
(CRWN) have been active for nearly a decade, measuring water quality along 660
river miles that make up the lower Colorado River. The Texas Watch program run
by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) serves nearly
20,000 members with programs around the state.
<P>
Among the largest of the water monitoring groups is GREEN (the Global Rivers
Environmental Education Network) which began in the mid 1980's in the Great Lakes
region of the U.S.  Today, GREEN's membership extends to 125 countries and all 50
states.  While the most direct goal of GREEN is environmental education and data
gathering, this program sets an important precendent for global environmental
cooperation.
<P>

Similar to GREEN, but not limited to water quality, is the White House's Project
GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment.),  the
program is taylored for the gradeschool level.  According to Vice President Al
Gore, one of GLOBE's chief supporters, "GLOBE students are young scientists, tens
of thousands strong, learning about Planet Earth and then teaching us."  GLOBE's
students are working with teachers and scientists to develop a coherent picture
of environmental systems and their accompanying challenges.

The study of water pollution is generally divided in two catagories: Point Source
Pollution and Non-Point Source Pollution:

<P>
<B>Point Source</B> pollution is contamination that is directly traceable to a source
such as a factory, a sewer pipe or an oil spill.  Because it is directly
traceable to a source, point source pollution is more easily controlled than
non-point source pollution.  It is also a problem more easily stopped through
strict regulation.

<P>
<B>Non-Point Source</B> (NPS) pollution, on the other hand, makes up the vast majority
of pollution and is more difficult to trace and therefore to treat. NPS 
pollution is the name given to the contaminated waters that runs off the land
after a rain.  It is the result of roadway runoff, overuse of pesticides and
fertilizers in agriculture and other chemicals used in daily life.  Non- point
source pollution is the residue of a society with cheap and ready access to
potential pollutants.  Non-point source pollution is  also the most serious
problem facing water quality around the country.  Unlike its counterpart, point
source pollution, which can be reduced through tougher legal standards, reduction
of non-point source pollution requires behavioral change.

<P>
<B>Water Quality Monitors sample streams for some of the following parameters:
</B>

<P>

<IMG SRC="images/inject.jpeg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=183 ALT="Testing Water" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Dissolved Oxygen (DO)</B>: is an essential element for the survival of aquatic plants
and animals. Oxygen enters water naturally though gradual absorption  or through
a wave/tumbling action which physically mixes both elements. In addition, the
photosynthesis of water-based plants also produces the oxygen needed to support a
stable and diverse ecosystem. 

<P>
While constant high readings of oxygen indicate a
healthy waterway, the introduction of large amounts of organic matter can bring
about rapid depletion of oxygen levels and lead to massive fish kills. This
phenomena is due to the chemical demands of organic decomposition.

<P>
<B>Fecal Coliform</B>: Fecal coliform are bacteria from the feces of warm-blooded
animals (including humans). By themselves, these bacteria do not cause illness or
disease but their presence in large numbers may indicate the presence of other
harmful organisms. Fecal coliform counts are often highest at flood stages when
untreated water may enter the waterway. Persons contacting water with high fecal
coliform counts may subject themselves to the dangers of the associated malevolent
organisms.

<P>
<B>pH</B>: The assigned pH value indicates whether a body of water is acidic, neutral,
or basic. Most organisms thrive in near neutral waters but the increase of
emissions from automobiles and industry  have threatened lake and stream habitat
with the consequences of acid rain.

<P>
<B>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</B>: This measurement checks the amount of organic
matter in water and the quantity of oxygen it demands. Organic matter occurs
naturally from vegetation but greater concern is given to human induced organic
matter from industry and wastewater treatment plants.

<P>
<B>Temperature</B> plays a large role in the physical, biological and chemical
characteristics of a river. Changes in temperature can affect dissolved oxygen
levels, aquatic plant growth rates, and the metabolism and health of aquatic
organisms. Among other factors, the number of shade trees along a streambank can
be vital.


<P>
<B>Phosphorus</B> is a naturally occuring, organic element essential to the the life of
a stream. However, when high levels of inorganic phosphorus like laundry
detergents and fertilizers are introduced the results can devastate the oxygen
content and the life of the stream with excessive algal blooms.


<P>
<B>Nitrogen</B> is another element fundamental to the growth of plants and animals. If
nitrogen levels increase dramatically, for instance, the plants and
micro-organism life can explode and exhaust the oxygen support of the stream.


<P>
<B>Ammonia</B>: This is a product of natural decomposition, but high levels can indicate
sewage leaks.


<P>

<IMG SRC="images/net.jpeg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=190 ALT="Students Sample Water Solids with a Net" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<B>Turbidity</B>: Murky water holds suspended solids like clay, silt, and industrial
waste. These solids work against the life supporting qualities of a stream and
increase the water's ability to absorb heat. Furthermore, toxics (insecticides,
etc.) bind to these sediments and may be picked up in the food chain.


<P>
<B>Total Solids</B>: This is a cumulative measure of some of the above parameters and
more (salt, debris, etc.). This index offers an indication of the collective
quality of the water from an aquatic life perspective.


<P>
<B>Bioassessment</B>:  This is a study focused on the presence (or absence) of certain
bottom dwelling insect larvae and aquatic life. Bioassessment is vital in guaging
the overall quality of a stream since chemical monitoring may miss pollution
entering the stream on any given day.<P></FONT>

responsibilities and enforcement options that the government may exercise in the
event of non-compliance by potentially responsible parties. This Order is signed
by PRPs and the government; it does not require approval by a judge.<p>

ADMINISTRAVTIVE RECORD: The collection of documents which forms the basis for the
selection of a response action at a Superfund site. EPA is required to establish
an administrative record file for every Superfund site and make a copy available

a technique called straw bale construction.<p>

AGRICULTURAL FIBER: Agricultural fibers (i.e., cotton) are being introduced for
use as insulation materials.<p>

ALGAE BLOOM: A phenomenon whereby excessive nutrients within a river, stream or lake 
causes an explosion of plant life which results in the depletion of the oxygen in the  
water needed by fish and other aquatic life. Algae bloom is usually the result of  
urban runoff (of lawn fertilizers, etc.). The potential tragedy is that of a "fish kill," 
where the stream life dies in one mass extinction.<P>

to cause it to rise above the zone of saturation if the opportunity were afforded
for it to do so.<p>

ARTESIAN WATER: Water that comes from artesian wells.<p>

ARTESIAN WELL: A well tapping a confined or artesian aquifer in which the static
water level stands above the top of the aquifer. The term is sometimes used to
include all wells tapping confined water. Wells with water level above the water
table are said to have positive artesian head, (pressure) and those with water
level below the water table, negative artesian head.<p>

ARTESIAN WALL: A well made by drilling into the earth until water is reached
which, from internal pressure, flows up like a fountain.<p>

coolant and moderator, is allowed to boil in the core. The resulting steam can be
used directly to drive a turbine generating electric power.<p>

BORATE-TREATED WOOD: Borate is a mineral product derived from borax. Treating
wood with borates has been done in New Zealand and Australia for many years (for
insect and moisture protection). Commercial applicability' is being researched in
the U.S. with a major effort geared toward preventing the borates from leaching
out in the presence of moisture. Borates are commonly used to treat cellulose

heat energy equal to the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one
gram water one degree Celsius. The calorie is used when temperature is measured
on the Celsius scale. The British Thermal Unit is used when the measurement is on
the Fahrenheit scale. One calorie equals 4.14 joules. A calorie is also the
amount of food which contains the energy producing value of one calorie.<p>

CANCELLED WATER RIGHT: A water right that is made void either at the request of
the water right holder or due to forfeiture.<p>

block of all living matter. The cell of a living thing contains a high percentage
of water. In solid waste disposal, one of a series of holes in a landfill where
waste is dumped, compacted, and covered with layers of dirt.<p>

CELLULOSE: The fibrous part of plants used in making paper and textiles, which in
turn may be made into building products.<p>

CELLULOSE INSULATION WITH BORATES: Cellulose insulation made from recycled
newspaper treated with borates to provide fire and vermin protection. Most

established that oversee the harvesting of wood for lumber. The underlying
guideline is preservation of a diverse forest that exhibits the same ecological
characteristics as a healthy natural forest. There are few wood products
presently being certified.<p>

CFC/HCFC: Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrogen chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) are
considered major contributors to the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer. HCFC
is, 1/20th as potent as CFC in its ozone-destroying capacity. Any amount of
additional threat to the ozone layer can be dangerous, due to the long term
potency of CFCs. The current ozone damage is generally attributed to CFCs
released 10 to 15 years ago. Twenty percent of ozone damage is caused by CRCs in
insulation.<p>

CHECK DAM: A small dam constructed in a gully or other small water course to
decrease the streamflow velocity, minimize channel erosion, promote deposition of

and educate the public affected by a Superfund site. This plan addresses all the
avenues of communication to be used in a community, such as public open houses,
fact sheets, workshops, and notices. It contains a list of interested citizens,
citizens groups, local repositories, Federal, State, and local officials. The CRP
is a CERCLA requirement meant to address a community's needs and concerns. A copy
of the Plan is part of the file with the Administrative Record in the local
repository.<p>

COMPARATOR: An instrument with a calibrated color wheel used to determine the
concentraiton of various parameters.<p>

into a rich fertilizer. Several commercial models are available that prevent
odors and thwart animals.<p>

COMPOST-CONNECTED DISPOSAL: A disposal that grinds food waste into a container
where it is separated from the water rather than flowing into the waste water
system. The contained food waste can then be composted.<p>

COMPOSTING TOILET - Several commercial composting toilets are available that
effectively compost human waste. The process requires no water and does not
create a health odor problem when the toilet properly installed.<p>

COMPOUND: A substance composed of separate elements, ingredients, or parts. Water
is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen.<p>

at the time it was deposited. It is usually highly mineralized.<p>

CONSENT DECREE: A legal document, approved and issued by a judge, formalizing an
agreement between EPA and the parties potentially responsible for site
contamination. The decree describes cleanup actions that the potentially
responsible parties are required to perform and/or the costs incurred by the
government that the parties will reimburse, as well as the roles,
responsibilities, and enforcement options that the government may exercise in the

or estuarine basin. Boundaries of bay and estuarine segments (identified with the
number 24 as the first two digits) have not been precisely defined and are
illustrated as approximations at this time. <p>

STREAM: A general term for a body of flowing water. In hydrology the term is
generally applied to the water flowing in a natural channel as distinct from a
canal. More generally, it is applied to the water flowing in any channel, natural
or artificial. Some types of streams: 1. Ephemeral: A stream which flows only in
direct response to precipitation, and whose channel is at all times above the
water table. 2. Intermittent or Seasonal: A stream which flows only at certain
times of the year when it receives water from springs, rainfall, or from surface
sources such as melting snow. Perennial: A stream which flows continuously.3.
Gaining: A stream or reach of a stream that receives water from the zone of
saturation. An effluent stream. 4. Insulated: A stream or reach of a stream that
neither contributes water to the zone of saturation nor receives water from it.
It is separated from the zones of saturation by an impermeable bed. 5. Losing: A
stream or reach of a stream that contributes water to the zone of saturation. An
influent stream. 6. Perched: A perched stream is either a losing stream or an
insulated stream that is separated from the underlying ground water by a zone of
aeration. 6. SWAMPS: Shallow lakes where a small depth of water and a slight
range of fluctuation permits the growth of aquatic vegetation.<p>

STREAMFLOW DEPLETION: The amount of water that annually flows into a valley or
onto a particular land area minus the amount that flows out of thevalley or away
from the particular land area. It is also the amount of water taken from a
stream.<p>

STREAMFLOW: The discharge that occurs in a natural channel. Although the term
discharge can be applied to the flow of a canal, the word streamflow uniquely
describes the discharge in a surface stream course. The term &Ograve;"streamflow"
is more general than runoff, as stream flow may be applied to discharge whether
or not it is affected by diversion or regulation. <p>

<H2>Water-Related Facts</H2>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
The EPA estimates that each American household generates 20 pounds of
home-chemical waste each year, much of which is disposed of improperly and ends
up in rivers, lakes and aquifers.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=6  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Evaporation purifies water, changing it from liquid into vapor, but concentrates 
pollutants in the water which remain unevaporated. <P>


<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
An adult drinks about 2 liters of water a day. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Water makes up 70% of the planet's surface area. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HSPACE=8 WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Only 3% of the earth's water is freshwater. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=6  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
The world's available water per capita has decreased by more than one-third since
1970 due to the more than 1.8 billion peopled added to the planet since then. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=6  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
Using drip- or micro-irrigation systems tremendously reduces agricultural water use and
can acheive an astounding 95% efficiency rate.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/droplet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 VSPACE=10  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=24>
The overuse of groundwater -- pumping out water faster than it is naturally recharged
 -- is causing water shortages in many regions of the 
 world, including much of China, Africa, and the Western United States. In Mexico City,
 water pumping exceeds recharge rate by 80%, causing buildings to sink.<P>

<A NAME="MANAGEMENT">Management</A> of water resources in Texas is a complex task. Consider just a few factors: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Geographical variations cause large disparities in available water supplies, from water shortages in arid West Texas to abundant supplies in the eastern portion of the state. 
<P>
<LI>A growing population and industrial base will continue to increase pressure on existing supplies and generate demand for development of additional water delivery facilities such as reservoirs. 
<P>
<LI>Reliance on groundwater is facing serious limitations in many areas of the state due to overpumping and water quality problems. 
<P>
<LI>Even though all water forms part of the same hydrological cycle, the Texas institutional structure for managing water quantity and protecting water quality is divided among several state and local government agencies charged with implementing a convoluted set of statutes and court decisions.

<H4><A NAME="MUCH">HOW MUCH WATER IN TEXAS?</A></H4>
<P>
Texas receives about 366 million acre-feet of rain annually. In the period from 1940 to 1970, surface runoff varied from 23 to 57 million acre-feet per year. Average annual flow is about 49 million acre-feet.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#1">(1)</A> Levels of precipitation and run-off vary greatly across the state. In the eastern portion, precipitation averages 56 inches per year; in West Texas, annual rainfall is only about eight inches.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#2">(2)</A> This rainfall feeds 191,228 miles of streams and rivers contained in 15 major river basins and eight coastal basins, 5,700 inland reservoirs which comprise over 3 million square acres, nearly a million square miles of bays, almost 8 million acres of wetlands and vast underground storage areas known as aquifers.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#3">(3)</A> 
<P>
Texas has only one natural lake - Caddo Lake in East Texas. The other 5,700 lakes have been constructed by humans.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#4">(4)</A> About 97 percent of the surface water consumed by Texas is drawn from 191 reservoirs that each hold more than 5,000 acre-feet of water.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#5">(5)</A> Approximately 11 million acre-feet of 
surface water are available for human use at Texas major reservoirs. At present, the state uses only about 65 percent of this dependable yield.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  One acre-foot is equal to 325,851 gallons - an area about the size of a football field covered with one foot of water.<P>
	<CITE>Texas Water Development Board, Texas Water Facts, <A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#4">(4) </A></CITE>.
</UL>
<P>
Texas also has an estimated 3 to 4 billion acre-feet of groundwater stored in nine major aquifers and 20 minor aquifers, underground natural rock formations which hold groundwater. However, only about 10 percent of this groundwater is recoverable using traditional technology.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
In addition to these available groundwaters, each year about 5.3 million acre-feet of annual rainfall recharges the state's aquifers. In 1990, the 8.9 million acre-feet of water pumped from underground exceeded natural recharge - the downward replenishing flow of rainfall through the soil to the aquifer.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#7">(7)</A> The Texas Water Development Board projects that by 2040, the state will decrease its groundwater use to about 5.7 million acre-feet of groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#8">(8)</A>
<H4>
<A NAME="USES">WHO USES THE WATER?</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texans pump, push, pull, consume and discharge water for all kinds of uses. Statewide, demands for water totaled about 15.8 million acre-feet in 1990, with groundwater use equaling about 56 percent of total use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#9">(9)</A> Water use in Texas can be divided into six major categories. Irrigation, municipal use 
and manufacturing together accounted for nearly 95 percent of all water consumed in 1990. Steam-electric-power generation, livestock watering and mining together accounted for 5 percent of consumption in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#10">(10)</A><P>

<A NAME="OWNER">WATER OWNERSHIP IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Despite their interrelatedness in the hydrological cycle, groundwater and surface water are treated differently in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#11">(11)</A>Surface water bodies are the property of the state but the right to use surface water for specific purposes such as irrigation or mining is a private property right. Today, these "water rights" are regulated by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Groundwater is privately owned: it belongs to the owner of the land above it and the owners may pump all the water they can from beneath their land regardless of the impact to nearby landowners.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#12">(12)</A>

</CENTER><P>
<H4>
<A NAME="18TH">EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURY WATER LAW</A>
</H4>
<P>
The history of water regulation in Texas began with the Spanish settlers in Texas. Spanish water law required specific authorization to use water. The Spanish (and later Mexican) type of water law evolved into the "prior appropriation" doctrine which holds that water "rights" are separate and apart from the rights of land ownership, much like oil and mineral rights are today separate from land ownership.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#13">(13)</A> However, in the 1800s Anglo-American settlers in Texas introduced English common law for claiming the use of water. This water law establishes the right of use based upon ownership of land. The owner of land adjacent to a river had the right to fish that river or divert water for irrigation, or otherwise make use of it. These property-based water rights are legally referred to as "riparian" rights, after a Latin word that means pertaining to the bank or shore of a river or lake. Groundwater was likewise attached to the property above it; landowners were free to pump whatever they could from wells dug on their property.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 6, Air  
Quality, Page 1
</H5>
Air pollution can be hazardous to human health. When people breathe dirty air, pollutants may come into direct contact with their lungs. Polluted air can burn eyes, irritate throats and affect breathing. Some chemicals emitted to the air can cause adverse health effects if released in large enough quantities or over a long enough time. These health effects could include cancer, birth defects, damage to the brain, nervous system or respiratory tract and even, in rare instances, death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#1">(1)</A>
<P>
Air pollution also threatens plants, animals and the natural environment. Acid rain can destroy lakes, rivers and the organisms that inhabit them. Certain compounds degrade the ozone layer above the earth, which serves as a filter for the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The thinning of this upper level atmospheric ozone layer may lead to higher rates of skin cancer and eye damage for both humans and animals. Other pollutants may stunt the growth of trees and vegetation, including agricultural crops, while increased carbon dioxide levels have been found to actually stimulate plant growth, emphasizing the complexity of air pollution problems. 
<P>
Common air pollutants can also damage property, dirtying buildings and corroding monuments and statues. And the haze produced by air pollution can reduce visibility, affecting a number of activities including airplane transportation and tourism.

<P>
<P>
The first efforts to deal legislatively with visible air pollution were directed at smoke emissions from steam boilers. Cincinnati and Chicago passed smoke regulations in 1881; Ohio passed a law to limit these emissions in 1897. It wasn't until the 1940s, however, that new designs which reduced black smoke and saved fuel were phased into factories.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#2">(2)</A> Much less effort was directed at controlling the grime and pollutants generated by oil and gas refineries, factory smokestacks, coal-burning locomotives and automobiles.
<P>
By the 1960s, new concerns were being raised about urban "smog." Smog is a haze made up of thousands of different compounds. Ozone is its most well known constituent. In fact, excessive ground level ozone is the most pervasive air pollution problem in the U.S., creating both health and environmental effects.
<P>
It may seem strange that too little ozone in the upper atmosphere is a problem while too much ozone on ground level is also a problem. However, these types of seeming contradictions are part and parcel of the interrelated air pollution control problems facing us today (see "What is Air Pollution?").
<P>
Smog and other air pollutants are particularly damaging when "trapped" at ground level. This may happen in areas that have experienced a temperature inversion, a meteorological phenomenon in which a warm layer of air lies under a cooler, denser layer. A temperature inversion creates a kind of atmospheric blanket that can prevent pollutants generated on the ground from escaping into the upper atmosphere. When a temperature inversion lingers in an area and winds are calm, air pollutants become concentrated. The results can be deadly; in 1948, a temperature inversion over the Pennsylvania town of Donora resulted in the deaths of 20 people and hospitalized hundreds when sulfur, ozone and air particulates were trapped at ground level.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#3">(3)</A>
<P>
In the wake of the Donora incident, Congress passed a series of bills to study and research the problem of air pollution. But it was not until the 1960 presidential campaign that political leaders began calling for a coordinated, national approach to the problem of air pollution. This concern over air pollution was focused first on the most visible forms of air pollution: smoke, smog and haze. Gradually, legislation has come to address less visible air pollution problems, such as toxic compounds, as well. 
<H4>
<A NAME="EVENTS">EVENTS IN THE QUEST FOR CLEANER AIR
</A></H4>
<P>
The following mark significant air pollution events and important steps taken to prevent their recurrence:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>  1948: </B>Air pollution trapped by a temperature inversion in Donora, Pennsylvania results in more than 6,000 inhabitants becoming sick and 20 deaths. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1952: </B>A 5-day temperature inversion in London in December, 1952 causes smoke from open fireplaces and industrial emissions to sicken thousands of Londoners and results in the premature deaths of 4,000 people, many of whom had preexisting heart and lung conditions.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#4">(4)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1963: </B>The Federal Clean Air Act provides funds to support state and local air pollution agencies, to initiate interstate air pollution research and to enforce interstate pollution laws. Because the main policy thrust is the protection of human health, this act is administered by the Public Health Service of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1965: </B>The Texas Air Control Board is created under the Texas Clean Air Act to protect Texas air quality by setting standards, criteria levels and emission limits. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1966: </B>A temperature inversion traps urban air pollution for three days in New York City. Epidemiologists attributes the deaths of 168 people to the episode.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1967: </B>A revised Air Quality Act authorizes HEW to establish federal air-quality standards, requires states and local entities to monitor their "airsheds" - the air located above so-called air quality control regions covering 247 metropolitan areas throughout the U.S. - and requires states to establish standards for specific pollutants in these air quality control regions. However, only 21 states submit their required plan to HEW by the time the 1967 Act expires in 1970.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#7">(7)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1970: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act limit emissions from cars, factories and power plants. The allowable level of sulfur dioxide from utility smokestacks is reduced; refineries are required to phase out lead from gasoline; and automakers are required to cut emissions by 90 percent by 1975. (Congress later gave the automobile industry until 1978 to meet auto air pollution standards after fierce opposition.) The 1970 Act also gives the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the power to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to protect human health and secondary standards to protect the environment. States are required to develop and implement plans to reduce air pollution to levels below these national standards by 1975. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1971: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorize the Texas Air Control Board to issue air quality permits, which begin the following year. Sources of air pollution constructed before 1971, however, are "grandfathered" under the Texas Clean Air Act and do not need to obtain a state permit. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1972: </B>Texas submits the first State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to the EPA detailing measures for meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within the state for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, total suspended particulates and ozone. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1973: </B>The Arab Oil Embargo leads Congress to pass the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1973. To ease pressure on the oil supply, the act requires power plants to switch their fuel sources from oil and natural gas to more polluting coals. It also temporarily suspends emission limits on power plants and other stationary sources like refineries.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1977: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act require companies to install new pollution-control equipment or face stiff penalties. The law also allows states to adopt emission limitations more stringent than federal standards and requires that coordinated transportation planning and clean air planning must take place at the local level. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>The EPA relaxes the national ambient air quality standards for ozone, raising the permissible level from 0.08 to 0.12 parts per million.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>Texas submits a revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board for achieving the NAAQS by December 1982 which results in significant emissions reductions from industry of criteria pollutants in most areas of the state. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1983: </B>The EPA decides to allow states additional time to submit State Implementation Plan revisions, where needed, and to negotiate the control strategy and rule provisions required to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1984: </B>An industrial accident in Bhopal, India at a Union Carbide plant spews methyl isocyanate gas into the local area, killing more than 2,500 people, and hospitalizing tens of thousands.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#8">(8)</A> The event leads to international pressure for better emergency response plans at manufacturing plants and information regarding toxics releases.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>An accident at a Union Carbide plant in Institute, West Virginia sends a poisonous plume of aldicarb oxime over the town, sending 135 people to the hospital. Only a new chemical batching process, instituted at the West Virginia plant after the Bhopal accident, prevents the release of the more toxic methyl isocyanate.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#9">(9)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorizes the Texas Air Control Board to levy administrative penalties for violations of state and national air quality regulations and operating permits are required to be reviewed at 15-year intervals. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1986: </B>The Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act requires companies to report to the Environmental Protection Agency both regular and accidental releases to the air, water or land of more than 300 toxic chemicals. The act also requires manufacturing companies to develop emergency response plans to use in the event of an accident.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1987: </B>Texas submits a substantially revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to satisfy EPA requirements for demonstrating attainment of the ozone standard by the end of 1991. In addition, the agency's vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program is expanded to counties surrounding several ozone non-attainment cities. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1990: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the most far-reaching air pollution prevention legislation ever passed, address airborne toxics, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer, and toughen regulations on vehicles, utilities and other sources of smog-producing emissions. 

	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1993: </B>The Texas Air Control Board, the Texas Water Commission and other agencies related to water pollution control merge to form the newly-created Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

<A NAME="POLLUTION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>What is Air Pollution?</th></tr>
<tr><td>There are many different aspects of air pollution. Whether the pollution is likely to cause environmental or health effects depends on the concentration of pollutants and the amount of time an individual or other receptor is exposed to them. 
<P>
<B>Smog</B> is an often visible haze made up of thousands of constituents, the most abundant, but not necessarily the most toxic of which is ozone. Ozone, especially at elevated levels, can create breathing problems particularly in the young, the old and persons with existing health problems by reducing lung function, increasing sensitivity to asthma and aging lung tissue. It is suspected to irritate the eyes, cause nasal congestion and reduce resistance to colds and other infections. Ozone at elevated levels is toxic to other living organisms as well; it damages plants and trees by affecting the stability of cell walls.
<P>
<B>Particulate matter</B>, produced by the burning of wood, diesel and other fuels, by agricultural activities and industrial processes and by traffic on unpaved roads, is made up of ash, smoke, soot, dust, fibers and liquid droplets. Particulate matter produces a haze that can cause visibility problems. It also dirties and damages buildings and clothes. Smaller particulates, which float in the air, can be inhaled deeply and, with elevated concentrations over an extended period of time, can cause lung damage and bronchitis.<I> </I>Recent studies have linked exposure to these smallest particles to a greater risk of premature death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#5">(5)</A>
<P>
<B>Nitrogen oxides </B>result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, gasoline and oil. At present, automobiles are the main source of nitrogen oxide emissions in urban areas. Nitrogen oxides, at elevated concentrations, can damage the respiratory system. They also can be a key ingredient in the formation of both ozone and acid rain. 
<P>
<B>Sulfur dioxide </B>is released when sulfur-containing fuels like coal and oil are burned. Common sources of sulfur dioxide emissions are electric utilities and certain industrial processes. Sulfur dioxide at elevated concentrations can cause respiratory problems. It also can be a contributing component of acid rain.
<P>
<B>Toxic chemicals such as benzene, toluene and 1,1,1 trichloroethane</B>, when present in the air that we breathe in elevated concentrations over time, can cause various health effects including birth defects, cancer and other health problems. Sources of toxic emissions include industrial processes, such as refineries and chemical manufacturers, small businesses such as printers and dry cleaners and automobiles. 
<P>
<B>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</B> is formed when fuel does not burn completely. Cars and trucks are the main contributors. Carbon monoxide interferes with the blood's ability to transport oxygen to cells and tissues. Exposure to elevated levels of carbon monoxide can cause drowsiness, headaches and sometimes death. Carbon monoxide is particularly hazardous to those who have heart disease or pre-existing lung conditions.
<P>
<B>Lead</B> is a heavy metal that persists in the environment for decades. The former use of leaded gasoline, which is no longer commercially available in most of the United States, the manufacture of lead-based paint and lead-acid battery reclamation operations are sources of lead in the air. Emissions from metal smelters are another source. Exposure to lead at high levels and over time can cause brain and other nervous system damage, particularly in children. Excess exposure to lead can also harm wildlife and is known to cause cancer in animals. 
<P>
<B>Acid Rain</B> forms when the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel-burning plants and other combustion processes combine with rain, fog or snow in the atmosphere. Over time, with conducive geologic conditions, acid rain can increase the acidities of lakes, streams and soils, disturbing or destroying local environments. Wind can carry pollutants far away from where they originated, creating problems in other states or countries.

<H4><A NAME="NATURAL">NATURAL SCIENCE 101</A>
</H4>
<P>
Soil is the material that is formed from rocks and decaying plants and animals; it makes up the outermost layer of the earth. There are at least 70,000 kinds of soil in the United States. Topsoil is considered the most productive soil layer. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, natural processes can take 500 years to form one inch of topsoil.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<H4><A NAME="CROPLAND">CROPLAND EROSION</A></H4>
Though concern for soil erosion in the United States dates back to the days of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the federal government did not take action to address the problem until 1933. The dust storms of the 1930s, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas, resulted in tremendous crop and farm loss and thousands of unemployed farmers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#2">(2)</A> This brought Presidential and Congressional attention to issues of soil erosion. 
<P>
One of the first steps Congress took was to create the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put unemployed men, including farmers, to work planting trees and building erosion control dams. In 1935, the Soil Conservation Service was established within the United States Department of Agriculture and began to work directly with farmers around the country creating soil and water conservation districts. Soil and Water Conservation Districts are political subdivisions of the state, governed by a board of directors elected by resident landowners of the district. Some of the soil erosion correctives recommended in the 1930s included crop rotation, contour plowing, planting tree rows and leaving marginal lands as pasture land. These practices were credited with arresting soil erosion for a time.  
<P>
Texas enacted its own Soil Conservation Laws in 1939, resulting in the establishment of the Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board. The Board coordinates the activities of the local soil and water conservation districts, which numbered 213 in 1994. 
<P>
In the 1970s, an increase in worldwide demand for farm commodities led the U.S. government to create new crop subsidy incentives to persuade farmers to plant "fencerow to fencerow." Farmers eager to increase production put marginal lands into production and discontinued the practice of crop rotation. To combat the depletion of overused soils, farmers had to increase their use of chemical fertilizers. By the mid 1980s, new federal action was needed to confront the problem of soil erosion. The current Food Security Act of 1985 (aka the 1985 Farm Bill) contains two major features, informally called the "sodbuster" programs, that address soil erosion. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers to take highly erodible land out of production for 10 years. The Conservation Compliance Provision (CCP) requires farmers with highly erodible land to implement approved conservation plans by December 31, 1994, to be eligible for any federal farm program benefits.      
<P>
Large scale loss of soil from erosion results in at least two major environmental problems. First, cropland becomes less productive because the soil left after erosion loses its fertility and is unable to supply plants with necessary nutrients. The soil's ability to retain water is also greatly diminished. These changes, in turn, result in higher production costs, including the costs for the increased use of petrochemical-based fertilizers. Second, soil erosion by water causes sedimentation in waterways which threatens aquatic life and hinders the water flow. Soil erosion by water also carries polluting agricultural chemicals into rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. According to a 1989 study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, 350 to 400 million acres of agricultural land are estimated to account for more than 50 percent of suspended sediments deposited in surface waters in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#3">(3)</A>  
<P>
Experts recognize the difficulty in accurately assessing costs of soil erosion, but the USDA has estimated that the offsite costs to society of erosion in the United States are between $2 billion and $8 billion annually, and the direct onsite farm cost is estimated at $1 billion to $18 billion per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#4">(4)</A>  The United States Department of Agriculture, however, has expressed doubts about the reliability of these estimates.

<A NAME="CONDITIONS">CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Of the 32 million acres of cropland in Texas, more than 12.8 million acres or 40 percent are classified as highly erodible.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#5">(5)</A>  With an average loss of 14 tons of soil per acre annually, Texas is one of the eight worst states for soil erosion rates.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#6">(6)</A>    
<P>
Water erosion is the primary concern for the central and eastern parts of Texas. Wind erosion is the primary concern in far west Texas and the High Plains region. Both wind and water are concerns in the Rolling Plains and southern parts of the state.
<P>
The Federal and State agencies that have major responsibility for the well-being of our soil are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>The Consolidated Farm Service Agency, formerly known as the USDA Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Services.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#7">(7)</A> This is the USDA's state-level administrative arm. Since the 1930s, Texas and other states have received federal monies under the Agricultural Conservation Program for direct assistance to producers. Under this program, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency distributes approximately $13 million federal dollars annually to Texas producers to assist them in implementing 15 to 20 best management practices. These practices include terracing, ponds, wells, irrigation and agriculture waste facilities. In 1993, approximately $164,000,000 was distributed to Texas farmers under the Conservation Reserve Program.
	<P>
	<LI>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation Service. This service is responsible for all soil and water conservation programs, the Wetlands Reserve program and other programs related to natural resources conservation. Through a memorandum of understanding with local Soil Conservation Districts, the Service assists agricultural producers, on a voluntary basis, in designing site-specific conservation management plans. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board. This is a state agency with a five member Board elected by delegations from the soil conservation districts. The Board coordinates the activities of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts, develops a statewide conservation plan and is the lead agency for designing site-specific programs to abate non-point source pollution resulting from agriculture and silviculture. In fiscal year 1994, the Board received a state appropriation of $5,200,586. Almost $2 million of this was targeted for the non-point source pollution programs. For fiscal year 1995, the Board was appropriated $7,319,298, of which approximately $4,035,187 is targeted for non-point source pollution programs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#8">(8)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>The Soil and Water Conservation Districts. There are 213 soil conservation districts in Texas. Most districts conform to county boundary lines. Each district has an elected board of directors made up of district landowners. Among other activities, the local Soil Conservation District Board coordinates the technical assistance to producers provided by USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. The districts also prepare long-range soil and water conservation plans for the area.   
	<P>
	<LI>The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, formerly the Texas A&amp;M Extension Service. This Service provides a link between agricultural producers and agricultural research. Through county offices, it provides educational programs and materials to producers, farm workers and homeowners on such subjects as the proper use of agricultural chemicals, new agricultural technology and conservation practices.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Natural resource experts have divided Texas into 11 major land resource areas, based on similar soils, vegetation, climate and land uses. These are often referred to as "ecoregions." 
</UL>
<P>
Soil erosion levels vary among types of soil, and, of course, some erosion is natural and inevitable. The amount of soil erosion that most cropland can tolerate without reducing production is termed by the United States Department of Agriculture the "T" factor. In Texas, the "T" factor for most cropland is about five tons per acre per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#10">(10)</A>  Most Texas cropland can lose five tons of soil a year for an indefinite period of time without production being affected. The objective of conservation practices is to bring erosion down to or below this "T" factor.    
<P>
According to the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, total gross sheet and rill erosion within Texas averages about 229 million tons annually. This is an average annual rate of 1.36 tons per acre. Gross gully and stream erosion averages about 98 million tons annually, or an average rate of 0.58 tons per acre.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
Soil erosion by water is a problem on about 24.3 million acres of Texas cropland and grassland.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#12">(12)</A> Figures are not available on the number of acres on which wind erosion has a large impact.

Note: El Paso represents a special case. The graphic only shows sources from within the El Paso County area, where an estimated 88 tons of NOx and 90 tons of VOCs are released into the atmosphere -  a relatively low amount compared to Texas' other cities. However, El Paso shares the border with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which has a significant influence on air quality in Mexico. A special section later in this chapter - "Sharing Air Along the U.S. -Mexico Border" - will highlight some of these issues.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 7, Texas Energy, Page 1
</H5>
<A NAME="TEXAS">American</A> Indians were the first to utilize Texas' vast energy resources. In addition to the wood they harvested from the state's immense forests, the Lipan Apache, Comanches and Kiowas used dried buffalo dung for heating and cooking. Archaeological records show tribal groups along the coast used naturally occurring tar to seal their baskets. They also used the thick oil that seeped from the ground to put handles on their tools and affix dart points to their arrows. Archaeological sites near Lake Lewisville show the first Texas settlers collected and burned lignite some 8,000 years before the arrival of Europeans.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#1">(1)</A> 
<P>
Coal was the first fossil fuel used by white settlers. Surface supplies were used throughout the early 1800s and mining of coal began in the 1850s. Coal continues to be an integral part of Texas' energy mix. Over the past two decades, the state has produced 652 million tons of soft coal (also called lignite), the equivalent of 1.5 billion barrels of oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#2">(2)</A> Texas is the sixth largest producer of coal in the U.S. and the state has only begun to mine this vast resource. More than 24 billion tons of lignite still lie beneath the surface. 
<P>
Since the state's first big oil discovery at Spindletop in 1901, Texas has produced 54 billion barrels of oil, providing trillions of dollars in tax revenues to state government and thousands of jobs to residents. Texas oil was a critical ingredient in the Allied war effort in World War II. The "Big Inch" and "Little Big Inch" pipelines carried much-needed Texas petroleum to industrial facilities on the East Coast. From there, Texas oil was shipped to Europe for use by Allied forces. 
<P>
The Texas energy industry has survived periods of boom and bust. In 1929, Texas was the biggest oil-producing province in the world. By 1930, high-grade oil was selling for $1.10 per barrel (42 gallons). But the following year, the market fell apart. The huge East Texas Field near Kilgore began producing a million barrels of oil per day, far more than the market could absorb. Prices plummeted and Texas oil was selling for just 10 cents a barrel.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#3">(3)</A> The problems of oversupply and disarray in the market forced the state to take action, and in 1932, the state legislature authorized the Railroad Commission of Texas to limit oil production.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#4">(4)</A> By setting limits on the amount of oil that each field could produce, the Commission was able to prevent floods of oil from coming onto the market. But the Railroad Commission has not been able to insulate the industry from price upheavals. Another boom in the early 1980s caused a surge in oil drilling, which fell apart four years later. 
<P>
The 1980s were not kind to the oil industry. Nationwide, nearly half a million Americans lost jobs in the oil industry. More jobs were lost in the energy business than in the steel and auto industries combined. In Texas, between 1981 and 1992, 24 refineries closed, the number of active drilling rigs declined from 1,300 to 209 and 160,000 Texans lost jobs in the oil and gas sector.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#5">(5)</A> In 1981, the oil and gas industry accounted for 25 percent of the gross state product. By 1993, it had fallen by more than half, to 12 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#6">(6)</A> By the year 2015, oil and gas is expected to account for less than 8 percent of the gross state product.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#7">(7)</A> 
<P>
State tax revenues from oil have also fallen. During the 1950s the state routinely got a third of its tax revenue from oil and gas taxes. Today, the state gets less than 7 percent of total revenues from oil and gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#8">(8)</A>
<P>
With 17 million residents, Texas has about 7 percent of the U.S. population, but in 1989, the state accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total energy usage. Texas consumes more electricity, natural gas, coal and petroleum than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#9">(9)</A> 
<P>
Today, the Texas energy industry is at a cross- roads. Oil production in the state is falling. Natural gas consumption is increasing but reserves are shrinking. Coal use has risen sharply. For the first time, Texas faces the prospect of becoming a net energy importer. The state whose vast oil resources once played a critical role in national defense may soon be dependent on other states and foreign countries to meet demand.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#10">(10)</A> 
<P>
Much of the state's energy demand comes from its huge appetite for electricity. Electricity demand in the state is now growing at about 2.5 percent per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#11">(11)</A> More than half the new electricity coming on-line will be generated by coal-fired power plants, with one-third of the coal coming from Wyoming.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
<P>
Nuclear power is meeting some of the demand for electricity. The state now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear generating capacity. Texas was once a dominant producer of uranium, the element that provides fuel for the nuclear energy industry. However, the market for uranium has gone soft and most of Texas' uranium mining sites are now dormant.
<P>
Harnessing the hot Texas sun and corralling the swift Texas breeze could allow the state to get much of its energy from non-polluting, renewable sources. Solar power could also supply much of the state's electricity. Studies have shown that one sunny acre of land in West Texas could produce the energy equivalent of 800 barrels of oil per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#13">(13)</A> If Texas captured all of its wind resources, it could supply 10 percent of electricity needs of the contiguous United States.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#14">(14)</A> In Texas, the wind alone could generate 136,000 megawatts of electricity, or more than twice the state's installed generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<P>
Despite the promise of wind, solar, biomass and other renewable technologies, large amounts of capital and significant changes in government policies will be needed to develop those resources. In the meantime, the state will have to increase efficiency or meet new electricity demand through conventional sources, such as coal, oil or natural gas, or through the construction of new nuclear plants. 
<P>
Much of the demand for electricity could be reduced through conservation and improved efficiency of engines, motors, refrigerators, air conditioners, lights and other products. However, large electricity producers are not spending much money on efficiency improvements. The state's largest utilities are spending just $40 million per year on programs to increase electrical efficiency.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#16">(16)</A> For comparison, Texans spent $14 billion on electricity purchases in 1991. In other words, Texas utilities spent just .003 percent of their total income on energy efficiency programs. 
<P>
Some estimates show that conservation alone could reduce demand for electricity in the state by one-third. By one estimate, if Texas utilities adopted an aggressive conservation policy, consumers could be saving up to $2.5 billion annually by the year 2010. While consumers would save money on their power bills, utilities could avoid spending some $8.4 billion for new power plants and infrastructure.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#20">(20)</A>
<P>
Energy efficiency and renewable energy resources will play critical roles in Texas' energy mix as the state heads into the 21st century. The state must soon address the need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in order to meet the goals of the Global Climate Change Treaty. Signed by the U.S. and a host of other nations, the treaty requires signatories to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels. As the country's largest energy consuming state, Texas leads the nation in production of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming. The global warming issue and the 1990 Clean Air Act, which requires businesses in the state to reduce their sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions (see Air Section), could force Texas to change its energy consumption patterns.
<P>
Over the next few decades, Texas will also see increased energy trade with Mexico. Even before the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Texas was sending huge amounts of energy to its southern neighbor. In northern Mexico, where rapid industrialization has led to increasing demand for natural gas and electricity, natural gas (mainly from Texas fields) is fueling growth. In 1988, Mexico bought 2.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas from the U.S. By 1991, that figure jumped to 91 Bcf. By the year 2000, it has been predicted that Mexico will buy 300 Bcf of American gas per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#21">(21)</A> 
<P>
Texas may also start selling electricity to its neighbor. Since 1972, electric power consumption in Mexico has more than tripled and over the next decade, demand for electricity is expected to double.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#22">(22)</A>

<TR><TH>PER CAPITA WATER USE BY MUNICIPALITY</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Municipal water use is the fastest growing category of water use in Texas, and is projected to meet or exceed the volumes used in every other category by 2040. Municipal water use includes water for households and businesses, restaurants and public offices, sanitation and landscaping and fire protection. Generally, the largest cities in the state use the most water, with Houston and Dallas consuming 12 percent and 9 percent of all municipal water. However, even accounting for a city's overall size, per capita use varies widely across the state, with cities like Dallas and Amarillo using significantly more water per capita than Houston or San Antonio. Average per capita municipal use was about 100 gallons per day in the 1950s and rose to a high of 182 gallons per day in 1978. Since that time, per capita use in the state has begun to decline, leveling off to an estimated 167 gallons per capita per day in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#45">(45)</A>
<P>
However, it is important to note that for planning purposes and projecting water demand, the "dry" year use average - whenever in the last 10 years the most water was used, usually in the dryest year - is used, not whatever the latest year's average is. For example, while Houston's average gallons per capita per day in 1993 was 159, for water supply purposes, the dry year figure of 189 gallons per capita per day - which occured during 1986 - is used as a base, and then adjusted for conservation. Similarly, while Austin's average gallons per capita per day is 180, the dry year gallons per capita per day used for determining future demand is 221 (occurring in 1984).
<P>
Since 1986, the Texas Water Development Board has helped promote water conservation by requiring recipients of federal and state water and wastewater loans of more than $500,000 to implement a water conservation program. To date, 165 loan recipients, including the city of Houston, have been required to adopt water conservation programs. In addition, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has recently instituted rules that require the adoption of water conservation measures as a condition of receiving a permit to use state water.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#46">(46)</A>

<A name="ESTIMATING">ESTIMATING THE SUPPLY OF WATER</A>
</H4>
<P>
Can Texas meet all of these demands? Supply projections include return flows of treated wastewater as well as new surface water supplies generated by new conveyance systems and reservoirs (see graphic). They also account for the reuse of water by both industry and individuals, which reduces demand, thereby increasing available supply. The Texas Water Development Board projects that these supplies will meet expected demand. However, the chart shows that by 2040 demand projections from the 1990 Water Plan will nearly equal supply. 
<P>
However, these projections do not take into account fully the amount of water that may be needed to maintain adequate aquatic and wildlife habitats. The 1996 Consensus Water Plan being developed is seeking to incorporate these environmental needs into the projections of supply and demand. Numbers for the projected supply of water are being developed as part of the 1996 Consensus Water Plan. 
<P>
An assumption made in the Texas Water Development Board's 1990 water plan is that the sustainable yield from groundwater and surface water is about 17 million acre-feet per year. In fact, there is considerable debate about how much water is actually available. Some environmental groups believe the supply is much higher. The Texas Committee on Natural Resources, for example, argues that the figure is closer to 25 million acre-feet in non-drought years when run-of-the-river flows are considered along with what is available in the reservoirs themselves.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#54">(54)</A> If actual demand is lower than projected, or actual supply higher, the Board's plans could overstate the need to develop new water supply facilities, such as reservoirs. 
<P>
Even though the overall supply is expected to be sufficient to meet demand statewide, there are major areas - including San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, El Paso and, perhaps, Austin - where this may not be the case. See the Regional Demand and Supply section for a full discussion of each of these areas.

<TR><TH>ENVIRONMENTAL USE</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Increasingly, maintaining the natural habitats of plants and animals is recognized as a beneficial use of water. Perhaps the single biggest policy issue related to the use of water for habitat is the question of the appropriate amount of fresh water needed to maintain the state's bays and estuaries. Estuaries serve as important spawning grounds for many species of marine life. The state's 2.6 million acres of coastal habitat, which include bays, estuaries, and wetlands, are also home to a variety of migratory birds. These estuaries and their adjacent wetlands depend greatly upon the inflow of fresh water from rivers and streams. As river water winds its way down to the Gulf and is used and reused for industry, irrigation and municipalities, both its quality and quantity are altered, affecting bays and estuaries.
<P>
Estimating the amount of fresh water needed for in-stream habitat viability is problematic. There is considerable controversy, for example, about whether the federal government's in-stream flow methodology, which was developed using cold, mountainous Western rivers as models, can be applied to Texas' slow, meandering warm water streams.
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department uses a modified form of this methodology to determine in-stream flows that should be maintained in different streams to protect aquatic life and habitat. Parks and Wildlife favors the federal government's methodology, known as the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) in part because it is designed to protect riffle areas. Riffle areas are the highest points in the riverbed, which tend to be where rivers run fastest and where the invertebrates and other species inhabiting the river reach their highest populations. These riffle areas are favored by some species for their spawning habitat. The Texas Water Development Board, however, favors another methodology - the Microhabitat Assessment Technique - which is designed to protect the deep pools of the river.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#55">(55)</A>
<P>
Equally problematic is determining the inflow needs of bays and estuaries, since they depend upon these stream inflows. An estuary occurs where a river meets the sea and fresh and salt water mix. The estuary and its adjacent wetlands - coastal vegetative areas with inundated or saturated soils - provide important biological spawning grounds for marine life. They also furnish habitat for aquatic species and migratory fowl. 
<P>
Estuaries, bays and related aquatic habitats contribute significantly to the state's economy. They aid navigation and provide a base for recreational and commercial fishing and boating. An estimated 1 million recreational fishermen and 20,000 commercial fishermen fish Texas' coastal waters each year, for an estimated economic impact of $2.9 billion.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, preserving these wetlands and estuarine systems helps ensure water quality since they act as a natural filtering system for many pollutants.
<P>
At present, and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department - in conjunction with the Texas Water Development Board and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission - has developed estimates of the quantities of fresh water needed to protect San Antonio Bay. Estimates for Galveston Bay and Sabine Bay are expected in late 1995, and Texas Parks and Wildlife officials expect to have a methodology and estimate for Corpus Christi Bay by 1997.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#57">(57)</A>
<P>
Since 1985, all new surface water use permits and all amendments to existing use permits may contain provisions to reserve water for public purposes. Water right holders are required to limit their diversion of water from rivers and streams when stream flows are below a certain level. Before 1985, however, no such diversion was explicitly required. Thus, water rights for rivers like the Rio Grande have been fully appropriated without reserving any water for environmental and public purposes. Since 1986, the state has required new reservoirs that are within 200 miles of the coast to dedicate at least 5 per-cent of their firm yield for in-stream needs of aquatic habitat and the inflow needs of the bays and estuaries. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department may help determine the appropriate amount. Proposals to construct reservoirs or dam rivers require both a state and federal permit, and the federal permit process also requires applicants to consider effects upon streamflow and habitat.

Assuring a safe, adequate supply of water for irrigation, for industrial and municipal needs and for the environmental needs of individual rivers, bays and estuaries is largely a regional question. Most projections show that Texas has enough water in the state as a whole, but each region in the state has different water resources, has differing needs and faces different problems. This section looks at eight major regions in Texas, and highlights the expected demands, supplies and problems in each of them.

<UL>
	<IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  The longest river in Texas? The Rio Grande, which begins in Colorado and covers 1,896 miles, second only to the Missouri-Mississippi.
	<P>
	The second longest? The Red River, which forms the border between Texas and Oklahoma.
	<P>
	The shortest river? The Comal, only two-and-a-half miles long.
	<P>
	What's the biggest aquifer? The Ogallala Aquifer, which covers four states, and in 1974 had more than 281.7 million acre-feet of recoverable groundwater. By 2031, this total will have been reduced to 76.1 million acre-feet in Texas.

<LI>The Edwards Aquifer - the sole source of water for San Antonio's one million people - is also essential to provide stream inflow to the Leona, San Pedro, San Antonio, Hueco, Comal and San Marcos Springs north of San Antonio, as well as to Barton Springs in the Austin area. Continued use of the Edwards Aquifer is threatening these streams' ecosystems, curtailing the recreational opportunities they have long afforded. The Sierra Club, a national environmental group, is currently suing the city of San Antonio in federal district court to limit pumpage to protect Comal and San Marcos Springs, which are home to several endangered species. The judge ordered the city to prepare an emergency withdrawal reduction plan in 1994 to limit pumpage from the Edwards Aquifer in order to assure protection of the Texas Blind Salamander and the San Marcos Salamander, among other species. 
<P>
<LI>Overpumping of Edwards Aquifer will eventually lead to encroachment of saline water in some areas. Naturally occurring hydrogen sulfide continues to be a costly problem because it must be removed before water can be used for drinking. 
<P>
<LI>Pumping from the Carrizo Aquifer in the Winter Gardens area has lowered water levels 400 feet, causing encroachment of poor quality water into the aquifer.
<P>
<LI>The Texas Hill Country west of Austin and north of San Antonio suffer from groundwater supply problems because of declining water levels and poor water quality. For example, the communities of Fredericksburg, Johnson City, Kerrville and other cities in the area have begun using surface water to supplement their groundwater use. Groundwater tends to be high in salts and other minerals.
<P>
<li>If current water usage patterns continue, the city of Austin, which relies on surface water supplies, will face water shortages within 50 years.

<LI>The pumping of the Gulf Coast Aquifer has caused subsidence, and has allowed salt water encroachment from the bays. The Harris-Galveston Coastal Subsidence District regulates the amount of groundwater removed from the Gulf Coast Aquifer in the Houston/Galveston area and is developing a conversion plan to convert areas from groundwater to surface water by 2010. The Brazos River Authority is developing the Allen's Creek Reservoir to meet new demand for surface water.
<P>
<LI>Bays and estuaries require significant amounts of inflow to protect habitats and economic survival, but inflows will decline as population grows. New reservoirs proposed for the coastal area to increase the supplies along the major river basins will impact estuary and bay habitat.

<LI>The Texas Water Development Board projects that the city of Corpus Christi will be unable to meet its water needs from Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir by 2010. Although the two reservoirs could provide the city an estimated 220,000 acre-feet per year, environmental releases required by the state to protect the needs of downstream habitat will reduce available supplies by 30,000 acre-feet per year. Further, recreational users want to maintain high water levels for boating purposes.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
<LI>Brownsville and Harlingen in Cameron County will exceed their permitted rights to surface water by 2010 and will need to purchase additional water rights, probably as agricultural land is converted to suburban use.

In Hidalgo County alone, there are an estimated 130,000 residents living without proper wastewater facilities.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#61">(61)</A> The preponderance of improperly built septic tanks and drainage fields is affecting the quality of water in the region as a whole.

<LI>The Edwards Aquifer - the sole source of water for San Antonio's one million people - is also essential to provide stream inflow to the Leona, San Pedro, San Antonio, Hueco, Comal and San Marcos Springs north of San Antonio, as well as to Barton Springs in the Austin area. Continued use of the Edwards Aquifer is threatening these streams' ecosystems, curtailing the recreational opportunities they have long afforded. The Sierra Club, a national environmental group, is currently suing the city of San Antonio in federal district court to limit pumpage to protect Comal and San Marcos Springs, which are home to several endangered species. The judge ordered the city to prepare an emergency withdrawal reduction plan in 1994 to limit pumpage from the Edwards Aquifer in order to assure protection of the Texas Blind Salamander and the San Marcos Salamander, among other species. 
<P>
<LI>Overpumping of Edwards Aquifer will eventually lead to encroachment of saline water in some areas. Naturally occurring hydrogen sulfide continues to be a costly problem because it must be removed before water can be used for drinking. 
<P>
<LI>Pumping from the Carrizo Aquifer in the Winter Gardens area has lowered water levels 400 feet, causing encroachment of poor quality water into the aquifer.
<P>
<LI>The Texas Hill Country west of Austin and north of San Antonio suffer from groundwater supply problems because of declining water levels and poor water quality. For example, the communities of Fredericksburg, Johnson City, Kerrville and other cities in the area have begun using surface water to supplement their groundwater use. Groundwater tends to be high in salts and other minerals.
<P>
<li>If current water usage patterns continue, the city of Austin, which relies on surface water supplies, will face water shortages within 50 years.

<TR><TD>
While Texas has no state-level stormwater permitting program, municipal and industrial wastewater permits may include requirements to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff. In 1991, for example, 439 of 966 industrial permits regulated stormwater discharges from industry.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#62">(62)</A> 
<P>Because the federal government has not delegated to Texas responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, federal stormwater permits are issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act required that stormwater discharges be permitted in two phases. Phase 1, which has been completed across the nation, required all pre-1987 dischargers as well as industries, construction projects covering more than five acres, and cities of more than 100,000 population with a separate stormwater sewer system to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Under Phase II, which began October 1, 1994, most other stormwater dischargers, including cities of less than 100,000 population and businesses such as commercial and retail outlets may be required to obtain an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.

<A NAME="POLLUTION">WHERE POLLUTION</A> OCCURS IN TEXAS
</H4>
<P>The state has ranked its rivers, streams, reservoirs and bays in terms of severity of pollution. The ranking system was based in part on how well the water body met traditional water-quality parameters (bacteria, chlorides, dissolved oxygen content, temperature, etc.), and in part on such criteria as reported fish kills, known municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, extent of non-point-source pollution, known toxicity problems and other information.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#64">(64)</A> The most polluted rivers are concentrated in southeast and central south Texas. The most polluted reservoirs and lakes are mainly in central and eastern Texas.

<H4><A NAME="AUTHORITIES">RIVER AUTHORITIES</A> LOOK AT WATER QUALITY
</H4>
<P>Under a 1991 state law, local river authorities and coastal basin authorities are required to assess their river basins every two years, identifying major water quality issues. In 1992, all river authorities identified the lack of monitoring, and the resulting limited water-quality data, as the major water quality issue.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>For a number of river authorities, a high level of fecal coliform bacteria was identified as a major water quality problem. Water quality standards for fecal coliform are designed to prevent human illness since they are an indicator of other pathogens that cause infectious diseases like hepatitis and cholera. High fecal coliform levels were found in 20 of the 23 coastal and river basins and 49 percent of all classified segments. The high levels in the coastal areas have led to the closing of oyster harvesting areas. 
<P>Other river authorities identified toxics as a major concern. Many toxic chemicals, including pesticides, solvents and other organics and inorganic chemicals and metals have been linked to birth defects, cancer and other diseases. Specific toxic materials identified by river authorities, based on limited monitoring data, include pesticides like Aldrin, and PCBs, banned for new uses. Most toxicity problems pinpointed by the river basin assessments relate to high levels of nickel, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, which probably are from industrial sources. In about 23 percent of the reported cases of fish kills over the last four years, toxic pollutants were the cause.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#66">(66)</A> In two water bodies, the Rio Grande downstream of Laredo/Nuevo Laredo, and the Alligator Bayou in the Neches-Trinity coastal river basin, unusually high numbers of fish abnormalities indicate problems with toxic pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>Fourteen of the river authorities identified low oxygen levels as a major water quality concern. This condition, also referred to as high biological oxygen demand (BOD), is considered one of the most obvious indicators of degraded water quality because it directly impacts aquatic life. It may result from high nutrient levels, urban runoff, or excessive organic loading from wastewater discharges. 
<P>Eight river authorities identified high levels of nutrients - usually phosphorus, nitrogen ammonia and nitrates - as a major water quality issue. Wastewater discharges, improperly functioning wastewater systems, septic tanks, agricultural run-off and other kinds of non-point-source pollution were identified as probable sources of these nutrient loadings. While excess plant nutrients pose no direct threat to human health, they do lead to excess vegetation which can choke off rivers and lakes and eventually reduce dissolved oxygen, affecting fish and other aquatic species. 
<P>Three coastal-area river authorities listed degradation of habitat as a major water quality concern. Development, erosion and the dredging and filling of coastal areas have destroyed some animal habitat in rivers and streams. The result has been a reduction in biodiversity in the area.
<P>In addition to these water quality problems identified by river authorities, excessive levels of toxics such as metals and pesticides in edible fish tissue has led the Texas Department of Health to issue total bans on consumption of fish and shellfish in four river segments, one entire reservoir and two bay segments (see "Coastal Water" <I>s</I>ection for details). The Texas Department of Health has issued fish consumption advisories in 14 other water bodies.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#72">(72)</A> 
<P>Fishing in areas that have been closed to fishing and keeping those fish is a violation of state law. Most recently, following the discovery of fish contaminated with high levels of PCBs, the Department of Health declared the Donna Reservoir and Irrigation Canal closed to fishing.

<TR><TH>FISHING FOR PCBs?</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Like most states, Texas has no comprehensive fish monitoring program. The state does test fish tissue for contaminants when a report of a chemical <BR>
spill or some other information leads state health officials to believe human health may be threatened. But no systematic monitoring is done in the absence of these reports. Testing fish is expensive; a detailed tissue sampling of one fish might cost $500 and a full scan, which examines the liver and reproductive organs to pinpoint sources of dangerous contaminants, might exceed $1,000 per sample.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#68">(68)</A> 
<P>The Texas Department of Health's Shellfish Control Division is charged with surveillance of miles of oyster-harvesting areas along the Gulf Coast and has the authority to close bays and estuaries. This program is funded in part by a $1-per-sack fee paid by oyster fishermen. But no comparable revenue source is available for testing inland fish.
<P>Yet there is evidence that such monitoring is warranted. In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a study on the types of environmental problems to which Texas families living along the border are exposed. As part of the study, EPA tested a carp caught by a Brownsville family from the Donna Reservoir. The tests of the fish's tissue revealed PCB levels of 400 parts per million, or 200 times the recommended limit for human consumption.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#69">(69)</A> When further tests of Donna Reservoir fish identified eight more fish contaminated by PCB, the Texas Department of Health issued a fish consumption advisory for the reservoir and its connecting canals. Ten more PCB-contaminated fish caught from an irrigation canal between the reservoir and the Rio Grande River were found in January 1994. Following this study, Texas Department of Health banned any taking or consumption of fish in the area.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#70">(70)</A> 
<P>PCBs have been banned in the U.S. since the late 1970s because they cause liver disorders and developmental delays in infants. (The only exception is for use in electrical transformers.) To date, officials have been unable to identify the source of the PCBs found in the Donna area. 
<P>While startling, the problems at Donna with PCBs are not unique. Over the last ten years, Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission officials have also identified nine segments around the state where concentrations of PCBs in whole fish tissue has been above concern levels.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#71">(71)</A>

<H3><A NAME="GROUNDWATER">GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS</A></H3>
<H4>
<A NAME="BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>
</H4>
<P>
Like surface water, groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from a variety of sources. In Texas, all nine major aquifers and 20 minor aquifers have experienced some form of contamination. These contamination problems stem partly from development and industry and partly from overpumping, which causes infiltration of saline waters. 
<P>
Despite these contamination problems, state laws do not protect groundwater to the extent that they do surface water. There are, for example, no groundwater quality standards to parallel those for surface water. The state does have standards in place for groundwater stored for drinking water, but apart from these public health standards, state law does not apply environmental standards to groundwater. 
<P>
Clean groundwater is needed for more than drinking purposes. Agriculture depends heavily on groundwater for irrigation; in 1990, some 79 percent of all groundwater pumped was used for crop irrigation.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#73">(73)</A> Poor or contaminated groundwater could jeopardize crops and threaten the health of livestock. 
<P>
Clean groundwater is also essential to clean surface water. Groundwater is connected to surface water in the hydrological cycle and some aquifers actually feed area springs and rivers. For example, the Edwards Aquifer is the major source for Central Texas rivers through the Comal and San Marcos Springs. Poor quality water - or a lack of water - harms the springs and their aquatic life as well as downstream users. 
<P>
Sometimes contamination occurs naturally. Saline water from deeper aquifers may reach aquifers that provide water for humans. Some groundwater may have naturally high background levels of nitrates, metals, iron, sulfate or chloride, all of which can give water an odd odor, color or taste. 
<P>
Groundwater contamination has become a major public policy concern in recent decades, as citizens and public officials alike have learned how human activity has impacted water quality. Landfills for both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, improperly completed or abandoned water wells, oil- and gas-related wells, petroleum storage tanks, agricultural pesticides and leaking septic tanks are all potential sources for contaminants that can seep down to the aquifer. Deep petroleum, mining and injection wells can likewise directly pollute aquifers.

<H4>TYPICAL ROUTES OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION</H4>

<H4>
<A NAME="SOURCES">SOURCES OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
It is difficult to ascertain how much groundwater contamination has resulted from human activities. The state does, however, track instances of contamination. The Texas Groundwater Protection Committee, which includes three state agencies that regulate activities that can cause groundwater contamination - the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the Railroad Commission of Texas and the Texas Department of Agriculture - reported 5,670 instances of groundwater contamination between 1989 and 1993 which had yet to be cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#74">(74)</A> These figures represent only the cases reported and confirmed. 
<P>
Although the state conducts no comprehensive water quality assessment for aquifers, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has ranked the aquifers' vulnerability to contamination using a model known as the DRASTIC index. This index looks at both hydrological and geological components of the aquifers to gauge the potential for groundwater pollution. 
<P>
<A NAME="UNDERGROUND"><B>Underground Storage Tanks</A></B>
<P>
From 1989 through 1993, the source of groundwater contamination in 85 percent of the reported cases to the Texas Groundwater Protection Committee was an underground or above ground storage tank. Usually these were petroleum storage tanks used by gas stations. To date, 825 of the 5,718 documented cases (about 15 percent) have been successfully cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#75">(75)</A> 
<P>
There are some 150,000 underground and 17,000 above ground storage tanks registered with the TNRCC. Most contain petroleum products like diesel fuel, waste oil and gasoline. A smaller number store regulated hazardous substances. Of the 5,718 cases of groundwater contamination reported since the state began monitoring the tanks in 1989, about a third are located in the Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas (see <I>County Indicators</I> for a complete list). <A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
In 1989, the Texas Legislature created a fee-supported reimbursement fund that enables the state to assume clean-up costs when the party responsible for contamination is unwilling or unable to pay or cannot be located. From 1990 to 1993, almost $200 million from this fund was spent on petroleum storage tank clean-up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#77">(77)</A> However, fee revenue has not been sufficient to pay for all the necessary clean-ups and the Legislature has had to appropriate emergency funds. Contamination from petroleum storage tanks has affected not only groundwater quality but also real estate values in some areas, as prospective buyers have considered clean-up costs and pollution liability.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#78">(78)</A>

</CENTER><P>

<A NAME="INJECTION"><B>Injection Wells</A></B>
<P>
Injection wells, where pressurized liquid waste or other fluids are injected into aquifers, are a major method of disposal for industrial and hazardous waste. Injection wells are also used to help recover oil, gas and minerals. For example, injection wells are used to inject fresh water into an underground oil field for secondary recovery of oil. Uranium and sulfur are often mined by injecting hot water into formations to loosen up these materials. 
<P>
Injection wells are not a new technology. Beginning in the 1920s, deep wells were injected with superheated water to recover liquid sulfur. As far back as 1938, salt water extracted from the ground along with oil from an East Texas oil field was returned to the lower part of the formation via an injection well.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Injection wells have been involved in a number of controversial lawsuits and permit battles, as well as high-profile groundwater contamination cases, usually resulting from improper handling of the waste at the surface prior to injection (see <I>Waste </I>chapter ). According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, there have been no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination from the injection of hazardous and other industrial waste in the last five years. However, in the case of injection wells used for mining, the movement of mining fluids into groundwater is not considered a case of groundwater contamination so long as the facility cleans up the water and assures that it does not spread past the mining area. All groundwater contamination resulting from these activities has been cleaned up. 
<P>
In Texas, 116 underground injection wells are currently used by generators of hazardous and non-hazardous waste or by owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities. Approximately 65 other wells are in various stages of permitting by the Texas Natural Resource Conser- vation Commission or have stopped operations.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#80">(80)</A> Together, Texas' industries injected approximately 14.8 million tons of hazardous waste on-site, and sent an additional 183,900 tons to Texas commercial facilities in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#81">(81)</A>

<UL><IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  It is estimated that from 1961 through 1981, more than 60 billion gallons of industrial waste have been disposed of in underground injection wells in Texas. <P><I>Source: Texas Department of Water Resources,</I> Underground Injection Operations in Texas<I>, 3-11.</UL></I>
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas has jurisdiction over injection wells used to inject oil and gas waste, a term that includes all waste incidental to drilling for production of oil, gas or geothermal resources. Most waste consist of saltwater, which is recovered along with natural gas during drilling. The Railroad Commission can also issue permits for wells to be used for secondary recovery or to store hydrocarbons. Some 12,475 salt-water disposal wells, 40,000 secondary-recovery wells and 545 hydrocarbon and gas storage wells are currently under the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#82">(82)</A> In 1993, two cases of groundwater contamination related to Railroad Commission-permitted injection wells were documented in Runnels and Matagorda counties.
<P>
Another class of injection wells are those used for uranium or sulfur mining or for the recovery of brine (subsurface salt deposits). These wells can contribute to the contamination of groundwater by increasing its salinity.
<P>
Most of the 81 brine-mining facilities operating in Texas are located in the High Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Thirty-four uranium mining sites, three sodium sulfate mining sites and six sulfur mining sites have been permitted in South Central Texas, near San Antonio. All of the uranium mines and 75 of the 81 brine mines are required to sample and monitor groundwater quarterly because of potential contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#83">(83)</A> In general, injection wells used in mining are not as deep as those used for injection of waste. They are thus more likely to impact near-surface water used for drinking. 
<P>
Other types of wells used in Texas include wells to inject urban or agricultural runoff that has been stored in surface ponds; water used in air conditioning systems; human waste from septic tanks; and fresh surface water or treated wastewater to recharge depleted aquifers. 
<P>
The Lower Rio Grande Valley is the major area of Texas where agricultural drainage wells are used. These wells help eliminate excess water from agricultural production. Because this part of the state is flat and has clay soils and high water tables, there is limited surface drainage. Agricultural drainage wells collect near-surface waters and drain them into subsurface formations. They dispose of waters containing nitrates, dissolved solids and pesticides, all of which have a high potential for contamination of groundwater. 
<P>
These wells are used mainly in citrus production, which has been rapidly declining in the Valley.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#84">(84)</A> Some 108 wells have been located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley counties of Hidalgo and Starr and in south-central Runnels County. Other agricultural drainage wells are located in Oldham County, where they could impact the Ogallala Aquifer.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#85">(85)</A>
<P>
<A NAME="OTHERWELLS"><B>Other Wells</B></A>
<P>
Groundwater may also be affected by the thousands of Texas wells drilled for water or for oil and gas exploration. When improperly drilled or cased, or when the casing has corroded, old oil, gas, and water wells serve as conduits for contamination of the aquifers below. Improperly completed and abandoned water wells may allow direct access from the surface to groundwater for contaminants such as pesticides, or they may facilitate the comingling of groundwater from one aquifer to another. Additionally, they can be a safety hazard to humans and livestock.
<P>
There are an estimated 600,000 individual water wells in Texas, of which 150,000 are conservatively estimated to be abandoned.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#86">(86)</A> The Texas Water Development Board estimates that about 20,000 new wells are drilled each year, most of which are not properly inventoried.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#87">(87)</A> Currently, all new wells must meet specific casing and construction standards and abandoned wells must be plugged. This plugging activity is overseen by the Water Well Drillers Team, since 1993 a division of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. About 150 wells per month are plugged by individual landowners and reported to the Water Well Drillers Team.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#88">(88)</A> However, abandoned water wells are considered one of the greatest sources of pollution of groundwater within Texas and may rank first in priority for mitigation by the state.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#89">(89)</A>
<P>
In addition to water wells, an estimated 1.5 million holes have been drilled in this century for oil- and gas-related activities. About 1 million of these remain improperly plugged.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#90">(90)</A> Abandoned oil wells are channels for the upward movement of brine - saltwater often found in oil-bearing zones - and paths to contamination by oil and gas, drilling fluids and other contaminants. Salt water from abandoned oil wells has contributed to pollution in the upper portions of the Colorado River.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#91">(91)</A> These wells must be plugged to prevent the contamination of aquifers by salt water and oil waste. 
<P>
The Railroad Commission of Texas has regulated the oil industry since 1901 when pipelines were designated as a form of interstate transport on a par with railroads. Currently, 367,188 oil and gas wells across the state are registered with the Railroad Commission, about 86,000 of which are not currently producing.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#92">(92)</A> Some 30,210 of these wells may need to be plugged in the coming years to prevent contamination of aquifers. 
<P>
To address the large number of unplugged wells, the Texas Legislature in 1984 created an Abandoned Well Plugging Fund, which has spent $54 million and has helped plug approximately 7,500 wells over the past ten years.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#93">(93)</A>
<P>
<A NAME="OTHEROIL"><B>Other Oil and Gas Industry Impacts</A></B>
<P>
The EPA estimates that about one million tons of hazardous waste is produced each year in American oil fields.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#94">(94)</A> The disposal of this waste has the potential to affect groundwater. Until 1969, when the Railroad Commission adopted its no pit rule - also known as Statewide Rule 8 - oil companies typically disposed of salt water and chemicals in open pits, creeks and roads. The chemicals used during the oil-well drilling process and disposed of in these pits include such highly toxic elements as barium, arsenic and cadmium. 
<P>
Today, the storage and disposal of major oil and gas waste requires a permit or authorization. Statewide Rule 8 identifies three types of oil field pits: prohibited pits, authorized pits and authorized pits through a permit. Authorized activities include land farming, where toxic materials are mixed with soils; burial; road-spreading; commercial hauling, treatment and disposal; and the use of pits such as reserve pits, fresh mining water pits and others. Other pits such as saltwater disposal pits, brine pits, drilling fluid storage and disposal pits, and gas plant evaporation and retention pits require a permit from the Railroad Commission.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#95">(95)</A> There are currently 76 land farming facilities permitted for disposal of oil and gas waste and 4,979 lined pits permitted for storage or disposal of such waste.
<P>
In 1993, the Railroad Commission reported 20 new cases of groundwater contamination due to hydrocarbons, crude oil, chlorides and hydrochloric acid. These cases added to the 44 cases from previous years which had not yet been cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#96">(96)</A> Contamination from oil and gas activities may in fact be higher; the Railroad Commission monitors only 75 groundwater monitoring wells associated with 53 disposal sites out of more than 5,000 permitted sites.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#97">(97)</A>

<A NAME="HAZARDOUS"><B>Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
Another serious threat to groundwater in Texas comes from abandoned hazardous waste sites. Many of these sites are regulated through the federal Superfund program, which designates abandoned hazardous waste sites for clean-up by placing them on a National Priorities List. States may also designate hazardous waste sites on a state Superfund list. Texas now has 30 federally designated Superfund sites on the National Priorities List, and 42 sites proposed or listed on the state Superfund registry (See <I>Waste </I>section for more detail). All of these sites are subject to groundwater monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Seven sites on the federal Superfund list, and eight on the state Superfund list are directly related to the production of oil and gas. Twenty-five of the federally designated sites and 13 of the state sites show contamination of groundwater by such constituents as arsenic, lead, chromium and PCBs. 
<P>
In addition to these Superfund sites, industrial and municipal hazardous-waste disposal facilities have been responsible for 456 cases of groundwater contamination in Texas between 1989 and 1993, none of which has yet been cleaned up.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#98">(98)</A> Another 38 abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites not designated as Superfund sites by either the state or the federal government have been the source of confirmed groundwater contamination. Municipal solid waste facilities have been linked with another 24 cases of contamination. Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites and municipal landfills are discussed more fully in the section entitled <I>Waste. </I>
<P>
<A NAME="AGRICULTURE"><B>Agriculture</A></B>
<P>
As they have degraded surface water, agricultural and forestry activities have also degraded groundwater quality in Texas. Unauthorized discharges and runoff from Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) have been responsible for nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater. (However, excess nitrate in groundwater can be caused by other sources, such as poorly designed or old septic tanks.) The primary causes of agriculture-related groundwater contamination are runoff from Confined Animal Feeding Operations, pastures and barnyards; excessive nitrogen fertilization of crop land; and land-clearing and other agricultural practices which change soil composition, altering its ability to filter out pollutants. 
<P>
Agricultural chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides are also a major concern for groundwater protection. From 1987 to 1990, the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA), which regulates pesticide use, surveyed water wells for pesticide residues in 11 counties. The Texas Department of Agriculture discovered 75 cases of pesticide-contaminated groundwater. The pesticides found included arsenic, dicamba, atrazine and prometon. In addition to these data, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission since 1991 has kept an Inter-agency Pesticide Database, which compiles the results of sporadic groundwater monitoring for pesticides statewide. An additional 24 cases of pesticide contamination of groundwater were listed in this database, seven of which were identified in 1993.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#99">(99)</A> 
<P>
Other risks to groundwater from agricultural activities include contamination by nitrates and arsenic. High nitrate levels are sometimes caused by infiltration from fertilizers and animal waste. Contamination by arsenic, which the Texas Water Development Board found in three Panhandle counties (Howard, Martin and Reagan) between 1972 and 1989, could be caused by arsenic-based pesticides, by naturally occurring arsenics or a combination. These high levels of arsenic were mainly found in wells pumping from the Ogallala aquifer, which is the major source of drinking and irrigation water for the Panhandle and High Plains region of Texas.

<H4>
<A NAME="BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A> 
</H4>
Coastal waters - estuaries, wetlands and bays - are critical to the economy and ecology of Texas. Almost three-fourths of the fish harvested in the Gulf of Mexico are species that depend on estuaries and wetlands for mating and spawning.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#109">(109)</A> The estuaries themselves are home to more than 80 species of animals and plants.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#110">(110)</A> Species that either live in or depend upon the estuaries include shrimp, oysters, crabs, bluecrabs and finfish. 
<P>
Thirty-two of Texas' 80 segments of estuarine waters are classified as shellfish waters. (A "segment" is a unit designated by the state for purposes of monitoring bodies of water. For estuaries, a segment is usually a seven-mile stretch of coastline.) About one million sport fishermen and 20,000 commercial fishermen catch more than 100 million pounds of coastal fish and shellfish each year in Texas' coastal waters, contributing an estimated $2.9 billion to the state's economy.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#111">(111)</A> These habitats also attract hunters, photographers, swimmers, campers, bird-watchers, boaters and sightseers, generating an additional $3 billion dollars per year.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#112">(112)</A>
<P>
As more people move into the coastal area, fragile habitat is being lost. More than one-third of the state's population now lives and works within 100 miles of the coast. Twenty percent of the state's population lives in the four-county area surrounding Galveston Bay -  Galveston, Chambers, Brazoria, and Harris counties. The Texas General Land Office estimates that by the year 2000 more than 5.3 million people will live in the coastal areas.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#113">(113)</A> Along with population growth will come increased development and demands for water and wastewater facilities, and potential threats of pollution to estuaries, wetlands and bays.

<A NAME="STATE">STATE EFFORTS TO PROTECT COASTAL WATERS</A>
</H4>
The Texas General Land Office (GLO) has primary responsibility for managing the habitats and waters of the Texas coastal region. In 1987, the General Land Office and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department agreed to set up a series of coastal preserves to help protect the estuaries. In 1988, the South Bay and Welder Flats preserves were established, followed in 1991 by the Christmas Bay preserve and the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge. State and federal coastal preserves, including South Padre Island, are discussed further in the <I>Land </I>section. 
<P>
In 1991, the Texas Legislature directed the General Land Office to head up a new Coastal Coordination Council, which has since developed a Coastal Zone Management Plan with other state agencies. The Plan may become effective in 1995. The Management Plan sets policies, standards and regulations affecting private and public property in all counties contiguous to the Texas coastline. It can impact such activities as development permits, fill-and-dredge operations, siting of oil and gas waste-disposal pits, agricultural activities and highway construction. 
<P><H4>
<A NAME="ESTUARIES">ESTUARIES</A>
</H4>
Estuaries and bays are threatened by a variety of pollution sources and are among Texas' most endangered waters. Some 80 square miles of Texas' bays have been affected by toxic pollution.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#114">(114)</A> Nearly <BR>
40 percent of open bays - 762.9 of 1,991.7 square miles - do not fully meet their designated uses under the state's water quality standards.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#115">(115)</A> These uses include swimming, shellfish harvesting and recreational fishing. 
<P>
Most of these water quality problems are related to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in Texas' shellfish harvesting areas. In 1993, the Texas Department of Health closed or restricted 625.3 miles of Texas coast to oyster harvesting due to high fecal coliform levels.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#116">(116)</A> In addition, parts of Lavaca Bay are closed to finfish and blue crab harvesting because of mercury contamination.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#117">(117)</A>

	<LI><B>Dams and reservoirs.</B> These structures stem the regular flow of rivers feeding the estuaries, resulting in changes in flow and salinity. 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Upstream water use.</B> Diversion of water from rivers decreases estuary inflow. New surface water use permits sometimes require that a portion of fresh water be set aside to protect the inflow needs of estuaries. But fresh surface water is not always available because surface water rights in most rivers in Texas have already been fully allocated. Instead, estuaries must often rely on return flows from wastewater treatment plants as their inflow from some river basins. 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Floods. </B>Land development increases the amount of impervious cover, which in turn increases the rate of surface water runoff that eventually reaches the estuaries. The wetlands surrounding estuaries act as natural filtering systems for pollutants, and these systems' filtering ability can be overwhelmed when large volumes of water, some of it contaminated with non-point-source pollution, rush in after periods of heavy rainfall. 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Drought. </B>In periods of little rainfall, municipalities, agriculture and industry all use more water, reducing the amount of inflow to the estuaries.

<A NAME="NATIONAL">THE NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAMS</A>
</H4>
Under the 1987 Clean Water Act, states can recommend to the Environmental Protection Agency that estuaries be included in the National Estuary Program. In Texas, both Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi Bay have been designated as national estuaries, making them eligible for federal and state funds to develop comprehensive management plans. The designation of the 560-square-mile Galveston Bay Estuarine System is particularly significant, since more than 60 percent of the wastewater produced in Texas eventually flows into Galveston Bay.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#120">(120)</A> 
<P>
As part of the program, a five-year assessment study of Galveston Bay preceeded the development of a management plan that addressed water quality, habitat, wildlife and human health aspects of the estuary. A draft plan, known as the Galveston Bay Plan, was released by the Galveston Bay National Estuary Program in 1994. In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency approved the Galveston Bay National Estuary Program. 
<P>
The estimated cost to the state for implementing the recommendations in the Galveston Bay Plan is $1.5 million per year in 1996 and 1997. Among the initiatives outlined in the Galveston Bay Plan are projects to: 
<UL><DL><DT></DL><LI>Reduce ambient toxicity by identifying and correcting violations of water quality standards for toxics; 
<LI>Implement stormwater programs with local municipalities; 
<LI>Eliminate discharge of brine (saltwater) from oil fields;

<A NAME="WETLANDS">WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Wetlands furnish essential habitat for many species of waterfowl, mammals, fish and other wildlife. Wetlands can be located either near the coast (coastal wetlands) or further inland (interior wetlands). Texas' 2,575 million square acres of coastal wetlands act as a natural filter for various natural and man-made contaminants, protecting the overall estuarine system. 
<P>
Wetlands are defined in state law as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Coastal wetlands include salt and fresh marshes, tidal inlands and forested scrub. 
<P>
Coastal wetlands are imperative for maintaining coastal water quality in Texas because they help filter out pollutants and because they help control excessive runoff to the bays. They also provide important nutrients for the bay ecosystem. In 1991, wetlands were recognized for the first time as "waters of the state" under Texas Water Quality Standards and are now afforded better water quality protection. Also, in 1991, the State Legislature adopted a no net loss of state-owned wetlands policy for the state of Texas. This policy has led the state Parks and Wildlife Department to develop a wetlands management plan, which other state agencies are directed to uphold to protect wetlands from destruction (see <I>Wildlife</I> chapter for details). 
<P>
<A NAME="THREATS"><B>Threats to Wetlands</A></B>
<P>
Like estuaries, wetlands are subject to a variety of threats. In 1956, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that Texas had 937,400 acres of coastal wetlands. In 1980, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department estimated there were 611,760 acres, a 35 percent decrease in less than 25 years. And saltwater intrusion caused by canals, land subsidence (sinking) and drainage ditches has severely damaged some remaining wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#122">(122)</A> Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure precisely the number of acres of wetlands in Texas, in part because the last large-scale inventory of coastal wetlands in Texas was in 1979. In addition, wetlands are difficult to survey because their appearance changes drastically with drought or flood conditions. 
<P>
Subsidence of land along the coast and the loss of coastline caused by soil erosion and a rising sea level have contributed to the loss of coastal wetlands. Each year, 225 acres of Gulf shoreline wash into the sea. An estimated 21,000 acres of shoreline were lost between the mid 1800s and 1982.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#123">(123)</A> In some areas of Texas, overpumping of groundwater has led to the subsidence, or sinking, of the land. This impact alone has led to the loss of about 24,600 acres of marshes existing since the 1950s in the four-county Galveston Bay area.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#124">(124)</A> 
<P>
Another significant cause of coastal wetlands loss is conversion of wetlands for development. Wetlands are sometimes drained and turned into rangeland or cropland or fitted for urban use. They are sometimes impacted by dredging and filling operations, conducted mainly to widen canals for navigation purposes, because dredged soil is often deposited in the wetlands' open water sites. 
<P>
One dramatic example of wetlands destruction resulting from land-use changes has been the loss of shoal grass in the Lower Laguna Madre. Over the past 20 years, there has been a 60 percent reduction in shoal grass beds in this wetland. Studies attribute the loss of sea grasses to suspension of fine particle sediment caused in part by the dredging of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#125">(125)</A> 
<P>
<A NAME="PROTECTION"><B>Wetlands Protection</A></B>
<P>
With the Clean Water Act of 1977 the federal government initiated the first truly comprehensive wetland protection program. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires the Army Corps of Engineers to issue a permit for any dredging or filling of waters of the United States. In 1986, this provision was expanded to include wetlands and water serving as habitat for migratory birds or endangered species. Normal farming, forestry and ranching activities are exempt from permit requirements. 
<P>
Though the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers actually issues the Section 404 Permits, applicants must also obtain certification from the state that a permit will not violate state water quality standards under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Of the 1,519 permits issued in 1993 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 733, or almost half, were found in the 18 counties along the Texas coast.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#126">(126)</A>

<A NAME="GULF">THE GULF OF MEXICO</A>
</H4>
The Gulf of Mexico is a recreational and economic resource for Texas, for other states that share its shoreline and for Mexico. Hazardous and industrial waste spills, illegal and legal dumping of garbage and off-shore drilling by oil and gas refineries have all led to widespread pollution of both the Gulf and Texas beaches. Pollution is also likely responsible for a 3,000-square-mile "dead zone " off the Texas-Louisiana coast, where no aquatic life lives or spawns. 
<P>
<A NAME="SPILLS"><B>Ocean Spills</A></B>
<P>
More than 102,000 vessels cart some 250 million tons of cargo to Texas' largest ports each year, about 45 percent of which is petroleum and oil-related.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#127">(127)</A> Spills and dumping from these ships during transit are among the chief causes of both marine and beach debris. Off-shore oil rigs and other petroleum-industry activity result in the discharging of chemicals and oil into Texas coastal waters, further degrading their quality. 
<P>
About a quarter of the nation's refining capacity and almost 65 percent of its petrochemical capacity are located along 367 miles of Texas shoreline. This concentration of industry means that the Gulf of Mexico serves as a major shipping route for the transport of petroleum products. In 1989, more than 115,000 tanker and barge transports carried some 1.6 billion barrels of crude oil, fuels and other petroleum products across Texas Gulf waters.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#128">(128)</A> 
<P>
The concentration of petrochemical industry also means that the Gulf is a likely site for oil spills. In the summer of 1990, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg exploded, discharging 4.6 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf. A collision between a tanker and tank-barge in August, 1990, caused some 700,000 gallons of oil to spill into Galveston Bay, blocking the Houston Ship Channel for days.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#129">(129)</A> 
<P>
In response to these spills, the Texas Legislature in 1991 passed the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act. The Act put the General Land Office in charge of oil spills and established a clean-up fund, generated by a two-cent-per-barrel fee on all crude oil being loaded or unloaded in Texas ports, to clean up "mystery spills" for which no responsible party can be identified. 
<P>
Between 1991 and 1993, there were more than 3,000 individual oil spills in coastal waters, about 25 percent of which were classified as mystery spills. These and other spills caused the fund to be used 45 times in 1992 and 1993, for a total expenditure of approximately $150,000. Of this amount, $70,000 was later recovered by locating responsible parties.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#130">(130)</A> 
<P>
The state of Texas holds title to 4 million acres of submerged land off the coast, which can be leased for oil and gas activity. In 1993, 11 rigs were operating in state waters offshore, two were operating in inshore waters, and another 227 on state land.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#131">(131)</A> Oil and gas production on federal waters is managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The central and western Gulf off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana have one of the highest oil and gas activities in the world.

<p>
<A NAME="DUMPING"><B>Ocean Dumping</A></B>
<P>
Improperly disposed of waste in Gulf waters is a major threat to marine mammals, birds and other aquatic life. Waste materials thrown off of garbage ships often entangle, maim and kill these aquatic creatures. Fish and marine mammals often eat synthetic materials, which then enters the food chain. Finally, this debris accumulates on the Texas coast, affecting both tourism and estuarine habitats. See the<I> Public Lands</I> chapter for a further discussion of beach debris.
<P>
To address this beach debris problem, the Gulf of Mexico has been earmarked as a special area under the international MARPOL treaty, which regulates marine pollution around the world. Under the treaty, the dumping of solid waste by any boat from any nation would be prohibited in a special area. The designation of "special areas," however, will not take effect until all countries sharing the Gulf have constructed special port garbage reception facilities.

<A NAME="HABITAT">WILDLIFE AND HABITAT PROTECTION LEGISLATION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has a legislative history of species and habitat protection. According to author Robin Doughty, due to over-hunting, the decline of deer, turkey and fur-bearing animals in Texas was noticeable by the 1830s and 40s.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#10">(10)</A> A decline in certain bird species was also documented at this time. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted game laws. Game laws are still prevalent today and are used to prevent the demise, or in some cases, to control the proliferation of specific species.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1860, the first game law in Texas provided closed season for the hunting of quail on Galveston Island; this act did not attempt to provide for wildlife protection statewide but was aimed at protecting the quail of Galveston Island, which were being over-hunted.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#11">(11)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>In 1879, Governor Oran M. Roberts created the first state institution for the conservation of animals. The State Fish Commissioner was appointed to improve the conditions of freshwater fish species and marine organisms that were being heavily exploited as a food resource and also were being affected by water pollution.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, under the Act to Preserve and Protect the Wild Game, Wild Birds and Wild Fowl, the state established a five-year closed season for the hunting of antelope, mountain sheep, and pheasants and ended commerce in wild animal meat, skins and plumage. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1907, a law authorized the new Game, Fish and Oyster Commissioner to sell hunting licenses to finance enforcement of game laws. (In 1910, however, the Texas Legislature appropriated the fund for other purposes and little enforcement took place.)
	<P>
	<LI>In 1925, a state law was passed to establish game preserves on privately held land.
	<P>
	<LI>In l973, The Texas Legislature enacted a state Endangered Species Act, which was amended in l981, 1985 and l987. The Act gave the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) the authority to establish a list of fish, wildlife and plants endangered or threatened with statewide extinction. Once listed, these species are afforded protection and are eligible for restoration efforts. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1983, The Texas Legislature established a Special Non-game and Endangered Species Fund to support non-game and endangered species research and management. The Fund receives money from fines, the sale of posters, stamps, and decals and from private donations. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shares a portion of the money it receives from the federal excise tax on hunting equipment with the states to support non-game and endangered species research and management.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1991, the 72nd Legislature adopted a bill adding wildlife management to the list of "agricultural uses" which qualified otherwise taxable open land for special appraisal valuation for property tax purposes. Though the Attorney General must still address some unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of this bill, essentially farmers who take land out of production and return it to a natural state for the purpose of wildlife management may be taxed according to the land's productivity value rather than its market value. In other words, the land retains its "agricultural use" property-tax status. 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In the state Endangered Species Act, there is no state criterion for protecting wildlife species from indirect take (e.g., destruction of habitat or unfavorable management practices). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department does have a Memorandum of Understanding with every state agency to conduct a thorough environmental review of state initiated and funded projects, such as highways, reservoirs, land acquisition and building construction, to determine the potential impact on state endangered or threatened species.

<A NAME="PUBLIC">PUBLIC OPINION: WHO IS LISTENING?</A>
</H4>
<P>
Surveys conducted separately by Texas A&amp;M University and Rice University reflect Texans' strong concern for wildlife. A 1989 Texas A&amp;M survey revealed that 93 percent of Texans believe that endangered species should be protected.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#13">(13)</A> A Rice University poll conducted in December 1994 showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were willing to spend more tax monies to set aside and protect wilderness areas for endangered species in Texas; 37 percent were against spending more tax monies. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed agreed that "when humans change the natural environment, by building dams or clearing forests, it often can have disasterous results." Moreover, 64 percent of those interviewed agreed with the following view: "Some restrictions on property rights are justified to protect important aspects of the environment, such as wetlands or endangered species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#14">(14)</A>
<P>
A nationwide poll conducted in May 1994 found Americans surveyed supported setting aside more land for conservation and making landowners abide by rules to protect plants and animals. The poll indicated that 66 percent of those interviewed stated that they were more concerned with the environment than they had been a few years ago. Some 65 percent of those interviewed said more land should be set aside for conservation purposes.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#15">(15)</A>

<A NAME="FISH">FISH AND WILDLIFE CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Known for its ecological diversity, Texas is the home of 5,500 plant species, 425 of which only occur in Texas. Of 1,100 vertebrate species in Texas, 60 are found nowhere else in the world. With 540 bird species, Texas has more than any other state in the U.S.
<P>
As of December 1, 1993, the federal government listed 629 U.S. plant and animal species as endangered and 189 as threatened. Four hundred and ninety-five foreign only (not found in the United States) plant and animals species are endangered and 38 foreign only plant and animal species are threatened. In the future, it is expected that 3,000 species may need to be listed as endangered and threatened.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> There are 75 federally listed and proposed species in Texas: 27 plants; 48 birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians, arachnids and insects. There are 151 state listed species in Texas: 25 plants, 126 animals.

	<I>Information furnished by the Resource Protection Division. Austin, Texas. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Texas State Office, 1995 listing.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Extinction of animal species in Texas has increased dramatically since the turn of the century. Prior to 1900, three species were known to have disappeared. Between 1901-1958 four species are known to have disappeared. From 1959 to the present, ten species have disappeared. Of these 17 species, six are globally extinct. 
<P>
The extinction rate in Texas of plant species is difficult to ascertain. The survival of plant species has become a public concern only recently, and inventories are limited.
<P>
Texas has the third highest number of listed endangered and threatened species of any state. Florida and Hawaii are number one and number two. Besides those species currently listed as endangered and threatened, there is evidence to indicate that another 305 species in Texas are candidates for the endangered and threatened lists.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
According to the American Fisheries Society's endangered species committee, Texas is one of the most hazardous places in the United States for a fish species. The state has lost six species of fish - four since 1980.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#19">(19)</A>  In 1994, 29 fish species are listed as endangered or threatened. 
<P>
Interestingly, concern for the decline in freshwater fish species in the mid 1800s in Texas spurred the state's first conservation institution - the Fish Commissioner. Because the Fish Commissioner had limited resources and authority, however, the office did little to improve conditions for fish species. Instead, the Fish Commissioner attempted to compensate for the decline in native species by introducing European carp to Texas.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<P>
The Federal Endangered Species Act requires states to design a recovery program for each listed species. In Texas, the legislature delegated this responsibility to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The American alligator is the only endangered species on the Texas list that has ever been removed from the endangered list because of successful recovery activities.
<P>
Some of the methods used in recovery programs include research on the reproductive habits and ecology of rare species, examination of the taxonomic relationship of rare species to their environment and each other to determine appropriate survival and management strategies, assistance to landowners to improve wildlife habitat, and the purchase, where funds are available, of wildlife habitats. Texas Parks and Wildlife receives enough money to study only one in 10 endangered species.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
Though scientists understand the importance of habitat to the life of a species, they are just beginning to determine what constitutes livable space for a species. Biologists do know, however, that the loss of one species in an ecosystem can sometimes threaten the balance of the entire ecosystem and may cause its demise. For instance, Texas Parks and Wildlife speculates that the extirpation of the Black-footed Ferret may have contributed to problems managing prairie dog populations.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#23">(23)</A>

<p>

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the majority of calls reporting pollution and fish kills originate in areas of high urban and industrial development. This is due both to the increased pressure on the environment in these areas as well as the larger number of people who observe and report problems. The upper Texas coastal area (Houston-Port Arthur/Beaumont) normally has the highest number of incidents for each year. Other regions that have a significant number of reports are the regions that include Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the Corpus Christi area and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#24">(24)</A>

Habitat: Due to their unique characteristics (constant temperature, clear water and in some cases isolation from connecting watercourses), these habitats are natural settings for many rare and unusual species. Status: A significant number of Texas springs have gone dry from man's activities. Over pumping of groundwater for irrigation and human use has led to lowering of groundwater tables and decreased or ceased spring discharge (the Edward's Aquifer is one example). Texas historically had 281 major springs. By 1973 only 2 of 4 very large and 17 
of 31 large springs were still flowing. Future: Increasing pressures on groundwater and aquifers will continue to impact existing springs, affecting associated flora and fauna.

Habitat: Texas' most diverse terrestrial habitat. An estimated 16 million acres of riparian (river/stream associated) habitat existed in early Texas.

Future: Additional water development, new technologies in the use of hardwood pulp, and forestry practices threaten this habitat, especially in East Texas.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Coastal Wetlands</B>
</Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: The most important estuarine habitat since 90 percent of commercially and recreationally important species depend on these wetlands. One-third of all endangered species occur here and millions of waterfowl overwinter in this habitat. Status: Some 53 percent of all USA wetlands have been lost to dredge and fill for development, subsidence and agricultural conversion. Texas has lost more than 50 percent of its original 1.2 million acres. Thirty-five percent of losses have occurred since 1950. Almost half of Texas estuarine areas are closed, or conditionally closed, to shellfish harvest because of pollution. Future: Coastal development, loss of freshwater inflows and sea level rise threaten remaining wetlands.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>South Texas Brushlands
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: A unique habitat where more than 500 vertebrate species and more than 260 species of woody plants occur. Numerous endangered species including the ocelot and jaguarundi are found here. Status: Since the 1920s, more than 95 percent of the original brushlands have been converted to agricultural and urban use. Future: Restoration of brush and acquisition of remaining habitat is key to maintaining this unique ecosystem.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Texas Prairie
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: More than 20 million acres of tallgrass communities once covered the Texas Blacklands Prairie, the Fort Worth Prairie, the Feyette Prairie and the Coastal Prairie. Status: Of the 12.6 million acres of the Blacklands Prairie, fewer than 100,000 acres (less than 10 percent) of native sod exist today. A million acres of Coastal Prairie have been urbanized by Houston. Endangered species such as the Attwater's prairie chicken are on the edge of extinction because of such losses. Future: Continued losses to this habitat is expected. Restoration, cooperative actions and private landowners will be key to saving these prairie habitats.

<A NAME="LOSS">THE LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT 
</A></H4>
<P>
Today the overwhelming majority of losses of and threats to wildlife, plants and natural communities are a direct result of habitat alteration or destruction, caused by urbanization, timber production, reservoirs and agriculture.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#25">(25)</A> According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the following are examples of habitat loss in Texas: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>All but a fraction of the prairies of central and coastal Texas have been converted to farmland, and as a result the Attwater's Prairie Chicken is on the brink of extinction and Texas Prairie Dawn, a plant of the coastal prairies, is now rare.
	<P>
	<LI>River bottom hardwood forests in Texas have been reduced from 16 to six million acres and longleaf pine forests have nearly all been cut-over. As a result of these changes, Texas Trailing Phlox and many other plants are rare, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is gone from Texas, and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is threatened with the same fate.
	<P>
	<LI>The original grasslands of South Texas have been lost to brush invasion, the grassland-dependent Aplomado Falcon disappeared from Texas, the Slender Rush-Pea is endangered, and the South Texas Ambrosia has become rare.
	<P>
	<LI>Sub-tropical woodlands of the Rio Grande Valley have been converted to farmlands and citrus plantations, resulting in near-extinction of the Ocelot in Texas and increasing rarity for many plants, such as the Texas Ayenia.
	<P>
	<LI>Ground water pumping in West Texas and dam construction throughout the state have modified springs and rivers so that species such as the Amistad Gambusia and Phantom Shiner are extinct, and many other species, such as the Puzzle Sunflower, are rare.
	<P>
	<LI>* Urbanization and land clearing in the Texas hill country have destroyed and fragmented woodland habitat of the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler, along with several rare plants.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#26">(26)</A> 
</UL>
<P>
Another indication of ecological change is the documentation that marine and brackish fishes have invaded the lower Rio Grande basin as a result of high salinity, which in turn is forcing out freshwater fish.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Texas has 133 million acres of wildlife habitat remaining. This includes springs, bottomland hardwoods, coastal wetlands, south Texas brush lands, and Texas prairies. Ninety-seven percent of the land in Texas is privately held. Therefore, the continued existence of wildlife habitat is very much in the hands of the private sector. 
<P>
Wildlife habitat in Texas is broken into eight categories:<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI><B>Grasses</B>, 32 percent - herbs, grasses, forbs and grasslike plants are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Brush</B>, 20 percent - woody plants, most less than nine feet tall, are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Shrub</B>, 15 percent - individual wood plants generally less than nine feet tall and widely scattered throughout arid region
	<P>
	<LI><B>Parks</B>, 13 percent - home to woody plants mostly equal to or greater than nine feet tall, dominant and growing as clusters 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Forest</B>, 13 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees dominant; most taller than 30 feet with closed crowns
	<P>
	<LI><B>Woods</B>, 6 percent - woody plants mostly nine to 30 feet tall with closed crowns; midstory usually lacking
	<P>
	<LI><B>Swamps</B>, less than 1 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees with varying heights within inundated or almost inundated sites
	<P>
	<LI><B>Marsh</B>, less than 1 percent - emergent herbaceous plants dominant in inundated areas, woody vegetation lacking or nearly so.

To encourage people to make environmentally-sound choices about where to live and do business in the Austin area, the Hill Country Foundation has developed a color map which includes text and graphics illustrating geologic and natural history of Travis County and parts of Williamson and Hays Counties. The map includes information on endangered species habitat areas, watersheds, aquifer recharge zones, 100-year flood plains, school district boundaries and location of major employers. The Hill Country Foundation has produced a creative tool to help citizens and businesses manage urban growth in environmentally sensitive areas. The map is being made available to the real estate and business communities to be used as a corporate relocation tool. Maybe other communities will join in this approach. <P>Contact: Hill Country Foundation, 1800 Guadalupe, Austin, Texas 78701.

<A NAME="MANAGE">WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS IN TEXAS
</A></H4>
<P>
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department owns and/or leases approximately 700,000 acres for wildlife management areas. 
<P>
The funds used for acquisition and operation of state wildlife management areas is derived from an excise tax on hunting equipment and from hunting stamps. No general revenue is used.
<P>
In Texas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages 18 national wildlife refuges, totaling 417,000 acres. 
<H4>

<A NAME="WETLANDS">WETLANDS: CRITICAL HABITATS
</A></H4>
<P>
Wetlands ecosystems are second only to the rain forests in the number of wildlife and plant species that depend on them for feeding and habitat. 
<P>
Wetlands are defined "as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#29">(29)</A> Wetlands include marshes, swamps, bogs, and shallow lakes and can include floodplains and mudflats.
<P>
Among their many valuable functions, which include filtering pollutants and preventing erosion and flooding, wetlands are the breeding, feeding and nesting grounds for many endangered species and plants and for non-endangered wildlife and natural communities. 
<P>
In recognizing the tremendous importance of wetlands, the federal government established a national goal of "no overall net loss of wetlands." The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the law that has had the greatest impact upon wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for any dredging or filling into waters of the United States. This includes both terrestrial and coastal wetlands. 
<P>
In Texas in 1993, of the 1,510 Section 404 permits issued for dredging and filling wetlands, 733 were found in coastal areas. Only 20 to 30 inland permits are issued a year and those are usually for reservoirs that significantly affect wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#30">(30)</A> This does not indicate that inland wetlands are less threatened by human activities, however. The 404 permit process is discussed in the <I><A HREF="../QualityCh2p1.html">Water Quality</A></I> chapter.

<A NAME="PROTECT">PROTECTING WETLANDS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Though Texas has lost one-half of its coastal wetlands and 60 percent of its terrestrial wetlands in the last 200 years, there is no state law to protect wetlands. In the coastal management legislation of 1991, Texas legislators did incorporate a no-net-loss of wetlands <I>policy </I>for <I>state-owned </I>land. Though this is a positive step, the majority of wetlands are on private lands. 
<P>
Three state agencies have significant roles in wetland protection: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas General Land Office. Among federal agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have significant responsibility for wetland protection. 
<P>
There are two major types of wetlands in Texas: inland/terrestrial wetlands and Coastal wetlands. Inland wetlands include bottomland hardwood forests in East Texas and riparian vegetation and playa lakes (shallow lakes) in West Texas. A discussion of coastal wetlands, including salt and freshwater marshes, is found in the section on water resources. 
<P>
Interior wetlands account for 80 percent of the total wetland acreage in Texas. Texas has lost 60 percent of its most valuable inland wetlands: the riparian communities.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#31">(31)</A> Most of the inland wetlands are on privately held properties. 
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been assigned as the lead agency to develop a state wetlands conservation plan. Though the plan will be statewide in scope, it will focus on inland wetlands, since the Texas General Land Office is developing a coastal wetlands plan. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, conserving wetlands will depend on acquisition, cooperative agreements, education and technical assistance.

<A NAME="BOTTOM">BOTTOMLAND FORESTED WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Bottomland hardwood systems are the most diverse Texas ecosystems. Bottomland wetlands are plant communities that have been created as a result of the actions of creeks, rivers and flood plains. The bottomland hardwood forest is a part of a system that starts at a river's headwaters and ends in an estuary at the ocean. Trees found in the bottom-land hardwood forests include bald cypress, pecan, oaks, elm, cottonwood and hackberry. These hardwoods, particularly old-growth hardwoods (50 to 100 years old), contribute to the biodiversity of the wetland system. They also provide food and shelter for wildlife.
<P>
At least 189 species of trees and shrubs, 42 woody vines, 75 grasses and 802 herbaceous plants occur in Texas bottomlands. Bottomland systems also support 116 species of fish, 31 species of amphibians, 54 species of reptiles, 273 species of birds and 45 species of mammals.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#32">(32)</A> Seventy-four species of threatened and endangered animals depend directly on bottomland hardwood systems. Over 50 percent of all the neotropical songbirds that are not listed as endangered or threatened are associated with bottomland hardwood forests. Thirty-one water species (mallards and wood ducks), eastern wild turkey, swamp rabbit, gray squirrel and 11 species of furbearers depend on bottomland hardwoods.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
These bottomland systems also play a vital role in maintaining water quality. By serving as a depository for sediments, wastes and pollutants from runoff, these bottomland forests enhance the water quality of bays and estuaries which lie at the lower end of these riparian corridors. Some pollutants are transformed into less harmful substances by microbiological agents in the floodplain.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#34">(34)</A> Bottomlands also play a critical role in containing floodwaters when rivers overflow. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Forested wetland systems support fish and wildlife populations that are an integral part of the state's $4.2 billion hunting and fishing industry.
</UL>
<P>
In the 18th century, Texas had approximately 16 million acres of hardwood bottomland riparian corridors. Today, the state has 5.9 million acres of bottomland hardwoods -  a 63 percent loss of bottomland hardwood. This acreage currently comprises 3 percent of the total land area of the state.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#35">(35)</A> The majority of bottomland hardwood acres are found in East Texas; only about one million acres are scattered through the western portion of the state.
<P>
Both the Texas Forest Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department recognize that there has been a steady decline in bottomland hardwood forests since the early 19th century.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#36">(36)</A> Texas Parks and Wildlife shows that losses of bottomland hardwoods are continuing in Texas at the rate of about 12 percent per decade.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#37">(37)</A> Reservoirs, development and agriculture threaten bottomland hardwood. But hardwood pulp (ground-up wood fiber) consumption is responsible for the recent upward trend in exploitation of bottomland ecosystems in Texas. Pulpwood consumption in the U.S. is expected to more than double from 82 million tons in l986 to 173 million tons by 2040, and pulpwood demand worldwide has further stimulated increased consumption of hardwoods. This demand is fueled by the demand for high quality computer paper, white cardboard shipping cartons and other paper products, such as six-pack soda carriers, which require a higher hardwood fiber component.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#38">(38)</A> In the U.S., Texas ranks seventh in pulpwood consumption by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#39">(39)</A>

<H4><A NAME="PLAYA">PLAYA LAKES</A></H4>
<P>
Texas playa lakes - shallow, circular basins - are the wintering wetland habitat for millions of waterfowl that migrate from as far north as Canada. There are 20,000 playa lakes located in 37 counties of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. The total area of playa basins has been estimated at 296,000 acres. Fifteen million birds annually migrate through these playas in the fall and spring on their way to and from wintering habitat on the Gulf Coast and farther south.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#40">(40)</A> Ducks, geese and sandhill cranes also use these playas as winter havens. The majority of these oases of wildlife habitat are located within intensively cultivated, privately held farmland. Precipitation and irrigation runoff contribute to the development of these wetlands. Land use practices and changes in irrigation methods intended to limit runoff are reducing the capacity of playas to provide food and water for waterfowl.

<P>
Soil is the material that is formed from rocks and decaying plants and animals; it makes up the outermost layer of the earth. There are at least 70,000 kinds of soil in the United States. Topsoil is considered the most productive soil layer. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, natural processes can take 500 years to form one inch of topsoil.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<H4><A NAME="CROPLAND">CROPLAND EROSION</A></H4>
Though concern for soil erosion in the United States dates back to the days of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the federal government did not take action to address the problem until 1933. The dust storms of the 1930s, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas, resulted in tremendous crop and farm loss and thousands of unemployed farmers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#2">(2)</A> This brought Presidential and Congressional attention to issues of soil erosion. 
<P>
One of the first steps Congress took was to create the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put unemployed men, including farmers, to work planting trees and building erosion control dams. In 1935, the Soil Conservation Service was established within the United States Department of Agriculture and began to work directly with farmers around the country creating soil and water conservation districts. Soil and Water Conservation Districts are political subdivisions of the state, governed by a board of directors elected by resident landowners of the district. Some of the soil erosion correctives recommended in the 1930s included crop rotation, contour plowing, planting tree rows and leaving marginal lands as pasture land. These practices were credited with arresting soil erosion for a time.  
<P>
Texas enacted its own Soil Conservation Laws in 1939, resulting in the establishment of the Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board. The Board coordinates the activities of the local soil and water conservation districts, which numbered 213 in 1994. 
<P>
In the 1970s, an increase in worldwide demand for farm commodities led the U.S. government to create new crop subsidy incentives to persuade farmers to plant "fencerow to fencerow." Farmers eager to increase production put marginal lands into production and discontinued the practice of crop rotation. To combat the depletion of overused soils, farmers had to increase their use of chemical fertilizers. By the mid 1980s, new federal action was needed to confront the problem of soil erosion. The current Food Security Act of 1985 (aka the 1985 Farm Bill) contains two major features, informally called the "sodbuster" programs, that address soil erosion. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers to take highly erodible land out of production for 10 years. The Conservation Compliance Provision (CCP) requires farmers with highly erodible land to implement approved conservation plans by December 31, 1994, to be eligible for any federal farm program benefits.      
<P>
Large scale loss of soil from erosion results in at least two major environmental problems. First, cropland becomes less productive because the soil left after erosion loses its fertility and is unable to supply plants with necessary nutrients. The soil's ability to retain water is also greatly diminished. These changes, in turn, result in higher production costs, including the costs for the increased use of petrochemical-based fertilizers. Second, soil erosion by water causes sedimentation in waterways which threatens aquatic life and hinders the water flow. Soil erosion by water also carries polluting agricultural chemicals into rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. According to a 1989 study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, 350 to 400 million acres of agricultural land are estimated to account for more than 50 percent of suspended sediments deposited in surface waters in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#3">(3)</A>  
<P>
Experts recognize the difficulty in accurately assessing costs of soil erosion, but the USDA has estimated that the offsite costs to society of erosion in the United States are between $2 billion and $8 billion annually, and the direct onsite farm cost is estimated at $1 billion to $18 billion per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#4">(4)</A>  The United States Department of Agriculture, however, has expressed doubts about the reliability of these estimates.

<P>
Of the 32 million acres of cropland in Texas, more than 12.8 million acres or 40 percent are classified as highly erodible.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#5">(5)</A>  With an average loss of 14 tons of soil per acre annually, Texas is one of the eight worst states for soil erosion rates.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#6">(6)</A>    
<P>
Water erosion is the primary concern for the central and eastern parts of Texas. Wind erosion is the primary concern in far west Texas and the High Plains region. Both wind and water are concerns in the Rolling Plains and southern parts of the state.
<P>
The Federal and State agencies that have major responsibility for the well-being of our soil are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>The Consolidated Farm Service Agency, formerly known as the USDA Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Services.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#7">(7)</A> This is the USDA's state-level administrative arm. Since the 1930s, Texas and other states have received federal monies under the Agricultural Conservation Program for direct assistance to producers. Under this program, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency distributes approximately $13 million federal dollars annually to Texas producers to assist them in implementing 15 to 20 best management practices. These practices include terracing, ponds, wells, irrigation and agriculture waste facilities. In 1993, approximately $164,000,000 was distributed to Texas farmers under the Conservation Reserve Program.
	<P>
	<LI>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation Service. This service is responsible for all soil and water conservation programs, the Wetlands Reserve program and other programs related to natural resources conservation. Through a memorandum of understanding with local Soil Conservation Districts, the Service assists agricultural producers, on a voluntary basis, in designing site-specific conservation management plans. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board. This is a state agency with a five member Board elected by delegations from the soil conservation districts. The Board coordinates the activities of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts, develops a statewide conservation plan and is the lead agency for designing site-specific programs to abate non-point source pollution resulting from agriculture and silviculture. In fiscal year 1994, the Board received a state appropriation of $5,200,586. Almost $2 million of this was targeted for the non-point source pollution programs. For fiscal year 1995, the Board was appropriated $7,319,298, of which approximately $4,035,187 is targeted for non-point source pollution programs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#8">(8)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>The Soil and Water Conservation Districts. There are 213 soil conservation districts in Texas. Most districts conform to county boundary lines. Each district has an elected board of directors made up of district landowners. Among other activities, the local Soil Conservation District Board coordinates the technical assistance to producers provided by USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. The districts also prepare long-range soil and water conservation plans for the area.   
	<P>
	<LI>The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, formerly the Texas A&amp;M Extension Service. This Service provides a link between agricultural producers and agricultural research. Through county offices, it provides educational programs and materials to producers, farm workers and homeowners on such subjects as the proper use of agricultural chemicals, new agricultural technology and conservation practices.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Natural resource experts have divided Texas into 11 major land resource areas, based on similar soils, vegetation, climate and land uses. These are often referred to as "ecoregions." 
</UL>
<P>
Soil erosion levels vary among types of soil, and, of course, some erosion is natural and inevitable. The amount of soil erosion that most cropland can tolerate without reducing production is termed by the United States Department of Agriculture the "T" factor. In Texas, the "T" factor for most cropland is about five tons per acre per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#10">(10)</A>  Most Texas cropland can lose five tons of soil a year for an indefinite period of time without production being affected. The objective of conservation practices is to bring erosion down to or below this "T" factor.    
<P>
According to the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, total gross sheet and rill erosion within Texas averages about 229 million tons annually. This is an average annual rate of 1.36 tons per acre. Gross gully and stream erosion averages about 98 million tons annually, or an average rate of 0.58 tons per acre.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
Soil erosion by water is a problem on about 24.3 million acres of Texas cropland and grassland.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#12">(12)</A> Figures are not available on the number of acres on which wind erosion has a large impact.

Sedimentation is usually the end result of the erosion process. When a soil particle is detached and transported by water to a new site of deposit, it is referred to as sediment. The soil particle might be temporarily deposited several times before it reaches its end destination.

<A NAME="EROSION">CROPLAND EROSION AND SURFACE WATER</A>
</H4>
<p>
Cropland erosion has impacts on more than agricultural production. According to studies conducted by the USDA in 1987, agriculture accounts for more than "50 percent of suspended sediments from all sources discharged in surface waters" and greater proportions in predominantly agricultural regions.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#13">(13)</A> Findings of a nationwide study conducted from 1974 to 1981 concluded that surface water sediment deposition was "significantly related to cropland erosion within basins. It was not closely related to estimates of total basin erosion from forest land, pasture land or range land."<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#14">(14) </A> 
<p>
The increased murkiness in the water caused by sediment loading decreases light for submerged aquatic vegetation. As a result, both aquatic vegetation and species that depend on aquatic vegetation for breeding and food can decline.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#15">(15)</A> The relationship between sediment and nutrient runoff from agricultural lands and their effects on estuaries is discussed in the water chapter. Sediment loading can also fill reservoirs, clog navigable waterways, reduce recreational use of waters and increase operating costs of water-treatment facilities.  
<p>
Some sediment deposits can be beneficial, however. For example, the replenishment of beaches is dependent upon sediment deposits from rivers. 
<p>
The USDA estimates that putting 30 to 40 million acres of highly erodible U.S. cropland out of production and into the Conservation Reserve Program will reduce sediment delivery to surface waters by as much as 200 million tons per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#16">(16)</A>
<p>
Texas has no data that show whether various erosion control strategies have reduced sedimentation in Texas surface waters. The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board states that "soil erosion and sediment production continue to be major problems in Texas," though it speculates that there has been significant improvement in the last few decades.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#17">(17)</A> The Board, lead agency for non-point source pollution from agriculture, has recommended expanded stream and reservoir sedimentation studies, stating that past studies have been incomplete.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#18">(18)</A>
<p>
According to the Texas Water Development Board, sediment buildup in reservoirs has not caused a major water supply problem to date, but the agency continues to monitor the situation. The TWDB studies show that Lake Buchanan in Central Texas does have noticeable amounts of sediment as does Lake Corpus Christi.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#19">(19)</A>   
<p>
In Texas, average annual sediment yields - that portion of the total eroded soil that reaches a reservoir - vary from one land resource area to another and vary within land resource areas. According to a USDA study, sediment yields have varied from a low of 0.6 acre-foot per square mile at a site west of Lampasas to a high of 8.60 acre-feet per square mile at a site northeast of Bowie in Montague county.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#20">(20)</A>

</H4>
<p>
One of the best treatments for highly erodible land is to take it out of production and plant grass cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#21">(21)</A> To speed this practice along, the 1985 Farm Bill's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was formulated to provide financial incentives to farmers who voluntarily take highly erodible cropland and other environmentally fragile land (e.g., wetlands, wildlife habitat) out of production for ten years. This means no haying, grazing or harvesting of the land. Though there is a 25 percent cap per county on the amount of land that can be eligible, the program does provide farmers with the opportunity to receive $40 per acre per year rental fee to retire land and a 50/50 cost-share payment to plant a permanent soil-conserving cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<p>
Cropland retired under the CRP was eroding at 13 tons per acre per year. After taking it out of production and establishing coverage, the rate of erosion is 2 tons per year.  
<p>
With 4.2 million acres - 12 percent of all cropland - in the Conservation Reserve Program, Texas has more land in the program than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#23">(23)</A> (Due to the amount of cropland in production, Texas, of course, has more potential acres to be in the CRP.)      
<p>
In 1993, Texas producers received $164 million in rental fees, and approximately $100 million in cost sharing from the inception of the program in 1986 to 1993 in return for taking more than 4 million acres out of production and converting it to grass. The average one-time cost share for establishing grass cover is $25 per acre. More than 80 percent of the CRP acreage is in the High Plains and Rolling Plains. Reduced erosion - an estimated 22 percent reduction on U.S. cropland since 1985 - is not the only benefit of the Conservation Reserve Program. Environmental benefits include improvement in air and water quality and an increase in wildlife habitat for game and nongame birds, mammals and reptiles. Soil conservation specialists in Terry and Lubbock counties report a noticeable reduction in wind erosion and change in air quality as well as an increase in wildlife since cropland has been enrolled in the CRP.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#24">(24)</A>  The Environmental Working Group notes that the CRP has saved the state 144.8 million tons of soil annually.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<p>
The <I>Wall Street Journal </I>reports that the CRP program has its critics. The average age of landowners participating in the program is 64, leading some to believe that it is a "welfare plan" for retired farmers. Others complain that too much good farmland has been allowed in the CRP program. Meanwhile, there are residents of the Texas Panhandle who complain that taking 20 percent of the Plains farmland out of production has devastated related businesses, such as cotton gins and seed, pesticide and equipment dealers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#26">(26)</A> There has also been criticism about the high cost of the CRP. CRP proponents suggest, however, if farmers who are currently enrolled in the CRP were growing rice, cotton, grains and other crops eligible for income supports, their deficiency payments would be equal to, if not more than, the CRP costs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#27">(27)</A> In addition, the USDA estimates the CRP's environmental benefits at between $6 billion and $13 billion over the life of the contracts.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<p>
Unless extended, the CRP program will begin to phase out in 1995. Much of the acreage now enrolled in the CRP will revert to row crop and forage production. A study conducted by Texas Tech University's Department of Agricultural Economics found that, in 55 counties in the Plains, economic considerations will encourage farmers to return 64 percent of the land to crop production unless the CRP is extended.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#29">(29)</A>  This is not just the prediction for Texas; according to the Soil and Water and Conservation Society the return of CRP land to production will occur nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#30">(30)</A> A revised CRP program that targets truly erodible land for inclusion might be presented to Congress in 1995.  
<p>
The other major erosion-abatement provision created by the 1985 Food Security Act is the Conservation Compliance Provision. This provision required farmers who had highly erodible land and who wanted to retain eligibility for government program benefits to implement a conservation plan and have it approved by the Soil Conservation Service by December 31, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#31">(31)</A>   
<p>
Conservation tillage is one good example of mature conservation practices.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#32">(32)</A>  According to the Conservation Technology Information Center, a not-for-profit organization that provides research on soil conservation, 22.4 percent (4,482,961 acres) of Texas cropland is in conservation tillage.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#33">(33)</A> Conservation tillage is expected to increase as a means to meet the requirements of the conservation compliance provision, but experts suggest that continued research is needed to better understand its effects and to determine which types of crops respond best.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#34">(34)</A>

Note: El Paso represents a special case. The graphic only shows sources from within the El Paso County area, where an estimated 88 tons of NOx and 90 tons of VOCs are released into the atmosphere -  a relatively low amount compared to Texas' other cities. However, El Paso shares the border with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which has a significant influence on air quality in Mexico. A special section later in this chapter - "Sharing Air Along the U.S. -Mexico Border" - will highlight some of these issues.

Quality, Page 3</H5>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="NATIONAL">NATIONAL</A> AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
</H4>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act contained other market-based approaches to pollution control. The EPA may now issue allowances to companies for the manufacture of chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that deplete atmospheric ozone even though the manufacture of these chemicals is being phased out. The Act also has provisions that allow one facility's reductions in ozone-forming pollutants or toxic chemicals to offset increased emissions at another facility. Texas has embraced several of these new market-based approaches in its effort to reduce pollution.
<P>
How these efforts will ultimately improve air quality is still unknown. The EPA says that 90 million Americans live in cities that are non-attainment for at least one of the six main air pollutants targeted by the Federal Clean Air Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#18">(18)</A> In addition, there are possible global problems -  such as ozone depletion and global warming -  which may defy strictly national solutions. Other "air" issues, such as indoor air pollution, are not addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act at all.
<P>
Moreover, none of the changes mandated by the law come cheaply. Industries large and small will feel the effects of the Federal Clean Air Act. For example, in areas of the state not meeting ozone standards, tough new emission standards will require businesses to install expensive pollution control equipment. These businesses will also have to apply for new federal operating permits. In some sectors, such as electric utilities and petroleum refineries, these requirements have already led to some job losses. Even small businesses like dry cleaners, bakeries and printers will have to install new equipment to control emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Because the Federal Clean Air Act greatly expanded the scope of government regulation, the government's cost of monitoring and enforcing air-quality law has also increased.  
<P>
These anticipated economic impacts were the main source of opposition to the bill. Still, the Act will create new markets for alternative fuels, pollution control equipment and new services, thus creating new jobs. And supporters believe that the economic value of the Act's public-health benefits - measured in fewer sick days, hospitalizations and deaths - will more than offset initial economic costs.

With 18 million cars on its roads, 442 electric utility generators using gas, oil, coal and other sources of fuel, 60 percent of the nation's petrochemical production, 25 percent of the nation's refining capacity and a population of more than 18 million people, Texas must grapple with the full range of clean air issues. The state consistently ranks at or near the top of the list in air toxic emissions, reflective of the disproportionate amount of petrochemical production relative to the rest of the country. Half of the state's population lives in "non-attainment" cities, which do not meet federal standards for clean air.
<P>
This chapter discusses air quality in Texas, outlining the problems and summarizing the efforts to deal with it. It is divided into six sections:
<P>
<B><OL>
	<LI>  National Ambient Air Quality Standards
	<P>
	<LI>  Clean Air Act Compliance in Texas
	<P>
	<LI>  Other Air Quality Issues
	<P>
	<LI>  Mobile Sources
	<P>
	<LI>  Major Stationary Sources 
	<P>
	<LI>  Small Businesses and Minor Stationary Sources
</OL>
</B><P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Acts set forth air quality standards for six pollutants: ozone (03), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable particulate matter (PM10) and lead (Pb). The Environmental Protection Agency has determined an allowable limit for each of these pollutants that is intended to protect the public from exposure to dangerous levels. These national standards are known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
<P>
One set of standards, called primary standards, is designed to protect human health. Another set, called secondary standards, is designed to protect the environment and limit property damage. Any area of a city that exceeds a standard causes the entire metropolitan area to be in violation. Since the EPA began regulating these pollutants, levels of all have declined. Most emissions have shown a modest decline. The exception is lead, which showed a sharp decline (90 percent) between 1982 and 1991. This dramatic reduction is due largely to the phase out of leaded gasoline which began in the 1970s. Today, the most abundant single pollutant is carbon monoxide, accounting for about 50 percent of total emissions by weight. 
<P>
At monitoring stations around the state, the four gaseous criteria pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) are monitored continuously, with one-hour averages measured each hour, every day. PM10 and lead are measured at least once every six days for a 24-hour averaging period, although some sites in Texas are monitored more frequently. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, local governmental agencies and some private organizations monitor for criteria pollutants (see box in text on monitoring).

<H4>
<A NAME="OZONE">A. OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
In the upper atmosphere, ozone (O3), an oxygen molecule with three, rather than two, oxygen atoms, forms a layer that filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Concern about the thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer has led to bans on the use of certain chemicals, such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, that may destroy ozone. 
<P>
Though atmospheric ozone helps sustain life, ozone formed near the ground may adversely affect plants, animals and humans. Ozone is produced when reactive hydrocarbons known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight. Ozone problems are most common in the hot summer months because the warm air and sunlight speed ozone formation. 
<P>
Volatile organic compounds are emitted from a wide variety of sources. These include automobiles and other vehicles (referred to as "mobile sources" in the Federal Clean Air Act); refineries and chemical manufacturing plants ("major stationary sources"); paint shops and dry cleaners ("minor" or "area sources"); recreational boats, ships, barges, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, and locomotives ("off-road mobile sources"); and plants and trees ("biogenics"). Yes, even trees contribute to VOCs (see box in text). Nitrogen oxide comes from some of the same sources - automobiles, boats, trains and planes, and refineries - as well as from service stations, home heating and cooling units, wastewater treatment plants, power plants and forest fires. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has estimated both the amount and the sources of VOCs and NOx released into the atmosphere in major Texas metropolitan areas.
<P>
<B>Non-Attainment Areas.</B>
<P>
Four metropolitan areas in Texas have exceeded the national standards for ozone often enough to be currently classified as non-attainment areas. They are: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Dallas/Fort Worth and El Paso. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria metropolitan area reports the highest numbers of days exceeding ozone standards in Texas. In general, Texas cities have shown a decline over the past 10 years in the number of days exceeding national standards. Other large Texas cities like Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi have met the ozone standard since the early 1980s. Still, in both 1993 and 1994, Corpus Christi exceeded the one-hour ozone standards on one occassion, and Austin and San Antonio approached it.
<P>
<B>Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone.</B>
<P>
High levels of ozone - including levels above the 0.125 parts per million standard - can have serious human health effects. Ozone reacts with lung tissue and can cause breathing problems. The risk of asthma may be increased and people may cough and have chest pains. For unknown reasons, about 10 to 20 percent of the population, sometimes referred to as "responders," is especially sensitive to high ozone concentrations. This group, along with people with pre-existing respiratory diseases and people who exercise outdoors, are particularly at risk from high ozone levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#20">(20)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">A 1988 study for the American Lung Association estimated that if ozone standards had been met throughout the United States in 1983, 49.9 million cases of adverse health symptoms and 1.9 million asthma attacks would have been eliminated.

</UL>
<P>
High ground levels of ozone can also have negative environmental effects. It is believed to affect crop and forestry production by damaging the cell walls of plants. In 1987, the East Texas Intensive Research Site was established near Nacogdoches to investigate how pollutants affect the development of one- to four-year-old short leaf pines along coastal plains. The study subjected some trees to persistent exposure to ozone and the trees showed loss of needles, stunted growth and fewer stems.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#21">(21)</A>

<tr><th>DO TREES POLLUTE?</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Do trees pollute? In the early 1980s, then-President Ronald Reagan and some noted scientists attracted attention when they confirmed that trees themselves are a possible source of some types of air pollution. Trees do contribute to the formation of ozone by releasing volatile organic compounds such as isoprene, monoterpene and alpha-pinene. 
<P>
Under Title 1 of the Federal Clean Air Act, states are required to estimate how much trees and plants contribute to VOC production for those areas that exceed ozone standards. The sources of these VOCs, known collectively as "biogenics," include forests, crops, lawn grasses and other vegetation. The more vegetation an area has, the more these biogenics will contribute to overall VOC levels. For example, biogenics are estimated to account for 22 percent of all VOCs emitted in the woody Houston/Galveston area, but only 12 percent in the arid El Paso area.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#19">(19)</A> Of course, biogenic sources are natural sources of air pollution and no one is suggesting that trees be cut to reduce pollution. In fact, the air quality benefits of biogenics far outweigh the costs since plants produce oxygen, filter the air and prevent erosion. Biogenic sources are not figured into the calculation of how much an area must reduce VOC emissions.

<A NAME="SULFUR">B. SULFUR DIOXIDE</A> AND NITROGEN OXIDES - THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ACID RAIN
</H4>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are gases released when fossil fuels are burned. When these gases react with water in the atmosphere, sulfuric acid and nitric acids can form and fall as rain, commonly referred to as "acid" rain. In areas with little precipitation, the acids may become incorporated into dust and smoke and fall to the ground as "dry" acid.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#22">(22)</A> Acid rain can harm or kill fish by making lakes and rivers more acidic, i.e. by lowering the pH. It can also damage buildings, stone and monuments as well as crops and forests. Studies indicate that acid rain can also reduce crop yields both by damaging foliage and by causing minerals to leach from the soil.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#23">(23)</A>  While adverse affects have been reported in the Northeast, no harmful effects have been documented in Texas. This is because of two factors: 1) the strongly alkaline soils characteristic of much of the state; and 2) the absence of a snow pack melt common in more northern states.
<P>
Both nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide have been linked to the formation of acid rain and acidic lakes. Pinpointing the cause of acid rain is difficult, primarily because of multiple emission sources and complex meteorology. Rain can become acidic as a result of water reacting with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. But other factors, such as acidic waste runoff and naturally high acidic levels in lakes or streams, may also contribute to acidity. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board, later the TNRCC, and the federal government began monitoring the acidity (pH) of rain at 15 different sites. In general, the pH was lower - more acidic - in rainfall collected in East Texas.
<P>
Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides have other harmful effects in addition to their ability to form acid rain deposition. At high levels, nitrogen oxides are known to cause lung damage and other respiratory illness, particularly in children and people suffering from asthma.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#24">(24)</A> In Texas, nitrogen dioxide has never exceeded the national standard set in 1973. It does, however, contribute to the formation of ozone (see previous section). 
<P>
High concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air may cause difficulty in breathing and a choking sensation. Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and people with chronic lung and heart disease are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of sulfur dioxide. 
<P>
Unlike nitrogen oxide - which is mainly the result of automobile and utility emissions - sulfur dioxide is emitted chiefly from industrial sources like power plants using sulfur-containing fuel, metallic-ore smelting facilities, wood and paper industrial processors and oil and gas refineries. 
<P>
Sulfur dioxide levels in Texas vary across the state. The Houston/Galveston/Texas City area, the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, and the El Paso metropolitan area have shown the highest levels of SO2 measured in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#25">(25)</A> While most areas in the state do not exceed or even approach the air quality standards for SO2, tests conducted between 1985 and 1989 by the Houston Regional Monitoring Network, a private organization, showed sulfur dioxide levels in excess of national standards 13 times in the industrial district of the Houston Ship Channel.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#26">(26)</A> Cooperative action between local industries, the TNRCC and the EPA has resulted in a voluntary reduction in SO2 emissions in the local area and no violations have been recorded since 1990.

<A NAME="CARBON">C. CARBON MONOXIDE</A>
</H4>
<P>
A colorless, odorless gas, carbon monoxide results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, most often in motor vehicles and power plants. Carbon monoxide can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the heart, brain and other tissues. People with heart disease and unborn or newborn children are especially susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#27">(27)</A> The area in Texas where the highest levels of CO are measured is El Paso, but even here, the NAAQS has not been exceeded more than 10 times per year. Carbon monoxide has also been identified as a possible precursor to the formation of ozone.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
Unlike ozone, carbon monoxide levels usually rise with colder weather, when atmospheric conditions are more stable. In Texas, only El Paso has consistently exceeded the eight-hour standard for carbon monoxide concentrations. Most notably, however, levels measured in recent years are lower than those measured ten years ago. Dallas exceeded standards twice in 1985, while Houston exceeded standards nine times between 1974 and 1986. No other exceedences in these two cities have since been recorded due to state and federal efforts to control carbon monoxide emissions. According to the 1990 EPA data base, El Paso ranked 5th in the nation, behind Steubenville, Ohio; Provo, Utah; Los Angeles, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada for levels of eight-hour concentrations of carbon monoxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#29">(29)</A> However, 1994 data places El Paso behind eleven other U.S. cities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#30">(30)</A>
<P>
El Paso is a special case because it shares a common airshed with Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico and is affected by that city's air pollution. A special section later in this chapter -  "Sharing Air Along the U.S. - Mexico Border" -  highlights some of these issues. In Texas, the levels and sources of carbon monoxide vary by location.

<A NAME="PARTICULATE">D. PARTICULATE MATTER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The category of air pollutant called "respirable particulate matter" includes liquids, hydrocarbons, soots, dusts, acids from aerosols and smoke particles that are smaller than 10 microns in diameter. This 10-micron size limit has led to the abbreviation of respirable particulate matter as "PM 10." These tiny particles make up about 55 percent of the total mass of suspended particles in air pollution, and come from the burning of fuels by industry, power plants and motor vehicles; from refuse incinerators; from dust created by construction, agriculture and unpaved roads; and from natural sources such as wind erosion.
<P>
While the nose can filter out larger particulates, PM10 can penetrate deep into the lungs. The further a particle penetrates and the higher the concentration, the more likely it is to cause wheezing, nose and throat irritation, bronchitis and lung damage. Chemicals such as toxic compounds attached to PM10 emissions can increase the potential for adverse effects. Groups at high risk include children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema. Beyond these health hazards, PM10 reduces visibility and can discolor clothing and property.
<P>
In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency revised its air quality standards for PM10, allowing a maximum of 150 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24-hour basis, or 50 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual average. Previously, the EPA had no specific standard for PM10, instead relying on a standard for all particulate matter, including particulate matter larger than 10 microns. The EPA estimates that adherence to these new standards will save 3,600 lives, reduce lost work days by 190,000 days and "reduced-activity" days, when people work less efficiently because of ill health, by 910,000 days.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#31">(31)</A>
<P>

Still there has been considerable debate about whether these levels adequately safeguard human health and some studies have suggested that standards should be strengthened.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#32">(32)</A> A recent study, which controlled for the effects of smoking, found that mortality risks are more strongly associated with concentrations of respirable particles and sulfates - the combination of sulfur dioxide with air - than with other common air pollution problems such as ozone or sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">Another study tracked 552,138 men and women across the United States from 1982 to 1989 and evaluated the effects of particulate air pollution - including sulfates and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns - on mortality. The study found an association between mortality due to cardiopulmonary diseases and particulate matter air pollution.
	<P>

Arden Pope III, Micheal Thun, Mohan Namboodiri, Douglas Dockery, John Evans, Frank Speizer and Clark Heath, Jr., "Particulate Air Pollution as a Predictor of Mortality in a Prospective Study of U.S. Adults," </I>American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care Medicine<I>, Vol. 151 (1995): 669 - 674.</I>
</UL>
<P>
While the EPA is currently reviewing the Federal PM10 standard, some states have already adopted a more stringent standard. For example, the state of California, after reviewing studies on morbidity and mortality from PM10 exposure, adopted a state air-quality standard for particulate matter of 50 micrograms over 24 hours. 
<P>
In Texas, only El Paso County has repeatedly exceeded both the 24-hour and annual standards set in 1987 for PM10. Other areas have occasionally exceeded this standard. In 1992, there were two exceedences out of 337 samples in El Paso. In 1993, there were none, while in 1994, there were two exceedences.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#34">(34)</A> In El Paso, particulate matter levels rise during winter months, due mainly to combustion of wood and other fuels for heating. 
<P>
El Paso is also impacted by particulate matter drifting from Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez in Mexico. Common sources of this particulate matter include unpaved roads and industrial combustion processes such as the incineration of garbage, including tires, without adequate controls. However, without adequate emissions inventories and ambient air quality monitoring in Ciudad Juarez to record air quality over time, it is difficult to determine if emissions are going down. TNRCC, the Environmental Defense Fund and others are working with Mexican environmental officials to address these needs.

<A NAME="LEAD">E. LEAD</A>
</H4>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1991, air emissions of lead in the United States were reduced from 52,000 to 5,000 tons per year, largely as a result of the country's phase-out of leaded gasoline.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#35">(35)</A> Nevertheless, lead continues to pose a public health threat, in part because of its persistence in the environment. Lead poisoning can lead to retardation in cognitive development in children, reduce mental ability and damage nerves and organs like livers and kidneys. It also may interfere with the creation of blood and raise blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#36">(36)</A> Because lead accumulates in the body organs, bones and blood, even chronic exposure to small amounts can be harmful to both human and animal life. Besides leaded gasoline, sources of lead pollution in the air include metal smelters and the manufacture and reclamation of lead batteries. Children and pregnant women are most at risk from exposure to high lead levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#37">(37)</A>
<P>
In Texas, outside air pollution from lead is now limited to a handful of areas. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, citizens were concerned about the number of lead smelters and battery plants in the area, but most of these facilities were shut down in the mid-1980s. Suspected health problems from exposure to high lead levels continue to concern Dallas-area residents. However, monitors show no exceedences at this time. In the city of Frisco in Collin County, ambient air levels of lead have exceeded national standards in an area of approximately one-half mile near a major battery plant. However, the last exceedences for lead national standards were in 1987.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#38">(38)</A> Although lead exposure concerns had been raised over a 1.5-mile square surrounding an old battery reclamation plant in San Antonio, the site is currently designated as "unclassified" by the EPA until further monitoring can confirm the levels of lead in the air. 
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, several monitoring sites in the city of El Paso violated national standards for lead. However, the closing of a lead smelter plant in 1985 and the phase-out of leaded gasoline have brought levels in El Paso to within the allowable limit since 1986. Generally speaking, lead is not a big problem in ambient air in Texas. Thus, there is a greater potential for lead exposure in individual households because of the possible presence of peeling lead-based paint.

<tr><th>AIR QUALITY MONITORING: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW?
</th></tr><tr><td>
If you can't always see it, taste it, or maybe even smell it, how do you know air pollution is there? Texas' extensive monitoring network strives to answer that question by measuring concentrations of ambient air pollutants. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission operates more than 80 permanent monitoring sites located across the state. In addition, six local governmental entities and four private organizations monitor the six criteria pollutants at other stations in an effort to pinpoint local problems. Many of these stations also monitor air toxics. 
<P>
Despite the presence of these monitors in the major metropolitan areas, federal requirements and citizen concern about the health effects of toxics are generating a demand for more and better air-quality monitoring. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has invested about $1.5 million a year since 1992 to expand and operate its air toxics monitoring network. The agency plans to add 29 new toxic air monitoring stations by the end of 1995. Despite the large volume of toxics released each year into the air by Texas industries, ambient air toxics monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has not identified them as a significant public health risk.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#39">(39)</A> Air toxics selected for monitoring were those emitted in the largest quantities from multiple sources. While it is not possible to monitor for all chemical compounds emitted, the results of monitoring currently conducted are considered indicative of broad-based public exposure to other compounds by the TNRCC. Some monitoring methods collect average samples of toxics, and thus, higher peak concentrations would not be quantified, although they would be represented as part of the average itself.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#40">(40)</A> 
<P>
To complement its monitoring system, the TNRCC is investing in a more complete toxics monitoring network and expanding its use of mobile monitoring equipment, which includes a self-contained mobile laboratory, sampling vans and an air toxics response trailer.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#41">(41)</A>

<A NAME="ACT"><H4>FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
Under Title 1 of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, any area that violates National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the six criteria pollutants as few as once per year and as often as four times over a three-year period is classified as a "non-attainment area." Texas currently has four such areas, encompassing 17 counties. Victoria County and portions of Bexar County have been designated "unclassified" because their monitoring data for ozone and lead, respectively, have not been adequate to measure pollution levels precisely. The Houston Ship Channel in the Houston metropolitan area had been proposed as a non-attainment area for sulfur dioxide. However, recent cooperative activities by the TNRCC, EPA and industries in the area resulted in the submission of an attainment demonstration to the EPA.
<P>
Non-attainment areas for ozone, CO and PM10 are classified according to the severity of their air pollution. Each area is included in a State Implementation Plan (SIP) designed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to bring the area into compliance. Different areas may have different deadlines for complying with the SIP plan, depending upon the severity of their air pollution problem. If a non-attainment area fails to comply with air pollution standards by the deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency may extend the deadline, but impose more stringent requirements to meet the standards. If there is a failure to develop a proper State Implementation Plan or a failure to implement the plan, the Environmental Protection Agency may develop a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area and may impose sanctions for non-compliance including the loss of federal highway funds, bans or stiffer limits on further industrial expansion and the loss of federal Air Pollution Control Program grant funds. 
<P>
The economic costs of non-attainment are substantial. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission estimates that it will cost $200 billion to bring Texas' four ozone non-attainment areas into compliance.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#42">(42)</A> By 1996, the four ozone non-attainment areas must reduce levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 15 percent, net of growth, from 1990 levels. This net reduction requirement means that before any new sources of VOCs can be allowed to operate, reductions must be made in existing sources to offset the new emissions. Thus, the actual total reduction is significantly higher than 15 percent. 
<P>
Once volatile organic compounds are reduced by 15 percent by 1996, serious and severely polluted areas - which include Houston, El Paso and Beaumont - will still be required to reduce either volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides an average of 3 percent each year for three years, or until standards are met. Thus, future economic growth and reductions in air pollution are linked together. 
<P>
The State Implementation Plan is also requiring consumers, small businesses and major industries in non-attainment areas to radically alter their activities. For example, in non-attainment areas, the following programs, many of which are still undergoing refinement, are being required:
<UL>
<LI> Under the state's most recent plan to control ozone pollution, automobile owners would be required to have emissions from their vehicles tested every two years. Vehicles that do not meet emission standards would have to be repaired at the owner's expense. However, in 1995, the Texas Legislature passed a statewide moratorium on inspections to reconsider the program. Still, some sort of vehicle emission testing will likely be required in non-attainment areas.
<P><LI> Service stations are required to install equipment to control gasoline vapors at the pump and as fuel is being unloaded into storage tanks. Most stations were to comply by 1994; smaller stations that were built before 1992 and sell less than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month are exempt. 
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area residents will have to use only reformulated gasoline, a cleaner-burning fuel.
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area must reduce the number of cars and trucks commuting to and from work through an employer trip reduction program. The program has been delayed six months by actions of the Legislature and Governor, however.
<P><LI> El Paso residents will have to use oxygenated gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
<P><LI> Specific industries will be required to install pollution-control equipment beyond what is required under current regulations.
<P><LI> Small businesses like dry cleaners, paint shops, printers and autobody shops will have to install pollution-control equipment.
<P><LI> In El Paso, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston/Galveston, industrial wastewater systems will be required to cover wastewater treatment areas and route the vapors through a control device.
<P><LI> All new or expanding major industries in a non-attainment area must apply for non-attainment source review permits, which are more stringent than attainment area permits, known as prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permits.
<P><LI> The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has designated five other metropolitan areas as "near non-attainment" areas. These areas are: Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Victoria, and the Tyler/Longview/Marshall area. They are called near non-attainment because they have on occasion exceeded standards, because they were once non-attainment areas but have since come into compliance, or because of their potential for future growth. In 1993, for example, both Tyler/Longview/Marshall and Corpus Christi exceeded ozone standards for a single day - not enough to cause the cities to go out of compliance, but cause for concern. The state and local officials are working on voluntary programs in these and other cities to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
</UL>
<P>
Because the Clean Air Act limits growth in non-attainment areas by requiring that existing companies offset any new emissions, new industries may be inclined to locate in cities without immediate pollution problems. This growth could cause an increase in emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides in these cities, and could cause them eventually to exceed federal air-quality standards. 
<P>
The criteria pollutants covered by the Federal Clean Air Act are not the only pollutants. Air toxics, greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting chemicals and a wide variety of indoor air particulates are also of great concern.

<A NAME="BINATION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>ACHIEVING CLEAN AIR IS A BINATIONAL PROBLEM FOR EL PASO
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
El Paso is the only city in Texas in violation of national standards for both respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The city is also designated as a "serious" non-attainment area for ozone. El Paso has been in compliance with national standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and, since 1986, with lead standards. 
<P>
El Paso and other cities along the Texas/Mexico border face unique pollution problems because environmental standards differ on the two sides of the border. In fact, air pollution originating in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico - which lies in a desert valley across the Rio Grande River from El Paso - may contribute as much or more to overall air pollution in El Paso than pollution originating on the U.S. side of the border. These two cities, along with Sunland Park, New Mexico, share a common airshed in a valley characterized by the Rio Grande River and surrounding moun-tain peaks. Temperature inversions in the area contribute to air pollution problems. 
<P>
A 1990 joint study by the EPA, Texas Air Control Board, El Paso City/County Health Department and Mexican authorities found that the highest concentrations of particulate matter occurred in urban Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and in the mountain pass along the border.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#43">(43)</A> The principle sources of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and ozone in the area include motor vehicles, industries located in the airshed and open burning of domes-tic and agricultural waste. 
<P>
A problem specific to the area is the large number of vehicles waiting to enter or exit the United States from Mexico. The El Paso - Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez border crossing is one of the busiest crossings along the border. Each vehicle crossing the border, about 40 percent of which have Mexican license plates, must wait at least 10 minutes at the border while their paperwork is processed. Vehicles at idle produce higher emissions. Mexican vehicles, because they are older and often have less stringent maintenance and emission controls, tend to be higher emitters.
<P>
If the TNRCC can prove that pollution emanating from outside the United States prevents El Paso's compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the criteria pollutants - ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter - then the city will not bump up to a severe non-attainment area if the attainment deadlines are not met. This dispensation would also keep the city from suffering federal sanctions including the loss of federal highway funds and construction grants. However, El Paso will still have to adopt stringent pollution control rules to comply with the FCAA.
<P>
For the past two years, state and local officials, environmental groups and business interests from the U.S. and Mexico have been working on the concept of an International Air Quality Management District encompassing the two cities and surrounding areas. Under one proposal, the District would coordinate monitoring and set caps on emissions within the airshed, while also allowing for flexibility to meet these standards. For example, rather than investing in expensive pollution con-trol equipment, new businesses in El Paso might offset their emissions by instead investing in a similar facility in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, or helping pave Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez streets.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#44">(44)</A>

<P>
Air toxics is a term which describes a broad group of non-criteria pollutants including NESHAP pollutants (hazardous air pollutants regulated by National Emission Standards established and enforced by the EPA), workplace pollutants, state-regulated pollutants, toxics compounds covered by the Toxics Release Inventory Program and other toxic pollutants addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act. While total emissions of these compounds are small compared to the criteria air pollutants - they are usually measured in pounds, not tons - their potential impact on human health can be great, especially for individuals living near a source of emissions or a spill release. Upon inhalation, air toxics are brought into the lungs, where some are readily absorbed into the blood stream. Some air toxics can also irritate sensitive tissues in the eyes, throat and nose. Some may cause cancer in humans. Others may cause reproductive dysfunctions, birth defects or nervous system disorders. 
<P>
The 1986 Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act requires businesses to report all releases into the air, water, or ground of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemical compounds. These data are compiled into the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Recently, the EPA added an additional 286 chemicals to the list of chemicals which must be reported by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#45">(45)</A> Texas leads the nation in air toxics releases, accounting in 1992 for about 7.5 percent of all toxic air emissions nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#46">(46)</A> However, between 60 percent and two-thirds of the nation's petrochemical capacity occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#47">(47)</A>
<P>
Industrial toxics emissions are just part of total toxic air emissions. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board estimated that these releases accounted for only 18 percent of total toxic air emissions, while mobile sources - automobiles, motorcycles, pickups, vans and trucks -  accounted for 24 percent. "Area sources" - dry cleaners, solvent and paint shops and wastewater treatment plants among others - emit up to three times the amount of toxics emitted statewide by major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#48">(48)</A> Still, the contribution of total air toxic emissions of each of these categories - industrial, mobile and area sources - varies widely with location.
<P>
The EPA has had the authority to set standards for hazardous air pollutants since 1970. Because of sparse medical data, however, the EPA has faced numerous legal challenges in adopting regulatory measures. Through 1993, the list of NESHAPS - national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants- stood at seven, and included the following chemicals: asbestos, beryllium, arsenic, mercury, benzene, vinyl chloride and radionuclides. 
<P>
In 1990, the new Federal Clean Air Act directed the EPA to control industrial emissions for 189 toxic chemicals with potential effects ranging from chronic respiratory effects to cancer to reproductive dysfunctions. The EPA must designate control-technology standards for 174 types of facilities that emit one or more of the 189 listed hazardous air pollutants. Standards for 39 sources were due by November, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#49">(49)</A> In some cases, EPA will establish the specific type of technology to be used to limit releases of pollutants; in others, industry will have flexibility in determining which type of technology they use to meet emission requirements.  
<P>
For those compounds not classified as criteria pollutants or with national emission standards (NESHAPs), air toxicologists and regulators at the TNRCC have conducted site-specific reviews of predicted or actual impacts for potential adverse effects. "Effects Screening Levels" (ambient air concentration guidelines, or ESLs) are used to gauge the potential of toxics air emissions associated with expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new facility to cause adverse health or welfare effects.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#50">(50)</A> 
<P>
Screening levels are set to protect against health effects, odor nuisance, effects on vegetation or corrosive effects, and are set to protect the more sensitive members of the general public. If, during the permit review process, the TNRCC determines that proposed emissions may result in exposure of the general public outside of the facility to concentrations of air pollutants at levels above these screening levels, the Commission may either deny the permit or require pollution control equipment as a permit provision.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#51">(51)</A> 
<P>
These health-based screening levels are controversial. Since each screening level is based upon the effects of a single chemical, simultaneous exposure to several air pollutants (each of which may have a similar effect on health) may not be adequately addressed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#52">(52)</A> The Toxicology and Risk Assessment Section at the TNRCC are aware of this potential for additive effects, but believe that the ESLs are conservative enough to protect against this effect in the vast majority of cases. In special cases, additional review is conducted as needed.
<P>
Another criticism is that ESLs do not address specifically the potential accumulation in the environment, over time, of compounds like DDTs, PCBs and metals. Although many toxics can degrade or be washed out of the environment in a short time, a few compounds are not readily degraded, and may accumulate in the tissue of lower organisms, then eventually in fish, birds and even mammals such as humans. In the review of impacts of these chemicals, this potential is considered.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#53">(53)</A> 
<P>
While Texas keeps an extensive air toxic emission inventory - how many pounds are actually emitted in the air - there is much less data on levels of toxics in the ambient air. In 1992, the TNRCC established the Community Air Toxics Monitoring Program, a network of 15 monitoring sites that will eventually expand to 50 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#54">(54)</A> The 15 sites have analyzed air samples for 19 volatile organic compounds. In both 1992 and 1993, benzene, a human carcinogen, was the only compound consistently detected at levels above the effects screening levels, and was detected at eight of the 15 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
The TNRCC determined, however, that the benzene measurements that exceeded the 24-hour ESLs would not increase the risk of short term adverse health effects. The TNRCC further concluded that, while long-term exposure to benzene at levels significantly greater than the annual ESL may increase the lifetime risk of developing leukemia or affect the formation of blood, measured levels of benzene have significantly decreased over the past 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#56">(56)</A> 
<P>
Benzene is a constituent of gasoline; it is released from cars during refueling and is a component of car exhaust. Benzene is also released during industrial refining processes and from benzene storage tanks. In Texas, the counties along the Gulf Coast have the greatest number of sources of benzene because of the large number of petrochemical companies and petroleum refineries.
<P>
Another compound - 1,2 dibromoethane - exceeded its screening levels at two sites in Houston, and at sites in El Paso and Midlothian during the monitoring period running from October 1992 through September 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#57">(57)</A> It is released to the atmosphere primarily through its use as a pesticide and as a fuel additive for gasoline. The manufacture of 1,2 dibromoethane has declined in recent years because its use as a fumigant has been banned and because the decline in lead-content of gasoline has resulted in a decline in its use as a fuel additive. While 24-hour concentrations did exceed the established ESL standards at these sites, they were not high enough to result in acute health effects according to TNRCC criteria. Nonetheless, yearly screening levels were exceeded.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#58">(58)</A>
<P>
The TNRCC, partly in response to legislative and citizen concerns about potential health effects of air toxics, has initiated special purpose studies at several sites around Texas. For example, after noticing high levels of arsenic in ambient air analyses in El Paso, the state initiated a special study in 1993 near the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). The Vilas Elementary School, about two miles southwest of the plant, was the site chosen for the study. The study showed that arsenic levels consistently exceeded both the annual and 24-hour screening levels. By comparing test results to levels measured when the ASARCO plant was shut down for a strike in 1980, the state concluded that the high arsenic levels were because of plant activity. During a permit hearing, the company agreed to reduce arsenic emissions by a factor of ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<H4>
<A NAME="GREEN">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</A>
</H4>
<P>
One reason the earth is warm enough to support life is that carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere act as a kind of transparent umbrella, allowing sunlight to pass through, then trapping the heat below. This intricate but natural process is known as the greenhouse effect. 
<P>
With increased burning of coal, oil, and natural gas over the past century and with the destruction of much of the earth's forest cover, the greenhouse effect may be intensifying. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, some of which is used by trees and other vegetation during photosynthesis and some of which is absorbed by the oceans. When vast amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced and less is being used by plants, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. This accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (methane, ozone, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons) in earth's atmosphere may be causing the average temperature around the globe to rise, a phenomenon referred to as "global warming."
<P>
The environmental implications of global warming are serious. Higher average temperatures could hasten melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and distorting rainfall patterns. Coastal cities and plant and animal habitat could be destroyed. An alteration of climate could also reduce crop production. However, there may also be some benefits derived. 
<P>
Scientists like James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute, believe that the Earth is already experiencing an enhanced greenhouse effect. For example, six of the hottest years in recorded history occurred in the last decade.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#60">(60)</A> And studies have shown a correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a rise in global temperature.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#61">(61)</A>
<P>
There is considerable debate about the phenomenon of global warming. Critics like Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe while carbon dioxide accumulation may lead to warming climates, the actual impacts of warming will be mitigated by other factors. For instance, the increase in soot, sulfuric acid and particulate matter in the atmosphere, which help scatter light away from the earth, may be counteracting temperature increases that would otherwise occur from the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Still other scientists believe that temperature fluctuations are a normal occurence, attributable to such events as sun spots, and that techniques for measuring temperature are not accurate enough to permit scientists to design proper models of global temperature. Other scientists have developed climactic models which indicate a movement toward a severe cooling period. 
<P>
Overall, global temperatures have increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 130 years. But the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Meteorological Society have both projected that by the year 2050, the average surface temperature will increase an additional 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#62">(62)</A> The effects of these increases would be felt unevenly around the globe, with temperature changing less at the equator than at higher latitudes.
<P>
To delay or prevent global warming, world and national leaders have called for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, to be accomplished through a shift away from the use of oil, gas and coal and toward the use of more renewable energy sources like solar power.
<P>
In Texas, climatic changes predicted as a result of global warming could profoundly alter how Texans live and work. In Dallas, for example, if IPCC predictions are true, the number of days when the temperature reaches 100 degrees F could increase from 19 to 78 per year by 2050. In central Texas, average temperatures could go up five degrees during the same period.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#63">(63)</A> Water levels would also be affected. Rainfall would decline in most areas and the hotter temperatures would increase the rate of evaporation, resulting in a reduced water supply. Coastal areas would likely face more intense rainfall, however, as clouds forming from increased evaporation of ocean waters gave rise to more violent storms. Low-level areas along the coast would be subject to more flooding from increased rainfall and rising sea levels.
<P>
Texas may, however, also derive some positive benefits from warmer annual temperatures. One of these effects is that milder winters may reduce the risk of freezes which cripple citrus crops.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#64">(64)</A> 
<P>
Although there are currently no guidelines or limits in international law relating to greenhouse gases other than CFCs, there is growing awareness that the problem must be addressed. Many of the nations that are signatories to the Montreal Protocol are currently discussing the possibility of an international "law of the atmosphere" that would establish limits on the release of several greenhouse gases<B>.</B><A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
With only 5 percent of the world's population, the United States produces 23.4 percent of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels. Texas alone produces more carbon dioxide than either the United Kingdom or Canada.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#66">(66)</A> The state emitted an estimated 550 million metric tons in 1988 from all sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>

Texas depends heavily on fossil fuels both to power cars and to generate electricity. Texas utilities, for example, contributed 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1991, or about 30 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted. Without major changes in how Texas produces its energy, these levels are expected to continue. For a full discussion of energy use and energy policy in Texas, see the section entitled "Energy."

	<LI>  Most of the sun's energy reaches the Earth.  (The ozone layer shields the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.) 
	<LI>  About 30 percent of the energy is reflected back into space. 
	<LI>  Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Added to this are chloroflourocarbons (man-made gases used in spray cans, refrigerants and insulations) and methane (from landfills, farming and swamps). 
	<LI>  Together, these gases form a "blanket" which traps energy, thus warming the Earth.

<A NAME="STRATO">DECREASING STRATOSPHERIC OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
Chlorinated fluorocarbons, or CFCs is the name given to a family of chemicals developed in 1928 by DuPont under the name Freon. Today, CFCs are used for refrigeration and air conditioning, as well as in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, computer chips, and many other products. When released into the air, these chemicals eventually rise to the stratosphere where they are broken down by sunlight. This degradation process releases chlorine, which damages the layer of atmospheric ozone that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet-B radiation. The destructive influence of CFCs high in the atmosphere is significant: a single chlorine atom can lead to the destruction of more than 100,000 ozone molecules.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#68">(68)</A>
<P>
Destruction of the ozone layer appears to be increasing. In the spring of 1985, British scientists found a hole about the size of the continental U.S. in the ozone layer over the Antarctica. This hole has reappeared each spring when meteorological conditions facilitate the breakdown in ozone. In 1992, satellite images recorded global ozone levels 4 percent lower than normal. Meanwhile, the concentration of CFCs measured in the atmo-sphere continues to climb.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#69">(69)</A> Use of other "ozone-depleters" like halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs) has also been on the rise.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#70">(70)</A> The high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth as a result of ozone depletion have been shown to increase the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. This radiation also adversely affects the environment. 
<P>
Because of the danger CFCs pose to the ozone layer, the Clean Air Act requires a phase-out of the production of CFCs and halons by the year 2000. Interim substitutes, such as HCFCs, will also be eventually phased out. In Texas, major industries still release millions of pounds of ten chemicals EPA has identified as ozone-depleters. Still, most CFCs do not come from industrial sources but rather from refrigerants, automobile air conditioning and solvents in oil-based paints.

<A NAME="INDOOR">INDOOR AIR POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The air we breathe indoors, whether at home, in our cars or at work, may represent a bigger pollution problem than outdoor air pollution. With people spending up to 90 percent of their time indoors, the quantity and severity of health problems related to indoor air quality has probably increased over the last 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#71">(71)</A> For example, in a December 1989 report, the EPA compared the risks of 20 different environmental problems and found that indoor air pollution posed the greatest health risk, though it had the least amount of federal money dedicated to it.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#72">(72)</A>
<P>
The severity of indoor air pollution is aggravated by the fact that new buildings are being built more tightly to save money spent on heating and cooling. Because these tightly sealed, more energy efficient buildings prevent the exchange of outside/inside air, they reduce the amount of fresh air in a building. At the same time, people are using more and more irritating products such as hair sprays, pesticides and cleaning detergents. The combination of a lack of ventilation and heavy use of such materials can be dangerous. In Texas, the Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch is responsible for responding to indoor air-quality complaints, providing on-site investigations, educating the public about indoor air quality health problems and suggesting methods to alleviate indoor air quality problems.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> During FY 1992, the Texas Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch received over 3,000 requests for information, responded to indoor air-quality complaints from 124 schools, buildings and residences, and performed more than 257 on-site investigations, including 130 private residences. For more information, please call the Occupational Health Division at the Department of Health at 512-834-6600.

<P>
The American Lung Association has estimated that indoor air pollution costs businesses over $100 billion dollars a year because of death, sick days, direct medical costs, loss of productivity and damage to materials and equipment. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that 3,500 to 6,500 deaths a year are the result of the effects of indoor air pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#73">(73)</A> The causes of these deaths include cancer and coronary heart disease caused by exposure to radon, paints, solvents and second-hand tobacco smoke. 
<P>
Indoor air pollution is suspected to be one of the leading causes of health problems largely because of seven pollutants: environmental tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, radon, microorganisms, pesticides, asbestos and lead. In 1989, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly asked an independent team of scientists known as the Science Advisory Board to assess and compare different environmental risks using recent scientific data. The group found that indoor air quality problems from environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, radon and six volatile organic compounds often found indoors in solvents, paints and gasoline products represented one of four problems posing "relatively high human health risks."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#74">(74)</A>
<P>
Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is responsible for an estimated 10 percent of lung cancer deaths. This colorless, odorless gas occurs everywhere at low levels, but it becomes a concern when it is trapped in buildings with little ventilation. Radon gas may enter homes built on soils or rocks containing high levels of uranium, which is the most common source of the gas, or through cracks or other openings in basements or ground floors. Studies by the EPA indicate that as many as 10 percent of U.S. homes may have elevated radon levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#75">(75)</A> A 1992 study by the TDH monitored indoor air for radon in about 2,700 homes across Texas. The TDH found four areas with a high potential for radon: the West Texas Panhandle Region; the Big Bend area; the Llano Uplift area; and inland from the coastal bend in South Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
Microorganisms - bacteria, viruses and fungi - can cause serious illnesses such as Legionnaire's Disease, asthma, influenza and other infectious diseases.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#77">(77)</A> These microorganisms can grow in humid buildings, as well as in bedding or the litter of household pets, and without proper ventilation, can easily infect occupants. More subtle health effects, commonly known as "sick building syndrome," include headaches, irritation of eyes, nose and respiratory tract, loss of memory, fatigue and drowsiness. An EPA survey of office workers across the nation found that 19 percent of respondents sometimes had difficulty performing work because of poor indoor air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#78">(78)</A>
<P>
Indoor exposure to pesticides, asbestos and lead all affect human health, particularly the health of young children. The practice of sanding or open-flame burning of lead-based paints, which were in common use before 1978, emits compounds that can impair mental and physical development in both fetuses and young children. Using 1990 census data, the EPA determined that 3.5 million homes in Texas contain some lead-based paint. Based upon these figures, the EPA estimates that 1,949,696 children six years old or under have the potential to be exposed to lead poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Pesticides in the home or office can irritate eyes, nose and throat and may damage the central nervous system or may even lead to an increased risk of cancer. According to an EPA survey, nine out of ten U.S. households have used pesticides.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#80">(80)</A> Chlordane, dieldrin and other chemicals used to kill termites have been banned or their indoor use severely restricted in part because they remain active for such long periods. Also, several types of asbestos products, made from a mineral fiber used as an insulator and fire-retardant, have been banned by the EPA because they can cause chest and lung cancer as well as a condition known as asbestosis, an irreversible lung scarring which can be fatal.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#81">(81)</A> Elevated concentrations of asbestos can occur indoors when asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by remodeling or demolition activities.
<P>

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  An EPA study indicates that nearly 90 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors.
