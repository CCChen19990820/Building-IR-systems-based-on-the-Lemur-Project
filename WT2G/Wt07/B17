WebChat is an experimental program.  Please be patient.  If you want to 
see it improved, send us comments (please) to <A 
HREF="mailto:webchat@irsociety.com">webchat@irsociety.com</a><p>

Some IMPORTANT usage notes:<br>
Because WebChat allows display of pictures from around the world, it is 
always possible that a picture is unavailable when your browser tries to 
get it.  If your browser seems to hang, that is probably why.  You can 
proceed by pressing the STOP button - in most cases you'll get all the 
text, just not all the pictures.  Also, if someone sent a huge picture 
that you don't want to wait for, STOP will help you there as well.

Please be respectful of others - try not to send huge inline .gifs. 
Thanks!<p>

To get more messages, press the CHAT button; not your browser's Reload 
button.<p>

To put a .gif or hyperlink in your message, type the address of the
destination, but don't use HTML markup language.  Example: <p>
Right: http://www.irsociety.com/Welcome.html<br>
Wrong: ..A HREF="http://www.irsociety.com/Welcome.html>...<p>

5) The numbers following some of the board names are network addresses
   for those boards participating in the International Fido Network.
   A plus sign (+) indicates the board is new or updated with this listing <P>

6)  Took a new job, but always looking for new possibilities.  Anyone need
    a radiologist with a lot of computer and telecommunications know how??? <P>
 
7)  If you have read this far you can be of a great help.  This
    list is updated about every 6 months.  The next update will be
    released on August 25, 1994. The list is widely distributed
    but as I call these boards I see that many have lists that
    are many months to years old.  You can be of great service to
    me and the BBS community in general if you would take the
    time and effort to upload this list to at least one BBS in
    your area.  Also, please tell the sysops of systems you call that
    you heard of their board from the BLACK BAG list!!!<BR><BR>

<B>SPECIAL NOTE:</B</P>
Sysops:
     As someone recently told me... I've been doing this
     since Fido was a pup.  As always I thank you for your support,
     criticism and additions over the last 8 years. Please keep it up!!!<P>

     Finally, if you run one of the boards in this list you can
     be of great help in keeping it up to date by maintaining my
     password even though I may call only every two to three
     months.  By doing so you will help save me a great deal of
     time and money.  Thanks !!!<P><BR>

<BODY><H1>Counseling to Prevent Tobacco Use </H1>
<PRE>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recommendation
 
Tobacco cessation counseling should be offered on a regular 
basis to all patients who smoke cigarettes, pipes, or 
cigars, and to those who use smokeless tobacco.  The 
prescription of nicotine gum may be an appropriate adjunct 
for some patients.  Adolescents and young adults who do not 
currently use tobacco products should be advised not to 
start (see Clinical Intervention).
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Smoking accounts for one out of every six deaths in the 
United States.1  It is the most important modifiable cause 
of death.2,3  Each year, 390,000 Americans die as a result 
of smoking.3  Over 130,000 of these deaths are due to 
smoking-related cancers.  In adult men, smoking accounts 
for 90% of all deaths from cancer of the lung, trachea, and 
bronchus; 92% of deaths from cancers of the lip, oral 
cavity, and pharynx; 80% of deaths from cancer of the 
larynx; 78% of deaths from esophageal cancer; 48% of deaths 
from cancer of the kidney; 47% of deaths from bladder 
cancer; 29% of deaths from pancreatic cancer; and 17% of 
deaths from stomach cancer.1,3  Smoking is also responsible 
for over 115,000 deaths each year from coronary heart 
disease and 27,500 deaths due to cerebrovascular disease.3  
Smoking accounts for nearly 60,000 deaths per year from 
pulmonary diseases such as chronic airway obstruction.3  
Smoking during pregnancy is responsible for about 18% of 
all cases of low birthweight, shortened gestation, 
respiratory distress syndrome, and sudden infant death 
syndrome.1  Involuntary, or passive, smoking accounts for 
an estimated 3800 nonsmoker deaths each year from lung 
cancer.4  Cigarettes are also responsible for about 1500 
fire-related deaths and 4000 injuries each year.5,6  The 
total direct and indirect costs of smoking may be as high 
as $200 billion per year.7
 
Although smoking has become less common in recent years, 
nearly one-third of all adults in the United States 
continue to smoke.8  Cigarette smoking is more common among 
blacks and persons of low socioeconomic status.  Due to an 
increase in smoking by women during the period between 1940 
and the early 1960s, lung cancer mortality in females has 
been rising steadily since the mid-1960s; lung cancer 
recently replaced breast cancer as the chief cause of 
cancer death in women.9  Over three-quarters of smokers 
begin smoking as teenagers.  Currently, one out of five 
high school seniors smokes on a daily basis, and one-third 
of persons aged 20-24 are current smokers.8,10  Between 25% 
and 40% of female smokers do not quit smoking during 
pregnancy.11,12  Smokeless tobacco, a leading cause of oral 
cancer, is used by over 10 million Americans.13,14  Between 
8% and 36% of male high school and college students are 
regular users of smokeless tobacco.15   Efficacy of Risk 
Reduction
 
Beginning with early studies in the 1950s and 1960s, a 
large body of epidemiologic evidence has accumulated 
regarding the health effects of smoking.  Major cohort 
studies, a large number of case-control studies, and other 
data sources have since provided consistent evidence 
linking the use of tobacco with a variety of serious 
pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases.  The 
scope of this report does not permit an examination of each 
study of the health effects of smoking, or the nature of 
the risk relationship (e.g., relative risk, dose-response 
relationship) between smoking and each disease.  Detailed 
reviews of this literature have been published 
elsewhere.1,3,7,16-18  
Several consistent findings from this body of evidence are 
well established.  First, tobacco is one of the most potent 
of human carcinogens.  The majority of all cancers of the 
lung, trachea, bronchus, larynx, pharynx, oral cavity, and 
esophagus are attributable to the use of smoked or 
smokeless tobacco.  Smoking also accounts for a significant 
but smaller proportion of cancers of the pancreas, kidney, 
bladder, and stomach.  Second, smoking promotes 
atherosclerosis.  Along with hypertension and 
hypercholesterolemia, smoking is one of the leading risk 
factors for myocardial infarction and coronary artery 
disease, and it accounts for up to 30% of all coronary 
events.  Smoking is also a risk factor for cerebrovascular 
disease and peripheral vascular disease.  Third, smoking 
causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and it is an 
important risk factor for other respiratory illnesses such 
as pneumonia and influenza.  Fourth, smoking can affect the 
health of nonsmokers.  Involuntary smoking can increase the 
risk of lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers and the frequency 
of respiratory illness among children.  In utero exposure 
to maternal smoking increases the risk of miscarriage, 
stillbirth, low birthweight, and retarded growth.  Finally, 
cigarettes are responsible for about 25% of deaths from 
residential fires.  

There is also a large body of evidence from prospective 
studies that many of these health risks can be reduced by 
stopping smoking.  Over a period of 15-20 years, the 
ex-smoker's risk of dying from lung cancer decreases 
gradually to a risk that is comparable to that of 
nonsmokers'.19,20  Similarly, a large number of cohort 
studies of persons with atherosclerotic heart disease have 
demonstrated that the risk of subsequent myocardial 
infarction is reduced significantly among persons who stop 
smoking.  These cardiovascular benefits of smoking 
cessation have been well demonstrated among the young,21 
and recent evidence suggests that risk is also reduced even 
among persons who stop smoking after age 55.22  

Effectiveness of Counseling
 
Clinicians have both the opportunity and the means to 
modify smoking behavior in patients.  It has been estimated 
that about 38 million of the 53 million adult smokers in 
the United States could potentially be reached by 
physicians during the course of ongoing medical care.23  
Moreover, a number of clinical trials24-29 have 
demonstrated the effectiveness of certain forms of 
physician counseling in changing the smoking behavior of 
patients.  As many as 40 controlled clinical trials have 
examined different types of clinical smoking cessation 
techniques involving various combinations of counseling, 
distribution of literature, and nicotine replacement 
therapy.30,31  These studies have found that effectiveness 
depends on a variety of factors, such as the number of 
contacts with the patient, the number of months of 
intervention, the use of personal face-to-face advice, and 
the type of counselor.  Characteristics of the patient, 
such as level of nicotine dependence, personal motivation 
to stop smoking, and confidence in the ability to quit, are 
also critical variables.32  Although some studies have 
reported a 40-50% increase in smoking cessation as a result 
of clinical intervention, a recent meta-analysis of 39 
clinical trials found that differences in cessation rates 
of unselected patients who receive treatment average about 
8% after six months and 6% after one year.30  The most 
effective techniques are those involving more than one 
modality (e.g., physician advice, self-help materials), 
those that involve both physicians and nonphysicians, and 
those that provide the greatest number of motivational 
messages for the longest period of time.30  The key 
elements of effective counseling appear to be providing 
reinforcement through consistent and repeated advice to 
stop smoking, setting a specific "quit date," and 
scheduling a follow-up contact or visit.30,33  Providing 
self-help materials along with counseling appears to 
further enhance the effectiveness of physician 
advice.24,34
 
In addition to counseling, the prescription of nicotine gum 
can facilitate smoking cessation.  A number of randomized 
controlled trials support the efficacy of nicotine 
replacement therapy, especially for highly 
nicotine-dependent smokers.25,26,31,32,35,36  The evidence 
suggests, however, that nicotine gum is not effective in 
isolation but rather as an adjunct to ongoing smoking 
cessation counseling.37  When used correctly and when 
combined with physician advice to stop smoking, nicotine 
gum may increase long-term smoking cessation rates by about 
one-third.38  It is contraindicated in pregnant and nursing 
women, in persons with recent myocardial infarction, and in 
those with temporomandibular joint disease.  It may also 
have adverse effects in persons with peptic ulcer disease, 
claudication, hypertension, arrhythmias, and diabetes.39  
Some patients may use the gum without discontinuing 
smoking, thereby increasing the risk of nicotine toxicity, 
while others may continue to chew the gum for more than a 
year.40  Clonidine is another drug of potential value as an 
adjunct in treating nicotine withdrawal,41 but further 
studies are needed before smoking cessation becomes an 
approved indication for this drug.  There are few studies 
supporting the adjunctive use of anxiolytics and 
antidepressants in the treatment of smoking cessation. The 
primary prevention of tobacco use in adolescents who do not 
smoke or use smokeless tobacco is an increasingly important 
role for the clinician.  The use of tobacco as a teenager 
is an important risk factor for long-term nicotine 
dependence.42  The clinician has an opportunity to 
intervene by providing information on the health effects 
and addictive potential of tobacco and by providing the 
adolescent with incentives and skills to resist peer 
pressure to use tobacco.  Early results from programs 
providing this form of counseling suggest that the use of 
tobacco can be prevented in at least some teenagers,43,44 
but there are no data from prospective studies regarding 
the effectiveness of physicians in achieving these 
outcomes.  

Recommendations of Others
 
Official recommendations for physicians to encourage 
smoking cessation have been made by the American College of 
Physicians,45,46 the American Academy of Family 
Physicians,47 the American Academy of Pediatrics,48 the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,49 the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,50,51 the 
National Cancer Insititute,52 and many other medical 
organizations and agencies.  Specific recommendations 
regarding the use of smokeless tobacco have been issued by 
the American Academy of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck 
Surgery,53 the American Academy of Oral Medicine, the 
American Medical Association, and the American Dental 
Association.54
 
Discussion
 
Although the significant health benefits of smoking 
cessation are well established, studies suggest that many 
physicians fail to advise smokers to quit.55,56  This 
reluctance to intervene may be the result of a number of 
variables, including lack of confidence in the ability to 
provide adequate counseling, skepticism about the ability 
to achieve behavior change through counseling, and concerns 
about the effectiveness of devoting time to smoking 
cessation during the clinical encounter.  As mentioned 
above, however, a number of studies have shown that 
physician counseling can change behavior, even when the 
advice consists of a relatively simple message.  Moreover, 
even a modest effect on smoking rates can have significant 
public health implications when multiplied by the estimated 
38 million smokers seen annually by U.S. physicians.  
Cost-effectiveness studies also support the clinical value 
of offering smoking cessation counseling during the routine 
office visit of patients who smoke.57
 
Clinical Intervention
 
A complete history of tobacco use should be obtained on all 
adolescent and adult patients.  Smoking cessation 
counseling should be offered on a regular basis to all 
patients who smoke cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, or use 
smokeless tobacco.  Persons who do not currently use 
tobacco but who are at increased risk of adopting such 
behavior (e.g., adolescents) should be advised to resist 
pressure to begin smoking or using smokeless tobacco.  The 
optimal frequency for performing smoking cessation 
counseling has not been determined with certainty and is 
left to clinical discretion.  Pregnant women and parents 
with young children should receive information on the 
potential harmful effects of smoking on fetal and child 
health.  Certain strategies can increase the effectiveness 
of counseling regarding tobacco use:
 
Direct, face-to-face advice and suggestions:  The most 
effective physician message is a brief, unambiguous, and 
informative statement on the need to stop using tobacco.  
If possible, the clinician should also review the short- 
and long-term health, social, and economic benefits of 
quitting and foster the smoker's belief in the ability to 
stop.  The message should address the patient's concerns 
and any barriers presented by age, social environment, 
nicotine dependence, and general health.  The physician 
should try to get agreement on a specific "quit date" and 
should prepare the patient for withdrawal symptoms.  
Patients who have experienced a relapse after previously 
quitting should be reassured that most smokers achieve 
long-term cessation only after several unsuccessful 
attempts.
 
Scheduled reinforcement:  Scheduled "support visits" or 
follow-up telephone calls, especially during the first four 
to eight weeks, make cessation more effective.  Use of a 
register system for smokers increases the probability that 
a smoking message is delivered at each visit.
 
Self-help materials:  Clinicians can dispense a variety of 
effective self-help packages to aid the majority of smokers 
who quit on their own.  These materials are available from 
voluntary organizations in most communities.
 
Referral to community programs:  Local hospitals, health 
departments, community health centers, worksites, 
commercial services, and voluntary organizations frequently 
offer smoking cessation programs to which patients can be 
referred.  However, clinicians should not refer patients to 
programs providing treatment of unproven efficacy (e.g., 
electric shock therapy, chemical treatment).58
 
Drug therapy:  When coupled with other interventions, the 
prescription of nicotine gum may facilitate cessation by 
relieving withdrawal symptoms.  Patients should be provided 
with information on the  proper use of nicotine gum.59 
Specifically, smokers should be advised to stop smoking 
completely before starting to use the gum and should be 
instructed to chew the gum slowly and intermittently to 
allow proper absorption by the buccal mucosa.  The gum 
should be used as needed for at least three months, when 
the risk of relapse is greatest, but it is not recommended 
for use beyond six months.

<BODY><H1>Counseling to Prevent Motor Vehicle Injuries  </H1> 
<PRE>
Recommendation:
 
All patients should be urged to use occupant restraints 
(safety belts and child safety seats) for themselves and 
others, to wear safety helmets when riding motorcycles, and 
to refrain from driving while under the influence of 
alcohol or other drugs (see Clinical Intervention). The 
prevention of bicycle injuries is discussed in Chapter 52.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Injuries are the fourth leading cause of death in the 
United States and the leading cause of death in persons 
under age 45. Motor vehicle injuries account for about half 
of these deaths.1 In 1986, nearly 48,000 Americans died in 
motor vehicle crashes, and each year several million suffer 
nonfatal injuries.1-3 Over 3100 children under age 15 died 
in motor vehicle crashes in 1986.4 Motor vehicle injuries 
occur most commonly in males and in persons aged 15-24.5 
This age group has the highest mortality rate and accounts 
for one-third of all deaths from motor vehicle crashes in 
the United States.1 Motor vehicles crashes are the leading 
cause of death in persons aged 5-24; in 1986 they accounted 
for 38% of all deaths in young persons aged 15-24.1 The 
risk of motor vehicle crashes is also increased for persons 
over age 60, but elderly motorists account for only 10% of 
fatal crashes, primarily because they drive less than 
younger persons.6
 
Only 46% of Americans use seat belts7 and, in 1986, 1.7 
million persons were arrested for alcohol-impaired 
driving.4 About 40% of persons killed in motor vehicle 
crashes are intoxicated by alcohol.4 In 1987, an estimated 
23,630 persons were killed in alcohol-related motor vehicle 
crashes, accounting for about 7% of the total years of 
potential life lost before age 65 in the United States 
during that year.8 The proportion of fatally injured 
drivers having illegally high blood alcohol concentrations 
(BAC) is highest for those aged 20-34.9,10
 
Efficacy of Risk Reduction
 
Driving while intoxicated and failing to use occupant 
protection (e.g., safety belts, child safety seats) are two 
important personal behaviors that increase the risk of 
motor vehicle injury. Several crash studies have found that 
about half of fatally injured drivers have BACs of 0.10% by 
weight (the legal limit in most states) or higher.3,11 
Controlled studies have shown that fatally injured drivers 
are more likely to have a BAC of at least 0.10% than are 
drivers who are not killed.12,13 In addition to its role as 
a risk factor for causing motor vehicle crashes, alcohol 
intoxication increases the risk of death or serious injury 
during and after a crash,14,15 and it can limit the ability 
of the victim to escape from the vehicle.11,14 
Alcohol-intoxicated survivors with severe brain injuries 
appear to have longer hospitalizations and more persistent 
neurologic impairment than those who are not intoxicated.16 
Intoxication by drugs other than alcohol, such as 
benzodiazepines, narcotics, amphetamines, barbiturates, 
cocaine, and marijuana, has also been documented in motor 
vehicle crash victims, but most studies have been unable to 
separate the effects of these drugs from those of 
alcohol.17 It has been estimated, however, that about 
10-20% of motor vehicle crashes are associated with drugs 
other than alcohol.18
 
Use of occupant protection systems has been shown to reduce 
the risk of motor vehicle injury by about 40-50%. The 
effectiveness of safety belts has been demonstrated in a 
variety of study designs that include laboratory 
experiments (using human volunteers, cadavers, and 
anthropomorphic crash dummies), postcrash comparisons of 
injuries sustained by restrained and unrestrained 
occupants, and postcrash judgments by crash analysts 
regarding the probable effects of restraints had they been 
used.19 It has been estimated on the basis of such evidence 
that the proper use of lap and shoulder belts can decrease 
the risk of moderate to serious injury to front seat 
occupants by 45-55%20,21 and can reduce crash mortality by 
40-50%.20 When brought to the hospital, crash victims who 
are wearing safety belts at the time of the crash have less 
severe injuries, are less likely to require admission, and 
have lower hospital charges.22
 
Child safety seats also appear to be effective. It has been 
reported that unrestrained children are over 10 times as 
likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than are restrained 
children,23,24 although these data come from studies with 
important design limitations. Other studies suggest that 
child safety seats can reduce serious injury by 67% and 
mortality by 71%.25 A 20-25% decline in head and extremity 
injuries for children under age 4 has been reported in 
states with mandatory child restraint legislation.26 Child 
restraints may also reduce noncrash injuries to child 
passengers by preventing falls both within and out of the 
vehicle.27
 
By wearing safety helmets, persons who operate or ride on 
motorcycles can reduce their risk of injury or death from 
head trauma in the event of a crash. In states where their 
use is required by law, such helmets have been shown to 
reduce mortality by about 30%.2 Head injury rates are 
reduced by about 75% among motorcyclists who wear safety 
helmets.28 States that have repealed mandatory motorcycle 
helmet laws have experienced significant increases in 
motorcycle fatalities.29
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
The use of occupant protection systems has increased in 
recent years. From 1978 to 1988, the overall use of seat 
belts rose from under 13% to about 46%.7 Nonetheless, most 
Americans, and presumably most patients seen by physicians, 
do not use occupant protection systems when driving or 
riding in a motor vehicle. Similarly, although the rate of 
alcohol-related driver fatalities has decreased slightly in 
recent years, as many as 1.7 million persons continue to be 
arrested annually for alcohol-impaired driving.4 Thus, it 
is likely that many patients seen by clinicians could 
potentially benefit from counseling to modify their 
behaviors as drivers and passengers in motor vehicles. 
Since motor vehicle crashes represent a leading cause of 
death and nonfatal injury in the United States, even modest 
successes through clinical interventions could have major 
public health value.
 
In actual practice, however, it is not known how 
effectively clinicians can alter these behaviors. Although 
there is some evidence that persons involved in motor 
vehicle crashes while intoxicated demonstrate lower 
recidivism in alcohol treatment interventions30 and that 
community interventions to reduce alcohol-impaired driving 
may be effective,31 there is generally little information 
from clinical studies on the ability of physicians to 
influence patients to refrain from driving while 
intoxicated. Similarly, there have been few studies 
examining the effectiveness of physician counseling to use 
safety belts. In one questionnaire survey, patients claimed 
to have increased their use of safety belts as a result of 
a brief statement by their physician during a routine 
office visit,32 but the study lacked controls and the 
patients were carefully selected. Other measures that have 
been proved successful in motivating persons to use safety 
belts, such as community educational programs and intensive 
psychological strategies, may not be generalizable to the 
clinical practice setting.33
 
The strongest evidence that clinician counseling can be 
effective comes from programs that encouraged parents to 
use infant safety seats before this practice became widely 
mandated by state law. Results from such programs suggest 
that significant short-term improvements are possible 
immediately after newborns are discharged, but the effect 
is rarely maintained for more than a few months.34-37 A 
nonrandomized controlled trial found that the combined 
intervention of pediatrician counseling, a prescription for 
an infant restraint, and a pamphlet on crash protection was 
associated with increased correct use when compared with 
controls for the first two monthly well-baby visits.37 A 
study in which nurses conducted educational sessions in the 
prenatal period, postpartum period, and at two-month 
intervals after discharge found that proper use of child 
safety seats had improved compared with rates in the 
previous year.38 A small randomized study demonstrated that 
a loaner seat and instruction by a nurse resulted in 
increased correct use at discharge, but no difference in 
use after two to four weeks.39 The same researchers in a 
subsequent trial found that a comprehensive hospital 
program combined with recent state legislation was 
effective in improving correct usage, but intensive 
counseling from pediatricians and nurses was of no 
additional benefit.40 Another controlled study found that 
personal discussion was of limited value; a subgroup 
receiving free infant restraints and literature 
demonstrated slightly higher correct usage at discharge, 
but there was no significant difference between the groups 
in two to four months.41 A randomized controlled trial 
involving parents of children aged 1 to 17 found no 
difference in the use of occupant protection in groups 
receiving various combinations of pamphlets, pediatrician 
counseling, and a slide show.42 Finally, a study found that 
pediatrician counseling resulted in an immediate increase 
in safety belt use, but there was no difference in usage 
rates between the study group and controls at a one-year 
follow-up.43
 
Recommendations of Others
 
The use of safety belts and child safety seats is widely 
recommended by organizations and agencies concerned with 
injury prevention. Child safety seat use is required by law 
in all 50 states. Mandatory safety belt laws are in effect 
in 31 states and the District of Columbia.44 
Recommendations specifically urging physicians to counsel 
patients to use occupant restraints have been issued by a 
number of organizations, including the American Medical 
Association,45 the American College of Physicians,46 and 
the American Academy of Family Physicians.47 The National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also urged 
physicians and other health care providers to routinely 
advise patients about the importance of safety belts and 
the use of child safety seats.44 The American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) recommends counseling parents of infants 
and preschool children to use child safety seats and safety 
belts48 and has instituted special parent-oriented 
educational programs (Make Every Ride A Safe Ride'') in 
which pediatricians encourage the use of child occupant 
protection beginning with the ride home from the hospital 
and continuing throughout childhood. The AAP also 
recommends counseling adolescents to abstain from 
intoxicants when driving; advising parents and children to 
discuss the proper use of alcohol at teen parties; and 
suggesting alternatives to driving while intoxicated or 
riding in a vehicle operated by an intoxicated driver.49 In 
addition, most states prohibit the purchase or possession 
of alcohol by persons under the age of 21.50 
Recommendations for the use of passenger restraints by both 
children and pregnant women have been issued by the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.51
 
Discussion
 
In summary, there is good evidence that persons who use 
occupant protection or avoid driving while intoxicated are 
at significantly decreased risk of injury or death from 
motor vehicle crashes. The evidence is less extensive that 
counseling by clinicians to adopt these practices is 
effective in changing the behavior of motorists or 
passengers. However, since motor vehicle injury represents 
one of the leading causes of death in the United States and 
years of potential life lost, interventions of even modest 
effectiveness are likely to have enormous public health 
implications.
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Clinicians should regularly urge their patients to use 
safety belts whenever driving or riding in an automobile. 
Operators of vehicles carrying infants and toddlers should 
be urged to install and regularly use federally approved 
child safety seats in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions and the child's size. Vehicle operators should 
be urged to use safety belts for children who have outgrown 
safety seats. Children should not be permitted to ride in 
the cargo area of station wagons, vans, or pickup trucks. 
Those who operate or ride on motorcycles should be 
counseled to wear safety helmets (recommendations for 
bicyclists appear in Chapter 52). All patients should be 
counseled regarding the dangers of operating a motor 
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other 
drugs, as well as on the risks of riding in a vehicle 
operated by someone who is under the influence of these 
substances. Adolescents and young adults in particular 
should be encouraged to avoid using alcohol or other drugs 
when driving is anticipated and to discuss with their 
families transportation alternatives for social activities 
where alcohol and other drugs are used. The optimal 
frequency for counseling patients about motor vehicle 
injury has not been determined and is left to clinical 
discretion. Counseling is most important for those at 
increased risk of motor vehicle injury, such as adolescents 
and young adults, persons who use alcohol or other drugs, 
and patients with medical conditions that may impair motor 
vehicle safety.

<PRE>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Recommendation:
 
Patients who use alcohol or other drugs should be warned 
against engaging in potentially dangerous activities while 
intoxicated. It may also be clinically prudent to provide 
counseling on other measures to reduce the risk of 
unintentional household or environmental injuries from 
falls, drownings, fires or burns, poisoning, and firearms 
(see Clinical Intervention). Counseling to prevent motor 
vehicle injuries is discussed in Chapter 51.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Unintentional injuries accounted for over 95,000 deaths in 
the United States in 1986, making it the fourth leading 
cause of death.1 Injury is the leading cause of death in 
persons aged 1-44.1 There are an estimated 60 million 
nonfatal injuries each year in the United States.2 About 
half of all injury-related deaths occur in motor vehicle 
crashes.1 (This injury category is discussed separately in 
Chapter 51.) The other half of unintentional injury-related 
deaths, or about 47,000 per year,1 are household and 
environmental injuries: falls, drownings, fires, 
poisonings, suffocation, and firearm mishaps. Each year 
about 12,000 Americans, primarily older persons, die as a 
result of falls.3 Falls are the second leading cause of 
injury death in the United States and the leading cause of 
nonfatal injuries.3 There are 172,000 hip fractures each 
year in the United States,4 resulting in an estimated cost 
of over $7 billion per year.5 Hip fractures are an 
especially serious complication of falls in the elderly, 
since there is a 15-20% reduction in expected survival in 
the first year following a hip fracture.6,7 Roughly half of 
survivors never recover normal function.7 About 7700 
Americans die each year by drowning, including 1200 
boating-related drownings.3,8 In adolescents, drowning is 
the second leading cause of death.8 Fires are the third 
leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United 
States. Each year, residential fires are responsible for 
about 5000 deaths, 19,000 injuries, and $3.4 billion in 
property damage.3 Unintentional poisonings account for 3300 
deaths per year.9 Firearm injuries result in about 1800 
unintentional deaths each year (5% of all firearm 
fatalities) and five times as many nonfatal injuries.3
 
Efficacy of Risk Reduction
 
Intoxication with alcohol or other drugs is a consistent 
risk factor for injuries. In addition to its role in motor 
vehicle crashes, which has been most thoroughly studied, 
alcohol intoxication is involved in 40% of all fatal fires 
and burns and 50% of all deaths from drowning, boating 
mishaps, and shootings.3,10 The large body of evidence 
linking alcohol to injuries argues strongly for counseling 
on the safe use of alcohol as an important preventive 
measure (see Chapter 47). In addition, certain 
injury-specific risk factors have been identified for 
household and environmental injuries. These are discussed 
below. In general, injury control strategies based on these 
risk factors are derived from evidence of association 
observed in retrospective studies rather than from 
prospective studies demonstrating efficacy. There have been 
few cohort studies or clinical trials measuring the impact 
on injury rates of eliminating risk factors for household 
and environmental injuries.
  Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the 
United States.3 Over 70% of deaths due to falls occur in 
persons aged 65 and over, making falls the leading cause of 
unintentional injury death in this age group.11 Although 
falls are a regular occurrence for some older persons,12 
about a third of those who have fallen in the past three 
months are unable to recall the event.13 The death rate due 
to falls in the general population is 5.1 per 100,000 
persons. In the elderly, in whom complications such as hip 
fracture can be severe, the death rate per 100,000 
increases with age, from 10.2 for those aged 65-74 to 147.0 
for persons aged 85 and over.3 Physiological changes and 
environmental agents are the principal risk factors for 
falls in older persons. Physiological risk factors include 
postural instability, gait disturbances, diminished muscle 
strength and proprioception, poor vision, and 
medications.14-16 Environmental risk factors include 
stairs, pavement irregularities, slippery surfaces, 
inadequate lighting, unexpected objects, low chairs, and 
incorrect footwear.17 Hard surfaces such as concrete 
increase the risk of fracture when a fall occurs. These 
risk factors serve as the basis for recommended 
interventions to prevent falls: exercise to enhance muscle 
strength, monitoring of medications, balance and gait 
training, and counseling to correct environmental hazards. 
The efficacy of these measures has not been fully 
evaluated. There is evidence, however, that some 
interventions can reduce fall rates in the institutional 
setting.12,18 Community-based studies are currently under 
way.
 
In addition to falls in the elderly, falls also occur in 
younger persons, especially children under age 5. These 
injuries often involve falls from stairs or furniture;19 
collapsible gates have been advocated as a means of 
protecting children from stairways.19 Although the efficacy 
of stairway gates has not been studied, there is evidence 
that window guards can reduce child falls from apartment 
windows.20
 
Nearly half of all Americans ride bicycles.21 Bicycle 
injuries account for nearly 550,000 emergency room visits 
and about 1000 deaths each year, mostly in children and 
adolescents.22,23 Potential interventions for the clinician 
include counseling bicyclists and the parents of children 
who ride bicycles about the importance of wearing safety 
helmets and avoiding riding near motor vehicle traffic. 
Between 50% and 75% of bicycle fatalities and 
hospitalizations are the result of head trauma;22,24 
central nervous system injury is the primary cause of death 
in 90% of childhood fatalities from bicycle or pedestrian 
collisions with a motor vehicle.25 There are few controlled 
studies examining the efficacy of safety helmets in 
preventing head injuries while riding bicycles,21,22 but 
recent data from a case-control study provide evidence that 
the risk of head injury among bicyclists might be reduced 
by as much as 80%.26 It is also known that safety helmets 
can reduce head injury rates among motorcyclists by 76%.27 
States that have repealed mandatory motorcycle helmet laws 
have experienced significant increases in motorcycle 
fatalities.28 The second potential intervention, counseling 
bicyclists to avoid riding near motor vehicle traffic, is 
based on evidence that nearly 95% of bicycle fatalities 
occur as a result of a collision with a motor vehicle.22 
Community efforts to separate bicyclists from motor vehicle 
traffic, such as designated bicycle lanes and paths, have 
met with success in preventing bicycle accidents,29 but the 
effectiveness of counseling bicyclists to use these routes 
remains unstudied.
  The patients at greatest risk for drowning are small 
children (aged 1-3) and young males aged 15-24.3 Drowning 
is the second leading cause of death in adolescents.8 The 
causes of drowning, and thus preventive strategies, differ 
with the age of the patient. In small children, about 
60-80% of drownings occur in swimming pools, usually 
located in the back yard of the victim's home.30-33 In 
about two-thirds of these cases, adult caretakers are 
unaware that the toddler has wandered near the pool or 
entered the water.31 Several studies suggest that about 80% 
of such drownings can be prevented by using four-foot 
fences with latchgates to protect children from wandering 
into the swimming pool area.31,34-36 Clinicians could 
advise swimming pool owners to install fences, although the 
impact of this form of counseling on drowning rates is 
unknown. In some states, pool gates and cover alarm systems 
are required by law. Some recommend toddler swimming 
lessons as a means of improving survival after submersion. 
The effectiveness of lessons at this age has never been 
proved convincingly, however;37 their safety has been 
questioned on the basis of case reports of water 
intoxication and hyponatremia.8
 
Drownings of adolescents and adults occur under different 
circumstances.38 Most drownings occur in lakes, rivers, and 
ponds in association with such water activities as 
swimming, wading, diving, boating, rafting, and 
fishing.38,39 Intoxication by alcohol or other drugs is 
common in both drownings and boating mishaps; about half of 
all victims have a significant blood alcohol level, and 
about 10% have evidence of other drugs with central nervous 
system effects.38,40 Discouraging swimming or boating while 
intoxicated would therefore appear to be appropriate, but 
there has been little research on the impact of such a 
clinical intervention. About 82% of boating-related 
drownings are associated with nonuse or inappropriate use 
of personal flotation devices,41 but there are few data on 
the impact of promoting the use of these devices. Swimming 
lessons may offer some protection against drowning, but 
this has also never been proved convincingly.
 
Fires and burns are the third leading cause of 
unintentional injury-related death. Most injuries and 
75-90% of deaths from fires occur in residential 
fires.42,43 Smoke detectors provide the most efficacious 
means of preventing deaths in residential fires. Fire 
department statistics indicate that death in a residential 
fire is two to three times more likely in homes without 
smoke detectors than in those with such devices.44,45 
However, there is no evidence of the magnitude of reduction 
in fire injuries achieved by advising patients to install 
and test smoke detectors. It is known, for example, that 
smoke detectors often fail to operate due to incorrect 
installation or inadequate testing, and some occupants 
(very young children and the handicapped) may be unable to 
hear or respond to the alarm signal.43,46 For these 
reasons, it is important that smoke alarm counseling 
emphasize the importance of correct installation and 
periodic testing to ensure proper operation.
 
Cigarette smoking causes about 25% of residential fires, 
usually through unintentional ignition of bedding or 
upholstery, and many advocate counseling regarding careless 
smoking practices and the promotion of self-extinguishing 
cigarettes. In children, flame-retardant clothing is 
effective in reducing injury from clothing ignition.3,47,48 
Since residential fires occur more frequently in the 
winter, some attention has been given to the hazards of 
certain stoves and heaters,49 but the feasibility of 
clinical intervention in such matters is limited. 
Counseling regarding hot water heaters is appropriate, 
however, since hot tap water burns, which account for 2600 
hospitalizations each year, are preventable by setting 
household water heaters at 120;dg F.3,50,51
 
Childhood poisoning can be prevented by placing medications 
in child-resistant containers. Federal legislation 
requiring such containers for aspirin, acetaminophen, 
prescription drugs, and household chemicals has been 
associated with a subsequent decrease in childhood 
poisoning from these substances.52-54 Poisoning with 
children's aspirin has also been reduced by limiting the 
number of tablets packaged in each bottle.52,55 In 
contrast, poison-warning labels designed for children do 
not appear to be efficacious. Controlled trials have 
demonstrated that poison warning stickers (such as the Mr. 
Yuk'' series) do not deter children from playing with 
medication containers56 or reduce the rate of childhood 
poisoning.57 Intentional self-poisoning by adolescents and 
adults is discussed in Chapter 45.
 
Most unintentional injuries from firearms involve 
adolescent and young adult males, and about 65-78% of these 
injuries occur in or around the home.3 Over 90% of firearm 
incidents involving children occur at home; a study in 
children aged 0-14 found that 40% involved a firearm stored 
in the room where the shooting occurred.58 Potential 
preventive strategies to prevent firearm injuries (e.g., 
counseling firearm owners to store weapons unloaded and in 
a locked compartment, gun control legislation) would appear 
to be effective but have been inadequately studied.
 
After the home, the second most common location for 
unintentional firearm injuries is the hunting site. These 
incidents often involve members of the same hunting party 
and often result from accidental discharge of the firearm, 
unsafe handling of the firearm, and the victim being out of 
sight or mistaken for game.37,59 A recent study found that 
40% of shooters in hunting accidents were less than 20 
years of age and fewer than half were supervised by adults; 
unsafe hunting practices such as carrying the firearm 
incorrectly were significantly more common in shooters who 
were 8-19 years of age.59 The investigators suggested that 
hunting firearm injuries might be reduced by adult 
supervision of child and adolescent hunters, particularly 
those who have not had formal instruction in the safe use 
of firearms, and by wearing fluorescent orange clothing 
while hunting to increase visibility. The effectiveness of 
these measures has not been studied, however. Hunter 
education programs have had mixed results in changing 
fatality rates.37
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
The most effective measures to control injuries are passive 
interventions, those that do not rely on the potential 
victim to adopt new behaviors voluntarily. Examples of 
passive interventions include revised building codes to 
prevent falls and child-resistant containers to prevent 
poisoning. Since injury prevention advice from clinicians 
usually requires active cooperation from patients (e.g., 
changing smoking practices in bed, inspecting batteries in 
smoke detectors), the effectiveness of this form of 
counseling faces inherent limitations. It is therefore not 
surprising to find in injury control research that 
counseling is most effective in combination with other 
measures that promote compliance, such as safety 
regulations.20,60
  Clinical counseling by itself appears to be of some 
benefit when offered to parents. Studies suggest an 
association between counseling and improved knowledge and 
fewer home hazards, but it is unclear whether this results 
in lower injury rates. Education has been shown to motivate 
parents to obtain syrup of ipecac, to display poison 
control center telephone numbers, and to learn more about 
the proper use of ipecac.61,62 A randomized controlled 
trial found that parents who received an individualized 
course on child safety during well-baby visits demonstrated 
greater knowledge about home hazards and had fewer hazards 
in the home when tested one month after the last visit, but 
there was no difference in the rate of injuries reported by 
the parents or recorded in hospital records.63 Another 
study found that infants of mothers who received counseling 
on fall prevention had fewer falls over the course of a 
year than did those whose mothers were not64 A randomized 
controlled trial found that couples who received 
information on burn prevention during well-child care 
classes were more likely to have their hot water heaters 
set at 130;dg F or lower when checked by investigators 
during a home visit.65
 
Other studies have found counseling to be ineffective in 
promoting safety: A controlled trial found that a program 
providing mothers with counseling on household hazards, a 
safety booklet, and free safety devices was unsuccessful in 
changing either the knowledge of the subjects or the number 
of home hazards detected in an unannounced home visit.66 
Controlled studies of counseling parents to prevent 
childhood poisoning have not shown a significant effect on 
poison injury rates.67 There is even concern that injury 
control counseling may be harmful in some patients, such as 
adolescents.37 Several investigators have hypothesized that 
adolescents who favor risk-taking behavior may respond to 
counseling by performing dangerous activities.68-70
 
Some researchers have attempted to prevent injuries through 
free distribution of injury control devices during the 
clinic visit. When smoke detectors were made available in 
one program, 92% of the recipients installed the devices in 
their home.71 A study providing parents with poison-warning 
labels designed for children was unsuccessful, however, in 
part because parents failed to apply the labels to all 
poisons in the home.57 In another study, free distribution 
of cabinet locks and electrical outlet covers resulted in 
increased use of outlet covers, which are easy to apply, 
but no increase in the installation of cabinet locks, a 
more inconvenient task.72
 
Recommendations of Others
 
Although experts agree on the importance of counseling by 
clinicians to prevent injuries, there are few guidelines on 
the specific injury control measures clinicians should 
encourage their patients to adopt. Recommendations for 
pediatricians on specific safety topics have been issued 
periodically by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). 
In addition, as part of its Injury Prevention Program 
(TIPP), the AAP recommends that pediatricians distribute 
safety surveys to parents and integrate age-specific safety 
counseling into the well-child examination. All physicians 
caring for children are advised by the AAP to encourage 
parents to acquire smoke detectors for the child's sleeping 
area, window and stairway guards/gates, and syrup of 
ipecac, and to ensure safe hot water temperatures at the 
tap.73
 
Discussion
  Although there are few injury control measures for which 
there is conclusive evidence of efficacy, and the 
effectiveness of injury control counseling is largely 
unstudied, counseling by physicians on these matters may be 
justified because of the enormous burden of suffering 
associated with injuries. Unintentional injuries are the 
leading cause of years of potential life lost in the United 
States.74 Thus, even minor reductions in their incidence 
can have large public health implications. In addition, 
there is little cost associated with this form of 
counseling when included in the clinical encounter. The 
cost of physician time may, however, be kept to a minimum 
by focusing attention during injury control counseling on 
specific injuries for which the patient is at greatest risk 
and on those preventive strategies for which the strongest 
evidence of efficacy is available. Of these, intoxication 
by alcohol and other drugs appears to be most strongly 
associated with the risk of unintentional injury or death.
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Clinicians should urge adolescents and adults who use 
alcohol or other drugs to avoid engaging in potentially 
dangerous activities (e.g., operation of a motor vehicle, 
swimming, boating, handling of firearms, smoking in bed, 
bicycling) while intoxicated. It may also be clinically 
prudent for clinicians to recommend specific injury control 
measures for persons at increased risk for certain types of 
household or environmental injuries. Smokers who cannot 
discontinue the use of tobacco (see Chapter 48) should be 
advised against smoking near bedding or upholstery. 
Homeowners should be advised to install smoke detectors in 
appropriate locations and to test the devices periodically 
to ensure proper operation. Hot water heaters should be set 
at 120;dg F, and firearms should be kept unloaded in a 
locked compartment. Parents, grandparents, or other 
patients with children in the home should be advised to 
keep a 1 oz bottle of syrup of ipecac, to display the 
telephone number of the local poison control center, and to 
place all medications, toxic substances, matches, and 
firearms in child-resistant containers. Collapsible gates 
or other barriers should be placed at stairway entrances, a 
four-foot latchgate installed around swimming pools, and 
window guards installed in high-rise buildings to prevent 
falls in children. Bicyclists and parents of children who 
ride bicycles should be counseled about the importance of 
wearing safety helmets and avoiding riding in motor vehicle 
traffic. Boaters should be encouraged to observe safe 
boating practices and to wear personal flotation devices. 
Clinical interventions to prevent motor vehicle injuries 
are discussed in Chapter 51.
 
Elderly patients or those responsible for older persons 
should be advised to inspect the home for adequate 
lighting, to remove or repair floor structures (e.g., loose 
rugs, electrical cords, toys) that predispose to tripping, 
and to install handrails and traction strips in stairways 
and bathtubs. Clinicians caring for older persons should 
periodically test visual acuity (see Chapter 31), counsel 
patients with medical conditions affecting mobility, and 
monitor the use of drugs associated with falls. Older 
patients who lack medical contraindications should be 
counseled to engage in exercise programs to maintain and 
improve mobility and flexibility (see Chapter 49).
 
The need to prevent household or environmental injuries 
should be discussed regularly with patients, especially 
those who are at increased risk for certain types of 
injuries. The optimal frequency for such counseling has not 
been determined, however, and is left to clinical 
discretion.

<h2>53. Counseling to Prevent Human Immunodeficiency
Virus Infection and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases
</a></h2>
<h3>

Recommendation:
</a></h3>

Clinicians should take a complete sexual and drug use history
on all adolescent and adult patients. Sexually active patients
should be advised that abstaining from sex or maintaining a
mutually faithful monogamous sexual relationship with a partner
known to be uninfected are the most effective strategies to
prevent infection with human immunodeficiency virus or other
sexually transmitted diseases (see<i>Clinical
Intervention</i>). Patients should also receive counseling about
the indications and proper methods for using condoms and
spermicides in sexual intercourse and about the health risks
associated with anal intercourse. Intravenous drug users should
be encouraged to enroll in a drug treatment program and should be
warned against sharing drug equipment or using unsterilized
needles and syringes. All patients should be offered testing in
accordance with recommendations on screening for syphilis,
gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital herpes, hepatitis B, and infection
with human immunodeficiency virus (see Chapters 20, 22-26).
<p>

<h3><a name="Head47">

Burden of Suffering
</a></h3>


Each year in the United States, there are about 3-4 million
cases of chlamydial infection,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r1">1</a>] 2 million cases of
gonorrhea,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r2">2</a>] and over 35,000 cases of primary and secondary
syphilis.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r3">3</a>] Primary episodes of genital herpes occur each year
in approximately 270,000 Americans,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r4">4</a>] and nearly 20 million
persons are already infected and suffering recurrent episodes.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r5">5</a>]
These diseases are associated with considerable morbidity.
Chlamydia and gonorrhea produce urethritis, epididymitis, and
proctitis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis and painful pelvic
inflammatory disease (PID) in women.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r1">1</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r6">6</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r7">7</a>] PID is an important
risk factor for ectopic pregnancy and infertility,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r8">8</a>] and about 1
million cases are reported annually in the United States.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r7">7</a>]
Syphilis produces ulcers of the genitalia, pharynx, and rectum,
and it can progress to secondary syphilis (with skin lesions,
lymphadenopathy, and condyloma lata) and the severe complications
of tertiary syphilis (cardiovascular and neurologic disorders) if
left untreated.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r9">9</a>] Persons with genital herpes suffer painful
vesicular and ulcerative lesions and recurrent episodes due to
latent infection.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r10">10</a>]
<p>
Hepatitis B and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are
sexually transmitted diseases that are also transmitted through
the exchange of blood or blood products. An estimated 500,000 to
1 million persons in the United States have been infected with
hepatitis B virus (HBV),[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r11">11</a>] and an estimated 1-1.5 million
persons are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r12">12</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r13">13</a>] Chronic carriers of HBV are at risk for developing
chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular
carcinoma, and nearly 5000 die each year as a result of these
complications.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r11">11</a>] Within 10 years of infection with HIV, about
50% of persons develop AIDS and another 40% or more develop other
clinical illnesses associated with HIV infection.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r14">14</a>] Over 82,000
cases of AIDS had been reported by the end of 1988.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r15">15</a>] Persons
with AIDS can develop severe opportunistic infections, Kaposi's
sarcoma, and multiple-system medical complications. Many also
experience social ostracism and discrimination. Although some
antimicrobial agents may extend survival,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r16">16</a>] there is currently
no available treatment to prevent death in persons with AIDS. In
a study performed before the licensure of AZT (azidothymidine,
zidovudine), the five-year survival rate was only 15%.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r17">17</a>] AIDS
has become the seventh leading cause of years of potential life
lost in the United States,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r18">18</a>] and it is the leading cause of
death in intravenous (IV) drug abusers and hemophiliacs.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r19">19</a>] By
the end of 1992, a projected total of 365,000 cases of AIDS will
have been diagnosed in the United States, and 260,000 persons
will have died from this disease.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r13">13</a>]
<p>
Pregnant women with sexually transmitted diseases can transmit
the organisms to their children. Congenital syphilis often
results in fetal or perinatal death or serious neonatal
complications. Active gonococcal or chlamydial infection can
produce obstetrical complications and neonatal infections such as
ophthalmia neonatorum.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r6">6</a>] Transmission of genital herpes to the
newborn is fatal in 65% of untreated cases, and less than 10% of
survivors with central nervous system infection have normal
development.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r10">10</a>] Infants who become infected with HBV usually
develop chronic carrier status,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r20">20</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r21">21</a>] and more than 25% of these
children will die eventually from primary hepatocellular
carcinoma or cirrhosis of the liver.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r22">22-24</a>] Pregnant women with
HIV infection may be at increased risk of developing AIDS,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r25">25</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r26">26</a>]
and about 30-35% of them transmit the virus to their
children.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r27">27</a>] Three-quarters of AIDS cases in children under age
13 result from perinatal transmission.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r28">28</a>]
<p>
The economic consequences of sexually transmitted diseases are
enormous. The estimated costs per year in the United States
include $500 million for genital herpes,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r29">29</a>] $1 billion for
chlamydial infection,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r7">7</a>] and $2.2 billion for AIDS.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r30">30</a>] Costs for
AIDS are expected to climb to as high as $13 billion per year by
1992.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r13">13</a>]
<p>
Sexually transmitted diseases are most common in young
persons, those with multiple sexual contacts, prostitutes,
homosexual and bisexual men, and persons with infected sexual
partners.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r6">6</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r7">7</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r31">31</a>] Additional risk factors for infection with HBV
or HIV include intravenous drug use, a history of blood
transfusion between 1978 and 1985, hemophilia, and being born to
an infected mother.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r28">28</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r32">32</a>] The incidence of syphilis has been
increasing steadily in recent years,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r3">3</a>] and there is evidence
that this and other genital ulcer diseases (e.g., genital herpes)
may be associated with infection with HIV.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r33">33</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r34">34</a>]
<p> 
<h3><a name="Head48">

Efficacy of Risk Reduction
</a></h3>


The most efficacious means of reducing the risk of acquiring
AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases through sexual
contact is either abstinence from sexual relations or maintenance
of a mutually monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected
partner. If the infection status of the partner is uncertain,
sexual relations should be avoided, particularly with persons at
increased risk for HIV infection (e.g., homosexual and bisexual
men, IV drug users). The prevalence of HIV infection in
heterosexual partners of persons in high-risk categories may be
as high as 11%, and as many as 60% of heterosexual partners of
HIV-infected individuals may be seropositive.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r12">12</a>] Risk is
directly related to the number of sexual partners,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r25">25</a>] in part
because of the difficulty of obtaining adequate information on
risk status from each partner.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r35">35</a>]
<p>
Certain sexual practices may also influence the risk of
infection.  Among homosexual men, for example, receptive anal
intercourse has been repeatedly implicated as a principal risk
factor for HIV infection,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r36">36</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r37">37</a>] and other practices that
increase rectal trauma may have a similar role.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r25">25</a>] Conversely,
some sexual practices, such as using latex condoms and
spermicides, may reduce the risk of infection. Condoms have been
shown in the laboratory to prevent transmission of <i>Chlamydia
trachomatis</i>, herpes simplex virus,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r38">38</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r39">39</a>] trichomonas,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r40">40</a>]
cytomegalovirus, and HIV.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r41">41</a>] Although further data are needed on
the efficacy of latex condoms in actual practice, there is
epidemiologic evidence that persons who use condoms correctly are
at decreased risk of acquiring gonococcal and nongonococcal
urethritis[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r40">40</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r42">42</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r43">43</a>] and HIV infection.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r44">44</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r45">45</a>] Even under optimal
conditions, however, condoms are not always efficacious in
preventing transmission. Condom failures occur at an estimated
rate of 10-15%,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r46">46-48</a>] either as a result of product failure
(e.g., breakage) or as a result of incorrect or inconsistent use.
Natural membrane condoms may be more permeable than latex condoms
to passage of HIV[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r49">49</a>] and other sexually transmitted organisms
such as herpes virus, and they are less uniform than latex
condoms.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r50">50</a>] Errors on the part of users, however, are thought to
be the most likely cause of condom failure.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r51">51</a>] Incorrect use has
been shown to limit the effectiveness of condoms in preventing
gonorrhea[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r43">43</a>] and presumably also permits passage of more
dangerous organisms such as HIV.
<p>
The use of spermicides, along with condoms, has been proposed
as a means of further reducing the risk of infection. One of the
spermicidal agents that has been investigated, nonoxynol 9, has
been shown to have <i>in vitro</i> activity against herpes simplex
virus,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r52">52</a>] hepatitis B,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r53">53</a>] and HIV.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r54">54</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r55">55</a>] It also has clinical
efficacy in reducing the risk of gonorrhea[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r56">56-60</a>] and chlamydial
infection in women.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r60">60</a>] In many clinical studies, however,
spermicides were used in combination with condoms or diaphragms,
and therefore it is unclear which intervention or combination of
interventions was directly responsible for the outcome.  There is
also inadequate information on the effectiveness of spermicides
inserted in condoms if the condoms rupture; subinhibitory
concentrations of spermicide would presumably be more likely if
condom rupture occurs in the rectum (or in the vagina in the
absence of supplemental vaginal application of
spermicide).[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r55">55</a>]
<p>
Additional measures to reduce the risk of infection with HIV
and hepatitis B include avoiding the use of intravenous drugs or
unsterilized needles and syringes. The characteristics of drug
addiction often make prompt discontinuation of IV drug abuse
difficult. Drug treatment programs, such as methadone maintenance
clinics, can be effective in some patients, but many drug addicts
lack access to such facilities or return to their habit following
treatment (see Chapter 47). Even in persons who continue to use
IV drugs, morbidity and mortality from HIV, hepatitis B, and
bacterial endocarditis could be reduced by using sterilized
needles and syringes. AIDS is the leading cause of death in this
population,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r19">19</a>] and even a modest reduction in risk could have
significant public health implications. Methods for obtaining
uncontaminated drug equipment include purchasing sterilized
equipment, obtaining free products through distribution programs,
and cleaning used equipment with a bleach solution.

Effectiveness of Counseling
</a></h3>


There have been few studies examining the effectiveness of
physicians in influencing the sexual behavior of patients.
Studies of clinic-based educational programs, which in some cases
have included physician counseling as a component, have reported
increased rate of return for test-of-cure[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r61">61</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r62">62</a>] and reduced
incidence of certain sexually transmitted diseases,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r63">63</a>] but these
studies involved select populations and provided little evidence
of change in sexual behavior. Other successful measures have
included distribution of free condoms to inner-city male
adolescents[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r64">64</a>] and of bleach products to clean drug injection
equipment,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r65">65</a>] but these items were not distributed by
physicians. Sexual behavior appears to have changed significantly
in recent years as a result of increased public awareness of
AIDS. Homosexual and bisexual men report fewer high-risk sexual
practices.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r66">66-71</a>] Behavior may also be changing in heterosexual
populations living in high-risk areas[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r72">72</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r73">73</a>] and in some
intravenous drug users.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r74">74-78</a>] Surveys in New York City have
found that the proportion of patients taking methadone who
reported some form of behavioral change to reduce the risk of
acquiring HIV infection increased from 59% in 1984 to 75% in 1986
and to 85% in 1987.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r76">76</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r77">77</a>]
<p>
There is also evidence from recent surveys that behavior is
not changing dramatically in certain population groups, such as
adolescents[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r79">79</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r80">80</a>] and college students,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r81">81</a>] despite increased
knowledge of the health risks associated with high-risk sexual
practices. A number of factors may account for this reluctance to
change behavior. Compliance with the proper use of condoms and
spermicides can be affected by perceptions of inconvenience,
concerns about sexual spontaneity, and cultural
attitudes.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r48">48</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r62">62</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r82">82</a>] Prostitutes and drug addicts, who have
special dependency on high-risk behaviors, face added
difficulties in changing behavior.  Only 4% of female prostitutes
report condom use with each vaginal exposure,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r83">83</a>] and an unknown
number of IV drug users continue to use contaminated injection
equipment. Sterilized needles and syringes are frequently
unavailable or prohibitively expensive, and access to health care
for substance abuse counseling and medical treatment is often
poor.
<p>
Clinicians may provide ineffective counseling or no counseling
if they have inadequate historical data on the patient's sexual
and drug use behavior. A complete sexual history is therefore
especially important as a prelude to any form of effective
counseling to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Many
clinicians do not, however, take an adequate sexual history. A
recent survey of primary care physicians found that only 10%
asked new patients questions specific enough to identify those at
risk of exposure to HIV.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r84">84</a>]
<p> 
<h3><a name="Head50">

Recommendations of Others
</a></h3>


Recommendations for physicians to counsel patients on measures
to prevent sexually transmitted diseases have been issued by a
number of authorities, including the U.S. Surgeon General,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r85">85</a>]
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r50">50</a>] the American Medical
Association,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r86">86</a>] the American College of Physicians,[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r87">87</a>] and the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r88">88</a>] The key
elements of such counseling have been outlined by the U.S. Public
Health Service and include the following: abstain from sex or
maintain a mutually faithful monogamous sexual relationship with
an uninfected partner; abstain from sex with individuals who are
not known with certainty to be seronegative and who have not been
the sole partner for six months prior to or any time after the
test; do not practice anal intercourse; do not use unsterilized
syringes, needles, or drugs; and always use a condom if there are
any doubts about the status of the sexual partner. Detailed
instructions for patients on the proper use of condoms have been
published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r51">51</a>] and the
FDA.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r50">50</a>] The CDC recommends that condoms be made more widely
available by health care providers in clinics for sexually
transmitted diseases, family planning, and drug
treatment.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r51">51</a>]
<p>
The CDC, in collaboration with a number of other groups, has
also recommended that seronegative pregnant women and women of
childbearing age who are at increased risk of becoming infected
with HIV receive additional counseling regarding the maternal and
fetal risks associated with pregnancy should they become
infected, and that they should be advised to consider delaying
pregnancy.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r26">26</a>]
<p> 
<h3><a name="Head51">

Discussion
</a></h3>


Although it has not been proved that physicians can change the
sexual behavior of patients, there is evidence that the frequency
of high-risk behaviors can be reduced in response to information
provided through public education.  While clinicians are
principally involved in the treatment of infected persons with
clinical illness, they can also play an important role in
asymptomatic persons by reinforcing and clarifying educational
messages, providing literature and community resource references
for additional information, and dispelling misconceptions about
unproven modes of transmission. In addition, physicians treating
the medical problems of certain high-risk groups (e.g., IV drug
users, prostitutes) have special access to persons who may
receive little information through public media about preventive
measures and thus may continue to practice high-risk behavior. IV
drug users account for the largest proportion of new cases of
hepatitis B and, in some areas, AIDS.[<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r28">28</a>,<a href="http://text.nlm.nih.gov/cps/www/cpsr53.html#r32">32</a>] Physicians are also
an important source of information about and encouragement to use
drug treatment centers; clinics for sexually transmitted diseases
and family planning; and community programs offering free
condoms, sterilized drug equipment, and cleaning solutions for
needles.
<p> 
<h3><a name="Head52">

Clinical Intervention
</a></h3>


Clinicians should take a complete sexual and drug use history
on all adolescent and adult patients. Sexually active patients
should receive complete information on their risk for acquiring
sexually transmitted diseases. They should be advised that
abstaining from sex or maintaining a mutually faithful monogamous
sexual relationship with a partner known to be uninfected are the
most effective strategies to prevent infection with HIV or other
sexually transmitted diseases. Patients should be advised against
sexual activity with individuals whose infection status is
uncertain. A nonreactive HIV test does not rule out infection if
the sexual partner has not been monogamous for at least six
months before the test. Patients who choose to engage in sexual
activity with multiple partners or with persons who may be
infected should be advised to use a condom at each encounter and
to avoid anal intercourse. Women should be informed of the
potential risks of HIV infection during pregnancy. Persons who
use intravenous drugs should be encouraged to enroll in a drug
treatment program, warned against sharing drug equipment and
using unsterilized syringes and needles, and given sources for
uncontaminated injection equipment or referred to community
programs with this information. Patients should be offered
testing in accordance with recommendations on screening for
syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital herpes, hepatitis B, and
infection with HIV (see Chapters 20-26).
<p>
Condoms need not be recommended to prevent infection in 
long-standing mutually monogamous relationships in which neither
partner uses IV drugs or is infected with HIV. Those patients who
need to use condoms should be informed that they do not provide
complete protection against infection and must be used in
accordance with the following guidelines to be effective:
<ul>
<li> Latex condoms, rather than natural membrane condoms, should
be used.  Torn condoms, those in damaged packages, or those with
signs of age (brittle, sticky, discolored) should not be
used.</li>
<li> The condom should be put on an erect penis, before any
intimate contact, and should be unrolled completely to the base.
</li>
<li> A space should be left at the tip of the condom to collect
semen; air pockets in the space should be removed by pressing the
air out towards the base.  </li>
<li> Water-based libricants should be used.  Those made with
petroleum jelly, mineral oil, cold cream, and other oil-based
lubricants should not be applied because they may damage the
condom.</li>
<li> Insertion of nonoxynol 9 in the condom increases
protection, but vaginal application in addition to condom use is
likely to provide greater protection.</li>
<li> If a condom breaks, it should be replaced immediately.</li>
<li> After ejaculation and while the penis is still erect, the
penis should be withdrawn while carefully holding the condom
against the base of the penis so that the condom remains in
place.</li>
<li> Condoms should not be reused.  </li> </ol>

<PRE>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Recommendation:
 
Postexposure prophylaxis should be provided to selected 
persons with exposures to Haemophilus influenzae type b 
disease, meningococcal infection, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, 
tuberculosis, and rabies (see Clinical Intervention). 

Burden of Suffering
 
Secondary infection following exposure to persons with 
certain infectious diseases may be preventable through the 
prompt administration of prophylactic antibiotics or 
immunobiologics. Although a complete discussion of each of 
these diseases is beyond the scope of this report, certain 
exposures deserve special emphasis. These include 
Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, infection with 
Neisseria meningitidis, hepatitis A and B, tuberculosis, 
and rabies.
 
Systemic Haemophilus influenzae type b occurs in about 1 
out of every 200 children born in the United States.1 Most 
cases occur during infancy,2,3 but children remain 
susceptible to infection until age 5. Children are at 
especially increased risk if they are exposed to infected 
persons at home or at day-care centers.2-4 Meningococcal 
infections were reported in nearly 3000 persons in 1987.5 
Infection with Neisseria meningitidis can lead to severe 
meningitis and septicemia.6 Hepatitis A and hepatitis B 
each accounted for over 25,000 new cases in 1987, and over 
22,000 new cases of tuberculosis were reported in the same 
year.5 Human rabies remains an uncommon disease in the 
United States, with only nine cases diagnosed since 1980.7 
In the absence of adequate postexposure prophylaxis, 
however, infected persons often die from rabies 
encephalitis.8
 
Efficacy of Prophylaxis
 
Rifampin prophylaxis can reduce the risk of secondary 
infection in persons exposed to Haemophilus influenzae type 
b (Hib) and Neisseria meningitidis. Studies have shown that 
a four-day antibiotic regimen can reduce both the rate of 
asymptomatic carriage of Hib and the incidence of secondary 
infection in household and day-care contacts of infected 
persons.3,9-11 Rifampin may also be effective in reducing 
secondary infection in children exposed at day-care centers 
to Hib-infected children.4,12 Similarly, rifampin 
prophylaxis in contacts of patients with meningococcal 
infection can reduce the rate of colonization and secondary 
infection.13 Sulfonamides are preferred over rifampin if 
the strain of Neisseria meningitidis is known to be 
sensitive.14
 
Since the 1940s, passive immunization with immune globulin 
has been shown to be an effective means of preventing 
infection with hepatitis A in persons exposed to active 
disease.15 Standard immunoglobulin (IG) must be 
administered within two weeks of exposure. Hepatitis B 
immune globulin (HBIG) is about 75% effective when 
administered promptly to susceptible persons with 
percutaneous, sexual, or mucosal exposure to hepatitis 
B.16-18 Combined HBIG plus hepatitis B vaccine is over 90% 
effective in preventing perinatal transmission (see Chapter 
20) and is likely to be equally effective in other 
circumstances. For passive prophylaxis, a second HBIG dose 
is generally necessary after one month. This second dose 
can be obviated through active immunization with hepatitis 
B vaccine at the time of the first dose of HBIG. 
Active-passive immunization has the advantage of providing 
long-term protection against future exposure.19 Recombinant 
DNA hepatitis B vaccine has recently become available in 
the United States and appears to be more immunogenic (see 
Chapter 57).
 
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a live vaccine derived from 
attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, has been used worldwide for 
more than 50 years to prevent tuberculosis (TB). Clinical 
trials of the efficacy of BCG have yielded inconsistent 
results since the early 1930s, however, with reported 
levels of protection ranging from -56% to 80%.20 In a 
recent report, a large controlled trial in India reported 
no significant reduction in the risk of sputum-positive 
pulmonary TB in 15 years of follow-up.21 Observational 
studies have shown that the incidence of the disease is 
lower in vaccinated children than in unvaccinated 
controls.22-27 Factors contributing to the wide variation 
in results in BCG vaccine efficacy include genetic changes 
in the bacterial strains as well as differences in 
production techniques, methods of administration, and the 
populations and environments in which the vaccine has been 
studied.28 In the United States, where the risk of becoming 
infected with TB is relatively low, the disease can be 
controlled most successfully by periodic tuberculin skin 
testing of high-risk groups and the administration of 
preventive chemotherapy to those whose skin tests convert 
from negative to positive (see Chapter 21). However, BCG 
vaccination may have a role in the United States for 
persons with special exposures to individuals with active 
TB, such as uninfected children who are at high risk for 
continuous or repeated exposure to infectious persons who 
remain undetected or untreated.28
 
Combined active-passive immunization provides effective 
postexposure prophylaxis against exposure to rabies. Two 
vaccine preparations, human diploid cell vaccine and rabies 
vaccine adsorbed, are licensed in the United States, but 
only the former is widely available.29 All persons treated 
with at least five doses of human diploid cell vaccine (or 
rabies vaccine, adsorbed) and human rabies immune globulin 
have developed adequate antibody titers.29 Since human 
rabies is a rare disease, with less than five cases per 
year having occurred in the United States since 1960,30 it 
is difficult to measure the efficacy of postexposure 
prophylaxis by the incidence of actual cases. No cases of 
rabies were reported in over 500 persons given postexposure 
therapy (human diploid cell vaccine and rabies immune 
globulin) for bite exposures to rabid animals.31,32 Very 
rarely, cases of fatal encephalitis have been reported in 
individuals given human diploid cell vaccine; in one case 
immune globulin was not administered, and in the other, 
rabies vaccine was not administered as directed.14,33 
Rabies vaccination is also recommended for preexposure 
prophylaxis in persons at high risk of contact with rabies 
virus, such as animal handlers, veterinarians, cave 
explorers, and hunters exposed to rabid animals.31,34 A 
three-dose series of human diploid cell vaccine (1 mL IM or 
0.1 mL ID) on days 0, 7, and 28 provides adequate antibody 
response in virtually all recipients.35,36
 
Recommendations of Others
 
The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and/or the American 
College of Physicians have issued recommendations on 
postexposure prophylaxis for Haemophilus influenzae type b 
disease,37 meningococcal infection,38 hepatitis A and 
B,39,40 rabies,36,41 and tuberculosis.28 The American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued 
detailed guidelines on the use of vaccines during 
pregnancy.42
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Oral rifampin prophylaxis should be prescribed promptly for 
all household contacts of patients with Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, if at least one of the contacts is a 
child less than 4 years old. Prophylaxis of infants and 
young children (less than 2 years old) with day-care 
exposure to infected cases may also be appropriate. The 
dosage is 20 mg/kg, with a maximum of 600 mg, daily for 
four days for children and adults. Infants less than 1 
month old should receive 10 mg/kg.
 
Oral rifampin prophylaxis is also indicated for household 
or day-care contacts of persons with meningococcal 
infection, as well as for those with direct exposure to 
oral secretions (e.g., kissing). Dosage is 600 mg for 
adults, 10 mg/kg for children 1 month of age or older, and 
5 mg/kg for children under 1 month of age, all given twice 
daily for two days. Rifampin is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. Sulfonamides should be used if the meningococcus 
is adequately sensitive.
 
Hepatitis A immune globulin (0.02 mL/kg intramuscularly) 
should be administered to close household and sexual 
contacts of persons with hepatitis A, staff and children at 
day-care centers where hepatitis A is occurring, staff and 
patients of custodial institutions in which hepatitis A is 
occurring, and co-workers of food handlers with hepatitis 
A. Immune globulin should be given within two weeks of 
exposure.
 
The recommended protocol for postexposure prophylaxis 
against hepatitis B depends on the nature of the exposure 
and the HB vaccination status of the exposed person. For 
unvaccinated persons with percutaneous or mucous membrane 
exposure to blood known to be hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) positive, or those bitten by a known carrier, a 
single intramuscular dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) should be 
administered immediately, and a three-dose series of 
hepatitis B vaccine should be initiated. The first dose 
should accompany the dose of HBIG; the second and third 
doses should be given one and six months later. If vaccine 
is not administered, a second dose of HBIG should be given 
after one month. The three-dose vaccine series should also 
be initiated for persons with percutaneous or mucosal 
exposure to bodily fluids of persons at high risk of being 
infected. However, serologic confirmation of the HBsAg 
status of the suspected person should be obtained within 
seven days of exposure before administering HBIG. For 
percutaneous exposure to bodily fluids of persons at low 
risk, a three-dose vaccine series should be administered; 
testing of the source person and HBIG administration are 
not necessary.
 
Previously vaccinated persons exposed to infected bodily 
fluids should receive serologic testing. If the exposed 
person has inadequate antibody, one dose of HBIG should be 
given along with a vaccine booster dose (1 mL or 20 mcg) at 
a different site. If the source is at high risk of HB 
infection but HBsAg status is unknown, serologic testing of 
the source is indicated only if the exposed person is a 
known vaccine nonresponder. If the source is 
HBsAg-positive, the exposed person should receive one dose 
of HBIG and a vaccine booster dose.
  Persons with sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive persons 
should receive serologic screening before treatment, unless 
it will delay intervention to more than 14 days after 
exposure. Seronegative persons should receive a single dose 
of HBIG within 14 days of the last sexual contact. A second 
dose should be given if the source remains HBsAg-positive 
at three months and exposure continues. If the source 
becomes a carrier (HBsAg-positive for six months), the 
contact should receive a complete vaccine series. For 
exposures among homosexual men, the HB vaccine series 
should be initiated at the time HBIG is given; for 
exposures among heterosexuals, the HB vaccine is optional. 
If HB vaccine is given, additional doses of HBIG are 
unnecessary.
 
See Chapter 20 for recommendations on prenatal screening 
and neonatal vaccination against hepatitis B, as well as 
for general information about HB vaccine. More details on 
postexposure prophylaxis for HB are available from CDC 
publications.39-40
 
Postexposure prophylaxis against rabies should be 
instituted if a possible exposure to rabies virus has 
occurred. Criteria for making this assessment, which 
include the type of animal (e.g., carnivorous wild animals, 
bats), the circumstances of the incident (e.g., unprovoked 
attack), and the type of exposure (e.g., bite), are 
available in published guidelines14 and from local health 
departments. Rabies immune globulin is given at a dose of 
20 IU/kg; half of the dose is infiltrated around the wound, 
and the remainder is given intramuscularly at another site. 
Rabies vaccine is administered in the deltoid area in five 
1 mL intramuscular injections: days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. 
Persons who were immunized before the incident require only 
two 1 mL doses of vaccine (day of exposure and day 3) and 
do not require immune globulin. Rabies vaccination is also 
recommended for preexposure prophylaxis in persons at high 
risk of contact with rabies virus, such as veterinarians, 
animal handlers, cave explorers, and hunters exposed to 
rabid animals.
 
BCG vaccination against TB should be considered only in 
tuberculin-negative children who cannot be placed on 
isoniazid (INH) and who have continuous exposure to persons 
with active disease, those with continuous exposure to 
patients with organisms resistant to INH or rifampin, and 
those belonging to groups with a rate of new infections 
greater than 1% per year and for whom the usual 
surveillance and treatment programs may not be 
operationally feasible. These groups may also include 
persons with limited access to or willingness to use health 
care services.

Recommendation:
 
 Clinicians should obtain a complete sexual history from 
all adolescent and adult patients. Sexually active women 
who do not want to become pregnant and men who do not want 
to have a child should receive detailed counseling on 
methods to prevent unintended pregnancy (see Clinical 
Intervention). Sexually active patients should also receive 
information on measures to prevent sexually transmitted 
diseases (see Chapter 53).
 
Burden of Suffering
 
The exact prevalence of unwanted pregnancies in the United 
States is uncertain due to difficulties in data collection, 
but it is thought to represent a significant proportion of 
pregnancies, especially among adolescent and young adult 
parents. Unwanted pregnancies represent a subset of 
unintended pregnancies. It has been estimated that about 
37% of births among women aged 15-44 are unintended (i.e., 
came sooner than wanted or were not wanted ever) and just 
over one-quarter of these (10% of births) are thought to be 
unwanted.1 Over 18% of births to women aged 35-44 are 
thought to be unwanted.1 Each year there are about 1.5 
million induced abortions performed in the United States, 
primarily as an elective procedure to terminate unwanted 
pregnancies.2 The rate of unintended pregnancies occurring 
among adolescents is higher in the United States than in 
most other developed nations.1 Each year in the United 
States, about 1 million adolescent females aged 15-19 
(about 8-10% of this age group) and nearly 30,000 girls 
under age 15 become pregnant.2,3 About 40% of pregnant 
females aged 15-19 choose to undergo induced abortion.2 
Female teenagers account for 27% of all induced abortions 
in the United States; the abortion rate in women aged 18-19 
is higher than at any other age.2 Nearly 490,000 females 
aged 15-19 give birth each year, and a third of these 
mothers are age 17 or younger.2,3 Nearly one-third of 
pregnant girls under age 15 carry their fetuses to term, 
resulting in 10,000 live births per year in this age 
group.2
 
Unintended pregnancies can have adverse effects on both 
children and their parents. Unwanted pregnancy is a risk 
factor for child abuse and neglect, and many children born 
of unwanted pregnancies have behavioral and/or educational 
problems at later ages.4,5 When pregnancy occurs during 
adolescence, there may be increased risk of maternal and 
neonatal complications (such as low birthweight).6 This is 
in part because adolescents often fail to obtain adequate 
antenatal care and often fail to modify behavioral risk 
factors (e.g., smoking, poor nutrition) during pregnancy. 
Adolescents and young adults who bear children often must 
postpone or abandon educational and employment 
opportunities to care for their children. About half of 
adolescents who bear children are unmarried at the time of 
birth.7,8 Those who are married often face intense marital 
pressures that can lead to divorce or separation while the 
child is still young. It has been estimated that first 
births to adolescents in 1979 cost the United States at 
least $8.3 billion,9 and current estimates are in the range 
of $11-13 billion per year.
 
Initiation of sexual activity at a young age, a primary 
risk factor for unintended pregnancy, is common in the 
United States. Over half of unmarried American adolescents 
in the United States report having had sexual intercourse 
by age 18.10 Teenagers account for one-third of patients 
attending family planning clinics in the United States.11 
The proportion of unmarried female teenagers who are 
sexually active increases with age: 18% at age 15, 29% at 
age 16, 40% at age 17, 54% at age 18, and 66% by age 19.10 
In a survey of urban black high school males, 87% of the 
respondents reported having had sexual intercourse.12 
Sexual activity is reported in about 75% of never married 
women aged 20-24.13 Sexual activity at younger ages is more 
common among blacks and families of low socioeconomic 
status and among adolescents who smoke, use alcohol or 
other drugs, and have evidence of delinquency.13-16
 
Efficacy of Risk Reduction
 
Without contraception, 89% of heterosexual couples who 
engage in regular sexual intercourse will conceive within 
one year.17,18 There are several approaches to preventing 
unintended pregnancy. Complete sexual abstinence is the 
most effective form of contraception, and it is seen by 
many as the most appropriate behavior for unmarried 
adolescents. In persons who are sexually active, available 
methods to prevent conception include those that work 
either temporarily (contraceptive hormones, barrier 
methods, spermicides, coitus interruptus, periodic 
abstinence, intrauterine devices) or permanently 
(sterilization). Selection of an appropriate method of 
birth control must take into consideration the personal 
preferences, religious beliefs, and abilities of the 
patient, the nature of the relationship with the 
partner(s), and the attitudes and legal restrictions of 
society. It is clear from a medical and scientific 
perspective, however, that certain methods are more 
effective than others in preventing unintended pregnancy.
 
Contraceptive hormones include oral contraceptives 
(combined preparations and progestin-only pills), 
postcoital preparations, and injectable contraceptives. 
Combination oral contraceptives are the most effective and 
popular method of reversible contraception; they are used 
by an estimated 10 million American women.19 The pill'' is 
generally taken daily for 21 days, followed by either 
placebo or no pills for 7 days. The failure rate 
(proportion of women who conceive during first year of use) 
is about 3% under typical usage conditions and as low as 
0.1% when used correctly and consistently.17,18 Women who 
take oral contraceptives also may experience 
noncontraceptive benefits, such as a reduction in certain 
menstrual disorders (e.g., primary dysmenorrhea, 
menorrhagia), and reduced risk of benign breast disease, 
functional ovarian cysts, leiomyomata, and some gynecologic 
cancers.20
 
Some women taking oral contraceptives experience unpleasant 
side effects, such as breakthrough bleeding and breast 
tenderness, but these have been minimized in recent years 
by lowering the dose of estrogen to less than 50 mcg and by 
adopting multiphasic regimens that alter the dose during 
the menstrual cycle.21 Some epidemiologic studies have 
shown an association between the use of oral contraceptives 
and certain diseases, including myocardial infarction, 
hypertension, strokes, thromboembolic disorders, 
hepatocellular and perhaps breast cancer, and gallbladder 
disease.22-29 Definitive evidence regarding the strength of 
these associations, independent of other risk factors for 
these diseases, is lacking due to the logistical problems 
of performing appropriate long-term prospective studies.30 
Moreover, the probability of such complications from oral 
contraceptives is relatively small (especially in the 
absence of known contraindications). The probability of a 
fatal complication is 1 in 63,000 for nonsmoking women who 
take oral contraceptives for one year, whereas the risk is 
1 in 10,000 for women who carry a fetus to term.17 Women 
informed of the low level of risk and potential 
noncontraceptive benefits associated with oral 
contraceptives may find this a more acceptable and safer 
method than using alternative techniques or risking the 
consequences of unintended pregnancy.
 
Other contraceptive hormone preparations include the 
progestin-only pill, postcoital administration, and 
injectable progestins. The progestin-only pill, which has a 
failure rate of 0.5-3.0%,17 is somewhat less effective than 
combination oral contraceptives and is used infrequently in 
the United States. Postcoital administration of oral 
contraceptives can be of some value after unprotected 
intercourse.17,18 These agents, which usually consist of 
ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, are taken within 72 
hours of intercourse. Prominent side effects include 
irregular bleeding and nausea and vomiting; the latter 
occurs in about half of recipients.31 Injectable progestins 
(medroxyprogesterone) are administered two to four times a 
year and have a failure rate of only 0.3%.17,18 They 
require intramuscular injections, however, and have not yet 
been licensed for routine use in the United States. Neither 
oral nor injectable contraceptives offer protection against 
sexually transmitted diseases.
 
Barrier contraceptive methods include the condom, 
diaphragm, cervical cap, and vaginal sponge. Barrier 
methods have the advantage of fewer side effects than oral 
contraceptives, but they are highly dependent on patient 
compliance to ensure proper use. When used correctly, 
condoms have a 2% failure rate in preventing pregnancy, but 
the rate may be as high as 12% under conditions of typical 
usage.17,18 Diaphragms, in combination with spermicides, 
have a failure rate of about 3% when used correctly but the 
rate may be as high as 18% when used incorrectly or 
inconsistently.17,18 The corresponding failure rates for 
the cervical cap are 5% and 18%, respectively.17,18 
Failures of condoms and diaphragms are occasionally the 
result of product deficiencies (e.g., condom rupture), but 
more often they are due to user error. Spermicides (e.g., 
foams, creams, jellies) improve the effectiveness of 
barrier methods by providing protection in the event of 
product or user failure.
 
The vaginal sponge, which is impregnated with spermicide, 
is less effective than other barrier methods, with failure 
rates as high as 18-28% under typical usage 
conditions.17,18 When used correctly, the failure rate is 
about 5-8%. It provides protection for up to 24 hours 
following insertion and should remain in place for at least 
six hours after the last act of intercourse. Cases of toxic 
shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using the 
vaginal sponge, but the risk of this complication appears 
to be very low.32 It has been estimated that only 10 cases 
of TSS can be expected for every 100,000 women who use the 
vaginal sponge;33 the risk of death in persons with TSS is 
about 3%.17 Spermicides can be used alone as a 
contraceptive, but must be inserted deep into the vagina 
before each act of coitus to be effective. Failure rates 
range from 3%, when used correctly, to as high as 21% under 
typical usage conditions.17,18
 
Barrier methods and spermicides are the only birth control 
techniques (other than sexual abstinence) that are also 
effective in reducing the risk of acquiring sexually 
transmitted diseases. In particular, latex condoms combined 
with spermicides containing nonoxynol 9 have been shown to 
reduce the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) and a number of other important sexually transmitted 
organisms (see Chapter 53). It is therefore important for 
clinicians to consider both the risks of infection as well 
as those of pregnancy when recommending specific 
contraceptive techniques.
 
Modified coital behaviors, such as coitus interruptus 
(withdrawal) or fertility awareness methods (e.g., periodic 
abstinence or natural family planning), offer less 
protection against pregnancy than do the most commonly used 
contraceptive techniques. However, they may be more 
acceptable alternatives for persons with religious 
restrictions,34 those concerned about the long-term use of 
oral contraceptives, and those who find insertion of 
contraceptive devices unacceptable. It is often difficult 
to perform these methods correctly. Fertility awareness 
methods require monitoring the calendar dates of the last 
menstrual period, body temperature, or cervical mucus 
characteristics. Coitus interruptus can fail if withdrawal 
is not timed properly or if preejaculatory fluid is 
released before withdrawal. Due to these difficulties with 
compliance, withdrawal and periodic abstinence both carry 
failure rates as high as 18-20%.17,18 Effectiveness may be 
improved by combining these with other contraceptive 
methods, such as barrier methods during the fertile days of 
the menstrual cycle.
 
Intrauterine devices (IUD) are effective contraceptives 
(1-6% failure rate) and have the added convenience of 
needing infrequent replacement.17,18 However, most IUD 
devices were withdrawn from the U.S. market in the early 
1980s due to medicolegal concerns about a possible 
association with pelvic inflammatory disease and subsequent 
tubal infertility. Aside from an expensive 
progesterone-releasing IUD35 and a new copper IUD that has 
only recently been introduced,36 this form of contraception 
is largely unavailable in the United States. This has led 
many women uncomfortable with oral contraceptives and 
barrier methods to turn to less effective contraceptive 
alternatives.35 In contrast to barrier methods, the IUD 
does not offer protection against sexually transmitted 
diseases.
 
Sterilization is the most common method of contraception in 
the United States.37 The failure rate is 0.1-0.2% for male 
sterilization (vasectomy) and 0.2-0.4% for female 
sterilization (tubal ligation).17,18 Both methods are 
associated with occasional surgical complications. About 
0.3-1.6% of vasectomies are complicated by acute side 
effects (e.g., hematoma, infection, epididymitis).17The 
risk of surgical or anesthesia-related complications from 
tubal ligation depends on the center and the type of 
procedure (e.g., mini-laparotomy, laparoscopy, colpotomy), 
but the complication rate is often less than 1%.17 
Suggested long-term effects of sterilization, such as 
endocrinologic changes, effects on atherosclerosis in men, 
and abnormal menstrual patterns in women have not been 
demonstrated convincingly in clinical studies.17 
Sterilization does not offer protection against sexually 
transmitted diseases, but it may reduce the risk of pelvic 
inflammatory disease.38
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
Many patients of childbearing age seen by clinicians are at 
risk for unintended pregnancy and do not practice effective 
contraceptive techniques. About 30% of unmarried teens aged 
15-19 practice unprotected sexual intercourse.37 A survey 
of sexually active black high school males found that only 
60% had used a contraceptive at their last sexual 
encounter, and most lacked accurate knowledge about the 
relative effectiveness and availability of various birth 
control methods.12 Inconsistent or incorrect use of 
contraceptives is reported in at least half of pregnant 
women receiving counseling for abortion.39
 
Thus, many of the patients seen by primary care clinicians 
are in need of better information about contraceptive 
methods and the prescription of appropriate products. The 
need for clinicians to provide this type of counseling is 
not restricted to family planning clinics; family planning 
counseling is often indicated in the primary care setting. 
Many women in the United States do not have access to 
family planning clinics or they seek their care 
elsewhere.40 About 70% of women who sought medical family 
planning between 1979 and 1982 visited an 
obstetrician-gynecologist or a family practitioner.41 Of 
the estimated 5 million adolescents in the United States at 
risk for unintended pregnancy, 1.4 million visit private 
physicians.11 Men who require counseling are also seen 
frequently in the primary care setting.
 
Since clinicians have access to a large proportion of 
persons at risk for unintended pregnancy, counseling 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods could have a 
significant public health impact if performed effectively. 
It has been estimated that as many as one-third of all 
unintended pregnancies and 500,000 abortions could be 
prevented if the proportion of women not using 
contraception were reduced by half.42
 
There is only limited information, however, on the 
effectiveness of clinician counseling in altering sexual 
behavior. Clearly, the effectiveness of counseling depends 
on the age, level of maturity, sex, parity, and medical 
history of the patient, as well as on the level of 
training, clinical practice setting, and counseling skills 
of the provider. However, the effectiveness of counseling 
has been studied primarily in the context of sex education 
in schools and family planning clinics. Such studies have 
found that young women who attend a sex education course in 
school use contraceptives more effectively,43-45 but the 
designs of these studies do not permit the conclusion that 
sex education itself is responsible for the outcome or that 
sex education performed by clinicians is equally as 
effective. Clinical interventions in family planning 
clinics appear to be beneficial in preventing unintended 
adolescent pregnancy. Studies in family planning clinics 
have demonstrated a correlation between levels of 
contraceptive compliance and certain characteristics of the 
patient-provider relationship.46 Adolescents living in 
communities with subsidized family planning services are 
less likely to become pregnant than those living 
elsewhere.47 Teenage attendance at family planning clinics 
has been associated with increased use of oral 
contraceptives, decreased use of barrier and rhythm 
methods, and dramatic reductions in unprotected sexual 
intercourse.48 Pregnancy rates have also been shown to 
decrease for adolescents attending schools adjacent to 
adolescent health clinics (see below).49 In general, 
however, clinic attenders are self-selected, and in many 
the effects of counseling are short-lived. In one study, 
only 66% of adolescents attending a family planning clinic 
were compliant at a three-month follow-up visit, and less 
than one-half were compliant after a year.50 Attempts by 
family planning clinics to improve compliance through 
family counseling and increased telephone contact with 
patients have met with limited success.51
  Since the causes of unintended pregnancy are complex, it 
has been suggested that only limited effectiveness can be 
achieved by providing information or prescribing 
contraceptives without also providing patients with the 
psychological tools to use these methods. To help 
adolescents confront social pressures, it may be important 
to expand counseling beyond sex education to emphasize life 
option'' skills in decisionmaking, assertiveness, and 
interpersonal communication with peers.52 Another strategy 
directed at unintended teenage pregnancy is the emergence 
of the adolescent health clinic, in which family planning 
services are provided as a component of a comprehensive 
program of health care and psychological support for 
teens.53 The establishment of such clinics in secondary 
schools has been associated with a decrease in local 
fertility rates.54 One program, with two clinics adjacent 
to a high school and a middle school, reported a 30% 
decline in conceptions, despite a 58% increase in 
adolescent pregnancies at control schools.49 Organized 
community-wide initiatives have also proved highly 
successful in preventing unintended adolescent 
pregnancy.55
 
Recommendations of Others
 
The Canadian Task Force and many other groups recommend the 
inclusion of counseling to prevent unwanted pregnancy in 
the periodic health examination of adolescents.56 The 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists57 and 
the Society for Adolescent Medicine58 have issued specific 
recommendations for counseling adolescents on contraceptive 
techniques to prevent unwanted pregnancy. These groups also 
encourage physicians to protect the confidentiality of the 
doctor-adolescent relationship within the confines of local 
legal requirements regarding parental consent. The subject 
of unwanted adolescent pregnancy also has been the subject 
of an extensive report by the National Research Council.59 
Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recently 
issued guidelines for counseling adolescents about 
contraception and pregnancy.60
 
Discussion
 
The effectiveness of the clinician in preventing unintended 
pregnancy depends in part on the clinician's sensitivity to 
the personal concerns and privacy of the patient. These 
issues are especially important when addressing issues of 
sexuality with adolescents. The presentation of a 
nonjudgmental and understanding attitude and the 
performance of the physical examination without the parents 
present are cornerstones of this approach. Many physicians, 
especially pediatricians and general practitioners, are 
reluctant to prescribe contraceptives for adolescents 
without parental consent.61 Legislation in some states 
requires parental notification before treating a minor. At 
the same time, physicians have a professional obligation to 
protect the well-being of the adolescent and the 
confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship.62 A 
practice of informing parents may act as a disincentive for 
sexually active adolescents in need of professional 
assistance. After the cost of an office visit, concern that 
a physician will inform parents is the most common reason 
adolescents cite for choosing family planning clinics over 
private physicians to obtain contraceptive care,63 and 
presumably many more choose not to contact any facility. 
Family planning services are obtained from private 
physicians by 73% of women aged 29 and older, but by only 
48% of teenagers.64 For these reasons, some states 
specifically exempt contraception and pregnancy-related 
care from notification requirements. It is important for 
clinicians to give careful consideration to each of these 
factors when making decisions about the notification of 
parents.
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Clinicians should obtain a detailed sexual history from all 
adolescent and adult patients, male and female. For 
sexually active patients, the interview should include a 
discussion of the sexual practices and feelings of the 
patient and partner(s), as well as an assessment of the 
level of patient concern about the risk of unintended 
pregnancy. Based on this information, the clinician should 
provide appropriate counseling on the level of risk 
associated with the patient's current contraceptive 
techniques and, when indicated, available alternatives for 
more effective prevention. Clear instructions should be 
provided for the proper use of recommended contraceptive 
techniques. Oral contraceptives and barrier methods (with 
spermicides) should be recommended as the most effective 
means of reducing risk in sexually active persons, and 
complete sexual abstinence as the most effective method 
overall. Sexual abstinence and the maintenance of a 
mutually faithful monogamous sexual relationship should be 
emphasized as two important measures to reduce the risk of 
sexually transmitted diseases (see Chapter 53). Patients 
who engage in sexual activity with multiple partners or 
with persons who may be infected with sexually transmitted 
organisms should be advised to use condoms and instructed 
in their proper use (see Chapter 53).
 
Empathy, confidentiality, and a nonjudgmental supportive 
attitude are especially important when discussing issues of 
sexuality with adolescents. Clinicians should involve young 
pubertal patients and, where appropriate, their parents in 
early, open discussion of sexual development and effective 
methods to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted diseases. Sexually abstinent adolescents should 
be encouraged to remain abstinent, and they should also be 
given support in asserting themselves in the event of an 
unwelcome or coercive sexual relationship. They should be 
encouraged to obtain counseling on the proper use of 
contraceptives if they plan to begin engaging in sexual 
intercourse. Adolescents should be examined without their 
parent(s) present. Clinicians providing birth control 
services for minors should take into consideration both the 
confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship as well 
as local legal restrictions when making decisions 
pertaining to the notification of parents. The optimal 
frequency of counseling to prevent unintended pregnancy has 
not been determined and is left to clinical discretion.

Recommendation
 
Clinicians should counsel all patients to engage in a 
program of regular physical activity, tailored to their 
health status and personal lifestyle.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Physical inactivity has been associated with a number of 
debilitating medical conditions in the United States, 
including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, 
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and 
osteoporosis.  CAD is the leading cause of death in the 
United States, accounting for about 1.5 million myocardial 
infarctions and over 520,000 deaths each year.1,2  About 
400,000 Americans are victims of sudden death each year, 
due primarily to underlying atherosclerotic disease.  
Hypertension, which occurs in up to 58 million Americans,3 
is a leading risk factor for CAD, as well as for other 
serious diseases such as renal disease, retinopathy, and 
stroke.  Cerebrovascular disease alone accounts for about 
150,000 deaths each year and is the third leading cause of 
death in the United States.1  NIDDM is an important risk 
factor for CAD, cerebrovascular disease, retinopathy, and 
hypertension.  Nearly 6 million Americans suffer from 
NIDDM.4  Osteoporosis is responsible for an estimated 1.3 
million fractures each year.5  About one-quarter of all 
women over age 60 have spinal compression fractures, and 
about 15% of women sustain hip fractures during their 
lifetime.6,7  There is a 15-20% reduction in expected 
survival in the first year following a hip fracture.8  Hip 
fractures cost the United States over $7 billion each year 
in direct and indirect costs.9  

Efficacy of Risk Reduction
 
Studies have shown that men who are physically active on a 
regular basis have a lower overall mortality than those who 
are physically inactive.10,11  Exercise appears to be 
especially effective in improving health status in six 
disease-specific areas:  CAD, hypertension, obesity, NIDDM, 
osteoporosis, and diminished psychological well-being.
 
Physically inactive persons are twice as likely to develop 
CAD as are persons who engage in regular physical 
activity.12  Evidence from cohort studies has shown a 
consistent association between physical activity and 
reduced incidence of CAD.11,13,14  Similar benefits from 
exercise have been reported in older men (up to age 
75);15,16 efficacy in women is presumed on the basis of 
extrapolation.  Studies have also shown that exercise may 
have a beneficial effect on plasma lipoprotein 
concentrations.17  A possible criticism of the apparent 
benefits of exercise is that those who are physically 
active are at decreased risk for CAD by virtue of 
self-selection--that is, persons who choose to exercise may 
be inherently more healthy and have fewer overall risk 
factors for CAD.  However, studies controlling for such 
confounding variables have found that the effects of 
exercise are independent of other CAD risk factors, and 
that the cardiovascular benefits may even be augmented in 
the presence of other risk factors for CAD.16,18  It has 
also been shown that the type of individual who adopts 
athletic behavior is not protected from CAD if regular 
exercise is discontinued.  A study of former college 
athletes who had become physically inactive found that CAD 
risk in this cohort was similar to that of inactive alumni 
who had not been college athletes.19
 
Regular exercise is an important means of improving caloric 
balance and preventing obesity.  A large body of 
epidemiologic evidence supports an association between 
physical activity and weight control, even after 
controlling for dietary factors.20  The contribution of 
physical activity to daily caloric expenditure is often 
relatively small.  For example, a daily one-mile walk may 
amount to only a 4% contribution to total daily 
expenditure.  However, weight gain often occurs as a result 
of small differences between caloric intake and 
expenditures, and therefore it is possible through regular 
exercise to achieve a caloric balance that prevents 
progressive increases in weight.  Although exercise may 
increase caloric intake, it is accompanied by an even 
greater increase in caloric expenditure, so that a negative 
caloric balance is maintained.21
 
Exercise may reduce the risk of developing hypertension and 
NIDDM.  Cohort studies suggest that physically inactive 
persons have a 35-52% greater risk of developing 
hypertension than those who exercise; this effect appears 
to be independent of other risk factors for 
hypertension.22,23  The average reduction in blood pressure 
achieved through regular exercise has been estimated to be 
about 10 mm Hg.24  Physical activity is also associated 
with increased insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance, 
and epidemiologic studies of South Pacific natives suggest 
that differences in physical activity may have contributed 
to the increased prevalence of NIDDM in this 
population.25,26  Further evidence is needed, however, to 
prove that exercise improves glucose tolerance or that it 
reduces the risk of developing NIDDM.27
 
Weight-bearing physical activity may also reduce bone loss 
in postmenopausal women.28-34  Further research is needed 
to prove that bone mineral content is improved sufficiently 
to reduce the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures.  
Although studies suggest the risk of hip fractures is lower 
in persons who exercise regularly,35,36 prospective 
evidence is necessary to prove that this effect is due 
specifically to exercise.  Additional studies are also 
needed to determine whether the risk of fall-related 
fractures during exercise offsets the intended benefits of 
preventing osteoporosis.
 
A commonly mentioned benefit of regular exercise is 
improved affect (positive mood, reduced depression, lowered 
anxiety).37,38  The nature of the relationship between 
exercise and mental health is poorly understood.  It is 
known that physically active persons report higher levels 
of self-esteem, perhaps in response to improved personal 
appearance and self-image.  No well-designed studies have 
shown that the incidence of clinically confirmed 
psychiatric disorders can be reduced through exercise.39  

Most studies have used different definitions for physical 
activity,40 and therefore it is not clear from the evidence 
exactly what form of exercise is most beneficial.  To 
improve cardiovascular fitness, it is known that exercise 
cannot be performed occasionally or seasonally,41 nor can 
one expect protection from CAD by having exercised 
regularly in the past.19  The cardiovascular effects at 
increasing levels of exercise intensity appear to operate 
in a dose-response relationship, with modest benefits at 
low energy expenditures (150-500 kcal/week) and maximal 
benefits at higher levels (2000-3500 kcal/week).10,19  
Small increases in activity among the most inactive persons 
appear to be associated with the largest magnitudes of risk 
reduction.  It has traditionally been thought that an 
improvement in cardiovascular fitness requires a threshold 
level of aerobic intensity during an exercise session and a 
minimum frequency of sessions, and this has served as the 
basis for a number of similar exercise criteria.  Three of 
these include:  (1) dynamic movement of large muscle groups 
for at least 20 minutes, three or more days per week, 
performed at an intensity of at least 60% of 
cardiorespiratory capacity; (2) intensity of 50-100% of 
cardiorespiratory capacity, frequency of two to four times 
per week, duration of 15-45 minutes, program length of 5-11 
weeks; and (3) achieving and maintaining a pulse rate equal 
to the formula: (220 - age) x 70%.42,43
 
It has also become clear that many of the health benefits 
of exercise may be obtained even at lower intensity and 
frequency levels.  Furthermore, vigorous exercise may not 
be advisable in some individuals, especially those who are 
at increased risk of injury or cardiovascular complications 
from vigorous physical activity (e.g., the elderly).  A 
number of studies suggest that the threshold intensity for 
improving cardiovascular fitness may be lower than 
previously thought and that activities such as brisk 
walking, climbing stairs, and gardening can be 
beneficial.11,18,40,41,44  These benefits have been 
validated in studies of low intensity activity in elderly 
persons44-47 and those with poor baseline fitness.43  
Inactive persons, as well as those who are hypertensive or 
obese, can benefit significantly from even modest increases 
in physical activity.  In addition, as described above, 
persons who engage in low intensity exercise may also enjoy 
the benefits of exercise other than those relating to CAD; 
these include improved strength and flexibility (which may 
reduce the risk of falls in the elderly; see Chapter 52), 
increased bone density, and improved mood.  

The benefits of exercise must be weighed against its 
potential adverse effects, which include injury, 
osteoarthritis, and, rarely, sudden death.  Although 
injuries are commonly reported in competitive sports, there 
are few reliable data on the incidence of injuries during 
typical noncontact exercises.48,49  It is currently thought 
that most injuries during exercise are preventable.  They 
often occur as a result of excessive levels of physical 
activity, dramatic incremental changes in activity level 
(especially in persons with poor baseline fitness), and 
improper exercise techniques or equipment.  A second 
concern is that long-term physical activity may accelerate 
the development of osteoarthritis in major weight-bearing 
joints (e.g., hips, knees).  Cross-sectional studies in 
long-distance runners, however, have been unable to 
demonstrate a strong association between exercise and 
osteoarthritis.50-52  A third concern is the risk of sudden 
death, which is known to be increased during vigorous 
physical activity.53  Studies suggest that sedentary 
persons who engage in vigorous activity are at greater risk 
for sudden death than are those who are regularly active.54 
 In fact, due to the cardiovascular benefits of exercise, 
the overall risk of sudden death (both during and not 
during exercise) in men who engage regularly in high levels 
of physical activity is considerably lower than in 
sedentary men.54  

Effectiveness of Counseling
 
At least 40% of the U.S. population is considered 
sedentary, and as many as 80-94% fail to exercise at an 
adequate level to obtain cardiorespiratory benefit.55,56  
Thus, the majority of patients seen by physicians could 
potentially benefit from encouragement to increase physical 
activity levels.  There is, however, a limited amount of 
information regarding the ability of physicians to 
influence the exercise behavior of patients.  Studies that 
have demonstrated benefits from counseling provide little 
information about long-term compliance and are of limited 
generalizability, because the form of counseling, type of 
patients, or clinical setting have not been representative 
of typical primary care physician counseling of healthy 
patients.57-63  It is known from surveys, however, that 
negative perceptions of exercise activity (e.g., 
inconvenience, cost of equipment, discomfort) can often act 
as powerful disincentives.64,65  In particular, 
high-intensity activities and greater perceived exertion 
are major barriers to adherence to physical activity 
programs, especially in sedentary persons over the age of 
35.  Persons most likely to adopt vigorous exercise 
programs are those already exercising at a moderate 
level.65
 
Recommendations of Others
 
Although counseling patients to exercise is widely 
recognized as clinically prudent, there are few official 
recommendations for physicians to include exercise 
counseling in the periodic health examination.  The 
American College of Sports Medicine has issued specific 
guidelines on the medical contraindications to exercise.66
 
Discussion
 
Despite the absence of direct evidence that physician 
counseling can increase the physical activity of 
asymptomatic patients, the intervention is warranted 
because of the numerous potential health benefits 
associated with physical activity.  Physical inactivity 
results in a slightly lower relative risk for CAD than the 
commonly accepted risk factors of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking, but it is a 
much more common cardiac risk factor in the U.S. 
population.67  Physical inactivity is also a risk factor 
for other serious diseases, such as hypertension and 
obesity.  Thus, from a population perspective, even modest 
increases in physical activity levels could have large 
public health implications.67
 
Nonetheless, it is important for clinicians to use 
discretion in recommending appropriate forms of physical 
activity for patients.  In addition to considering 
potential contraindications in persons with underlying 
medical disorders, it is also necessary to design an 
exercise program with an awareness of potential barriers to 
compliance in the patient's personal lifestyle.  Since some 
patients will be unable or unwilling to engage in any high 
intensity activities, recommending low intensity exercise 
for certain individuals may ultimately achieve greater 
health benefits than urging vigorous exercise activities.  
Brisk walking, for example, offers improved cardiovascular 
fitness along with the compliance-enhancing features of 
convenience, lower perceived discomfort, and safety.  The 
addition of a strong arm swing (aerobic or "pace" walking), 
although slightly more difficult technically, is a simple 
measure to increase the aerobic activity of walking.
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Clinicians should provide all patients with information on 
the role of physical activity in disease prevention and 
assist in selecting an appropriate type of exercise.  
Factors that should be considered in designing a program 
include medical limitations and activity characteristics 
that both improve health (e.g., weight-bearing, increased 
caloric expenditure, enhanced cardiovascular fitness, low 
potential adverse effects) and enhance compliance (e.g., 
low perceived exertion, cost, inconvenience).  The patient 
should also be given instructions on how to perform the 
exercise safely to reduce the risk of injuries.  The 
patient should be encouraged to set at least one specific 
exercise goal; the initial target should be only a small 
increment above baseline status.  Beginners should 
emphasize regular, rather than vigorous, exercise; an 
appropriate short-term goal is to engage in regular walking 
at least three times per week for at least 30 minutes.  
Ultimately, over a period of several months, the patient 
should progress to a level that achieves increased 
cardiovascular fitness (e.g., 30 minutes of daily brisk 
walking).  For most healthy persons, maximum cardiovascular 
fitness can be achieved by a program of vigorous aerobic 
exercise for 15-45 minutes, two to four times per week, 
during which a pulse rate of about (220 - age) x 70% is 
reached and maintained.  Clinicians who are unable to 
design an effective exercise program may wish to refer 
patients to an accredited fitness center or exercise 
specialist.

Recommendation:
 
 All patients should be encouraged to visit a dental care 
provider on a regular basis. Primary care clinicians should 
counsel patients regarding daily tooth brushing and dental 
flossing, the appropriate use of fluoride for caries 
prevention, avoiding sugary foods, and risk factors for 
developing baby bottle tooth decay. Children living in 
communities with inadequate water fluoridation should 
receive appropriate dietary fluoride supplements. While 
examining the mouth, clinicians should be alert for obvious 
signs of oral disease (see Clinical Intervention). Oral 
cancer is discussed in Chapter 15.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
A large proportion of the population of the United States 
suffers from dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal 
(gum and bone) disease. Although the prevalence of dental 
caries among school-aged children has declined in recent 
years, the average schoolchild has at least 1 cavity in 
permanent teeth by age 9, 2.6 cavities by age 12, and 8 by 
age 17.1,2 About one-quarter have five or more decayed, 
missing, or filled teeth. The average adult in the United 
States has 10-17 decayed, missing, or filled permanent 
teeth.3,4 Nearly half of all employed adults have 
gingivitis (gum inflammation), and periodontitis 
(inflammation of the gums and bone supporting the teeth) 
has been experienced to some degree by 80%.4 Ninety-five 
percent of the elderly have periodontitis, with more than 
one-third experiencing moderate to severe periodontal 
disease (i.e., 6 mm attachment loss).4 It has been 
estimated that as many as 4-15% of American adults, and 
over 40% of the elderly, are edentulous.4,5 Each year in 
the United States, dental conditions account for about 11 
million days of restricted activity, 4 million days of bed 
disability, 2 million lost workdays, and over 1 million 
days of lost school.6 Dental expenditures in the United 
States approached $30 billion in 1986.7 Dental disease is 
more common in persons whose personal behaviors (e.g., 
smoking, alcohol abuse), medications, or coexisting medical 
illnesses (e.g., diabetes mellitus, xerostomia) increase 
the risk of oral pathology. With the aging of the 
population, a growing number of older Americans are 
experiencing medical disorders and taking medications that 
affect their oral health.8
 
Efficacy of Risk Reduction
 
Personal oral disease prevention practices can reduce the 
risk of developing caries and periodontal disease. These 
measures include regular use of fluoride, reduced dietary 
intake of foods containing refined sugars, and tooth 
brushing and flossing. The incidence of caries has been 
reduced significantly by the fluoridation of community 
water supplies.9 However, only 87% of the U.S. population 
is served by community water supplies, and only 64% of 
these communities have optimally fluoridated water.10 In 
locations where adequate community water fluoridation is 
not available, the risk of caries can be reduced by 
providing alternate sources of fluoride.11-14 These include 
systemic (e.g., school water fluoridation, fluoride 
tablets, drops) and topical (e.g., fluoridated mouth 
rinses, professional fluoride treatment) forms. Also, 
virtually all toothpastes sold in the United States contain 
fluoride that has been proved to be effective in reducing 
the incidence of caries by about 20-40%.15-17 Reduced 
intake of certain dietary carbohydrates, especially refined 
sugars, may lower the risk of developing caries. Studies in 
the 1950s and 1960s conducted in institutionalized settings 
suggest that diets containing large amounts of sucrose and 
other sugary foods are associated with a higher incidence 
of caries.18,19 The correlation has been more difficult to 
demonstrate in more recent studies, in which dietary intake 
was less carefully controlled,20,21 but it is widely held 
that the consumption of sugary foods, especially between 
meals, is cariogenic. For ethical reasons, definitive 
studies to prove a causal relationship between diet and 
carious lesions are unlikely to be performed in the 
future.
 
Improper infant feeding practices are another source of 
caries in young children, especially in those who regularly 
fall asleep sucking the nipple of a baby bottle containing 
an acidic or cariogenic beverage (fruit juice, milk, 
formula). Prolonged pooling of these liquids around the 
anterior primary teeth (baby incisors) can cause extensive 
destruction, particularly of the primary incisors but also 
of molars.22,23 Education to curb the practice of putting 
children to bed with a bottle may decrease the risk of 
nursing bottle tooth decay.
 
It is mainly the fluoride contained in toothpastes, rather 
than tooth brushing and flossing per se, that reduces tooth 
decay.24 It has been established, however, that brushing 
and flossing can prevent the development and progression of 
periodontal disease by removing bacterial plaque 
deposits.25-27 Their efficacy, however, depends on the 
ability of the patient to keep teeth adequately 
plaque-free, and this necessitates thorough daily tooth 
brushing and cleaning between teeth with dental floss or 
other mechanical devices. Due to the difficulty many 
patients have in adopting and maintaining these habits, 
personal oral hygiene measures often fail to adequately 
remove plaque and prevent gingivitis. For this reason, it 
is also important for patients to receive regular 
professional dental care.
 
Among the most important measures performed by dentists and 
dental hygienists are primary preventive measures, such as 
prophylactic cleaning, scaling, and root planing of teeth, 
and secondary preventive maneuvers, such as careful oral 
and dental examination for the early detection of dental 
disease. Other preventive interventions include the 
application of topical fluoride28 and occlusal 
sealants29,30 to prevent caries, placement of orthodontic 
space-maintaining appliances to prevent malocclusion, and 
the early detection of oral cancer (see Chapter 15). 
Experimental studies have demonstrated that meticulous and 
very frequent dental prophylaxis can reduce the incidence 
of caries in schoolchildren,31-36 but these studies 
required an intense program of professional dental care 
that would not be feasible under typical dental practice 
conditions in the United States. Professional tooth 
cleaning can also delay progression of periodontal disease 
because the dentist or dental hygienist can remove plaque 
and tartar from subgingival areas generally not reached by 
the patient. Dental care alone, however, is inadequate to 
prevent periodontal disease. Failure by the patient to 
regularly remove plaque deposits between dental visits can 
lead to extension of supragingival plaque beneath the gum, 
bacterial recolonization of the gingival crevice, 
accumulation of calculus, and recurrent periodontitis.37 
Thus, programs combining personal oral hygiene with 
professional prophylaxis are most effective in the 
prevention of periodontal disease.25,38
  Although dental examinations and prophylaxis are widely 
recommended every year or six months, there is little 
scientific evidence that this frequency is necessary on a 
routine basis for the maintenance of oral health in 
asymptomatic persons.39 It is clear that regular 
examinations are necessary to detect and treat disease 
processes before they threaten the viability of the teeth, 
gums, and other oral soft tissues; in addition, more 
frequent visits are necessary for persons at increased risk 
by virtue of their age, risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, 
smoking, alcohol abuse), state of periodontal health, rate 
of accumulation of tartar, personal oral hygiene practices, 
and medical and dental history (e.g., diabetes mellitus, 
xerostomia, infection with human immunodeficiency virus).
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
There is little information on the effectiveness of 
physician advice in changing oral hygiene habits, 
increasing the optimal use of fluoride supplements, or 
increasing patient visits to dentists. It is well known 
among dentists, however, that patients frequently face 
difficulties in complying with guidelines for proper tooth 
brushing and dental flossing without repeated 
reinforcement. Recommendations to limit intake of foods 
containing refined sugars and between-meal sweet snacks are 
especially problematic for children. There is little 
information regarding the willingness or ability of 
patients to comply with physician advice to visit the 
dentist for a routine checkup.
 
In communities with inadequate water fluoridation, primary 
care physicians are an important source of supplemental 
fluoride drops or tablets to prevent dental caries in 
children. There is little information on patient compliance 
with such prescriptions. Studies have shown, however, that 
physicians often fail to prescribe dietary fluoride 
supplements in accordance with existing guidelines.40
 
Recommendations of Others
 
The Canadian Task Force recommends an annual examination 
for caries, orthodontic conditions, and periodontal disease 
and annual counseling to perform daily oral hygiene 
beginning at age 12; the dental examination should include 
visual and tactile inspection and, when appropriate, dental 
x-rays.41 The American Dental Association (ADA) advises 
that the frequency of dental examinations be tailored to 
the individual.42 Both the ADA43 and the American Academy 
of Pediatrics44 have issued guidelines on the prescription 
of dietary fluoride supplements for children in areas with 
inadequate water fluoridation.
 
Discussion
 
Although there is little scientific evidence that physician 
counseling can reduce the incidence of dental diseases such 
as caries and periodontal disease, it is reasonable to 
provide patients with information about proven methods to 
reduce the risk of developing these potentially painful and 
disfiguring conditions. There is sufficient evidence of 
benefit to justify efforts by physicians and other health 
care professionals to encourage frequent tooth brushing, 
daily dental flossing, appropriate use of fluorides, and 
periodic visits to the dentist. There is, however, little 
evidence that this form of counseling must be performed 
frequently, or that annual or semiannual dental checkups 
are necessary for persons without clinical evidence of 
dental disease. Although it is likely that consuming fewer 
foods containing refined sugars or avoiding between-meal 
sweets will reduce the incidence of dental caries, this has 
not been demonstrated in a controlled prospective study. 
Nonetheless, it is clinically prudent to recommend these 
dietary changes. Finally, clinicians can offer advice 
regarding effective measures to reduce the risk of 
developing oral cancer, such as discontinuing the use of 
tobacco products and reducing the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages (see Chapter 15).
 
Clinical Intervention
 
All patients should be encouraged to visit the dentist on a 
regular basis. The optimal frequency of visits should be 
determined by the patient's dentist; for most healthy 
patients, a dental checkup once every one to two years is 
sufficient. All patients should also be encouraged to brush 
their teeth daily with a fluoride-containing toothpaste. 
Adolescents and adults should be advised to clean 
thoroughly between the teeth with dental floss each day. 
Those persons with a history of frequent caries may benefit 
from reduced intake of foods containing refined sugars and 
by avoiding sugary between-meal snacks. Pregnant women, 
parents, and caregivers of young children should be 
counseled to put children to bed without a bottle and to 
substitute a cup for the bottle when the child reaches 1 
year of age. If the child must have a bottle, it should be 
filled with water.
 
In accordance with existing guidelines,43,44 children 
living in an area with inadequate water fluoridation (less 
than 0.7 parts per million [ppm]) should be prescribed 
daily fluoride drops or tablets. Fluoride tablets should be 
prescribed for children over age 3; the recommended dose is 
1 mg/day if the community water fluoride concentration is 
less than 0.3 ppm, and 0.50 mg/day if the concentration is 
0.3-0.7 ppm. For children 2 to 3 years of age, the 
corresponding doses are 0.50 mg/day and 0.25 mg/day, 
respectively, and either drops or tablets are appropriate. 
Children under age 2 should be treated with fluoride drops 
if the water concentration is less than 0.3 ppm; the 
recommended dose is 0.25 mg/day.
 
When examining the mouth, clinicians should be alert for 
obvious signs of untreated tooth decay, inflamed or 
cyanotic gingiva, loose teeth, and severe halitosis. 
Screening for oral cancer should be performed for high-risk 
groups (see Chapter 15), and all patients should be 
counseled regarding the use of tobacco products (Chapter 
48). Children should also be examined for evidence of baby 
bottle tooth decay, mismatching of upper and lower dental 
arches, crowding or malalignment of the teeth, premature 
loss of primary posterior teeth (baby molars), and obvious 
mouth breathing. Patients with these or other suspected 
abnormalities should be referred to their dentist for 
further evaluation.

Recommendation:
 
All children without established contraindications should 
receive diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), oral poliovirus 
(OPV), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), and conjugate 
Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines in accordance with 
recommended schedules (see Clinical Intervention). A 
tetanus-diph
 
Burden of Suffering
 
A number of infectious diseases are almost completely 
preventable through routine childhood immunizations. These 
include diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, measles, mumps, 
and rubella. Largely as a result of widespread childhood 
vaccination, these diseases have become considerably less 
common in the United States than in prevaccination years. A 
comparison of the total number of reported cases in the 
United States in 1987 and in the years preceding 
vaccination reveals an impressive decrease in reported 
cases of measles (from 481,530 [1962] to 3655 cases), 
pertussis (from 74,715 [1948] to 2823 cases), diphtheria 
(from 9493 [1948] to 3 cases), tetanus (from 601 [1948] to 
48 cases), and paralytic poliomyelitis (from 18,308 [1954] 
to 5 cases).1 Before the introduction of poliovirus vaccine 
in 1955, this disease occurred in epidemic waves of 
increasing magnitude, reaching a peak incidence of more 
than 20,000 paralytic cases in 1952.2 The last outbreak in 
1979, however, totaled only 10 paralytic cases.3 Systemic 
illness from Haemophilus influenzae type b occurs before 
age 5 in about 1 out of every 200 children born in the 
United States.4 Severe systemic complications include 
meningitis, the most common clinical presentation in 
children, as well as pneumonia, arthritis, epiglottitis, 
and cellulitis.
 
Efficacy of Vaccines
 
The efficacy of the DTP and MMR vaccines are well 
established on the basis of clinical studies and decades of 
experience with universal childhood immunization.5-7 
Although a single dose of MMR is highly protective, a 
two-stage vaccination protocol against measles may be 
necessary in areas with recurrent measles transmission.8 
The MMR vaccine is associated with rare adverse effects. 
Approximately one case of encephalitis or encephalopathy 
has been reported in temporal association with vaccination 
for every million doses of measles-containing vaccines 
distributed.9 Increased attention has focused in recent 
years on the safety of the pertussis vaccine.10 The 
whole-cell preparation, which confers 80-90% protection 
after three doses, produces serious adverse events such as 
seizures and hypotonic/hyporesponsive episodes in 1 out of 
1750 doses.11 The risk of seizures may be higher in certain 
children, such as those with a personal history or family 
history of seizures.12 However, limited follow-up of such 
cases suggests most if not all are associated with benign 
outcomes.13 Very rarely (1/140,000 doses), 
pertussis-containing vaccines have been associated with 
more severe neurologic illnesses, including encephalopathy, 
which may result in permanent brain damage (1/330,000 
doses).14 The incidence of serious neurologic disorders 
following DTP administration is substantially less than 
that following pertussis disease.14 Acellular forms of 
pertussis vaccine with fewer side effects are being 
evaluated as alternatives, but it is currently not known if 
they are as effective as whole cell vaccines.15,16
 
The oral attenuated live poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) offers 
95-100% protection against poliovirus. As a result, disease 
caused by wild poliovirus has been virtually eliminated in 
the United States. However, 1 out of every 2.6 million 
vaccine doses results in paralytic poliomyelitis.3 Most 
cases of endemic disease in the United States since 1981 
(about eight cases per year) have been associated with the 
vaccine.3 The development and recent licensing of 
enhanced-potency inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV), 
which is not known to carry this risk and appears to have 
comparable immunogenicity,17,18 has led some to recommend 
replacement of the live vaccine with this product. IPV may 
be less effective, however, in limiting transmission of 
wild poliovirus among susceptible members of the 
population.3 To take advantage of the properties of both 
vaccines, the Institute of Medicine has recently 
recommended consideration of a schedule consisting of two 
or more doses of IPV followed by OPV, once a combined 
preparation of DTP and IPV becomes available.19
 
The efficacy of a capsular polysaccharide vaccine in 
preventing infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b in 
children over age 2 was first demonstrated in Finland in 
1984.20 The polysaccharide vaccine had limited efficacy in 
children under 18 months of age and questionable efficacy 
in those aged 18-24 months. Subsequent studies in the 
United States have produced inconsistent and occasionally 
conflicting results in attempts to confirm the efficacy of 
the polysaccharide vaccine and the optimal age for its 
administration.21-26 The uncertain performance 
characteristics of the vaccine in children under 2 years of 
age is of significance because three-quarters of all 
systemic illnesses occur in this age group. A more 
immunogenic conjugate vaccine recently has been 
demonstrated in Finland to have 87% efficacy in children 
less than 12 months of age.27 Based on its superior 
immunogenicity, the conjugate vaccine has been licensed in 
the United States for use in children 18 months of age or 
older.28,29 Its use in American infants will have to await 
the results of confirmatory studies.
 
Recommendations of Others
 
Detailed recommendations on the administration of childhood 
vaccines are issued regularly by the Immunization Practices 
Advisory Committee30 and the American Academy of 
Pediatrics.9 In recent years, the Immunization Practices 
Advisory Committee has also issued specific updates on the 
use of DTP vaccine;6,31 IPV;18 measles vaccine;7,8 and 
Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide and conjugate 
vaccines.28-29,32-33 These recommendations have recently 
been combined in one report.34
 
Clinical Intervention
 
The recommended childhood immunization schedule30 includes 
DTP vaccine along with trivalent OPV at ages 2 months, 4 
months, 6 months (DTP only), 15 months, and finally between 
ages 4 and 6 years just prior to school entry. MMR vaccine 
should be administered at age 15 months, and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b conjugate vaccine should be given at 18 
months of age. In areas with recurrent measles 
transmission, such as counties or cities reporting more 
than five cases among preschool-aged children during each 
of the previous five years, monovalent measles vaccine 
should be administered at 9 months of age (or first visit 
thereafter) in addition to administering MMR vaccine at age 
15 months. A Td booster should be administered at age 14-16 
years and every 10 years thereafter. Clinicians are 
referred to published guidelines for details on vaccine

Recommendation:
 
 Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered at least once 
and influenza vaccine should be administered annually to 
all persons aged 65 and older and to persons in selected 
high-risk groups (see Clinical Intervention). Hepatitis B 
vaccine should be offered to homosexually active men, 
intravenous drug users, and others at high risk for 
infection (see Clinical Intervention). Recommendations for 
persons with possible percutaneous or sexual exposure to 
persons infected with hepatitis B virus are in Chapter 58 
(see also Chapter 20). All adults should receive 
tetanus-diphtheria toxoid boosters at least once every 10 
years. Vaccination against measles and mumps should be 
provided to all adults who lack evidence of immunity. 
Recommendations for rubella immunization are provided in 
Chapter 36.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Pneumococcal disease and influenza are significant causes 
of morbidity and mortality in the United States. 
Pneumococcal disease accounts for about 40,000 deaths each 
year,1 and pneumococcal pneumonia is fatal in 5% of 
patients.2-4 Bacteremia occurs in 20% of patients with 
pneumococcal pneumonia and has a mortality of 
20-40%.2,3,5,6 Influenza, which frequently causes 
incapacitating malaise for several days, is responsible for 
significant morbidity and decreased productivity during 
epidemics. Ten thousand or more excess deaths have been 
documented in 19 different epidemics during 1957-1986; more 
than 40,000 excess deaths occurred in each of several 
recent influenza epidemics.7 During severe pandemics (e.g., 
1957 and 1968), there are often high attack rates across 
all age groups, and mortality is usually markedly 
increased. Elderly persons and persons with underlying 
medical disorders are at increased risk for complications 
from both pneumococcal and influenza infections. About 
80-90% of all reported deaths from influenza occur among 
persons aged 65 and older.7
 
Measles, a childhood illness, occurred in 486 American 
adults (aged 20 or older) in 1987.8 Adult cases accounted 
for nearly 15% of all reported cases.8 About 40% of adult 
infections occur among persons aged 20-24,8 often in places 
where young adults congregate, such as college campuses.9
 
Over 300,000 persons become infected with hepatitis B virus 
each year, and more than 10,000 require 
hospitalization.10,11 An estimated 500,000 to 1 million 
persons in the United States are chronic carriers of 
hepatitis B virus.11 About one-quarter of them develop 
chronic active hepatitis, and this often progresses to 
cirrhosis.11 An estimated 4000 hepatitis B-related deaths 
occur each year as a result of cirrhosis, and more than 
1000 occur as a result of liver cancer.1,11
 
Largely as a result of routine immunization, tetanus and 
diphtheria have become uncommon diseases in the United 
States; only 48 cases of tetanus and 3 cases of diphtheria 
were reported in 1987.8 In 1948, before tetanus and 
diphtheria toxoids were widely introduced, there were over 
600 cases of tetanus and about 9500 cases of diphtheria in 
the United States. Although uncommon, tetanus remains a 
serious infection, with death occurring in 26-31% of 
cases.12 The case-fatality ratio (proportion of cases 
resulting in death) is greater than 30% for persons aged 50 
and older, who account for over two-thirds of all cases.
 
Efficacy of Vaccines
 
The 14-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, which 
was licensed in 1977, was replaced in 1983 by a 23-valent 
polysaccharide vaccine.2 The latter contains purified 
capsular materials from 88% of the strains of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae causing bacteremic pneumococcal disease reported 
in the United States.13 The efficacy of pneumococcal 
vaccine in the U.S. population has not been determined with 
certainty. Although it appeared to be effective in 
controlled trials during the 1970s involving high-risk 
populations in other countries,14,15 controlled trials in 
the United States involving older adults have failed to 
demonstrate protective efficacy.16 The relatively low 
incidence of pneumococcal infection in healthy U.S. adults 
makes efficacy difficult to establish in a prospective 
clinical trial. Case-control studies and studies comparing 
the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in the blood of 
vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, which have been much 
more feasible to perform, support the protective value of 
pneumococcal vaccine, with estimates of 60-70% efficacy 
reported in immunocompetent recipients.17-20 Other studies, 
including a randomized placebo-controlled trial, have found 
the vaccine to have more limited efficacy.21,22 Additional 
research is needed to obtain more definitive data on the 
efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine. There is, however, little 
evidence of serious adverse effects from this vaccine, 
although erythema and pain at the injection site occur in 
about half of patients. Fever, myalgias, and severe 
reactions occur in no more than 1% of patients.13,23 The 
total duration of antibody protection is unknown; elevated 
titers appear to persist in adults for at least 5 years 
after immunization but, in some persons, they may fall to 
prevaccination levels within 10 years.13
 
Influenza vaccine containing antigens identical or similar 
to currently circulating influenza A and B viruses has been 
shown in controlled studies to be 70-80% effective.24 
Although no controlled clinical trials have studied the 
vaccine in the high-risk groups for whom it is generally 
recommended, retrospective studies support its efficacy in 
elderly high-risk populations.25,26 Because of frequent 
seasonal variation in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase 
antigens of circulating viruses, it is necessary to 
administer the vaccine annually in the fall so that it can 
include antigens known from recent surveillance data to be 
circulating during the season. Although allergic reactions 
have been described in patients with sensitivity to eggs, 
adverse effects from influenza vaccine are quite 
uncommon.27
 
Amantadine is 70-90% effective in preventing illness caused 
by naturally occurring strains of influenza A.7,26,28 Since 
it does not prevent influenza B infection, it is 
appropriate only in presumed influenza A epidemics. It is 
most useful as short-term prophylaxis for high-risk persons 
who have not received the vaccine or are vaccinated late, 
when the vaccine may be ineffective due to major antigenic 
changes in the virus; for unvaccinated persons who provide 
home care for high-risk persons; or to supplement 
protection provided by vaccine in persons who are expected 
to have a poor antibody response.7,29 It may also be useful 
throughout the epidemic period for some high-risk patients 
in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. Amantadine 
occasionally produces insomnia, nausea, dizziness, and 
impaired concentration, and it has been associated with 
falls in the elderly.7,29
 
A single dose of measles vaccine is 95% effective in 
producing long-term immunity, presumably for the life of 
the patient.30 Recent vaccine failures have been associated 
primarily with the timing of vaccination during infancy and 
early childhood.31 As childhood measles vaccination has 
become more common, the age distribution of new cases has 
shifted to older age groups, with increased incidence in 
older adolescents and young adults, primarily college 
students. Adult infections are more likely in persons who 
have not been naturally infected or properly vaccinated in 
the past. Vaccination of young adults in settings such as 
colleges and the workplace is likely to be most effective. 
Persons born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally 
infected and need not be considered susceptible.32 
Administration of combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 
vaccine is not associated with adverse effects for persons 
already immune to any of these diseases, and thus the 
combined MMR vaccine is preferable to measles vaccine since 
many recipients may also be susceptible to mumps or 
rubella. Although susceptible adolescent and young adults 
should be vaccinated against mumps, routine mumps 
vaccination is not necessary for persons in these age 
groups since most are likely already to have been infected 
naturally.33 Rubella immunization is discussed in Chapter 
36.
 
Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine, which became available 
in 1982, has 85-95% protective efficacy when administered 
in three intramuscular doses to immunocompetent 
patients.34-37 A newer vaccine, produced by recombinant DNA 
technology, was licensed in 1986 and appears to induce 
protective antibodies in more than 95% of young adult (aged 
20-39) vaccinees. Older adults generate a somewhat lower 
antibody response to both vaccines.10,11 Injection at the 
buttocks has been associated with a suboptimal immune 
response, and therefore the deltoid muscle is the preferred 
injection site. Local soreness at the injection site is a 
common side effect. Immunity from hepatitis B vaccine 
appears to last at least seven years. The possible need for 
booster doses after longer intervals will be assessed as 
additional data become available.
 
Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid (Td) is highly effective in 
producing protective antibody titers, but it requires a 
primary series of three doses, followed by booster doses 
every 10 years.38 Td often produces mild local inflammation 
and occasionally Arthus-type reactions.
 
Recommendations of Others:
 
Detailed physician guidelines on adult immunizations have 
been published by the American College of Physicians29 and 
the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee.30 These 
groups have also issued recent, updated recommendations on 
the use of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids39 and 
pneumococcal,13,40 influenza,7,27 hepatitis B,10,11 and 
measles32 vaccines. These recommendations are not 
universally accepted, however; for example, some authors 
argue against routine vaccination of the elderly against 
influenza and pneumococcal disease in the absence of known 
risk factors.41 The use of amantadine to prevent influenza 
was recommended in 1980 by a National Institutes of Health 
consensus development conference42 and has recently been 
the subject of recommendations by the Immunization 
Practices Advisory Committee.7 The American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued detailed 
guidelines on the use of vaccines during pregnancy.43
 
Discussion
 
Most adults have not been immunized in accordance with 
existing immunization guidelines.1 The cost of vaccines is 
one possible barrier to widespread immunization, but 
studies have shown that the prevention of morbidity and 
mortality from infectious diseases makes immunization cost 
effective. For example, routine pneumococcal vaccination of 
persons aged 65 and older has been estimated to cost about 
$6000 (1983 dollars) for every year of healthy life 
gained.44 Hepatitis B vaccination of high-risk groups has 
also proved to be cost-effective.45,46
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Pneumococcal vaccination should be provided at least once 
to all persons aged 65 and older and to those with medical 
conditions that increase the risk of pneumococcal infection 
(e.g., chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease, sickle cell 
disease, nephrotic syndrome, Hodgkin's disease, asplenia, 
diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, multiple myeloma, 
renal disease, and conditions associated with 
immunosuppression). Patients living in special environments 
or social settings with an identified increased risk of 
pneumococcal disease should also be vaccinated. Although 
routine revaccination is not recommended, it may be 
appropriate to consider revaccination in high-risk persons 
who have not been vaccinated for six or more years or in 
those who received the older 14-valent vaccine. Influenza 
vaccine should be administered annually to all persons aged 
65 and older, residents of chronic care facilities, and 
persons suffering from chronic cardiopulmonary disorders, 
metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), 
hemoglobinopathies, immunosuppression, or renal 
dysfunction. Health care providers for high-risk patients 
should also receive influenza vaccine. In persons at high 
risk for influenza A, amantadine prophylaxis (100 mg orally 
per day) may be started at the time of vaccination and 
continued for two weeks. If vaccine is contraindicated, 
amantadine should be started at the beginning of the 
influenza season and continued daily for the duration of 
influenza activity in the community.
 
Hepatitis B vaccine should be offered to susceptible 
individuals in high-risk groups, including homosexually 
active men, intravenous drug users, recipients of certain 
blood products, and persons in health-related jobs with 
frequent exposure to blood or blood products. The 
recommended regimen for both the plasma-derived and 
recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is to administer 10 mcg IM 
in the deltoid muscle at the time of exposure and at 1 and 
6 months following exposure. Infants born to mothers who 
are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen should be 
immunized beginning at birth (see Chapter 20). Immunization 
recommendations for persons with possible percutaneous or 
sexual exposure to individuals infected with hepatitis B 
virus are in Chapter 58.
 
All adults should receive a Td booster at least once every 
10 years. The complete series of combined 
tetanus-diphtheria toxoids should be given to patients who 
have not received a primary series.
  MMR vaccine should be administered to all persons born 
after 1956 who lack evidence of immunity to measles 
(receipt of live vaccine on or after the first birthday, 
laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of 
physician-diagnosed measles). The MMR vaccine should not be 
administered during pregnancy. Susceptible individuals 
should be vaccinated against mumps. See also Chapter 36 
regarding rubella vaccination of susceptible women of 
childbearing age.

Recommendation:
 
Although routine postmenopausal estrogen replacement is not 
recommended, estrogen therapy should be considered for 
asymptomatic women who are at increased risk for 
osteoporosis, who lack known contraindications, and who 
have received adequate counseling about potential benefits 
and risks (see Clinical Intervention). The role of exercise 
and dietary calcium supplementation in preventing 
osteoporosis is discussed in Chapters 49 and 50; see 
Chapter 40 regarding screening for low bone mineral 
content. 

Burden of Suffering
 
It is estimated that 1.3 million osteoporosis-related 
fractures occur each year in the United States.1 Most of 
these injuries occur in postmenopausal women. It has been 
estimated that about one-quarter of all women over age 60 
have spinal compression fractures and about 15% of women 
sustain hip fractures during their lifetime.2,3 Hip 
fractures are associated with significant pain and 
disability, decreased functional independence, and high 
mortality. There is a 15-20% reduction in expected survival 
in the first year following a hip fracture.4 Hip fractures 
cost the United States over $7 billion each year in direct 
and indirect costs.5 Important risk factors for 
osteoporosis include advanced age, female sex, Caucasian or 
Asian race, slender build, bilateral oophorectomy prior to 
natural menopause, smoking, and alcohol abuse.
 
Efficacy of Chemoprophylaxis
 
There is good evidence from retrospective studies6-9 and 
clinical trials10-17 that estrogen replacement can reduce 
the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women. Although it 
is likely that this physiological effect on bone mineral 
content can reduce the incidence of fractures and other 
clinical measures of osteoporosis, prospective evidence 
linking estrogen to fracture rates has been difficult to 
obtain because of the long interval between the onset of 
osteoporosis and the occurrence of symptoms. There is, 
however, a large body of evidence from retrospective 
studies,6,8,9,18 cross-sectional studies,19 cohort studies, 
and nonrandomized clinical trials20,21 that estrogen 
replacement is associated with a decreased rate of 
fractures. These findings do not provide conclusive 
evidence of efficacy, due to the potential influence of 
selection bias, recall bias, and confounding in many of 
these studies. It may be impractical, however, to carry out 
randomized controlled trials of sufficient duration to 
provide definitive evidence that estrogen replacement can 
lower fracture rates.
 
The use of estrogen to prevent osteoporosis can also have 
other benefits. Estrogen can reduce the incidence of 
vasomotor flushes and vaginal atrophy. Perhaps the most 
important benefit of estrogen, however, is its ability to 
improve lipoprotein profiles; many studies in recent years 
have demonstrated an association between the use of 
estrogen and reduced mortality from coronary artery 
disease.22-28 At the same time, there are potentially 
important side effects associated with long-term use of 
unopposed estrogen. Prolonged use of unopposed, conjugated 
estrogens increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and 
endometrial cancer.29-33 Although these tumors are usually 
early-stage and minimally invasive at diagnosis, an 
increased risk of disseminated endometrial cancer has been 
documented.29,30 Combining estrogen with cycled progestins 
may reduce the risk of cancer,34 but conclusive evidence of 
an effect on endometrial cancer mortality is lacking.35 In 
addition, some women may dislike the menstrual bleeding 
produced by progestins and discontinue use of the drug. 
There is inconsistent evidence regarding the reported 
association between estrogen therapy and such diseases as 
breast cancer and gallbladder disease.35-40
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
Few studies have examined the effectiveness of physician 
counseling to use estrogen. There is evidence, however, 
that compliance with estrogen therapy is generally poor 
among postmenopausal women, in part because of the 
perceived risk of developing cancer and unpleasant side 
effects. One author, citing personal communications from 
the investigators, reported that 20-30% of women in the 
Massachusetts Women's Health Survey never had their 
prescriptions filled because they were not convinced of the 
benefits and safety of therapy; of those who began therapy, 
20% discontinued the drug within nine months.41 Compliance 
with estrogen replacement is often limited by the 
inconvenience associated with daily administration. The 
availability of transdermal estrogen and new dosage 
regimens may offer potential means of reducing 
inconvenience, but the effectiveness of alternative routes 
of administration in enhancing long-term compliance has yet 
to be proved.41
 
Recommendations of Others
 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
recommends consideration of estrogen therapy in all 
hypoestrogenic (including postmenopausal) women.42 A 1984 
National Institutes of Health consensus development 
conference recommended that estrogen therapy after 
menopause should be considered in high-risk women who have 
no medical contraindications and who are willing to adhere 
to a program of careful follow-up.1 The Canadian Task Force 
advises against widespread use of estrogen to prevent 
osteoporosis, but recommends offering therapy to women who 
appear to be at increased risk on an individual basis.43
 
Discussion
 
Although there is good evidence that estrogen therapy can 
reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women, there is 
insufficient evidence to recommend its routine 
prescription. Definitive evidence that estrogen replacement 
therapy can prevent bone fractures or other clinical 
measures of osteoporosis requires a lengthy randomized 
controlled trial that may be difficult to perform in the 
future for logistical reasons. In the absence of such 
evidence, it is difficult to determine with certainty 
whether the benefits of estrogen replacement (e.g., 
preservation of bone mass, improved lipoprotein profiles 
and cardiovascular mortality reduction, reduced menopausal 
symptoms) outweigh its potential risks (e.g., endometrial 
cancer) and inconvenience (e.g., vaginal bleeding, daily 
administration) in all postmenopausal women. In some 
asymptomatic women, however, such as those at increased 
risk and those with early indications of low peak bone mass 
(see Chapter 40), the benefit-risk ratio is likely to be 
more favorable. It is especially important for such women 
to receive counseling about potential benefits and risks so 
that they can make an informed decision about therapy. The 
perimenopausal period is an important time for such 
decisions; the evidence is less clear regarding the 
benefits of beginning estrogen treatment at older ages.44
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Although estrogen replacement is not recommended for all 
postmenopausal women, estrogen therapy should be considered 
in asymptomatic women who are at increased risk for 
osteoporosis (e.g., Caucasian or Asian women, women with 
low bone mineral content, those with a slender build, and 
those with a history of early menopause or bilateral 
oophorectomy prior to menopause) and who are without known 
contraindications (e.g., history of undiagnosed vaginal 
bleeding, active liver disease, thromboembolic disorders, 
or hormone-dependent cancer). These patients should receive 
information on the risks and consequences of osteoporotic 
fractures and the risks and benefits of hormonal therapy. 
All women should receive information about potential 
alternatives for osteoporosis prevention such as 
weight-bearing exercise (see Chapter 49) and dietary 
calcium supplementation (see Chapter 50). Women consenting 
to estrogen therapy should be counseled about the various 
estrogen and progestin preparations and routes of 
administration that are available. One common regimen is 
0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen on days 1-25 (or daily) 
with the addition of 5-10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate 
during the last 12 days of the cycle. Dosages should be 
modified to reduce side effects such as nausea, headache, 
breakthrough bleeding, weight gain, and breast tenderness.

<BODY><H1>Aspirin Prophylaxis</H1>
<PRE>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Recommendation:
 
Low-dose aspirin therapy should be considered for men aged 
40 and over who are at significantly increased risk for 
myocardial infarction and who lack contraindications to the 
drug (see Clinical Intervention). Patients should 
understand the potential benefits and risks of aspirin 
therapy before beginning treatment.
 
Burden of Suffering
 
Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in 
the United States, accounting for about 1.5 million 
myocardial infarctions and over 520,000 deaths each 
year.1,2 About 400,000 Americans are victims of sudden 
death each year, due primarily to underlying 
atherosclerotic disease. Myocardial infarction is 
associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and 
disability. The cost to the United States of medical care 
and lost productivity due to cardiovascular diseases was 
nearly $80 billion in 1986.2 Myocardial infarction and 
sudden death often occur without warning in persons without 
a history of angina pectoris or other clinical symptoms. 
The principal risk factors for coronary artery disease are 
smoking, hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol, obesity, 
and family history.
 
Efficacy of Chemoprophylaxis
 
The platelet-inhibitory effect of aspirin prevents the 
formation of arterial thrombi on atherosclerotic plaques.3 
A number of secondary prevention trials have shown that 
daily aspirin ingestion can lower the risk of nonfatal 
strokes and myocardial infarctions (MI) in persons at 
increased risk for atherosclerosis and thrombogenesis 
(persons with unstable angina, previous MI, transient 
ischemic attacks, and post4,5 Few studies, however, have 
examined the efficacy of using aspirin as a primary 
prevention tool in asymptomatic persons without such a 
history, who are thus at much lower risk of developing 
myocardial infarctions. The use of aspirin in preventing 
stroke in persons without neurologic symptoms has been 
proposed for persons at risk for thromboembolic events 
(e.g., those with carotid bruits, valvular heart disease, 
atrial fibrillation),6 but convincing data to support its 
efficacy even in these populations is lacking.
 
Two recent randomized controlled trials, in the United 
States and Britain, have examined the efficacy of aspirin 
in preventing myocardial infarction in healthy men. In the 
American trial, over 22,000 asymptomatic male physicians 
received either 325 mg of aspirin every other day or 
placebo.7 The study was terminated prematurely after 4.5 
years when a statistically significant 47% reduction in the 
incidence of fatal and nonfatal MI was noted in the group 
receiving aspirin. The British trial, with a smaller sample 
size (5139 male physicians) and a higher dose (500 mg 
daily), found no significant reduction in MI.8 Although the 
absence of an apparent reduction in MI may have been due to 
lack of efficacy, the British trial may have failed to 
demonstrate a significant effect on MI due to its 
inadequate sample size and other differences in study 
design (e.g., higher dose, no placebo).9 Neither study had 
sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a reduction in 
overall cardiovascular mortality.9 Both trials observed an 
increase in the incidence of stroke among persons taking 
aspirin, but in neither study was the difference 
statistically significant.7,8 In the preliminary results of 
the American trial, a statistically significant increase in 
the incidence of moderate and severe hemorrhagic strokes 
was reported among men taking aspirin.7 In a more recent 
analysis of the final data, however, the investigators 
determined that this difference was not statistically 
significant.10
 
Other side effects of aspirin therapy must also be 
considered in evaluating its long-term safety. Aspirin can 
produce unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms such as 
stomach pain, heartburn, nausea and constipation, as well 
as occult gastrointestinal blood loss, hematemesis, and 
melena.5 The likelihood of such side effects in otherwise 
healthy persons is directly related to the dose of the 
drug. In the British trial, in which the dose was 500 mg 
daily, 20% of the doctors taking aspirin had to discontinue 
the drug due to dyspepsia and constipation, 3.6% 
experienced bleeding or bruising, and 2.2% had 
gastrointestinal blood loss.8 In the American trial, in 
which the dose was 325 mg every other day, there was less 
than a 1% difference in gastrointestinal complaints between 
the aspirin and placebo groups, and only one case of fatal 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage was reported in 4.5 years of 
treatment.7,10 Similarly, a large secondary prevention 
trial also reported little difference in epigastric 
discomfort, decreased hemoglobin concentration, or occult 
blood in stool in persons receiving 324 mg per day.11
 
In addition to reducing the risk of side effects, low-dose 
therapy appears to have comparable (if not greater) 
platelet-inhibitory action when compared with higher doses. 
A review of 25 secondary prevention trials with a total of 
29,000 patients found little difference in outcome in 
dosages ranging from 300 to 1200 mg per day.4 In one study, 
a dose of only 60 mg daily was effective in reducing the 
incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension.12 It is 
possible that high-dose therapy may even have less 
platelet-inhibitory effect, by inhibiting vessel wall 
synthesis of prostacyclin along with platelet production of 
thromboxane A2. Doses as low as 30-40 mg daily may be 
necessary to achieve an optimal balance.13 The probability 
of adverse effects at such low doses is likely to be small, 
but further studies of aspirin therapy are needed to 
provide definitive evidence regarding both the clinical 
efficacy of low-dose regimens and the safety of long-term 
administration.
 
Effectiveness of Counseling
 
There is little information on whether asymptomatic 
patients will comply with physician advice to take aspirin 
for an extended period of time. Aspirin is the most 
consumed drug in the United States, with an estimated 20-30 
billion tablets ingested each year,5 but most users are 
suffering from pain, fever, or other forms of discomfort 
when they choose to use the drug. It is not known whether 
healthy individuals would be able or willing to comply with 
a lifelong daily (or alternate day) regimen, especially if 
it produces unpleasant side effects. As noted above, over 
the course of six years, 20% of the doctors participating 
in the British trial were forced to discontinue a daily 500 
mg aspirin regimen because of dyspepsia and constipation.8
 
Recommendations of Others
  The American Heart Association has recently advised 
physicians to exercise care before starting a patient on 
lifelong aspirin therapy; efforts should first be directed 
at modifying primary risk factors for heart disease and 
stroke, assessing potential contraindications to aspirin, 
and counseling patients about potential side effects and 
symptoms requiring medical attention.14 Investigators in 
the U.S. and British trials have recommended that 
physicians prescribing aspirin to asymptomatic persons 
first consider the cardiovascular risk profile of the 
patient and balance the known hazards of aspirin (e.g., 
gastrointestinal discomfort and bleeding, cerebral 
hemorrhage) against the benefit of reducing the risk of a 
first myocardial infarction.9
 
Discussion
 
Although data from a large trial have provided evidence 
that low-dose aspirin therapy can reduce the risk of 
myocardial infarction in asymptomatic men,7 it is premature 
to recommend routine use of aspirin for this purpose in the 
general population. These benefits were demonstrated in a 
select population: male doctors between the ages of 40 and 
84 in exceptionally good health, who were then prescreened 
to eliminate persons unable to tolerate aspirin. In 
addition, the study was terminated prematurely; therefore, 
it is not known with certainty whether the long-term 
complications of aspirin therapy might have ultimately 
exceeded its benefits.15 Some patients might judge the 
reduced risk of MI inadequate to justify the unpleasant 
side effects or increased risk of gastrointestinal 
bleeding. Moreover, in both the U.S. and British studies, 
strokes may have been more common in men taking aspirin. 
Although the differences were not statistically 
significant, the consistency of the findings suggests that 
further study of the relationship between aspirin therapy 
and cerebral hemorrhage is warranted. Hypertensives, a 
population at increased risk for both coronary artery and 
cerebrovascular disease, may be more likely to experience 
hemorrhagic stroke while taking this drug.5,16
 
Clinical Intervention
 
Low-dose aspirin therapy (325 mg every other day) should be 
considered for primary prevention in men aged 40 and over 
who have risk factors for myocardial infarction (e.g., 
hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, family 
history of early-onset coronary artery disease) and who 
lack a history of uncontrolled hypertension, liver or 
kidney disease, peptic ulcer disease, a history of 
gastrointestinal or other bleeding problems, or other risk 
factors for bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage. Patients 
should understand the potential benefits and risks 
associated with aspirin therapy before beginning treatment, 
and they should be encouraged to focus their efforts on 
modifying primary risk factors such as smoking (see Chapter 
48), elevated cholesterol (Chapters 2 and 50), and 
hypertension (Chapter 3).

<HR>

</FONT></H1></EM>Art Anderson Associates is a multi discipline architecture and engineering firm 
with offices in both downtown Bremerton and Seattle in Washington State.  
The firm was established in 1957 to provide marine engineering and naval 
architecture services.  After more than two decades of successfully 
completing numerous U.S. Navy and commercial marine contracts, Art
 
<IMG SRC="commonim/vic8.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN=left WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=215>

Anderson Associates started what is today our Architecture/Engineering (A/E) Division 
with Architecture, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical and 
Electrical Engineering, and Construction Management areas of expertise.  
Our Marine Division continues to be a leader in providing designs for 
ocean going ships and small vessels to government and commercial clients.  
Between the two divisions, we currently staff over 70 employees.<BR><P>
Art Anderson Associates also has specialized capabilities in Value 
Engineering for both shore and maritime projects.  Key employees 
have completed training in value engineering theory and have participated 
in value engineering studies, which have saved our clients millions of dollars. 

<IMG SRC="commonim/pusherm3.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN="right" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=161><P>

Because of our multi discipline capabilities the firm is unique in its 
ability to provide comprehensive and cost effective solutions.  We take 
pride in our management methods that ensure integrated designs which 
minimize problems during construction.  We have found that the majority 
of conflicts in the construction phase result from designs in which the 
architecture and engineering disciplines are not well coordinated.  Art 
Anderson Associates has all the major disciplines under one roof.  
Additionally, we use our copyrighted "Multi-Check" process for constructibility reviews 
and design quality control, which focuses 
on interdisciplinary coordination issues.  Using this process we have 
reduced our change order rate for new construction as a percentage of 
construction cost to less than one half of one percent, well below the 4.2% 
industry average.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="commonim/fed3.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN="left" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=166>

Art Anderson Associates maintains a pro-active stance on every project, 
anticipating the needs of both project and client.  We have the depth 
and flexibility to rally whatever resources are necessary.  We communicate 
openly and constantly with all members of the project team including the 
client and the regulatory agencies involved.  Art Anderson  Associates 
capitalizes on feedback and lessons learned by cycling this information 
back into our processes.<P>
Our second-generation, family-owned company is well known for its 
commitment to quality, excellence and customer satisfaction.  The 
architects and engineers at Art Anderson Associates have been publicly 
recognized through awards and published projects for design excellence, 
teamwork, responsiveness, professionalism, technical expertise and 
commitment.  Art Anderson Associates' dedication to its community and 
the people within have earned us recognition by CEO Magazine as one of 
the best companies to work for in Washington State for the third 
consecutive year.<BR><BR><HR><BR>

<HR>

</FONT></H1></EM>Art Anderson Associates is a multi discipline architecture and engineering firm 
with offices in both downtown Bremerton and Seattle in Washington State.  
The firm was established in 1957 to provide marine engineering and naval 
architecture services.  After more than two decades of successfully 
completing numerous U.S. Navy and commercial marine contracts, Art
 
<IMG SRC="commonim/vic8.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN=left WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=215>

Anderson Associates started what is today our Architecture/Engineering (A/E) Division 
with Architecture, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical and 
Electrical Engineering, and Construction Management areas of expertise.  
Our Marine Division continues to be a leader in providing designs for 
ocean going ships and small vessels to government and commercial clients.  
Between the two divisions, we currently staff over 70 employees.<BR><P>
Art Anderson Associates also has specialized capabilities in Value 
Engineering for both shore and maritime projects.  Key employees 
have completed training in value engineering theory and have participated 
in value engineering studies, which have saved our clients millions of dollars. 

<IMG SRC="commonim/pusherm3.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN="right" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=161><P>

Because of our multi discipline capabilities the firm is unique in its 
ability to provide comprehensive and cost effective solutions.  We take 
pride in our management methods that ensure integrated designs which 
minimize problems during construction.  We have found that the majority 
of conflicts in the construction phase result from designs in which the 
architecture and engineering disciplines are not well coordinated.  Art 
Anderson Associates has all the major disciplines under one roof.  
Additionally, we use our copyrighted "Multi-Check" process for constructibility reviews 
and design quality control, which focuses 
on interdisciplinary coordination issues.  Using this process we have 
reduced our change order rate for new construction as a percentage of 
construction cost to less than one half of one percent, well below the 4.2% 
industry average.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="commonim/fed3.jpg" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=20 ALIGN="left" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=166>

Art Anderson Associates maintains a pro-active stance on every project, 
anticipating the needs of both project and client.  We have the depth 
and flexibility to rally whatever resources are necessary.  We communicate 
openly and constantly with all members of the project team including the 
client and the regulatory agencies involved.  Art Anderson  Associates 
capitalizes on feedback and lessons learned by cycling this information 
back into our processes.<P>
Our second-generation, family-owned company is well known for its 
commitment to quality, excellence and customer satisfaction.  The 
architects and engineers at Art Anderson Associates have been publicly 
recognized through awards and published projects for design excellence, 
teamwork, responsiveness, professionalism, technical expertise and 
commitment.  Art Anderson Associates' dedication to its community and 
the people within have earned us recognition by CEO Magazine as one of 
the best companies to work for in Washington State for the third 
consecutive year.<BR><BR><HR><BR>

<P>The new 25,000-sf, 3-story facility for the City of Port Orchard is located 
on the same block as the former city hall, and is slated for occupancy in 
1997.  The project provides larger office space for the Mayor, City Clerk,
Community Development, Treasurer, Municipal Court and Police departments.   
The steel frame structure has two entrances; one for the public from the upper 
street level consisting of a 2-story atrium, and a lower level entrance for 
police department operations.</P><BR>

The building exterior is detailed with traditional massings and materials 
to integrate into the adjacent residential neighborhood.  The building 
is situated at the north end of the site to take advantage of mountain and 
water views, and to allow the existing city hall to remain in operation.  
The site has a parking area for staff and police, and a parking area for 
the public. <BR><BR>

<H2>About the Author</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Chris McKesson is Principal in charge of Naval Architecture
at Art Anderson Associates, in Bremerton Washington.  He has a
long-standing interest and involvement in the field of advanced
marine vehicles.  In 1990 he was Head of Advanced Vehicle Design
for the US Navy (NAVSEA).  He has represented the United States
as technical expert to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).  He has represented the state-of-the-art in ship design
to staff of the United States Congress. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In 1989 McKesson was attached to the government
of France as part of a US Navy engineer exchange program. While
in France he was in charge of two French Navy advanced vehicle
design projects. He was also &quot;double-hatted&quot; as a member
of the Consulate's Office of Defense Cooperation.  In this capacity
McKesson maintained liaison between the French naval design staff
and the US naval design staff in Washington. Amongst his current
clients may be found such diverse entities as the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, the Washington State Ferry System,
Gentry TransAtlantic Inc., and Honolulu Shipyards.<BR><BR>

<H2><U>Introduction &amp; Background         </U></H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1989 Mr. Tom Gentry set the transatlantic speed
record with the V-bottom mono hull <I>Gentry Eagle.</I>  Then in
1992 the record fell to the Italian <I>Destriero.</I>  Like the
competitor that he is Gentry took <I>Destriero</I>'s success as
a direct personal challenge and set out to retake the record.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tom Gentry and Project Manager John Connor established
Gentry Transatlantic Inc. in Fort Lauderdale Florida, for the
express purpose of developing a new high speed boat.  The project
team studied several hull forms before encountering Washington
Naval Architect Chris McKesson.  McKesson convinced the group
to model test a large SES designed for an un refueled record-breaking
crossing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The model tests were successful, and McKesson's concept
became the starting point for the Transatlantic development program.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Fort Lauderdale based team have decades of high
speed boating experience.  The team members have an incredible
number of hours of on-the-water experience at speeds over 100
MPH.  Connor is typical of the team members, being himself a six-time
world champion powerboat racer.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This team brought to the table technology developed
in the world of powerboat racing.  McKesson brought to the table
a world of SES development work dating back to the USN 3KSES program.
 The result was a marriage of two communities, and a very interesting
new boat design.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Transatlantic team applied their lessons learned
to McKesson's basic concept.  They also engaged M. J. Plackett
&amp; Associates of Corvallis OR. to develop an improved lift
and skirt system.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this paper I wish to present an overview of the
boat and the project.  I will follow a chronological approach,
stepping through the evolution of the program.  It is my belief
that this project is equally interesting from the viewpoint of
the unique relationships and coincidences that took place, as
well as from a purely technical viewpoint.  I shall attempt to
address both of these viewpoints in the pages that follow.</FONT>
<H2>First Discussion - Presentation of the concept</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The marine industry is well known to be a small,
close knit community.  And yet within this community there exist
intriguing sub communities, who may be unaware of one another's
existence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, in 1992, the communities of &quot;high-speed
boat racing&quot; and &quot;advanced naval vehicles&quot; had
little contact.  At this time I was under contract to Textron
Lycoming to provide technical support to their sales of the TF-40
gas turbine.  My client Mr. Les Gingell and I embarked on a tour
of the Patrol Craft industry as part of this contract.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Our intended route was a two day stop in the Miami
area, followed by a visit to the New Orleans / Gulfport axis.
 We watched with a certain dismay as another traveler followed
our exact route, one day ahead of us: Hurricane Andrew.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hurricane Andrew tore through South Florida.  Our
hotel was closed to us, since there was a foot of standing water
in the lobby.  One prospect was unable to receive our visit, since
the rooftop of his manufacturing facility was lying in the parking
lot.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We eventually made our way to the offices of Gentry
TransAtlantic.  The <I>Gentry</I> <I>Eagle</I>  <I> </I>had a
single Lycoming TF-40 in it, which made them a legitimate visit,
and we knew that John Connor was a pleasant fellow to spend some
time with.  We spent an intriguing several hours moving one of
John's friends out of a sinking houseboat before the water level
rose to the height of the furniture.  Our repayment was to be
invited to the one bar in town that still had refrigeration, and
thus cold drinks.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I dwell on this travelogue just to emphasize how
big a role is played by happenstance.  I do not believe that this
is unique to the present project, but is in fact a major factor
in most business affairs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Over beer and oysters the discussion naturally turned
to the trans-Atlantic target.  John asked what hull form I would
use to break the record.  I immediately suggested an SES.  On
a cocktail napkin I explained the SES concept.  I like to keep
in my head a collection of simplified equations for craft performance
[Ref 1].  Cocktail napkin calculations using these formulas showed
that a SES could easily do the job.  After all, wasn't the 3K
SES feasible, and wouldn't it have clearly been a record breaker?
 The only real question was how much smaller than 3,000 tons could
one be to still be a record breaker.</FONT>
<H2>First Negotiations with the Client:  Why an SES? </H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Our cocktail napkin discussion caught John's interest.
 He had, up to this point, tested many interesting variations
on the planing hull.  These included planing trimarans, reverse-three-point
forms, and other exotic planing-hull concepts.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The result of these tests were that all concepts
needed a 10%  boost.  In John's expression what he needed was
&quot;lightweight fuel&quot;.  He and his team had even followed
this thought path to the point of investigating the feasibility
of hydrogen-fueling a vessel.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By contrast the SES appeared to offer a 20% improvement,
easily surpassing the existing record.  This realization became
a keystone in the subsequent feasibility design phase.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the consequences
result from 20% of the causes.  In our case the critical breakthrough
was the use of an SES hull form.  This resulted in 80% of our
success.  Most of the other subsequent decisions (L/B ratio, choice
of propulsor, etc.) would be shown to be on 20% important.   </FONT>
<H2>Baseline Design</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The cocktail napkin conversation was sufficiently
convincing that the Gentry team contracted for a concept design.
 We were still not full partners:  Gentry TransAtlantic contracted
for a feasibility from which they would build a model.  Model
tests would be conducted by Gentry TransAtlantic to establish
our credibility.  If we passed this test then we might expect
to enter into a more collaborative relationship with the owner.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This approach clearly established our guiding principle:
 Be right.  In 1993 we (Art Anderson Associates) were  funded
to develop a concept design.  The resulting vessel is depicted
in <A HREF="f2.gif">Figure 2</A> and <A HREF="f3.gif">Figure 3</A></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of this design followed a set of
design guidelines selected according to the 80/20 rule mentioned
above:  We believe that the SES concept is the critical variable
for success.  In the other areas, propulsion system for example,
we avoided innovation.  &quot;Innovate where it's necessary, be
low risk where it's not.&quot;  Our goal was to be undeniably
correct and conservative in the test phase, while still maintaining
high enough performance break the record.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In practical terms this  meant that we simply used
two-thirds of <I>Destriero</I>'s propulsion plant:  A pair of
LM-1600's coupled to KaMeWa waterjets.  After all this was a proven
non-developmental system.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly the geometries selected were simple.  Systems
design followed a principle of <I>reductio ad absurdium</I>. 
In a similar approach we used DNV rules for structural design,
rather than proposing a structural loads R&amp;D program.  Remember
throughout this that we were designing a vessel for one 48 hour
trip.  We were not designing a commercial craft with a 20 year
economic life, nor a warship intended to sail into harm's way.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There was one unique constraint imposed by the client:
 Beam.  For an 80 knot service speed pure hydrodynamic consideration
would drive an SES to an L:B ratio of about 2:1.  In order to
moor in a yacht harbor, a Mega-Yacht should have a beam not over
40 feet.  We performed a parametric design study to look at the
interrelationship of Length, Beam, Displacement, and Required
power.  The results of this parametric study are shown in <A HREF="f4.gif">Figure
4</A>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As may be seen, increasing the beam would reduce
the total required power.  However the penalty was not tremendous,
and the selected design was 145-feet to 165-feet with a 40-foot
beam.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ship is summarized in <A HREF="table1.html">Table 1</A>

<H2>First  Model Tests</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The TransAtlantic team have their own model construction
and testing facility in Fort Lauderdale Florida.  The facility
is not a towing tank, but rather an innovative use of the south
Florida canals.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The model is towed alongside a tow boat.  The tow
boat for our tests was a 20-foot tunnel-hull boat designed and
built by Mr. Connor.  The tow boat is propelled by a 250 hp Mercury
Black Max outboard.  Without a tow attached the tow boat will
exceed 50 mph.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An outrigger boom extends to the side of the towboat.
 The model is towed from the end of this boom.  The tow tether
is attached via a strain gage, which is calibrated to read pounds
of drag directly.  The tow gage is recalibrated at the start of
each day's testing to ensure that the calibration doesn't &quot;drift.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tow speed is measured by various speedometers on
the tow boat, including a handheld GPS.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unlike a planing hull the SES requires that power
be carried out to the model (the model fans were electrically
powered.)  A second outrigger was installed on the tow boat which
dropped an electrical umbilical on top of the model.  The umbilical
descended vertically to ensure that it did not contribute to tow
force or drag.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A view of the tow rig is given in 
Figure 5.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="f7.gif" ALT="Figure 7"ALIGN=left WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=154 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I was concerned that the team tow the model from
the model's center of gravity.  Visible in Figures 6 &amp; 7 is
an aluminum frame which attaches to the model on a pivot joint
acting through the CG.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This first model was successfully tested over a period
of many months.  Eventually the model was destroyed by continued
use.  Figure 8 is typical of the many photographs of the model
underway.  Model test results were excellent.  Total propulsive
power required (shaft horsepower - SHP) was 27,000 hp at 76 knots
at full load displacement.</FONT>
<IMG SRC="f8.gif" ALT="Figure 8" ALIGN=right WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=105 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The biggest lessons learned during the first phase
of model testing were three:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We encountered significant bow plunging problems
at scaled speeds above 65 knots.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We proved the importance of fitting spray rails
both inside the cushion and outside.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We convinced the client that the SES truly offered
the performance claimed.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Model test series one was begun with the intent of
seeing, on the part of a skeptical client, whether the SES concept
really had the performance potential we claimed.  We developed
a conservative feasibility design with a 65knot speed target.
 We overwhelmingly succeeded in making our case, and the project
entered an exciting second phase</FONT>
<H2>Design Improvements - Second Design</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We now entered a stage where full collaboration took
place between Art Anderson Associates and the TransAtlantic team.
 During this phase the TransAtlantic engineers added their unique
high-speed boat skills to the SES design.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This collaboration made several design improvements
which were incorporated into the second boat.  We will briefly
summarize these improvements.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Increased Sidehull Beam</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 While the design sea state was quite modest, rough sea performance
was of interest to the owner.  Based on the team's tunnel boat
design experience an increased beam sidehull was developed.  A
longitudinal strake was employed with the result that in calm
water the sidehull beam is as narrow as the baseline.  Only in
extreme motions or seas does the increased beam come into play.
 This increased beam results in much greater sidehull planing
forces and has yielded a very benignly behaved craft.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Reduced Wetted Surface Sidehulls</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 Sidehull friction dominates the drag of the craft when at high
speed.  This characteristic is shared by other very fast craft
such as offshore powerboats.  It is common in &quot;super boat&quot;
design to incorporate means of speed-dependently reducing the
wetted surface of the hull.  This was incorporated into model
No.2 and was found to contribute a net 10% reduction in sidehull
drag.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Pickle Fork Bow</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  The baseline
narrow-sidehull design showed a bow plunging problem in model
tests.  The team, again drawing on race boat experience, developed
<IMG SRC="f13.gif" ALT="Figure 13" ALIGN=left WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=124 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
a pickle fork bow which resulted in increased pitch restoring
force and completely eliminated the undesired behavior.  Figure
13 shows Model No. 2 and depicts these three enhancements.  Figure
14 shows the model under way. Drag extrapolations to full scale
show that this model had 25% less drag than Model #1..</FONT>
<IMG SRC="f14.gif" ALT="Figure 14" ALIGN=right WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=113 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
<P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><B><FONT SIZE=2>Change of Propulsor</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  The
baseline design used waterjet propulsion.  The TransAtlantic team
has years of experience with surface piercing propellers.  The
original Gentry Eagle is fitted with a surface piercing propeller
and two waterjets, and they much prefer the propeller.   Much
of the research above is devoted to increasing the amount of air
under the sidehulls, allow the cushion to leak and reduce friction
by air-lubricating the sidehulls.  This device, however, is incompatible
with waterjet propulsion, as the air sheet would be ingested into
the waterjet and cause thrust breakdown.  Given this, and the
team's preference for propellers, the design switched to a surface
propeller baseline.  The problem would be to fabricate a surface
drive capable of handling the proposed 20,000 hp per side.</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="f15.gif" ALT="Figure 15" ALIGN=left WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=188 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
<FONT SIZE=2>At the same time the team purchased seven 7,000 horsepower
turbine engines at a &quot;can't pass them by&quot; price (Figure
15.)  This quickly nudged us in the direction of a four-shaft
design, with one turbine coupled to each propeller.  We found
that the propeller performance in this speed regime was compatible
with off-the-shelf surface drives.  All of a sudden the propeller
driven approach seemed feasible.  The remaining hurdle was propeller
placement.</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="f17.gif" ALT="Figure 17" ALIGN=right WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=167 HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drawing again on race boat experience the team selected
an overlapping propeller arrangement.  This is depicted in 
<A HREF="f16.gif">Figure
16</A>.  The model tests (see Figure 17) confirm the adequacy of the
propeller inflow.  We have not yet tested the performance of the
overlapping props. This is an area of ongoing research.</FONT>
<P>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=2>Adjustable Skirts</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  The
team was concerned over predicted skirt wear during the trans-Atlantic
run.  Some predictions were as high as 48 inches of bow skirt
wear during the crossing.  In order to ensure that the skirt length
would not be thus compromised during the run, MJPlackett &amp;
Associates developed an adjustable skirt system.  The system would
allow the skirts to be readjusted at various points during the
crossing, so that finger tips would be consistently near the baseline.
 In addition the team built a flagellation test rig and qualified
various seal materials for the craft.</FONT>
<H2>The Future:  What lies ahead for this project?</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In November of 1994 Tom Gentry was rendered unconscious
in a boating accident.  Once again, happenstance took over the
project's driver's seat.  Tom has been comatose since the accident.
 His trustees have terminated funding to the project and have
relinquished all the assets of Gentry TransAtlantic to Mr. John
Connor.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The project is officially for sale.  The team has
made a few attempts to promote it and has gathered some interest.
 Will the boat ever be built?  I don't know.  I am confident however
that we have learned several important things:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>There is a tremendous body of knowledge in the
race boat community.  This knowledge is not held by the advanced
vehicle community.  There is at least an equal amount of knowledge
held by the advanced vehicle community and not shared in the race
boat community.  Collaboration between these two communities can
be very fruitful. </FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We believe we have made several significant improvements
in the basic SES concept, particularly for very-high-speed applications.
 The combination of sidehull innovations in particular offer important
advances over current SES designs.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We are convinced that the SES represents the
&quot;paradigm shift&quot; that will be necessary to eclipse <I>Destriero</I>'s
record.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>The team is seeking the participation of an additional, knowledgeable partner to 
complete the construction, be a part of the speed run, and market the technology gained.

<B>General Description:</B>

<P>Art Anderson Associates is pleased to present our latest high speed 
patrol boat design, suitable for fire and police departments alike.  
The fire fighting system consists of (2) two monitors and (2) outlets 
in the aft deck.  The monitor on the pilot house top is capable of 
delivering a 4 inch stream of water 3,000 gallons per minute and it is 
operable from within the pilot house.  The 2 1/2" monitor at the bow is 
portable and can be operated at the aft outlet in the step at the aft 
deck.  The vessel has (2) 600 HP propulsion engines and (1) fire engine. 
The propulsion engines and fire fighting engines are identical and 
interchangeable.  The vessel is designed with a flush cockpit hatch over 
the entire machinery space to facilitate maintainability of the engines. 
The aft deck is suitable for rescue operations with the deck only 12 inches 
above the water and a 6 foot wide transom door.  The vessel is designed 
for heavy duty pulling and pushing with push knees at the bow, rub rails 
all around, a 10,000 pound safe working load two bitt and a 1,000 pound 
removable A-frame davit over the transom.</P>

<P>AAA has completed the contract package and it is available 
for interested parties.</P><HR><BR>

<B>General Description:</B>

<P>This water taxi design responds to opportunities in several US cities.  
The vessel can be developed in either "Taxi" or "Charter" configuration 
(shown in the figures above), including optional serving bar, DJ station, 
dance floor, etc.  The vessel styling has attempted to provide a "character" 
look, suitable for many US waterfront revitalization projects.  The full 
width deck house provides a dry, air conditioned environment for guests.</P>

<P>With a 25 knot cruising speed, the vessel could be part of a downtown 
transportation system, serving waterfront sites within the city's business 
district during the day, and becoming a cocktail cruise tourism vessel 
at night.  Propulsion for the 25 knot version is via two 6-cylinder diesels, 
such as the Volvo TMD 112A, 365 HP each.  Hamiliton waterjets provide 
excellent thrust and maneuverability, with freedom from dangers due to 
river borne debris.  Other propulsion concepts could include twin 165 HP 
outboards for a 20 knots version.  The AAA water taxi produces a wake wash 
approximately 3 inches high at all speed.</P>

<B>General Description:</B>

<P>This river ferry is highly unusual in that the source of energy is three 
electric trolley wires strung high above the river.  Designed to replace 
an existing trolley-powered ferry crossing the Willamette River in Oregon 
(one of only five such installations in the United States), 480-Volt 
utility-generated electricity drives a pair of 75-horsepower hydraulic 
power units.  The hydraulic power is, in turn, transmitted to a pair of 
Z-drive propulsors which extend down from the overhangs port and starboard.  
The ferry is attached to a submerged guide cable which is anchored to the 
shore at both ends of the ferry crossing.</P>

<P>The new ferry will have a capacity of nine cars and 49 passengers.  
Trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles, up to 35,000 pounds gross weight, 
can also be carried.  The ferry lands at a paved ramp, similar to boat 
launch ramps, at each end of the crossing.  Vehicles and pedestrians come 
aboard over a hydraulically adjustable ramp at each end of the ferry.</P>

<TITLE>Stolkraft-Introduction</TITLE>


</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="sback.gif">

<H1>Introduction</H1><BR>

<P>
Stolkraft is a uniquely innovative hull form, patented worldwide,
with applications to high speed vessels.  Conceived of by the
late aeronautical engineer, Mr. Leo D. Stolk, and subsequently
developed and refined in Australia, the hull form has been proven
in service in many commercial vessels and pleasure craft around
the world. <BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>STOLKRAFT Vessels in Service Around the World<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Upon completion of<B> </B>six years of extensive tank testing,
full scale trials, and hull form development at the Marin Institute
of Rotterdam, renowned naval architect, Dr. Peter van Oossanen,
Director of the Institute during this period, summed up the results
thusly: 
<P>
&quot;<I><B>the Stolkraft hull is proven the most significant
advance in marine hulls of this century</B></I>&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Outstanding in its simplicity, the Stolkraft obtains its excellent
high speed performance charac-teristics, purely from the forward
motion of the craft at speed and the unique form of the hull.
<P>
Described simply as the merging of the forebody of a trimaran
with the aftbody of a catamaran, the hull form employs both hydrodynamic
planing craft principles and aerodynamics to move more efficiently
at higher speeds.  The air flow, generated by forward motion of
the vessel, is ducted through two symmetrical scoops formed by
the tri-hulled forebody.  A vacuum caused <BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>The STOLKRAFT Hull Form<BR>

<P>
by an amidships step combined with complex flow phenomena behind
the three hulls, creates a cushion of air in the aftbody recess
between the two outer hulls, significantly reducing frictional
resistance and subduing hull generated wake/wash.<BR>

<P>
As operators, in their quest for higher speeds, encounter ever
increasing vessel complexities with their associated high capital,
operating, and maintenance costs, the Stolkraft hull form offers
them a clear cut alternative possessing the following combination
of characteristics:

the potential of the Stolkraft hull form in world markets is significant.  Lately, the Stolkraft
has been attracting worldwide

<H1>Qualities of the Stolkraft Hull Form</H1><BR>


<P>
The Stolkraft hull offers operators a unique combination of outstanding
qualities unmatched by other hull forms.  These features will
be briefly reviewed in the subsequent paragraphs.<BR>




<P>
<B>LOW WAKE / WASH:  </B>At speed, Stolkraft vessels have none
of the significant bow or stern waves of conventional hull forms,
as shown in the photographs below of two Stolkrafts which vary
widely in size and displacement.  This feature makes the Stolkraft
environmentally friendly, and the ideal choice for narrow waterways,
rivers, and lakes where erosion to shorelines is a problem, or
turbulence to other nearby boaters may be a nuisance.  An example
of this are the Stolkraft waterbusses of Surfer's Paradise in
Queensland, Australia, which were granted special permission to
operate on residentially developed canals and waterways at speeds
up to 30 knots, while all other vessels were limited to just 6
knots. <BR><BR>

<P>
<B>SHALLOW DRAFT:  </B>At speed, the draft of a Stolkraft is reduced
by about 67%, while at rest or slow speeds, the top of the aftbody
recess is underwater, providing great buoyancy.  The at-rest draft
is shallow compared to conventional catamarans and deep-vee monohulls,
allowing Stolkrafts, such those operating in Surfer's Paradise
as waterbusses, to pull right up to beaches having no wharves
or landing facilities to load or off-load passengers directly.
 This capability is of interest to workboat operators and navies
worldwide in the application of the hull form to various beach
landing craft.

<P>
<B>EXCELLENT SPEED / POWER CHARACTERISTICS:  </B> After six years
of extensive tank testing at the Netherlands Ship Model Basin
(NSMB) at Wageningen in Holland, Dr. Peter Van Oossanen, head
of the Design Research Department, summarized in his report of
May 1986: &quot;the final design has a speed-power characteristic
more favourable than the high-speed catamaran, planing craft and
surface piercing hydrofoils, but less favourable than the fully-submerged
hydrofoil (such as the Boeing Jetfoil) and air-cushion vehicles&quot;.

<CENTER><B>Stolkraft Speed / Power Characteristics<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Marin (NSMB) charts on the previous page illustrate the power
requirements of a Stolkraft

in comparison with other vessel types over the high speed range
in service conditions.  These graphs demonstrate that as speed
increases, so does the performance gap between the Stolkraft and
many other high speed marine craft.  Only the capital intensive
and complex vessels can match the power/speed performance of a
Stolkraft.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>ECONOMICS OF OPERATION:  </B>Also in 1986, the Maritime Economic
Research Centre of Rotterdam compared the Stolkraft operating
costs with other high speed craft on the basis of the NSMB tests
and their extensive data banks. All craft had the same disposable
load capability.  All aspects were considered, including both
capital and running costs.  Compared to the Stolkraft, the annual
operating costs of the other types were found to be:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>10 Year Operating Costs of Various High Speed Marine
Vessels
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Stolkraft is the most economical due to its combination of
highly efficient hull form and low capital cost.  The lower fuel
costs of the more elaborate craft such as the ACV, fully submerged
hydrofoil and SES are more than offset by their high capital and
maintenance costs. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>EXCELLENT FUEL ECONOMY:  </B>The NSMB tests show that compared
with catamarans, monohulls, and surface piercing hydrofoils, operators
can realize significant reductions in fuel consumption by installing
either smaller engines for a given speed, or by obtaining more
speed for a given horsepower. 
<P>
<B>EXCELLENT SEAKEEPING<BR>
</B>
<P>
The level trim of the Stolkraft, its air cushion, and the wave-breaking
contours of its bows, give
<P>
the vessel a smooth and shock-free ride in heavy seas.  Authorities
at the David Taylor Model Basin in Carderock, Maryland, having
recently completed seakeeping tests on a model of 17 meter Stolkraft,
state that even in head seas, motions are no worse than normal
planing monohulls, and only slightly worse than deep-vee monohulls
of very high length-to-beam ratios.  In practice it has been found
that in high sea states, maintaining a track slightly away from
head sea conditions gives a very soft ride, but does not require
tacking sufficient to cause navigational problems.  In beam seas
the Stolkraft's motions are minimal and the ride is very stable.
 The vessel is a very dry craft.  In the DTMB seakeeping tests,
the model never took green seas over the bow even in the highest
waves, and at the heaviest displacements.  One of the best testimonials
to the excellent seakeeping abilities of the Stolkraft hull form
is the fact that it was chosen for the next generation of pilot
boats in Auckland, New Zealand, and in Freemantle, Australia -
operators who are traditionally conservative and sophisticated
in their choice of hull forms on which they earn their livelihoods
in often severe weather and seas.  Further evidence of the Stolkraft's
excellent seakeeping abilities can be gleaned from the quotes
of the many people who have tested and operated these remarkable
vessels:<BR>

<P>
<I>&quot;&#133; in comparison to other high speed craft which
experience a pronounced increase in wave-added resistance with
wave height such as catamarans, surface piercing hydrofoils and
air-cushion</I> <I>vehicles, the Stolkraft retains favourable
speed-power characteristics in waves.&quot;</I> Dr. Peter van
Oossanen, head of the Design Research Department, Research &amp;
Development Division of the Netherlands Ship Model Basin (MARIN).

<I>&quot;The ability of the Stolkraft to virtually 'fly' in moderately
rough conditions can only be described as confounding in my 35
years experience at sea in ships and craft of all types, sizes,
and speeds&#133;Of particular note was the capability of the craft
to compensate - virtually auto-</I>
<P>
<I>matically and as if gyro controlled - when encountering steep
waves intercepting (the hull) before the beam&#133;These (rough)
conditions did not deter the Stolkraft, which at no time took
water over the bow, nor did it falter when taking off (literally)
from one wave top to land without shock at high speed INTO the
steep face of a following swell.  Subjecting a conventional hull
to such conditions would have resulted in dangerous slamming with
associated severe panting stresses&#133;Indeed, I must advise
you that the ability of the craft to handle rough conditions exceeded
my nerve at times&#133;as to deliberately address a vessel to
rough seas at high speed is contrary to all the tenets of ship
handling&quot;  </I>Captain Ron Ware, BA, Msc, PhD<I> </I>on sea
trials he conducted with Dr. Peter van Oossanen on the <I>Mark
II</I> (5 meter) and <I>Mark III</I> (8 meter) prototypes.<BR>

<P>
<I>&quot;The most notable comments from those aboard related to
the dramatic acceleration above 30 kts and the very soft ride
in spite of running across the wake of several large ships and
the typical 'sloppy' conditions usual in areas of high traffic&#133;As
we progressed north we endured a very steep chop of around 2 meters.
 We discovered that by maintaining sufficient speed (above 30
kts) we were able to keep the bow from dropping into the troughs
and the vessel continually rode from wave peak to peak with surprising
stability&#133;We were aware of northern typhoon reports and whilst
conditions were rough we felt quite secure&#133;regardless of
wave angle the boat</I> <I>remained extremely stable and held
an even track&#133;The waves at this point we estimated at 3 meters
and rolling at us off the port bow.  The conditions were similar
throughout the afternoon, however we were able to maintain a speed
of 30 kts&#133;In summary, I must say that I was quite amazed
at the ability of this vessel to handle conditions that in any
other craft of this size would have been almost impossible let
alone maintain heading and speed&#133;Speed and the ability to
stay above waves with a stable 'ride' I found to be a most unusual
aspect of this vessel.&quot;</I>  Master Glenn Raleigh on the

<P>
<I>&quot;The result is a smooth shock-free ride which eliminates
the pounding in high speed travel over rough waters... Not only
can you cruise at speed in rough water, but you can get home fast
without complaints about the pounding.&quot;</I> John King, President

<B>EXCELLENT MANEUVERABILTY:  </B>The Stolkraft hull form, having
great separation of its propulsors with respect to its length,
is inherently highly maneuverable.  With waterjets in particular,
the vessel can sail into confined spaces such as marina slips
and maneuver out again with ease, rotate 360 degrees about its
own axis, and 'walk' literally sideways.  At full speed, the vessel,
as shown below when performing an emergency crash stop, comes
to a complete stop from full ahead in less than two boat lengths,
its trim attitude virtually unchanged, and without any significant
stern wake overtaking the vessel.

<P>
<B>OUTSTANDING STABILITY:  </B>At rest, the Stolkraft's large
waterplane area, due to the top of the aftbody recess being underwater,
affords exceptional stability.  Passengers walking about leave
the craft almost unchanged in trim and heel.  At speed, pitch
and roll motions are minimal, and in turns, heel is virtually
absent when the wheel is placed hard-over.  This significant attribute
has attracted the attention of navies worldwide to the potential
of the hull form as an unusually stable naval gun platform.  Here
is what operators have said about the remarkable stability of
the Stolkraft:<BR>

<P>
<I>&quot;For a few moments it was pretty scary as the boat accelerated
to 24 knots running along the face of a big swell.  Very soon
I felt quite comfortable and began to appreciate the immense stability
of the boat across and down the weather.&quot;</I>  R.J. Wilson,

<P>
<I>&quot;A desirable feature of a pilot vessel is steadiness in
passage to and from ships as well as steadiness alongside when
transferring pilots. 'Waitemata' excels in both.  As a landing
or disembarking platform, under all conditions 'Waitemata' far
exceeds the performance of any comparable monohull, and it is
likely that the design has no equal&#133;The longer the boat is
in operation, myself, and other members are finding out what a
safe platform she is to work from, in all weather conditions&quot;</I>

<B>EASE OF CONSTRUCTION:  </B>With NC lofting techniques, aluminum
Stolkraft hulls are no more challenging to construct than conventional
catamarans, and have been produced in fiberglass and cold-molded
wood-epoxy, in addition to aluminum.  Vessel performance is consistent
without performance degradation whether the propulsion systems
are stern drives, surface piercing propellers, V- drives, or waterjets.

<B>LARGE DECK AREAS:  </B>The Stolkraft provides generous amounts
of usable space and a high load capacity.  The beam can range
anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 the length - ratios not practical in
other conventional planing craft.  As a result, the spacious interiors,
topsides, and wheelhouses as shown below, are well suited to the
space requirements of pleasure cruisers, work boats, passenger
ferries, and patrol craft.

<P>
<B>EARLY DEVELOPMENT WORK<BR>
</B>
<P>
The concept for the unique hull form was invented by Mr. Leo D.
Stolk, an internationally recognized Australian aeronautical engineer
of Dutch descent.  The primary goals behind his concept were twofold:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>To minimize the wake/wash of high speed planing craft, and
the associated problem of erosion damage caused to shorelines.

<LI>To overcome the pitch instability of very high speed planing
craft, commonly referred to as 'porpoising'.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The hull form he invented and subsequently patented, was and still
is, unlike that of any other known vessel.  The initial hull form
was that of a modified trimaran with a transverse step amidships,
and air ducts in the outer two hulls.  The form of the bows was
meant to funnel air and roll waves beneath the hull to provide
additional lift, air lubrication, and a decrease in drag.  At
planing speeds, an appreciable ram-air effect was created solely
by the forward motion of the craft and the shape of the bows.
 This, combined with ram-air fed through twin bow air ducts and
the vacuum created behind the transverse step, created a secondary
ram-air lubricating cushion toward the rear of the craft, decreasing
frictional resistance and lifting the craft significantly.  If
through wave action, wind gust, or an increase in speed, the forebody
were to lift, aerodynamic lift forces ahead of the tranverse step
would decrease, while those  at the rear of the craft would increase,
shifting the center of pressure aft which would cause a fairly
constant trim angle to be inherently maintained - a simple, but
very effective ride-control system without the need for complex
and expensive mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic systems. 
In order to test the concept, Leo Stolk built and tested a 4.34
meter (14.25ft) fiberglass prototype, which he named <I>INCEPTOR</I>.<BR><BR>

Leo Stolk was able to confirm the soundness of his concept.  His
goals had even been exceeded.  At speed, there was a virtual absence
of wake formation, bow wash, outward hull spray, or pitch instabilities,
while seakeeping and fuel consumption characteristics were excellent.

<B>1980 TANK TESTS<BR>
</B>
<P>
In 1980, a period of extensive model testing and hull development
work was initiated which would span the next five years and cost
in the millions of dollars, beginning with tank testing at the
prestigious Netherlands Ship Model Basin (N.S.M.B.) in Wageningen.
 The tank testing was conducted under the directorship of Dr.
Peter van Oossanen, of the Research &amp; Development Department
of the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN).  Dr. van
Oossanen, one of the world's most acclaimed naval architects,
 became widely known for his collaboration with Ben Lexcen in
the development of the winged keel of <I>Australia II</I>.  In
1983 this 12 meter yacht stunningly wrested the America's Cup
from the United States for the first time in 132 years by defeating
Dennis Conner's <I>Liberty</I> in four match races to three. 
The goals of the tank tests in the first half of 1980, which utilized
a 2.44 meter long model, were three-fold:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>To determine the exact level of performance.
<LI>To determine the relative components of hydrodynamic lift
and drag.
<LI>To be able to predict with some accuracy the full scale speed/power
characteristics.

Full scale sea trials measuring speed and power were performed
in the latter half of 1980 on Pittwater Bay north of Sydney, Australia
with the 4.95 meter <I>Mark I</I> and the 8.53 meter <I>Mark II</I>
prototypes.  These were approximately two and four times as long
respectively as the 2.44 meter model tested in Wageningen.   By
this means a geosym series of the performance of three Stolkrafts
of the same basic hull form was created.  This collective data
yielded valuable insights into the various components of resistance.

<B>1981-1983 FULL SCALE TRIALS<BR>
</B>
<P>
From the testing conducted throughout 1980, it was realized that
if modifications could be made to the hull form which could effect
significant performance gains below a Fn of 4 and near the hump
speed, then favorable comparisons could be obtained with alternative
planing craft.  Through 1981,1982, and 1983, refinements to the
hull form were developed.  The original hull, as tested at Wageningen
in 1980, possessed a great number of spray chines, steps, and
planing strakes, all of which complicated construction.  The aim
of the new hull development therefor, was to improve the low speed
performance, while at the same time simplifying construction.
 Some of these recommended changes were built into a 20 foot (6.1
meter) fiberglass test craft built in Sydney.  The same tests
that had been done with the geosim series craft were performed
again on Pittwater Bay with the 20 foot craft.  These tests successfully
demonstrated a significant improvement in the lower speed performance
without significantly affecting the higher speed performance.<BR><BR>

<B>1984 TANK TESTS<BR>
</B>
<P>
In December of 1984, MARIN performed tank tests on a 3 meter model
of an 18 meter Stolkraft intended for operation on Port Philip
Bay near Melbourne, Australia, as a logistic support and personnel
vessel to support dredging operations.  Many significant changes,
some of which had been built into the 20 foot test craft, were
incorporated in this model.  These tests in calm water and in
waves included runs:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Over the full speed range.
<LI>Over a wide range of displacements.
<LI>Over a range of longitudinal center of gravity positions.
</UL>

<P>

The results of the tests, which were both promising and unsatisfactory,
are summarized below in Figure 19.<BR><BR>

<P>
Based on these results, the following recommendations were made
to improve the planing performance of the Stolkraft hull form:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Add spray strips to the hull fore and aft to stabilize the
trim behavior.
<LI>Incorporate flatter sections in the outer forebody hulls.
<LI>Straighten out warped sections in the aftbody hulls.
<LI>Flatten out the top of the air recess in the aftbody.
<LI>Incorporate a transom wedge to prevent the ventilation of
air in the recess.
</UL>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>1985 (MAY) TANK TESTS<BR>
</B>
<P>
Incorporation of the recommended changes necessitated the building
of a new model.  Subsequent testing revealed that if the air ducts
in the outer hulls were closed off, no significant decrease on
the total performance occurred.  This was confirmed almost concurrently
with the 20 foot test craft in Australia.  In waves, the open
ducts had relieved air pressure in the recess, constituting one
element of the inherent ride-control properties of the hull form,
but at the same time this had a tendency to reduce the speed-power
performance in waves.  Therefor, the air ducts were closed off
on all subsequent tests.  Calm water tests revealed an improvement
of about 15% in resistance at speeds above the hump region.

<BR><P>
Additionally, a feature which was to become of great importance
in Stolkraft research was a pronounced dip occuring in the resistance
curve near the required design speed amounting to a decrease in
resistance of about 40%.  By varying the size of the fitted transom
wedge, it was found that the position of this dip could be controlled,
and that the smaller the transom wedge was, the lower was the
speed at which the dip occurred.  It was postulated that the dip
was due to the sudden non-wetting of the top of the aftbody air
recess at a certain trim and rise of the hull.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>AUGUST 1985 TANK TESTS<BR>
</B>
<P>
To further investigate the causes for the considerable dip in
the resistance curve, the model was modified as follows, and tested
again in August of 1985.  <BR>

<UL>
<LI>The top of the aftbody air recess was raised in an attempt
to broaden the speed range over which non-wetting of the top would
occur.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The top of the aftbody air recess was made of transparent
perspex (similar to plexiglass) so as to accommodate observations
of the flow patterns in the recess.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The inner spray strips were extended.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Tests were performed to determine the most optimum transom stern
wedge configuration.

Surprisingly, it was found that fitting small transom stern wedges
to the outer hulls was better

than a wedge spanning the central recess.  These wedges resulted
in an overall decrease in

resistance over the entire speed range, and this configuration
was selected as the final one. <BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>August 1985 N.S.M.B. Tank Test Results<BR>
</B><BR></CENTER>
<P>
From the<B> </B>results of the<B> </B>August 1985 tests, it became
clear that the reduction in the wetted surface of the top of the
air recess could not by itself account for the degree to which
the resistance was decreased in the region of the dip.  Observations
of the flow in the air recess showed that complex flow phenomena
occurred between wave systems coming off each of the three forebody
hulls, and that these together with changes to the wetted surface
are the causes for the dip and the complex resistance curve which
has many humps and hollows.  <BR>

<P>
Tests performed in waves verified the acceptable performance of
the hull form.  An interesting discovery was that there is no
tendency for the resistance in waves to increase, and tests indicated
that the resistance actually tends to decrease with wave height
due to the additional lift experience by the craft, but partially
offset by the fact that the dip in the resistance curve in rough
seas becomes progressively less with increasing wave height due
to less favorable wave interaction effects and an increase in
the wetted surface area.   Overall, in comparison with other high
speed vessels which experience a very pronounced increase in wave-added
resistance with wave height such as a catamaran, SES, surface
piercing hydrofoil, or air-cushion vehicle, the Stolkraft retains
favorable speed-power characteristics in waves.

<CENTER><B> Development of the Stolkraft Hull Form From 1980 to
1985 </B></CENTER><BR>
<P>
At the conclusion of the August 1985 tests, the hull form as shown
in Figure 22 was con- sidered close to the optimum, and no further
tests were performed.  The overall results of development carried
out from 1980 to 1985 on the Stolkraft hull form were outstanding.
 As can be seen in Figure 23, hump resistance had been decreased
40% when compared with the original 1980 design.  A reduction
of some 15% - 30% was realized throughout the remainder of the
speed range.  The hull form had been tested to 80 knots without
exhibiting any dynamical instabilities.  Of great significance
is the fact that the dip in the resistance curve was now occurring
around a volumetric Froude number of 3.  Relating this to a 15
meter <BR><BR>

In 1995, the Boating Corporation of America (BCA) in Gallatin,
Tennessee, having become the first building licensee outside of
Australia, imported a mold and built a 40 ft. fiberglass test
boat in order to investigate the technical and market potentials
of the Stolkraft hull form.  The boat, during an extensive six
month trials program on nearby Old Hickory Lake, performed remar-
<P>
kably, and helped introduce the Stolkraft to government and private
industry interests in the United States.  The craft exhibited
high speeds, good load carrying capacity, and low fuel consumption
at cruising speed - over 1 mile per gallon.  Equipped with waterjets,
the boat was highly maneuverable, could crash stop in less than
two boat lengths, and walked laterally with ease.  Wake heights
of its three gentle rollers measured only 3.5 inches at a distance
of 100 feet with the boat traveling at 40 MPH.   This compares
with the 7.5 inch heights of the twelve to fifteen rollers of
a 40 foot BCA built Harbor Master monohull traveling at 30 MPH.

In 1996 the U.S. Navy, interested in applying the Stolkraft hull

million dollar series of resistance and sea keeping tests to 90
knots on a 1/10<SUP>th</SUP> scale model of the 17m Freemantle
pilot boat at the David Taylor Model Basin in Bethesda, Maryland.

the N.S.M.B. 1985 findings were confirmed, and that non-wetting
has been observed in the hump region, accounting for its low resistance.
 Furthermore, there are reports of the discovery of a second significant
dip at higher Froude numbers, indicating even more favorable prospects
for the future application of the Stolkraft to many high speed
commercial and military vessels.<BR>

The first proposed commercial application was in the early 1980's
for a passenger ferry, conceived at the request of the Public
Transport Commission of New South Wales for consideration and
evaluation for fast commuter service across Sydney's harbor, the
attraction being the absence of wave formation in the wake, and
consequently, the lack of erosion along the shorelines.  Although
never constructed, the design is noteworthy for its application
of marine gas turbines and waterjets to carry 250 passengers at
35 knots on a hull length of only 24.45 meters. <BR><BR>

<P>
The reasons for choosing the revolutionary Stolkraft hull form
was that it met the following criteria:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The desire to provide a more cost efficient service by reducing
the escalating running costs of the existing pilot boats which
had been built to traditional designs.
<LI>The requirement to keep wash effect to the very minimum, consistent
with operating at high speed through waters often crowded with
hundreds of recreational craft.
<LI>The need to provide a safe and stable platform for the boarding
and retrieval of pilots at higher speeds than the displacement
type pilot boats in use at that time.

In 1992 Broadwater Craft of Hope Harbour on the Gold Coast of
Australia built a 12.7 meter Stolkraft aluminum fast freighter,
the <I>MV PETERS</I>, for a client in Thailand who selected the
design for being able to satisfy the following service requirements:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Low wash to minimize damage to natural and structural river
bank features.
<LI>Hull form had to be able to be easily beached on river delta
sand banks.
<LI>Payload to displacement ratio of 50 percent.

smuggling.      Won against competing designs from Sweden, Japan,
Russia, and other countries, the Stolkraft design was selected
because it alone offered the ideal combination of desired characteristics:

In early 1996, Art Anderson Associates, due to their extensive
experience with wake/wash issues in Rich Passage near Bremerton,
Washington, was asked by the firm, Cross Sound Flyer Inc., to
recommend a design suitable to their unique service requirements:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Ability to transit Rich Passage at top service speed without
causing wake/wash and beach erosion problems to the residences
on either side of this narrow passage.
<LI>High service speed to keep commute times between Bremerton
and downtown Seattle to 35 minutes.
<LI>Good fuel economy to make the business, a privately-operated
venture, profitable.
<LI>Good seakeaping characteristics to handle almost all sea conditions
throughout the year on Puget Sound.
<LI>A capacity of around 149 passengers, in order to be built
according to the U.S. Coast Guard's Subchapter &quot;T&quot; rules.

<LI>An aesthetically pleasing design which would be attractive
to the ridership.
</UL>

<P>
According to these requirements the Stolkraft hull form was the
ideal choice, and the recommendation of Art Anderson Associates
in the form of a 22.3 meter vessel.  <BR><BR>

The Stolkraft hull form, with its unique combination of performance
characteristics - high speed, low wake/wash, low fuel consumption,
good seakeeping, high stability, excellent maneuverability, spacious
interiors, and large deck areas - remains a most viable and profitable
option for operators on rivers, lakes, bays, sounds, and coastal

We are entering our 17th consecutive year of primary engineering support to the 
NOAA Pacific Coast Fleet.  Our service to NOAA has ranged from developing plans, 
specifications and estimates for major upgrades to many of their vessels, to assisting 
NOAA in minor modifications and installation of winches, A-frames and J-frames.  We conducted 
USCG-witnessed inclining experiments and developed Trim and Stability Booklets for many of 
the NOAA vessels.  In conjunction with this, Art Anderson Associates developed a trim and 
stability computer program for faster and more convenient on-board use to determine vessel 
stability characteristics.<BR><BR>

In 1989 Tom Gentry held the transatlantic speed record.  When the record was broken two years 
later, Gentry set out to develop and new generation of ultra-fast yacht.  Art Anderson Associates, 
teamed with Gentry, spent three years in research and development of a new generation of 
Surface Effect Ship.  The resulting 185-foot yacht has a top speed of over 85-knots.<BR><BR>

Unfortunately, prior to construction, Gentry was fatally injured in a boating accident.<BR><BR>

Art Anderson Associates was responsible for procurement specifications for two, 300-passenger, 
32-knot ferry boats as well as design of a new Vallejo ferry terminal, and evaluation of 
moorage options.<BR><BR>

We conducted the vessel procurement activities, and assisted the City in contractor selection.  
We are currently providing construction management services as owner's representative in this 
procurement, including in-yard vessel inspection.  The project illustrates Art Anderson 
Associates' turnkey capabilities, providing engineering expertise for both the vessel and 
shoreside aspects of the project.  A notable outcome of this project is that the City of 
Vallejo will enjoy the first terminal in the Bay area to be fully ADA accessible 
throughout various tide conditions.<BR><BR>

Art Anderson Associates' personnel served as project engineers for the Turbine Repowering of 
Victoria Clipper IV.  Working with our client, Detroit Diesel, we developed design documents for 
United States Coast Guard and Det Norske Veritas approval.  This project involved removing 
two MTU diesels and replacing them with Allied Signal TF-40 turbines.  The result is a 25% 
increase in speed.<BR><BR>

Most remarkable in the Victoria Clipper IV work was the schedule.  The entire project, from 
design contract to re-delivery of the complete ship, took under just 4-1/2 months.<BR><BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have held many positions of responsibility during my career as a Naval Architect. In 1990 I was Head of Advanced Vehicle Design for the US Navy. In that job I had complete authority for technical execution of all phases of US Navy ship designs, from conceptual development through contract execution. I left that position in 1991 to relocate to San Diego and open a private consultancy. I later joined Art Anderson Associates where I have been appointed Principal In Charge of Naval Architecture.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have represented the United States as technical expert to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). I have represented the state-of-the-art in ship design to staff of the United States Congress, and I have represented my company before clients, and my clients before their customers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1989 I was a representative of the US Navy to the government of France as part of an engineer exchange program. While in France I was in charge of two French Navy design projects. I was also &quot;double-hatted&quot; as a member of the Consulate's Office of Defense Cooperation. In this capacity I maintained liaison between the French naval design staff and the US naval design staff in Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am known in many places as a specialist in advanced hull types, but this specialty is built on a foundation of sound basic naval architecture.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>My full resume presents a diverse and challenging collection of past assignments. I received those assignments because of my consistent demonstration of the following key attributes:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A willingness to accept responsibility and &quot;self start.&quot; I was selected to spend a year representing the US Navy in the offices of the French Navy in Paris. Clearly this position is somewhat ambassadorial in nature, and it will only be given to an employee that makes the best impression possible.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>The ability to use good judgment and produce consistently excellent technical and programmatic decisions. I headed a project at NAVSEA wherein I reported directly to a manager five levels above me, with only one intervening supervisor. The fact that my management was willing to allow me this visibility suggests the level of confidence they felt in my decision-making ability.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Solid basic engineering and Naval Architecture skills. I have never tried to &quot;baffle them with BS.&quot;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Speed. I am frequently assigned tasks because of their very short fuses. I once was handed a totally unsatisfactory 600-page design report and told to pull together a clear, consistent, and professional engineering treatment of the project. I was given two weeks to accomplish this. The task was successful and I ended up making the resulting presentation to NATO personally.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Communication skills. I am good at and comfortable with both written and verbal communications. I have produced a broad range of technical reports, and many briefings to US and foreign senior personnel.</FONT> 
</UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The yachting community has been my avocation rather than vocation, but I have nonetheless maintained a significant level of activity therein. I have been a long time member of the Society of Naval Architect's technical and research panel on sailing yacht design. I have twice been a member of the papers committee for the Chesapeake Sailing Yacht Symposium, one of this nation's premier yachting forums. I have over 2,000 miles of blue water cruising experience. I am a boat owner.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The combination of my love of the sea, my appreciation for and understanding of the needs of the seaman, and my technical training as a naval architect gives me a unique balance of skills.</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

Egyptian Kingdoms is a MUTE (Multi-User Tournament Enviroment) designed by <a href="james.htm">James Fike</a> (Ra).  The Egyptian Kingdoms (EK) is designed for entertainment that is more fast paced than an ordinary mud and has had may features added to change the way it is played.  EK is much like Netrek.  There are two teams with simular bases on the opposite sides of the world.  Players get the most experience and kill points by killing other players.  The object of a game at EK is to get 12 players connected to start Tournament Mode then kill the opposing teams Pharaoh.

<dd><font size=5><b>H</b></font>owdy!  Thanks for stopping by my home page.  As you can see I like Egyptian things.  Let me tell you a little about my self.  I was born on January 20, 1974, in Murray, Utah.  I lived in Bluffdale, Utah, for most of my life going to school at <a href="http://m.binghs.jordan.k12.ut.us/">Bingham High</a>.  I graduated in 1992 and got a scholarship at <a href="http://www.usu.edu">Utah State University</a> in art.  I have been going to school at USU since then.  For the last two and a half years I have been working on a project which I have called <a href="index.htm">Egyptian Kingdoms</a> a MUTE (Multi User Tournament Environment). To find out more about my credentials check out my <a href="resume.htm">resume'</a>.  I work for the <a href="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/docs/index.htm">Utah Office of Energy Services</a> developing their web site.  Directed by <a href="http://www.usu.edu/~asteweb/docs/steve.html">Dr. Stephen E.

<br>
<B>PROLOG</B>
<br>
"I am the hope!"<br><br>
The darkness replied, "You are their end."<br>
<dd>Armagniam reached forth into the darkness of the tide and found the circle he desired. 
Trembling from the fear and anxiety of what he was about to do he hesitated in his song his grip
wavered only slightly but long enough to allow the shadowed hands, within the darkness, the
chance for which they waited.  Reacting instantly, the pain streaked though Armagniam's body as
the familiar chill of the tide dug it's claws into his soul.  The hands wrapped around his.  They
were engaged.<br><br>
"The worlds are one.", Armagniam whispered.<br>
<dd>The darkness once again replied, "Your soul, like the worlds, are at their end."  He was
being pulled disappear than he had ever been.  The power of the magic which is call the Tide had
it's own soul and it wanted Armagniam's.<br>
<dd>Armagniam neared the end of the song only a few more unsure verses remained.  He knew
not weather he spoke or thought the words to the song.  Only the words, the circle, and the pain
remained.  The darkness grew and the circle started to form that would forever close the gates to
the Tide.  The shadows tightened it's grasp as it pulled Armagniam deeper.  This time the
shadowed hands knew they had won.  Armagniam could dare not turn to fight them for he could
not lose control of the circle he had already summoned.<br>
<dd>"This circle will close the tide forever.", Armagniam whispered through the pain in his head.<br>
<dd>The darkness replied, "The tides doth always turn boy."  Laughter and the screams of the tortured
filled Armagniam's head as the shadows wrapped around his soul.  The darkness flowed and
burned within his veins like the poison of the ice cobra.  He finished the last verse.  All that was
left was the darkness, eternal darkness, and the circle that would forever close the gates to the
tide.  Just as the circle fated red, signaling that the spell was complete, came the small twinkling
of silver at his side.  A small dagger appeared newt to him.  In a flash the dagger struck the darkness
that was the shadowed hands.  The darkness howled and screamed in pain and frustration.  Two
small hands reached forth into the darkness and engaged the shadows that were pulling
Armagniam into the darkness.<br>
<dd> "Wait!  Don't release it!"<br><br>
<b>Chapter 1<br>
The Gathering</b><br>
<dd>Bane sat in the darkest corner of the Flanking Bar.  Cloaked in dark robes and trained not
to be seen only the person that looked closely would ever have noticed him there.  Laughter and
song combined with the smoke and aroma of the liquor filled the room.  An occasional ray of
light would escape the crowed of men and women dancing around the stove to land upon the
table only to dance in its moment of freedom, before it was again swallowed by the crowd.  Bane
observed in silence the people dancing.  How carefree they all seemed.  Bane had never been one
to interact freely with people.  He had been taught his entire life not to trust the guy, girl, or child
next to him.  For in his line of work honor was only to the guild and not to its members.  Bane's
hand absent mindedly found one of his many hidden daggers strapped to the inside
of his arm.  The dagger was small and should not be that threatening but Bane had made this
dagger himself and knew how deadly it was.  The hilt was hollowed out and filled with the sap of
the night rose tree.  A small needle sized hole was then drilled up the middle of the blade to the
point where a small amount of a special wax was used to cloak the sap from running out.  Upon
finding a victim the wax should melt and within seconds the sap would run into the victims
blood causing the victim to fall paralyzed to the ground.  Bane had only used this dagger twice. 
Bane smiled as he remembered the faces of the men he had used it on.  They had not expected
Bane to be much of a threat seeing that he was only 5 feet 4 inches tall and little over 110
pounds.  They had caught him admiring their fathers gold chests.  Both men being members of
the guard pulled their swords and grabbed Bane before he had time to turn and run.  The bigger
of the two pulled Bane's hands around his back and forced him to his knees.  As the other one
readied his sword at the left of Bane's neck.  Bane with the dexterity and speed of a cat turned his
wrist releasing the mechanism, with the flick of his wrist, that held the dagger tied to his arm. 
The dagger found its way into the man's wrist behind him.  Pulling his hand away from the sting
of the little dagger gave Bane the seconds he needed to turn, roll to his side and send the dagger
flying into the leg of the man holding his sword.  Bane could still remember cleaning his little
blade on the shirts of the men, not to mention a fair amount of silver from their pockets, as they
stared helplessly up at him totally paralyzed for the rest of their lives.<br>
<dd>Bane's thoughts came quickly back to him as the song changed to a lighter beat that many
of the younger men and women were very fond of.  Unlike the customary dancing were men and
women merely skipped and frolicked around with each other.  This new dance combined the
slow slow fast fast step along with the man holding the hands of the women and spinning them in
all sorts of ways.  Bane was fond of the new dance and had even thought about trying it once, but
Bane knew he never could.  Bane envied the young men that turned the women so gracefully,
while not worrying what the man behind him was doing.  Bane was particularly found of a move
that had come to be known as the pretzel.  The men would hold on to the women's hands as they
turned and bent their arms around one another.  Just as it would seem that they were going to be
tied forever in a knot they would end up standing next to one another in an embrace still stepping
to the slow slow fast fast beat of the music.  As the song started to near it's end the door to the
bar opened and a giant man accompanied by a short well build dwarf who was obviously of many
circles stepped in.<br>
<dd>Bane knew the men as his companions.  The giant's name was Caragnian Salt and the
dwarfs name was Stout Ironfist.  Many years ago Bane, Caragnian, and Stout had traveled
together in the hunt for a family of bearlings that had moved in close to the village and had killed
a family of farmers.  The bearlings are like the bear only they are much faster and are far more
intelligent.  Some bearlings have even been known to use the poser of the tides.  Bane had joined
the hunt because of the tails that bearlings often had large caches of gems and diamonds stored in
their dens.  Caragnian because of this unwavering strength and courage and Stout had been
appointed by the council to lead the hunt because of his many years of service with the knights of
the tide.  There had been fifteen men originally in the party.  It was around the end of the hot
months when they set out into the hill in search of the bearlings.  Bane mostly stayed to the
flanks of the party.  Never speaking just watching and waiting he could still remember the morning that
they ran across the bearling tracks.  They were in the canyon of two rather steep forest covered
hills.  Caragnian was at guard in the rear by Bane and Stout was in the lead.  Bane still
remembered Caragnian's huge arms flexing and trembling as his hand went to his sword in
anticipation of the fight.  They followed the tracks about a mile up canyon until the tracks
disappeared into a small creek.  The men started searching frantically for the tracks and broke
rank.  Second's later the bearlings were all over the place.  Bane could still remember the first
blood filled scream that echoed through the forest.  It was soon followed by many more.  The
men that had broke rank were easy targets and stood little chance against the bearlings that
hunted in small packs.  Stout directed the men to fall back but it was to late for the ones that had
broke rank.  Only the six men that had stayed in their ranks were left after the first few seconds. 
Stout instructed Bane and One other guy to grab their cross bows and fire on the bearlings as they
approached.  Bane had poisoned his arrows before they had left for the hunt just as a precaution. 
Which, turned out to be very helpful for the bearlings were half animal and took 3 or 4 arrows to
kill.  Stout, Caragnian and two others took stands around Bane and the other archer.  The
bearlings turned and charged into the men.  The battle seamed to take hours but Bane was sure
that it had all taken place within a half of an hour.  When the battle was over Bane was standing
with a large dagger in both hands and covered in blood.  Stout was injured slightly but had still
fallen many of the bearlings.  Caragnian had piled up many bearlings in front of him and had
protected Stout when he fell.  The other three men had fallen to their deaths during the battle. 
Stout Caragnian, and Bane became very close after that hunt.  They went on many other hunting
parties after that together.  Then two years ago Bane came of age.<br>
<dd>In Bane's line of work there comes a time when the person reaches the age of 21 and they
must travel to the city of Ice Lake far to the north.  Secure in the mountains near Ice Lake lies the
main guild of thieves, robbers, and assassin's.  The guild members referred to the guild as the
pack.  And Bane was now a full fledged member of the pack.<br>
<dd>Bane watched as Stout and Caragnian walked to a table near the north wall.  Caragnian
whistled and motioned for a server as soon as they had reached the table.  A small red haired
girl, who Bane knew as Rue, came bouncing up to Caragnian with two mugs and a picture of
Ale.  Caragnian pinched Rues butt as she left their table.  As she walked by Banes table on her
way back to the kitchen Bane noticed Rues face bright red, yet she was smiling.  Bane also
noticed that Rue was more a woman now than she had been two years ago.  Rue's figure had
blossomed while he was away.  Bane wondered how Caragnian was handling the change. 
Obviously, he had noticed it.  Rue came skipping by again.  She had gathered herself now and
was carrying a basket of potato logs and another picture of Ale.  She placed the potato's and Ale
on the Stout and Caragnian's table then speed off to check on her other tables.<br>
<dd>Bane decided it was time to surprise his friends.  Bane stood up from his seat and walked
over to their table.  When he approached Stout looked up to see him standing there.  A big smile
came over his face.  Stout jumped up and was squeezing Bane all to quickly.<br>
<dd>"What in the tide are you doing here boy?" Stout blurted out as he swung him around. 
Bane would have loved to answer but there was no air in his lung for which to speak.  Caragnian
was on his feet now and was grabbing Stout and Bane in a Bear hug.  Bane was just wondering
why he called these people his friends when a soft somewhat familiar ladies voice rescued him,
"You guys going to give me a chance at him."  Caragnian put Stout and Bane down and Stout
released Bane.  A little dizzy and thankful for the air his lungs now received.  Rue practically a
sister to him grabbed him around the neck and kissed him on the cheek.  Stout motioned Bane to
sit down as Rue's mouth started to go, "How are you doing? Oh you wouldn't believe the things
that are happening around here!  Stout here opened his own armory.  It's just the best store I have
ever seen.  And Caragnian is now the best house builder in all the land.  Oh and you know my
old house well Caragnian built me a new one down by the river.  It is so beautiful."  Just then she
had to take a breath.<br>
<dd>Caragnian acting very quickly reached around and muzzled her mouth.  He had just
returned from getting more ale for himself and Bane.  "Now now Rue," Caragnian said as he
place a mug of Ale in front of Bane, "you'll have all the time in the world to catch up with Bane. 
Let's hear what exciting stories bane has to tell."<br>
<dd>Stout interrupting blurted out, "Wait a minute Caragnian! The first thing I want to know is
weather your covenant with me not to use any of your thieve skills on me or my house is still in
effect?"  Stout stood as he playfully placed his hand on the hold of his sword.<br>
<dd>"Oh of coarse.  Oh of coarse it still holds," Bane said with a smile, "in fact, I just found a
money pouch here that looks an awful lot like yours.  You must have dropped it."  Bane produced
Stouts money pouch which he had secured during their bear hug reunion from within his cloak. 
Bane grinned as he knew this was the first thing Stout would ask.  Stout's mouth gaped open as
his hand went inside his cloak to the empty pocket he had had his money pouch only minutes
ago.<br>
<dd>"Don't worry Stout I think I found it before anyone had a chance to steal anything," Bane
teased.  Stout's face was turning bright red.  Flustered and without words Stout sat down hardly
upon the booth and emptied his coins before him.  "Now lets see how much this little cat took
from me this time." Stout injected.<br>
<dd>"Oh come on Stout.  You heard Bane he simply found your purse," Caragnian, jumping
in on the fun, said with an infisist on found.  Stout only placed his arm protectedly around his
coins, which he was promptly stacking upon one another.  This was about as much as Rue could
handle.  Suddenly she cracked.  She could not hold it back any longer.  She fell to the ground
laughing and holding her side.  Then Caragnian broke.  Their laughter was distinctly different, yet
comicly in harmony.  Rues laughter was more of a uncontrolled giggle in very high pitches. 
On the other hand Caragnian's was a slow bellow louder than a war cry or at lease any war cry
Bane had ever heard.<br><br>

The data for this table are derived from energy audits completed for Utah institutions participating in the US Department of Energy's Institutional Conservation Program and the Utah Local Government Technology Demonstration Program from 1978-1995.  The data are compiled for over 850 buildings.  Institutions interested in comparative performance data should consider the averages for their building type under "average annual consumption: BTU/GSF."  The consumption data listed were compiled before energy conservation measures were implemented and are not climate-adjusted.  For those buildings retrofitted under either program, the Utah Office of Energy Services determined the average first year reduction in energy use to be 10.3% with an average simple payback of measures of 4.47 years.</td></tr></table>

<font size=5>Utah Case Study #1: Central Energy Management Control System: </font> <br>
<dd>In 1979, many of Davis County School District's 96 buildings
were "running wild" with energy consumptions 30 per cent higher (in BTUs) than now being consumed.
 The district energy manager,  Bernell Loveridge, succeeded in dropping district energy consumption in spite
of the district adding 12,000 computers since the base year.  The Davis School District has installed and manages a computer based and centralized energy control system.  The district's energy consumption in 1994/95 was $350,000 lower than 1993/94
out of a $5.0 million district-wide budget.  The consumption for 1994/95 equates to a $2.0 million savings 
compared with the original 1979 baseline.<br><br>

<font size=5>Utah Case Study #2: District Wide Building Retrofits:</font> <br>
<dd>Between 1985 and 1988 the Box Elder School District's energy bills 
more than doubled from $500,000 t0 $1,200,000.  Through Dr. Darwin Woodbury's leadership as energy manager, 
the district saved over $1.25 million dollars since 1988.  Besides comprehensive retrofits on all buildings, the district also developed 
a program for regularly scheduled maintenance to ensure that savings are maintained over time.  Examples of retrofits
completed include: boiler replacements and upgrades, three swimming pool covers, lighting retrofit s (T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts), control 
upgrades (primarily for setback), vestibules and insulation where necessary.<br><br>

<font size=5>Utah Case Study #3: Energy Efficient Design (ASHRAE 90.1): </font> <br>
<dd>Oquirrh Elementary School in Jordon School District was destroyed by a fire in 1995.  The cause of the fire was an old
mangnetic ballast.  When the district considered building a new school on the same site,  district officials,  the artchitect, and
design engineers decided to incorporate a number of cost-effective energy savings features.<br>
<dd>The new school is the same square footage as the old school and accommodates the number of students.  However, the new
school includes Low-E glass;  compact flourescents in the recessed fixtures; T-8 flourescent lamps with electronic ballasts;
 buildings controls connected to the districts central energy management system for scheduling and set-backs; vestibules; a light
colored roofing to reduce cooling loads;  high pressure sodium exterior lamps; energy efficient skylights in the corridors,
gym and library;  and  a boiler/chiller system instead of rooftop units.  Whereas, some schools are an "X" or "L" shape, the
design of the new Oquirrh Elementary School is a more compact and energy efficient rectangle.  Duane Devey, energy manager for 
Jordan School District, says, "This list of energy efficiency measures should be on every district's checklist for new construction
- think of the long-term savings."<br>
<dd>Devey notes, "With a computer history of energy use at the old Oquirrh Elementary school, we have been able to track some 
great savings attributable to the new school's energy savings feature - $11,000 in electrical savings in the first six months
of 1996!"

<font size=5>Utah Case Study #4: New Lights Saving Energy: </font> <br>
<dd>Energy usage roports show that Sevier School District is conserving energy thanks to a project where new lights and ballasts were installed throughout the district last year.
<dd>Direct savings of $32,000 this year as a result of the project are being applied toward paying off the 10-year loan for purchase and installation of the lights, Ross-Franks, district maintenance supervisor, told the Sevier School District Board of Education at a meeting held Oct. 17 at South Sevier Middle School, Monroe.
<dd>Better Light to enhance learning and getting rid of potentially harmful ballasts were other benefits of the project.
<dd>The old ballasts sometimes dripped hot tar crating a fire hazard explained Sam Ware, business administrator.  The "flickering" light from old ballasts could also cause headaches in some people, added Franks.  (Richfield Reaper Oct 1996)

<font size=5>Utah Case Study #5: Changing Lights in Municipal Buildings Saves Money and Environment: </font> <br>
<dd>Provo is saving money and the environment just by changing a few light bulbs.
<dd>The city saved $36,678 in energy costs for the year and recuced carbon diozide emissions by more than 700 tons annually by changing the lights used in siz city buildings.
<dd>The city made the lighting changes under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights Program.
<dd>Kate Lewis, Green Lights communications manager, said the program fosters voluntary partnerships between the EPA and businesses and government agencies in reducing energy use and pollution.
<dd>Lewis said participants in the program agree to assess their existing lighting fixtures and look for ways to upgrade to more energy-efficient devices.
<dd>The participants have to upgrade either 90 percent of the light fixtures or as many devices as are economically feasible to change.
<dd>The EPA provides technical expertise, including computer software to evaluate various lighting methods and unbiased reports of the available technology.
<dd>The agency also helps participants share information on upgrading their systems.
<dd>Scott Glazier, of Provo Energy Services, said the city entered into an agreement with the EPA in April 1994.  Since then, the city has changed light fixtures in City Hall, the Public Library, the Eldred Center, the recreation center, the energy department's building and the water resources building.
<dd>Among the lighting changes provo made were replacing 196-watt fluorescent light fiztures with newer 10-watt lamps, which provide thw same amount of light, and installling 13=watt floodlights in City Hall instead of 75-150 watt lights.
<dd>Glazier said Provo went beyond lights in saving energy.  The city installed more efficient fans and cooling devices on the ventilation system, an energysaving pump on a city well and a computer to regulate the heating and cooling system to a building's actual use.
<dd>The upgrades cost $800,000 over two years, but the city is saving $81,000 a year on its electric bill, Glazier said.
<dd>On the lighting alone, the city is saving $36,578 a year and reducing the carbon dioxide production.

<CENTER><font size=6><b>Energy Myths Cost Utah Consumers</b></center></table>
<hr noshade>
<dd>Four common energy myths cost Utah homeowners, businesses and public
agencies hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in utility costs. "These myths
arose in 1940s and 1950s when energy was cheap and technologies were inefficient,"
said Utah Office of Energy Services Information Specialist Denise Beaudoin. "The
most persistent myth is that you should leave fluorescent lights on because it takes
more energy to turn them off, then on again. New fluorescent fixtures with electronic
ballasts should be turned off whenever you leave a room. The savings are
instantaneous. With older fluorescent light technology, the two-minute rule prevails:
when you leave a room for more than two minutes, turn the lights off." This myth may
be the reason school and business lights are often left on long after business hours
and only turned off after cleaning crews have finished their work. According to
Beaudoin, an extra hour a day of unnecessary lighting can increase electricity costs by
5 to 10 percent per month.
<dd>The other three myths are similar. "Many people still believe that furnace
thermostats should not be turned down at night because it takes more energy than it
saves to reheat a home or building in the morning," said Beaudoin. For homes with no
infants or elderly residents, a night-time setting of 60 to 65 degrees is recommended
with 55 to 60 degree setting for office buildings and schools. "Homes with night-setback
thermostats and buildings with computerized energy management systems
warm up before residents arise or workers arrive," said Beaudoin. "Setting the
thermostat back at night in unoccupied buildings can cut energy costs by 10 percent a
month," she added.
<dd>A third energy myth is that you should leave your car running at drive-up
windows because it takes more energy to restart the engine. "For most gasoline
powered vehicles, we recommend turning your car off if you expect to idle for more than
thirty seconds," said Beaudoin. "Each two minutes an automobile idles is equivalent to
driving one mile. And, an idling car produces more harmful emissions that contribute to
air pollution."
<dd>Leaving computers on overnight to prevent computer damage is the fourth myth.
Personal computers with an Energy Star rating can be put in 'sleep mode' when not in
use to save energy. Personal computers in homes, schools, or offices should be
turned off during lunch hours, overnight and on weekends. "It pays to shut them off,"
said Beaudoin. "In a recent Saturday visit to a local building, twenty-seven computers
and monitors had been left on over the weekend. Those twenty-seven computers will
cost between $800 and $900 more a year in electricity charges."

Services HOTLINE at 1-800-662-3633 or 538-8662.

<br><br>Dear Administrator or Energy Specialist:                                
<br>Feb. 20, 1996
<br><br><dd>Congress has "zeroed" out the Institutional Conservation Program which offered grants
to Utah schools, hospitals and higher education. We do not expect additional program
funds for 1996 or any year thereafter.
<br><br><dd>Energy efficiency opportunities in your buildings may still need capital. Four sources of
capital deserve your careful attention:

<OL>
<LI><b>Energy Service Companies </b>- These companies provide technical expertise and financing for a
guaranteed savings. Successful Utah projects include Sevier School District, Utah State Hospital, Grand
School District, and Utah National Guard.<br><br>

<LI><b>Utah Power's FinAnswer Program </b>- Utah Power has streamlined their program to finance energy
improvements at low-interest rates. Customers pay off improvements using their monthly utility savings as
part of the monthly utility bill. Successful projects have been completed at Jordan School District, Grand
County, Salt Palace, and Hill Air Force Base.<br><br>

<LI><b>Internal Capital </b>- Some energy efficiency projects are so cost-effective that an institution could use their
current year operation's budget to finance energy upgrades. Lighting projects can be funded using this
method of financing since they can have a payback of less than one year.<br><br>

<LI><b>Zero-interest State Energy Loan Fund </b>- The Office of Energy Services is offering $400,000 in zero-interest loans to non-state owned public institutions for energy improvements where paybacks do not
exceed 10 years. Minimum loans are $5,000 and maximum loans are $100,000. Awards are competitive
based upon cost-effectiveness. Application forms for Phase 1 are due <b>May 1, 1996 </b>(see attached form).<br><br>
</OL>
<br>
<dd>Please call if you have any questions.<br>

<br>

If you're feeling gouged by the price of gasoline these days, the Office of Energy Services
has some tips to help you make that precious fuel last a bit longer.
<ul>
<br>1. Avoid excessive idling.  An idling vehicle gets zero miles per gallon.    Plus, an idling engine
produces more air pollution.  Turn off and restart your engine if you're going to idle more
than 30 seconds.<br>
<br>2. Combine short trips.  The worst gasoline mileage is on trips of 10 miles or less from a cold
start.  Plan your trips and combine errands.  Consolidated trips reduce the number of miles
driven. <br>
<br>3. Keep tires inflated at the psi level indicated on your tires.  Underinflated tires waste fuel
and increase tire wear.  During warm weather, close your windows when driving at
highways speeds and use your air-conditioner.  For in-town driving, open windows and
turn off your air conditioner.  Avoid using permanent roof racks and bug deflectors that add to wind drag.  Also, remove excess weight from car. <br>
<br>4. Keep your car properly tuned.  Two bad spark plugs can reduce gas mileage by 20 percent. 
Proper vehicle maintenance saves gas and money and reduces engine wear. <br>
<br>5. Consider using an alternative fuel.  Natural gas costs are between 60 cents and 70 cents less
per gallon than the present cost of gasoline and it produces far less air pollution. Vehicles
converted to operate on cleaner-burning fuels such as natural gas can be switched back to
gasoline when the alternative fuel isn't available. <br>
<br>6. An automobile warms up faster when it is moving.  Drive at a moderate speed until the engine reaches its normal operating temperature.  When in doubt, check the owner's manual.<br>
<br>7. Accelerate smoothly to reach cruising speed as quickly as traffic allows.  Your car uses more fuel accelerating than cruising.  Anticipate driving conditions.  Keep an eye on traffic flow and timing of traffic signals.  Avoid constant accelerating, braking and decelerate smoothly. Listen to traffic reports to avoid routes that are clogged with "stop" and "go" traffic.<br>
<br>8. Drive at moderate speeds not to exceed the speed limit.  At 55 mph, a vehicle gets 21 percent better mileage than one traveling 70 miles per hour.  Also, your car's emissions are cleanest at 55 mph.<br>
<br>9. Consider buying a fuel-efficient car.<br>
<br>10. Try carpooling or riding the bus.  You can save between $300 and $1,000 annually by
sharing a ride to work or by riding the bus.<br>
<br>11. Try working a compressed work week to reduce the number of days you have to commute
to work.  Walk or bike if you're traveling a short distance.<br>
</ul>
<dd>"Using these tips will help avoid some stops at the local gas station, and some of them can
also help improve the air quality in our communities" said Energy Program Manager, Joe
Waller.  For more information, contact the Office of Energy Services at 538-8662 or 1-800-662-3633. <p>

<hr noshade>
<dd>As the marketplace becomes increasingly competitive, companies are looking for
ways to reduce operating costs.  Improving energy efficiency in facilities is one way to
accomplish this.  The use of energy-efficient technologies can increase a company's
financial edge and also benefit the community by reducing pollution and enhancing
aesthetics, safety and comfort of facilities.
<dd>A significant barrier to performing energy-efficient upgrades are capital costs.
To overcome this barrier, the Utah Office of Energy Services has established a $1
million low-interest loan program for energy improvements.  Minimum loans are $5,000
and maximum loans are $100,000, with a maximum 5-year payback.  Awards are
competitive based on cost-effectiveness and on a first-come first-serve basis.
<dd>The program targets two specific areas of technology, lighting and electrical
motor systems:<br><br>
<img src="/images/pin.gif" border=0 align=absmiddle> <b>LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES</b><ul>
       Lighting is often the first place to look for potential energy savings because new
       technologies are proven and changes are easy to make.  A variety of new
       lighting technologies are available in the marketplace.  Measures funded under
       the program include:
       <li> <B>electronic ballasts</B> power fluorescent lamps for 60 percent less energy
       <li><B> T-8 fluorescent tubes</B> provide an array of color temperatures (cool versus
             warm) and color rendition capabilities to replicate the "true" colors seen in
             daylight
        <li> <B>compact fluorescent</B> produce about five times more light per watt
       <li><B> motion sensors</B> turn off lights automatically when space is unoccupied
      <li> <B>reflectors</B> concentrate light in desired areas
       <li> <B>high intensity discharged (HID) lights</B> (mercury vapor, metal halide and
             sodium), long lasting and extremely efficient, are used for various
             applications both in-doors and outside.
       <li><B> EXIT signs retrofit kits</B> consist of compact fluorescent replacements or the
             newer LED signs which use a mere 2 watts.
   <li><B> energy management systems</B> control lighting for occupancy and daylight</ul>
<img src="/images/pin.gif" border=0 align=absmiddle> <b>MOTOR TECHNOLOGIES</b><ul>
       Electric motors account for about three-quarters of total electricity use in industry
       and half of the electricity use in commercial buildings.  Electric motors are used
       to power heating/ventilating/air-conditioning (HVAC) and refrigerating systems,
       elevators, conveyor belts, printing presses, blowers and pumps, and are used in
       a wide variety of manufacturing and assembly equipment.  Electric motor
       efficiency measures funded under the program include:
             <li> properly sized motors
              <li> high efficiency motors
             <li> variable speed drives</ul>

<b>Model Energy Code 1993 for Residences</b><p>

<p>

	The 1993 Council of American Building Officials Model Energy Code (MEC) is the required
energy code for all residential buildings three stories or less in Utah.  New structures must meet
minimum MEC standards.  Areas of the state with colder climates have more stringent
requirements than areas with a warmer climate.  New Utah homes meeting MEC93 will recap
each dollar associated with code compliance within two-and- a-half years through utility savings.<p>

<p>

	In most geographic areas, builders will install R-30 to R-38 ceiling insulation; R-13 to R-19 wall
insulation; windows with U-Values between .4 and .5, basement or floor insulation; foundation
insulation in slab-on-grade construction; and furnaces with efficiencies between 78 percent and 95
percent Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency <p>

(AFUE).   Builders are encouraged to meet the highest practical standard.<p>

<p>

	Four methods of compliance are available.  <p>

<p>

1.	<u>MECcheck Energy Code Compliance software.</u>  This method is a very simple easy-to-use DOS-based computer program that looks and works like Windows.  It provides an instant whole-house
compliance analysis and allows heating and cooling equipment trade-offs for higher efficiency
units.  This method is the choice for most people because of its ease, speed and flexibility.  The
printout generated from this program must be submitted with the building permit application. <p>

<p>

2.	<u>MECcheck prescriptive packages.</u>  This method offers 20 different packages of energy options for
each of Utah's many climate regions.  Compliance is reached when each and every requirement for
a particular package is met.  This method offers a wide variety of options and does not require
any calculations. <p>

<p>

3.	<u>MECcheck trade-off approach.</u>  This method allows manual calculations to determine whether
overall heat loss of a proposed dwelling is less than that of the  Model Energy Code house. 
Excessive heat loss in one building section may be offset by reducing heat loss in other building
sections.  This method is less flexible than software approaches and is more tedious due to the
manual calculations required.  A trade-off worksheet must be submitted when using this approach.<p>

<p>

4.	<u>MEC systems analysis.</u>  This is the most complicated method of energy code
compliance and also the most costly.  It is the most flexible and forgiving method available. 
This system analysis is usually provided by engineering firms.  It requires calculating
energy use in the building.  By taking all energy use into account, this method is less
restrictive than the other three methods.<p>

Utah adopted the ASHRAE 90.1 for all commercial industrial buildings and MEC 93 for all residential buildings in
February 1993.  Commercial / Industrial sized buildings adhering to ASHRAE 90.1 use 18 percent less energy
compared to similarly sized buildings constructed under the old standard.  Questions regarding ASHRAE 90.1 for
Utah should be addressed to Mr. Jerry Zinger (801) 581-6348.

<title>Driving Tips to Help Take the Bite Out Of Gasoline Hikes</title>

<hr noshade><br>
<br>

If you're feeling gouged by the price of gasoline these days, the Office of Energy Services
has some tips to help you make that precious fuel last a bit longer.
<ul>
<br>1. Avoid excessive idling.  An idling vehicle gets zero miles per gallon.    Plus, an idling engine
produces more air pollution.  Turn off and restart your engine if you're going to idle more
than 30 seconds.<br>
<br>2. Combine short trips.  The worst gasoline mileage is on trips of 10 miles or less from a cold
start.  Plan your trips and combine errands.  Consolidated trips reduce the number of miles
driven. <br>
<br>3. Keep tires inflated at the psi level indicated on your tires.  Underinflated tires waste fuel
and increase tire wear.  During warm weather, close your windows when driving at
highways speeds and use your air-conditioner.  For in-town driving, open windows and
turn off your air conditioner.  Avoid using permanent roof racks and bug deflectors that add to wind drag.  Also, remove excess weight from car. <br>
<br>4. Keep your car properly tuned.  Two bad spark plugs can reduce gas mileage by 20 percent. 
Proper vehicle maintenance saves gas and money and reduces engine wear. <br>
<br>5. Consider using an alternative fuel.  Natural gas costs are between 60 cents and 70 cents less
per gallon than the present cost of gasoline and it produces far less air pollution. Vehicles
converted to operate on cleaner-burning fuels such as natural gas can be switched back to
gasoline when the alternative fuel isn't available. <br>
<br>6. An automobile warms up faster when it is moving.  Drive at a moderate speed until the engine reaches its normal operating temperature.  When in doubt, check the owner's manual.<br>
<br>7. Accelerate smoothly to reach cruising speed as quickly as traffic allows.  Your car uses more fuel accelerating than cruising.  Anticipate driving conditions.  Keep an eye on traffic flow and timing of traffic signals.  Avoid constant accelerating, braking and decelerate smoothly. Listen to traffic reports to avoid routes that are clogged with "stop" and "go" traffic.<br>
<br>8. Drive at moderate speeds not to exceed the speed limit.  At 55 mph, a vehicle gets 21 percent better mileage than one traveling 70 miles per hour.  Also, your car's emissions are cleanest at 55 mph.<br>
<br>9. Consider buying a fuel-efficient car.<br>
<br>10. Try carpooling or riding the bus.  You can save between $300 and $1,000 annually by
sharing a ride to work or by riding the bus.<br>
<br>11. Try working a compressed work week to reduce the number of days you have to commute
to work.  Walk or bike if you're traveling a short distance.<br>
</ul>
<dd>"Using these tips will help avoid some stops at the local gas station, and some of them can
also help improve the air quality in our communities" said Energy Program Manager, Joe
Waller.  For more information, contact the Office of Energy Services at 538-8662 or 1-800-662-3633. <p>

<ul>
<li>One of the largest road-blocks to energy efficiency measures is the funding of
such projects.  The Utah Commercial/industrial Energy Efficiency Program helps
Utah companies gain access to sources of capital funding.  One of these
sources is the <a href="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/docs/cloan.htm">Utah Commercial/Industrial Energy Loan Program.</a><br>

<li>PacifiCorp customers should investigate Utah Power's Energy Finanswer
Program.  For more information about this capital projects loan program call
PacifiCorp's Energy Services Hot line at 1-800-222-4335.<br>

<li>It is possible to competitively select a professional energy service company
(ESCO) to provide capital for energy efficiency improvements on a guaranteed
basis.  Under such an arrangement, the ESCO provides expertise and financing
to install energy efficiency measurers and guarantees the energy saving will
exceed measure and guarantees the energy savings will exceed the financing
payments.  For a list of Utah ESCOs and an easy guide to using ESCOs you
may view the pamphlet entitled <a href="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/docs/title.htm">Energy Services Companies: Leveraging Money
for Energy Efficiency Improvements.</a><br>

<li>Provo City Corporation is presently structuring a low-interest loan program for its
commercial and industrial customers.  For more information about this capital
projects program contact Scott Glazier at (801) 379-6809.<br>

<p>

	The flat plate solar collector can be a cost effective way to heat water for the home domestic hot
water system.  Hot water is consumed by most families at about the same rate on a year round
basis, so domestic hot water needs go right on through the spring, summer and fall, when the
space heating system may be shut down.  Water-main temperatures will usually run higher in
summer than winter, thus requiring less energy to heat the consumable hot water.<p>

<p>

	Natural gas rates are generally lower in the summer time.  Considering the factors mentioned
above, estimating the cost of hot water on the basis of a monthly bill in the summer when the
furnace is shut down may not be too accurate.<p>

<p>

	The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in their publication "Hot Water From
the Sun", gives the annual savings in kilowatt hours of electricity and therms of natural gas for
Salt Lake City as follows:<p>

<p>

	If you know what you are paying for a kilowatt hour of electricity or therm of natural gas,
you can obtain a dollar estimate of savings through the use of solar flat plate collectors.  The
savings realized will vary with weather conditions from year to year, household consumption,
efficiency and design of the system and the storage capacity of the solar unit.<p>

<p>

	Another approach to estimating solar savings is to use a percentage of your costs for
heating energy.  Domestic hot water will account for somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of
the fuel heating bill.  Flat plate solar collectors will normally provide from 50 to 80 percent of the
hot water needs depending upon installation, design, and location in the state.<p>

<p>

	The two types of collectors on display are designed for cold climates.  The "open loop
system with drain-down freeze protection" is the least expensive of the two.  The freeze
protection is provided by draining the collectors when the temperature on the collector plate
drops to near freezing.  On a sunny day the collector plate can be warm enough to heat water
when the air temperature is well below freezing.  This system also has a "fail-safe" provision
which drains the system whenever the electric power fails.<p>

<p>

The "Closed-loop system with heat exchanger" circulates a water-anti-freeze solution through the
collector plate and back to the heat exchanger.  The potable water flows in a separate piping
system from the hot water tank to the heat exchanger and returns.  There is some efficiency loss
through the heat exchanger.  The cost of this system generally runs higher than the drain-down
system because of the added components and reduced efficiency.<p>

<p>

	Both systems are marketed for the do-it-yourself home-owner as a kit.  They are
assembled in a training workshop preparatory to installing as a retrofit to the existing home hot
water system.  During 1981, home-owners built 134 systems in 12 workshops through Utah State
University Extension Service and their local county agents.  These workshops are being continued
in 1982 with assistance from the Utah Energy Office.<p>

<p>

Definitions of terms:<p>

<p>

1.	Absorber-the surface in a collector that absorbs solars radiation and converts it to heat
energy; generally matte black surfaces are good absorbers and emitters of thermal
radiation while white and metallic surfaces are not.<p>

<p>

2.	Active System-a solar heating or cooling system that requires external mechanical power
to move the collected heat.<p>

<p>

3.	Auxiliary Heat-the extra heat provided by a conventional heating system for periods of
cloudiness or intense cold when a solar heating system cannot provide enough.<p>

<p>

4.	Closed loop-any loop in the system which is not exposed to the atmosphere.<p>

<p>

5.	Collector-a device that collects solar radiation and converts it into heat.<p>

<p>

6.	Collector efficiency-the ration of usable heat energy extracted from a collector to the solar
energy striking the cover.<p>

<p>

7.	Flat plate collector-a solar collection device in which sunlight is converted into heat on a
plane surface without the aid of reflecting surfaces to concentrate the rays.<p>

<p>

8.	Heat exchanger-a device such as a coiled copper tube immersed in a tank of water, that is
used to transfer heat from one fluid to another through a separating wall.<p>

<p>

9.	Kilowatt hour (kwh)-the amount of energy equivalent to 1 kilowatt of power being used
for one hour; 3,412 BTU.<p>

<p>

10.	Open loop system-some part of the system is vented to the atmosphere or the system
contains fresh or changeable water.<p>

<p>

11.	Retrofitting-the addition of a solar heating or cooling system to a building.<p>

<dd><font size=5><b>T</b></font>he <b>Utah Clean Fuels Loan Program</b> promotes the transition to cleaner-burning 
transportation fuels to improve Utah's air quality and reduce our reliance on foreign
 oil.  Low-interest loans are available to private businesses and zero-interest loans are 
available to public fleet operators.  The loans are used:  to convert vehicles to use 
cleaner-burning fuels; to purchase vehicles manufactured to operate on cleaner-burning 
fuels; and for purchase and installation of fueling facilities.  Loan repayments are made 
from actual fuel cost savings.  Each loan application is evaluated for cost-effectiveness 
with payback's averaging from three to five years.<br>

<dd><font size=5><b>T</b></font>he <b>Clean Cities Program</b> sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy recognizes public 
and private sector commitments to accelerate the transition to alternative transportation 
fuels to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and improve our air quality.   Petroleum-based 
transportation fuels account for more than 75 percent of Utah's air pollution and oil 
imports account for more than 50 percent of the national trade deficit.  Salt Lake City/Salt 
Lake County and Ogden City/Weber County received a Clean Cities designation in l994.  
Subsequently, Provo City and Jordan School District signed on as partners.  A clean cities 
designation is also essential to successfully compete for federal alternative transportation 
fuels grants.<br>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>1.</b></font>World energy consumption is expected to increase 
40-50% by the year 2010.  Global carbon dioxide emissions would increase 
50-60%.  Average global temperatures could rise by 2.2 degrees F. by 2030.</blockquote>


<blockquote><font size=5><b>2.</b></font> Americans spend over $1,975 per person per year on all energy purchases.  
This represents 7.7% of the U.S. gross domestic product. </blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>3.</b></font>	World-side, the U.S. ranks second in worldwide per-capita energy 
consumption (Canada is first) among the industrialized countries.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>4.</b></font>	The U.S. consumes 17 million barrels of oil per day with 66% used for 
transportation. For the first six months of 1996, 53 percent of the oil was imported.  There
 are 195 million vehicles operating in the U.S. </blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>5.</b></font>	An improvement of 1 percent in industrial efficiency would save $1.0 
billion per year nationally or $8 million in savings for Utah's commercial and industrial users.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>6.</b></font>	The U.S. has 5% of the world population, but contributes 25% to the 
carbon dioxide emissions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>7.</b></font>	Energy efficiency activities from 1973-1996 reduced the growth in 
U.S. energy use by 30%.  Primary energy demand could be reduced by another 50% by vigorous programs for 
efficiency (saving $2.3 trillion and reducing carbon emissions by 70%).</blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>8.</b></font>	Thirty-seven percent of the energy used in the U.S. is used to produce
 electricity and 70% of this energy is lost in production and distribution.  Without 
conservation, $100-200 billion in new capital will be needed to meet the nation's 
growth in electricity needs.  For Utah 94.8% of the energy used for electrical generation
 comes from coal.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>9.</b></font>	Buildings in the U.S. consume 36% of the nations annual energy use.  
Exemplary buildings can use cost 50% less to operate for only a 1% increase in 
construction costs.  The FEMP program for federal buildings is expected to save 
$1.0 billion per year by 2000 for a 30% reduction over 1985 usage. </blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=5><b>10.</b></font> Lighting accounts for 25% of all energy consumed in the U.S. or $44.25
 billion annually.</blockquote>

This is the test.
<FONT size=5><B>T</B></FONT>his program originated from the 
excitement that every kid felt when the teacher announced, 
"We are going to go on a fieldtrip!". This program takes a pupil through
 a short tutorial. The student then goes to a classroom where he is
 required to pick four different lessons about electricity before he 
can go on the fieldtrip. The lessons include an animation that 
explains where electricity emerges from. The animation involves 
electrons passing from atom to atom and then through a wire. 
Another animation is utilized to show how a generator works. 
It starts from a turbine and ends with the magnet passing through 
coils and producing electricity. The third lesson shows the path of
 how electricity reaches their home from where it was generated. 
The last lesson gives the kids a break by employing a video segment 
showing how important electricity is, this segment ends with a short 
suggestion of conservation.After the four lessons are completed a 
button labeled fieldtrip appears, they may select the button 
to start their fieldtrip. This button leads to a screen that has 
five different energy sources displayed. This is where they will 
choose which fieldtrip they will go on. Once a button is selected 
it darkens to show that they have gone there. The selection of 
one of these buttons leads to a video of a bus leaving. This lets 
them know they are off on their fieldtrip. It is also in this screen 
that they have the option to exit the program. Each fieldtrip takes 
the student on a tour where they learn more about their selected 
energy source.

<dd>The Utah Commercial/Industrial EE Program partners with Utah business to
develop and demonstrate energy efficient technologies.  In addition to providing
information about federal funding programs, assisting in the review and writing of
proposals, the Office will usually commit up to $40,000 to any successful project or 10
percent of project costs, which ever is less.  Our office assisted Covol Technologies of Lehi to recive a $425,000 grant through the NICE<sup>3</sup> program.  Numerous Utah researchers/companies have received funds through the SBIR/STTR programs to develop new technologies.

</CENTER>
<font size=6 color=#004000 ><b>W</b></font><font color=#004000 >elcome to our new home, the latest, most advanced "green" building in Utah.  By simply walking through our new facility, you can sense its special demensions -- its transparency and openness; the creative use of simple building materials and the intent to develop the structure in an environmentally sensitive manner:<br><br>
As a green building, our new headquarters is designed to blend in with its surround environment and provide a clean, healthy work area that promotes the most effective use of people's time and energy.<br><br>
The building is also energy-efficient and constructed with recycled and reusable materials -- all in keeping with our commitment to help manage the country's remaining natural resources in order to protect our most valuable resource -- <i>future generations.</i></font><br><dd>-- Alan S. Layton<br>

<table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>The Structure</font></td><td>
The open, creative use of concrete and glass gives Layton Construction's new headquarters an outdoors look and feel, appropriate to the construction business.  the vaulted ceiling and glass walls literally "bring the outside in," replicating the exterior surroundings of a construction site.  By together, we were able to use less concrete and reinforced steel in its construction.  All reinforcing steel is recycled from salvaged automobiles and other scrap metals.</td></tr></table><table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>The roof's frame is made from "manufactured" wood I-joists which consist primarily of waste products.  By using manufactured materials, we used 35% fewer board feet of wood compared to traditional construction methods.  A ZincAlume roofing system reflects 95% of the sun's ultraviolet rays, significantly reducing interior temperature -- and air conditioning bills -- during the summer.</td><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>The Roof</font></td></tr></table><table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>Glass Glazing System</font></td><td>All exterior insulated and tinted -- to reduce glare -- and glazed with a "Low E" coating that reflects 95% of the sun's heat, while permitting light to enter:  The aluminum window mullions and frames are made of recycled aluminum material and have a full thermal -- break.</td></table><table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>Because the building allows the highest levels of natural light to illuminate interior spaces, electrical energy required to illuminate interior spaces, electrical energy required to illuminate the building is reduced by 40%.  Further energy savings of up to 50% (compared to conventional lighting systems) are obtained through the use of high-efficiency electronic ballasts.</td><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>Natural Light</font></td></tr></table>

During the winter, energy savings are obtained from the recovery and reuse of heat generated by the office lights, personal computers and even body heat.</td></tr></table><table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>The interior furnishings and partition systems are designed to increase the comfort and productivity of our emplyees.  The low, 57" partitions allow abundant natural light to enter each work area, yet ensure comfort and privacy.  Furnishings throughout the facility consist of 80% recycled waste materials.</td><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>Furnishings</font></td></tr></table><table width=600 border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td BGCOLOR=#004000><font color=#ffffff size=5>Doors and Woodwork</font></td><td>The cores of the natural cherry wood office doors are made from a composite wood misture, and the veneers were selected from trees grown on private plantations specifically for veneer production.

<b>Contact an engineer.</b>  Obtain a list of qualified<br>
independent engineers from the Utah Office of<br>
Energy Services.  The engineer will determine baseline<br>
consumption for each of your facilities and assess<br>
overall energy savings potential.  Some institutions<br>
prefer to complete a full technical energy audit by the<br>
independent consulting engineer for each building as<br>
a preliminary step to procuring an ESCO.<p>

<b>Obtain a sample Request for Proposal</b> from the Utah<br>
Division of Purchasing or the Office of Energy Services.<br>
With the help of your engineer, distribute the completed<br>
RFP to the ESCOs listed in this brochure.  These<br>
companies have registered through the Utah Division of<br>
Purchasing and provide one-stop service that includes<br>
equipment and building retrofit, project financing<br>
and consumption monitoring of the guaranteed savings<br>
to be achieved.<p>

<b>Review the bids</b> with the help of your independent<br>
engineer and make a selection most advantageous to<br>
your institution.<p>

<b>Negotiate a contract</b> with the ESCO.<p>

<b>Conduct site inspections.</b>  Your independent engineer<br>
should complete at least one on-site inspection during<br>
construction.  When the project is completed, the<br>
engineer should conduct a final inspection to review and<br>
accept the work.<p>

<b>Verify the energy savings.</b>  Your independent engineer<br>
should regularly measure the savings guaranteed by the<br>
ESCO and authorize payments to the financier arranged<br>
through the ESCO.<p>

A  to fund energy efficiency measures in<br>
Utah's public and private buildings is increasingly scarce.<br><br>

It is possible to competitively select a professional<br>
energy service company (ESCO) to provide capital for<br>
energy efficiency improvements on a guaranteed basis.<br>
Under such an arrangement, the ESCO provides<br>
expertise and financing to install energy efficiency<br>
measures and guarantees the energy savings will exceed<br>
the financing payments.  Repayment terms can range<br>
between two and ten years.<br><p>

 <dd>       The Utah Commercial/industrial Energy Efficiency Program assists the U.S.
 Environmental Agency in marketing its voluntary Green Lights Program to Utah
 companies.  The Green Lights Program encourages businesses and government
 agencies to improve energy efficiency and reduce operating costs by installing state-of-
 the-art energy efficient lighting systems.  Reducing energy costs makes businesses
 more competitive, and in the case of government agencies, frees up funds to administer
 public programs.  Green Lights Partners also contribute to a healthier environment.
 Every kilowatt-hour of unused electricity prevents emissions of 1.5 pounds of carbon
 dioxide, 5.8 grams of sulfur dioxide and 2.5 grams of nitrogen oxides.  These pollutants
 contribute significantly to smog and other air quality problems.
 Since the inception of the Green Lights Program in 1991, more than 1,800
 organizations across the country have joined.  For more information about Green Lights Program, <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenlights.html">click here</a>.
 <dd>        Two examples of Utah Green Lights Partners are Inter-mountain Health Care and
 the City of Provo.  IHC is retrofiting lighting systems in its 24 hospitals in Utah and will
 spend $2.5 million, saving $1 million annually.  Provo City cut its electricity use by
 568,000 Kwh and is saving $36,000 per year.
  <dd>       Utah participants include:
Advanced Lighting, Inc., Allen Memorial Hospital, American Lighting Inc., Brigham City
Incorporated, Codale Electric Supply, Inc., First Security Corporation, Hill Air Force Base,
Intermountain Health Care, Lighting Maintenance and Service, Inc., Menlove Dodge Toyota,
Murray City Schools District, Parley Redd Mercantile, Sevier County School District, Seville
Apartments, L.L.C., Team Mechanical Incorporated, The City of North Salt Lake, Utah, The City
of Provo, Utah, The County of Salt Lake, Utah, The Store, Uintah Basin Medical Center, Uintah
County School District, US Bureau of Reclamation, US West, Inc., Utah Army National Guard,
Utah Power, Utah State Hospital, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wasatch County School
District.
  <dd>       The Office of Energy Services holds an annul luncheon to recognize the efforts
 of Green Lights Partners in Utah.  If you are interested in learning more about the
Green Lights Program in Utah
 please contact <a href="mailto:cedomain.cemain.jpalmer@state.ut.us.">James Palmer</a> at (801) 538-8615 or 1-800-662-3633.

simulation game.  This program is for anyone interested in learning
how to save energy while driving a vehicle.  You choose a vehicle,
and you are presented with the task to drive from Logan to St. George.
If you make it to St. George without running out of money you win and 
you can enjoy spring break.  It will be necessary to spend money at 
different cities to repair the random problems that your vehicle has 
and fill your vehicle with gas.  Your vehicle has different problems 
each time you play, making the game different almost every time 
you play.

Energy audits are important management tools.  Energy audits provide an assessment of each building's relative energy efficiency
and a list of priority energy measures.  The Office of Energy Services has included a walk-through energy audit form at this
web site.   This form may be useful to your institution's staff.  Some institutions prefer hiring an independent consulting 
engineer to conduct a full technical energy audit.  Technical audit materials for institutions and their engineers are also included at this site.

<font size=30>W</font>hen properly procured, there should be no risk<br>

<b>Procure competitively -- </b>The Utah Division of<br>
Purchasing and the Utah Office of Energy Services<br>
recommend competitive selection of an ESCO.  A list of<br>
ESCOs operating in Utah appears at the end of this<br>
brochure.  The Division of Purchasing has developed a<br>
generic "Request for Proposal" designed specifically for<br>
procuring an ESCO.  It can be obtained by calling<br>
(801) 538-3709.<p>

<b>Retain independent technical expertise -- </b> Independent<br>
consulting engineers can assist you with ESCO-funded<br>
projects.  Independent engineers inspect the quality of<br>
workmanship and the equipment installed, negotiate<br>
contract changes to achieve highest energy savings,<br>
check compatibility of ESCO-proposed work with<br>
existing building systems and verify the level of energy<br>
savings guaranteed by the ESCO.<p><p>

<center><img src="/images/square.gif"></center><p><p>

<b>NOTE:  Funding assistance for consulting engineers is<br>
available through the Utah Office of Energy Services<br>

The RFP can be adjusted where an institution is using ESCO-based financing to match federal funds (such as DOE's Institutional Conservation Program grants ).  Note: the RFP has been developed with assistance from the State Hospital's independent consulting engineer, Heath Engineering.  The scope of work proposed in the RFP is based upon technical audits completed by Heath Engineering.  <a href="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/facts/hospital.pdf">Click here for this file in .pdf form</a><IMG SRC="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/images\pdf.gif"  align=absmiddle></td></tr>

The Sevier approach involves a 3-step process of detailed RFQ to select two best-qualified ESCOs, walk through audits, oral interview for shortlisted ESCOs, and technical audit and contract negotiation with the successful ESCO.  This document was prepared in June 1994.<IMG SRC="http://energy.aste.usu.edu/images\pdf.gif"  align=absmiddle> This same RFQ was also used in July 1996 for an EXCO procurement by Cache School District.</td></tr>

<b>Utah Students Are "In Concert With The Environment"</b>

<ul><dd><I>SALT LAKE CITY</I> - Eighth and ninth grade science students in Salt Lake, Granite, 

Tooele and Jordan School Districts are becoming "energy managers" in their own 

homes. It's all part of a program called "In Concert With The Environment" that helps 

students become more energy conscious. The program teaches students how their 

energy use impacts the environment and encourages them to adopt energy habits that 

are "In Concert With The Environment."<br> 
<dd>Students are given a comprehensive energy survey and asked to work with family 

members to answer questions about their household energy use. The students check 

such things as how many loads of wash their household does each week, how well 

their house is insulated, whether the family recycles, if family members carpool, and 

how many miles they drive each week. <br>
<dd>When students complete the energy survey, they enter the information into computers 

and a personalized report is produced. The report shows them how well their 

households manage energy and recommends specific things they and their families 

can do to use energy more wisely to be "In Concert With The Environment." Upon 

completion of the program, students receive a certificate signed by their school 

principal. <br>

<dd>The program supports the Utah middle school science curriculum. To date, students at 

Tooele Jr. High, Highland High, Northwest Intermediate, Midvale Middle School, Bryant 

Intermediate Elk Ridge, Intermediate and Bonneville Jr. High have participated in the 

program. "In Concert With The Environment" is sponsored through a partnership 

among Mountain Fuel Supply Company, the Utah Office of Energy Services and the 

Department of Environment Quality. The National Energy Foundation, a developer and 

facilitator of educational programs helps introduce the program to the students.  </ul>

</center>
<p>

Building or buying a new home is the single largest investment most families make during their life time.  Too often
aesthetics and building costs govern how homes are designed and built, and energy efficiency and comfort are low priorities. 
Heating and cooling costs can be a significant part of monthly housing expense and should be calculated into the afford ability
equation along with principle, interest, taxes and insurance.<p>

<p>

<p>

Building an energy efficient home can improve occupant comfort.  Homes with more insulation, better windows, energy-efficient furnaces and smarter energy design result in comfort levels not achieved in standard homes.  Besides lowering
energy bills, efficient homes are less drafty, heating systems cycle less frequently, temperature swings are lower and homes
are quieter and less dusty due to the superior construction.<p>

<p>

<p>

In Utah, all new homes must be built to comply with the 1993 Model Energy Code established by<b> </b>the Council of
American Building Officials.  It is the minimum standard in building new homes but in many cases it is advantageous
and cost-effective to exceed code standards.<p>

<p>

<p>

The Office of Energy Services recommends considering the following features when building a new home:<p>

<p>

<MENU>
<LI>Design roof trusses so R-38 insulation can be installed across the entire ceiling area to the
outside walls.  Many standard trusses don't allow full depth of insulation to the outside walls.  Proper truss
design reduces heat loss and prevents ice-filled rain gutters and destructive ice damming in winter.<p>
</MENU>

<p>
<MENU>
<LI>Install one-inch rigid foam insulation on exterior two-by-four insulated walls to achieve a minimum
R-19 insulation factor.  Exterior foam insulation insulates the entire wall area and not just that 80 percent
where stud cavities are located.  A higher level of insulation can be achieved by>constructing walls with two-by-six studs with R-19 minimum insulation plus exterior foam insulation.  Many homes have R-11 or R-13
wall insulation.  This results in excessive heat loss in the winter and excessive heat gain in the summer.<p>
</MENU>

<p>

<MENU>
<LI>Insulate foundations, rim joists, floors and basement walls as required by the Model Energy Code
to achieve energy saving benefits in both summer and winter.  Up to twenty percent of a home's heat loss
occurs through the basement foundation walls.<p>
</MENU>

<p>

<MENU>
<LI>Install high quality windows.  All metal windows should have a thermal break in both the frame and
the sash.  Vinyl and wood window frames are naturally more energy efficient than aluminum window frames. 
All windows should be 3/4 inch insulated units that have at least a one-half inch airspace between each pane
of glass.  Specify Low-E glass or suspended low-emissivity films between glazings to increase window
efficiency by at least 25 percent.  The addition of argon or other specialty gasses can increase efficiency by
more than 50 percent.  Low-E window films and coatings reduce summer heat gain and filter out destructive
Ultra-Violet rays that fade carpets, draperies and upholstery.<p>
</MENU>
<p>

<MENU>
<LI>		Install a high-efficiency healing system with an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) ratting
of 90 percent or greater.  Air conditioning units with a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating of 12.0
or greater are recommended.  Heat pumps with a Heating System Performance Factor (HSPF) rating of 7.8
or more are also recommended.  Fireplaces and wood stoves should use outside air for combustion.  To avoid
the health and safety problems from back drafting of furnaces and water heaters into living areas, new homes
should have a sealed furnace room with a combustion air vent to the outside.  Furnace and water heaters using
direct vent technology offer an efficient alternative to sealed furnace rooms.<p>
</MENU>
<p>

		<MENU>
<LI>Make sure that heating and cooling ducts are insulated when they run through attics, crawl spaces,
garages, unheated basements and other unconditioned spaces.  All delivery and return ducts should be made
airtight with mastic butyl/foiltape. Building cavities should not be used as delivery or return plenums unless
they contain ducts that can have all joints sealed.<p>
</MENU>

<p>

<MENU>
<LI>A home's orientation can have a tremendous effect on energy bills and on comfort.  A home where
the long axis is east to west should be designed with roof overhangs for window shade in the summer and solar
heat gain in the winter.  This helps prevent the overheating that occurs when south-facing windows are not
shielded from the high summer sun.  A home built where the long axis is 15 degrees plus or minus of true
south WI[ have average energy bills that are 15 percent less than the same house built perpendicular to true
south.<p>
</MENU>
<p>


<Menu>
<LI>		Use the air-tight drywall approach for reducing air infiltration.  The air-tight drywall approach
(ADA) uses the sheetrock surfaces to provide an effective air and moisture barrier to control unwanted
infiltration and moisture transfer.  Several different ADA techniques are available that can eliminate the
traditional plastic vapor barrier by using a vapor barrier primer paint product.<p>
</Menu>
<p>

<menu>
<LI>	Domestic water heaters should include a micro pilot, thermal traps and a temperature setting of
no more than 120' F. Hot water lines in floors and outside walls should be insulated.  Direct vent water
heaters are recommended for efficiency and safety.<p>
</MENU>
<p>

<menu>
<LI>	Request compact fluorescent lighting rather than incandescent.  New compact fluorescent lighting
technology provides more light per watt than incandescent technology with a more natural color of light. 
Fixtures should use T-8 lamps and electronic ballast's.  Airtight recessed can lights should be chosen to allow
for the least ex filtration into ceiling cavities and should use compact fluorescent or low voltage halogen lamps.<p>
</menu>
<p>

<p>

Some lending institutions recognize energy efficient features as an opportunity to increase mortgage loan amounts.  Some
lenders will provide homeowners with an additional $5,000 to $10,000 using an Energy Efficient Mortgage since an energy-efficient home provides enough utility savings to make the additional payments.  For every additional dollar in mortgage
payments arising from the increased costs for energy efficient construction, there is a corresponding decrease in energy bills. 
In other words, in the long term, energy efficiency will<b> </b>not cost anything, because the additional investment is recovered
through a reduction in energy bills.<p>

<p>

<p>

Specific energy-efficient features, construction details, energy code compliance forms and other information resources
can be obtained from the Utah Office of Energy Services by calling (801) 538-8690 or 1 (800) 662-3633.

<title>THREE UTAH SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAVE $3.5 MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY</title>

<CENTER><font size=6><b>Three Utah School  Districts Save $3.5 Million Dollars Through Energy Efficiency</b></center></table>
<hr noshade>
<dd>Alpine, Box Elder and Davis school districts saved nearly $3.5 million the
past year by improving their energy efficiency. Utility reports for the year ending June
1995 show that Davis School District saved over $2 million, Alpine School District
saved $1.1 million and Box Elder School District saved nearly $330,000. Michael
Glenn of the Utah Office of Energy Services attributes the savings to four factors:
1) using state-of-the-art lighting technology and building controls; 2) hiring full-time
energy managers; 3) tracking each building's energy use and advising school
administrators; and 4) making a financial commitment to building maintenance.
Davis School District connected all district buildings to a central energy control
center. Lights, heat, pumps and boilers are all centrally controlled. "Savings at night
and on weekends are tremendous," said Bernell Loveridge. "And, we provide students
with greater comfort during school hours. Our control system also incorporates fire and
security functions, so when there is a nighttime intruder, occupancy sensors turn on
hall and outside lights -- it is a shock to a would-be vandal or thief."
Box Elder School District is in the sixth year of its energy efficiency program.
"Our students, faculty, custodians and principals are all part of our district energy management team," said Jim Batey. "They share in the energy savings at each school,
using the savings for outings and equipment."
<dd>Alpine School District is upgrading its old buildings. "We are also looking to the
future," said Ben Sorensen. "We expect architects and contractors to build our new
schools to meet the new state energy code, with the latest energy-efficient technologies
for lowest energy use. While some items cost a few more dollars, such as electronic
ballasts for fluorescent light fixtures, these measures pay for themselves in two to three
years."
<dd>Other districts are following suit: Jordan School District is phasing its schools
onto a central energy management system to monitor building energy use and
occupant comfort. Both Alta High School and Eastmont Middle School are converting
to efficient lighting that will increase the quantity and quality of light, while saving
$71,000 a year in electricity costs.
<dd>The four school districts are among schools, hospitals and colleges that have
participated in the Utah Office of Energy Services Institutional Conservation Program.
Institutions participating in the program compete for matching funds to complete
engineering design analysis and to install new energy technologies. Awards for 1994-
95 include:<ul>
Box Elder School District $169,690<br>Provo School District 9,631 <br>Tooele Hospital 31,813<br>Allen Memorial Hospital 16,109 <br>Cache School District 193,144 <br>Dixie College 8,721 <br>Utah Development Center 35,935<br>Jordan School District 53,454 <br>Murray School District 64,597 <br>Utah State Hospital 29,965 <br>Salt Lake City School District 34,912 <br>Beaver County Hospital 37,326 <br>Utah Valley Regional Med. Center 50,000 <br>San Juan County Hospital 26,858 <br>Alpine School District 48,949 <br>St. Ann's School 31,405
</ul><dd>Due to federal funding cutback, only funding for technical assistance will be available for 1996. Technical assistance funds can be used to competitively select a professional energy service company (ESCO) to provide capital for energy efficiency improvements on a guaranteed basis. Under such an arrangement, the ESCO provides expertise and financing to install energy efficiency measures and guarantees the energy savings will exceed the financing payments. In 1994-95 the Sevier School District utilized $7,000 in technical assistance funding to leverage $688,000 in private sector financing to upgrade all of its school energy systems. For more information call Michael Glenn at (801) 538-8690 or 1-800-662-3633.

<dd> Do you have an environmental business and an interest in exploring Asian
markets?  If so, your environmental product or service may be useful in addressing
environmental problem in Asia.  The United States-Asia Environmental Partnership
(US-AEP) is engaged in a variety of activities to help US environmental businesses
enter Asian markets.
<dd>       The US-AEP and Council of State Governments have issued a solicitation
entitled US-AEP/CSG State Environmental Initiative.  This matching grant program
provides funding to states in support of international, public-private partnerships to
achieve long-term transfer of state environmental experience, technology, practice,
goods and/or services to Asian countries.  If you are interested in partnering with the
State of Utah in such an initiative contact <a href="mailto:cedomain.cemain.jpalmer@state.ut.us.">James Palmer</a> at 538-8615 or 1-800-662-
3633.
