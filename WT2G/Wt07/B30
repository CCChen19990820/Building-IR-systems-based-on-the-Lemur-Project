<center><h3><a name=aa2>Nicorette gum now OTC; Programs set up with ALA</a></h3></center></a>


April 18, 1996. SmithKline Beecham's Nicorette gum went on sale over-the-counter today. The two-week supply--plus audio tape and stop smoking tips--sells for about $50. 

<p>SmithKline Beecham said the gum is the first FDA-approved smoking cessation device to be sold OTC, and is sold without a prescription in 34 of the 50 countries where it is available. A spokesperson said prescriptions for Nicorette accounted for an astonishing 35% of all prescriptions written in the US.

<p>In an unusual partnership, SmithKline Beecham is working with the American Lung Association in providing a "Counselors on Call" smoking cessation program. The counselors are available April 17 through 26, toll-free at 888-ALA-0805, 8 am to midnight.

<p>The company said it will also sponsor ALA smoking cessation community seminars, in-store counseling, local hotlines and other promotions. Further information may be found on the company's website: http:\\www.nicorette.com.

<p>In related news Friday, April 19, an FDA advisory panel recommended OTC sales of two nicotine transdermal patches, Nicotrol, made by Pharmacia & Upjohn, and Nicoderm, made by Alza Corp and Hoechst AG. A third patch, Habitrol by Ciba-Geigy, is due to be considered for OTC sales soon.

<hr><h2><a name=aa10>INTERNATIONAL</a></h2>

<center><h3><a name=aa11>Zimbabwe Tobacco Tax Furor</a></h3></center></a>

Harare, Zimbabwe. April 19, 1996. The government's plan to ease its economic crisis by imposing a 5% tax on auction sales of tobacco has met stiff opposition from the large tobacco farmers, who say it will damage confidence in Zimbabwe's number one cash export crop. Zimbabwe's auctions open Tuesday  Parliament approved the tax last month, and president Robert Mugabe said it would raise $32 million. Zimbabwe is the world's third largest producer of tobacco, next to the United States and Brazil.

<p>In another tobacco-related development, the president of the Zimbabwe Association of Tobacco Merchants accused Agriculture Minister Denis Norman--one of two white ministers in Mugabe's cabinet--of promoting "white supremacy in areas such as tobacco." The statement was made in a Sunday Mail full page ad placed by several black lobbying groups

<p>The groups also published a directive it said Norman had issued, forcing the Tobacco Merchand Board to issue a license to buy tobacco at the auctions to a previously-rejected white-run business.

<center><h3><a name=aa19>BAT's US Legal Bill: $50M/year</a></h3></center></a>

London, April 25, 1996. Under fierce questioning by a tobacco control group at its annual shareholders meeting, B.A.T Industries Plc chairman Lord Cairns disclosed the company spends US$50-$60 million a year in legal fees fighting 174 health-related lawsuits, most in the US.

<p>BAT's pre-tax profit was up 26% over 1995, and BAT Chief Executive Martin Broughton said tobacco's legal bill paled next to BAT's Insurance business' fees.
"We accept it as a cost of the tobacco business,'' he told Reuters. 

<p>In a speech addressing concerns about nicotine addiction and health hazards from secondhand smoke, Cairns said BAT is "not prepared to cede the case to a highly vocal anti-smoking movement," and would continue to vigorously defend itself from "opportunistic" lawsuits.

<p>The tobacco control group, Action on Smoking and Health, warned litigation costs would rise, and urged shareholders to divest in BAT.

<p>BAT stock was down by 2.3 percent on the London Stock Exchange, trading at 499 pence (US$7.50) a share, according to AP.

<p>BAT's US subsidiary, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., is a defendant in several major pending cases.

<center><h3><a name=aa20>Lorillard Quits NYC for Greensboro, NC</a></h3></center></a>


New York, NY. April 25, 1996. The Tisch family's Lorillard Tobacco Co. is leaving New York City, and taking 100 high-paying executive jobs with it, according to Douglas Feiden of the New York Daily News, who said the move was revealed in an Loews Corp. SEC filing.

<p>Lorillard is a unit of Loews, whose largest shareholders are the Tisch family, which has long been deeply involved in New York's social and financial scene. Lorillard is moving to Greensboro, NC, where its manufacturing site is located.

<center><h3><a name=aa21>Lover Gets Boot; Feds Get Files</a></h3></center></a>
Richmond, VA. April 10, 1996. They met at the Tobacco Company restaurant in Richmond in 1993.

<p>She, Harriet "Hatsy" Heep, a 45-year-old interior designer, answered a personal ad.

<p>He, Ronald A. Tamol, a 59-year-old retired Philip Morris engineer in research and development, who for a time during his tenure from 1963-1992, had worked at the cigarette-shaped Philip Morris Research Center in South Richmond.

<p>They were engaged in December, 1994, and he moved into her Richmond, Virginia home in November of 1995. He called her, "my little addict," she said in a sworn statement, but they had been fighting a lot lately. </p>

<p>The real trouble began when her 21-year-old daughter came to visit, and mentioned that she had quit smoking Marlboros, Philip Morris' top brand.</p>

<p>According to Heep's testimony, Tamol said she was not supposed to be able to do that, and asked if she would meet with Philip Morris researchers.</p>

<p>"Hatsy just went ballistic,'' said Castano case lawyer Wendell Gauthier, who told reporters of Heep's testimony.</p>

<p>"Are you telling me Marlboros are designed so you can't quit ... you addicted her or your company did and now you want to find a method to make sure no one else can quit like she did," Gauthier quoted her as saying.</p>

<p>She quoted Tamol as saying that Philip Morris's strategy was, "Once you got them, we never want to lose them.' That was the theory at R&D: 'Once they're ours, they're ours for life.'"</p>

<p>Shortly after this incident, Tamol moved out, taking with him most of 70 boxes and trash bags of documents he had stored in her basement.</p>

<p>Apparently, there was a dispute about the remaining 8 boxes. Heep told the Castano lawyers that Tamol urged her to destroy them, and that agents of Philip Morris came by looking for them. "If you expect to keep wearing $200 pumps you'd better cooperate," Tamol told her.</p>

<p>But, said Ms. Heep, "I'm not stupid and I'm not a Philip Morris wife who is terrified that my next meal and my pretty pumps are not going to be paid for."</p>

<p>After one altercation, Heep dialed 911; the police helped Tamol remove more documents, according to Heep.

<p>"I progressively came to realize the significance and importance of the documents," she said. "I didn't feel I could be a part of the destruction of these things"</p>

<p>So, last week, having watched the proceedings of the addiction-based Castano case on Tuesday, she turned them over to the lawyers, who on Friday turned them over to the FBI.</p>

<p>On Saturday, both Heep and Tamol were interviewed by the FBI for the Justice Department, which is investigating the tobacco industry on a number of issues, including whether Philip Morris executives knew nicotine was addictive. Heep's statement ran to 63 pages; Tamol reportedly told the FBI, "Philip Morris is not manipulating nicotine."</p>

<p>On Monday night and Tuesday, the FBI served four subpoenas for documents to  Heep, Tamol, Tamol's son, and retired PM research director Dr. Thomas I. Osdene, who also was mentioned in the Uydess testimony.</p>

<p>Also on Tuesday, news of the tabloid-style development hit ABC World News Tonight, and NBC-TV.</p>

<p>THE DOCUMENTS</p>

<p>The documents, about 10,000 pages, date from 1962-1992, and "are handwritten notes, original, unaltered, unadulterated notes" of Tamol, as well as internal Philip Morris memos, according to Castano lawyers.</p>

<p>Reporters have noted that one document, stamped R.A. Tamol, in a characteristic Philip Morris style, and dated Feb. 1, 1995, contained the handwritten phrase, "determine minimum nicotine drop to keep normal smokers `hooked.'"</p>

<p>Another, dated 1989 and issued to ``R. Tamol," has a warning: "If the report has served its purpose and is no longer needed, please return it to the central file at the research center for recordkeeping and destruction.''</p>

<p>REACTION</p>

<p>"I swear on my mother's grave," Tamol has told reporters, "These things are absurd.... I'm probably going to sue her for all this false information that she's passed along."</p>

<p>Tamol has said the documents were his own, not Philip Morris'--"old notes from the '60s ... and if they're there, they're just my own scribblings, nothing to do with Philip Morris." He said they were kept for things he wanted to deal with in the future in his independent consulting business. "Anything I would have had for Philip Morris, I would have thrown out.'' </p>

<p>Philip Morris has said that despite repeated requests, it has been unable to see the documents. "We cannot at this time even verify whether these documents are authentic, and we cannot address the outrageous and desperate characterization of the purported documents by the plaintiffs' lawyers," the company said, adding, "this may be the most bizarre stunt [the Castano lawyers] have pulled to date. This is part of an all too familiar pattern of documents being leaked to the media." </p>

<p>Tobacco stories have been under-represented in a number of news venues. Perhaps with this development--now that Tonya Harding and O.J. Simpson are only sporadically newsworthy--we'll see more tobacco items in the National Star as well as on Ted Koppel's Nightline.</p>

<center><h3><a name=aa22>Double-digit Earnings for PM, RJR?</a></h3></center></a>
4/11/96. Financial analysts estimate that PHILIP MORRIS AND RJR, despite Big Tobacco's most intense legal, federal and social pressure ever, are heading for double-digit earnings growth for the first quarter. Sales are strong nationally and booming abroad.

<center><h3><a name=aa23>Hatsy in the News</a></h3></center></a>
4/11/96. The AP reported a detailed precis of HATSY HEEP'S financial entanglements, while the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Heep made a sworn statement that Philip Morris lawyers "demanded that everything [presumably the Tamol documents in her basement] be removed and be destroyed." 

<hr><h2><a name=aa24>LAWSUITS</a></h2>

<center><h3><a name=aa25>Industry Must Disclose Gov't Contacts--Judge</a></h3></center></a>

Jackson, Miss. April 18, 1996  A state judge today ordered tobacco defendants to disclose any and all contacts between industry representatives and state employees or officials--elected or appointed--which may have concerned Mississippi's ongoing "Medicaid" case. Judge William H. Myers also ordered disclosure of the names of those involved, along with the nature of the contacts. He also ordered disclosure of the names of those state employees who have received contributions or gifts of any value from the industry.

<p>Most of the requirements of the order date from December 31, 1989 to the present.

<p>Myers's order stems froma request by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore seeking information about the defendants' possible efforts to obstruct the suit through political means.

<p>While the defendants have argued such disclosure would violate First Amendment rights to petition the government, Steve Bozeman, a lawyer for Mississippi, said those rights do not include the ``right to petition our government in secret.''

<p>In another decision, according to a Philip Morris press release, the judge allowed the tobacco companies to take depositions from 20 individual welfare recipients who say they were injured by smoking.

<p>The State of Mississippi v. American Tobacco et. al., was filed on May 23, 1994, in the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Mississippi (Cause No. 94-1429).

<center><h3><a name=aa26>Justice Dept. Wins Delay in Healthy Buildings Case</a></h3></center></a>

Washington, DC. April 18, 1996. The judge in a civil fraud case against tobacco industry associate Healthy Buildings International has ordered a 6 month delay after the Justice Department argued the case would conflict with its grand jury investigation into the tobacco industry and its affiliates, which is being heard in nearby Alexandria, VA.

<p>The fraud suit was filed by a former employee, who alleges HBI, which grew from a tiny consulting business to an international leader while receiving massive funding from tobacco companies, was "virtually a front" for the industry, and rigged tests so as to diminish the role of secondhand smoke in indoor air pollution. Justice is investigating because of Congressional subcommitte testimony that some Congressmen felt revealed "a widespread pattern of significant data alteration" in reports HBI submitted to various government agencies, including the EPA.

<p>HBI's lawyer argued against U.S. District Judge William B. Bryant's order, saying the delay would subject the company to "face the certainty of a slow death by rumor."

<center><h3><a name=aa31>2 1/2 Years for Airline Smoking</a></h3></center></a>

Alexandria, VA. 4/21/96 A British man was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for fighting with crew and pilots after trying to smoke in the bathroom on a United Airlines flight from London to Dulles International. A fight broke out between bricklayer Jantzen Shaun Coles, 25, and flight personnel and passengers when they tried to extricate him from the bathroom. Coles pled guilty to three counts of interfering with a flight crew. "U.S. officials said Coles' criminal record in Britain showed six adult convictions for crimes ranging from theft to burglary," according to UPI.

<center><h3><a name=aa32>Regine Free on $100,000 Bond, Blasts US over Airline Smoking Row</a></h3></center></a>

Boston, MA: April 21, 1996. French nightclub owner Regine Choukroun, 66, blasted US police after a row over smoking in a nonsmoking section led to her and her son's arrest on charges of assaulting and interfering with a flight crew.

"There was an argument, that's all. Does smoking one cigarette in a no-smoking compartment deserve such a violation of human rights as taking people to prison, handcuffing them, giving them a body search?'' Choukroun told French-Info Radio. "It's a disgrace.. We are talking about significant moral and psychological damage here."

<p>The attendants claim that her son, Lionel Rotcajg, 47, went "berserk" when told he couldn't smoke, pushed one attendant and threatened to shoot another.

<p>The American Airlines Paris to Miami flight was diverted to Boston, where the FBI arrested Choukroun and Rotcajg, who claim the incident was the result of cultural and language differences, and was blown out of proportion. They were freed on $100,000 bond.

<p>Choukroun is the owner of "Regine's" nightclubs in Paris, New York and Brazil, and has written a book on addiction. She received the Legion of Honor from President Jacques Chirac a few weeks ago. Rotcajg was an editor of the French version of Rolling Stone. They had been traveling with Rotcajg's 7 year old daughter to "get away from it all" after the death of her mother from cancer a few months ago. The family had been unable to get seats in the smoking section..

<p>Starting June 1, 1996, American will ban smoking completely on all its flights to and from Europe and the Carribbean while keeping some smoking flights between the US and Latin America and Japan. Also on June 1, USAir will ban smoking on all its flights.

<center><h3><a name=aa27><i>Ashes to Ashes</i> Reviewed</a></h3></center></a>
<li>4/12/96. "ASHES TO ASHES," Richar Kluger's massive tobacco industry history received a lukewarm review in the Wall St. Journal

<li>4/15/96. "ASHES TO ASHES" received a postitive review from Christopher Lehman-Haupt in the New York Times: <i>What is perhaps most disturbing about reading this minutely detailed volume - at least to someone who smoked his way through three decades of Kluger's 100-year history - is to learn how completely manipulated one was. Not only is ``Ashes to Ashes'' another report of the banality of evil, it is also an exercise in horrifying nostalgia.</i>

CBS-TV's "48 HOURS," April 10, 1996, featured a segment on Dennis Parone's "CANNABIS BUYER'S CLUB" in San Francisco. One shot focused on a handwritten sign hanging above the sales counter: 

<P>Thank you for POT smoking.
<BR>PLEASE do NOT smoke tobacco here.

<center><h3><a name=aa1>DOLE: "Just Cut Out the Advertising"</a></h3></a></center></h3>


New York, NY July 5, 1996. Little noticed by most during Wednesday's Katie Couric interview was presidential contender Bob Dole's suggestion to "[j}ust cut out the advertising" of cigarettes.

<p>The statement's implications may have been lost on reporters already shocked by Dole's suggestions that Couric may be violating FCC rules by "advertising" Democratic positions, or that conservative ex-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop may have been "a little bit" brainwashed by the liberal media. The idea of banning all cigarette advertising, coming from a government-hands-off politician, may well have been an unfortunate misstatement, as such a sweeping proposal seems to go far beyond anything the FDA or President Clinton has yet suggested.

<p>In full, Dole said to Couric on a segment of NBC's "Today" which had been taped Sunday but aired Wednesday morning:

<blockquote>Cigarettes aren't good for you. I voted for tougher smoking laws as far as giving it back to the states. States ought to handle it. I don't have any quarrel with it. Just cut out the advertising, do all the other things. But it is legal.</blockquote>

<p>It was unclear what Dole was referring to when he said, "do all the other things."

<p>The Washington, DC-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids immediately issued a press release which states that the organization 

<blockquote>...applauds Sen. Dole's groundbreaking statement yesterday endorsing a ban on tobacco advertising . . . [H]is statement makes clear that he recognizes that tobacco advertising increases the use of tobacco products by young people. . .

<p>While some people are saying that we should trust the tobacco industry to regulate their own advertising, we agree with Sen. Dole that it is better to "just cut out the advertising.</blockquote>

<center><h3><a name=aa2>Teens to Protest Ticketmaster/Joe Camel Promotion</a></h3></center></a>

Seattle, WA. May 2, 1996. Teen tobacco-control groups today announced that on Saturday they will protest Ticketmaster's participation in RJ Reynolds' Joe Camel "Rockin' Road Trip." The "Road Trip" is a promotional campaign in which Ticketmaster offers gift certificates to rock concerts for "Camel Cash," coupons obtainable from Camel cigarette packs

<p>The teens' protest will start at 1PM on Pine St., outside the Westlake Center Ticketmaster outlet in downtown Seattle. Participating groups include REACT, SMOOTH and ALERT.

<center><h3><a name=aa3>CA: Pols to Guide Scientific Research</a></h3></a></center></h3>

Sacramento, CA. July 3, 1996. The tortured history California's Proposition 99 (1988) cigarette tax funds--which at one time found the California Medical Association fighting side-by-side with tobacco interests and Governor Pete Wilson to redirect them--took another bizarre turn today. State budget negotiators have agreed to allow political appointees to approve or disapprove research funded with the $60 million the tax brings in for tobacco research and education.

<p>HOW THE POLITICAL REVIEW WOULD WORK

<p>The University of California, which has previously overseen the funds and assigned research based on a peer-review process, would prepare a spending plan for the Department of Finance. A governor-appointed Tobacco Education Research Oversight Committee would then conduct public hearings and make recommendations.

<p>The budget provision was backed by new Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who last week attached another provision specifically forbidding the state Department of Health Services's TV ads from attacking the tobacco industry.

<p>According to a UC study, Pringle has received $25,250 in tobacco contributions since 1993. A spokesperson said Pringle was "philosophically opposed to using taxpayer dollars to attack any industry."

<p>REACTION

<p>The research community was in an uproar, partly because UC said they would accept the plan. A UC spokesperson said he saw no major change in how UC approved research, and that he could understand how the state would want to keep close tabs on the allocation of so much money.

<p>One UC researcher could be particularly hard-hit by the provision: Dr. Stanton Glantz, a scientist whose research has often rebutted industry claims, and who is considered by many to be the tobacco industry's worst enemy. Glantz was the target of a federal-level scientific de-funding effort last year. "But this goes way beyond me," he said. "This is an outrageous intrusion into the scientific and academic process. I cannot imagine a clearer intrusion into the academic freedom of a university."

<center><h3><a name=aa4>MA: Bill Would require Disclosure of "The List"</a></h3></a></center></h3>

July 26, 1996. Boston, MA. Gov. Weld has said he will sign an unprecedented bill which would require cigarette manufacturers to reveal the "recipes"--added ingredients and their amounts--of each brand of cigarette. The result of the bill, passed by the Senate 39-0 last Thursday (7/25/96), may be public disclosure of "The List" of cigarette additives for the first time in history.

<p>Though manufacturers revealed their additives to the government in 1994, they were allowed to present a compiled list of 599--with no brands or amounts specified. In addition, the list was kept secret from the public.

<p>The Tolman bill (Sen. Warren Tolman, D-Waterford is chief sponsor) would require manufacturers to present their information to the Mass. Department of Public Health, which could then release the list to the public.

<p><i>Every food and every drug has to list its ingredients and tobacco products will now be held to the same standard,</i> Tolman said.

<center><h3><a name=aa5>MA: Weld Signs Tobacco Ingredient Disclosure Law</a></h3></a></center></h3>

Boston, MA. August 2, 1996. Gov. Weld signed the <a href="http://www.jointogether.org/news/jto/Show_News.qry?News_uid=8392">Tolman bill</a> at a news conference. The law will take effect in 3 months. Meanwhile, even as the conference was being held, tobacco companies were filing suit to overturn the law, charging that federal labeling regulations preempt state provisions, and that the  law would force them to disclose trade secrets.

<center><h3><a name=aa6>ENGLAND: BAT Chief Wins Cambridge Chair Fight</a></h3></a></center></h3>

After a 6-month ethical brouhaha, Cambridge University's parliamentary body approved by a 2-1 margin (1,128 to 583) a L1.6 million donation by tobacco giant BAT Industries Plc. Accompanying the donation is a chair in international relations named for BAT's former chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy.

<p>Approached by the press as a battle between idealists and pragmatists, the furor--which pitted academic titans against each other--was sparked by Cambridge's creation of a Sir Patrick Sheehy Chair in international relations last February. Opponents--including the University's senior medical academic, <p>Sir Keith Peters--objected to accepting money from, and honoring the chairman of, a tobacco company.

<p>Oxford recently set up an ethics committee to screen donations. Cambridge, instead, sent out a postal ballot to 3,300 dons and senior administrators.

<p>In defense of the donation, Sir Roger Tomkys, master of Pembroke College, said, <i>I respect the ethical hesitations by some senior members of the university but this new chair will not sell a single cigarette. . . If you examine the business morality of every commercial organization, there is no clean money out there. You can't take money from the arms trade, from the pharmaceutical industry because of animal experiments, or from the banks because of their Third World policies.</i>

<p>Some of the arguments that were made against the donation: 

<blockquote><p><li><i>Cambridge University has sold its good name to a company which profits from sales of a lethal and highly-addictive product. The university will inevitably be used by BAT to promote tobacco in its developing world markets.</i>--Pamela Furness, chief executive of ASH

<p><li><i>We wouldn't accept money from Saddam Hussein to set up a chair in Arabic studies.</i>--Professor Nick Davies, director of the Institute of Public Health

<p><li><i>BAT kill half their regular customers so they have to spend a lot of money buying goodwill.</i> --Professor Richard Peto, Imperial Cancer Research Fund.</blockquote>

<p>A spokesperson for BAT said, <i>The idea that we are trying to buy respectability is laughable. We are one of the UK's top 10 companies.</i>

<p>BAT is the second-largest cigarette manufacturer in the world behind Philip Morris, and is the UK manufacturer of Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Lucky Strike brands.

<p>Sheehy was banned from the US this week in a separate matter involving Sherritt International, a Canadian mining company the State Department said had confiscated US property in Cuba. Under a new controversial US law meant to punish abuses in Cuba, Sheehy and several other directors have been notified they are banned from the US.

<center><h3><a name=aa10>Maxwell to Chair WPP?</a></h3></a></center></h3>

London, England. July 15, 1996. Hamish Maxwell, who steered Philip Morris' expanding fortunes in the 1980s, is expected to take over as Chairman of <a href="http://www.hillandknowlton.com/public/wpp.htm "> WPP Group PLC,</a> the world's largest advertising and marketing group, according to the Times of London.

<p>WPP owns giant advertising agencies Ogilvy & Mather and J. Walter Thompson and one-time tobacco PR firm Hill and Knowlton.

<p>Maxwell oversaw PM's expansion into international markets, and its acquisition of General Foods and Kraft, creating one of the world's giant conglomerates. He is still chairman of PM's powerful executive committee, 

<center><h3><a name=aa7>FRANCE: PM "Milk" Ad Banned</a></h3></a></center>

Paris, France. June 27, 1996 A French court, ruling on a case brought by 77 cookie and cracker manufacturers, banned Philip Morris's ad campaign which implied that second-hand smoke was less dangerous than milk or biscuits. The court could fine PM US$200,000 for each infraction of France's advertising regulations.

<p>A "shocked and surprised" Philip Morris said it would immediately appeal the decision, but that the campaign's purpose--its third major effort to hold back EU tobacco control legislation--had been served. "We feel that we have got our message out."

<p>The court banned the ads because:
--advertising of tobacco products is illegal --comparative advertising is illegal
--advertising of tobacco products is "very harmful" (an echo of the phraseology of France's required health warnings) to the interests of biscuit makers

<p>"You don't need to use cookies to sell tobacco," said the lawyer for the cookie makers, but a European PM spokesperson said, "We're comparing scientific studies, not products."

<p>The company said, "The biscuit industry . . ., should not be trying . . . to suppress public awareness and discussion -- they should be joining with us in the effort to make the public aware of the dangers of misinterpretation of scientific studies."

<p>The print ad campaign was launched June 9 in European Union countries. The campaign cites certain studies to indicate that second hand smoke risks are less than the risks of drinking milk or chlorinated water, eating a biscuit a day, or peppering one's food. Tobacco control advocates and some European officials claim the ads are misleading, and do not address the risks of respiratory diseases and infections in children.

<p>A suit brought by Belgian biscuit makers who hold "the ads are defaming" was denied last Friday, but the suit will return to the courts this week. Italy and Holland are also looking into advertising code violations.

<center><h3><a name=aa8>ROMANIA: Cig Prices Skyrocket After Anti-smuggling Measures</a></h3></a></center>

Bucharest, Romania. May 8, 1996. Cigarette prices in Romania have increased 40% on the heels of the government's new anti-smuggling drive.

<p>Arrests of smuggling kingpins--one was alleged to be responsible for fully 1/5 of all cigarettes consumed in this heavy-smoking nation--and the institution of a new tax stamp program on May 1 have led to a severe cigarette shortage.

<p>Much of the problem has to do with delays in supplying foreign vendors with the stamps which verify origin and certify that customs fees--up to 300%--have been paid. The stamps are pink for local brands, green for imported.

<p>American brands have all but disappeared from retailers' shelves, but can be found later at night, stampless, at up to 3 times their normal prices.

<p>Romania has been known for having extremely low cigarette prices. Current prices for a pack of US or UK cigarettes range from US$1-$2. The average weekly salary in Romania is US$25.

<p>One third of adult Romanians smoke, and the country is Eastern Europes 2nd largest consumer of cigarettes behind Poland.

<center><h3><a name=aa9>ROMANIA: RJR Gives Health Warnings</a></h3></a></center>

Bucharest, Romania. June 11, 1996. RJR has voluntarily begun slapping its own health warnings on packs of its Romanian-produced brands--even though such warnings are not required by the government, according to Reuters.

<p>"Giving up smoking now considerably reduces the risk to your health" read the warnings, which are located on the side of brands produced in RJR's Bucharest factory, and are "tiny," Reuters says.

<p>Gerard Cayla, RJR general manager for Romania told Reuters, "We have been the first to put them on, as a token of respect for Romanian consumers."

<p>Romania has few restrictions on advertising and sale of cigarettes, but lately the cigarette market has been affecting national concerns in other ways.

<p>The government recently issued a tax stamp system to control rampant smuggling, but snafus led to a severe shortage of smuggled foreign cigarettes, and skyrocketing prices for local brands. 

<p>In fact, the ruling Social Democrats party blamed its recent heavy losses in a recent round of elections on cigarette price-gouging by retailers. The government responded by immediately instituting a price ceiling for cigarettes--at about half the going street prices--and hopes to do better in the next round of local elections this Sunday.

<p>"The Romanian Tobacco Authority will set retail prices . . . to eliminate the incorrect behavior of some traders ahead of the elections," said an official.

<center><h3><a name=aa11>POLAND: New Smoking Restrictions Take Effect</a></h3></center></a>

Warsaw, Poland. May 1, 1996. Poland's sweeping new smoking restrictions went into effect today. Smoking is now allowed only in designated smoking areas in many public places, including workplaces, hospitals, schools, and sports centers.

<p>Tobacco advertising is no longer allowed on TV and radio, in cinemas, youth and children's publications, hospitals, schools and sports centers or events. The sale of single cigarettes in vending machines or to those under 18 is now against the law.

<p>The bill authorizing the restrictions had once contained a total advertising ban, but the provision was considered harmful to publishers and to Poland's own plans to privatize the industry.

<p>The loosened advertising restrictions led Premier Lech Walesa to try to veto the bill last December, just before he left office. "The ambitious goal of the bill will not be reached if even a limited possibility of advertising tobacco remains," he said.

<center><h3><a name=aa12>PHILIPPINES: Supreme Court Lets Tan Off Tax Charges</a></h3></a></center>

Manila, The Philippines. June 4, 1996

<p>Amid charges that judges were "very lavishly bribed," the Supreme Court ruled the government had improperly prosecuted beer and tobacco magnate Lucio Tan and 67 officers of Fortune Tobacco Company for tax evasion.

<p>The decision deeply displeased president Fidel Ramos, who has been working towards tax reform.

<p>The charges against the three judges were made in a public letter from an unauthenticated group called "Crusade Against Corruption in the Supreme Court," and shook the country. In a rare statement, the Supreme Court condemned the  'poison pen letter' and its "cowardly and devious author." The statement called the charges "extremely vicious, scurrilous, false and malicious, libelous, unfair, baseless, mere `matters of guesswork,' the product of a malevolent mind. . . The Court declares its full support of and continuing confidence in these three members." Even government prosecutors excoriated the letter.

<p>Within days of the letter's release, the 3 accused judges--Santiago Kapunan, Josue Bellosillo and Regino Hermosisima--ruled for Tan in a 3-2 decision; in the decision, one judge called the government's task force, which had been set up to prosecute Tan, a "dictatorial technique."

<p>One of the dissenting judges wrote an unusually harsh critique. "I will have no part in the shocking process, especially in light of the fact that the government cries out that the people have been cheated and defrauded of their taxes to the tune of allegedly 25.6 billion pesos, and yet it is not given by this court even a beggar's chance to prove it," wrote Teodoro Padilla.

<p>The decision severely cripples the government's tax-reform and anti-corruption drive, which could threaten the country's recent economic gains.

<p>Tan, a Chinese immigrant who first worked as a janitor, is one of the richest men in the Philippines, worth an estimated $7 billion. Besides Fortune Tobacco, he owns Asia Brewery, and controls Philippine Airlines.

<center><h3><a name=aa13>ZIMBABWE: Tobacco Exports Threatened by Child Labor Protest</a></h3></a></center>

Harare, Zimbabwe. May 16, 1996. "A major importer of our tobacco has threatened to stop dealing with us because of the issue of child labor on our farms,"  a senior government official told COMTEX today.

<p>At issue are child labor provisions among 176 labor-oriented basic human rights conventions, which the International Labour Organisation is requesting countries to ratify. Zimbabwe has ratified 6.

<p>The ILO defines child labor as denying a child education, or assigning labor that interferes with the child's basic development. An ILO official told COMTEX the organization was lenient with developing countries, but that the child labor issue "is very important to us."

<p>The official told COMTEX that farmers do provide schooling for children, who are often in the fields to "supplement family incomes." The lack of ratification could affect all Zimbabwe exports, but tobacco could hurt the country most.

<p>Zimbabwe is the world's third largest producer of flue-cured tobacco, next to Brazil and the United States. Tobacco is one of Zimbabwe's major exports, accounting for about 30 percent of total export earnings. It is also the single largest foreign currency earner, and is expected to bring in $700 million this year.

<p>50% of Zimbabwean tobacco is exported to the European Union, 20% to the Far East, and 10% to the United States.

<center><h3><a name=aa14>ZIMBABWE: 10% Tobacco Levy Passed</a></h3></a></center>

Harare, Zimbabwe. May 30, 1996. The Zimbabwe Parliament today approved a 10% tobacco levy, to be divided equally between growers and merchants.

<p>The unexpectedly high levy was pushed through by amendments to a less burdensome proposal by President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. Mugabe is expected to sign the bill.</p>

<p>The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association said the levy represented a double taxation, and could undermine Zimbabwe's position as the world's third largest tobacco producer behind the United States and Brazil. </p>

<p>Zimbabwe has had tough tobacco sales for the last 9 years, due to bad rains and some worldwide tobacco gluts.</p>

<p>This year, because of good rains during Zimbabwe's growing season (Nov. to March), tobacco is expected to bring in US$700 million, over three times the income of previous years. The levy would cost the industry some US$61.1 million.</p>

<p>The levy was also criticized as being especially harmful to black tobacco farmers, who generally own smaller farms.</p>

Montvale, NJ. July 11, 1996. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company announced today that it would remove all cigarette vending machines from its supermarkets by the end of July.

<p>A&P chairman and chief executive officer James Wood said, "We are in full support of President Clinton's effort to reduce the use of tobacco among young people."

<p>The 1,000-store chain also has instituted an age identification training videotape for cashiers, a lock-out software program that makes it impossible for tobacco products to be scanned at checkout counters without confirmation of the customer's age, and employee compliance checks at all stores.

<center><h3><a name=aa16>Smoking is Good ???</a></h3></a>

<i> by Jeanne Scott (70673.3250@compuserve.com) </i></center>

<p>May 7,1 996. Under the header, "Making a Case for Death," the New York Times this week studied smoking's costs to society, including economic studies that claim to demonstrate the "inconvenient truth ... that smokers cover their own medical costs, not only by paying cigarette taxes ... but also by dying before collecting their full share of health and retirement benefits."

<p>Supporting such an argument at the very least raises several questions, including:  "How do we calculate what smokers cost everybody else?  Should we acknowledge that sometimes death is helpful to the public treasury?  And if that's so, where might such an argument end?"

<p>Two economic studies purport to show that smokers more than pay for the health costs they incur.  A Rand Corp. study conducted by University of Minnesota health economist Willard Manning showed that while smokers have higher health costs and died earlier than nonsmokers, society comes "out ahead" financially when the taxes they pay are figured into the equation.  A second study conducted by Duke University economist W. Kip Viscusi "found that smokers subsidize nonsmokers even without taxes."  After considering the savings in retirement benefits and nursing home costs that result from smokers' earlier deaths, Viscusi concluded that each pack of cigarettes sold in the U.S. results in a five cents "net gain to society."   In particular, he found that smoking provides "big savings" in retirement benefits -- up to $30 billion per year in pension costs are saved because many smokers die at an earlier age and cannot collect all of their benefits.

<p>[Note, this study is criticized because it did not factor in survivor's benefits and the costs to society of families losing a parent and relying more on social services to fill the gap.]

<p>Manhattan Institute for Policy Research Senior Fellow Peter Huber said, "Killing yourself by smoking incurs costs. ... But there are offsets.  It's quite possible that smokers are doing us all a small favor.  It's a ghoulish argument -- it's horrible -- but if you're going to have an economic case, you've got to use economics.  You can't use sentiment."

<p>Congressional Research Service economists Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman write that "the alternative to death from a smoking-related illness is not immortality and perfect health -- it is later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness."

<p>The Manning and Viscusi findings have their critics, many of whom cite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that show smoking's costs to be "several times higher." Others are bothered by the overall argument about smoking's costs to society.  MIT economist Jeffrey Harris "said the real danger is to suggest that government weigh the savings from early deaths in making public policy decisions."  He noted that Viscusi's study does not include "a key benefit to our society:  We value life."

<center><h3><a name=aa17>San Francisco Files its Own "Medicaid" Suit</a></h3></a></center>


San Francisco, CA May 16, 1996. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors Health, Public Safety and Environment committee today passed a resolution calling on the city to file a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry to seek payment of health care costs associated with smoking-related diseases.

<p>Supervisor Angela Alioto's resolution will be acted on by the full board within two weeks, according to AP, which also says SF Mayor Willie Brown "is expected to sign the measure." Alioto told AP that 23 other counties in California would join the suit.

<p>In the topsy-turvy world of California politics, the characters grow more interesting all the time:

<p>PETE WILSON

<p>Last year California Governor Pete Wilson signed the country's most sweeping statewide smoking restrictions. He also appointed as his presidential campaign chairman Craig Fuller, then senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris. For the last few years, Wilson has been in a fierce battle with tobacco control advocates as he has sought to gut the voter-approved Proposition 99 funds for tobacco education. Among Wilson's allies--the California Medical Association.

<p>KIMBERLY BELSHE

<p>In December of 1993, Wilson appointed Kimberly Belshe--the chief Southern California tobacco spokesperson against Proposition 99--to head the Department of Health Services, which runs the program. Yet in October of 1994, Belshe fought to save the disputed "I believe nicotine is not addictive" Prop. 99 ad, which had been called libelous by lawyers for then-RJR head James Johnston. Belshe strongly vilified the "strong-arm tactics" she said RJR lawyers were using to intimidate stations from running the ad.

<p>WILLIE BROWN

<p>When San Francisco, Mayor Willie Brown was State Assembly speaker, he was known as "the Marlboro Man," and in at least one year reportedly accepted more tobacco funds than any other politician in the country--including Virginia Rep. Thomas Bliley.

<center><h3><a name=aa18>LAWSUITS: Woman Can Sue Supermarket for Youth Sales--Appeals Court</a></h3></a></center></h3>

San Francisco, CA. June 29, 1996. A state appeals court today allowed a woman to sue a store chain for selling cigarettes to minors.

<p><i>[California's] unfair competition statute provides that enforcement actions may be brought by the state attorney general, any district attorney, any city attorney, a city prosecutor 'or by any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public,</i> ruled the 1st District Court of Appeals, overturning a lower court's decision by a vote of 3-0.

<p>The "person acting for the interests of ... the general public" is Carol Levy, of Stop Youth Addiction, a one-woman corporation, according to UPI. Her son, Donald Driscoll is the attorney handling the suit. Levy's husband died of lung cancer in the 60s.

<p>SYA's suit was filed against Lucky Stores, Inc., a supermarket chain. The suit seeks $10 billion restitution of profits from illegal sales to minors, an injunction against further sales, and attorney's fees.

<p>"When you walk into Lucky's with a check, they're very careful [about checking ID] because they could lose money. When you walk in saying you're 18 they don't care.," said Driscoll.

<p>The suit arose out of a sting operation Levy organized in 1994. The 100 other stores caught in the sting agreed to settle by signing a contract promising not to sell cigarettes to minors, and in some cases by also paying as much as $100 a day for SYA's legal fees.

<p>Lucky refused.

<p>In response to the ruling, a Lucky lawyer said: "Lucky and several other stores do not believe it is appropriate for a private profit-making corporation to hire minors to violate the law so that he can sue to recover attorneys fees. . .  Lucky believes very strongly that the enforcement of California's penal code provisions properly rests with California prosecutors, particularly in this case where prosecutors are not permitted to bring a lawsuit . . . unless they comply with very strict procedures."

<p>Lucky claims it has strict procedures in place--including a cigarette cabinet which must be unlocked with each sale, and which each time reminds the clerk to check for ID. Lucky will appeal to California's Supreme Court.

<center><h3><a name=aa19>ART: San Diego Museum Cancels PM Sponsorship</a></h3></center></a>

San Diego, CA. May 1, 1996 The San Diego Museum of Art has canceled Philip Morris' sponsorship of a summer exhibit of life-size sculptures of wild horses--a subject emblematic of PM's "Marlboro" brand--which would have run during the Philip Morris-sponsored Republican convention in San Diego (Aug. 12-15), and been the focus of receptions and events. The exhibition is now at risk, as no alternate sponsor has been found.

<p>The show's sculptor, Deborah Butterfield, had previously told the LA Times that her father had died at 63 of heart disease aggravated by his smoking, and that she was uncomfortable with the PM sponsorship, but the museum had told her no other sponsors were available. 

<p>"I really have to lay down with the devil to do this but . . . you know, you make choices," Butterfield told the Times. Now that the museum has reponded to the calls of protest it received, it is hoping the community will help.

<p>It is the second area event which has snubbed Philip Morris' sponsorship. Last month, Del Mar Fair Board canceled its arrangement to let PM sell Marlboros at the "Fiesta Latino Day."

<p>The art world has experienced an unprecedented distancing of artists from Philip Morris sponsorship recently. Protests were made at "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art," exhibits in New York and California last year.  Adrian Piper withdrew her work, saying she'd be glad to hang portraits of her parents who died of tobacco-related diseases instead. Long-time tobacco industry critic Hans Haacke hung a "disclaimer" next to his work. 10 other artists in the show also protested, including Sol LeWitt, Yvonne Rainer and Victor Burgin.

<li>Visit the San Diego Museum of Art's <a href="http://www.sddt.com/~sdma/files/exhibits/exhibits5.html"> Butterfield Page</a>, which as of May 2, still read, "Deborah Butterfield is sponsored by Philip Morris Companies Inc." 

<li>Some of Haacke's works, from an exhibition canceled at the Guggenheim because they dealt with "'specific social situations' not considered art," are listed at: <a href="http://fileroom.aaup.uic.edu/FileRoom/documents/Cases/86hansHaacke.html"> The File Room</a> of censorship.

<center><h3><a name=aa20>Writer Slams Magazines on Tobacco Ads</a></h3></a></center>

Boston, MA. May 10, 1996. Today's Boston Globe carried an article titled "Sound of Silence on Tobacco Ads" by staff writer Derrick Z. Jackson, who searched recent popular magazines for articles on health, and found no mention of the number one preventable cause of death (smoking) in any that carried tobacco ads.

<p>Jackson cited the 1992  study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that magazines that did not accept cigarette ads were 40 percent more likely to have articles on the dangers of smoking.

<p>One example he cited: "The cover of the May 13 Fortune was devoted to men battling prostate cancer. But the call to fight lung cancer, which is as simple as refusing to pick up a cigarette, is close to nonexistent"

<p>Other magazines Jackson mentioned that had health articles, but nothing on tobacco were:

<li>Elle
<li>Family Circle
<li>First for Women
<li>Harper's Bazaar
<li>Ladies Home Journal
<li>Mademoiselle
<li>McCall's
<li>Mirabella
<li>New Woman
<li>Swing
<li>Women's World

<p>Besides buying silence on tobacco issues, Jackson said such ads buy legitimacy. With ads prominently displayed in other popular magazines like People, Time, Sports Illustrated, Life, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Spin, Hot Rod, Motor Trend, Sport, New York and Premiere, Jackson said, "you can understand why . . . many teen-agers see smoking as legitimate."

<p><i>Magazines publishers who accept ads from tobacco,</i> Jackson concluded, <i>do not have the courage to say the profits are picked up over someone's dead body.</i>

<center><h3><a name=aa21>PEOPLE: Herb Caen Has Inoperable Lung Cancer</a></h3></a></center>


May 30, 1996. San Francisco's most beloved columnist, Herb Caen, told his readers today he has inoperable lung cancer.

<p>In explaining his column's uncharacteristically sporadic appearances in the San Francisco Chronicle, he said, "I do wish I could have told you that my long silences were indeed due to The World's Greatest Hangover." </p>

<p>After disclosing how his doctor found a "pigeon-egg" sized tumor on his right lung, Caen, 80,  said, "To answer your next question, no, I don't smoke but I did for about 40 years, with no blips on the X-rays. I quit cold turkey some 25 years ago, but the specialists simply shrug off this kind of information. And so, in a lightning flash, I passed from the land of the well to the world of the unwell, where I will now dwell for what I hope is a long time.''</p>

<p>"My life is now controlled by a dream team of specialists, who keep my once-pristine medicine cabinet stocked with pills -- the cabinet that once contained nothing more medical than Band-Aids. Old ones. Foolish pride: I considered myself indestructible," he wrote.</p>

<p>Caen said his chemotherapy would limit his future columns to three-a-week, at most.</p>

<p>"The Sackamenna  Kid" (Sacramento, where he was born in 1916) fell hopelessly in love with "The City" on a visit when a child, moved there in 1936, and has been writing a daily column of opinion, puns, and area gossip and arcana for almost 60 years, since 1938. He was diagnosed 5 weeks ago.</p>

<p>In just the last 2 months:</p>

<ul>
<li>He was awarded a special Pulitzer award for his "extraordinary and continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of his city."</li> 

<li>He married his long-time girl friend Ann Moller (his fourth marriage).</li> 

<li>The name of the Embarcadero Promenade was changed to "Herb Caen Way."</li> 

</ul>
<p>In 1986, Caen reported on "high-school age kids gleefully grabbing for free Yves St. Laurent perfumed ciggies being handed out on street corners" with no apparent requests for identification.</p>

<p>More recently, he supported his close friend Willie Brown for Mayor of SF, saying, "What you see is all the flash and dash, but what you get is a caring, hard-working, smart, honest, brilliant, wonderful man." Brown is known to others as the "Marlboro Man" for the extraordinary amount of money he received from tobacco interests when he was speaker of the California Assembly.</p>

<center><h3><a name=aa22>PEOPLE: Morton Downey, with Lung Cancer, to Fight Tobacco</a></h3></a></center>

New York, NY. June 18, 1996. Morton Downey, Jr., the outspoken, chain-smoking talk-show-host-turned-pro-tobacco-advocate has revealed he has lung cancer, and will begin an anti-smoking campaign aimed at kids.

<p>Downey, 63, a former 3-4-pach-a-day smoker, told Reuters, "Just because I've been foolish in not listening to medical warnings about the dangers of smoking, doesn't mean that I shouldn't deliver a strong anti-smoking message to today's youth in their own vernacular."

<p>Downey plans a TV special called, "Tough Guy," according to AP, at the end of which a kid is being pressured to smoke. With an appropriate gesture, the kid responds, "Smoke this!."

<p>Only last January, Downey was a board member of the National Smokers Alliance. He quit, he said, when he "realized that the major tobacco companies were lying when they said they weren't adding dangerous levels of nicotine to cigarette tobacco. They're nothing but tobacco terrorists."

<p>Reuters said Downey was due to "undergo surgery on his right lung" within weeks.

<p>Downey pioneered the modern era of "shock TV" with his syndicated "The Morton Downey, Jr. Show" in the late 1980s.

<center><h3><a name=aa23><i>Exeunt Omnes:</i> RJR's Johnston is Last of the Tobacco 7 to Exit Business</a></h3></a></center>

<i>I'm considering Friday the first day of my new, more balanced life. Over those seven years . . . I pushed off the people and things that I love in order to meet the constant demands of the job. I finally decided it was time to put my life back in balance.</i>

<p>Winston-Salem, NC. June 28, 1996 James R. Johnston, vice- chairman and director of RJR Nabisco Holdings and CEO of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Worldwide, retired today.

<p>Johnston is the last of the 7 tobacco executives who testified before Congress in April, 1994 to resign from the business. Analysts say the departure of so many top executives in any industry in so short a time--2 years and 2 months--is extremely unusual.

<p>Johnston had worked for RJR in the early eighties, but was at CitiBank when asked in 1989 to head the domestic tobacco arm of debt-laden RJR, which had just been the subject of a $29 Billion LBO, and had seen the humiliating failure of its "smokeless" cigarette, <i>Premier.</i> Under his tenure, morale improved, but RJR's tobacco business remained stagnant, firmly in second place behind titan Philip Morris.

<p>What market gains the company made came primarily from the success of its expensively promoted Camel brand--which led in turn to a continuing barrage of criticism of the campaign, which was accused of targeting youth. Johnston gained national attention at the 1994 Waxman hearings, and was the only executive to talk with Ted Koppel on Nightline.

<p>Johnston indicated that after 7 years tending to a business in perpetual crisis, he wanted to spend more time with his wife Beverly and two daughters. Johnston's only son, Michael, 18, shot and killed himself in his bedroom in February, 1995.

<p>Andrew J. Schindler, head of U.S. operations, and Pierre de Labouchere, head of the international unit will now report directly to RJR Nabisco chairman and CEO Steven Goldstone--who only last May succeeded Charles M. Harper.

<h4><a name=aa24>SIDEBAR: THE HISTORIC 1994 CONGRESSIONAL APPEARANCE</a></h4>
The tobacco company executives who appeared before Henry Waxman's (D-CA) House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment beginning April 14, 1994, were (from left to right in the famous photo):

<p><li>Donald S. Johnston, president and CEO of American Tobacco Company 
<br>Johnston retired December 22, 1994 when ATC was acquired by Brown & Williamson Tobacco. Johnston had been with ATC since January 6, 1986; he had previously worked for Brown & Williamson Tobacco from October 23, 1965 until January, 1985. Johnston said ATC "has no desire or intent to manipulate nicotine."
<ul>QUOTE: [N]othing is done in the tobacco processing or manufacture of cigarettes or filters by the American Tobacco Co. to increase nicotine beyond that naturally occurring in tobacco . . . American has no desire or intent to 'manipulate' nicotine.</ul>

<p><li>Thomas Sandefur Jr., chairman and CEO of Brown and William Tobacco Corporation
<br> Sandefur left B&W at age 55 in June, 1995; the company cited medical reasons; Sandefur was reported to have a rare blood disease.

<p><li>Edward A. Horrigan, chairman and CEO of Liggett Group Inc. 
<br>Horrigan gave up his CEO position in June, 1994, and his chairmanship on Dec. 31, 1994. He had only been with Liggett for about a year when he testified; he was a major RJR management figure in the leveraged buyout of the company in 1989.
<ul>QUOTE: It is outrageous for you to assume that we (tobacco industry heads) meet and talk about this issue. . .  They are competitors, not conspirators.</ul>

<p><li>Andrew H. Tisch, chairman and CEO Lorillard Tobacco Company
<br>Tisch left both positions May 31, 1995 to take an expanded role at Lorillard's parent company, Loews Corp., which the Tisch family runs.
<ul>QUOTE: Lorillard does not take any steps to assure a minimal level of nicotine in our products.</ul>

<p><li>Joseph Taddeo, president of United States Tobacco Company
<br>Taddeo's resignation, said to be due to disappointing sales and disagreements with management at parent UST Inc., was announced in June, 1995.
<ul>QUOTES:
<li>U.S. Tobacco believes that no ingredient which it adds to tobacco in the manufacture of its smokeless tobacco products would result in adverse health consequences to a consumer of our product 
<li>Oral tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer
<li>Without revealing proprietary information, I can tell you that every ingredient which U.S. Tobacco adds to tobacco in the manufacture of its products is a common food item or approved for use in food, with the single exception of (an approved ingredient) for use in the manufacture of tobacco products
<li>Oral tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer</ul>

<p><li>James W. Johnston, CEO of R.J. Reynolds.
<br>Johston retired June 28, 1996.
<ul>QUOTES:
<li>If I thought that ad (the Joe Camel campaign) caused any young people to begin smoking, I'd pull it in a heartbeat
<li>Would you rather board a plane with a pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills?
<li>We do not do anything to hook smokers or keep them hooked. . . We no more manipulate nicotine in cigarettes than coffee makers manipulate caffeine. . . but no one is suggesting the FDA regulate coffee, cola or tea as drugs.
<li>Don't you think there are 45 million Americans who resent being characterized as helpless, pathetic addicts? You can characterize smokers as addicts, like some of these gentlemen did today, but common sense tells you they are not. My God, I'm no addict. I smoke. I've just been through a long day. You didn't see me biting a hole in this table, did you?
<li>If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold, then ban them. Some smokers will obey the law, but many will not. People will be selling cigarettes out of the trunks of cars, cigarettes made by who knows who, made of who knows what.
<li>The goal of the anti-smoking industry is to bring back prohibition.
<li>WAXMAN: "Does smoking cause heart disease?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may
<br>WAXMAN: Does it cause lung cancer?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may
<br>WAXMAN: Emphysema?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may.</ul>

<p><li>William I. Campbell, CEO, Philip Morris USA
<br>Campbell retired in June, 1995 at 51; in September, 1995, he was hired to teach business courses at the University of Richmond; in January, 1996, he was hired to run Citicorp's branch banking operations worldwide as executive vice president for retail banking operations.
<ul>QUOTES: 
<li>Philip Morris does not manipulate nor independently control the level of nicotine in our products. . . . Cigarettes contain nicotine because it occurs naturally in tobacco. Nicotine contributes to the taste of cigarettes and the pleasures of smoking. . . When creating a cigarette for a tar category, we select a particular tobacco blend and flavors to provide 'uniqueness' to the product. So how do we manipulate or independently control nicotine as our critics charge? The answer is we don't. We accept the nicotine levels that result from this process.
<li>Smokers are not drug users or addicts, and we do not appreciate being characterized as such.</ul>

<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS THE FAMOUS "ADDICTION" EXCHANGE:</strong>

<p>REP. WYDEN: Let me ask you first, and I'd like to just go down the row, whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive. I've heard virtually all of you touch on it--yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
<br>WILLIAM I. CAMPBELL (Philip Morris): I believe that nicotine is not addictive, yes.
<br>REP. WYDEN: Mr. Johnson...
<br>JAMES JOHNSTON (RJ Reynolds): Uh, Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definition of addiction. There is no intoxication--
<br>REP. WYDEN: We'll take that as a no. And again, time is short, if you can just, I think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive, I'd just like to have this for the record.
<br>JOSEPH TADDEO (US Tobacco): I don't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.
<br>ANDREW TISCH (P Lorillard): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>EDWARD HORRIGAN (Liggett Group): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>THOMAS SANDEFUR (Brown & Williamson): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>DONALD JOHNSTON (American Tobacco Co.): And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive.

<center><h3><a name=aa25>OBIT: American Brands Director Alley, 66, Commits Suicide</a></h3></a></center></h3>

New Canaan, CT. July 26, 1996. William J. Alley, who was chairman and CEO of American Brands in 1994 when the diversified company announced its intention to sell its American Tobacco unit to Brown & Williamson, committed suicide in his home today, according to police.

<p>Alley came into tobacco from the life insurance business. He was chairman of Franklin Life when the company was acquired by American Brands in 1979, and was named CEO of American Brands in May, 1987. He was still CEO in April, 1994, when Donald Johnston, president of American's tobacco unit, told Henry Waxman's Congressional subcommittee, "And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive."

<p>At the time of his death, Alley was a director of American Brands. He was also serving as a director of Olin Corp., Amsted Industries Inc., Central Illinois Public Service Co., Cipsco Inc. and Rayonier Inc..

<p>He is survived by his wife, Deborah, and 5 children.

<p>Two other prominent tobacco figures died this month: Thomas Sanderfur (July 15, 1996), the Brown & Williamson CEO who testified in 1994, and former Brown & Williamson General Counsel Addison Yeaman (88, July 7, 1996), who wrote, "we are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms."

<h3><a name=aa26>NEW WEB SITES</a></h3>


<h3><a name=aa27>THE FUNNY PAGES</a></h3>


CBS-TV's "48 Hours," April 10, 1996, featured a segment on Dennis Parone's "Cannabis Buyer's Club" in San Francisco. One shot focused on a handwritten sign hanging above the sales counter: 

<p>
<strong><blockquote>Thank you for POT smoking.
<br>PLEASE do NOT smoke tobacco here.</blockquote></strong>

The US Tobacco Company has announced that between now and Dec. 31 it will donate a portion of its sales--at least $1M--to the National Volunteer Fire Council. In return US Tobacco asked that for the rest of the year, everyone pretend that cigarettes don't cause cancer.
<br>--Norm MacDonald, Saturday Night Live, May 11, 1996

<p>A secret R.J. Reynolds marketing report in 1984 stressed the importance of selling cigarettes to young people to "replace" other smokers. Says the Cutler Daily Scoop, "Fortunately, plans for a 'Nicotine at Nite' cable channel fell through." 
<br>--Los Angeles Times, July 12, 1996

<p>Jay Leno offered this plot for Independence Day II: ``Bob Dole is president. He convinces the aliens that smoking is safe. They all get emphysema and die."

<center><h3><a name=aa1>DOLE: "Just Cut Out the Advertising"</a></h3></a></center></h3>


New York, NY July 5, 1996. Little noticed by most during Wednesday's Katie Couric interview was presidential contender Bob Dole's suggestion to "[j}ust cut out the advertising" of cigarettes.

<p>The statement's implications may have been lost on reporters already shocked by Dole's suggestions that Couric may be violating FCC rules by "advertising" Democratic positions, or that conservative ex-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop may have been "a little bit" brainwashed by the liberal media. The idea of banning all cigarette advertising, coming from a government-hands-off politician, may well have been an unfortunate misstatement, as such a sweeping proposal seems to go far beyond anything the FDA or President Clinton has yet suggested.

<p>In full, Dole said to Couric on a segment of NBC's "Today" which had been taped Sunday but aired Wednesday morning:

<blockquote>Cigarettes aren't good for you. I voted for tougher smoking laws as far as giving it back to the states. States ought to handle it. I don't have any quarrel with it. Just cut out the advertising, do all the other things. But it is legal.</blockquote>

<p>It was unclear what Dole was referring to when he said, "do all the other things."

<p>The Washington, DC-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids immediately issued a press release which states that the organization 

<blockquote>...applauds Sen. Dole's groundbreaking statement yesterday endorsing a ban on tobacco advertising . . . [H]is statement makes clear that he recognizes that tobacco advertising increases the use of tobacco products by young people. . .

<p>While some people are saying that we should trust the tobacco industry to regulate their own advertising, we agree with Sen. Dole that it is better to "just cut out the advertising.</blockquote>

<center><h3><a name=aa2>Teens to Protest Ticketmaster/Joe Camel Promotion</a></h3></center></a>

Seattle, WA. May 2, 1996. Teen tobacco-control groups today announced that on Saturday they will protest Ticketmaster's participation in RJ Reynolds' Joe Camel "Rockin' Road Trip." The "Road Trip" is a promotional campaign in which Ticketmaster offers gift certificates to rock concerts for "Camel Cash," coupons obtainable from Camel cigarette packs

<p>The teens' protest will start at 1PM on Pine St., outside the Westlake Center Ticketmaster outlet in downtown Seattle. Participating groups include REACT, SMOOTH and ALERT.

<center><h3><a name=aa3>CA: Pols to Guide Scientific Research</a></h3></a></center></h3>

Sacramento, CA. July 3, 1996. The tortured history California's Proposition 99 (1988) cigarette tax funds--which at one time found the California Medical Association fighting side-by-side with tobacco interests and Governor Pete Wilson to redirect them--took another bizarre turn today. State budget negotiators have agreed to allow political appointees to approve or disapprove research funded with the $60 million the tax brings in for tobacco research and education.

<p>HOW THE POLITICAL REVIEW WOULD WORK

<p>The University of California, which has previously overseen the funds and assigned research based on a peer-review process, would prepare a spending plan for the Department of Finance. A governor-appointed Tobacco Education Research Oversight Committee would then conduct public hearings and make recommendations.

<p>The budget provision was backed by new Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who last week attached another provision specifically forbidding the state Department of Health Services's TV ads from attacking the tobacco industry.

<p>According to a UC study, Pringle has received $25,250 in tobacco contributions since 1993. A spokesperson said Pringle was "philosophically opposed to using taxpayer dollars to attack any industry."

<p>REACTION

<p>The research community was in an uproar, partly because UC said they would accept the plan. A UC spokesperson said he saw no major change in how UC approved research, and that he could understand how the state would want to keep close tabs on the allocation of so much money.

<p>One UC researcher could be particularly hard-hit by the provision: Dr. Stanton Glantz, a scientist whose research has often rebutted industry claims, and who is considered by many to be the tobacco industry's worst enemy. Glantz was the target of a federal-level scientific de-funding effort last year. "But this goes way beyond me," he said. "This is an outrageous intrusion into the scientific and academic process. I cannot imagine a clearer intrusion into the academic freedom of a university."

<center><h3><a name=aa4>MA: Bill Would require Disclosure of "The List"</a></h3></a></center></h3>

July 26, 1996. Boston, MA. Gov. Weld has said he will sign an unprecedented bill which would require cigarette manufacturers to reveal the "recipes"--added ingredients and their amounts--of each brand of cigarette. The result of the bill, passed by the Senate 39-0 last Thursday (7/25/96), may be public disclosure of "The List" of cigarette additives for the first time in history.

<p>Though manufacturers revealed their additives to the government in 1994, they were allowed to present a compiled list of 599--with no brands or amounts specified. In addition, the list was kept secret from the public.

<p>The Tolman bill (Sen. Warren Tolman, D-Waterford is chief sponsor) would require manufacturers to present their information to the Mass. Department of Public Health, which could then release the list to the public.

<p><i>Every food and every drug has to list its ingredients and tobacco products will now be held to the same standard,</i> Tolman said.

<center><h3><a name=aa5>MA: Weld Signs Tobacco Ingredient Disclosure Law</a></h3></a></center></h3>

Boston, MA. August 2, 1996. Gov. Weld signed the <a href="http://www.jointogether.org/news/jto/Show_News.qry?News_uid=8392">Tolman bill</a> at a news conference. The law will take effect in 3 months. Meanwhile, even as the conference was being held, tobacco companies were filing suit to overturn the law, charging that federal labeling regulations preempt state provisions, and that the  law would force them to disclose trade secrets.

<center><h3><a name=aa6>ENGLAND: BAT Chief Wins Cambridge Chair Fight</a></h3></a></center></h3>

After a 6-month ethical brouhaha, Cambridge University's parliamentary body approved by a 2-1 margin (1,128 to 583) a L1.6 million donation by tobacco giant BAT Industries Plc. Accompanying the donation is a chair in international relations named for BAT's former chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy.

<p>Approached by the press as a battle between idealists and pragmatists, the furor--which pitted academic titans against each other--was sparked by Cambridge's creation of a Sir Patrick Sheehy Chair in international relations last February. Opponents--including the University's senior medical academic, <p>Sir Keith Peters--objected to accepting money from, and honoring the chairman of, a tobacco company.

<p>Oxford recently set up an ethics committee to screen donations. Cambridge, instead, sent out a postal ballot to 3,300 dons and senior administrators.

<p>In defense of the donation, Sir Roger Tomkys, master of Pembroke College, said, <i>I respect the ethical hesitations by some senior members of the university but this new chair will not sell a single cigarette. . . If you examine the business morality of every commercial organization, there is no clean money out there. You can't take money from the arms trade, from the pharmaceutical industry because of animal experiments, or from the banks because of their Third World policies.</i>

<p>Some of the arguments that were made against the donation: 

<blockquote><p><li><i>Cambridge University has sold its good name to a company which profits from sales of a lethal and highly-addictive product. The university will inevitably be used by BAT to promote tobacco in its developing world markets.</i>--Pamela Furness, chief executive of ASH

<p><li><i>We wouldn't accept money from Saddam Hussein to set up a chair in Arabic studies.</i>--Professor Nick Davies, director of the Institute of Public Health

<p><li><i>BAT kill half their regular customers so they have to spend a lot of money buying goodwill.</i> --Professor Richard Peto, Imperial Cancer Research Fund.</blockquote>

<p>A spokesperson for BAT said, <i>The idea that we are trying to buy respectability is laughable. We are one of the UK's top 10 companies.</i>

<p>BAT is the second-largest cigarette manufacturer in the world behind Philip Morris, and is the UK manufacturer of Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Lucky Strike brands.

<p>Sheehy was banned from the US this week in a separate matter involving Sherritt International, a Canadian mining company the State Department said had confiscated US property in Cuba. Under a new controversial US law meant to punish abuses in Cuba, Sheehy and several other directors have been notified they are banned from the US.

London, England. July 15, 1996. Hamish Maxwell, who steered Philip Morris' expanding fortunes in the 1980s, is expected to take over as Chairman of <a href="http://www.hillandknowlton.com/public/wpp.htm "> WPP Group PLC,</a> the world's largest advertising and marketing group, according to the Times of London.

<p>WPP owns giant advertising agencies Ogilvy & Mather and J. Walter Thompson and one-time tobacco PR firm Hill and Knowlton.

<center><h3><a name=aa7>FRANCE: PM "Milk" Ad Banned</a></h3></a></center>

Paris, France. June 27, 1996 A French court, ruling on a case brought by 77 cookie and cracker manufacturers, banned Philip Morris's ad campaign which implied that second-hand smoke was less dangerous than milk or biscuits. The court could fine PM US$200,000 for each infraction of France's advertising regulations.

<p>A "shocked and surprised" Philip Morris said it would immediately appeal the decision, but that the campaign's purpose--its third major effort to hold back EU tobacco control legislation--had been served. "We feel that we have got our message out."

<p>The court banned the ads because:
--advertising of tobacco products is illegal --comparative advertising is illegal
--advertising of tobacco products is "very harmful" (an echo of the phraseology of France's required health warnings) to the interests of biscuit makers

<p>"You don't need to use cookies to sell tobacco," said the lawyer for the cookie makers, but a European PM spokesperson said, "We're comparing scientific studies, not products."

<p>The company said, "The biscuit industry . . ., should not be trying . . . to suppress public awareness and discussion -- they should be joining with us in the effort to make the public aware of the dangers of misinterpretation of scientific studies."

<p>The print ad campaign was launched June 9 in European Union countries. The campaign cites certain studies to indicate that second hand smoke risks are less than the risks of drinking milk or chlorinated water, eating a biscuit a day, or peppering one's food. Tobacco control advocates and some European officials claim the ads are misleading, and do not address the risks of respiratory diseases and infections in children.

<p>A suit brought by Belgian biscuit makers who hold "the ads are defaming" was denied last Friday, but the suit will return to the courts this week. Italy and Holland are also looking into advertising code violations.

<center><h3><a name=aa8>ROMANIA: Cig Prices Skyrocket After Anti-smuggling Measures</a></h3></a></center>

Bucharest, Romania. May 8, 1996. Cigarette prices in Romania have increased 40% on the heels of the government's new anti-smuggling drive.

<p>Arrests of smuggling kingpins--one was alleged to be responsible for fully 1/5 of all cigarettes consumed in this heavy-smoking nation--and the institution of a new tax stamp program on May 1 have led to a severe cigarette shortage.

<p>Much of the problem has to do with delays in supplying foreign vendors with the stamps which verify origin and certify that customs fees--up to 300%--have been paid. The stamps are pink for local brands, green for imported.

<p>American brands have all but disappeared from retailers' shelves, but can be found later at night, stampless, at up to 3 times their normal prices.

<p>Romania has been known for having extremely low cigarette prices. Current prices for a pack of US or UK cigarettes range from US$1-$2. The average weekly salary in Romania is US$25.

<p>One third of adult Romanians smoke, and the country is Eastern Europes 2nd largest consumer of cigarettes behind Poland.

<center><h3><a name=aa9>ROMANIA: RJR Gives Health Warnings</a></h3></a></center>

Bucharest, Romania. June 11, 1996. RJR has voluntarily begun slapping its own health warnings on packs of its Romanian-produced brands--even though such warnings are not required by the government, according to Reuters.

<p>"Giving up smoking now considerably reduces the risk to your health" read the warnings, which are located on the side of brands produced in RJR's Bucharest factory, and are "tiny," Reuters says.

<p>Gerard Cayla, RJR general manager for Romania told Reuters, "We have been the first to put them on, as a token of respect for Romanian consumers."

<p>Romania has few restrictions on advertising and sale of cigarettes, but lately the cigarette market has been affecting national concerns in other ways.

<p>The government recently issued a tax stamp system to control rampant smuggling, but snafus led to a severe shortage of smuggled foreign cigarettes, and skyrocketing prices for local brands. 

<p>In fact, the ruling Social Democrats party blamed its recent heavy losses in a recent round of elections on cigarette price-gouging by retailers. The government responded by immediately instituting a price ceiling for cigarettes--at about half the going street prices--and hopes to do better in the next round of local elections this Sunday.

<p>"The Romanian Tobacco Authority will set retail prices . . . to eliminate the incorrect behavior of some traders ahead of the elections," said an official.

<center><h3><a name=aa11>POLAND: New Smoking Restrictions Take Effect</a></h3></center></a>

Warsaw, Poland. May 1, 1996. Poland's sweeping new smoking restrictions went into effect today. Smoking is now allowed only in designated smoking areas in many public places, including workplaces, hospitals, schools, and sports centers.

<p>Tobacco advertising is no longer allowed on TV and radio, in cinemas, youth and children's publications, hospitals, schools and sports centers or events. The sale of single cigarettes in vending machines or to those under 18 is now against the law.

<p>The bill authorizing the restrictions had once contained a total advertising ban, but the provision was considered harmful to publishers and to Poland's own plans to privatize the industry.

<p>The loosened advertising restrictions led Premier Lech Walesa to try to veto the bill last December, just before he left office. "The ambitious goal of the bill will not be reached if even a limited possibility of advertising tobacco remains," he said.

<center><h3><a name=aa12>PHILIPPINES: Supreme Court Lets Tan Off Tax Charges</a></h3></a></center>

Manila, The Philippines. June 4, 1996

<p>Amid charges that judges were "very lavishly bribed," the Supreme Court ruled the government had improperly prosecuted beer and tobacco magnate Lucio Tan and 67 officers of Fortune Tobacco Company for tax evasion.

<p>The decision deeply displeased president Fidel Ramos, who has been working towards tax reform.

<p>The charges against the three judges were made in a public letter from an unauthenticated group called "Crusade Against Corruption in the Supreme Court," and shook the country. In a rare statement, the Supreme Court condemned the  'poison pen letter' and its "cowardly and devious author." The statement called the charges "extremely vicious, scurrilous, false and malicious, libelous, unfair, baseless, mere `matters of guesswork,' the product of a malevolent mind. . . The Court declares its full support of and continuing confidence in these three members." Even government prosecutors excoriated the letter.

<p>Within days of the letter's release, the 3 accused judges--Santiago Kapunan, Josue Bellosillo and Regino Hermosisima--ruled for Tan in a 3-2 decision; in the decision, one judge called the government's task force, which had been set up to prosecute Tan, a "dictatorial technique."

<p>One of the dissenting judges wrote an unusually harsh critique. "I will have no part in the shocking process, especially in light of the fact that the government cries out that the people have been cheated and defrauded of their taxes to the tune of allegedly 25.6 billion pesos, and yet it is not given by this court even a beggar's chance to prove it," wrote Teodoro Padilla.

<p>The decision severely cripples the government's tax-reform and anti-corruption drive, which could threaten the country's recent economic gains.

<p>Tan, a Chinese immigrant who first worked as a janitor, is one of the richest men in the Philippines, worth an estimated $7 billion. Besides Fortune Tobacco, he owns Asia Brewery, and controls Philippine Airlines.

<center><h3><a name=aa13>ZIMBABWE: Tobacco Exports Threatened by Child Labor Protest</a></h3></a></center>

Harare, Zimbabwe. May 16, 1996. "A major importer of our tobacco has threatened to stop dealing with us because of the issue of child labor on our farms,"  a senior government official told COMTEX today.

<p>At issue are child labor provisions among 176 labor-oriented basic human rights conventions, which the International Labour Organisation is requesting countries to ratify. Zimbabwe has ratified 6.

<p>The ILO defines child labor as denying a child education, or assigning labor that interferes with the child's basic development. An ILO official told COMTEX the organization was lenient with developing countries, but that the child labor issue "is very important to us."

<p>The official told COMTEX that farmers do provide schooling for children, who are often in the fields to "supplement family incomes." The lack of ratification could affect all Zimbabwe exports, but tobacco could hurt the country most.

<p>Zimbabwe is the world's third largest producer of flue-cured tobacco, next to Brazil and the United States. Tobacco is one of Zimbabwe's major exports, accounting for about 30 percent of total export earnings. It is also the single largest foreign currency earner, and is expected to bring in $700 million this year.

<p>50% of Zimbabwean tobacco is exported to the European Union, 20% to the Far East, and 10% to the United States.

<center><h3><a name=aa14>ZIMBABWE: 10% Tobacco Levy Passed</a></h3></a></center>

Harare, Zimbabwe. May 30, 1996. The Zimbabwe Parliament today approved a 10% tobacco levy, to be divided equally between growers and merchants.

<p>The unexpectedly high levy was pushed through by amendments to a less burdensome proposal by President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. Mugabe is expected to sign the bill.</p>

<p>The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association said the levy represented a double taxation, and could undermine Zimbabwe's position as the world's third largest tobacco producer behind the United States and Brazil. </p>

<p>Zimbabwe has had tough tobacco sales for the last 9 years, due to bad rains and some worldwide tobacco gluts.</p>

<p>This year, because of good rains during Zimbabwe's growing season (Nov. to March), tobacco is expected to bring in US$700 million, over three times the income of previous years. The levy would cost the industry some US$61.1 million.</p>

<p>The levy was also criticized as being especially harmful to black tobacco farmers, who generally own smaller farms.</p>

<center><h3><a name=aa15>A&P Removes Vending Machines</a></h3></a></center></h3>


Montvale, NJ. July 11, 1996. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company announced today that it would remove all cigarette vending machines from its supermarkets by the end of July.

<p>A&P chairman and chief executive officer James Wood said, "We are in full support of President Clinton's effort to reduce the use of tobacco among young people."

<p>The 1,000-store chain also has instituted an age identification training videotape for cashiers, a lock-out software program that makes it impossible for tobacco products to be scanned at checkout counters without confirmation of the customer's age, and employee compliance checks at all stores.

<center><h3><a name=pmproposals>Tobacco Industry Proposes Youth Access Curbs</a></h3></a></center>
May 15, 1996. Attempting to preempt FDA regulation PHILIP MORRIS AND US TOBACCO sent a series of proposals to control youth access to tobacco. Tobacco control advocates were unimpressed, saying the provisions in practise amounted to a "stunt.". The White House said it was "somewhat encouraged and slightly disappointed." Notably absent from participation were R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co.

<center><h3><a name=aa16>Smoking is Good ???</a></h3></a>

<i> by Jeanne Scott (70673.3250@compuserve.com) </i></center>

<p>May 7,1 996. Under the header, "Making a Case for Death," the New York Times this week studied smoking's costs to society, including economic studies that claim to demonstrate the "inconvenient truth ... that smokers cover their own medical costs, not only by paying cigarette taxes ... but also by dying before collecting their full share of health and retirement benefits."

<p>Supporting such an argument at the very least raises several questions, including:  "How do we calculate what smokers cost everybody else?  Should we acknowledge that sometimes death is helpful to the public treasury?  And if that's so, where might such an argument end?"

<p>Two economic studies purport to show that smokers more than pay for the health costs they incur.  A Rand Corp. study conducted by University of Minnesota health economist Willard Manning showed that while smokers have higher health costs and died earlier than nonsmokers, society comes "out ahead" financially when the taxes they pay are figured into the equation.  A second study conducted by Duke University economist W. Kip Viscusi "found that smokers subsidize nonsmokers even without taxes."  After considering the savings in retirement benefits and nursing home costs that result from smokers' earlier deaths, Viscusi concluded that each pack of cigarettes sold in the U.S. results in a five cents "net gain to society."   In particular, he found that smoking provides "big savings" in retirement benefits -- up to $30 billion per year in pension costs are saved because many smokers die at an earlier age and cannot collect all of their benefits.

<p>[Note, this study is criticized because it did not factor in survivor's benefits and the costs to society of families losing a parent and relying more on social services to fill the gap.]

<p>Manhattan Institute for Policy Research Senior Fellow Peter Huber said, "Killing yourself by smoking incurs costs. ... But there are offsets.  It's quite possible that smokers are doing us all a small favor.  It's a ghoulish argument -- it's horrible -- but if you're going to have an economic case, you've got to use economics.  You can't use sentiment."

<p>Congressional Research Service economists Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman write that "the alternative to death from a smoking-related illness is not immortality and perfect health -- it is later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness."

<p>The Manning and Viscusi findings have their critics, many of whom cite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that show smoking's costs to be "several times higher." Others are bothered by the overall argument about smoking's costs to society.  MIT economist Jeffrey Harris "said the real danger is to suggest that government weigh the savings from early deaths in making public policy decisions."  He noted that Viscusi's study does not include "a key benefit to our society:  We value life."

<center><h3><a name=aa17>San Francisco Files its Own "Medicaid" Suit</a></h3></a></center>


San Francisco, CA May 16, 1996. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors Health, Public Safety and Environment committee today passed a resolution calling on the city to file a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry to seek payment of health care costs associated with smoking-related diseases.

<p>Supervisor Angela Alioto's resolution will be acted on by the full board within two weeks, according to AP, which also says SF Mayor Willie Brown "is expected to sign the measure." Alioto told AP that 23 other counties in California would join the suit.

<p>In the topsy-turvy world of California politics, the characters grow more interesting all the time:

<p>PETE WILSON

<p>Last year California Governor Pete Wilson signed the country's most sweeping statewide smoking restrictions. He also appointed as his presidential campaign chairman Craig Fuller, then senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris. For the last few years, Wilson has been in a fierce battle with tobacco control advocates as he has sought to gut the voter-approved Proposition 99 funds for tobacco education. Among Wilson's allies--the California Medical Association.

<p>KIMBERLY BELSHE

<p>In December of 1993, Wilson appointed Kimberly Belshe--the chief Southern California tobacco spokesperson against Proposition 99--to head the Department of Health Services, which runs the program. Yet in October of 1994, Belshe fought to save the disputed "I believe nicotine is not addictive" Prop. 99 ad, which had been called libelous by lawyers for then-RJR head James Johnston. Belshe strongly vilified the "strong-arm tactics" she said RJR lawyers were using to intimidate stations from running the ad.

<p>WILLIE BROWN

<p>When San Francisco, Mayor Willie Brown was State Assembly speaker, he was known as "the Marlboro Man," and in at least one year reportedly accepted more tobacco funds than any other politician in the country--including Virginia Rep. Thomas Bliley.

<center><h3><a name=aa18>LAWSUITS: Woman Can Sue Supermarket for Youth Sales--Appeals Court</a></h3></a></center></h3>

San Francisco, CA. June 29, 1996. A state appeals court today allowed a woman to sue a store chain for selling cigarettes to minors.

<p><i>[California's] unfair competition statute provides that enforcement actions may be brought by the state attorney general, any district attorney, any city attorney, a city prosecutor 'or by any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public,</i> ruled the 1st District Court of Appeals, overturning a lower court's decision by a vote of 3-0.

<p>The "person acting for the interests of ... the general public" is Carol Levy, of Stop Youth Addiction, a one-woman corporation, according to UPI. Her son, Donald Driscoll is the attorney handling the suit. Levy's husband died of lung cancer in the 60s.

<p>SYA's suit was filed against Lucky Stores, Inc., a supermarket chain. The suit seeks $10 billion restitution of profits from illegal sales to minors, an injunction against further sales, and attorney's fees.

<p>"When you walk into Lucky's with a check, they're very careful [about checking ID] because they could lose money. When you walk in saying you're 18 they don't care.," said Driscoll.

<p>The suit arose out of a sting operation Levy organized in 1994. The 100 other stores caught in the sting agreed to settle by signing a contract promising not to sell cigarettes to minors, and in some cases by also paying as much as $100 a day for SYA's legal fees.

<p>Lucky refused.

<p>In response to the ruling, a Lucky lawyer said: "Lucky and several other stores do not believe it is appropriate for a private profit-making corporation to hire minors to violate the law so that he can sue to recover attorneys fees. . .  Lucky believes very strongly that the enforcement of California's penal code provisions properly rests with California prosecutors, particularly in this case where prosecutors are not permitted to bring a lawsuit . . . unless they comply with very strict procedures."

<p>Lucky claims it has strict procedures in place--including a cigarette cabinet which must be unlocked with each sale, and which each time reminds the clerk to check for ID. Lucky will appeal to California's Supreme Court.

<li>TALLAHASSEE, FL. May 29, 1996: Florida State Circuit Judge Harold Cohen set trial for August 4, 1997 for the state's $1.4 billion "Medicaid" suit, and lifted a stay on the taking of depositions.
<li>NEW ORLEANS, LA. May 23, 1996. CASTANO: A three-judge appeals panel today agreed with tobacco industry lawyers that a class action of 50 million smokers would be too unwieldy to move through the court, and voided a previous judge's certification. The panel ruled that the issues involved (addiction and the industry's knowledge of smoking's effects) are too new and too weighty to be decided all at once for every smoker in the country, and would be better worked out in state venues. The original plaintiffs may still proceed, and Castano lawyers had in fact prepared a "Plan B". Lawyers will begin immediately filing state-level suits. LIggett indicated it will still abide by the terms of its settlement.  Tobacco stocks soared on the news.

<p><li>NEW ORLEANS, LA. May 12, 1996. CASTANO: Plaintiffs in the class action suit filed a motion for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement reached with Liggett Tobacco on March 12, 1996. No date for a fairness hearing on the matter has been set.
<p><li>May 3, 1996. INDIANA CLASS ACTION: A class action suit was filed against tobacco companies on behalf of all Indiana residents who allege addiction to nicotine.

<p><li>TALLAHASSEE, FL. 5/10/96. Tobacco defendants' motions for rehearing were denied by the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Florida in two class action lawsuits. The defendants were seeking decertification of both classes:

<ul><li>BROIN V. PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES, INC., involves non-smoking flight attendants who work or have worked for U.S. airlines and allege injuries from exposure to ETS.

<li>ENGLE V. R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY involves plaintiffs who are Florida citizens and residents who claim they have become addicted to cigarette smoke and have suffered injuries as a result. </ul>

<p>Defendants intend to appeal both decisions to the Florida Supreme Court.

<p><li>5/1/96 MARYLAND MEDICAID SUIT: Maryland became the 8th state to file a "Medicaid" suit against the tobacco industry today, and the first to charge the industry deceptively and fraudulently targeted minorities through the use of inner-city billboards.. The suit will be handled by Baltimore Orioles part-owner PETER ANGELOS, who made his fortune representing workers in asbestos-related lawsuits. RJ Reynolds said cigarette taxes more than cover any smoking-related health-care costs.

<p><li>5/1/96 CONNECTICUT MEDICAID SUIT: Connecticut's attorney-general Richard Blumenthal said Connecticut plans to file a "Medicaid" suit against the tobacco industry, probably by early summer.

<center><h3><a name=aa19>ART: San Diego Museum Cancels PM Sponsorship</a></h3></center></a>

San Diego, CA. May 1, 1996 The San Diego Museum of Art has canceled Philip Morris' sponsorship of a summer exhibit of life-size sculptures of wild horses--a subject emblematic of PM's "Marlboro" brand--which would have run during the Philip Morris-sponsored Republican convention in San Diego (Aug. 12-15), and been the focus of receptions and events. The exhibition is now at risk, as no alternate sponsor has been found.

<p>The show's sculptor, Deborah Butterfield, had previously told the LA Times that her father had died at 63 of heart disease aggravated by his smoking, and that she was uncomfortable with the PM sponsorship, but the museum had told her no other sponsors were available. 

<p>"I really have to lay down with the devil to do this but . . . you know, you make choices," Butterfield told the Times. Now that the museum has reponded to the calls of protest it received, it is hoping the community will help.

<p>It is the second area event which has snubbed Philip Morris' sponsorship. Last month, Del Mar Fair Board canceled its arrangement to let PM sell Marlboros at the "Fiesta Latino Day."

<p>The art world has experienced an unprecedented distancing of artists from Philip Morris sponsorship recently. Protests were made at "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art," exhibits in New York and California last year.  Adrian Piper withdrew her work, saying she'd be glad to hang portraits of her parents who died of tobacco-related diseases instead. Long-time tobacco industry critic Hans Haacke hung a "disclaimer" next to his work. 10 other artists in the show also protested, including Sol LeWitt, Yvonne Rainer and Victor Burgin.

<center><h3><a name=aa20>Writer Slams Magazines on Tobacco Ads</a></h3></a></center>

Boston, MA. May 10, 1996. Today's Boston Globe carried an article titled "Sound of Silence on Tobacco Ads" by staff writer Derrick Z. Jackson, who searched recent popular magazines for articles on health, and found no mention of the number one preventable cause of death (smoking) in any that carried tobacco ads.

<p>Jackson cited the 1992  study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that magazines that did not accept cigarette ads were 40 percent more likely to have articles on the dangers of smoking.

<p>One example he cited: "The cover of the May 13 Fortune was devoted to men battling prostate cancer. But the call to fight lung cancer, which is as simple as refusing to pick up a cigarette, is close to nonexistent"

<p>Other magazines Jackson mentioned that had health articles, but nothing on tobacco were:

<li>Elle
<li>Family Circle
<li>First for Women
<li>Harper's Bazaar
<li>Ladies Home Journal
<li>Mademoiselle
<li>McCall's
<li>Mirabella
<li>New Woman
<li>Swing
<li>Women's World

<p>Besides buying silence on tobacco issues, Jackson said such ads buy legitimacy. With ads prominently displayed in other popular magazines like People, Time, Sports Illustrated, Life, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Spin, Hot Rod, Motor Trend, Sport, New York and Premiere, Jackson said, "you can understand why . . . many teen-agers see smoking as legitimate."

<p><i>Magazines publishers who accept ads from tobacco,</i> Jackson concluded, <i>do not have the courage to say the profits are picked up over someone's dead body.</i>

<center><h3><a name=aa21>PEOPLE: Herb Caen Has Inoperable Lung Cancer</a></h3></a></center>


May 30, 1996. San Francisco's most beloved columnist, Herb Caen, told his readers today he has inoperable lung cancer.

<p>In explaining his column's uncharacteristically sporadic appearances in the San Francisco Chronicle, he said, "I do wish I could have told you that my long silences were indeed due to The World's Greatest Hangover." </p>

<p>After disclosing how his doctor found a "pigeon-egg" sized tumor on his right lung, Caen, 80,  said, "To answer your next question, no, I don't smoke but I did for about 40 years, with no blips on the X-rays. I quit cold turkey some 25 years ago, but the specialists simply shrug off this kind of information. And so, in a lightning flash, I passed from the land of the well to the world of the unwell, where I will now dwell for what I hope is a long time.''</p>

<p>"My life is now controlled by a dream team of specialists, who keep my once-pristine medicine cabinet stocked with pills -- the cabinet that once contained nothing more medical than Band-Aids. Old ones. Foolish pride: I considered myself indestructible," he wrote.</p>

<p>Caen said his chemotherapy would limit his future columns to three-a-week, at most.</p>

<p>"The Sackamenna  Kid" (Sacramento, where he was born in 1916) fell hopelessly in love with "The City" on a visit when a child, moved there in 1936, and has been writing a daily column of opinion, puns, and area gossip and arcana for almost 60 years, since 1938. He was diagnosed 5 weeks ago.</p>

<p>In just the last 2 months:</p>

<ul>
<li>He was awarded a special Pulitzer award for his "extraordinary and continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of his city."</li> 

<li>He married his long-time girl friend Ann Moller (his fourth marriage).</li> 

<li>The name of the Embarcadero Promenade was changed to "Herb Caen Way."</li> 

</ul>
<p>In 1986, Caen reported on "high-school age kids gleefully grabbing for free Yves St. Laurent perfumed ciggies being handed out on street corners" with no apparent requests for identification.</p>

<p>More recently, he supported his close friend Willie Brown for Mayor of SF, saying, "What you see is all the flash and dash, but what you get is a caring, hard-working, smart, honest, brilliant, wonderful man." Brown is known to others as the "Marlboro Man" for the extraordinary amount of money he received from tobacco interests when he was speaker of the California Assembly.</p>

<center><h3><a name=aa22>PEOPLE: Morton Downey, with Lung Cancer, to Fight Tobacco</a></h3></a></center>

New York, NY. June 18, 1996. Morton Downey, Jr., the outspoken, chain-smoking talk-show-host-turned-pro-tobacco-advocate has revealed he has lung cancer, and will begin an anti-smoking campaign aimed at kids.

<p>Downey, 63, a former 3-4-pach-a-day smoker, told Reuters, "Just because I've been foolish in not listening to medical warnings about the dangers of smoking, doesn't mean that I shouldn't deliver a strong anti-smoking message to today's youth in their own vernacular."

<p>Downey plans a TV special called, "Tough Guy," according to AP, at the end of which a kid is being pressured to smoke. With an appropriate gesture, the kid responds, "Smoke this!."

<p>Only last January, Downey was a board member of the National Smokers Alliance. He quit, he said, when he "realized that the major tobacco companies were lying when they said they weren't adding dangerous levels of nicotine to cigarette tobacco. They're nothing but tobacco terrorists."

<p>Reuters said Downey was due to "undergo surgery on his right lung" within weeks.

<p>Downey pioneered the modern era of "shock TV" with his syndicated "The Morton Downey, Jr. Show" in the late 1980s.

<center><h3><a name=aa23><i>Exeunt Omnes:</i> RJR's Johnston is Last of the Tobacco 7 to Exit Business</a></h3></a></center>

<i>I'm considering Friday the first day of my new, more balanced life. Over those seven years . . . I pushed off the people and things that I love in order to meet the constant demands of the job. I finally decided it was time to put my life back in balance.</i>

<p>Winston-Salem, NC. June 28, 1996 James R. Johnston, vice- chairman and director of RJR Nabisco Holdings and CEO of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Worldwide, retired today.

<p>Johnston is the last of the 7 tobacco executives who testified before Congress in April, 1994 to resign from the business. Analysts say the departure of so many top executives in any industry in so short a time--2 years and 2 months--is extremely unusual.

<p>Johnston had worked for RJR in the early eighties, but was at CitiBank when asked in 1989 to head the domestic tobacco arm of debt-laden RJR, which had just been the subject of a $29 Billion LBO, and had seen the humiliating failure of its "smokeless" cigarette, <i>Premier.</i> Under his tenure, morale improved, but RJR's tobacco business remained stagnant, firmly in second place behind titan Philip Morris.

<p>What market gains the company made came primarily from the success of its expensively promoted Camel brand--which led in turn to a continuing barrage of criticism of the campaign, which was accused of targeting youth. Johnston gained national attention at the 1994 Waxman hearings, and was the only executive to talk with Ted Koppel on Nightline.

<p>Johnston indicated that after 7 years tending to a business in perpetual crisis, he wanted to spend more time with his wife Beverly and two daughters. Johnston's only son, Michael, 18, shot and killed himself in his bedroom in February, 1995.

<p>Andrew J. Schindler, head of U.S. operations, and Pierre de Labouchere, head of the international unit will now report directly to RJR Nabisco chairman and CEO Steven Goldstone--who only last May succeeded Charles M. Harper.

<h4><a name=aa24>SIDEBAR: THE HISTORIC 1994 CONGRESSIONAL APPEARANCE</a></h4>
The tobacco company executives who appeared before Henry Waxman's (D-CA) House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment beginning April 14, 1994, were (from left to right in the famous photo):

<p><li>Donald S. Johnston, president and CEO of American Tobacco Company 
<br>Johnston retired December 22, 1994 when ATC was acquired by Brown & Williamson Tobacco. Johnston had been with ATC since January 6, 1986; he had previously worked for Brown & Williamson Tobacco from October 23, 1965 until January, 1985. Johnston said ATC "has no desire or intent to manipulate nicotine."
<ul>QUOTE: [N]othing is done in the tobacco processing or manufacture of cigarettes or filters by the American Tobacco Co. to increase nicotine beyond that naturally occurring in tobacco . . . American has no desire or intent to 'manipulate' nicotine.</ul>

<p><li>Thomas Sandefur Jr., chairman and CEO of Brown and William Tobacco Corporation
<br> Sandefur left B&W at age 55 in June, 1995; the company cited medical reasons; Sandefur was reported to have a rare blood disease.

<p><li>Edward A. Horrigan, chairman and CEO of Liggett Group Inc. 
<br>Horrigan gave up his CEO position in June, 1994, and his chairmanship on Dec. 31, 1994. He had only been with Liggett for about a year when he testified; he was a major RJR management figure in the leveraged buyout of the company in 1989.
<ul>QUOTE: It is outrageous for you to assume that we (tobacco industry heads) meet and talk about this issue. . .  They are competitors, not conspirators.</ul>

<p><li>Andrew H. Tisch, chairman and CEO Lorillard Tobacco Company
<br>Tisch left both positions May 31, 1995 to take an expanded role at Lorillard's parent company, Loews Corp., which the Tisch family runs.
<ul>QUOTE: Lorillard does not take any steps to assure a minimal level of nicotine in our products.</ul>

<p><li>Joseph Taddeo, president of United States Tobacco Company
<br>Taddeo's resignation, said to be due to disappointing sales and disagreements with management at parent UST Inc., was announced in June, 1995.
<ul>QUOTES:
<li>U.S. Tobacco believes that no ingredient which it adds to tobacco in the manufacture of its smokeless tobacco products would result in adverse health consequences to a consumer of our product 
<li>Oral tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer
<li>Without revealing proprietary information, I can tell you that every ingredient which U.S. Tobacco adds to tobacco in the manufacture of its products is a common food item or approved for use in food, with the single exception of (an approved ingredient) for use in the manufacture of tobacco products
<li>Oral tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer</ul>

<p><li>James W. Johnston, CEO of R.J. Reynolds.
<br>Johston retired June 28, 1996.
<ul>QUOTES:
<li>If I thought that ad (the Joe Camel campaign) caused any young people to begin smoking, I'd pull it in a heartbeat
<li>Would you rather board a plane with a pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills?
<li>We do not do anything to hook smokers or keep them hooked. . . We no more manipulate nicotine in cigarettes than coffee makers manipulate caffeine. . . but no one is suggesting the FDA regulate coffee, cola or tea as drugs.
<li>Don't you think there are 45 million Americans who resent being characterized as helpless, pathetic addicts? You can characterize smokers as addicts, like some of these gentlemen did today, but common sense tells you they are not. My God, I'm no addict. I smoke. I've just been through a long day. You didn't see me biting a hole in this table, did you?
<li>If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold, then ban them. Some smokers will obey the law, but many will not. People will be selling cigarettes out of the trunks of cars, cigarettes made by who knows who, made of who knows what.
<li>The goal of the anti-smoking industry is to bring back prohibition.
<li>WAXMAN: "Does smoking cause heart disease?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may
<br>WAXMAN: Does it cause lung cancer?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may
<br>WAXMAN: Emphysema?
<br>JOHNSTON: It may.</ul>

<p><li>William I. Campbell, CEO, Philip Morris USA
<br>Campbell retired in June, 1995 at 51; in September, 1995, he was hired to teach business courses at the University of Richmond; in January, 1996, he was hired to run Citicorp's branch banking operations worldwide as executive vice president for retail banking operations.
<ul>QUOTES: 
<li>Philip Morris does not manipulate nor independently control the level of nicotine in our products. . . . Cigarettes contain nicotine because it occurs naturally in tobacco. Nicotine contributes to the taste of cigarettes and the pleasures of smoking. . . When creating a cigarette for a tar category, we select a particular tobacco blend and flavors to provide 'uniqueness' to the product. So how do we manipulate or independently control nicotine as our critics charge? The answer is we don't. We accept the nicotine levels that result from this process.
<li>Smokers are not drug users or addicts, and we do not appreciate being characterized as such.</ul>

<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS THE FAMOUS "ADDICTION" EXCHANGE:</strong>

<p>REP. WYDEN: Let me ask you first, and I'd like to just go down the row, whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive. I've heard virtually all of you touch on it--yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
<br>WILLIAM I. CAMPBELL (Philip Morris): I believe that nicotine is not addictive, yes.
<br>REP. WYDEN: Mr. Johnson...
<br>JAMES JOHNSTON (RJ Reynolds): Uh, Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definition of addiction. There is no intoxication--
<br>REP. WYDEN: We'll take that as a no. And again, time is short, if you can just, I think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive, I'd just like to have this for the record.
<br>JOSEPH TADDEO (US Tobacco): I don't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.
<br>ANDREW TISCH (P Lorillard): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>EDWARD HORRIGAN (Liggett Group): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>THOMAS SANDEFUR (Brown & Williamson): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
<br>DONALD JOHNSTON (American Tobacco Co.): And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive.

<center><h3><a name=aa25>OBIT: American Brands Director Alley, 66, Commits Suicide</a></h3></a></center></h3>

New Canaan, CT. July 26, 1996. William J. Alley, who was chairman and CEO of American Brands in 1994 when the diversified company announced its intention to sell its American Tobacco unit to Brown & Williamson, committed suicide in his home today, according to police.

<p>Alley came into tobacco from the life insurance business. He was chairman of Franklin Life when the company was acquired by American Brands in 1979, and was named CEO of American Brands in May, 1987. He was still CEO in April, 1994, when Donald Johnston, president of American's tobacco unit, told Henry Waxman's Congressional subcommittee, "And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive."

<p>At the time of his death, Alley was a director of American Brands. He was also serving as a director of Olin Corp., Amsted Industries Inc., Central Illinois Public Service Co., Cipsco Inc. and Rayonier Inc..

<p>He is survived by his wife, Deborah, and 5 children.

<p>Two other prominent tobacco figures died this month: Thomas Sanderfur (July 15, 1996), the Brown & Williamson CEO who testified in 1994, and former Brown & Williamson General Counsel Addison Yeaman (88, July 7, 1996), who wrote, "we are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms."

<h3><a name=aa26>NEW WEB SITES</a></h3>


<h3><a name=aa27>THE FUNNY PAGES</a></h3>


CBS-TV's "48 Hours," April 10, 1996, featured a segment on Dennis Parone's "Cannabis Buyer's Club" in San Francisco. One shot focused on a handwritten sign hanging above the sales counter: 

<p>
<strong><blockquote>Thank you for POT smoking.
<br>PLEASE do NOT smoke tobacco here.</blockquote></strong>

The US Tobacco Company has announced that between now and Dec. 31 it will donate a portion of its sales--at least $1M--to the National Volunteer Fire Council. In return US Tobacco asked that for the rest of the year, everyone pretend that cigarettes don't cause cancer.
<br>--Norm MacDonald, Saturday Night Live, May 11, 1996

<p>A secret R.J. Reynolds marketing report in 1984 stressed the importance of selling cigarettes to young people to "replace" other smokers. Says the Cutler Daily Scoop, "Fortunately, plans for a 'Nicotine at Nite' cable channel fell through." 
<br>--Los Angeles Times, July 12, 1996

<p>Jay Leno offered this plot for Independence Day II: ``Bob Dole is president. He convinces the aliens that smoking is safe. They all get emphysema and die."

<li>The May/June Mother Jones magazine is probably the most complete baring of the tobacco/money/politics situation the country has seen yet. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com"> "Tobacco Strikes Back" </a> examines unashamedly (Mojo doesn't take tobacco ads) the reality of Big Tobacco's influence in the media and politics. Articles include:
<ul><li>Marlboro's Man--Bob Dole's tobacco connections.
<li><i>Tobacco Under Fire, </i>the 1994 documentary ABC cancelled the day it was slapped with a multi-billion lawsuit by Philip Morris.
<li>Smoked Out (ABC and CBS's capitulations to tobacco, corporate and congressional interests.)
<li>Mojo's 1979 expose on smoking, for which tobacco, and in solidarity, liquor companies pulled several years' worth of ads.</ul>

<H2>SECRET DOCUMENTS REVEAL A.C.L.U. TOBACCO INDUSTRY TIES</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>NY Coalition for a Smoke-Free City</P>

<P>FOR RELEASE: WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1996</P>

<P>MEDIA ADVISORY</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER, 13th, AT 10 A.M.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Secret memos detailing how the American Civil Liberties Union
works as a hired gun for the Tobacco Industry will be revealed at a
press conference on Wednesday, November 13th, 10 a.m, at 132 West
43rd Street (bet. 6th &amp; Broadway), outside the A.C.L.U.. For the
first time, the memos expose an intentional A.C.L.U. cover-up of a
quid pro quo - direct work for funding - relationship with Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds, the world's two largest tobacco
manufacturers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The confidential documents detail how the A.C.L.U., the
76-year-old sacred cow of American liberalism and defender of the
Bill of Rights, has received over $1 million dollars in combined
funding from the two tobacco giants in exchange for aggressive
advocacy on their behalf. The A.C.L.U.'s work for cigarette company
donations is in direct conflict with its status as a tax-exempt,
non-profit institution.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Investigative journalist and former A.C.L.U. employee, John Fahs,
author of the Berkley Publishing Group's new book, CIGARETTE
CONFIDENTIAL: THE UNFILTERED TRUTH ABOUT THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN
ADDICTION, will distribute the internal A.C.L.U. documents at the
press conference. Joe Cherner, President of SmokeFree Educational
Services, will describe his experience with the A.C.L.U.'s refusal to
support non-smokers rights.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In 1993 major news headlines reported the A.C.L.U.'s acceptance of
cigarette money but the agency denied any link between funding and
their defense of tobacco industry issues. These secret memos not only
reveal a clear conflict of interest but also demonstrate a concerted
cover-up and campaign of disinformation after the acceptance of
cigarette money had been brought to light.</P>

<P>Statement of Melvin L. Wulf</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I was legal director of the national ACLU from 1962 to 1977. I
have practiced law in New York since that time. This is the first
critical word I've had to say publicly about the Union, to whose
principles I am still deeply attached I do so now because the
information in "Cigarette Confidential" about the receipt of large
amounts of money by the Union from the tobacco industry threatens the
basic integrity of the ACLU. The justification that the money is used
to support workplace rights is a sham. There is no constitutional
right of smokers to pollute the atmosphere and threaten the health of
others. The revelations in the book support the conclusion that the
ACLU's mission is being corrupted by the attraction of easy money
from an industry whose ethical values are themselves notoriously
corrupt and which is responsible for the death annually of 350,000 to
400,000 persons in the US alone. I am saddened by the fact that the
ACLU allows itself to be used in this manner. The ACLU board of
directors has an obligation to take stern steps to protect the Union
from further corruption of its values.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><HR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>REMARKS AT ACLU/TOBACCO TIES PRESS CONFERENCE</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>THEN (Before Tobacco Money)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose banning cigarette advertising on TV and
radio. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose warning labels on cigarette packages or
print ads.</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose prohibiting cigarette sales to minors. 
</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose smokefree workplace laws. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose nicotine being regulated as a drug. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose counter-advertising. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose tombstone advertising.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>NOW (After Tobacco Money)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU opposes FDA rules to regulate nicotine as a drug and
place restrictions on cigarette ads aimed at minors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU opposes legislation to prohibit or restrict tobacco
advertising and promotion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU opposes legislation for new, larger warning labels. The
ACLU opposes legislation that would strip the tax deductibility of
tobacco advertising. The ACLU opposes Congressman Waxman's smokefree
public places bill. The ACLU ignored employee pleas and a petition
for a smokefree workplace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU does not believe that tobacco advertising entices young
people to smoke.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU does not oppose life insurance companies discriminating
against smokers by charging them more for life insurance (three
tobacco companies own life insurance subsidiaries that charge smokers
more for life insurance).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU opposes campaign finance reform that would limit soft
money donations (tobacco companies rank among the largest soft money
donators).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU turned a blind eye to attempts by cigarette makers to
silence whistle blowers, such as Jeffrey Wigand. (Nadine Strossen
claims the ACLU doesn't have the resources).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU- NY Affiliate opposed New York City legislation to
require counter-advertising on all City property where tobacco is
advertised, even though the ACLU previously called for such
legislation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>-----------------------------------------------------------------
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>WHAT WE FIND MOST OFFENSIVE</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. The ACLU has taken over $1,000,000 in donations from the
tobacco cartel, while at the same time, allying itself with the
tobacco industry on capitol hill.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. Lew Maltby deceitfully writes to ACLU's supporters that "no
single donor contributes a significant portion of our income." Maltby
fails to mention that his smokers' rights department receives 90% of
its funding from the tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3. The ACLU refuses to tell its members that it solicits and
accepts tobacco money. In a memo to Ira Glasser, Jim Shields (of the
ACLU's North Carolina affiliate) shows the secrecy of tobacco money:
"My microfiche shows a September 1991 $1,000 RJR donation to ACLU-NJ
foundation. I imagine RJR forgot to ask for anonymity."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4. In a handwritten fax to Ira Glasser, Jim Shields displays the
necessity of tobacco money: "My affiliate will end up $30K in the red
this year if we do not receive the RJR support."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5. The ACLU refuses to open to the public or reporters portions of
its 1994 board of directors meeting pertaining to tobacco issues.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6. The ACLU's positions and rhetoric is almost identical to the
tobacco cartel's. One memo to Ira Glasser cites the need for
"effective slogans" and "pithy phrases." As code words for smokers'
rights, both groups use "workplace privacy" and "lifestyle choices."
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7. For 3 years, the ACLU has refused to answer our questions about
their positions on a number of tobacco related issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8. Lew Maltby flew to Copenhagen on the tobacco industry's behalf
to attend a smokers' rights convention.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9. Lew Maltby flew to Winston Salem on a corporate jet to meet
with five RJR executives for a formal strategy session about
coordinating ACLU/RJR efforts. After his trip, Maltby writes Glasser,
"The discussions were very candid. I explained my belief that
smokers' rights is a losing issue and must be broadened into a
general campaign to protect people's privacy... "</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>10. Lew Maltby lobbied ACLU affiliates on commercial freedom of
speech issues which was out of his workplace task-force jurisdiction.
In a memo to Glasser, Maltby writes, "Josh Slavit of Philip Morris
recently called me to discuss the possibility of increasing the
ACLU's involvement with defending commercial speech... PM would be
willing to provide funding for such a program. This would be in
addition to our ongoing funding for workplace privacy. They provided
the funding for our Mississippi affiliate's recent conference on free
speech."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11. Lew Maltby appealed to his North Carolina affiliate to ask a
North Carolina state senator to write a letter to Philip Morris
praising the ACLU for it work on behalf of smokers' rights. Maltby
felt that such a letter would be influential in securing additional
funding.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>12. Lew Maltby constantly meets with tobacco representatives to
coordinate State efforts for passing smokers' rights legislation.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>13. Invoices for conferences, newspaper ads, radio ads, and
fulfillment of ad responses are constantly forwarded by the ACLU to
Philip Morris</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>14. The ACLU ignored our repeated attempt to ascertain its
position on Henry Waxman's smokefree workplace bill. In a memo to Ira
Glasser, Maltby states, " I put in a call to PM's Washington
office... (I didn't want to raise our profile by calling Waxman's
office)."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>15. The ACLU claims that no one influences its agenda, but tobacco
companies frequently controlled the agendas at brainstorming meetings
with Lew Maltby.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>16. The ACLU held strategy seminars for local affiliates and
allies on smokers' rights issues and submitted vouchers to Philip
Morris for reimbursement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>17. The ACLU allowed Philip Morris to produce a solicitation
brochure for Philip Morris' mailing list. The brochure, entitled
"Should the people who run your office tell you how to run your
life," never mentioned Philip Morris' name and used the ACLU's return
address for contributions and literature. In a memo to Ira Glasser,
Lew Maltby writes in favor of the campaign, "Philip Morris provides
no general contributions to the ACLU. .. This is a golden opportunity
to raise badly needed funds. We should capitalize on it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>18. The ACLU's relationship with the tobacco cartel is too cozy.
The ACLU has rolled out the red carpet for the tobacco industry and
has given it first class treatment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>19. The ACLU has tried to get as much money as possible from the
tobacco cartel and even considered compromising its ideas to get more
money.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>20. The ACLU's board of directors includes lawyers from firms
representing tobacco companies in wrongful death suits, publicity,
and other tobacco related matters. Clearly, this is a conflict of
interests.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>21. On several occasions, Glasser suggests using the ACLU's
relationship with Board Member David Waxse to open doors at Philip
Morris. Waxse works for Philip Morris' main legal firm in wrongful
death suits, and, according to Glasser, has great relationships with
Chuck Wahl and Steve Parrish (Philip Morris' in house legal chiefs).
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>22. The ACLU claims that none of its tobacco money is for issues
directly related to tobacco company interests, while memos show funds
specifically earmarked by Philip Morris for seminars on smokers'
rights.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>23. Glasser claims that the ACLU "never seeks or accepts fees for
its services." Internal memos show that the ACLU sought and accepted
tobacco money for specific tobacco related projects. It even
submitted invoices and expense vouchers to the tobacco giants.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>24. Glasser and Maltby constantly made misleading statements to
the press and its members about the ACLU's close relationship to the
tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>25. RJR agreed to fund an ACLU public opinion research project for
$450,000. Ira Glasser claims that the research has no connection to
tobacco-related issue, but American Talk Issues (the company hired to
do the research) backed out because "this simultaneous advocacy of
smokers' rights and the acceptance of RJR's grant will have very
unfortunate public relations ramifications. At the very least, it
puts a cloud over ACLU's status as an objective crusader for
individual human rights, rather than just another lance for hire."
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>26. Philip Morris scheduled Lew Maltby to meet with a Japanese
journalist interested in the issue of smoking in America. Philip
Morris set the agenda and a secretary wrote to Maltby, "I would like
to know if you have any favorites (restaurants) before booking a
reservation."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU has been caught with its hands in the cookie jar. It
appears that the ACLU has changed a number of its positions on
tobacco related issues since the acceptance of tobacco money. Lew
Maltby and Ira Glasser frequently discuss ways for the ACLU to get
more tobacco money. Maltby has become so addicted to tobacco money
that he even contemplates further bending of ACLU positions to
accommodate the tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In a memo to Sandy Sedacca (ACLU Fundraising Dept.), Maltby writes
that Philip Morris wants a report from him describing ACLU
"accomplishments... " "in terms of smoking restrictions." Maltby
adds, "I will have a rough draft completed by the end of the week."
Later in the memo, Maltby asks, "To what extent are we prepared to
expand our definition of the issue? PM would clearly love to have us
take a position that people should be able to smoke at work and in
public buildings. . . If we were to do so, it would have a
significant impact on their (funding) decision..."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Rather than ask what is the proper decision, Maltby writes, "The
crucial question, however, is whether the benefits of taking an
expanded position are worth the costs. We have taken a great deal of
heat over our present position. The reaction to an expanded position
would be far worse."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lew Malt by's department would be out of business if not for
tobacco cartel funds. As Maltby, himself, writes in a thank you
letter to Philip Morris, "As you know, this is not the type of
glamorous issue that attracts major donors... "</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the ACLU wants to continue fighting for the tobacco cartel, it
should immediately cease the acceptance of tobacco money.</P>

from an industry whose ethical values are themselves notoriously
corrupt and which is responsible for the death annually of 350,000 to
400,000 persons in the US alone. I am saddened by the fact that the
ACLU allows itself to be used in this manner. The ACLU board of
directors has an obligation to take stern steps to protect the Union
from further corruption of its values.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>REMARKS AT ACLU/TOBACCO TIES PRESS CONFERENCE</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>THEN (Before Tobacco Money)</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose banning cigarette advertising on TV and
radio. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose warning labels on cigarette packages or
print ads.</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose prohibiting cigarette sales to minors. 
</P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose smokefree workplace laws. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose nicotine being regulated as a drug. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose counter-advertising. </P>

<P>The ACLU did not oppose tombstone advertising.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>NOW (After Tobacco Money)</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU opposes FDA rules to regulate nicotine as a drug and
place restrictions on cigarette ads aimed at minors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU opposes legislation to prohibit or restrict tobacco
advertising and promotion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU opposes legislation for new, larger warning labels. The
ACLU opposes legislation that would strip the tax deductibility of
tobacco advertising. The ACLU opposes Congressman Waxman's smokefree
public places bill. The ACLU ignored employee pleas and a petition
for a smokefree workplace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> The ACLU does not believe that tobacco advertising entices young
people to smoke.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU does not oppose life insurance companies discriminating
against smokers by charging them more for life insurance (three
tobacco companies own life insurance subsidiaries that charge smokers
more for life insurance).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU opposes campaign finance reform that would limit soft
money donations (tobacco companies rank among the largest soft money
donators).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU turned a blind eye to attempts by cigarette makers to
silence whistle blowers, such as Jeffrey Wigand. (Nadine Strossen
claims the ACLU doesn't have the resources).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU- NY Affiliate opposed New York City legislation to
require counter-advertising on all City property where tobacco is
advertised, even though the ACLU previously called for such
legislation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>-----------------------------------------------------------------
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>WHAT WE FIND MOST OFFENSIVE</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. The ACLU has taken over $1,000,000 in donations from the
tobacco cartel, while at the same time, allying itself with the
tobacco industry on capitol hill.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. Lew Maltby deceitfully writes to ACLU's supporters that "no
single donor contributes a significant portion of our income." Maltby
fails to mention that his smokers' rights department receives 90% of
its funding from the tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3. The ACLU refuses to tell its members that it solicits and
accepts tobacco money. In a memo to Ira Glasser, Jim Shields (of the
ACLU's North Carolina affiliate) shows the secrecy of tobacco money:
"My microfiche shows a September 1991 $1,000 RJR donation to ACLU-NJ
foundation. I imagine RJR forgot to ask for anonymity."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4. In a handwritten fax to Ira Glasser, Jim Shields displays the
necessity of tobacco money: "My affiliate will end up $30K in the red
this year if we do not receive the RJR support."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>5. The ACLU refuses to open to the public or reporters portions of
its 1994 board of directors meeting pertaining to tobacco issues.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>6. The ACLU's positions and rhetoric is almost identical to the
tobacco cartel's. One memo to Ira Glasser cites the need for
"effective slogans" and "pithy phrases." As code words for smokers'
rights, both groups use "workplace privacy" and "lifestyle choices."
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>7. For 3 years, the ACLU has refused to answer our questions about
their positions on a number of tobacco related issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>8. Lew Maltby flew to Copenhagen on the tobacco industry's behalf
to attend a smokers' rights convention.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9. Lew Maltby flew to Winston Salem on a corporate jet to meet
with five RJR executives for a formal strategy session about
coordinating ACLU/RJR efforts. After his trip, Maltby writes Glasser,
"The discussions were very candid. I explained my belief that
smokers' rights is a losing issue and must be broadened into a
general campaign to protect people's privacy... "</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>10. Lew Maltby lobbied ACLU affiliates on commercial freedom of
speech issues which was out of his workplace task-force jurisdiction.
In a memo to Glasser, Maltby writes, "Josh Slavit of Philip Morris
recently called me to discuss the possibility of increasing the
ACLU's involvement with defending commercial speech... PM would be
willing to provide funding for such a program. This would be in
addition to our ongoing funding for workplace privacy. They provided
the funding for our Mississippi affiliate's recent conference on free
speech."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11. Lew Maltby appealed to his North Carolina affiliate to ask a
North Carolina state senator to write a letter to Philip Morris
praising the ACLU for it work on behalf of smokers' rights. Maltby
felt that such a letter would be influential in securing additional
funding.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>12. Lew Maltby constantly meets with tobacco representatives to
coordinate State efforts for passing smokers' rights legislation.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>13. Invoices for conferences, newspaper ads, radio ads, and
fulfillment of ad responses are constantly forwarded by the ACLU to
Philip Morris</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>14. The ACLU ignored our repeated attempt to ascertain its
position on Henry Waxman's smokefree workplace bill. In a memo to Ira
Glasser, Maltby states, " I put in a call to PM's Washington
office... (I didn't want to raise our profile by calling Waxman's
office)."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>15. The ACLU claims that no one influences its agenda, but tobacco
companies frequently controlled the agendas at brainstorming meetings
with Lew Maltby.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>16. The ACLU held strategy seminars for local affiliates and
allies on smokers' rights issues and submitted vouchers to Philip
Morris for reimbursement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>17. The ACLU allowed Philip Morris to produce a solicitation
brochure for Philip Morris' mailing list. The brochure, entitled
"Should the people who run your office tell you how to run your
life," never mentioned Philip Morris' name and used the ACLU's return
address for contributions and literature. In a memo to Ira Glasser,
Lew Maltby writes in favor of the campaign, "Philip Morris provides
no general contributions to the ACLU. .. This is a golden opportunity
to raise badly needed funds. We should capitalize on it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>18. The ACLU's relationship with the tobacco cartel is too cozy.
The ACLU has rolled out the red carpet for the tobacco industry and
has given it first class treatment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>19. The ACLU has tried to get as much money as possible from the
tobacco cartel and even considered compromising its ideas to get more
money.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>20. The ACLU's board of directors includes lawyers from firms
representing tobacco companies in wrongful death suits, publicity,
and other tobacco related matters. Clearly, this is a conflict of
interests.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>21. On several occasions, Glasser suggests using the ACLU's
relationship with Board Member David Waxse to open doors at Philip
Morris. Waxse works for Philip Morris' main legal firm in wrongful
death suits, and, according to Glasser, has great relationships with
Chuck Wahl and Steve Parrish (Philip Morris' in house legal chiefs).
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>22. The ACLU claims that none of its tobacco money is for issues
directly related to tobacco company interests, while memos show funds
specifically earmarked by Philip Morris for seminars on smokers'
rights.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>23. Glasser claims that the ACLU "never seeks or accepts fees for
its services." Internal memos show that the ACLU sought and accepted
tobacco money for specific tobacco related projects. It even
submitted invoices and expense vouchers to the tobacco giants.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>24. Glasser and Maltby constantly made misleading statements to
the press and its members about the ACLU's close relationship to the
tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>25. RJR agreed to fund an ACLU public opinion research project for
$450,000. Ira Glasser claims that the research has no connection to
tobacco-related issue, but American Talk Issues (the company hired to
do the research) backed out because "this simultaneous advocacy of
smokers' rights and the acceptance of RJR's grant will have very
unfortunate public relations ramifications. At the very least, it
puts a cloud over ACLU's status as an objective crusader for
individual human rights, rather than just another lance for hire."
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>26. Philip Morris scheduled Lew Maltby to meet with a Japanese
journalist interested in the issue of smoking in America. Philip
Morris set the agenda and a secretary wrote to Maltby, "I would like
to know if you have any favorites (restaurants) before booking a
reservation."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The ACLU has been caught with its hands in the cookie jar. It
appears that the ACLU has changed a number of its positions on
tobacco related issues since the acceptance of tobacco money. Lew
Maltby and Ira Glasser frequently discuss ways for the ACLU to get
more tobacco money. Maltby has become so addicted to tobacco money
that he even contemplates further bending of ACLU positions to
accommodate the tobacco cartel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In a memo to Sandy Sedacca (ACLU Fundraising Dept.), Maltby writes
that Philip Morris wants a report from him describing ACLU
"accomplishments... " "in terms of smoking restrictions." Maltby
adds, "I will have a rough draft completed by the end of the week."
Later in the memo, Maltby asks, "To what extent are we prepared to
expand our definition of the issue? PM would clearly love to have us
take a position that people should be able to smoke at work and in
public buildings. . . If we were to do so, it would have a
significant impact on their (funding) decision..."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Rather than ask what is the proper decision, Maltby writes, "The
crucial question, however, is whether the benefits of taking an
expanded position are worth the costs. We have taken a great deal of
heat over our present position. The reaction to an expanded position
would be far worse."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lew Malt by's department would be out of business if not for
tobacco cartel funds. As Maltby, himself, writes in a thank you
letter to Philip Morris, "As you know, this is not the type of
glamorous issue that attracts major donors... "</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If the ACLU wants to continue fighting for the tobacco cartel, it
should immediately cease the acceptance of tobacco money.</P>

<center><p><h2>PRESS STATEMENT BY RUBEN BOTELLO</h2>

<p><h3>FOUNDER, AMERICAN HOMELESS SOCIETY</h3></center>


<p>The American Homeless Society is in a running battle with <a href="http://www.sen.ca.gov/htbin/senator_profile/2">Senator Mike Thompson</a> and the State of California, due to their efforts to run hundreds of homeless out of Humboldt County, so they can proceed with their multimillion-dollar Humboldt Harbor development (see <a href="http://www.northcoast.com/~sananda/spit1.htm">http://www.northcoast.com/~sananda/spit1.htm).</a>

 <p>Hundreds of homeless are living on what is called the South Spit peninsula, at the mouth of Humboldt Harbor, and this homeless community of men, women and children is now seen as an "eyesore" by those who forced them out there in the first place, but who now want to attract tourists and sailors into a newly-developed port 'o call.  Congressman Frank Riggs is working on getting the county over $10 million for the development, while Thompson deals with rousting the homeless under state authority.

 <p>Governor Wilson would not give Senator Thompson the money to fund the roust (Senate Bill 39), so Thompson went to the State Appropriations Committee, to get $100,000 from the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund, to purchase the property and run out the homeless ASAP.

 <p><font size=+1><b>The Tobacco Lobby must be thrilled that the funds collected by the State to combat smoking and chewing tobacco, and the deadly diseases that cost California taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually, are being used for other than their intended purpose. </font size=+1>  Senator Thompson is not only acting in complete disregard for the health, safety and welfare of the South Spit homeless, he is acting in complete disregard for all Californians faced with the death, illnesses and costs related to the high use of tobacco products across the State.</b>

<h2><a name=aa1><p>FDA EDITORIAL WATCH
</a></h2>
<HR>

<ul>
<li><p>On July 13, 1995, the press reported the Food and Drug Administration had determined that nicotine was a drug, and that tobacco products should be regulated as nictoine delivery devices. Though the FDA could act on its own, it sent to President Clinton a set of initial suggestions for curbing the use of tobacco products by minors.</li> 

<li><p>On August 10, 1995, President Clinton announced his intention to allow the FDA to assume regulation of tobacco, and presented a detailed set of proposals aimed at preventing the use of tobacco products by minors. The proposals would create strict limits on the advertising, sale and distribution of cigarettes.</li> 

<li><p>On Sept. 6, 1995, Rep. David Funderburk (R-NC) introduced the "Motor Sports Protection Act," which would specifically prevent federal enforcement of advertising or promotion restrictions in the case of tobacco companies which sponsor auto racing events.</li> 

<li><p>On Sept. 21, 1995, Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford (D-KY) introduced youth access legislation which would specificaly disallow FDA regulation of tobacco. </li>

<p>Nearly every adult, adolescent or child for that matter can look at a tobacco image ad, such as Joe Camel, compare it with a tobacco company's full page print ad that claims they don't want kids to smoke, such as those currently running in major national newspapers, and tell you which one packs more punch for young people. </p>

<p>When it comes to marketing tobacco products to children, the tobacco industry's actions speak louder than its words. . . .</p>

<p>Tobacco company documents, reported in the national media, show that the tobacco industry has been tailoring its products and its marketing campaigns to young people for years. . . .</p>

<p>President Clinton and the Federal Drug Administration have a proposal to reduce the access and appeal of tobacco to children. Millions of Americans from more than 100 national medical, religious, children's, teachers' and health organizations support this proposal as part of a Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids. . . .</p>

<p>"The campaign is also supported by a coalition of Republican and Democratic members of Congress who have signed a 'Commitment to Reduce the Access and Appeal of Tobacco to Children.'  We believe our entire congressional delegation has a responsibility to support the FDA proposal and join this bipartisan coalition and the millions of Americans who want to stop the tobacco industry from selling and marketing tobacco products to children."</p>

<p>Conservative defenders of the tobacco industry are put in the untenable position of arguing that when a school gives a condom to a teen, it sends a pro-promiscuity message; when Hollywood makes a slasher movie, it glorifies violence; but when cigarette companies promote their products as hip, cool, macho etc. . . . and give away gear with obvious adolescent appeal -- it has zero impact. </p>

<p>In light of these new revelations [recently exposed industry documents from the 70s], for the tobacco industry to act as though it treats nicotine as just another flavor element is like a teen-ager saying he reads PLAYBOY for the articles. The tobacco industry, which has killed more people with its product than were killed in the Holocaust, will eventually be called to account, and all of its pieties about 'choosing' to smoke, and lies about keeping cigarettes out of the hands of minors, will pale in comparison to the price the industry will pay in the end. </p>

[The FDA's proposed tobacco regulations] could help to counteract the notion among kids that smoking is fun, harmless, and socially acceptable. For years, the tobacco industry has promoted this point of view. The FDA should be supported in its efforts to refute it.

<a name="aadn10.19"><h3>(New York) DAILY NEWS, October 19, 1995</h3> </a>
<p>New evidence has emerged that tobacco companies lace cigarets with chemicals to boost nicotine delivery. The revelations -- which fly in the face of the companies' denials -- should be the final, damning proof that Big Tobacco can't be trusted. . .

<p>Ironically, the evidence comes to light at the same time the Food and Drug Administration has extended for two months public comment on tough rules aimed at stopping cigaret companies from pitching their products at kids. Before the two months are up, 180,000 kids will have started smoking. A third will eventually die of tobacco-related illness. . .

<p>Americans already know the truth about tobacco and smoking. That any comment period should exist is ridiculous. To extend it only plays into the hands of death merchants.

<h3><a name=aaadmn>*DALLAS MORNING NEWS, September 28, 1995</a></h3>

<p>The tobacco industry says it is concerned about solving the problem of underage smoking in America. </p>

<p>But recently submitted legislation, which has the industry's support, does little to address the real issue of marketing tobacco products to young people. </p>

<p>The bill introduced by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky, pales in comparison to the strong regulations proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Here are a few examples of the glaring differences:</p>

<p>Mr. Ford's bill prohibits billboard advertising for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco within 500 feet of schools. But highway billboards facing away from schools are exempted. The FDA wants a total ban on outdoor advertising of tobacco products within 1,000 feet of schools. </p>

<p>Mr. Ford's bill requires tobacco vending machines to be in plain view and supervision of store operators. The FDA wants tobacco sales to be made face-to-face, thus eliminating vending machine sales.</p>

<p>The senator's bill limits free samples or coupons for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products. But coupons still could be placed in magazines if 85 percent of the subscribers were over the age of 18. And it places no limits in areas where underage people are not permitted. The FDA's plan would prohibit the distribution of free samples of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. Period. </p>

<p>The senator's bill would require states to make it unlawful to sell tobacco products to anyone under age 18 in order to receive drug abuse block grants. The FDA places the onus on the sellers, requiring them to verify the purchasers' age through photo ID cards.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford's measure bans tobacco brand names on video games and at family amusement centers. The FDA would ban the use of cigarette and smokeless tobacco brand names on any nontobacco item.</p>

<p>The senator's bill would deny the FDA the right to regulate tobacco products. The FDA would treat nicotine in tobacco as an addictive drug that would require regulation. And the federal agency would seek $150 million annually from the tobacco industry for education programs aimed at youthful customers.</p>

<p>The crisis of underage smoking in this nation won't be solved with half-measures such as Mr. Ford's bill. . .</p>

<p>Congress should weigh in on the side of the Food and Drug Administration. Americans must have something better than legislation that still leaves gaping loopholes for the tobacco industry to market its products to the young.</p>

<h3><a name=aaano>THE (Raleigh, NC) NEWS AND OBSERVER, September 14, 1995.</a></h3>

<p>Rep. David Funderburk would do his constituents and accuracy a favor if he would call his 'Motor Sports Protection Act' what it really is: the 'R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Protection Act.' . . </p>

<p>Clinton's wise and well-meaning efforts to curtail teenage smoking would not force Reynolds to stop sponsoring races. All that would be required is a simple name change from Winston Cup to Reynolds Cup. But tobacco executives don't want to do that because they know that kids watch racing and they know that brand name advertising works on kids. . . .</p>

<p>The fight is not about saving racing and it never has been. For Funderburk and Richard Petty, a former champion who knows better but who's been blinded by Republican campaign ambitions, to scare race fans into thinking that mean Bill Clinton wants to put the brakes on their excitement is just plain old political expediency.</p>

<h3><a name=aaacr>CONSUMER REPORTS, October 1995</h3></a>

We support the President's proposal. It could make a serious dent in the tobacco industry's ability to recruit young new smokers.

We especially support its requirement that retailers demand photo identification before selling cigarettes to young-looking customers. Vigorous enforcement of that requirement by state and local authorities would surely help end the plague of teen smoking.


<h3><a name=aaausa>USA TODAY, September 20, 1995</h3></a>

<p>Like them or loathe them, tobacco companies should be free to peddle their wares. If they choose to make that sales pitch on the sides of race cars whizzing around a track or on the backs of pit crews, that's their business -- as long as they make no false claims. . .</p>

<p>And it's not just sports advertising that will fall under FDA's proposed rules. . . . it wants to dictate the form tobacco ads in publications with youth readerships of more than 15 percent -- black and white, words only, no illustrations. . .</p>

<p>If you really want kids not to smoke, give them the facts. Make cigarettes harder for minor to buy. But don't waste time on contrived schemes that will do no good.</p>

<h3><a name=aaajoe>JOE CHERNER, USA TODAY, September 20, 1995</h3></a>


<p>Cigarettes are not entirely a legal product. They are illegal to sell to children, illegal to use in most public places and illegal to advertise on television and radio. Call them what they are: a semilegal, cancer-causing, addictive drug. . . .</p>

<p>When cigarette advertising was banned on television, there were rumors that the tobacco cartel would circumvent the ban by sponsoring televised sporting events such as auto racing or women's tennis. The tobacco cartel swore it would never do anything so deceitful and promised to obey the letter and spirit of the law.</p>

<p>During the two-hour telecast of the Marlboro Grand Prix, the Marlboro logo appears on screen almost 6,000 times. . . .</p>

<p>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED FOR KIDS gives out Marlboro race- car trading cards. Other youth magazines, such as ROLLING STONE, feature full-page ads of popular race-car drivers dressed in Marlboro uniforms in front of Marlboro cars. . . .</p>

<p>By sponsoring auto racing, the tobacco cartel violates its own voluntary code, which says it will not use athletes to promote smoking. The cartel adopts such voluntary codes to head off legislation, knowing full well that there is no penalty for a violating voluntary code. That's why the Clinton administration is right -- we need government action. . . . </p>

<h3><a name=aaa0>CHICAGO TRIBUNE, September 14, 1995</h3></a>

<p>Not long ago, President Clinton declared war on teenage tobacco smoking, vowing to cut its use in half within seven years. The same campaign, conducted with equal zeal and power, should be waged against marijuana and other illicit drugs.</p>

<p>
<p>Today, more than 3,000 young Americans became regular smokers. They lit a slow burning fire in their lungs by taking a few puffs of a cigarette -- and that will lead to another cigarette, and another one, and another one. . . . </p>
<p>
<p>Tobacco addiction is a pediatric disease that must be stopped. . . .</p>
<p>
<p>Even though it is illegal to sell cigarettes to minors, more than 80 percent of adult smokers lit their first cigarette before their 18th birthday. And more than 50 percent became regular smokers by that time. </p>
<p>
<p>First, we propose to reduce children's easy access to tobacco products. Building on state laws proven to be only partially effective, we would shut down avenues by which cigarettes end up in children's hands. . . . </p>
<p>
<p>Second, we propose to limit the appeal of cigarettes, chewing tobacco and other tobacco products. </p>
<p>
<p>Children face a barrage of advertisements that glamorize smoking as cool, sexy and grown-up. . . .  We do not propose to ban all tobacco advertising, but would change the rules to put power back in the hands of parents.</p>
<p>
<p>Because parents have no control over the pro-smoking messages their children see outside the home, outdoor tobacco advertising such as signs and billboards would be prohibited within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds. . . .</p>
<p>
<p>As a society, we must send clear and consistent messages to young people: Tobacco is dangerous and addictive. It is not cool or OK. It is not respectful of one's body. Don't start using tobacco, and if you have, stop right away.</p>
<p>
<p>There's no question, the president's bold initiative is smart public-health policy. The health-care costs associated with tobacco use totaled a staggering $50 billion in 1993.</p>
<p>
<p>More important, it's the right thing to do. Seven in 10 young Americans who smoke say they regret having started. We have a chance to save a generation from a lifetime of addiction.</p>

<h3><a name=aaa2>RICHARD BURR (R-NC), CHARLOTTE (North Carolina) OBSERVER, September 3, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>The crux of this debate is not whether we should limit youth access to tobacco products, but rather how to accomplish this worthy goal. . .</p>
<p>
<p>I am alarmed by the devastating effects additional regulations will have on the farmers and manufacturers of tobacco products in my district. I cannot understand why the president believes a government bureaucracy is more effective than parents. . .</p>
<p>
<p>Today the villain is tobacco. Tomorrow, chocolate, caffeine and fatty foods could be the next convenient foe. . . . </p>
<p>
<p>Through the combined efforts of parents, the tobacco industry and government, proper enforcement of the laws prohibiting minors' access to tobacco would be much more effective. In addition, the tobacco industry has already instituted multimillion dollar campaigns aimed at telling kids that smoking is an adult choice.</p>
<p>
<p>I have seen firsthand the horrors of the ineptitude and mismanagement of the FDA. The FDA also lags behind most countries in approving lifesaving drugs, with a current approval process that takes an average of an amazing 14.8 years. . . . </p>
<p>
<p>The FDA's core mission is to approve pharmaceuticals and medical devices and to protect food safety. Period. As one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives eloquently pointed out, to give the FDA regulatory authority over the marketing and advertising of tobacco is 'like asking the Navy to run the Department of Agriculture'. . . . </p>
<p>
<p>Tangible efforts were made to craft a solution creating a partnership between parents, government and business rather than allowing the government to act as the nation's nanny. Parenting should be done by parents, not bureaucrats. . .</p>
<p>
<p>President Clinton's willingness to send children and smoking into an endless legal quagmire lends credibility to the armchair policy analysis of the tobacco farmers in my district -- that the president's plan is to limit or ban all smoking.</p>

<p>Since the regulatory function of the federal government is in retreat, its surviving adherents have grown passionate about smoking, an easy target.

<p>This is a matter of regret to me, as one who still misses cigarette ads on TV. . . . For out of the dozens of different types of cigarettes, drawing some distinctions required extraordinary feats of creativity in what must have been the golden age of Madison Avenue. . . . " </p>

<p>Many young people take the threat of cancer in 20 or 30 years lightly because they don't plan on being around that long. With death coming frequently and in many forms, from AIDS to violence, the long-term dangers of cigarettes are not a pressing concern for teens who simply can't imagine themselves in 20 years. </p>

<p>Smoking in this context isn't a passive act, a succumbing to constant peer pressure in order to be part of the "in crowd." It's an act of despair. . .</p>

<p>If the president is serious about freeing young people from tobacco addiction, he's got to find ways to help them imagine a future.</p>

<h3><a name=aaa3>DR. ROBERT LESSLIE, THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER, August 29, 1995</a></h3>

<p>One of the reasons teenagers give for smoking is that ''everybody's doing it.'' Their erroneous perception, based partly on effective advertising, marketing and brainwashing, is that the majority of teenagers are currently smoking. ''If everybody's doing it, it must be OK.'' The reality is that only 25-30 percent of them smoke. . .</p>

<p>With my extensive parental wisdom, I decided to test this hypothesis on my 18-year-old. Surely she knows that smokers, even teenage smokers, are in the minority. She will know that most of her peers don't smoke.</p>

<p>So I asked her. How many teenagers in this country smoke?'' Her response: ''Oh, probably 80 percent. Maybe more.'' </p>

<p>Doggone it. How do you compete with Joe Camel? . . .</p>

<p>Clinton's critics claim his intrusive proposed efforts will have little effect on teenage smoking. But if only one unnecessary death is prevented, will the effort be worth it? </p>

<p>What if that one death is that of your father, healthy three months ago, now dying painfully with lung cancer? Or your 40-year- old son, suffering the ravages of mouth and throat cancer, having endured two disfiguring surgeries of his face? Or your spouse, confined to a bed, chained to an oxygen tank, slowly suffocating with emphysema?</p>

<h3><a name=aa5>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL FRIDAY, AUGUST 25, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>President Clinton has finally found an industry he can bash without it being hazardous to his political health. . . </p>

<p>In principle Mr. Clinton has a point: Surely cigarette smoking is bad for you and for society, and public policy should seek to minimize it. Yet his specific proposals would be further government-imposed nuisances . . .</p>

<p>The big problem with Mr. Clinton's plan is that it's going to be run by a federal government that doesn't currently have much moral capital. . . It has abandoned Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign of the '80s in favor of concentrating on hard-core drug users. The use of hard drugs among teens dropped under the earlier approach, and is now increasing. Indeed, we suspect the increase in both tobacco and drugs reflect a moral aura to which the White House has contributed no little.</p>

<p>The way to keep kids off cigarettes is the same way to keep them off marijuana or cocaine: Persuade them that it's a bad idea--that in the long run cigarettes kill and in the short run are a disgusting habit. While there certainly is a role for government-particularly in setting the moral tone, such a campaign is probably better left to civic culture. If President Clinton really wants to curb smoking instead of merely making political points, he might call tobacco to the attention of the private groups dealing rather well, thank you, with drunken driving, TV violence and gangsta rap.</p>

<h3><a name=aa6>INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY, August 23, 1995

<p>Smoking takes years off your life, and if tobacco didn't contain nicotine, almost no one would smoke. The tobacco companies know this, but weasel out of saying so outright. . . .</p>

<p>The [FDA] isn't doing a great job at its real job. . . Why add a job it has no hope of doing well? . . . .</p>

<p>. . . These attempts to make regulators or the courts 'solve' the problem let us dodge a hard truth: Smoking won't stop unless smokers, and their loved ones and communities, take responsibility. . . .</p>

<p>Smart, or just plain honest, Republicans should start inoculating themselves against the charge of being soft on tobacco by backing tactics more effective than those proposed by Clinton -- by backing national education efforts, by making it easier for communities to fight smoking and by joining the fight in their own homes." </p>

<h3><a name=aa7>DR. ELIZABETH M. WHELAN, GREENWICH TIME, August 23, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>. . . the Clinton plan is more symbolism than substance. . .</p>
 
<p>Instead of blowing smoke (as President Clinton is doing), and instead of defending the tobacco industry (as the Republicans seem to be doing), we should mount a bipartisan effort to get to the heart of the problem: the exemption from the burden of corporate responsibility that the U.S. Congress gave to the tobacco industry in 1965.</p>

<p>When Congress voted to place the mandated government warning label on cigarettes (a move that was largely orchestrated by the tobacco industry), the industry received a priceless gift: freedom from the responsibility to be accountable for the health effects of their product.</p>

<p>Since then the industry has argued (and its position has been largely supported in the courts) that when Congress mandated the "health" warning that preempted the industry's responsibility to warn about the dangers of cigarettes as the manufacturers of any other product would be legally required to do.</p>

<p>Thus, lawsuits brought against the industry have unanimously failed because the tobacco companies enjoy a Teflon-like protection from lawsuits.                          </p>
<p>The threat of litigation is a powerful incentive for keeping an industry honest -- and for keeping that industry aware of its obligation to be totally up front with consumers about the dangers of its product. But cigarette manufacturers, legally unaccountable, to date have had no incentive whatsoever to be honest. Our society has been waging a phantom war on cigarette smoking for more than 30 years. The Clinton announcement is an extension of that illusory battle. . .</p>

<p>Instead of tilting at regulatory windmills, the president and Congress should remove the government label on cigarettes, allow litigation to level the playing field, and treat tobacco companies as they treat all other corporations. </p>

<p>When tobacco companies are held responsible for the consequences of their actions they will be forced, in their own interest, to take effective measures to ensure: a) that underage teens do not buy their product (if they do, the tobacco company, not the teens or the vendors, should be held legally responsible); b) that advertising, if it continues at all, is free of images that conflict with the reality of disease and death; and c) that all smokers or prospective smokers are given the nitty-gritty facts about smoking, addiction, disease and death.</p>

Misleading ads, the health and welfare of teen-agers and indeed the health and welfare of grown-ups have nothing to do with it. It has to do with power. </p>

<p>The tobacco companies boast of how much they're already doing to prevent teens from smoking . . . They readily grant the premises of the superstitions Mr. Clinton then wields against them, and when he or his successors do use federal power to outlaw tobacco completely, they and their few furtive customers will wonder what happened.</p>

<p>There is now little doubt that we are witnessing a tidal tug toward a new prohibition, in which tobacco and alcohol are the targets. . . Any war on tobacco is doomed to fail.

<p>It's true that I may have stopped earlier or never begun if we had been told then what is gospel now: cigarettes are deadly.</p>

<p>The industry argues that tobacco advertising is protected First Amendment speech. But once the FDA has classified nicotine as a drug, it has every right to restrict advertising of products containing the drug. . . . </p>

<p>Indeed, courts have held that if the state has the power to ban a harmful activity or dangerous product, it can certainly take the less onerous action of restricting its advertising. 'Commercial speech' has never enjoyed the same constitutional protection as 'political speech' -- hence all the laws against false and deceptive advertising. Commercial speech can be restricted to advance a compelling state interest if the ban is narrowly tailored. . .</p>

<p>Tobacco isn't coffee, but a proven killer. Smoking isn't a choice but an addiction. And the administration's policy aims at children who cannot appreciate the long-term health dangers. . . .</p>

<p>If they win, they will reap the harvest of a million or so teenagers who might otherwise have refused themselves the use of cigarettes. But the tobacco industry might then face a population enraged that existing law prohibits earnest efforts to protect teen-agers from developing habits that can be mortal.</p>

<p>If that stage is reached, the tobacco companies will be in real trouble.</p>

<p>Steve Parrish, senior vice president of corporate affairs for Philip Morris, contended that the "hidden agenda" of the FDA was to prohibit cigarette smoking by adults. That line of argument is what lawyers call the "slippery slope," as in: if you outlaw pornography, the next thing you know you will he outlawing James Joyce.</p>

<p>. . .  Here and there one hears of proposals to tax a pack of cigarettes by $1, $2, $5.  . . . A comprehensive campaign against cigarettes could go in that direction, without any obstacle in the First Amendment.</p>

<p>. . .     It is in the interests of the tobacco companies to permit Clinton his intervention. The part of his program that calls for banning advertising especially designed to attract teen lust might be challenged on constitutional grounds, but again, this is not a judicial contest the tobacco industry should want to be seen as winning.

<p>. . . One young man expressed the views of many teenage smokers when he said, 'If cigarets were really that dangerous, they wouldn't be selling them in stores.'</p>

<p>On the face of it his skepticism seems logical. After all, kids have a right to feel that their elders wouldn't behave so cavalierly with a deadly substance. But the kids are wrong.</p>

<p>Although evidence is mounting that executives of the major tobacco companies have lied to Congress and the public about what they know about the harmful effects of tobacco, many members of Congress have rushed to the companies' defense at the behest of lobbyists who are generous with their nicotine-stained dollars.</p>

<p>This assault reveals two things about the Clinton White House. First, the president and FDA Commissioner David Kessler don't want to admit they plan to ban cigarettes. . . .</p>

<p>This leads to the second and more profound revelation: The White House itself is addicted to a failed view of human nature. </p>

<p>The anti-smoking campaign will fail, like other forays into federal nannyism. It demands nothing of the people and seems utterly oblivious to the power of incentives. Nancy Reagan's oft-maligned 'Just Say No' campaign worked because it encouraged youngsters to behave responsibly. Bill Clinton could adopt a similar approach: 1) Help young smokers appreciate how stupid they look and 2) Throw a few young scofflaws in jail. That may not be as much fun as beating up on Joe Camel -- but at least it would stand some chance of success.</p>

<p>Clinton's determination to crack down on teen-age smoking by targeting tobacco sales and advertising to minors should help cast him as a president willing to act out of conviction rather than politics.

<p>[I]t's right to put together a special effort aimed at heading off the addiction among new generations of smokers. Some of it may prove impractical.

<p>BIG TOBACCO HAS mostly itself to blame for President Clinton's decision to abandon voluntary measures aimed at curbing smoking pitches to America's youth. . . That Clinton pulled no punches stems at least in part from the companies' behavior.</p>

<p>For decades, the tobacco cartel has peddled a highly dangerous and addictive product -- and denied the obvious consequences . . That denial reached its nadir in April '94, when executives of the top seven American tobacco makers took turns swearing under oath to Congress that cigarets are neither dangerous nor addictive.</p>

<p>It's not incidental that much of what Clinton based his decision on came from secret documents written by tobacco company scientists and executives. </p>

<p>. . . This duplicity stands in sharp contrast to the actions of brewers and distillers</p>

<p>. . . Tobacco companies, of course, insist they don't want kids to smoke and don't target them in their $6 billion marketing and advertising budgets.</p>

<p>Yet 86% of kid smokers choose one of the three most advertised brands -- Marlboro, Newport or Camel -- while only 35% of adults choose those brands. Here's another sickening statistic: 30% of 3-year-olds and 91% of 6-year-olds recognize the Joe Camel cartoon character. For comparison, 62% of 6-year-olds recognize Ronald McDonald.</p>

<p>Keep those numbers in mind as the battle rages over Clinton's plan. And watch how the tobacco companies try to wriggle away from the fatal facts. Then it will be crystal clear why Clinton had to act.</p>

<p>This is obviously not a politically opportune time to extend the arm of federal government, but FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler has built a solid case for the move against smoking. . . .</p>

<p>The states have mostly done a poor job in enforcing existing laws, and the voluntary efforts by the mendacious tobacco industry are laughable. A recent packet on anti- youth smoking programs by RJ Reynolds' Tobacco Co. makes no mention of cancer, heart disease or emphysema. </p>

<p>Clinton's perspective isn't traditional.

<p>To see President Clinton's attempts to limit teenage smoking as an inevitable step toward prohibition is unreasonable, and hinders the discussion of good, sane regulations. . .

That might get them a place at the table as the discussion of regulation continues among Clinton administration officials and in Congress. The best approach now is to try to hold down the economic casualties -- because the war is plainly lost.</p>

<h3><a name=aa32>NEW YORK TIMES, August 11, 1995

But it is probably stretching too far to insist that all other outdoor advertising contain only black-and-white text, with no pictures or color allowed, for those ads are aimed at adults as well. . . . </p>

<p>But whatever the legal merits may be, there is no question that President Clinton is on the right track in calling for the strongest Federal effort yet to curb teen- age smoking.

<p>ANOTHER WORTHY cause - keeping cigarettes away from children - threatens to add another flash flood to the waterworld of regulation and litigation.</p>

<p>If (the FDA's proposed) measures will work, fine. But let local and state governments set them up, not a ponderous Washington bureaucracy. </p>

<p>The question is not whether to discourage smoking. We already do that with warnings on cigarette packs and public-service campaigns against smoking. The question is whether to attack the problem with federal regulation, a tactic that already is being challenged in court, or to encourage local remedies and induce the tobacco companies to make changes voluntarily. </p>

<p>Philip Morris proposed to discontinue free samples and cut off retailers who sell to youths under 18. That's too tame. The industry should get serious in the next 90 days, before Clinton's FDA action goes into effect.</p>

<p>We must not be tricked again. If history has taught us anything, it is that this industry must be judged by its 40-year record, not by its promises to protect the health of our children.</p>

<p>It is time we recognized the need for a comprehensive approach that includes eliminating advertising and marketing that appeal to children, reducing the ease with which children obtain tobacco, funding public education campaigns designed by health experts and not the tobacco industry, and overseeing tobacco manufacturing to ensure that nicotine and other ingredients are not manipulated to enhance addiction and that hundreds of additives in cigarettes do not contribute to the risks of smoking. Only a strong agency such as the FDA is capable of implementing such a program. . . .</p>

<p>Given all that we know, the scientific case for protecting children from tobacco is indisputable. The moral imperative to act is overwhelming. . . This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue.

<p>The issue these days isn't whether smoking is harmful. It's the narrower question of whether the cigarette companies knew they were working with a body-altering chemical substance, nicotine, and whether they designed their cigarettes purposely in such a way that the one-time casual user would get hooked. The answer is looking more and more like yes. This is an important advance, because if tobacco can be correctly described as a drug, the FDA has the legal right to regulate it."></p>

<h3><a name=aa53>WISCONSIN STATE JOURNAL, July 23, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>The battle the FDA has picked to fight is a battle in which the individual's freedom to choose is on one side and government's authority to compel behavior is on the other side. "></p>

<h3><a name=aa54>DETROIT FREE PRESS, July 22, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>Stating the plain truth that tobacco is an addictive drug is another logical step in the effort to make sure people understand what they're getting into when they start using it."></p>

<h3><a name=aa55>PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, July 20, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>Bold National Strides Should Be Taken To Treat Tobacco As The Addictive Scourge It Is."></p>

<h3><a name=aa56>CAPE COD TIMES, July 16, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>The FDA has every right to act in the interests of the kids. And Mr. Clinton could do battle with the pro-tobacco, get-government-off-our-back types in Congress with a joyous heart -- the majority of the voters do not smoke, and he'd be championing children.</p>

<h3><a name=aa57>CHICAGO TRIBUNE, July 15, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>If nicotine were a newly discovered drug and tobacco a previously unheard-of product, there is no question that the American people would want both strictly regulated." [I]t would be foolish to the point of madness for . . . the Food and Drug Administration to arrogate to itself the right to regulate tobacco. It would be no less foolish for the White House to do so. On an issue that touches so many popular concerns and habits, it is the people's branch, the Congress, that ought to take the initiative."></p>

<h3><a name=aa58>WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE, March 16, 1995
</a></h3>

<p>Three cheers for Dr. David Kessler...</p>

<p>. . . We walk now into the shadowy world of influence. Many photographs and cartoons are designed to attract young people to smoke cigarettes. These would be forbidden under federal law. Now this is tough legislation, inviting a government official or two government officials to decide that that particular advertisement is aimed at young people. Okay, it is a difficult assignment, and a lot of quarrels would result. (Is that cowboy ad designed for kids?) But the philosophical position is surely sound: i.e., there are professionals who sit down at work and ask themselves: How can I design an ad that entices 15-year-olds to begin smoking?</p>

<p>It is a legitimate enterprise of an agency charged by the law to oversee the consumption of drugs to inquire into the merchandising of them. </p>

<p>..."The figures tell us that 75 percent of the young people who take up the habit will very soon regret having done so. So why not give them a helping hand -- while simultaneously giving dignified berth to those of adult age who are addicted? </p>

<p>...The concept -- pediatric disease -- qualifies as an epiphany, given the acknowledged authority of society over a minor. . . It yields no substantial libertarian ground to add to the list enforcement mechanisms designed to dissuade the 15-year-old from taking up a habit that brings on aching experiences (those who give up smoking), and at the other end premature and painful death."</p>

May 15, 1996. Attempting to preempt FDA regulation Philip Morris and US Tobacco sent a series of proposals to control youth access to tobacco. Tobacco control advocates were unimpressed, saying the provisions in practise amounted to a "stunt.". The White House said it was "somewhat encouraged and slightly disappointed." Notably absent from participation were R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co.

<li>Tallahassee, FL. 5/10/96. Tobacco defendants' motions for rehearing were denied by the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Florida in two class action lawsuits. The defendants were seeking decertification of both classes:

<ul><li>Broin v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., involves non-smoking flight attendants who work or have worked for U.S. airlines and allege injuries from exposure to ETS.

<li>Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company involves plaintiffs who are Florida citizens and residents who claim they have become addicted to cigarette smoke and have suffered injuries as a result. </ul>

<p>Defendants intend to appeal both decisions to the Florida Supreme Court.

<b>Attention All Tobacco Control Activists: At your earliest convenience before Christmas, please telephone Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (617-635-4000), City Councilor James Kelly (617-3203), or City Councilor Maureen Feeney (617-635-3455) to let them know why the tobacco control program should not be eliminated from the Boston Health Department. </b>

<h2>Tobacco Control: Up in Smoke?
Boston Public Health Commission Demonstrates Indecisiveness </h2>

<br>For Immediate Release
<br>Tuesday, December 17, 1996
<br>Contact:	Celia Wcislo, President
<br>SEIU, Local 285
<br>tel. (617) 426-0410 fax (617) 426-7116

<p>[Boston] Recent actions and statements by Boston's Public Health Commission have indicated both a lack of direction and a retreat from the vital public function of tobacco control.

<p>At a Nov. 22 Town Meeting for Commission staff, Acting Public Health Director Lillian Shirley announced that layoffs "were not anticipated soon." Less than a week later, Local 285 was notified by the Commissionís labor relations office that "all employees/titles" in the Tobacco Control Program were being "eliminated."

<p>One reason given was "decreased funding." But this contradicts Massachusetts Department of Public Health records indicating 60% funding available until July 1997. The Commission did not respond to Local 285's queries into whether existing funding would be returned to the State re-allocated to select administrative staff who will attempt to carry out program functions. 

<p>A second reason was "regulatory compliance." City Councilor Daniel F. Conley has sponsored the "Boston Ordinance Limiting Tobacco Access by Youth." 

<p>Although this ordinance has yet to be enacted, Commission Counsel claimed the new ordinance would shift focus to enforcement alone. This action ignores recent Massachusetts based data suggesting that enforcement alone may not be the answer to tobacco control. On Sunday, November 29, 1996, the New York Times, the Charleston Gazette, and the Dallas Morning News reported on data presented by Nancy A. Rigotti and colleagues at the 124th Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association. In a two-year study of 3 pairs of demographically-matched Massachusetts cities, investigators found that while such ordinances did in fact reduce the sales of tobacco to minors, there was no difference in prevalence of smoking among teens in towns with and without ordinances.

<p>Anti-tobacco health activists decry enforcement alone which merely involves collecting a permit fee from retailers and period compliance checks. Here, the focus is completely on the retailer. The elimination of the Tobacco Control Program by a major cityís Health Department is tantamount to saying that as long as Boston retailers do not sell to youth, we will forget about adult smokers.

<p>When union representatives asked the Boston Public Health Commission Counsel who would handling the new enforcement activity, they responded that the Law Department would. (Usually Law Dept. personnel serve only in an advisory capacity to public health programs). Seven days later, the Counsel again reversed course and said the Commission would delegate this activity to the Inspectional Services Dept. Such hasty and unquestioned delegations of authority usually occur in small towns, not in large cities that have a well-established Public Health Dept. with specific expertise on tobacco hazards.

<p>Even the best and most qualified city building or restaurant inspectors do not currently have the public health expertise of the Boston Tobacco Control staff. For example, this expertise includes developing smoking cessation programs, public protection of nonsmokers with respiratory sensitivity, public warnings, and monitoring of indoor air contamination by second hand smoke. Tobacco control efforts in the community usually consist of someone in a health department who, in addition to performing retailer compliance check, develops educational materials for area health centers, schools, hospitals, businesses, and residences. The eliminated Boston Tobacco Control Program monitored compliance to the law against selling tobacco to minors and they generated citywide educational materials and billboards. It provided many services that clinic programs could not readily perform. 

<p>When the new ordinance is enacted, the incoming permit fee revenues will simply be an instance of the city choosing to profit from a childhood disease: addiction to nicotine. The elimination of this program, in light of the existing grant money and the projected revenues from permit fees which can fund it, set a bad precedent for the Boston Public Health Commissionís commitment to a major public health danger.

<h3><center>Historic Tobacco Settlement Close To Completion
</center></h3>

JACKSON, Miss. " The historic first settlement of a tobacco lawsuit could be wrapped up in a few days or a few weeks with Liggett Group Inc., sources familiar with the negotiations speculate.

<p>A source, who did not want to be identified, told Mealey Publications that negotiations on the proposed settlement are continuing and that the bulk of the deal has been finalized. However, the source could not comment on what issues are still in dispute.</p>

<p>If successful, the proposed agreement " which Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore's office says could reach $2 billion " would be the first settlement of a cigarette lawsuit. Negotiations have been going on for a month between Liggett, Brooke Group Ltd., attorneys and several attorneys general, including Moore.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Liggett would, among other things, withdraw its objection to the Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction over tobacco and agree to implement some of the agency's regulations. The tobacco company would also agree to compensate Mississippi, Florida, Massachusetts and West Virginia for past and current expenses incurred in providing medical care to residents allegedly suffering from smoking-related illnesses.</p>

<p>Minnesota, which also has a Medicaid reimbursement suit against the tobacco industry, is still considering participation in the deal.</p>

<p>The proposed deal could include RJR Nabisco if its shareholders elect a Brooke Group representative to the company's board of directors. The new board would spin off the company's food business and submit to shareholders a proposal to merge with Liggett. If the shareholders approve the merger, RJR would be bound by the agreement.</p>

<p>To cover future tobacco-related state health care costs, Liggett (and possibly RJR) would additionally pay the four settling states 2.5 percent of their pre-tax profits or $25 million annually, whichever is greater, over the 25-year life of the proposed settlement.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the settling defendants would agree to establish a fund for other states that have not filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry but may choose to do so in the future. Depending on the number of states that would join the proposed settlement, Liggett (and perhaps RJR) would pay $50 million annually or 5 percent of their pre-tax profits into this fund.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the deal would also dismiss Liggett from the massive Castano class action in New Orleans. The Journal added that the agreement would bar class members, which is essentially all current smokers in the United States, from suing the company for their alleged nicotine addiction.</p>

<p>A source told Mealey Publications that court approval would be necessary in the Castano class action but would most likely not be necessary in the four state Medicaid cases. Appeals of the Castano certification order are pending before the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>However, the Wall Street Journal reported that there is an "escape clause" that allows Liggett to get out of the deal " if other tobacco companies win in the same suits Liggett proposes to settle; if not enough Castano class members decide to participate in the deal; and if additional states file Medicaid reimbursement suits and refuse to participate in the settlement.</p>

<p>Further details will be covered in subsequent issues of The Report.</p>

<h2>Department of Defense Among Top Ten Tobacco Retailers</h2>


<p>October 22, 1996. The Department of Defense is one of the largest tobacco retailers in the nation, at the same time DOD is trying to increase preparedness among members of the Armed Services.</p>

<p>Six DOD services sell tobacco at a subsidized rate to servicemen and women and reservists and veterans.  These are:  AAFES [Army and Air Force Exchange Service], NESC [Navy Exchange Service Command], DCA [Defense Commissary Agency], MCES [Marine Corps Exchange Service], CGES [Coast Guard Exchange Service], and VCS [Veterans Commissary Service].  Among them, they sell hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidized smokes, CONUS [continental US] and overseas.</p>

<p>AAFES alone is one of the largest tobacco retailers in the nation.  I received their sales figures recently.  There is a direct correlation between their sales in a state and the cigarette tax in that state.   The subsidy is real effective at getting them into the exchange stores.</p>

<p>Therefore, the military exchanges have set up a pricing/profit structure [assisted by lucrative contracts from the tobacco companies] that encourages strong marketing of cigarettes to servicemembers.</p>

<p>There are huge quantities of tobacco flowing through military hands, and the profits for those exchange services are astonishing.  Not only is there an outright profit in the 30-40% range, but they get very lucrative product placement fees based on how they display the product.  Each tobacco company contracts with the government through a *Director of Military Sales*.</p>

<br>Army & Air Force Exchange Service
<br>Attn:  Cindy Reiber
<br>FOIA Administrator
<br>Corporate Communications
<br>P.O. Box 660202
<br>Dallas, TX  75266-0202
<br>214-312-2011

<p>Here's an example of what I recently received from AAFES recently:

<ul>
<li>Statistics on cigarette/tobacco sales by base location.</li> 
<li>Total tobacco sales worldwide and nationwide.</li> 
<li>Copies of contracts with the major tobacco companies.</li> 
<li>AAFES Annual Reports</li> 
<li>Guidelines & procedures for tobacco sales and marketing for military</li> 
<li>All memos from AAFES's electronic bulletin board for tobacco</li> 
<li>AAFES Board Meeting Minutes</li> 
<li>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the new Tobacco Pricing Policy</li> 
<li>AAFES Strategic Plans and five year plans</li> 
<li>AAFES Sourcing List for tobacco products</li> 
</ul>

<p>I also have received comparable materials from each of the other agencies.  I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader if you want to contact the other exchange services.</p>

<p>One last question:  why such duplication?  Why are there six exchange services doing essentially the same job?  And why is the DOD doing such a good job marketing cigarettes at the same time it is trying to reduce tobacco use among soldiers, and while the VA incurs such huge medical expenses treating veterans with smoking-related diseases?</p>

<hr>Further Information on Tobacco Sales in the Military from the New York Times Editorial, <i>The Pentagon Tries to Kick the Habit</i> (October 25, 1996)
<p>
<i>At military commissaries around the world, cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold at prices 30 to 60 percent lower than those charged by commercial grocery stores. That is because commissaries receive about $900 million in government subsidies each year to help cover overhead costs. That allows them to sell goods for only 5 percent above cost. Low prices, in turn, help commissaries move 58 million cartons of cigarettes a year, for a total of $458 million in sales of cigarettes and chewing tobacco. 
<p>
Those high sales reflect a 32 percent smoking rate among the 1.4 million active-duty military personnel, higher than the 25 percent among the general population. The Defense Department estimates that its many smokers incur about $530 million a year in health-care costs and $345 million in lost productivity.
<p>
. . . Although commissaries will continue to sell them, the Pentagon will transfer the responsibility for pricing from the commissaries to post exchanges, the military equivalent of department stores. Since the exchanges are not subsidized, they are able to charge prices that are still below the private market but higher than the commissary rate.</i>

<center><h2>The Richard Kluger 5-Point Peace Plan</h2>
Excerpts from the April 7, 1996 New York Times Magazine article <i>Dance with the Devil</i></center>
<hr>
<br>...feel-good moralizing and name-calling fail to advance the true social imperative the issue demands: saving as many as possible of the more than 400,000 lives smoking takes annually in this country. . .  it is time . . . to make a deal--to dance with the devil. . .

<p>All sides, accordingly, may find this  to be an auspicious time to consider a sweeping legislative compromise, embracing the following features:

<ol>
<li>CONGRESS WOULD ISSUE A BLANKET GRANT OF IMMUNITY TO THE TOBACCO COMPANIES AGAINST ALL PENDING AND FUTURE PRODUCT-LIABILITY CLAIMS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE HIGHLY HAZARDOUS NATURE OF SMOKING HAS BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE AND ADEQUATELY WARNED AGAINST.</li> 
<p>
<li>THE FDA WOULD BE GIVEN REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF MANUFACTURE AND PACKAGING OF CIGARETTES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO SET MAXIMUM LEVELS FOR THEIR HAZARDOUS INCREDIENTS.</li> 
<p>
<li>HEALTH WARNING LABELS WOULD BE ENLARGED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE BACK OF ALL CIGARETTE PACKS AND WOULD CARRY FAR MORE INFORMATIVE LANGUAGE.</li> 
<p>
<li>PROMPT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED OSHA REGULATION RESTRICTING SMOKING AT MOST WORK PLACES TO WELL-VENTILATED ANNEXES AND OF THE FDA PROGRAM TO MAKE CIGARETTE MARKETING FAR LESS ALLURING TO YOUNG PEOPLE.</li> 
<p>
<li>THE FEDERAL CIGARETTE TAX WOULD BE DOUBLED TO 48 CENTS TO PAY FOR ENFORCING THESE NEW REGULATIONS. AN ADDITIONAL 2-CENTS-A-PACK LEVY WOULD PAY FOR AN ANTISMOKING ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN AND OTHER PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS LIKE FREE QUIT CLINICS, TO BE RUN BY THE OFFICE ON SMOKING AND HEALTH.</li> 
</ol>
<br>
Such a five-point settlement . . . could save thousands of lives and go far toward reducing the severest effects of an infernal product that as a practical matter can never be outlawed or ever made truly safe.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>HBO and Consumer Reports Television Look at The
Hazards of Smoking and Show How Kids are Targeted by The Tobacco
Industry</H2>

<P>Anyone who has not tried smoking by age 19 most likely will not
start. As a result, tobacco companies must do everything in their
power to attract young people if they are to replace the 5,000
smokers who either die or quit every day in America. </P>

<P>This November, HBO and Consumer Reports Television, the team
responsible for the acclaimed ``Buy Me That!'' shows, join forces
once again for the timely family special SMOKE ALARM: THE UNFILTERED
TRUTH ABOUT CIGARETTES. A revealing look at the tobacco industry's
marketing efforts to children, the teenage smoking epidemic, and the
hazards of tobacco, this exclusive presentation debuts THURSDAY, NOV.
21 (7:00-7:30 p.m. ET), the day of ``The Great American Smokeout.''
</P>

<P>Other playdates: Nov. 24 and 26, and Dec. 2 and 6.) </P>

<P>Using a variety of entertaining approaches, this fast-paced
special combines live-action segments, animated shorts and comments
from actual kids to underscore the dangers of tobacco smoking and
chewing. The show emphasizes the harsh realities of tobacco's health
hazards, including facts about cancer and premature death. For
example, the risk of lung cancer at age 50 is 350% higher for a
person who started smoking at age 13, compared to a person who
started at age 23. </P>

<P>``Kids do not like to be made fools of,'' said Sheila Nevins,
senior vice president of documentary and family programinng at HBO,
and an executive producer of the program. ``Our aim is to show them
how they're being misled and negatively influenced by cigarette
advertising and promotions.''</P>

<P>Segments of SMOKE ALARM: THE UNFILTERED TRUTH ABOUT CIGARETTES
include:</P>

<P>``The Lounge Lungs,'' a couple of lung-puppets who provide segues
between sections of the show with bad puns about smoking. Featuring
the voices of Joseph Bologna and Renee Taylor, the red-and-brown
Lounge Lungs, afflicted with emphysema, are a striking illustration
of tobacco's health consequences. The two were created specially for
the show by veteran puppeteer Marty Robinson (''The Little Shop of
Horrors,'' ``Sesame Street''), and operated by Robinson and Pam
Arciero (''Sesame Street''). </P>

<P>``Butts,'' a high-energy mock game show that serves up the facts
about smoking to its contestants (actors Jeffrey Landman and Diane
Lozada). The smarmy host (played by Peter Jacobson) dumps contestants
who give wrong answers into a large ashtray and locks them into a
container filled with second-hand smoke. </P>

<P>An inside look at the fictional ``American Pride Tobacco Company''
and its strategy sessions for a new youth cigarette called ``Frank
Mule.'' Top executives (played by Paul Hecht and Veanne Cox) talk
about how to increase cigarette sales by enticing young people to
smoke with promotions, advertising and merchandise. In fact, the
Federal Trade Commission reports (1995) that the tobacco industry
spends more than $6 billion on marketing, advertising and promotion,
up from $2 billion in 1993. </P>

<P>A kid (actor Josh Soboslai) with multiple cigarette premiums,
nicknamed ``The Marlboro Man,'' who professes the joys of smoking
because of the ``great stuff'' he gets from companies for smoking a
quantity of cigarettes. Items he has ordered from Marlboro catalogs
include CD players, t-shirts, lanterns and baseball caps. Consumer
Reports has found that one in four kids who smoke own a premium item,
suggesting they are particularly responsive to premiums, promotions
and logos.</P>

<P>A 1991 study by the University of Georgia found that 30% of
3-year-olds and 91% of 6-year-olds could match the Joe Camel cartoon
character with the cigarette, and another 1991 study, by the
University of Massachusetts, found that nearly 98% of high-school
students recognized the character, compared with only 72% of adults.
</P>

<P>``Cigarette Breakout,'' a stop-motion puppet segment in which
packs of talking cigarettes plot to escape from the shelves of a
store. Tony Danza, Lou Diamond Phillips and Tone Loc provide voices.
</P>

<P>In interview segments, teenagers confess their addiction to
tobacco, with some admitting to starting as early as age 9. Federal
Drug Administration research indicates that the average age for
starting smoking is 14.5 years old. Consumer Reports has found that
more than three million children and adolescents smoke cigarettes,
and their main reasons for smoking are that they are easy to buy,
their friends smoke, they can't stop, and ``it's cool.'' In fact, 80%
of smoking teens say that at least one best friend smokes. Seven out
of ten high-school seniors who smoke say that they wish they'd never
started.</P>

<P>Other telling quotes from kids in the show: </P>

<UL>
   <LI>``I am not addicted; I can quit anytime I want.'' 
   
   <LI>``I've never been carded to buy smokes.'' 
   
   <LI>``I get high off cigarettes.''
   
   <LI>``I think I definitely have the right to smoke.'' 
   
   <LI>``I've tried to quit six times in the last five months. It's a
   matter of headaches, shaking, and coming outside and seeing all
   your friends smoking.''
   
   <LI>``I get winded really quickly.''
   
   <LI>``We're all gonna die sometime, might as wel have fun.'' 
</UL>

<P>The 17-year partnership between Consumer Reports and HBO has
yielded more than 30 specials. Among them are programs geared toward
children, including the award-winning ``Buy Me That! A Kid's Survival
Guide to TV Advertising'' series, which showed kids how to
discriminate fact from fiction in commercials, focusing on product
instructions, gimmicks, celebrity endorsements, and product
performance for toys, food and games. The 1990 special ``Earth to
Kids: A Guide to Products for a Healthy Planet'' demonstrated to
young people why conservation is important and how recycling can be
fun, using everyday items such as toothpaste pumps and juice boxes.
In the '80s, HBO aired the series ``Consumer Reports Presents,''
which featured advisory programs like ``The Food Show,'' ``The
Medicine Show,'' ``The All-Around-the-House Show,'' ``The Smart Buy
Show,'' ``The Dollar and Sense Show'' and ``The Car Show.''</P>

<P>``We've benefited from audiences' hunger for consumer information;
they need a relible, unbiased source to turn to in today's confusing
and sometimes misleading marketplace,'' said Joyce Newman, the
director of Consumer Reports Television and an executive producer for
all the programs. Also produced by the 60-year-old publication is a
nationally syndicated news service that is seen on more 80 stations
in the U.S. and Canada. Because Consumer Reports accepts no
advertising and tests products independently of manufacturers, their
reputation precedes them. ``Consumer Reports is America's most
trusted source of information because we are independent,'' Newman
added. </P>

John Hoffman; written by Jeff Kindley; directed by Steve Oakes. For
Curious Pictures: senior producer, Russell A. Dube; executive
producers, Richard Winkler and David Starr. For Consumer Reports
Television: executive producer, Joyce H. Newman. For HBO: senior
producer, Carole Rosen; executive producer, Sheila Nevins. </P>

Edited by John W. Farquhar, MD and Gene A. Spiller, PhD
Published in 1990 by W.W. Norton & Co. 500 Fifth Ave., NY, NY 10110
ISBN: 0-393-30803-0 Featuring testimony from 30 ex-smokers, including ex-Winston Man David Goerlitz, and Patrick Reynolds--RJ Reynolds' grandson who, unlike Doris Duke, invested his inheritance in helping others fight their addiction to tobacco.

"If only I could Quit"
Karen Casey of the Hazelden Meditation Series
ISBN:0-06-255455-7

It contains 2 main parts.  Part I is a series of ex-smokers relating their
struggle / strategies / experiences to quit smoking.  Part II is a series
of daily thoughts for a 3 month period to reflect on the process of quitting.

My favorite book however is

Pocket Book ISBN 0-671-70295-5.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Chandler's Invisible Hand or his Scale and Scope that discuss the industry.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Bureau of Corporation reports are probably the most informative works available on the industry early in this century.  It seems my estimation of "many helpful publications" a little inflated.

MacKay has worked for years to combat smoking in China, Mongolia, and other parts of Asia; she helped launch Hong Kong's aggressive antismoking program of 1987 -- including a ban on the importation or sale of smokeless tobacco -- despite pressures from U.S. Senator Robert Dole and others who threatened to retaliate with trade restrictions. MacKay notes with deserved satisfaction that Hong Kong today vies with Singapore for having the lowest prevalence of smoking in the world, though she also warns that in Asia as a whole the habit continues to spread -- and rapidly. </i></blockquote><p><center><IMG border=0 SRC="alumshort2.gif"><IMG border=0 SRC="alumshort2.gif"></a></center><p><LI><a href="http://www.tobacco.org/Graphics/bcover.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP border=1 SRC="bcover24gamma.gif"></a><strong>The Cigarette Papers </strong><ul>By Stanton A.

<hr>

<p><strong>Martin Muntor is a man with nothing to lose. Everything has been taken from him -- his family, his job, and now his life. Muntor has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.</strong></center>

<p>But he has no intention of dying a failure. Cooped up in his dreary Philadelphia row house, he promises himself somebody will pay for his pain and misery. Muntor becomes the avenging angel for all those millions who have been deceived by slick tobacco industry advertising only to fatten company profits and die in agony. His mind turns to diabolical vengeance and he develops an ingenious plot to bring down the powerful American cigarette industry.</p>

<p>Gasp! is an intense psycho-thriller, with suspense building page after page as Muntor's terrorism hits at the heart of America.</p>

<p>Tommy Rhoads is a corporate security investigator hired to find the madman and stop the carnage. He pursues Muntor in a breathtaking series of moves and countermoves across the map.</p>

<p>When Rhoads zigs, Muntor zags. The nerve-wracking tension spirals as Rhoads gets closer and Muntor continues to kill.</p>

<p>With the help of an unconventional psychiatrist, Rhoads tries to put himself in Muntor's shoes. The more he does, the more he wonders if-despite hundreds of horrific deaths -- in the end Muntor might be doing more good than harm.</p>

<p>Who prevails in the end? Muntor? Rhoads? The tobacco industry?</p>

<p>Gasp! will keep you guessing until its stunning last page.</p>

<h2>Tobacco Terrorism Thriller Comes out Smokin'</h2>
 

<P>BOOKS 10-11
<BR>By AMANDA DAVIS
<BR>Associated Press Writer

<p>The only problem with ``Gasp!'' is trying to figure out whom Hollywood will cast as the dying journalist-turned-terrorist whose vendetta against the cigarette industry kills almost 400 people.</p>

<p>Because as sure as the sun rises in the east, there will be a movie version of Frank Freudberg's novel that takes a scary look at what a terrorist could do to the tobacco industry if he put his mind to it.</p>

<p>``Gasp!'' (Barricade Books, $21) opens at the Philadelphia home of Martin Muntor, the broken-down news editor whose diagnosis of terminal lung cancer has spurred him to take revenge on the industry that his cigarette habit has supported for years. </p>

<p>His attacks are even more successful than he had anticipated, and soon the FBI and the tobacco industry's private goon squads are searching for the man who calls himself Virgil. </p>

<p>The only problem is that Virgil is good at being evil -- he avoids capture as the bodies pile up like cigarettes coming off the assembly line.</p>

<p>Enter Tommy Rhoads, a tobacco company investigator who begins to realize that he might agree with the logic, if not the end result, of what Virgil is doing.</p>

<p>Rhoads has a number of problems, including alcoholism, but he matches wits with Virgil and outsmarts the FBI as he helps track Virgil down in a conclusion that will keep readers riveted until the final page.</p>

<p>There are distractions along the way. There's a less-than-believable relationship between Rhoads and a tobacco company employee whose husband is dying of emphysema; and a positively dastardly tobacco company president whose biggest worry is what the rash of deaths is doing to his stock portfolio. </p>

<p>Hollywood's leading actors should be asking their agents about this one. If a movie version turned out to be as riveting as the book, it would be a big winner.</p>

<h3>NEWS FROM B.A.R.T. </h3>

<p> <BR>B.A.R.T. ENTERPRISES <BR>2800 N. BELTLINE BLVD. <BR>COLUMBIA, SC  29204

<P>Press Contact: Chris Barutha  803/790-0947 or <a href=mailto:cdtlbrew@aol.com>cdtlbrew@aol.com</a>

<h3>SMOKING IS NO LONGER A DIRTY HABIT WITH NIC NAP </h3>

<p>B.A.R.T. Enterprises has developed a new product called Nic Nap to eliminate nicotine stain and smell from smokers hands.      </p>

<p>Chris Barutha, B.A.R.T. president, said "Nic Nap is a product and a service that smokers can purchase.  The government, the media, and everyone else was out to get smokers.  We decided to produce a product that would satisfy smokers and the rest of the world as well.   Most people don't want to smell badly and Nic Nap is simply a product for people who care.  It's convenient, easy to use, and sensible."</p>

<p>Why use Nic Nap?    </p>

<p>With increased pressure from non-smokers, smokers have been banned to the great outdoors to enjoy their habit. Naturally, more of the cigarette that previously burned in an ashtray, is now burning in the hands of the smoker.  "Smokers are now holding the cigarette the entire time they are smoking it.  Where else are they going to put it when they are standing outside?", asked Barutha.   Nic Nap addresses this concern created by legislation and company policies.  It provides smoking consumers with a solution, a product designed with the intent to specifically eliminate their problem.                      </p>
<p>B.A.R.T. said  the cost will vary as to how consumers wish to purchase Nic Nap. It will be offerred at bulk rates to companies who wish to provide them for their employees, while consumers will be able to purchase packs of five and ten with pocket change. They said "regardless how you wish to purchase Nic Nap, it will be affordable".</p>

<p>"Nic Nap allows a smoker to fight back to the criticism they receive", B.A.R.T.'s Barutha stressed.  "This is the answer for women, business people, and whomever wants their hands to smell fresh at their own convenience."</p>

Tactics used by Dr. Chesterfield and other urban guerillas target outdoor advertising, taking action after midnight, armed with cans of spray paint. Satirical spoofs of cigarette advertising and other media events also challenge the "sophisticated, evil lies of smoking advertising." Graphic scenes showing the results of cigarette-related health hazards are used to justify illegal activities of such tobacco-protest groups as "bugger-up." </p>

<h3>Hooked On Tobacco?</h3>
<p>(Video No. 2086) 1990 Rating: No rating (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: General</p>
<p>Synopsis: This video discusses and illustrates the syndrome of tobacco dependence, and the mechanism by which smokers are "hooked" and how the body of the smoker learns tolerance.

<h3>Just For Me: I Don't Buy It</h3>

<p>Synopsis: I don't buy it is one of six student programs in Just for Me, a series that provides video and print materials on drug abuse prevention skills. In this video, Zach becomes concerned when he sees his friend Amy smoking cigarettes. Amy says she just wants to have the same kind of fun that advertising links to consumption of tobacco and alcohol. Zach consults his mother, who works in an ad agency, and she explains that the purpose of advertising is to promote a product-not tell the truth. Amy, Zach and their friend Teeter then produce a series of satirical ads for their classmates. They spoof typical ads (Cowpoke cigarettes, etc), then urge their friends to ask what products are really about-to get the facts from independent sources, such as libraries and teachers-and think about the consequences of use. </p>

<h3>Lobbying For Lives: Lessons From The Front</h3>
<p>(Video No. 898) 1988 Rating: 4.8 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: 15 years +; health professionals Synopsis: Documented events trace the lobbying and ultimate passage of the Canadian anti-tobacco bills, C-51 and C-204, on June 28, 1988. Bill C-51 bans all tobacco advertising, severely limits other tobacco promotion, mandates stronger package warning and compels tobacco manufacturers to include detailed package inserts listing all ingredients and harmful effects. Bill C-204 bans smoking in all workplaces under federal jurisdiction and brings tobacco under the Hazardous Products Act. The important lesson learned by health lobby groups is that if they are willing to learn the political ropes, mobilize their volunteers and exercise their political clout, significant legislative change can occur. Such change can reduce disease, prevent deaths, and in the long run do more for the health of Canadians than all of the hospitals in the country put together. </p>

<h3><li>Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Inage of Women</li></h3>
JEAN KILBOURNE, FILMMAKER
<br>West Newton, MA

<h3>    <li>The Hucksters </li></h3>
From <i>THE IMAGE MAKERS' IMAGE</i> by John McDonough, The Wall Street Journal, Jan 21, 1991:
<p>
<i>Then came 'The Hucksters.' Part expose, part satire, it was based
on the 1946 best seller by former Foote Cone & Belding insider Frederick
Wakeman. It had devastating credibility. Indeed, Evans, as played with
bravado by Sidney Greenstreet, was a barely disguised literary proxy for
the very real <strong>George Washington Hill, ayatollah of American Tobacco Co., which for three decades blanketed the air with Lucky Strike ads that were more like mantras than commercials.</strong>  Clark Gable is the smart, pin-stripe knight of the Kimberly Advertising Agency who dares to challenge Evans's authority with wit and taste and declines to be 'kept.'
<p>In many ways, 'The Hucksters' remains a seminal work. Its cast of petty
tyrants and jittery sycophants, of wiseacre cynics and brainwashed company men, defined the public profile of Madison Avenue. It became the matrix for most of the ad-agency fiction that followed, right on down through 'Network' and 'Nothing in Common.'</i>

<h3>    <li>Dying For a Fag </a></li></h3>
<i>I made a series of television documentaries on the subject for Independent Television and the B B C. The first, 'Dying For a Fag', was a profile of a man in his early forties called Peter who was dying from lung cancer and was prepared to talk about his fatal love affair with the cigarette, in the hope that others might avoid the same fate. Sue and 1 first met him over lunch. Peter said he had tried to stop smoking many times and had never succeeded: now when it was too late he had finally managed to give up. My wife never smoked again.</i> -- Peter Taylor, The Smoke Ring (1984).

<h4>"No Smoking" </h4>

<p>In this special episode, aired in November, 1995, Lindsay (Natalia Cigliuti) is unable to quit smoking until she has a daydream of a future that doesn't include her. Screech says, <i>It's easier to quit smoking if you've never tried.</i>

<p>The episode closes with a taped message from President Clinton about the dangers of smoking. Clinton speaks directly to the viewers by acknowledging that his words may seem like a lecture but smoking cigarettes just isn't cool. <i>I want all of you to grow up and live long, healthy lives so that you can be president someday or do whatever else you want. Remember, there are lots of cool things to do, so why do something that's not.</i>


<h3>Tobacco Under Fire</h3>
This ABC documentary was never aired.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="aadfas">Brief Review</a> by <A HREF = "http://www.io.org:80/~pete/">Pete Dako</a>
<p>as promised here is a bit more info on DYING FOR A SMOKE which stars:</p>

<p>C. Heston, Johnny Mathis,  Chuck Norris, Gregory Hines, Belinda Montgomery, Yul Brynner, Patrick Reynolds, Everett Koop, (Teen Idol) Debbie Gibson, Rick Dees,(Winston Models) David Goerlitz and David Stevens, J. William Allgood M.D., Phillip Bartlett, M.D. and others</p>


<p>Perhaps feeling guilty of PM promotions (which were not mentioned here) C. Heston does do a complete about-face. In this film he says:</p>

<p>" Smoking killed my father...cigarettes killed my father, my stepfather... and my sister and my half-brother both of whom were younger than I, some years ago..."</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>" When I came into films in 1950 almost everybody smoked. It was just...for one thing a cigarette or a cigar or a pipe is a good prop"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>" I think there will be a time when far fewer people smoke then smoke now and I look forward to that time. You have to focus on the next generation."</p>

<p>While not quite as powerful overall as the other films I mentioned recently the ending of DYING FOR A SMOKE is quite moving. It's a clip of Yul Brynner</p>
<p>saying:</p>

<p>" Now that I'm gone, I tell you... don't smoke.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just don't smoke..."</p>

<p>then in white letters on a black background, with Aarron Neville singing "Ave Maria" a long list of tobacco dead with the dates they lived beginning with</p>

<p>Yul Brynner
<br>(1920-1985)

<h3>The  Claude Moore Colonial Farm </h3>

Visitors step back in time to the year  1771,  when Virginia was an English colony and tobacco was the basis for the economy. On  this  small  farm,  visitors  can  watch  the  farmer as he follows the traditional  cycles of planting, cultivating and harvesting using the tools of the period. The farm wife looks after the domestic duties, including the children,  the  one-room  log house, the cows and chickens, and the kitchen garden.  Visitors  can  ask  questions of the family as they go about their duties; the costumed characters are happy to explain what they are doing or talk about life in the colony.

<p>An  18th-Century  Market Fair will be held on the third full weekends in May, July and October. 

<p>Open Wednesdays through Sundays from  10  a.m.  to 4:30 p.m. from mid-April until Dec. 15, except during inclement weather and  on  Thanksgiving  Day.  The  farm  is  on  Colonial  Farm Road at 6310 Georgetown  Pike,  a  half-mile  from  the intersection with Dolley Madison Boulevard in McLean. Admission is $2 for adults; $1 for senior citizens and ages 3 through 12 (younger free). Call (703)442-7557.

<h3>Butt It Out</h3>
<p>(Video No. 605) 1983</p>
<p>Rating: 5.6 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: 6-9 years; general</p>
<p>Synopsis: After hours in a testing laboratory, animal puppets are discussing the current experiment. A puppet robot joins them and offers them a cigarette. The next morning, the professor puts the robot on a treadmill to run for one hour. The robot cannot do it, but declares that it is not because he smokes. Other enactments show clear and dirty lungs, effects of second-hand smoke and why people smoke. The robot vows never to smoke again when he realizes how harmful it is. </p>

<h3>Cigarette Underworld</h3>
<p>(Video No. 845) 1987 Rating: 4.3 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: general</p>
<p>Synopsis: Dr. Alan Blum delivers a lecture on the evil cigarette manufacturers and how they manage to advertise their product even though the use of cigarettes kills many people each year. An organization called DOC has been set up to develop and use counter-advertising against the cigarette manufacturers. Dr. Blum urges his audience to become involved with DOC and to do all they can to get rid of cigarettes. </p>

<h3>Cigarettes: Who Profits, Who Dies?</h3>
<p>(Video No. 1106) 1993; 50 min Rating: 5.6 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: general; 15 years +</p>
<p>Synopsis: Wayne McLaren, the Marlboro Man, reprises his role from the advertisements that helped make Marlboro the top selling U.S. cigarette brand. Wayne also has cancer related to cigarette smoking. We also hear from Myriam, a Lucky Strike model, who now teaches her fellow laryngectomy patients how to talk again. This program is a powerful and provocative look at how advertising works to recruit smokers to replace those who die or quit. It also explores the gulf between the images and the effects of smoking as well as the efforts of the tobacco companies to expand their trade into new markets in Asia and the Pacific. </p>


<h3>Confessions Of A Simple Surgeon</h3>
<p>(Video No. 976) 1990 Rating: 5.6 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: 8 years +; general; smokers</p>
<p>Synopsis: Following years of first-hand exposure to the toll smoking takes on human lives, Australian Dr. Arthur Evans fights back. Tactics used by Dr. Chesterfield and other urban guerillas target outdoor advertising, taking action after midnight, armed with cans of spray paint. Satirical spoofs of cigarette advertising and other media events also challenge the "sophisticated, evil lies of smoking advertising." Graphic scenes showing the results of cigarette-related health hazards are used to justify illegal activities of such tobacco-protest groups as "bugger-up." </p>

<h3>Death In The West</h3>
<p>(Video No. 2018) 1976; 32 min Rating: None given (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: general 16 years +</p>
<p>Synopsis: Thames Television, under pressure from the Phillip Morris tobacco company suppressed broadcast of this documentary and it was not shown in public until 1982. It is a profile of the growth of the Marlboro brand of cigarettes to the number one position in the United States, propelled there by the rough and independent image of the cowboy. A number of the working cowboys originally shown in the advertisements are interviewed as are their physicians. Most have since died of cancer, caused by smoking the MD's assert. A senior executive and a scientist from Phillip Morris are also interviewed. Taking the opposite view the smoking of tobacco is not proven to cause cancer and that carcinogens known to be in tobacco are insignificant. </p>

<h3>Diary Of A Teenage Smoker</h3>
<p>(Video No. 2067) 1991; 26 min Rating: None given (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: women 13 to adult; smokers</p>
<p>Synopsis: "I was Desperate...I had to find one," a diarist writes of her life as a smoker. Throughout this program young women comment on their smoking habits: how they started and how they tried to quit. Most started with friends, "everyone smoked." They discuss rebellion, the need to fit in, the place of advertising and the importance of appearances. The comic Sandra Shamus comments on her smoking career and "how to smoke like a lady." Interspersed with this commentary are facts about health consequences and examples of counter advertising. </p>

<h3>Dying For A Smoke</h3>
<p>(Video No. 1182) 1994; 50 min Rating: 3.7 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: general</p>
<p>Synopsis: This documentary examines the social costs of cigarette smoking: expert profiles are given on the effects during pregnancy; on heart attacks, asthma, emphysema and other health problems. Also examined is "vote trading" in the U.S. Congress, the problem of addiction, advertising and profitability. Attitudes of European consumers and governments are outlined and celebrity testimonials from Charleton Heston and Johnny Mathis round-out the program. </p>

<h3>Feminine Mistake</h3>
<p>(Video No. 925) 1989</p>
<p>Rating: 4.0 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: women; 12 years +</p>
<p>Synopsis: A cameo appearance by actress Meridith Baxter Birney kicks off this warning of the special risks women face in relation to cigarettes. In addition to the general health hazards smoking poses, dangers to the female reproduction system and unborn babies are discussed. Cigarette advertising now targeting women promotes smoking as liberating, sexually attractive and glamorous. The truth about smoking is revealed by women whose lives have been severely damaged by cigarettes. </p>

<h3>Future Wave</h3>

<h3>Lobbying For Lives: Lessons From The Front</h3>
<p>(Video No. 898) 1988 Rating: 4.8 (6 point scale)</p>
<p>Audience: 15 years +; health professionals Synopsis: Documented events trace the lobbying and ultimate passage of the Canadian anti-tobacco bills, C-51 and C-204, on June 28, 1988. Bill C-51 bans all tobacco advertising, severely limits other tobacco promotion, mandates stronger package warning and compels tobacco manufacturers to include detailed package inserts listing all ingredients and harmful effects. Bill C-204 bans smoking in all workplaces under federal jurisdiction and brings tobacco under the Hazardous Products Act. The important lesson learned by health lobby groups is that if they are willing to learn the political ropes, mobilize their volunteers and exercise their political clout, significant legislative change can occur. Such change can reduce disease, prevent deaths, and in the long run do more for the health of Canadians than all of the hospitals in the country put together. </p>

The display seemed to confirm a prediction by the state's largest tobacco dealer, reported in an Indianapolis newspaper a few days earlier, that the trust would "buy up the whole House" before it would permit passage of the bill.

May 24, 1972: wrote memo on Philip Morris U.S.A. interoffice stationery, stating that rival brand Kool had the highest nicotine "delivery" of any king-size on the market. "This ties in with the information we have from focus group sessions and other sources that suggest that Kool is considered to be good for 'after marijuana' to maintain the 'high' or for mixing with marijuana, or 'instead." He wrote that Kool's high nicotine is a reason for its success, and that "we should pursue this thought in developing a menthol entry. . . The lessened taste resulting from the lowered tar can be masked by high menthol or other flavors. Many menthol smokers say they are not looking for high tobacco taste anyway. . . A widely held theory holds that most people smoke for the narcotic effect (relaxing, sedative) that comes from the nicotine. The 'taste comes from the 'tar' (particulate matter) delivery.  . . . Although more people talk about 'taste,' it is likely that greater numbers smoke for the narcotic value that comes from the nicotine."<li><strong>Upton, Arthur C.</strong>, </li> <li><strong>Uydess, Ian</strong></li> <p>V<p><li><strong>Varella, Luis</strong></li> <li><strong>Velcher, Gary</strong></li> <li><strong>Viscusi, W.

<p>Tobacco Products -- November 1992</a></h3>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction to enforce laws against false and deceptive advertising, including advertising for tobacco products. The FTC also has responsibility under various federal laws to insure the proper display of health warnings in advertising and on packaging of tobacco products sold in the United States. Further, the agency collects and reports to Congress information concerning cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising, sales expenditures, and the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes. This brochure provides an overview of tobacco-product laws and explains the FTC's role in enforcement.</p>

<h3><a name=aa2>Warning Labels and Advertising for Cigarettes</a></h3>

<p>The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act was designed to make Americans more aware of the adverse health effects of smoking. As enacted in 1965, the law required health warnings only on cigarette packages. In 1984, the law was amended to require that one of the four warning labels listed below appears in a specific format on cigarette packages and in most related advertising.</p>

<li>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.</p>

<li>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health.</p>

<li>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight.</p>

<li>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions in the Federal law on tobacco advertising and labeling:</p>

<p>Health warning labels on outdoor-billboard advertisements are allowed to be somewhat abbreviated from those appearing in newspaper, magazine, and product packaging.</p>

<p>Warning labels are not required on specialty advertising items (such as pens, pencils, clothing, and sporting goods) that carry cigarette company logos, brand names, or other promotional messages. These items must bear warning labels, however, if they promote smokeless tobacco products.</p>

<p>Warning labels are not required for cigars, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own cigarette tobacco.</p>

<h3><a name=aa3>Warning Labels and Advertising for Smokeless Tobacco Products</a></h3>

<p>The FTC also enforces regulations that require health warnings to appear on all packaging and in advertising for smokeless tobacco products. These requirements are authorized under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, enforced jointly by the FTC and the Department of Justice. Smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, moist snuff, and plug tobacco are used orally. The Act requires manufacturers, packagers, and importers to place one of the following warning labels on smokeless tobacco packages.</p>

<li>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER</p>

<li>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS</p>

<li>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES</p>

<p>The Act requires that the respective warnings be placed in a circle and arrow format on all forms of advertisements except billboards. The FTC has issued regulations to determine the size and format of the health warning in relation to the size of the package.</p>

<h3><a name=aa4>FTC Responsibilities for the Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Acts</a></h3>

<p>The Cigarette Act and the Smokeless Tobacco Act require manufacturers and importers to submit a packaging and advertising plan for FTC approval. The plan must provide for appropriate label rotation on packages and in advertising for each brand of cigarette or smokeless product, whether manufactured in the United States or imported here. The law requires that a health warning appear in a conspicuous location on advertisements and packaging, and the manufacturer's plan must assure an even distribution of the warning statements in all parts of the U.S. where the product is sold.</p>

<p>Both of these laws require the FTC to report to Congress. Under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, the FTC reports annually the current practices and methods of cigarette advertising and promotion. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 contains the same reporting requirements -- but on a two-year basis. This Act also requires the FTC to compile for Congress current sales figures for smokeless tobacco products.</p>

<p>Amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in 1971 and 1973 banned advertisements for cigarette and little cigar products from radio and television. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 extended the broadcast advertising ban to smokeless tobacco products.</p>

<h3><a name=aa5>Disclosure of Tobacco Product Contents</a></h3>

<p>For many years, the FTC has obtained and publicized information about the constituents of tobacco smoke, such as tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. Through these disclosures, consumers who smoke have been able to choose brands with tested lower concentrations of such substances. In addition, since 1971, all manufacturers have been voluntarily disclosing the tar and nicotine content of cigarette brands in their advertisements.</p>

<p>For More Information</p>

From the preface: <i>It is a curious fact that while the Whites took the material tobacco from the Indians they took with it no fragment of the world that accompanied it, nor were they at first aware that there was such a world. After all of the generations that have elapsed since its introduction among the Whites, it has woven itself scarcely at all into their psychology and mythology. Nicotine is enshrined among the Whites only as a drug, as a taste, as a habit, along with the seeking after mild and tasty forms, while the Native peoples make tobacco a heritage from the gods, a strange path which juts from there into this world and leads to the very ends of magic. -- Clyde Kluckholn, 1908</i><ul><li>01/12/97 And Don't miss Drake's<a href="http://rampages.onramp.net/~bdrake/cigpest.html"> Cigarettes and Pesticides Bibliography</a> A massive compilation.</ul><p><li>12/27/96 For the Native American Experience with Native American Tobacco, try Joe Winter's <a href=""> Traditional Native American Tobacco Seed Bank and Education Program (TNAT) </a> at the University of New Mexico (UNM), which has 2 goals: <i> 1) collecting, preserving, growing and distributing the seeds of the many traditional Native  American types of tobacco and 2) educating Native Americans about the dangers of tobacco misuse.</i><p><li>12/26/96 University of California's <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/srphome/trdrp/"> Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</a> <i>The Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program was established by the University of California, through legislative mandate, to manage all fiscal and programmatic aspects of the Research Account specified under Proposition 99, the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act.</i><p><li>12/24/96<a href="http://www.lib.auburn.edu/gpo/"> Government Printing Office on the Web</a> Federal Register, Bills, Public Laws, and the entire United States Code governing tobacco transactions from taxes to subsidies to imports.

Another example of tobacco contemplation as an emergent (and surprisingly personal) art form. <i>This site is dedicated to the idea that it may not be tobacco which is the cause of much, or most smoking-related disease and death. The role of chronic sublethal exposure to cigarette pesticides, the use of contaminated paper industry waste materials, the presence of hazardous solvent residues, the use of foreign tobacco wastes, and many other new avenues of evidence are explored. We suggest new product liability strategies for cigarette victims and their families, new routes to more effective community-level regulation, and new reasons for young people to understand the importance of not smoking cigarettes and using other so-called tobacco products. We also propose some interesting, maybe startling new uses for tobacco - including one that was awarded the 1993 Energy-Related Social Invention of the Year in the UK</i><p><li>12/19/96<a href="http://justdo.com/international/index.html"> International Business Directory</a> Lists of yellow & white pages, by country.<p><li>12/17/96<a href="http://www.ama.com.au/"> Australian Medical Association</a> Not much there on tobacco, but the AMA is heavily involved in the intense, decade-long <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/47338.asp"> Australian tobacco wars</a><p><li>12/16/96<a href="http://www.stopsmoke.com"> Stop Smoke</a> Uh, this is <i>a newly formed Guerrilla Operation.

<center><h2>Health Group Gives ELLE Magazine 'Poison Apple Award' For Offering Young Female Readers Prettily Packaged Death in 'ELLE Cigarette Case' 
</h2>
</center>
Priorities

<p>New York, May 1, 1996 - The American Council on Science and Health today presented the "Poison Apple Award," given for the most shocking example of promoting, endorsing and glamorizing a deadly product to ELLE Magazine for encouraging cigarette use by its young female readers. ELLE earned this award for its May issue, which on page 219 contains a promotion for "the ELLE cigarette case," billing this "handsome and sophisticated antique-like silverplated case" as "the stylish way to transport your favorite brand."

<p>Noted Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, "This goes far beyond the behavior of other women's magazines, which although almost all regrettably feature cigarette advertisements, justify this as simply accepting advertising for a legal product. By making this cigarette case an official magazine promotion, the editors of ELLE re endorsing cigarette smoking. The modern-day Snow White who takes this apple from the wicked stepmothers at ELLE won't have the benefit of Prince Charming to wake her from her sleep--either she will die before he finds her, or her smoking will have made her so unattractive that he won't want to kiss her. 

<p>Dr. William Cahan, the Senior Attending Surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and an ACSH advisor, commented, "The young women who are readers of ELLE are not being told that lung cancer recently surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer mortality in women, nor that smoking produces immediate hazards for women of childbearing age - including inhibiting fertility and dramatically increasing the risk of complications during pregnancy, birth defects, sudden infant death syndrome and cervical cancer.

<p>Added Dr. Whelan, "This product may be elegantly packaged as a 'retro-vice' that evokes an image of a glamorous past, but no amount of packaging can erase the knowledge that cigarettes are the number one cause of preventable death in the United States, or that women now make up the majority of smokers. We can only await the introduction of the ELLE snuff box and the ELLE opium pipe. For shame!

<h2><center>Schoolcraft on the Sacred Origin of Tobacco (1851-57)</h2></center>

Of the sacred origin of tobacco the Indian has no doubt, although scarcely two tribes exactly agree in the details of the way in which the invaluable boon was conferred on man. In substance, however, the legend is the same with all. Ages ago, at the time when spirits considered the world yet good enough for their occasional residence, a very great and powerful spirit lay down by the side of his fire to sleep in the forest. While so lying, his arch-enemy came that way, and thought it would be a good chance for mischief; so, gently approaching the sleeper, he rolled him over toward the fire, till his head rested among the glowing embers, and his hair was set ablaze. The roaring of the fire in his ears roused the good spirit, and, leaping to his feet, he rushed in a fright through the forest, and as he did so the wind caught his singed hair as it flew off, and, carrying it away, sowed it broadcast over the earth, into which it sank and took root, and grew up tobacco.

<p>If anything exceeds the savage's belief in tobacco, it is that which attaches to his pipe. In life it is his dearest companion, and in death is inseparable; for whatever else may be forgotten at his funeral obsequies, his pipe is laid in the grave with him to solace him on his journey to the <i>happy hunting-ground.</i> <i>The first pipe</i> is among the most sacred of their traditions; as well it may be, when it is sincerely believed that no other than the Great Spirit himself was the original smoker.

<p> Many years ago the Great Spirit called all his people together, and, standing on the precipice of the Red Pipe-stone Rock, he broke a piece from the wall, and, kneading it in his hands, made a huge pipe, which he smoked over them, and to the north, south, east, and west. He told them that this stone was red, that it was their flesh, that of it they might make their pipes of peace; but it belonged equally to all; and the warclub and the scalping-knife must not be raised on this ground. And he smoked his pipe and talked to them till the last whiff, and then his head disappeared in a cloud; and immediately the whole surface of the rock for several miles was melted and glazed. Two great ovens were opened beneath, and two women (guardian spirits of the place) entered them in a blaze of fire; and they are heard there yet, and answer to the invocation of the priests, or medicine-men, who consult them on their visits to this sacred place.

<p> The<i>sacred place</i>  here mentioned is the site of the world-renowned <i>Pipe-stone Quarry.</i>  From this place has the North American Indian ever obtained material for his pipe, and from no other spot. Catlin asserts that in every tribe he has visited (numbering about forty, and extending over thousands of miles of country) the pipes have all been made of this red pipe-stone. Clarke, the great American traveller, relates that in his intercourse with many tribes who as yet had had but little intercourse with the whites he learned that almost every adult had made the pilgrimage to the sacred rock and drawn from thence his pipe-stone. So peculiar is this <i>quarry</i> that Catlin has been at the pains to describe it very fully and graphically, and from his account the following is taken:

<p><i> Our approach to it was from the east, and the ascent, for the distance of fifty miles, over a continued succession of slopes and terraces, almost imperceptibly rising one above another, that seemed to lift us to a great height. There is not a tree or bush to be seen from the highest summit of the ridge, though the eye may range east and west, almost to a boundless extent, over a surface covered with a short grass, that is green at one's feet, and about him, but changing to blue in distance, like nothing but the blue and vastness of the ocean.

<p> On the very top of this mound or ridge we found the far-famed quarry or fountain of the Red Pipe, which is truly an anomaly in nature. The principal and most striking feature of this place is a perpendicular wall of close-grained, compact quartz, of twenty-five and thirty feet in elevation, running nearly north and south, with its face to the west, exhibiting a front of nearly two miles in length, when it disappears at both ends, by running under the prairie, which becomes there a little more elevated, and probably covers it for many miles, both to the north and south. The depression of the brow of the ridge at this place has been caused by the wash of a little stream, produced by several springs at the top, a little back from the wall, which has gradually carried away the superincumbent earth, and having bared the wall for the distance of two miles, is now left to glide for some distance over a perfectly level surface of quartz rock; and then to leap from the top of the wall into a deep basin below, and thence seek its course to the Missouri, forming the extreme source of a noted and powerful tributary, called the  Big Sioux.

<p> At the base of this wall there is a level prairie, of half a mile in width, running parallel to it, in any, and in all parts of which, the Indians procure the red stone for their pipes, by digging through the soil and several slaty layers of the red stone to the depth of four or five feet. From the very numerous marks of ancient and modern diggings or excavations, it would appear that this place has been for many centuries resorted to for the red stone; and from the great number of graves and remains of ancient fortifications in the vicinity, it would seem, as well as from their actual traditions, that the Indian tribes have long held this place in high superstitious estimation; and also that it has been the resort of different tribes, who have made their regular pilgrimages here to renew their pipes.</i>

<p> As far as may be gathered from the various and slightly conflicting accounts of Indian smoking observances, it would seem that to every tribe, or, if it be an extensive one, to every detachment of a tribe, belongs a potent instrument known as <i>medicine pipe-stem.</i>  It is nothing more than a tobacco pipe, splendidly adorned with savage trappings, yet it is regarded as a sacred thing to be used only on the most solemn occasions, or in the transaction of such important business as among us could only be concluded by the sanction of a Cabinet Council, and affixing the royal signature.

Letters

<i>(Re: HOW DO TOBACCO EXECUTIVES LIVE WITH THEMSELVES? New York Times, March 31, 1994)</i>

<p>   On July 23, 1992, one day after  my  husband's death from lung cancer, I spent a good many hours trying to persuade people at The New York Times obituary department to include the sentence, "He died of lung cancer due to cigarettes." The legal department objected to these eight words. They said there was no way to prove it; but. in my grief and anger, these eight words meant more to me than the list of credits and movies my husband had made. A few days later, The Times found a way, and my husband's obituary included the sentence, "He died of lung cancer, said his wife, who noted that he was a heavy smoker." I felt satisfied.
<p>    A few months later, after a period of deep solitude and mounting, I decided to venture out into the world and went to the gala opening of the Matisse exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. The first thing I saw when I entered was a large sign that said the exhibit had been underwritten by Philip Morris. It felt like a fist in the face.
<p>    I'd been to many cultural events underwritten by Philip Morris and it had always made me feel vaguely uncomfortable, but I'd always rationalized my discomfort by thinking, "At least they're doing some good with some of their profits." Now rationalizations didn't work anymore. Your headline said it succinctly: "They spread the amazing wealth and, with it, their grim responsibility."
<p>    Yes, my husband should have quit smoking, as millions  of  people  have.  I watched him try many times -- using hypnosis, acupuncture, electronic beepers that help you cut down, even cold turkey -- but he could never stick to it. Was he just weak? No, he wasn't. He was highly disciplined, hard working and strong willed. He was also addicted to a powerful drug that he had been using since he was 12 years old, back in the good old days when the cigarette companies were allowed to tell us how good cigarettes were for us. Did he know it was harmful? Of course he did, but like millions of others he found this drug habit very hard to break and so he rationalized, too--until it was too hte.
<p>    That night, at the museum opening, I bitterly wondered out loud if the museum would  have proudly displayed a sign stating that the Matisse exhibit had been underwritten by some notorious drug lord or mafioso don. My friends gently reminded me that "drugs aren't legal and cigarettes are."
<p>    At this time, it is socially, economically and emotionally convenient to rationalize the politics of cigarettes, but only until you or someone you love is forced by circumstance to walk into a crowded oncology waiting room.    <p>   CAROLYN MARKS BLACKWOOD New York, NY

<center><h2>Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612-1776</h2></center>
          <i>It was the "staple" of the Chesapeake colonies in a broader sense than any other staple the world has known.  For, in the ancient province, all the processes of government society and domestic life began and ended with tobacco.</i>[1]  

<p>In 1612 John Rolfe, an Englishman sent with the Virginia Company, found that tobacco would grow well in Virginia and sell profitably in England.  This was wonderful news considering that many of the Jamestown colonists had died or suffered miserably as their farming efforts had been relatively unsuccessful.  Throughout Virginia and the greater Chesapeake, the potential cash value of tobacco soon captivated the imaginations of the colonists.  They began to plant it in every available clearing, from fields to the forts and streets of Jamestown, and eventually to much of Tidewater Virginia.[2]  "Dominating the Virginia economy after 1622, tobacco remained the staple of the Chesapeake colonies, and its phenomenal rise is one of the most remarkable aspects of our colonial history."[3]</p>

<p>As gold and silver became scarce, and the use of wampum was terminated because of its complications, the Chesapeake colonies were able to rely on tobacco as a means of currency.  Tobacco was the safest and most stable currency that the Chesapeake colonies had or could have, and it always had a value in exchange for gold.[4]</p>

<p>As economic subsidiaries of England, the Chesapeake Colonies were bound by the mercantile system.  This system enabled England to receive raw goods from the colonies, turn them into finished goods, and market them to the rest of the world.  </p>

<p>In exchange for providing England with seemingly endless supplies of natural resources, the colonies were forbidden any production or trade outside of this arrangement.  As the desire for tobacco grew in England, and the need for supplies grew in the colonies, the colonists were able to trade equally for goods from England without having to worry about the scarcity of the product.  Thus, by necessity, it became the leading item of commerce with England.[5]</p>

<p>In addition to being employed for purchasing goods, the tobacco currency was also used to pay fines and taxes. For example, <i>persons encouraging Negro meetings were to be fined 1000 pounds of tobacco; owners letting Negroes keep horses were fined 500 pounds tobacco; if a person wanted to become married, he had to go to the rector of his parish and pay the man so many pounds of tobacco; a man's wealth was estimated in annual pounds of tobacco.</i>[6]</p>

<p>Tobacco also affected the government as all laws were made more or less with reference to it: to protect it, and to maintain its value in price, so that many of the civil and some of the criminal processes, were affected by it.  </p>

<p>Tobacco provided the colonial governments of Virginia and Maryland with one of their principal sources of revenue.  A duty of two shillings, or about 20 cents, levied on each hogshead of tobacco exported from those colonies yielded Virginia 3,000 pounds, or $4,541 in 1680, and  6,000, or $9,082, a year during 1758-1762.  In Maryland the proceeds were steady at 2,500 pounds, or $3,784, a year from 1700.[7] </p>
          
<p>As the tobacco colonies' populations increased, so did their production of tobacco.  With the rise in production of the staple crop, exports to England rose drastically. Imports of tobacco into England increased from 60,000 pounds in 1622 to 500,000 pounds in 1628, and to 1,500,000 pounds in 1639.  By the end of the seventeenth century, England was importing more than  20,000,000 pounds of colonial tobacco per year.  </p>
<p>Despite this growth in tobacco production, problems in price-stability and quality existed.  In 1660, when the English markets became glutted with tobacco, prices fell so low that the colonists were barely able to survive.  In response to this, planters began mixing other organic material, such as leaves and the <i>sweepings from their homes,</i> in with the tobacco, as an attempt to make up by quantity what they lost by low prices.  The exporting of this <i>trash tobacco</i> solved the colonists' immediate cash flow problems, but accentuated the problems of overproduction and deterioration of quality.[8]</p>

<p>As the reputation of colonial tobacco declined, reducing European demand for it, colonial authorities stepped in to take corrective measures.  During the next fifty years they came up with three solutions.  First, they reduced the amount of tobacco produced; second, they regularized the trade by fixing the size of the tobacco hogshead and prohibiting shipments of bulk tobacco;  finally, they improved quality by preventing the exportation of <i>trash tobacco.</i>  These solutions soon fell through because there was no practical way to enforce the law.  It was not until 1730, when the Virginia Inspection Acts were passed, that tobacco trade laws were fully enforced.[9],[10]  </p>

<p>The memorable Inspection Acts revolutionized tobacco regulation and became a permanent feature of trade until the War for Independence.  The Inspection Acts established public warehouses with official inspectors and required planters to transport every hogshead of tobacco in the colony to a warehouse for inspection.  The inspectors were empowered to break open each hogshead, remove and burn any trash, and issue tobacco notes to the owner specifying the weight and kind of tobacco.[11],[12]	</p>
<p>After 1730, Marylanders became aware that the inspection system gave Virginia a great advantage over Maryland by raising the quality and reputation of its' tobacco.  In 1747 the Maryland assembly passed the Maryland Inspection Acts which remained a permanent feature of the trade in Maryland.</p>

<p>The system worked like this: if the planter turned in his tobacco "loose" or in bundles he received a receipt known as a <i>transfer note,</i> which entitled the holder to a certain number of pounds of tobacco drawn at random from the total stock of transfer tobacco.  Transfer tobacco was derived from several sources.  It often happened that after filling his hogsheads, a planter had an insufficient quantity left over to fill another.  This excess was usually delivered to the warehouse, where the planter would receive a transfer note to cover it.  The clergy, innkeepers, artisans, and others, whose main occupation was something other than tobacco planting, often tended a small patch in their spare time in order to meet the various country and parish levies, and to make purchases in local stores.  The people carried their small quantities to the warehouse and received transfer notes that could either be sold or tendered as payment of debts, fees, and taxes.[13],[14]</p>

<p>There were two major kinds of tobacco present in the Chesapeake colonies; Oronoco and Sweetscented.  Each was distinguished by its different thickness, texture, and shape of the leaf.  The Oronoco leaf was bulkier, coarser, and had a sharper look <i>like a fox's ear</i>.  The Sweetscented leaf was rounder and had finer fibers.  Oronoco, which was grown all around the Bay, was stronger in flavor, while Sweetscented, which was grown on the banks of the James, York, Rappahannock, and Potomac rivers, had a milder taste.  Sweetscented was considered the best in the world and as a result it brought a better price than Oronoco.  However, Oronoco, which was thought to be too strong for the Englishmen, was in great demand in the rest of Europe.  For that reason Oronoco, although inferior by English standards, came to have a much wider market than the Sweetscented, and was usually more profitable to planters.[15]  </p>

<p>Although less strenuous than many other occupations, tobacco production was not without its anxieties and dangers.  The planter always ran the risk of crop failure, loss from improper curing and prizing.  This detailed attention caused a laborer to cultivate no more than 3 or 4 acres of plants.  In addition, like other agricultural products, tobacco was greatly affected by the weather.  A dry spell in the spring or fall delayed planting.  On the other hand, an extreme wet spell drowned the tobacco and ruined the crop by causing the leaves to spot.[16],[17]  </p>

<p><i>It neither supplied food to him nor fodder to his beasts; it could not yield him roof-timber nor firewood.  He had to shelter, watch over, nurse it at every stage of growth and curing, for never was there a more tender plant or one subject to a greater variety of plagues, diseases, and disasters</i>.[18]  The preparation and sowing of a tobacco seed bed was a process <i>as elaborate as the making of pillow-lace</i>[19]; the weather, a fly, a dozen various accidents, may have defeated a planters prospects of a supply of plants.  Not until the summer came, after a year of growing the delicate tobacco and until seventeen months had elapsed, were the planter's troubles over.  Then at last he brought his crop to market, had it sampled, and sold it for half the price he expected to get for it.</p>
<p>Another increasing problem was that tobacco was extremely exhausting to the soil.  After three years of being harvested, the tobacco had exhausted the soil of its nutrients, leaving much of the land worn out and of no use to farmers.  For example, in Montgomery county, by 1783 much of the land had become a relatively barren landscape thus forcing many people to move on in order to have any opportunity of succeeding economically. In order to solve the need for more land, many settlers bribed the Native Americans into taking pots and pans and other various items that the natives had never seen before.  In exchange for these novelties, the natives lost control of ancestral lands in and around the Chesapeake region.  As a result, the colonists were able to take away the natives' land without much resistance.[20],[21]  </p>
<p>In Maryland's slavery-dominated southern counties, "instead of homes or barns,... settlers invested much of their money in an institution that was an important element of the contemporary landscape--slavery</i>.[22]  Slaves served as the backbone of the tobacco economy.  Without them there would have been no one to till the ground, plant the seeds, raise the plants, harvest, and cure the tobacco.  In some areas slave populations grew from 7% to 35% of the Chesapeake regions' population between 1690-1750. For example, situated between the Patuxent and Potomac rivers, (what is now Rock Creek Park in Northwest, Washington DC), had a huge slave population. </p>
<p>Despite some opposition to slavery, by the time of the Revolution, slavery was both politically and socially accepted.  To compensate for their inability to purchase land, many farmers became tenants on the properties of larger land holders such as the prestigious Hopkins, Dulaney, Ridgely, and Carroll families.  For tobacco planters, buying a slave often made sound economic sense, considering how rapidly tobacco exhausted land.  Instead of land, they bought laborers whom they could move when their rented acreage became infertile.  So long as slave labor existed, a <i>crop</i> of tobacco paid all advances.[23],[24]</p>
<p>Certainly the success of tobacco cultivation brought economic prosperity to the Chesapeake colonies.  Without tobacco, it can be argued, the colonists might have been left to subsistence farming and had little if any opportunity for economic growth independent of England.  That nearly anyone could grow "cash" in his or her backyard, to pay off debts and taxes, implies the high demand for tobacco as a means of stabilizing the economy.  From the point of view of the colonists, the negative legacies of displacement of the natives, slavery, and land loss were more than compensated for by the incredible economic growth experienced by the enterprising white men.  In fact, long term effects of tobacco production were not a major concern of the white settlers until after World War II.</p>

<i>Huron Indian myth has it that in ancient times, when the land was barren and the people were starving, the Great Spirit sent forth a woman to save humanity. As she traveled over the world, everywhere her right hand touched the soil, there grew potatoes. And everywhere her left hand touched the soil, there grew corn. And when the world was rich and fertile, she sat down and rested. When she arose, there grew tobacco . . .</i>[25]

The lessened taste resulting from the lowered tar can be masked by high menthol or other flavors. Many menthol smokers say they are not looking for high tobacco taste anyway. . . A widely held theory holds that most people smoke for the narcotic effect (relaxing, sedative) that comes from the nicotine. The 'taste comes from the 'tar' (particulate matter) delivery.  . . . Although more people talk about 'taste,' it is likely that greater numbers smoke for the narcotic value that comes from the nicotine."</a></li><p>    <li>1973: Surgeon General's report finds cigar and pipe smokers' health risks to be less than cigarette smokers, but more than nonsmokers.</LI>    <li>1973: Civil Aeronautics Board requires all airlines to create nonsmoking sections.

The Agricultural Adjustment Act guarantees price supports in exchange for limiting production via allotments and quotas; so long as farmers didn't grow past their seasonally allotted acreage, the government would buy the unsold tobacco. The plan is dependent on close communication with manufacturers, and their upcoming buying needs. The bill has undergone many amendments over the years, the most important being the 1938 bill authorizing marketing quotas and the 1949 act authorizing price supports.<li>1935: The Tobacco Inspection Act is enacted by Congress. This act established the framework for development of official tobacco grade standards, authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to designate tobacco auction markets where tobacco growers would receive mandatory inspection of each lot of tobacco to determine its grade and type, and provided for the distribution of daily price reports showing the current average price for each grade. The Agricultural Marketing Service's Tobacco Division was established to provide these services to the industry.

I found a man alone in a canoe who was going from the island of Santa Maria to Fernandina. He had food and water and some dry leaves which must be a thing very much appreciated among them, because they had already brought me some of them as a present.</i><p>The leaves were tobacco. A few weeks later, coming ashore on another island, Columbus saw natives who <i>"drank smoke."</i> <p>In 1494, Romano Pane, the friar who accompanied Columbus, reported that the Indians also used tobacco by reducing it to a powder that <i>"they take through a cane half a cubit long: one end of this they place in the nose, and the other upon the powder."</p></i>--from The Facts About Smoking, Consumer Reports Books, 1991<p>The Arawak tribe of the Caribbean smoked both cigars and used the tobago, a soapstone pipe.

In the West Indies it has several names, according to the different places where it grows and is used, but the Spaniards generally call it tobacco. Its leaves are dried, made into powder, and then smoked by being sucked through clay pipes into the stomach and head. The fumes purge superfluous phlegm and gross humors from the body by opening all the pores and passages. Thus its use not only preserves the body, but if there are any obstructions it breaks them up. By this means the natives keep in excellent health, without many of the grievous diseases which often afflict us in England.</p><p>"This uppwoc is so highly valued by them that they think their gods are delighted with it. Sometimes they make holy fires and cast the powder into them as a sacrifice. If there is a storm on the waters, they throw it up into the air and into the water to pacify their gods. Also, when they set up a new weir for fish, they pour uppwoc into it. And if they escape from danger, they also throw the powder up into the air. This is alwavs done with strange gestures and stamping, sometimes dancing, clapping of hands, holding hands up, and staring up into the heavens. During this performance they chatter strange words and utter meaningless noises.</p><p>"While we were there we used to suck in the smoke as they did, and now that we are back in England we still do so. We have found many rare and wonderful proofs of the uppwoc's virtues, which would themselves require a volume to relate. There is sufficient evidence in the fact that it is used by so many men and women of great calling, as well as by some learned physicians."</p></i>--Thomas Hariot,  A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, directed to the investors, farmers, and well-wishers of the project of colonizing and planting there. Imprinted at London in 1588.<p>Hariot was part of a group sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to establish the first English colony in the New World. He spent a year on Roanoke Island, 1585-1586.</p><p>Most of the members of the party fitfully searched around for gold, and complained "because they could not find in Virginia any English cities, or fine houses, or their accustomed dainty food, or any soft beds of down or feathers." But Hariot, who would be recognised in later years as a preeminent scientist, took accurate stock of the land and its bounties, and is reputed to have carried back with him on Sir Francis Drake's ship two strange plants: tobacco, and the potato.</p><p>The piece quoted above is part of a compendium of "commodities" he wrote to help maintain interest in Raleigh's doomed attempts to make money out of his expeditions to the New World--the English explorations then were very much commercial ventures.</p><p>After Hariot's return to England, he met and became great friends with Raleigh, and was his main contact with the outside world during the 13 years Raleigh spent in the Tower of London (where he grew his own tobacco).</p><p>Raleigh was beheaded in 1618, and reportedly had a pipeful just before going to the gallows.</p><p>Hariot suffered terribly from a "cancerous ulcer of the nose" from 1615 till his death 6 years later at the age of 61.</p><hr><h3>   <li>1590: LITERATURE: <a name=aafq> Spenser's Fairy Queen: earliest poetical allusion to tobacco in English literature.</a> </h3>Belphoebe includes tobacco with other medicinal herbs gathered to heal Timais (Book III, Canto VI, 32).<i><BLOCKQUOTE><p>Into the woods thenceforth in haste shee went,<br>To seeke for hearties that mote him remedy;<br>For she of hearties had great intendiment,<br>Taught of the Nymphe which from her infancy<br>Her nourced had in trew nobility:<br>There, whether yet divine Tobacco were,<br>Or Panachea, or Polygony,<br>She fownd, and brought it to her patient deare<br>Who al this while lay bleding out his hart-blood scare.</i></BLOCKQUOTE><hr><h3><a name=1book>1595: ENGLAND: The first book in the English language devoted to the subject of tobacco is published</a></h3><i>The first book in the English language devoted to the subject of tobacco was anonymously published in 1595, by Anthony Chute.

James also said if he ever had the Devil to dinner, he'd offer him a pipe.</p><p>With regards to second-hand smoke, James said, <i>" "The wife must either take up smoking or resolve to live in a perpetual stinking torment."</i></p><p>On the other hand, James' was the first government to find taxes on tobacco to be enormously profitable. Trying to stamp out smoking, he first increased taxes on tobacco 4,000%, from 2 pence/pound to six shillings, 8 pence/pound. That stopped people from buying tobacco, but dried up the funds that had been coming into the Treasury. James then slashed taxes down to 2 shillings/pound and watched the money pour in. Other governments were quick to learn the same lesson.</p><p>From George Arents:<p><i>In 1604, there was published [in England], anonymously, the most famous of all tracts opposing the social use of tobacco, A Counterblaste to Tobacco, by King James.</p><p>The king reiterated his contempt for those who daily used a drug for pleasure, scorned the acceptance of a habit adopted from unbaptized barbarians [Indians in the Americas], bewailed the cost of what he called this "precious stink," and repeated some of the tales of hoor then used to frighten smokers.  Among other things, he reminded his readers that some great tobacco-takers were found, upon dissection, to have lungs and brains covered by fine, black soot, obviously the result of smoking!</p><p>I should like to make a brief digression here to point out that, as James' subjects didn't accept his advice, he promptly raised the tobacco duty by four thousand percent.  But within two years he found it profitable to reduce the duty and lease of monopoly of that tax.  Thus he received a large income from the sale of the very thing he professed most to despise.</p><p>As a result of the high duty placed upon tobacco (a duty which was continually advanced during James' and Charles I's reign), a state arose similar to our own, during prohibition days.  The common phrases and conditions of that era are also applicable to the tobacco trade in London then; the commodity was "free of duty"; sold by smugglers as "right off the ship"; the dandies knew where the best stuff was to be secretly had; domestic tobacco was doctored to give it the semblance of "Spanish," and the wide advertising smoking received, because of the campaign against it, induced many men and women, who had never smoked before, to take up the custom.</p></i>-- George Arents, "Early Literature of Tobacco," privately printed for distribution at The Library of Congress, 1938.

The first permanent English colony was established in 1607, when the Virginia Company landed another ill-prepared group of adventurers in Jamestown. This sad colony--wracked by malaria epidemics, Indian attacks, intrique, laziness, torture, starvation and cannibalism--could well have failed also, but was arguably saved not just by Pocahontas, but by her husband John Rolfe's cultivation of tobacco.</p><p>Without the success of Jamestown, the dominant culture everywhere south and west of New England could well be Spanish. <hr><h3><a name=aa6>1847: LONDON: Philip Morris Opens Shop; sells hand-rolled Turkish cigarettes.</a></h3><hr><h3><a name=aa7>1880: Bonsack Machine is awarded patent</a></h3><p>1880: 21-year-old Virginian James Albert Bonsack is granted a patent for his cigarette-rolling machine. <p>The cigarette market was small then; cigarettes were expensive and hand-rolled by the cigarette girls. Most manufacturers didn't see a use for that many cigarettes. </p><p>The Bonsack machine had been seen and discarded by the established cigarette manufacturers. In 1883, 27-year-old Buck Duke leased the Bonsack machine on a favored contract. By 1887, once Duke and Bonsack's mechanics had finished tinkering with it, it was capable of reliably rolling 120,000 cigarettes in 10 hours.</p><p>This not only takes the cigarette business out of the hands of the cigarette girls, it means that cigarettes can be made cheaply enough to satisfy a mass market.</p><p>But the market didn't exist. If he wanted to unload his stockpiling cigarettes, Duke had to create the market, and he used unique and spectacular promotions and advertising campaigns to do it.</p><p>The pressures created by the invention of the Bonsack machine led not only to the widespread use of cigarettes as America's favored form of tobacco, but to the modern era of mass-market advertising and promotion.</p><hr><h3><a name=aapm>1902: Tiny Philip Morris sets up a corporation in New York to sell its British brands, including <i>Philip Morris, Blues, Cambridge, Derby,</i> and one named after the street its London factory was on, <i>Marlborough.</i></a></h3>Marlboro is targeted towards women, and features a red tip to hide lipstick marks.<hr><h3>1905: POLITICS: <a name=aaindiana>Indiana legislature bribery attempt is exposed,</a> leading to passage of total cigarette ban</li></h3><i>In 1905, a clumsy attempt at bribery virtually forced the Indiana legislature into prohibiting cigarettes.

Little's life work lay in the genetic origins of cancer; he tended to disregard environmental factors. <p>From the complaint filed by the state of Florida in its 1995 lawsuit against tobacco companies:</p><blockquote><p>59. In response to the publication of Dr. Wynder's study in 1953, the presidents of the leading tobacco manufacturers, including American Tobacco Co., R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, U.S. Tobacco Co., Lorillard, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation- ration, hired the public relations firm of Hill and Knowlton, Inc., to deal with the "health scare" presented by smoking. Acting in concert, at a public relations strategy meeting, the participants decided to organize a committee to be specifically charged with the "public relations" function.  . . . As a result of these efforts, the Tobacco Institute Research Committee ("TIRC"), an entity later known as The Council for Tobacco Research ("CTR"), was formed.</p><p>60. The TIRC immediately ran a full-page promotion in more than 400 newspapers aimed at an estimated 43 million Americans. That piece was entitled "A Frank Statement To Cigarette Smokers" . . . </p></blockquote><i><p>A FRANK STATEMENT TO TOBACCO SMOKERS:</p><p>RECENT REPORTS on experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings.</p><p>Although conducted by doctors of professional standing, these experiments are not regarded as conclusive in the field of cancer research. However, we do not believe results are inconclusive, should be disregarded or lightly dismissed. At the same time, we feel it is in the public interest to call attention to the fact that eminent doctors and research scientists have publicly questioned the claimed significance of these experiments.</p><p>Distinguished authorities point out:</p><p>That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer.</p><p>That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is.</p><p>That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.</p><p>That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life.

At one time or another during those years critics have held it responsible for practically every disease of the human body. One by one these charges have been abandoned for lack of evidence.</p><p>Regardless of the record of the past, the fact that cigarette smoking today should even be suspected as a cause of a serious disease is a matter of deep concern to us.</p><p>Many people have asked us what we are doing to meet the public's concern aroused by the recent reports. Here is the answer:</p><p>We are pledging aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health. This joint financial aid will of course be in addition to what is already being contributed by individual companies.</p><p>For this purpose we are establishing a joint industry group consisting initially of the undersigned. This group will be known as TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCH COMMITTEE.</p><p>In charge of the research activities of the Committee will be a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national repute. In addition there will be an Advisory Board of scientists disinterested in the cigarette industry. A group of distinguished men from medicine, science, and education will be invited to serve on this Board. These scientists will advise the Committee on its research activities.</p><p>This statement is being issued because we believe the people are entitled to know where we stand on this matter and what we intend to do about it.</p></i> <p>*******<p>From <i>The Facts about Smoking</i>(Consumer Reports Books</p><p>The [tobacco] industry also created the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC). Although the stated purpose of the TIRC was to encourage research on smoking, its chief accomplishment was to put forward the idea that scientists themselves held differing opinions about whether or not smoking was dangerous. For example, in 1954, a front-page article in The New York Times reported that a majority of doctors and scientists attending the American Cancer Society meeting believed that smoking caused cancer, but in the third paragraph of the article a representative of the TIRC is quoted as saying that the poll was "biased, unscientific and filled with shortcomings." In 1954, when Drs. Graham and Wynder reported that tobacco tar painted onto the skin of mice caused cancer, the TIRC countered with: "Doctors and scientists have often stressed the many pitfalls present in all attempts to apply flatly to humans any findings resulting from animal experiments. " Whatever the validity of the TIRC's criticisms, they served to encourage skepticism in the public's mind about scientific reports of the dangers of smoking. The tobacco industry also established the Tobacco Institute, whose avowed purpose was to promote "public understanding of the smoking and health controversy and . . . knowledge of the historic role of tobacco and its place in the national economy." In the first issue of Tobacco News, the institute's president said: "The Institute and this publication believe that the American people want and are entitled to accurate, factual, interesting information about this business [tobacco] which is so important in the economic bloodstream of the nation and such a tranquilizer in our personal lives."  <p>*******<p>From <i>PR Watch</i>:</p><p>Hill & Knowlton's role is described as follows in a 1994 lawsuit, State of Mississippi vs. the Tobacco Cartel:</p><p>The presidents of the leading tobacco manufacturers ... hired the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton ....  As a result of these efforts, the Tobacco Institute Research Committee (TIRC), an entity later know as The Council for Tobacco Research (CTR), was formed.</p><p>The Tobacco Industry Research Committee immediately ran a full-page promotion in more than 400 newspapers ... entitled "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers."... The participating tobacco companies recognized their "special responsibility" to the public, and promised to learn the facts about smoking and health ...  to sponsor independent research on the subject ....    to cooperate closely with public health officials ....</p><p>After thus beginning to lull the public into a false sense of security concerning smoking and health, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee continued to act as a front for tobacco industry interests. Despite the initial public statements and posturing, ... there was a coordinated, industry-wide strategy designed actively to mislead and confuse the public about the true dangers associated with smoking cigarettes. Rather than work for the good of the public health, ... the tobacco trade association, refuted, undermined, and neutralized information coming from the scientific and medical community.</p><p>There is no question that the tobacco industry knew what scientists were learning about tobacco. The TIRC maintained a library with cross-indexed medical and scientific papers from 2,500 medical journals; as well as press clippings, government reports and other documents. TIRC employees culled this library for scientific data with inconclusive or contrary results regarding tobacco and the harm to human health. These were compiled into a carefully selected 18-page booklet, titled "A Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy," which was mailed to over 200,000 people, including doctors, members of Congress and the news media.</p><p>*******<p>From <i>Merchants of Death</i>: by Larry C. White</p><p>The year 1954 marked the beginning of the cigarette Big Lie. It was in this year that the cigarette companies got together to plot the strategies that would keep them viable far into the future, strategies that still guide their response to the fact that their products kill 10 percent of their customers.</p><p>Speaking frankly to investors in June of 1954, O. Parker McComas, then president of Philip Morris, said that the health problem must be taken seriously--that is, "carefully evaluated for its effect on industry public relations, as well as its effect on the consumer market." Therefore, he said, Philip Morns had joined with "practically all elements of industry" to form the Tobacco Industry Research Committee. There were great expectations for the TIRC: "We hope that the work of TIRC will open new vistas not only in research, but in liaison between industry and the scientific world." As for the nature of the TIRC, McComas said that it was similar to other industries' organizations such as the American Meat Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, and so on.</p><p>This was not for consumption by the general public, of course. An ad was run in newspapers across the country on January 4, 1954, that announced the formation of the TIRC and touted the committee's objectivity. "In charge of the research activities of the Committee will be a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national repute. In addition, there will be an Advisory Board of scientists disinterestedin the cigarette industry. A group of distinguished men from medicine, science, and education will be invited to serve on this Board. These scientists will advise the Committee on its research activities."</p><p>***<p>There would be no pro-cigarette studies funded by the committee--fakes would be too easily discredited. Instead, research would be done around the periphery--keeping scientists busy on incidental issues, diverting attention from the main point: the link between cigarettes and disease. For example, one of the committee's first priorities was funding of studies on why people smoke. Another favored area for research was whether some people have a genetic predisposition to cancer. This could keep scientists busy indefinitely.<p>Still, it was obvious that independent scientists would continue to investigate the health effects of smoking. . . The basic public relations strategy was to emphasize the few studies that did not prove that smoking caused disease. What could never be mentioned was that a study that does not prove a relationship between smoking and disease cannot logically prove the opposite--that no relationship exists. . . With the advent of the TIRC, the cigarette companies could say that no one spent more on research on smoking and health than they did. Most important, the TIRC would serve the function of creating a controversy. The current name of the committee is the Council for Tobacco Research and it still serves the function of making it seem like there is a valid difference of opinion among scientists about whether smoking is dangerous.</p><p>The value of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee to the industry was revealed only a few months after its creation. At a meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in early June of 1954, the American Cancer Society announced that a majority of cancer researchers, chest surgeons, and pathologists believed that smoking might lead to lung cancer. This news was carried on the front page of The New York Times on June 7, 1954. But, unlike pre-1954 articles that had allowed the news to stand alone, this article included in its third paragraph a denunciation of the statement.</p><p>Timothy V. Hartnett, chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, called the poll of doctors "biased, unscientific and filled with shortcomings."</p><p>***<p><p>In February of 1956, Dr. Evarts A. Graham reported on another study in which he had painted mice with tobacco tars. He had been criticized for his earlier study of this kind because he had used only one type of mouse. In this new study he used other strains and also painted rabbits' ears with the tars. Again, he induced cancer.</p><p>This time the industry was ready for him--thanks to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee. When newspapers reported Dr. Graham's study they also reported the response of the TIRC: "Doctors and scientists have often stressed the many pitfalls present in all attempts to apply flatly to humans any findings resulting from animal experiments." To a scientist, the response was worthless, but it was enough to cast doubt in the public's mind. Most important for the industry, the TIRC provided smokers with some ammunition, some arguments that justified their not quitting.</p><hr><h3><a name=aayeaman>1963-07-17: LITIGATION: B&W's General Counsel Addison Yeaman writes in a memo, ''"Moreover, nicotine is addictive.

Kennedy had won the 1960 Presidential election by only 0.1 percent of the vote. His vice-president, Lyndon Johnson had successfully delivered the crucial Southern vote. Kennedy had an ambitious program to implement, and was fully aware many congressional committees were dominated by tobacco state legislators.<p>Yet the 1962 Royal College of Physicians' Report increased public pressure on Kennedy to take a public stand. At a press conference on May 23, 1962, Kennedy said in reply to a question on the subject, "That matter is sensitive enough and the stock market is in sufficient difficulaty without my giving you an answer which isnot based on complete information, which I don't have, and, therefore, perhaps I will be glad to respond to that question in more detail next week."<p>Kennedy soon acceded to American health groups' long-standing request to create a Presidential Commission to study the matter.<p>Surgeon General Luther Terry worked closely with the tobacco industry on the commission. The industry was presented with a list of 150 "outstanding medical scientists" and were allowed to cross out any names they wished. Terry remembers only 3 or 4 were so eliminated. Industry views were made known to the committee members.<p>The scientists worked for a year in a sub-basement of the Nataional Library of Medicine in Bethesday, MD., and when their report was to be printed, it received the same clasification as a state secret.<p>On a Saturday morning, January 11, 1964, at 9 AM,  200 reporters were physically locked into the State Department's auditorium to hear a two hour briefing by surgeon general Dr. Luther L. Terry and a panel of experts. The top-secret measures were felt necessary because of the bold and closely-guarded conclusion reached in the brown paperback book they received titled <i>Smoking and Health.</i><p>When the press conference was over, the reports ran to the telephones "like flushing ducks off a pond." In 1964, in a country where over 50% of adult males smoked, a multi-billion dollar industry seemed to hang by the book's astounding verdict: smoking causes cancer. The report stated that <i>Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action.</i><p>At the time, 46% of all Americans smoked; smoking was accepted in offices, airplanes and elevators, and TV programs were sponsored by cigarette brands.<p>Within 3 months of Terry's report, cigarette consumption had dropped 20%, but, as was the pattern in England following the Royal Physicians' Report, was soon to climb back with a vengeance.<p>"It was a very dramatic and courageous thing to do," said Joseph Califano, the top domestic policy aide to then-President Johnson.<p>But the Johnson Administration had enough wars--domestic and foreign--to fight. The Administration didn't want to pull its resources from poverty and civil rights to undertake action which would undoubtedly entail severe social, economic and regional disruptions. "We wanted to get schools integrated, the voters' rights act passed, fair housing passed. And all of those things required us to take on the whole phalanx of Southern states," Califano said.<p><strong>Smoking rates since 1965, from National Health Interview Surveys compiled by the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health.</strong><p><pre>% US Adult <br>Smokers in:   % ALL % Men % Women<p>1965 42.4 51.9 33.9<br>1966 42.6 52.5 33.9<br>1970 37.4 44.1 31.5<br>1974 37.1 43.1 32.1<br>1976 36.4 41.9 32.0<br>1977 36.0 40.9 32.1<br>1978 34.1 38.1 30.7<br>1979 33.5 37.5 29.9<br>1980 33.2 37.6 29.3<br>1983 32.1 35.1 29.5<br>1985 30.1 32.6 27.9<br>1987 28.8 31.2 26.5<br>1988 28.1 30.8 25.7<br>1990 25.5 28.4 22.8<br>1991 25.7 28.1 23.5</pre><hr><h3><a name=atombomb>1964: Industry writer suggests tobacco control advocates <i>have psychiatric certification that they are not sufering from pyrophobia</i> and <i>suppressed fear of the 'big fire' or atom bomb</i></a></h3>1964: USA: In response to the release of the Report to the Surgeon General in Jan. 1964, "World Tobacco" magazine published a two page article (pp. 19-20) titled "International perspective on smoking and health" in the March 1964 issue.

Delayed for one day to allow a final glut of Super Bowl ads, the Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, which included a nationwide ban on tobacco advertising on television and radio, went into effect at midnight. Fairness Doctrine anti-smoking ads also disappear. Cigarette sales begin rebounding from their four year decline.</p><p>The bill also required an updated warning on cigarette packages: "Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health."</p><p>The tobacco industry is reputed to have been hard-hit by the counter-ads required by 1967's Fairness Doctrine, which undoubtedly influenced their acceptance of this legislation. Feeling betrayed, advertising, broadcasting and publishing interests fought a losing battle.</p><p>The industry's advertising expenditures decreased over the next two years, but the industry soon found other venues in which to market: sports promotion, point-of-sales promotions, and increased use of the print medium.</p><p>RJ Reynolds' top-selling Winston brand, which had been eclipsed in the 60s by Philip Morris' Marlboro, was particularly hard-hit. While the sales impact of the Marlboro cowboy translated into print beautifully, Winston's identifier was a catchy if notedly ungrammatical jingle, "Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should."</p><p>Reynolds never found an effective visual substitute for their jingle. </p><p>Throughout the 70s Reynolds became distracted with myriad diversification missteps, and developed business practices which led to shelves full of stale Winstons.</p><p>Philip Morris quickly became the number one tobacco company in the US, and its Marlboro brand became the number one best-selling cigarette..</p><hr><h3><a name=aabrc>1971: UK: Second British Royal College of Physicians of London Report, <i>Smoking and Health Now</i></li></a></h3><p><strong>From <i>Smoking and Health Now</i>:</strong><p><i>The suffering and shortening of life resulting from smoking cigarettes have become increasingly clear as the evidence accumulates.

White:</p><p>Take the case of Olympic diver Greg Louganis. He trained for the 1984 Olympics (where he was to win two gold medals) at the Mission Viejo training center in southern California. Mission Viejo had been the home of the top American swimmers and divers, including Mark Spitz, who won seven gold medals at the 1972 Olympics.</p><p>The swimming club, and the town in which it is located, is owned by a subsidiary of Philip Morris called the Mission Viejo Realty Group.</p><p>Greg Louganis was born in 1960. By the time he was eight years old he had started to smoke. He said to a congressional committee studying cigarette advertising, "Smoking was more of a way of rebelling than something I enjoyed. I thought I was cool and that it would make me more grown up--like my parents who both smoked. I thought that my neighborhood pals would accept me if I joined the guys every day outside school to sneak a smoke. By the time I was in junior high, I was hooked on these deadly products, and I was willing to risk whatever future I might have had as a diver and an athlete, all to get my daily fix of those little tobacco sticks. I know now from reading the statistics on nicotine addiction and smoking habits that 85 to 90 percent of smokers start before or during their teenage years. As a diver I kept rationalizing that I didn't need a great amount of wind to succeed, just power and strength."</p><p>Louganis continued to smoke until he was twenty-three, even though he had to do it surreptitiously: "My diving coach at the time, Dr. Sammy Lee, would never coach me again if he ever found out that I had even contemplated the idea of smoking cigarettes." But then one day he had a personal epiphany that enabled him to quit smoking: "I had been practicing at the Mission Viejo facility one day and on the way out I noticed this twelve-year-old kid smoking. When I asked him why, he said that he wanted to be just like me! He knew I smoked and he figured that it did not seem to affect my diving performance, so he thought it must be all fight to smoke. At that point I began to question what I was doing, and I quit smoking. I realized that in a way I was a 'Marlboro Man' of sons ....  "</p><p>Louganis later told me, "After I quit I wanted to tell every twelveyear-old that I had quit." So he started doing volunteer work for the American Cancer Society. According to his manager, Jim Babbitt, the Mission Viejo executives were not very happy about this: "They grimaced when the ACS was mentioned."</p><p>And they warned Louganis to "keep a low profile." "1 was very disappointed," he says. "Number one, I was acting as an individual and I don't feel that it was right for the company to have the power to say, 'Don't say this, it's against what our company is selling.' Maybe they could say that I was biting the hand that fed me, but I believe that there is a higher value."</p><p>Louganis's activities that the Mission Viejo executives and their masters at Philip Morris on Park Avenue found so displeasing reached a crescendo in January of 1984. In that Olympic year, Louganis was asked by the American Cancer Society to be national chairman of its annual Great American Smokeout. Babbitt was very enthusiastic. He told me, "I was pushing for it heavily. I thought this would have made Greg a hero in other areas than diving. It would have been a real coup for him, a great move for Greg and his career. And, after all, he's told me that he considers quitting smoking the greatest accomplishment of his life." An athlete of his stature in that position would have a major effect on the image of smoking among young people.</p><p>But it was not to be. Babbitt got the message from the public relations department of Mission Viejo. If Greg were to accept the honorary position from the American Cancer Society, he would be barred from training at Mission Viejo. "It was done very subtly, very polished. But also very definite." Louganis's coach, Ron O'Brien, was the best in the world. The diver could not contemplate competing in the Olympics without his guidance. But O'Brien worked for Mission Viejo.</p><p>Babbitt says the threat of Louganis's being sent away from Mission Viejo, away from his coach, was the sports world's equivalent of saying, "I'll kill your mother." And it didn't stop there. Two of the public relations people told Babbitt that if Louganis accepted the Cancer Society invitation, they too would be fired. "Heads would roll," Babbitt says.</p><p>Both Louganis and Babbitt agreed that there was really no choice. The diver declined the honorary position so that he could go to the Olympics. Of course, he could not explain why, at the time, since even this would have been considered a hostile act.</p><p>The most ironic footnote to this story is that after his great success in Los Angeles in the 1984 Olympics, his first offers for endorsement contracts came from tobacco companies, and a PM subsidiary. Louganis rejected them without discussion.</p><p>[Note: the only major endorsement Louganis landed was from swimwear manufacturer Speedo. Their association continues today. Speedo appears to be aware that Louganis has AIDS.]</p><HR><p><h3></h3></p><h3><a name=aaa149>1991-02-07: AUSTRALIA: The AFCO Case: Federal Court examines 1986 ETS studies, finds data valid</a></h3>Transcripts:<p><ul><li><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp.pl/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/unrep4662.html?query=Tobacco+Institute+AND+Morling">THE 1991 AFCO Decision<i> ...there is a strong public interest in the respondent being preventedfrom making the statement that there is little evidence and nothing whichproves that cigarette smoke causes disease in non-smokers.  Active smokers are likely to be misled or deceived by the statement into believing that theirsmoking does not prejudice the health of non-smokers, particularly small children. Non-smokers are likely to be deceived or misled by the statement into believing that cigarette smoke does not affect their own health or the health of their children.   These are serious matters. </i> -- Justice Trevor Morling, Australian Federal Court, February 7, 1991<p>In 1986, the Tobacco Institute of Australia ran newspaper ads that claimed there was "little evidence and nothing which proves scientifically that cigarette smoke causes disease in nonsmokers."</p><p>The Australian Federation of Consumer Organizations (AFCO) brought suit in Australian Federal Court under the Trade Practices Act.</p><p>Heavy guns and major resources of both sides were thrown into the case, which lasted 30 months. 320 reports were presented, including evidence from noted ETS-critic and Cato Institute lecturer Gary Huber (The financial connection between Huber's work and the tobacco industry was not revealed until Business Week broke the story in 1994).</p><p>The main evidence for the plaintiffs were reports from 1986 by the US Surgeon General, the National Research Council (US), the National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) and the Froggatt inquiry into health and smoking (Britain).</p><p>The court found that even in 1986 there was "overwhelming evidence" that ETS triggers respiratory attacks in children, and "compelling scientific evidence that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer in non-smokers."</p><p>In a 211-page judgement, the court found that the TIA's advertised statement breached the Trade Practices Act and was likely to mislead people on the effects of ETS. Justice Trevor Morling granted an injunction which prevented the Tobacco Institute from running similar ads.</p><p>The Journal of the American Medical Association said in reference to the case,</p><i><p>"It is not surprising that the tobacco industry, which for decades has continued to obfuscate the causal link between smoking and disease despite massive evidence, should feel threatened by studies that show that nonsmokers may be harmed and killed by their products. After all, in 1991, the evidence that ETS causes lung cancer was reviewed and found, by a federal court in Australia, to be 'compelling.' And it's not surprising that scientist-editors at JAMA, who have read the evidence on both sides, believe that ETS is a great danger to nonsmokers and are depressed by industry tactics. . .</p><p>"It is interesting that the judge in the Australian case was generally critical of the narrow approach of the statistical experts called by the Tobacco Institute of Australia, and their tendency to be 'overcritical' of parts of every study while sometimes demanding "unattainable standards" of proof of causation. He was more favorably impressed by the broader approach of the epidemiologists, who stressed the importance of the pattern that emerged from all these studies - studies 'supported by strong biological plausibility.'"</p></i><HR><h3><a name=aa7execs>1994-04-14: Seven Tobacco Company executives begin testimony in Congressional hearings</a></h3>The officers who appeared before Henry Waxman's (D-CA) Committee beginning April 14, 1994, were: <br>William Campbell, CEO, Philip Morris<br>James Johnston, CEO, RJR Tobacco Co<br>Joseph Taddeo, President, U.S. Tobacco Co<br>Andrew Tisch, CEO, Lorillard Tobacc<br>Thomas Sandefur, CEO, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co<br>Ed Horrigan, CEO, Liggett Group<br>Donald Johnston, CEO, American Tobacco Co.<p>The following was the most famous exchange:<p>REP. WYDEN: Let me ask you first, and IÕd like to just go down the row, whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive. IÕve heard virtually all of you touch on it--yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?<br>WILLIAM I. CAMPBELL (Philip Morris): I believe that nicotine is not addictive, yes.<br>REP. WYDEN: Mr. Johnson...<br>JAMES JOHNSTON (RJReynolds): Uh, Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definition of addiction. There is no intoxication--<br>REP. WYDEN: WeÕll take that as a no. And again, time is short, if you can just, I think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive, IÕd just like to have this for the record.<br>JOSEPH TADDEO (US Tobacco): ÒI donÕt believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.Ó<br>ANDREW TISCH (P Lorillard): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.<br>EDWARD HORRIGAN (Ligget Group): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.<br>THOMAS SANDEFUR (Brown & Williamson): I believe that nicotine is not addictive.<br>DONALD JOHNSTON (American Tobacco Co.): And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive.<h3><a name=aa150>1994-05-31: FTC Clears Joe Camel</a></h3>1994-05-31: the FTC votes 3-2 not to file a complaint that the R.J. Reynolds "Joe Camel" advertising campaign encourages children to buy cigarettes. Two commissioners issued strongly dissenting opinions.<p>"Although it may seem intuitive to some that the Joe Camel advertising campaign would lead more children to smoke or lead children to smoke more, the evidence to support that intuition is not there," a commission statement said.<p>   Commissioners Mary L. Azcuenaga, Deborah Owen and Roscoe Starek III voted against taking any further action. Dennis Yao and Chairwoman Janet Steiger issued strongly dissenting statemtents:<p>"I have reason to believe that the Camel campaign induced underage people to start smoking and that proceedings against such ads would be in the interest of the public," Steiger said.<p>Yao said, "There is evidence that the carton character has appeal to minors and that Camel has increased its market share among minors. There is also evidence that the decade-and-a-half decrease in smoking among minors has slowed down in the time since the Joe Camel campaign began."<p>The FTC's province was to determine not if the ads encouraged kids to smoke, but whether the ads encouraged kids to do something illegal--_buy_ cigarettes. <p>The Commissioners were forced to act under pressure from attorneys general of 27 states (who urged a ban in Sept. of 1993), the Surgeon General Antonia Novello, and the entire FTC staff (in August of 1993) urging them to ban Joe Camel.<p>The FTC seemed unwilling to address First Amendment legal issues that are, in the words of one observer, "on the periphery of settled law . . . I think it's an ugly baby that showed up on their doorstep. They don't know what to do with it."<p>While the decision was pending--with 2 Commissioners having already voted to ban, and the others hanging fire--another observer,  Art Amolsch, publisher of the newsletter FTC:Watch, said, "It is a volatile issue, and I have a feeling there are some commissioners who would prefer not to vote, not to go on the record on this."<p>Had the FTC voted against the campaign, the matter would then have been turned over to an Administrative law judge, leading to a case that probably would have dragged on for years.<p>Fred Danzig, editor of the trade weekly Advertising Age, said, "We long ago called for RJR to kill the campaign on their own . . . Whether they're right or wrong is hardly the issue anymore because the public perception is that RJR is trying to lure kids to cigarette smoking simply by using a cartoon character."<p>Some issues that keep the pot stirring:<p>In 1991, 3 years into the campaign, over half of 3-6 year olds recognized Joe Camel, more than recognized Mickey Mouse or Ronald McDonald. 91% of six-year-olds match Joe Camel with his product, and Camel's share of the kid market had jumped by a factor of 50.<p>Nicholas Price, the British creator of the image (for an adult magazine in France in 1974), has said he is "mortified" that the character is being used to target kids.<p>After a 15 year decline, youth smoking rose in 1988--the first full year of the Joe Camel campaign.<hr><h3><a name=aa151>1995-07-21 Two reports find alarming increases in cigarette smoking among minors in the US:</a></h3>    <li><i>Trends in Smoking Initiation Among Adolescents and Young Adults -- United States, 1980-1989 (CDC)</i></li>    <li><i>The Monitoring the Future Study</i> (Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan.

<p><center><h2>Of the Tabaco and of His Greate Vertues</h2>
</center></p>

<Font Size=+1><p>THIS herb, which commonly is called tobacco, is an herb be of much antiquity, and known amongst the Indians, and in especially among them of the new Spain, and after that those countries were gotten by our Spaniards, being taught of the Indians, they did profit themselves of those things, in the Wounds which they received in their Wars, healing themselves therewith, to the great benefit of them</p>

<p>Within this few years there  has been brought to Spain of it, more to adorn Gardens with the fairness thereof, and to give a pleasant sight, rather then that it was thought it had the marvelous Medicinal virtues which it hash, now we do use of it more for his virtues then for his fairness. For surely they are. such which put admiration</p>

<p>It is growing in many parts of the Indies, but ordinarily in moist places, and shadow places, and it is needful that the ground where it is sown, be well tilled, all that it be  fruitful ground in all times it is sown, in the hot countries. But in the collide countries it must be sown in the month of March, for that it may defend it self from the frost</p>

<p>The proper name of it amongst the Indians is Pecielt, for the name of Tobacco is given to it of our Spaniards, by reason of an land that is named Tobacco</p>

<p>It is an Herb that does grow and come to be very great: many times to be greater then a Lemon tree, it does cast out one stem from the Root which grows up right, without declining, to any parts, he does cast out many Bowes, straight that well new they be equal with the principal stem of the tree, his Leaf is well nere like to the Leaf of a Sydron tree, they come to be very great, and be of color green, the Plant is heavy, they be in the Garden as Sidrons and Oranges are. For that all the year they are green, and have leaves, and if any wither, they be those that are lowest, in the highest parts of all the Plants, there does grow out the flower, the which is after the manner of white Campanillia, and in the middest of Carnation color, it has a good show when it is dry, it is like to black Poppy seed, and is it is shut up the seed which is very small, and of the color of a dark Tauny.</p>

<p>The Root is great, conformable to the greatness of the Plants, divided into many parts, and it is like to wood in substance, the which being parted, it has the heart within, like unto the color of Saffron, and being tossed, it has some bitterness with it. The Rind comes away easily, we know not that the root has any virtue at all.  Of only the Leaves we know the virtues, I which we will speak of, although that I do believe that the root has Medicinal virtues  enough, the which the time shall discover. And some will say that it has the virtue of Rhubarb, but I have not experimented it as yet, they do keep the leaves after they be dry in the shadow for the effects that we will speak of, and they be made powder, for to use of them in place of the Leaves, for it is not in all parts, the one and the other, is to be kept a great time, without corruption, his complexion  is hot and dry in the second degree, it has virtue to heat and to dissolve, with some binding and comforting  it gleweth together, and does soder the fresh wounds, and does heal them, the filthy wounds and sores it does cleanse and reduce them to a perfect health, as it shall he spoken of foreword, and so we will speak of the virtues of these Herbs, and of the things that it does profit, every one particularly</p>

<p>This Herb Tobacco has particular virtue to heal griefs of the head, and in especially coming of cold causes, and so it cures the headache when it comes of a cold humor, or of a windy cause, the Leaves must be put hot to it upon the grief, and multiplying them the time that is needful, until the grief be taken away. Some there be that do anoint them with the Oil of Oranges, and it does a very good work</p>

<p>In any manner of grief that is in the body or any part thereof it helps, being of a cold cause, and applied hereunto it takes it away, not without great admiration</p>

<p>In griefs of the breast it does make a marvelous effect, and in especially in those that do cast out matter and rottenness at the mouth, and in them that are short breathed. And any other old evils making of the herb a seething and with Sugar made a Syrup, and being taken in little quantity, it does cause to expel the Matters, and rottenness of the breast marvelously, and the smoke being taken at the mouth, does cause that the matter be put out of the breast, of them that do </p>
<p>In the grief of the stomach, caused of cold causes, or wince, the leaves being put very hot, it does take it away, and dissolves it by multiplying of them, until it be taken away. And it is to be noted, that the leaves are to be warmed better then any other, amongst Ashes or Embers very hot, thrusting the herbs into them, and so to warm them well, and although they be put to with some Ashes, it makes the work better, and of more strong effects</p>

<p>In Opilations of the stomach, and of the inner parts principally, this herb is a great remedy; for that it does dissolve them, and consumes them, and this same it does in any other manner of Opilations or hardness, that is in the belly, the cause being of a cold humor, or of windiness</p>

<p>They must take the herb green, and stamp it, and with those stamped leaves rub the hardness a good while,  and at the time as the Herb is in the Mortar a stamping, let there be put to it a few drops of Vinegar, that his work may be made the better, and after the place is rubbed where the pain is, then put upon it one leaf or leaves of the Tobacco being hot, and so let it alone till the next day, and then do the like again, or in place of the leaves put a Linen clothe wet, in the hot Juice. Some there be, that after they have rubbed it with the stamped leaves, they do anoint it with ointments, made for the like evils, and upon it they put the leaves or the juice of the Tobacco. And surely with this cure they have dissolved great and hard opilations, and very old swellings. In the grief of the stone, of the Kidneys and Raines, this Herb does great effects, by putting the leaves into Ashes, or Embers, hot, that they may warm well, and then being put upon the grief, multiplying it as often as it is needful. It is necessary in the Seethinges that is used to be made for Glisters to put into them with the other hinges, the Leaves of this Herb: for that they shall profit much, and likewise for Fomentations and Plasters, that they shall make</p>

<p>In griefs of winces they make the like effect, taking away the pains that does come of the windiness, applying the Leaves after the same sort as it is stated</p>

<p>In the grief of women, which is called the evil of the Mother, putting one leaf of this herb Tobacco very hot, in the manner as it is stated, it does manifest profit: it must be put upon the Navel. And under it some does use to put first of all, things of good smell upon the Navel, and then upon that they put the leaf, in that they do find most profit, is to put the Tacamahaca, or the oil of liquid Amber, and Balsam, and Carana, any thing of these put to the Navel, and kept to it continually, that it may cleave unto it, does manifest profit in griefs of the Mother</p>

<p>In one thing, the women that dwell in the Indies, do celebrate this herb, that is in the evil breathing at the mouth of children, when they are over filled with meat, and also of great people, anointing their bellies with lamp oil, and putting some of those leaves in ashes hot to their bellies, and also to their shoulders, it does take away their naughty breathing: and it does make that they go to the stool, putting it hereunto, the times that it is needful, if the leaves be ashes it is the better</p>

<p>In Worms, and in all kind of them, it kills them, and does expel them marvelously, the seething of the herb made a syrup delicately, taken in very little quantity, and the juice thereof put on the navel, it is needful after this be done to give a Glister, that may void them out, and expel them out of the guts</p>

<p>In griefs of the Joints being of a cold cause it makes a marvelous work, the Leaves of this Tobacco being put hot upon the grief, the like does the Juice put upon a little clothe hot. For that it does dissolve the humor, and takes away the pains thereof, if it be a hot cause it does hurt, saving when the humour has been hot, and the subtle is dissolved, and the gross remains. that then it does profit as if the cause were cold, and it is to be understood, that the leaves being put, where as is grief of the said cause, in any part of the body, that it will profit much</p>

<p>In swellings or in cold Impostumes, it does dissolve and undo them, washing them with the hot Juice, and putting the beaten leaves, after they be stamped, or the leaves being whole of the stated Tobacco upon it</p>

<p>In the Tooth ache when the grief is of a cold cause, or of cold Rumes, putting to it a little Ball made of the leaf of the Tobacco, washing first the soothe with a small clothe wet in the Juice, it takes away the pain, and does stay it, that the putrefaction go not forward: in hot causes it does not profit, and this remedy is so common that every one heals</p>

<p>This Herb does marvelously heal the Chilblaines, rubbing them with the stamped leaves, and after putting hands and Feet in hot water, with Salt, and keeping them warm, this is done with great experience in many</p>

<p>In Venom and venomous Wounds our Tobacco has great experience, which has been known a little time past, that when the wild people of the Indies, which an eat mans flesh do shoot their Arrows, they do anoint them with an herb or Composition made of many poisons, with the which they do shoot at all things that they would kill, and this Venom is so evil, and pernicious, that it kills without remedy, and they that be hurt die with great pains and accidentes, and with madness, unless that they had found remedy for so great an evil. A few years past they did put to their Wounds Sublimatum, and so were remedied, and surely in those parts they have suffered much with this in vexation of poison</p>

<p>A little whiles past, certain wild people going in their Boats to Saint Jhon Depuerto Rico, for to shoots at Indians, or Spaniards, if that they might find them, they came to a place and killed certain Indians, and Spaniards, and they did hurt many, and as by chance there was no Sublimatum at that place to heal them, they did remember to put upon the wounds the Juice of the Tobacco, and the Leaves stamped. And God would, that putting it upon the hurts, the griefs, madness, and accidents, wherewith they died, was mitigated, and in such sort they were delivered of that evil, that the strength of the Venom was taken away, and the wounds were healed, of the which there was are great admiration, the which being known by them of the Land, they do use it in other hurts and wounds, that they do take when they do fight with the wild people, and now they have no fear of them, by reason they have found so great a remedy, in a thing so desperate</p>

<p>This Herb has also virtue against the Herb called of the Crossbow shooter, that our hunters do use h to kill the wild beasts with all, which herb is venom most strong, and does kill with out remedy, the which the king's pleasure was to prove, he did command to make experience thereof, and they did wound a little Dog in the throat. And did put forthwith in the wound the herb of the Crossbow shooter, and after a little while, they put in to the self same wound that they had anointed with the Crossbow shooters Herb, a good quantity of the Juice of Tobacco, and the stamped leaves upon it, and they tied the dog, and he escaped not without great admiration of all men that saw him. Of the which the excellent Physician of the Chamber of his majestic the Doctor Barnarde in the margin of this book, that saw it, by the commandment of his Majesty, said these words. I did this experience by the commandment of the king's Majesty, I did wound the Dog with a knife, and after I did put the crossbow shooters herb into the wound and the herb was chosen, the dog was taken of the herb, and the Tobacco and his Juice put into the wound, the dog escaped and remained whole</p>

<p>In the venomous Carbuncles, the Tobacco being put  in the manner as is said does extinguish the malice of the venom, and it does that which all the works of Surgery can do, until it be whole. The same thing it does in biting of venomous beasts, for it does kill and extinguish the malice of the venom, and heals them.  </p>

<p>In wounds newly hurt and cuttings, strokes, pricks,  or any other manner of wound, our Tobacco does marvelous effects. For that it does heal them and makes  them sound, the wound must be washed with wine, and procure to anoint the sides of it, taking away that which is superfluous, and then to put the Juice of this herb, and upon it the stamped leaves, and being well bound it shall stand until the next day that they shall return to dress it, after the same fashion they shall keep good order in their meat, using the diet necessary, and if it be needful of any evacuation by stool, the cause being great, let it be done what shall be convenient. And  with this order they will heal, without any need of any more Surgery then this herb. Here in this Country, and in this City they know not what to do, having cut or hurt themselves, but to run to the Tobacco, as a most ready remedy, it does marvelous works, without any need of other Surgery, but this only herb. In restraining the flux of blood of the wounds it does most marvelous works, for that the Juice and the Leaves being stamped, is sufficient to restrain any flux of blood</p>

<p>In old Sores it is marvelous the works and the effects that this Herb does, for it heals them wonderfully, making clean and mundifiyng them of all that is superfluous, and of the rottenness, that it hash, and does bring up the flesh, reducing them to perfect health, the which is so common in this City that every man does know it, and I having ministered it to many people as well men as women, in great number, and being grieved of ten, and of twenty years they have healed old rotten sores in legs, and other parts of the body, with only this remedy to the great admiration of all men</p>

<p>The order of the Cure that is to be healed with this herb is this following. The old rotten sores although t they be cankered, let the sick man be purged with the counsel of a Physician, and let him blood if it be needful, and then take this Herb and pound it in a Mortar, and take out the Juice and put it into the Sore, and then after the manner of a Plaster put the stamped leaves upon it which are the Leaves that the Juice is taken out of, and this do once every day eating good Meats, and not exceeding in any disorder, for otherwise it will not profit. And doing this it will make clean the evil flesh being totter, and superfluous, until it come to the whole flesh, and is not to be marveled if that the wound be made very great. For the evil must be eaten up, until it come to the good, and with the same cure putting less quantity of juice it will incarnate, and reduce it to perfect health, in such sort that it does all the works of Surgery, that all the Medicines of the world may do, without having need of any other manner of medicine</p>

<p>This work does cure ode Sores, with so much admiration: and not only in men, but in brute beasts. As at this day in all parts of the Indies, where you have any cattle having wounds or gaules and the country being hot and moist over much, it does soon rot them, and very quickly come to be cankered, and for this cause, much great cattle do dye. And to remedy this and the worms that do increase in the sores, they had for remedy to put into the sores Sublimatum: for that in this remedy they did find more benefit then in any other, that they  had used. And for that the Sublimatum had there so high a price, many times it was more worth then the cattle that it healed. And for this cause and for having found in the Tobacco so much virtue for to heal new wounds and rotten, they did accord and agree together to use the Tobacco, in the healing of beasts, as they had done in the cure and remedy of men, putting the Juice of the Tobacco into the wounds, and washing it therewith, and putting upon it the stamped leaves of the Tobacco, after that the Juice is taken from it, and it is of so great efficacy and virtue, that it kills the worms, and makes clean the sore, eating away the evil flesh, and it does engender new flesh until it be whole, as in the other things which we have spoken of, the like it does in the gaules of the beasts of Carriage, the Juice being put and the beaten leaves whereof the Juice comes of the Tobacco, as it is said: although it be cankered, it does make them clean, and does incarnate them, and cures and helps them. And so the Indians do carry it, when they do journey, for this purpose and effect, and it does the like profit, that the juice does</p>

<p>I saw a man that had certain old sores in his nose, whereby he did cast out from him much matter, and daily did rot and canker, and I caused him to take at his nose the juice of this Tobacco, and so he did, and at the second time, he did cast out from him, more then twenty little worms, and afterward a few more, until that he remained clean of them, and using it so certain days, he did heal of the sores, that he had in the inner part of his nose: and if he had tarried any longer, I think that there had remained nothing of his nose, but all had been eaten away, as it does happen to many, which we do see without them. And being writing of this, a daughter of a gentle man of this City, had many years a certain manner of dry scabs, or well near scurvy in her head, I had cured her, and done unto her many benefits, universal, and particular: and also Masters of Surgery had done their diligence, and all did not profit. And a gentlewoman, which had the charge of her, as she heard me say one day, much good of the Tobacco that it did good, and was profitable, for so many infirmities, she sent for it, and did rub hard the decease that the wench had, and that day she was very evil, and was as though she had been foolish, and the gentlewoman did not let, in seeing her after that sort to rub her harder, and then the wench did not feel so much grief, but that the dry scabs began to fall, and the white scruff of her head in such sort, it did make clean and healed her head, with doing of it certain days, that she healed of her scurvy decease very well, without knowing what she did</p>

<p>One of the marvels of this Herb, and that which does bring most admiration, is, the manner how the priests of the Indies did use of it, which they did in this manner: when there was amongst the Indians any manner of business, of great importance, in the which the chief gentlemen called Casiques, or any of the principal people of the Country, having necessity to consult with their Priests, in any business of importance: then they went and propounded their matter to their chief Priest, forthwith in their presence, he took certain leaves of the Tobacco, and cast them into the fire, and did receive the smoke of them at his mouth, and at his nose with a Cane, and in taking of it, he fell down upon the ground, as a dead man, and remaining so, according to the quantity of the smoke that he had taken, and when the herb had done his work, he did revive and awake, and gave them their answers, according to the visions, and illusions which he saw, whiles he was rapt of the same manner, and he did interpret to them, as to him seemed best, or as the Devil had counseled him, giving them continually doubtful answers, in such sort, that howsoever it fell out, they might say that it was the same, which was declared, and the answer that they made</p>

<p>In like sort the rest of the Indians for their pastime, do take the smoke of the Tobacco, for to make them selves drunk withal, and to see the visions, and things that do represent to them, wherein they do delight: and other times they took it to know their business, and success, because conformable to that, which they had seen being drunk therewith, even so they might judge of their business. And as the Devil is a deceiver, and has the knowledge of the virtue of Herbs, he did show them the virtue of this Herb, that by the means thereof, they might see their Imaginations, and visions, that he has represented to them, and by that means does deceive them</p>

<p>To have Herbs that have the like virtue, is a common thing, and in the book of the Physicians, Dioscorides does say, that one dram of the root of Solatro, being taken in wine, which root is very strange, and furious, does provoke sleep greatly, and does make him that takes it, to dream of things variable, and does represent unto him terrible imaginations, and visions, and others does give delectation, and pleasure. Of the Anise seed they say, being eaten at the hour, when that they shall sleep, it does make a pleasant, and delectable dream. The Readishe does make them grievous, and very heavy, and of so many other herbs, which shall be large to speak of, the which of this matter, the ancient writers does write of</p>

<p>Diego Gratia de Guerta, in the book that he wrote of the Spicery and Drugs of the Oriental Indies, does say, that in those parts there is an Herb, which is  called Bague, the which being mingled with things of  sweet smell, they make of it a confection of excellent smell and taste: and when the Indians of those parts, will deprive them selves of judgment, and see visions that does give them pleasure, then they take a certain quantity of this confection, and in taking of it, they remain deprived of all judgment, and while the virtue of their Medicine does endure, they do receive much delight, and they do see things, whereby they do receive pleasure, and be glad of it. There was a mighty Emperor, being Lord of many Realms, stated unto Martine Alfonso de Sofa, viceroy that was of the East India that when he would see Realms, and Cities, and other things, of the which he did receive pleasure, that he would then take the Bague, made in a certain confection, and that in doing of it, he did receive pleasure. The use of this confection is very common, and very much used amongst the Indians of those parts, and they do sell it in the public market, for this effect</p>

<p>The Indians of our Occidental Indies, do use of  the Tobacco for to take away the weariness, and for to take  lightsomnesse of their labor, which in their Dances they be so much wearied, they remain so weary, that they can scarcely stir: and because that they may labor the next day, and return to do that foolish exercise, they do take at the mouth and nose, the smoke of the Tobacco, and they remain as dead people, and being so, they be eased in such sort, that when they be awakened of their sleep, they remain without weariness, and may return to their labor as much more, and so they do always, when they have need of it: for with that sleep they do receive their strength and be much the lustier</p>

<p>The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, has taken the same manner and use of the Tobacco, that the Indians have, for when they see themselves weary, they take it at the nose, and mouth, and it does happen unto them, as unto our Indians, lying as though they were dead three or four hours: and after they do remain lightened, without any weariness, for to labor again: and they do this with so great pleasure, that although they be not weary, yet they are very desirous for to do it: and the thing is come to so much effect, that their masters do chasten them for it, and do burn the Tobacco, because they should not use it, whereupon they go to the desserts, and secret places to do it, because they may not be permitted, to drink themselves drunken with Wine, and therefore, they are glad to make then selves drunken with the smoke of Tobacco:  I have seen them do it here, and happen to them as is stated.  And they do say, that when they come out of the same trance, or dream, they find themselves very lusty, and they do rejoice to have been after the same sort and manner, saying that thereof they do receive no hurt</p>

<p>These barbarous people do use of the like things, to take away weariness, and not only it is used in our Occidental Indies, but is also a common thing in the Oriental Indies. And also in the Portugal Indies, for this effect, they do sell the Opium in their Shops, even as they sell Conserva, with the which the Indians do use to ease them selves, of their labor that they do take, and to be merry, and not to feel pains, of any great labor of the body, or of mind that may come unto their,, and they call it there amongst them selves Aphion. Of this Aphion the Turks do use for this effect. The Soldiers and Captains that go to the wars, when they do labor much, from the time that they be lodged, that they may take rest, they take Aphion, and sleep with it, and they remain lightened of their labor: The most principal people takes the Bague, and it has a better taste, and a better smell, there is put to it much Amber, and Musk and Cloves, and other spices: That surely it is a thing of admiration, to see that these Barbarous people do take such Medicines, and so many of them do take it, and that it does not kill them, rather they take it for health and remedy, for their necessity</p>

<p>I saw an Indian of those parts, that in my presence did ask Apothecary a quart of Opium, and I asked him wherefore he would have it, and he told me that he took it to put away weariness, when he did feel him self over much grieved, and afflicted with labor, and he took the half of that as he carried, for the Apothecary gave him more then a pint for twelve pence, and therewith he slept so much, that when he awoke from sleep, he found him self very much eased of his weariness, in such sort, that he might continue his labor. I did marvel at it, and it seemed to me a thing of mockery: seeing that five or six grains, be the most that wee can give to a sick person, how strong so ever that he be, and this being very well prepared, does cause many times accidentes of death. And many years after standing in the Shop of an other Apothecary of this City, there called an other Indian, of the same Oriental Indies, and he did ask of the Apothecary, that he should give him Aphion, the which Apothecary understood him not, and I remembering myself of the other Indian, I caused him to show to the Indian Opium, and in showing it to him, he stated that it was that, which he asked, and he bought a quarter of a Pint of it, and I asked of the Indian, wherefore he would have it, and he told me the same that the other Indian did: that it was because he might labor, and ease him self of his weariness and that he did bear burdens, and that he should help to discharge a Ship: wherefore he would take the one half that he might therewith labor, and the other half after he had labored, that therewith he might take ease, and rest. Then I gave credit to the first Indian, of that he stated unto me, and since I have believed that, which I have seen, and read, in those parts to be a thing in common, for the like effects. And truly it is a thing worthy of great consideration, that five grains of Opium does kill us, and three score does give them health, and rest</p>

<p>The Indians does use the Tobacco, for to suffer the dryness, and also for to suffer hunger, and to pass days with out having need to eat or drink, when they shall travel by any dessert, or dis-peopled Country, where they shall find neither water, nor meat. They do use of these little balls, which they make of this Tobacco, they take the leaves of it, and do chew it, and as they go chewing of them, they go mingling with them certain powder, made of the shells of Cockles burned. and they go mingling it in the mouth all together, until that they make it like to dough, of the which they make certain little balls, little greater than Peason, and they put them to dry in the shadow, and after they keep them, and use them in this form following</p>

<p>Then they use to travail by ways, where they find no water nor meat: They take a little ball of these, and they put it between the lower lip and the teethe, and they go chewing it all the time that they do travel. and that which they do chew, they do swallow it down, and in this sort they do journey, three or four days, without having need of meat, or drink, for they feel no hunger, dryness, nor weakness, nor travel does trouble them. I do think that to journey after this sort, is the cause they go chewing continually the little balls: they do bring phlegm into the mouth, and do return to swallow them into the stomach, the which does retain the natural heat, which does go consuming, and maintaining them selves of them, the which we do see happen in many beasts, for that much time of the Winter, they be shut up into their Caves, and hollow places of the earth, and do pass there without any meat. And for that they have to consume the natural heat, of the fatness, which they had gotten in the Summer, the Bear being a great and fierce beast,  much time of the Winter is in his Cave, and does live without meat, or drink, with only chewing his paws, the which perhaps he does for the stated cause: this is the substance which I have gathered of this Herb, so celebrated and called Tobacco, for that surely it is an Herb of great estimation, for the great virtues that it has, as we have stated.</p>

He established 2 companies made up of merchant-adventurers eager to plumb the tantalizing riches of North America--these were the London Company and the Plymouth Company.</p><p>The first to send ships was the London Company, which sent forth three in December of 1606. James gave them three objectives: find gold, find a route to the South Seas, and find the Lost Colony of Roanoke.</p><p>Adverse winds held their ship near England for 6 weeks, and seriously depleted their food reserves. Forty-five died on the voyage, but 101 men and 4 boys finally landed on a <a href="#Physical"><IMG SRC="JamesT_Landing_Sign.GIF" WIDTH=50 Height=40>semi-island</a> in May, 1607. A record log tells us that within a month they were able to compete the building of a large triangular fort on the banks of a river the Indians knew as "Powhatan's River," or "Powhatan's Flu." The settlers named it the James, after their King.</p><p>At first the climate seemed mild, the Indians friendly. As John Smith wrote, "heaven and earth never agreed better to frame a place for man's habitations."</p><p>Then came blistering heat, swarms of insects spawned in the nearby wetlands, typhus, unfit water supplies, starvation, fierce winters, Indian attacks, shiploads of inappropriately-prepared "Colonists" sent from a changing England that had no other place for them, and even a period of tyrannical martial law when missing church 3 times was a capital offense.</p><p>The troubles were exacerbated by the colonists themselves. Many of them we could call gentlemen-adventurers, "whose breeding," a contemporary said, "never knew what a day's labour meant." These were men, often lesser scions of nobility, with no future in overpopulated England, who were lured by the Virginia Company with promises of land and wealth--much as people were lured to California during the Gold Rush. But there was no gold in Virginia, and these "prospectors" didn't know how to farm, didn't know how to hunt, and--possibly feeling betrayed by the Virginia Company's promises, and lacking any land of their own--were not known for their spirit of cooperation either among themselves, nor with the local Indians of the Powhatan confederacy.</p><p>In 1609, a fleet of 9 ships from England had been caught in a tremendous <a href="#gale">hurricane</a>, and the lead ship, the Sea Venture, had been wreched off Bermuda, its passengers--including many of the proposed new leaders of the colony--stranded for months. The rest of the ships had limped into Jamestown in August of 1609, their passengers mostly sick or hurt--one ship was said to carry the plague--and provided nothing but extra mouths to feed--400, in fact.</p><p>Apparently the only man who had been able to keep a modicum of peace, both in the colony and with the Indians, was John Smith. Even so, by 1609, the settlers had suffered one horror after another. Hundreds had died, but the worst was yet to come. Smith, injured in a <a href="#pipe-smoker">gunpowder explosion</a>, was shipped back to England, and with other leaders stranded on Bermuda, the colony of as many as 600 fell into chaos.</p><p>Then another river-freezing, icicled winter hit, and with it a period so bad it was later called the Starving Time.  Arms and valuable worktools were traded for a pittance in food. The fields lay fallow. Housing was used as firewood. The weak settlers were easy pickings for the contemptuous Indians. Trapped within their walls by Powhatan's renewed enmity, the Jamestown residents ate their way through their livestock, their pets, mice, rats--and each other. Many turned to cannibalism, sneaking out at night--braving Indian ambush--to dig up the graves of both English and Indian dead. One contemporary wrote, in a joke that has spanned centuries, of a man who secretly killed his wife and ate her, until only the head was left. The author appended to the story, "Now, whether she was better roasted, boiled or carbonadoed (grilled), I know not, but of such a dish as powdered (salted) wife I never heard of."</p><p>While in the relative paradise of Bermuda, the hurricane survivors--including one passenger named John Rolfe, who had learned to smoke tobacco in London--built two ships from the wreckage of the Sea Venture, and finally resumed their journey.On May 24, 1610, approaching Jamestown, they came upon only 60 gaunt survivors of the "Starving Time"--nearly 90% of the colony had died during the winter.</p><p>The ships from Bermuda brought only more mouths, and few reserves of food. There were no crops, no tools, no housing, no hope. It was the end. Survivors and rescuers packed what they could on the ships, and headed down the river. Jamestown was abandoned..</p><p>But the ships were not 10 miles down the James when they were met with a boat whose occupants told them Lord De La Warr, newly appointed Governor of Virginia, was on his way with three ships filled with supplies and 150 new colonists. They were ordered to return to await the Governor.</p><p>Jamestown had been given a dramatic reprieve. Yet life remained onerous, and Jamestown had yet to find a crop, or a mineral, or an industry that would make the colony economically viable. The Virginia Company continued to pour people and resources into a venture with virtually no return of investment.</p><p>It was in 1612 that John Rolfe began growing tobacco. But Rolfe shunned the harsh product grown by the local Indians, <i>Nicotiana Rustica.</i> It would never sell in London. Somehow he obtained seeds from the coveted <i>Nicotiana Tabacum</i> strain then being grown in Trinidad and South America--though Spain had declared a penalty of death to anyone selling such seeds to a non-Spaniard.</p><p>Then Pocahontas entered Rolfe's life. Bad relations with the Indians had continued to plague the settlers. Once, when the Indians held several English captive, the colonists captured and held hostage the chief's beloved young daughter, Pocahontas. John Smith's later writings tell us that a few years earlier at the age of 12, Pocahontas had dramatically saved Smith from her father, the Powhatan's, wrath. The incident could more likely have been a ceremonial "saving," or nonexistent, but it is verifiably established that in the early days she did indeed help the colony--with food or with warnings of attack.</p><p>But it was four years later now, and Pocahontas was far from the naked child who with her friends used to turn cartwheels through the streets of a hopeful Jamestown. Now she was a young woman, and being held by the English. It was during this period, and in his Virginia tobacco fields that Rolfe began to woo--and win--Pocahantas. How much did Pocahontas know about tobacco? It is true that Powhatan women grew the food, while in a completely separate sector, a sort of back area of the village, the men grew the tobacco. Pocahontas, however, had a seemingly insatiable curiosity, and tended to roam where she wanted. (Her birth name was Matoaka; we know her by Pocahontas, a sort of Indian nickname which meant "Frisky," "Mischievous" or "Playful One"). It is likely she either knew a great deal about tobacco cultivation, or knew how to find answers if they were needed. The dramatic success of Jamestown's tobacco crop is credited not only to Rolfe's importation of the Spanish strain, but to his finding better ways of growing and curing it. We may only conjecture how much he was guided in cultivation and curing techniques by Pocahontas.</p><p>During captivity, Pocahontas received daily bible lessons, and eventually converted to Christianity, changing her name to "Rebecca."  <a href="#castigated">Rolfe married her</a> in April of 1614, with Powhatan's approval. This act is credited with bringing <a href="#Powhatan"> 8 years of peace</a> with the Indians, a period when the energies of the colonists could be devoted to the growing of its new cash crop--which indeed was soon to become the New World's currency.</p><p>For in 1614, in what has been called by at least one historian the most momentous event of the 17th century, the first shipment of Virginia tobacco was sold in London.</p><p>Two years later, in June, 1616, Rolfe and other leaders of the colony arrived in London. Rolfe brought <a href="#never returned">Rebecca</a> with him, where her exotic looks and regal bearing made her a popular rage, and she was presented to the court of Queen Anne as a princess. At the same time, the spectacle of a "savage" princess married to a tobacco farmer may have given rise to exceptionally cutting Elizabethan barbs.</p><p>But Rolfe's trip was very much about the colony's major export--tobacco. Despite <a href="#James I">James I's</a> disapproval of the colony's dependence on a crop he despised, the very survival of his namesake colony could be at stake. And, of course, James could not ignore the enormous import duties Rolfe's Virginia tobacco, <a href="#Orinoco">"Orinoco"</a>, brought to the royal treasury--Londoners and others around the world liked its taste and began demanding it. Since all sales had to be made through London, the English treasury grew with every transaction. Rolfe's trip was a success..</p><p>Tobacco became the rage, tobacco and nothing else. We have reports of it being grown in the very streets of Jamestown. Laws were passed forcing farmers to devote a percentage of their efforts to growing food.</p><P>By 1619 Jamestown  had exported 10 tons of tobacco to Europe and was a boomtown. The export business was going so well the colonists were able to afford two imports which would greatly contribute to their productivity and quality of life. 20 Blacks from Africa and 90 women from England. The <a href="#aaBlacks">Africans</a> were paid for in food; each woman cost 120 pounds of tobacco.</p><p>By 1639 Jamestown  had exported 750 tons of tobacco. Tobacco was the American colonies' chief export. The Jamestown colonists had not found gold, nor a route to the South Seas, nor the Lost Colony on Roanoke Island. What they had found was tobacco. Tobacco had brought the settlement from wretched failure to giddying success. Tobacco had fed the need for labor and--since it wore out the soil every 4-7 years--the mad rush for land all through the waterways of the Chesapeake Bay--or as the entire area soon became known, "Tobacco Coast."</p><p>Tobacco can well be credited with establishing Jamestown as the first permanent English colony in the New World.</p>	<hr><p>ADDENDA:</p>	<hr><p><h4><a name=aa3>Economics:and politics</a></h4></p><p>It's often forgotten that the first two successful settlements in America were commercial ventures, licensed by the King. A part of the problem in the early days of Jamestown was its population of men seduced with a promise of riches by the ever-recruiting companies.</p><p>England is credited for recognizing this, and for implementing what was then a radical idea for successful colonizations--a permanent settlement had to have women. Thus the English were successful in creating a permanent presence in the New World, unlike the more adventuring French and Spanish.</p><p>The London company (Jamestown) never made any money and was dissolved in the 1620s.</p><p>The prohibition against direct sales of tobacco to other countries (all such sales had to be made through London, where hefty excise taxes were levied) was one of the main aggravations leading to the American Revolution.</p>	<hr><p><h4><a name=aa4>The People</a></h4></p><p>"Rebecca" <a name="aagravesend"><a name="never returned">never returned to America. She had barely begun the voyage back when her illness became so severe that the ship had to stop in Gravesend. It was there she died--some say of influenza, some of pneumonia, some of smallpox--in 1617 at the age of 22. She was interred somewhere in the nave of St. George's Church, which burned down in 1727, and was rebuilt in 1731.</p><p>John Rolfe returned to Virginia in 1617, and married Joane, the daughter of William Pierce, who had come to Jamestown in 1609. Rolfe made out his will in 1622, confessing to being "sick and weak in body." His name does not appear on the list of the dead, but since his farm at Bermuda Hundred was destroyed, most believe Rolfe died in the Indian Massacre of 1622 at the age of 37.</p><p>The Rolfes' son, Thomas, was also sickly, and was left to be raised in England. John Rolfe never saw his son again. In 1635, at the age of 20, Thomas returned to Virginia to reclaim his birthrights--both English ("Varina," the plantation--named for a variety of tobacco--on which he was born) and Indian, as his grandfather Powhatan had left him thousands of acres all around Jamestown. Thomas married an Englishwoman, Jane Poythress, and began a family. Many Virginians (the Blairs, Bollings, Lewises, Randolphs)--and many British--today are understandably proud to trace their lineage back to the remarkable, storybook union of the Indian princess Pocahontas and John Rolfe.</p><p><a name="Powhatan"><a name="aaPowhatan">Shortly after Rolfe notified Powhatan of his daughter's death, Powhatan resigned his leadership, entrusting it to his brother Opitchapan, and moved to a site as far as possible from the English settlements. Just a year later, in 1618, he died. Opitchapan's successor, the warlike Opechancanough, instigated the Indian Massacre of 1622.  Powhatan's confederacy, decimated by disease and a futile war against a never-ending wave of immigrants, was completely subjugated by 1644. In 1651 the country's first Indian Reservation was established in Virginia--for the remnants of Pocahontas' people.</p>	<hr><p><h4><a name=aa5><a name=Physical>The Physical Site</a></h4></p><p>Jamestown was picked for its military advantages. It had a deep-water mooring for the ships, it was far enough up the James to be out of sight of the fearsome Spanish, and it was a semi-island--protected on three sides by the river and marshes.</p><p>But it was a swamp, and a phenomenally unhealthy location. Fresh water was a major problem, and often the colonists were reduced to drinking the brackish river water. Malaria and dysentery periodically raged through the community. It suffered disastrous fires and explosions in the early days, and even as a city it was burned down twice. Bacon burned it during his Rebellion, and a few years later it burned down again by accident. When the fourth State House burned in 1698, the site was abandoned, and the capitol moved to Williamsburg. Jamestown, out of the mainstream of the bustling colony now, gradually fell into ruins.</p>	<hr><p><h4><a name=aa6>The Present</a></h4></p><p>Preparations are now underway for a grand festival in 2007 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. Archeological efforts are attempting to establish more accurately the original location of the triangular wooden fort completed on June 15, 1607. A 19th Century paddlewheel boat churned up the earth under the original site, and it caved in early in the 20th century. It was thought the original site of the fort was now out in the James, but there is speculation that churches would never move from hallowed ground, and that the site of the ruins of the brick church may well be situated at a corner of the fort still on land.Many artifacts were lost when the site was a ferry landing, and travelers simply picked them up for souvenirs.</p>Jamestown, 1995<center><BR><A HREF ="JamesT_Landing.GIF"><IMG border=0 SRC="JamesT_Landing_Sign.GIF"><P>The Landing Site</P></A><P><BR><A HREF ="Pitch_and_tar_Swamp.gif"><IMG border=0 SRC="Pitch_and_tar_Sign.GIF">PItch-and-Tar Swamp</A><P><P><BR><A HREF ="Kids_at_Jamestown.gif"><IMG border=0 SRC="Kids_at_JT_Cut.GIF"><P>Kids Learning about Tobacco</P></A><P><P><BR><A HREF ="JSmith_Statue.gif"><IMG border=1 SRC="JSmith_Statue_Cut.GIF">Statue of John Smith Overlooking the James</A><P><P><BR><A HREF ="Jamestown_Tour_Sign.gif"><IMG border=1 SRC="Jamestown_Tour_Sign_Cut.GIF"><P>A Sign on the Road Tour of Jamestown Island</P></A><P><center><P><LI> The Isthmus, Site of the Great Road<LI> An Indian Village<LI> The Susan Constant</center></center>	<hr><p><h4><a name=aa7>FOOTNOTES</a></h4></p><a name="pipe-smoker"><p>At least one reference lays the blame for the explosion that sent John Smith back to England to a careless pipe-smoker.	<hr><p>The story of the <a name="gale">gale and the survival of the ships' passengers on a tropical island much caught the fancy of Londoners; it is thought that Shakespeare based his last play, "The Tempest" (1619) on this very event.</p>	<hr><p><a name="James I">James I of England wrote what many consider the first anti-smoking tract, "De abusu tobacci" ("A Counterblaste to Tobacco,") in 1603.</p>	<hr><p>Rolfe was <a name="castigated">castigated by James for marrying Pocahontas without consulting him first. James was upset not because Rolfe had married someone outside his race, but because he, a mere commoner, had married very much outside his class. In a travesty of a ceremony a few years earlier, James had actually had a reluctant Powhatan crowned "King of Virginia." Therefore Pocahontas was indeed a true Princess. James was outraged that should Powhatan die, Rolfe could conceivably succeed him as King, and thus suddenly become an equal in the brotherhood of royalty.</p>	<hr><p>Pocahontas also met John Smith once again in London, but as she was royalty and he but a commoner, Pocahontas reportedly had a difficult time rekindling their old relationship.<P> <a name="aaivor">According to Ivor Hume in The Virginia Adventure,<i> "John Smith died at the age of fifty-one in London in 1631, leaving as his legacy his books, his maps, and his controversial personality, which together will keep his memory flamboyantly alive as long as there is a a Virginia."</i></p>	<hr><p>Rolfe named his brand of tobacco <a name="Orinoco">"Orinoco" undoubtedly to evoke the mystery and exotic adventure of tobacco-popularizer Sir Walter Raleigh's expeditions up the Orinoco river in Guiana in search of the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado.</p>	<hr><p>Raleigh was on difficult terms with James; a favorite of Elizabeth I, he had tried 3 times in the 1580s to establish a permanent English settlement in Virginia (the last had been the especially ill-fated "Lost Colony" on Roanoke Island), and had named the state itself for the Virgin Queen.</p>	<hr><p>James held Raleigh prisoner in the Tower of London for 13 years (where he grew his own tobacco). Raleigh must have followed the Jamestown developments avidly from his cell, and even wrote a letter to Queen Anne in 1610, begging to be allowed to lend his services in person to the colony. But he was never again to land in the Virginia that once was his--though in 1618, he sailed close by its coast, after a brief but disastrous mission back to the Orinoco. Later that year, in England, Raleigh was beheaded for treason. It is said that even to the very end he kept his pipe.</p>	<hr><p><a name="aaBlacks">The Blacks were bought as indentured servants from a passing Dutch ship low on food, and the women were supplied by a private English company.

--18-year-old smoker, "Young, Carefree and in Love With Cigarettes," The New York Times,  July 30, 1995

<p><i>When all the garbage is stripped away, successful cigarette advertising involves showing the kind of people most people would like to be, doing the things most people would like to do, and smoking up a storm. I don't know any way of doing this that doesn't tempt young people to smoke.</i></p>

-- advertising executive who worked on the Marlboro account, quoted in the 1994 Surgeon General's Report. Consumer Reports, March, 1995

<HR>
I. The Promoters

<p>Consider the never-ending flow of cigarette advertising and promotions, and their association with non-tobacco entities like sports figures, movie stars, corporations, grocery stores, the local pharmacy, doctor's office or even one's own living room. By their very ubiquity, coupled with their acceptance by the rest of society--including highly admired individuals and corporations--this flood of promotions serves to give silent rebuttal to the truth about tobacco.</p>


<hr>
<p><i>"The tobacco industry buys silence from these groups . . . Even if that's not made explicit, that's what happens. It's had a tremendous impact because these are the very groups that most need to speak out, and they won't." </i>-- Jean Kilbourne, Wellesley College, speaking of tobacco industry donations to black and women's organizations.

<p><i>"They are peddling an addictive and lethal drug, and their ability to market their product depends on their ability to say they are a legitimate member of American society."</i> --Michael Pertschuk, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, current codirector of the Advocacy Institute in Washington: 

<p><i>"Thank God for sinners. They're the only people to support the arts." </i>--anonymous dance company spokeswoman

<p><i>"Like the reaction of so many to the relationship between culture and cigarettes, the comment [above] had at its core the argument that the end justifies the means. Only it doesn't." </i>--Anna Quindlen

<hr>
II. The Pointedly Silent Legitimizers

<p>Philanthropic contributions to arts, charity and cultural organizations are effective in buying legitimacy and silence. Institutions that have accepted tobacco industry philanthropy may or may not believe there is no quid-pro-quo, but in a crunch, many have been urged to speak up for tobacco industry goals to political bodies. In 1994 in New York City, Philip Morris notes to its donees stated that if a smokefree bill passed, PM contributions might dry up. The note urged institutions--some shocked, some more than willing to comply--to speak with their legislators.
<p>
By the mere fact of accepting tobacco industry donations, an organization lends a little of its legitimacy and status to tobacco companies, allowing the companies to shift the focus away from their commonly-perceived roles as merchants of death. Such an organization cannot be unaware it risks losing those donations if its members speak out about the 400,000 dead a year from tobacco-related diseases.

<p>"If they kill off cigarette and alcohol advertising," he says, "black papers may as well stop printing." -- Keith Lockart, president of Lockart & Pettus, Inc., an African-American advertising agency.
<p>"Groups representing those communities would be speaking out in opposition to aggressive marketing of the tobacco industry .... But what you see are groups like National Urban League and NAACP, who need the money and take the money from RJR and Philip Morris, saying not word one about this problem l,hat afflicts their community. Groups in the gay community are by and large silent on this same concern. You could infer that tobacco company contributions, while helpful on the one hand, are buying silence on the other."-- Cliff Douglas of the Advocacy Institute
<p>It is in this vein then, that the Tobacco BBS sets out to create a database of enablers -- those who by lending their good name, help establish the ubiquity and seemingly everyday innocuousness of smoking, help foster the legitimacy of tobacco companies, and help collaborate in the lie that cigarettes couldn't possibly be "*that* bad for you."</p>

<p>The FDA rule goes on to say:</p>

<p>The final regulation requires that specific youth and adult readership data be available for any magazine that displays a tobacco advertisement with color or imagery. Simmons currently conducts interviews with adults in approximately 20,000 households annually and subsequently returns to about 3,000 of these households to interview their youth members. In general, however, marketing research firms collect data on youth readership only for those magazines commonly read by this age group. Thus, although 78 percent and 48 percent of the magazines in the two youth readership samples described above exceeded the regulatory readership threshold, these sample results likely overestimate the percentage of magazines with current tobacco ads that exceed the threshold.</p>

<p>Simmons now collects adult readership data for about 230 magazines and youth readership for about 65 magazines. Because tobacco manufacturers currently advertise in about 100 magazines, the industry could often add magazines that are currently part of an ongoing adult readership survey to a youth survey, saving approximately 60 percent of the cost of collecting both adult and youth data. </p>

<br> From a Press Release dated Feb. 29, 1996: <i> the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami would not happen nearly at the scale -- particularly the national scale -- it does now without the involvement of major corporate sponsors. The main sponsors of the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami include Philip Morris USA's brand Marlboro, PPG Industries and Toyota. 

<p>"The up-front financial support of corporate sponsorship has helped make the PPG Indy Car World Series one of the fastest-growing event series in the United States . . It allows event promoters to compete in major markets throughout the United States . . . As a result, sponsorship has enabled the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami to grow . . .

<p>"That's why this study increases my concern about efforts to limit or ban tobacco-brand sponsorship of sports and entertainment events, such as the regulations recently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). . . . "</i>

<p><STRONG>But Bowman, 67, still won't open his store on a Sunday and he still won't sell liquor or tobacco. It is not a moral issue, he said. He just doesn't believe selling things that could cause kids harm is a good message to those young people.  </STRONG> 
<p>
Some neighbors thought Bowman was crazy when he decided to take those items off the shelves, that he would regret it in the pocketbook. 
<p>

<p><h2><a name=aa1>DISCLAIMER</a></h2>
</p>

<p> I had no recorder, so please bear in mind the quirks of memory and hearing, and the perils of rapid writing. I've tried to make the following account as accurate as possible. Corrections/clarifications/comments are welcome.</p>

	<hr>

<p><h2><a name=aa2>THE BILL</a></h2>
</p>

<p>New York, NY. Sept. 26, 1994. The second hearing on Int. No. 232A, commonly known as the Smokefree Air act, was held today. Int. No. 232A is not really a new bill, but an amendment to the New York City Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988, which prohibited smoking in most common areas of workplaces, and required restaurants to set up nonsmoking sections of at least 50% of total capacity; restaurants seating less than 50 people were exempted. The new amendment would ban smoking completely in all restaurants and tighten workplace restrictions.</p>

<p>The prime sponsors of Int. No. 232A are the Speaker (Council Member Vallone), Health Committee Chairman Enoch Williams, Environmental Protection Committee Chairman Stanley Michels and Councilwoman Juanita Watkins </p>

<p>Cosponsors are Council Members Malave-Dilan, Freed, Albanese, Duane, Fisher, Henry, Linares, McCabe, Powell IV, the Public Advocate (Mark Green), Rivera, Robles, Warden, White, Cruz and Fusco; also Council Members Clarke, DeMarco, DiBrienza, Eldridge, Fields, Foster, Harrison, Lasher, Leffler, Povman, Robinson and Wooten.</p>

<p>The first meeting had been held in June, where an overwhelming number of people supported the bill, by a ratio of about 7 to 1. Since June, the bill had gotten even tougher--the exemption for restaurants seating less than 50 was removed. The removal was undoubtedly in response to the many people and restaurateurs who had  claimed either that it was an unfair competitive advantage, or that such restaurants are the worst-equipped to sequester smoke. </p>

	<hr>

<p><h2><a name=aa3>THE PRELIMINARIES</a></h2>
</p>

<p>The hearing was to begin at 10; those wishing to speak were to sign up at 9. When I arrived at 9:30, there was already a line outside and down the steps of City Hall.</p>

<p>The day was overcast and muggy. As soon as I joined the line, the Tobacco Institute contingent arrived, filing in directly behind me. No one smoked.</p>

<p>One of the TI women mentioned with approval the number of "Accommodation Program" buttons she saw--an industry-promoted green & white button with a yin-yang symbol which businesses are encouraged to display to welcome both smokers and nonsmokers.</p>

<p>In response to the woman's observation, the man ahead of me seemed disturbed, and made an incoherent, seemingly hostile comment, which was politely ignored. As we waited in line he struck up a conversation of sorts with me, but it was difficult to communicate with him, or to decipher his point of view. Inside, he sat with the contingent from FAMI (Family & Friends of the Mentally Ill), which argues for smoking rights for the mentally ill in hospitals.</p>

<p>Once inside, I ran my backpack through the X-Ray, and walked upstairs to the large hearing room, whose main floor and balcony were already 80% full.</p>

<p>Smoking is not allowed in the hearing room, but it was ventilated to the outside just the same (the windows were open).</p>

<p>The man next to me was going over laser print-outs of Kent sales figures; he asked the man in front of me if he had an extra "Accommodation Program" button. He did.</p>

<p>The press was out in force this time, a full bank of cameras set up along the right-hand side, and more in the balcony. If anyone took a break from the general feeling of tension and import, it was to wonder: what's going on with the young woman in the audience wearing a <i>rhinestone tiara??</i></p>

<p>The Sergeant-at-Arms, a large, portly man of about 60, continued to glance over the room impassively, chewing gum with his mouth closed.</p>

<p>The following City Council members were among those present at the start of the meeting (though many would leave, and others would enter in a constant reshuffling throughout the day):</p>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>Peter Vallone</li>
<li>Enoch Williams</li>
<li>Julia Harrison</li>
<li>Morton Povman (Q)</li>
<li>Andy Aristotle (M)</li>
<li>Stanley E. Michels</li>
<li>Priscilla Wooten (Br)</li>
<li>Jose Rivera</li>
<li>Una Clarke (Br)</li>
<li>Ognibene</li>
<li>Victor Robles (Br)</li>
<li>Tom Oppen (Q)</li>
<li>Shirley Adams</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><h2><a name=aa4>THE HEARING</a></h2>
</p>

<p>At 10:10 AM, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, sponsor of the bill, spoke.</p>
<p>Vallone said the bill's aim was to protect nonsmokers; he referred to the health hazards of second-hand smoke, citing the conclusions of the EPA and 5 surgeons general. He said he was aware of--and the city council took seriously--businesspeople's concern about economic factors; but, he said, the facts were clear, and the health of New Yorkers must be "our priority." This is "not a civil liberties issue," he said, "this is a _health_ issue" that affects all of us.</p>

<p>City Council Chair Enoch Williams then spoke briefly, echoing Vallone's sentiments.</p>

	<hr>

<p><h2><a name=aa5>THE TESTIMONY</a></h2>
</h2>
</p>

<p>Note that two recent events were very much on the minds of both the council and the speakers, and were to figure in the testimony.</p>

<p>One was the remarkable series of full page ads and radio spots by an organization called United Restaurant Hotel Tavern Association. The ads lambasted the City Council for attempting to ban restaurant smoking in "our town."</p>

<p>The other was an article in the NY Times that morning which reported a threat by Philip Morris that "if the bill is passed, it would cause us to reconsider having our headquarters in New York City." (Philip Morris later said the statement was not a threat, but the expression of "an option" the company would consider if the bill were passed.)</p>

<p>Now it was the public's turn to respond. This was their day, and a rough total of 96 people or groups spoke during a hearing that went nonstop from 10:15 AM to 6:20 PM. Each person had exactly 3 minutes to speak, though the chair was lenient about overtime. Groups were allowed 10 minutes, and could divide their time any way they saw fit.</p>

<h3><a name=aa6><p>The final tally:</p>
<p>Those in favor of the bill as presented: 62</p>
<p>Those opposed to the bill as presented:  34</p>

</a></h3>

	<hr>

<P><a name=aa7><h3><a name=aa7>1. 

<li>MICHAEL O'NEAL, restaurateur--YEA</li> 
<li>HAROLD FREEDMAN, NYS Commissioner for Health--YEA</li> 
<li>JANET SACKMAN, former Lucky Strike/Chesterfield model, American Cancer Society--YEA</a></h3></li></a>

<p>In the early 60s, Michael O'Neal and his brother, actor Patrick O'Neal, opened The Ginger Man, one of the first restaurants to serve the crowds from the newly-created Lincoln Center; the Ginger Man and subsequent restaurants--O'Neal's Baloon, the Landmark Tavern, O'Neal's Brothers, O'Neal's 57th St.--have been popular gathering places for New Yorkers for many years.</p>

<p>O'Neal bitterly fought the 1988 law which first set aside 50% of a restaurant's seating for nonsmokers. At this year's previous meeting in June, he testified that he had changed his mind--two of his family members had come down with cancer--and was in favor of a complete ban. Also, he was tired of the fights among patrons due to the complex logistics of finding agreeable smoking and non-smoking seating patterns.</p>

<p>Today O'Neal testified that he had been in the restaurant business for 30 years, and has been past president of the New York City and New York State Restaurant Associations. He said that before this latest ad blitz, he had never heard of the United Restaurant Hotel and Tavern Association. He said their ads were undoubtedly paid for by the cigarette industry.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Neal referred to the Philip Morris threat to leave the city, and asked, Where are they going to go? People are going nonsmoking all over the country. In addition, Philip Morris employees have a non-smoking environment--"why not my employees?" he asked. "That's the issue."</p>

<p>In closing, O'Neal, he said his brother Patrick, a heavy smoker, died last month of lung cancer. His birthday was September 26--he would have been 67 years old today.</p>

<p>JANET SACKMAN was a model for Chesterfield and Lucky Strike Cigarettes. At 62, she is a strikingly pretty and poised woman.</p>

<p>She said she began smoking in 1949 because an ad agency rep had suggested she'd look more authentic. In 1983 she had a laryngectomy and in 1990 suffered a bout with lung cancer. She now teaches other laryngectomy patients to speak.</p>

<p>As she talked, one had to strain slightly to catch her words as they were spoken through a kind of burping action; yet they were measured and strong. The Sergeant.-at-Arms stopped scanning the room as he watched her testify. It was the only time I saw him pay such singular, doleful attention to any one speaker.</p>

	<hr>

<a name=aa8><h3><a name=aa8>2. <ol>

<li>BRENNAN DAWSON, Tobacco Institute--NAY</li> 
<li>DAVID REEMS, Covington & Burling--NAY</a></h3></li> </a>

</ol>
</p>
<p>Ms. DAWSON, one of the chief spokespeople for the Tobacco Institute, called the new law "unreasonable, unworkable, and unfair." Her statement elicited from the crowd a round of both applause and boos.</p>

<p>She said that the non-partisan Congressional Research Service had found fault with the EPA report, and that the City Council should let the employers decide on smoking policy.</p>

<p>COVINGTON & BURLING is the law firm of the Tobacco Institute in Washington. Mr. REEMS said the law was a "solution in search of a problem that will create problems."</p>

<p>He said the effort was doomed to failure because the Council did not have jurisdiction. He referred to the VDT scare of a few years ago, and said the state in that instance had been preempted by federal mandates from creating new labor safety laws.</p>

<p>Smiling, Council Chair Williams informed Reems that "our legal counsel has checked that out."</p>

<p>Councilmember Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn) then addressed the tobacco representatives. He mentioned the morning's N.Y. Times article, and said the bill before the council was a difficult decision. "I don't know if that's the way you lobby in the tobacco country of North Carolina, but New Yorkers don't like to be threatened," he said to thunderous applause.</p>

<p>Weiner said that he has been listening intently to arguments from both sides. But, he said, "What does not add to debate is a company standing up at a press conference or releasing a press release saying that, 'If we don't get our way we're going to take our ball and go home. My view is, go home now." Weiner said to more applause,  "PM has done nothing but take someone who was leaning against the bill to leaning for the bill."</p>

<p>Ms. Dawson apologized for PM's seeming threat, and characterized it as an unfortunate expression of the company's frustration.</p>

<p>Mr. Reems asked that the council should "consider overall business concerns" of restaurateurs and employers.</p>

<p>Councilmember Albanese replied to Reems that he had a share in a restaurant that went nonsmoking, and "we've increased our business."</p>

<li>LISA SMITH, researcher for Health Policy at University of California at San Francisco--YEA</li>
<li>RON DAVIS, MI Dept. of Health--YEA</li>
<li>LEN CYRIL (?), for BARRY FOGEL, ex-president, Beverly Hills Restaurant Association--YEA</li></a></h3></a>

<p>PATRICK REYNOLDS, grandson of RJ Reynolds founder Richard Joshua Reynolds, talked about those in the Reynolds family who had died of tobacco-related diseases--his father, his half-brother, his aunt and mother, and RJ Reynolds himself. "They smoked the family brands," he said.</p>

<p>In regards to Philip Morris' threat to move their headquarters should the bill pass, Reynolds said New Yorkers should then feel "pride that a few more drug pushers have left town."</p>

<p>LISA SMITH cited a study of restaurant income that showed no significant business had been lost--and in some cases business was increased--in 15 cities that have gone smokefree across the country.</p>

<p>She cited an ad placed by pro-smoking groups that ran, "What if they passed a law that took away 30% of your business." The ad refers only to unsubstantiated opinions obtained in some surveys of restaurant managers, and estimations of a 30% loss "is a sham," she said.</p>

<p>RON DAVIS became head of the Federal Office of Smoking & Health in 1987. He cited the 1986 Surgeon General's report which found ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) a health hazard, with children at special risk.</p>

<p>He said the separation of smokers and nonsmokers may reduce, but will not eliminate ETS.</p>

<p>He said the problem was exacerbated by great numbers of smokers who do not follow tobacco industry guidelines on public smoking. "Half of smokers are not showing 'common courtesy' as the tobacco industry defines it," he said.</p>

<p>LEN CYRIL read BARRY FOGEL's letter to the council.</p>

<p>Fogel wrote that he had been president in 1988 of the Beverly Hills Restaurant Association, which successfully fought a local smokefree bill, </p>

<p>He said the BHRA had been organized and financed almost exclusively by the tobacco industry.</p>

<p>Fogel said he regretted his participation in the group. He owns the Jacocco restaurants, and wrote that since they went nonsmoking, "sales have risen."</p>

<p><h3><a name=aa10><h3>4. WILLIAM ALTHAUS, National Smokers Alliance--NAY</p>
</a></h3>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Althaus is Chairman of the National Board of Advisors for the Alexandria, VA-based NSA.</p>

<p>He was mayor of York, PA for 3 terms. In 1989, he signed an order that restricted smoking in city buildings, an action he now disavows. He is a past President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</p>

<p>Mr. Althaus said the bill was a "classic case of diverting resources of city government to an area that is working quite well."</p>

<p>He said the public is "reasonably free from (large) amounts of smoke," and expressed distaste for the instituting of a "smoke police." He said people should be able to make their own decisions about which kind of restaurant to frequent.</p>

<p>Nonsmokers "are being taken care of;" it's time, he said, to "give smokers a little concern."</p>

<p>Councilmember Albanese asked how long his organization had been in existence. Althaus said the NSA had been established a year ago, and was supported by 15 tobacco companies.</p>

<p>Albanese then asked who the founding members of the NSA are.</p>

<p>Althaus replied, "I don't know who they are, but the issue is--"</p>

<p>"The issue," interrupted Albanese, "is the health of the citizens of this city and this country."</p>

<p>Councilmember Linares said that "the argument put forward by the tobacco industry is a smokescreen."</p>

<p>In regards to people making their own decision about which restaurant to frequent, Councilmember Clarke said that children don't make those decisions.</p>

<p>Councilmember Thomas Ognibene stated that though he himself was a nonsmoker, he felt the bill contained "draconian" measures. If people don't like smoke, he said, "people can stay home". He said the bill risked putting a major business segment out of business.</p>

<p>Mr. Althaus referred to the loss of jobs among the poor resulting from business losses in the restaurant and hotel sector--the largest employers of people of color. "Those are the ones who'll lose their jobs," he said.</p>

<p>Councilmember Juanita Watkins quickly interrupted Althaus, retorting that "We used to have to pick tobacco too."</p>

<p>Albanese asked Althaus if he believed smoking causes lung cancer.</p>

<p>It's a "risk factor," he replied.</p>

<p>NOTE: Mr. Althaus has previously stated that the NSA was the "brainchild" of Philip Morris and its public relations firm, Burson-Marsteller. Philip Morris, he has said, provided most of the start-up money, along with the names of smokers..</p>

<li>JOSEPH SPINNATO, president, Hotel Association of New York City; associated with the Sheraton New York Hotel--NAY</li> 
<li>PAUL LIOTTA, Sheraton Hotels</li> 
<li>MR. EASTMAN(?), General Manager of the Marriott Marquee and 2 other hotels.</a></h3>
</li> </a>
</ul>

<p>Mr. SPINNATO said that in the past he has independently supported efforts to limit smoking, but most of the NY hotel industry's smoking rooms are required by foreign guests, who also tend to dine at their hotels for security reasons.</p>

<p>"About 35 percent of all business travelers and visitors who stay at our hotels are international visitors who are determined smokers. As a result, this proposed legislation will unfairly impact on many of our hotels that specifically cater to these travelers."</p>

<p>Mr. Spinnato had several suggestions for an amended bill, along with steps by which many of the problems caused by ETS could be alleviated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rather than a complete ban, the bill should increase smokefree sections to 75%</li> 
<li>It should also increase fines.</li> 
<li>Restaurants should design seating so that non-smokers don't have to walk through the smoking section, and so that the smoking section is closer to vents.</li> 
<li>Restaurants should consider a redesign of air systems</li> 
</ul>

<p>PAUL LIOTTA of the Sheraton Hotels cited a study that found 50% of Los Angeles restaurants in a smoke-free area reported loss of business.</p>

<p>MR. EASTMAN of the Marriott Marquee also urged the adoption of a 75/25 plan, where 25% of restaurant space would go to smokers.</p>

<p>Councilmember Anthony Aristotle questioned Mr. Liotta's study, and cited the California Hotel & Motel Association's support for a strong statewide smoking ban.</p>

<p>Mr. Spinnato in reply said the Greater Los Angeles Business Council reported significant loss of business in the now-smokefree Greater Los Angeles area, and traced customers taking their business instead to restaurants in municipalities that allowed smoking.</p>

<p>There ensued some confusion about exactly what area of the city is encompassed by the term "Greater Los Angeles." No one seemed to know.</p>

<p>Councilmember Albanese said that he would appreciate seeing the survey in question, and the group said they would make it available to the City Council.</p>

<p>Councilmember Lucy Cruz then spoke, saying that she was a smoker, and "I'm not happy about it."</p>

<p>In the matter of "smokers' rights vs. nonsmokers' rights," she said it was her right to ruin her health, but not that of others.</p>

<p>She questioned why the tobacco industry didn't pay for the installation of those ventilation systems they recommend.</p>

<p>She thanked the group for offering thoughtful alternatives to provisions in the bill.</p>

<p>Several Councilmembers bantered in a friendly way with Mr. Spinnato, a well-known former New York City Fire Commissioner. Councilmember Michels suggested he use the law as an inducement to travelers concerned about hotel fires, telling them, "Your hotel is smokefree!"</p>

<p><h3><a name=aa12><h3>6. MARGARET HAMBURG, NYC Dept. of Health, for Mayor Giuliani--YEA</p>
</a></h3>
</h3>

<p>Ms. Hamburg called the tobacco industry's attacks and surveys "pseudo-science." She referred to the heated battle in 1988 over the law which first set aside 50% of restaurant seating for nonsmokers. That bill represented a huge change in the day-to-day operation of restaurants in NYC, and was considered one of the toughest laws of its kind at that time. She pointed out that none of the dire predictions that were advanced then came true.</p>

<p>Councilmember Aristotle asked at what level can filtration systems reduce risks _enough_. Ms. Hamburg replied, "Any exposure to a carcinogen that can be prevented should be prevented."</p>

<p>Councilmember Harrison said that the air in Flushing, Queens is bad--how possible is it to differentiate damage from the exhaust of cars or airplanes and smoking? Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of bad air?</p>

<p>Ms. Hamburg replied that epidemiological evidence can provide fairly accurate data differentiating second hand smoke from other pollutants.</p>

<p><h3><a name=aa13><h3>7. Comptroller ALAN HEVESI--YEA</p>
</a></h3>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Hevesi said that he is indeed concerned about the loss of jobs in the city, and referred to Philip Morris' threat as "blackmail."</p>

<p>He said the bill has been weakened in one sense--the present bill no longer requires separate ventilation for small offices.</p>

<p>However, it has tightened up on smoking in day care centers and schools, and no longer exempts restaurants with under 50 seats.</p>

<p>He quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes, saying you had the right to swing your arm till it hits the tip of someone else's nose.</p>

<p><h3><a name=aa15>9. FRED G. SAMPSON, New York State Restaurant Association--NAY</p>
</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Sampson said the bill would hurt the $7 billion New York City hospitality industry.</p>

<p>He questioned if the bill was "too much, too soon." No other Eastern state has done this, he said, and 25-30% of restaurant patrons are smokers.</p>

<p>He said a previous hotel occupancy tax was passed over objections it would hurt business, and now many in the Council want to get rid of it. He also cited the 1986-1993 luxury boat tax which added a 10% surcharge on boats costing over $100,000. That tax deeply hurt the boat industry, and had to be repealed.</p>

<p>Mr. Sampson suggested reducing the smoking section to 25%, and then do a study of its impact; if there is no impact, then go ahead and phase out smoking. This was a change from his testimony in June, wherein he said the bill should not exclude restaurants with under 50 seats. "If you do it, do it all the way."</p>

<p><h3><a name=aa16>10. SCOTT WEXLER, United Restaurant Hotel Tavern Association--NAY</p>
</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Wexler had testified with Mr. Sampson at the June meeting.</p>

<p>He said today that URHTA had been around for 60 years and represents 500 New York City members. He said restaurant owners feel whether to allow smoking or not is THEIR business. He then read a letter from a restaurant owner who wanted to "accommodate our customers who smoke."</p>

<p>Council Chair Williams asked Mr. Wexler who paid for URHTA's ads the previous week.</p>

<p>Wexler replied, "We approached the Tobacco Institute--" and was interrupted by jeers and laughter from the audience.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams said,  "We don't want this type of pressure against this body when considering health legislation. . . We take offense to it . . . I don't think you help your cause when you participate in this sort of organization."</p>

<p>Mr. Wexler replied, "We felt we had no alternative."</p>

<p>Councilmember Michels asked how much the ads cost. Mr. Wexler said he didn't know. For a full page ad in the Times, Michels asked, are we talking around $50,000? Mr. Wexler said he supposed so, but hadn't seen the figures, as the ads were sponsored by the Tobacco Institute.</p>

<p>Michels asked how much URHTA's members pitched in. "Not a lot," said Wexler.</p>

<p>Michels said, maybe they don't want to put their money where their mouth is.</p>

<p>Wexler said, maybe they're being taxed to death by New York City.</p>

<p>Michels said, other businesses do stand to benefit from smoking--businesses like Sloan-Kettering hospital and others.</p>

<p>Wexler said, people can choose their restaurants.</p>

<p>Michels said, people can choose their hospital.</p>

<p>Councilmember Wooten said the council is very concerned with business' worries, and, she emphasized, "We are _listening_."</p>

<p>Councilmember John A. Fusco said he'd been a small business advocate all his life, but to try to take a health issue and make it a business issue is insulting to him.</p>

<p>He said his grandfather lost his jaw due to tobacco, and "not one scintilla of evidence has negated these (the studies on ETS) findings."</p>

<p>"This is a health issue, period," he said.</p>

<li>JOE CHERNER, Smokefree Educational Services--YEA</li>
<li>DR. WILLIAM CAHAN, lung cancer surgeon, Sloan Kettering--YEA</a></h3></li>

<p>REV. BUTTS said this was a health _and_ a moral issue. He said efforts against the bill were diabolical and insidious, and that Philip Morris will stop at nothing to promote the "most addictive substance known" and  "to keep making money at the expense of our health."</p>

<p>He said this effort to promote and profit from such a damaging product makes the moral issue as important as the health issue.</p>

<p>He said passage of the law will encourage visitors to come to a "progressive city."</p>

<p>JOE CHERNER described his reaction when he read the URHTA ad. First he noted how many times "New York City" and "our city" were mentioned in the ad, and then called restaurant owners he knew. None of them had heard of URHTA.</p>

<p>He started calling information. No URHTA in any of the boroughs of New York City. He finally got their number from information in Albany, New York, a city several hundred miles away.</p>

<p>He asked the person who answered the phone how he might become a member. He was told the Manhattan chapter was "defunct." He asked about Brooklyn. Defunct. Chapters in all the boroughs, he was told, were defunct. "Our representation is upstate," he was told.</p>

<p>Mr. Cherner then said that according to a reporter who had called him, URHTA's radio spots had been done by Young and Rubicam, Philip Morris' ad agency.</p>

<p>Ex-lung surgeon Dr. CAHAN, who called his operating room "Marlboro Country," said he wished those fighting this bill could see someone dying of a smoking-related disease.</p>

<p>Councilmember Michels asked Dr. Cahan if he considered ETS harmful.</p>

<p>Cahan said he did, and cited "lab evidence where smoke has been blown into cages of animals, and cancers formed."</p>

<p>She said 16-20 tobacco lobbyists were brought into the state to fight the law, using similar tactics to the ones used here.</p>

<p>She said the National Smokers' Alliance did at least one mailing which emanated from the office of the Senate Majority leader of the North Carolina House.</p>

<p>She also said the Advocacy Institute claims the NSA got its seed money from Philip Morris.</p>

<p>She said the "Vermont Business and Restaurant Coalition," had to be created by the tobacco industry to fight the bill, as pre-existing organizations supported the ban.</p>

<p>She also said the "accommodation program," was a front for the tobacco industry.</p>

<p>GEORGE MIRANDA spoke against the bill on behalf of the Teamsters, arguing that banning smoking "in company vehicles occupied by more than one person" was unfair and unworkable. The law, he said, would also apply to the trailer part of the truck, and make unloading unnecessarily difficult.</p>

<p>2. He said section 6 of the Act pertains to workplace safety, and subpart G sets ventilation limits on air constituents, including nicotine.</p>

<p>Workplace smoking provisions exist in OSHA law, and therefore preempt local law.</p>

<p>Mr. Turner argues that smoking is only a fractional part of "sick building syndrome," and that many other pollutants exist in indoor air which should be addressed first, preferably though a retrofitting of ventilation systems.</p>
<i>Correction: As opposed to the statement in an earlier version of this document, HBI does _not_ retrofit ventilation systems; it does no such work, but rather provides consultation services.</i>

<p>Ms. HALLIDAY had testified at the earlier hearing in June about the problems she and other waiters suffered working in a small neighborhood restaurant that had no nonsmoking section.</p>

<p>She said that she had begun working as a waitress at 14, amidst thick clouds of smoke in the days before smoking sections.</p>

<p>Since her appearance in June, her restaurant had gone nonsmoking, and most people seemed to like it; the smoking regulars had adjusted, and no business was lost.</p>

<p>ED BERGMAN represented ex-tobacco lobbyist VICTOR CRAWFORD, an ex-Maryland-state-senator-turned-tobacco-lobbyist, who has had emphysema, and lung, liver and throat cancer.</p>

<p>He asked the tobacco lobbyists in the audience to "go home and think about the pain and death you help spread."</p>

<p>KELLY GRAY JOHNSON said she hoped to go on and represent New York in the Miss America contest.</p>

<i>At the last session in June the Council had heard from a long line of people who stayed out of restaurants and testified to the fact that nonsmoking sections don't work.

<p>The council was told earlier today that the Congressional Research Service found fault with the EPA report. This is not true: two economists--not medical scientists--have found fault with some aspects of the report. The CRS has no official position on the EPA report.</p>

<p>The Council should bear in mind that those speaking from the supermarket segments undoubtedly have very close relationships with food/tobacco companies RJ Reynolds (Nabisco) and Philip Morris (Kraft, General Foods)</p>

<p>That's why you see all those Marlboro handbaskets, in your local Grand Union and Sloan's. Those baskets make walking billboards out of unwitting customers, and contribute to that impression among youth--as just cited by the woman from the Institute of Medicine--that 2/3 of people smoke, and that smoking is normal.</p>

<p>And a beer distributor doesn't deliver Miller Beer? Which is owned by Philip Morris (see Mr. Lipsky's testimony)? Anyone who cries "corrupted science" has been listening to no one but the tobacco industry.</p>

<p>I often pass Ms. Halliday's restaurant but never went in because it was small and smoking. But now I'll try it. There are thousands of other potential customers out there who will come out to eat if they can be assured of a smokefree environment.</p>

<h3><a name=aa76results>THE RESULTS</h3>

On December 21, 1994, the New York City Council voted on a weakened Smoke Free Air Act (Restaurants seating under 35, and the bar areas of restaurants were given exceptions). Despite a unprecedentedly massive petition and fax campaign by the National Smokers Association, the measure passed, 36-8.</p>

<p>The Smoke-Free Air Act was signed into law by Mayor Giuliani on January 10, 1995, and took effect on April 10, 1995.</p>

<h2>Smoking-Attributable Mortality -- Mexico, 1992 
</h2>

	<hr>


<p>Cigarette smoking causes neoplastic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases that contribute substantially to disability, death, and medical-care expenditures (1). In the United States, cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death (1). Although the prevalence of cigarette smoking in Mexico (26% in 1993 [2]) is similar to that in the United States, smoking-attributable mortality has not been recently estimated for Mexico or most other developing countries that are experiencing increases in chronic diseases. To assist in the development of programs for preventing tobacco use, the Ministry of Health of Mexico used a modified version of the software program Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Costs (SAMMEC) to estimate smoking-related mortality (3). This report summarizes trends in the occurrence of smoking-related diseases in Mexico and estimates smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost before age 65 years (YPLL-65) in 1992. </p>

<p>Data from the Ministry of Health for 1970, 1980, and 1990 were used to calculate age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 persons for lung cancer, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other smoking-related cancers (e.g., mouth, esophagus, larynx, cervix, bladder, and kidney) (4); rates were directly adjusted to the 1992 population (5). SAMMEC uses smoking prevalence and relative risks for smoking-related diseases to calculate smoking-attributable fractions (the proportions of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking). Because relative risks for smoking-related diseases were unavailable for Mexico, smoking-attributable fractions were estimated (5,6) by using an index based on lung cancer death rates in the United States and Mexico (cigarette smoking accounts for most lung cancer deaths [6]; therefore, the lung cancer death rate in Mexico was used as an overall measure of risk for disease). </p>

<p>The lung cancer index was calculated separately for men and women. For men, the lung cancer rate among women was used as the baseline because the prevalence of smoking among women in Mexico has been low until recently, and the prevalence of other risk factors for lung cancer has been similar among men and women in Mexico. For women, the lung cancer rate among U.S. never smokers was used as the baseline (6,7). The index was multiplied by SAMMEC disease-specific smoking-attributable fractions to obtain adjusted disease-specific smoking-attributable fractions for Mexico. The number of deaths from each smoking-related disease in 1992 was multiplied by the respective adjusted smoking-attributable fraction to estimate the smoking-attributable mortality for Mexico and was used to estimate YPLL-65 associated with cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>During 1970-1990, death rates for all major smoking-related diseases in Mexico increased substantially, ranging from a 60% increase in the death rate for cerebrovascular disease to a 220% increase in the death rate for lung cancer (Table 1, page 379).</p>

<p>When the lung cancer rate among women was used to estimate the baseline risk for men, the numbers of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL-65 among men in 1992 were 6875 and 25,172, respectively (Table 2, page 379). When the lung cancer rate among U.S. never smokers was used to estimate the baseline risk among women in Mexico, the numbers of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL-65 among women in Mexico in 1992 were 3378 and 14,996, respectively. The total numbers of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL-65 in Mexico in 1992 were 10,253 and 40,168, respectively. Most smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL-65 among men and women were associated with cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. </p>

<p><h3>Editorial Note:</h3>

The findings in this report document the substantial impact of cigarette smoking on premature mortality in adults in Mexico. Death rates from the leading causes of smoking-related deaths have nearly tripled since 1970 in Mexico. Based on this analysis, the proportion of deaths attributable to smoking in Mexico is 9%, compared with 32% in the United States for the same categories of deaths considered in this report. These differences may be attributable to lower cigarette consumption in Mexico compared with the United States. However, as the population of Mexico ages and the average duration of smoking increases, the number of smoking-attributable deaths probably will increase.</p>

<p>The estimates of the total number of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL-65 in Mexico during 1992 probably are low for at least three reasons. First, baseline lung cancer rates for U.S. never smokers probably reflect effects of occupational or environmental exposures and, therefore, may have produced lower estimates of excess risk in Mexico. Second, estimates of smoking-attributable mortality in Mexico do not include deaths from burns, stillbirths, and sudden infant death syndrome or deaths occurring during the perinatal period because these risks are unknown and could not be extrapolated from known risks in the United States. Third, smoking-attributable mortality estimates for 1992 reflect the lower prevalences of smoking in previous decades and may not fully capture increases in mortality resulting from recent changes in smoking patterns. In addition, because this study used adjusted smoking-attributable fractions, the association between smoking-related behaviors (i.e., duration and amount of smoking, depth of inhalation, or use of filtered-tip cigarettes) and smoking-related diseases could not be examined. Ongoing examination of the relation between smoking and disease in Mexico will improve the accuracy of future estimates.</p>

<p>In Mexico, because chronic diseases (including neoplasms and cardiovascular disease) are emerging as leading causes of death (4), the prevention of tobacco use is a major priority. The findings in this report will assist in refining policies to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking and risks for associated diseases and to counter the impact of increased tobacco advertising and other marketing strategies (8). Priority measures may include preventing the initiation of cigarette smoking among children and adolescents, increasing smoking cessation among adult smokers, developing health education programs, and establishing legislative policies (e.g., regulating and restricting the advertisement and promotion of tobacco products, restricting or banning tobacco sales to minors, and increasing tobacco taxes and prices [9]). </p>

<p>Dear Mr. Pearlstine:</p>

<p>Teenage smoking is a national epidemic with profound medical consequences. Every day 3,000 children start to smoke. Nearly 1,000 of these kids will become addicted to nicotine and eventually die from lung cancer, heart disease or other illnesses caused by smoking.</p>

<p>Last week, the President of the United States addressed the magnitude of this public health crisis and proposed regulations to curb teen-age smoking. The President correctly identified tobacco advertising in magazines read by large numbers of children as one of the principal factors in teen-age smoking. In the President's words, this advertising is "designed to reach children so we get new customers for the tobacco companies as the old customers disappear"; it is part of "the seduction of skilled marketing campaigns aimed at exploiting their insecurities and uncertainties about life."</p>

<p>Your magazine, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, is one of the leading outlets for tobacco advertising designed to entice children to start smoking. Every issue of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED is read by millions of American children. As these kids read about the lives and achievements of their sports heros, they are literally bombarded by advertising promoting the virtues of smoking. </p>

<p>The July 31, 1995, issue of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED demonstrates how the tobacco companies are using your magazine to hook children. This issue contains five full-page advertisements for cigarettes. One two-page ad features Team Penske, the car-racing team sponsored by Philip Morris, displaying five Marlboro logos. The aption is "Marlboro Team Penske/Follow Us." An ad for Camel cigarettes advertises the Camel collector's pack, urging kids to "collect all ten, before they are history, again." </p>

<p>The tobacco industry's advertising budget has exploded from less than $500 million in 1970 to over $6 billion today. This omnipresent assault is achieving its goal: more of our youth are smoking and a new generation of Americans is turning into nicotine addicts. We are confident that this is not your intent. But without question, it is the effect of the tobacco advertisements in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.</p>

<p>We call upon you to stop publishing tobacco advertisements in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED voluntarily. The tobacco industry has already filed a lawsuit to derail the President's initiative. Similiar efforts will likely be made in Congress. These efforts, however, do not need to delay voluntary action by responsible publications to stop exposing children to msnipulative tobacco advertisements. </p>

<p>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED has taken courageous stands in the past on environmental problems, teen-age gambling, and other important issues facing our society. Now that the President and the entire U.S. medical establishment have found that tobacco advertisements in magazines like SPORTS ILLUSTRATED entice children to smoke, we ask you to take a similar step on tobacco by putting the health of our children ahead of the magazine's corporate profits. </p>

<p>As you consider your responsibilities on this issue, we urge you to consider the example of McDonald's, Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, and many other restaurants that serve children. At the urging of many of us, these responsible corporations have already voluntarily agreed to go smoke-free.</p>

<p>We request that you publish this letter in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. We also respectfully request the opportunity to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss our concerns further. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<br>Rep. HENRY WAXMAN
<br>Sen. BILL BRADLEY

<p>The July 21, 1995, issue of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) contains the article, "Trends in Smoking Initiation Among Adolescents and Young Adults--United States, 1980-1989." The study found that adolescent smoking initiation rates decreased slightly from 1980 through 1984, and then increased through 1989. Cigarette marketing practices appeared to be the factor most likely to account for this increase in teen smoking initiation rates. The study also found:</p>

* This lack of progress in decreasing smoking among youth resulted in more than 600,000 additional teenagers starting to smoke.

* During the 1980s, cigarette promotional expenditures (in 1993 dollars) more than quadrupled, from $771 million in 1980 to $3.2 billion in 1989. The largest increase in adolescent smoking initiation was in 1988, the year that the Joe Camel cartoon character was introduced nationally.

* The most recent national survey data show that adolescent smoking rates continue to rise. To reverse this trend, intensified youth prevention efforts are needed, such as restricting the features of cigarette advertising and promotion that appeal to youths, conducting mass media campaigns, strictly enforcing laws that prohibit tobacco sales to minors, and increasing cigarette excise taxes.

<p>Another significant study released today, the Monitoring the Future Study, from the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, contains 1994 smoking prevalence data for eighth and tenth graders, and high school seniors. This research shows a continued increase from 1991 to 1994 in smoking prevalence among teenagers of all ages.</p>

<p>Smoking rates climb among American teen-agers, who find smoking increasingly acceptable and seriously underestimate the risks. </p>

<p>FOR RELEASE AT 6:00 A.M. EDT, THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1995. </p>

<p>EDITORS: For more information about the study, contact Lloyd D. Johnston, Ph.D., the principal investigator, at (313) 763-5043. </p>


<p>ANN ARBOR---Reporting on their 20th national survey of American high school seniors, and their fourth national survey of eighth- and tenth-grade students, scientists at the University of Michigan Survey Research Center conclude that cigarette smoking is rising among young Americans.</p>

<p>For more than a decade we have been reporting that the smoking rate among American high school seniors was holding constant despite the accumulating evidence of smoking's lethal effects, despite the many new restrictions on cigarette smoking, and despite the fact that smoking has fallen considerably among adults, states Lloyd D. Johnston, the principal investigator of the study.</p>

<p>Johnston and colleagues Jerald G. Bachman and Patrick M. O'Malley have directed the Monitoring the Future Study of licit and illicit drug use for over 20 years, under a series of research grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>We are now in a period of clear and continuing increase in cigarette smoking among teens. Twelfth-graders showed an increase in smoking which began in 1992, while the eighth- and tenth-graders have shown a steady increase since first surveyed in 1991, states Johnston. (See Figure 1) </p>

<p>This is extremely bad news for the health and longevity of the next generation.</p>

<p>The proportional increase in smoking is greatest among the eighth-graders, who are 13- to 14-years-old. Their rate of current smoking---that is, smoking any cigarettes in the past 30 days---rose by 30 percent between 1991 and 1994, from 14.3 percent to 18.6 percent.</p>

<p>Tenth-graders current smoking rate increased by more than two-tenths, from 20.8 percent to 25.4 percent over the same interval. Among high school seniors, the current smoking rate has been increasing since 1992, and has risen by one-eighth, from 27.8 percent to 31.2 percent in 1994. (See Figure 1 and Table 1.)</p>

<p>While the daily smoking rates are at lower levels, the increases in them are of the same order of magnitude, states Johnston, and, of course, a great many of the lighter smokers at these young ages are on their way to becoming heavy smokers. The daily smoking rates for eighth-, 10th- and 12th-grade students in 1994 are 9 percent, 15 percent, and 19 percent, respectively. </p>

<p>The investigators conclude that teen-agers greatly underestimate the dangers of smoking, with only about half of all eighth-graders believing that smokers run a great risk of harming themselves by smoking a pack or more daily. (See Figure 4.) At 13 to 14 years old, eighth-graders are at an age by which a great many of those who will eventually become smokers have already begun to smoke.</p>

<p>From some of our earlier work we also know that teen-agers greatly overestimate their ability to stop smoking once they have begun, Johnston observes, so they are making decisions about whether or not to smoke at a very early age, with little or no appreciation of the likely consequences of those decisions. </p>

<p>In fact, even before they finish high school, a majority (56 percent) of the half-pack-a-day smokers say they tried to quit smoking and found they could not. Many of them have tried to quit on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>We know that once a birth cohort establishes a particularly high or low rate of smoking in adolescence, relative to other birth cohorts, it continues to maintain a relatively high or low rate throughout the life cycle, adds O'Malley, who has written on this subject using follow-up surveys of previous high school graduating classes. Thus the higher rates that we are observing now are likely to remain high later in life for these children. </p>

<p>The increases in smoking are very broad. They are found among boys and girls, those planning to go to college and those not (the latter tend to have much higher smoking rates), in all regions of the country, and in large cities as well as rural areas. (See Table 2.) The investigators also note that the increases are found at all socioeconomic levels and in all three of the largest racial/ethnic groups (whites, African-Americans and Hispanics).</p>

<p>No segment of the population is being spared these increases, so all parents should be concerned, caution the investigators. </p>

<p>As to the likely causes of this recent upturn in smoking among American youth, the investigators point to several factors. In addition to their unrealistically low perception of the dangers of smoking, there has been a clear weakening of peer norms against smoking, Johnston points out. (See Figure 3 and Table 3.) While the majority still say they disapprove of regular smoking, that proportion has been declining steadily since the early 1990s.</p>

<p>In the larger context, of course, we still must explain why these smoking-related attitudes are changing, or in the case of perceived risk, why they are not changing, Johnston says. The dangers teens associate with regular pack-a-day smoking have held fairly steady in recent years and even may have begun to decline in 1994. (See Figure 4 and Table 3.)</p>

<p>For one thing, children are bombarded with images of the benefits of smoking by an industry advertising and promotion effort which approaches five billion dollars per year. Cigarette smoking is continually associated with social success, sexual attractiveness, a healthy demeanor, exciting sporting activities, a cool and tough image for the boys, a slender body and liberated spirit for the girls, autonomy and independence for both sexes, and so on, says Johnston. What else could an American adolescent want?</p>

<p>And, in case the younger children don't get the point, they now have a cartoon character with which to identify. Past research has shown that he is widely known to them. </p>

<p>Further, many movies and television programs portray smoking as more common and socially acceptable than it in fact is among the general population, Johnston adds, and it is my impression that smoking by the characters in movies and television dramas has become even more frequent.</p>

<p>But, even if it just held steady, it would present an unrealistic portrayal, because among adults both the use of cigarettes and the acceptability of smoking have been declining substantially. </p>

<p>Price is still another factor which may have contributed to the increase in smoking by young people, according to the investigators. The tobacco companies cut prices on major brands beginning in early 1993. In addition, the many new promotional prizes in effect reduce the price of the product and serve to reward use.</p>

<p>The investigators find that cigarettes are almost universally available to teen-agers. Three-quarters of eighth-graders and 90 percent of 10th-graders say that cigarettes are fairly easy or very easy for them to get. The investigators do not even bother to ask 12th-graders the question, believing that virtually all of them would report easy access to cigarettes. (See Table 3.) There is no evidence that availability has changed much, however. We have never made a serious effort to control children's access to cigarettes, which itself sends a message that adults don't care much if they smoke, observes Johnston. </p>

<p>The recent increase in cigarette smoking coincides with a sharp increase in marijuana use among American teens, as reported by the same study, and the investigators observe that the increase in smoking may in fact be contributing to the rise in marijuana use. Cigarette smoking and marijuana smoking are very highly correlated, with cigarette smoking usually coming first, notes Johnston. When you think about it, in order to smoke marijuana, youngsters must learn to take smoke into their lungs, which is not a normal behavior for any species. Cigarette smoking provides excellent training for just that. </p>

<p>The implication of this increase in adolescent smoking for the country's future rates of disease, early death, disrupted families, worker productivity, and health care costs cannot be overestimated, say the investigators. As we and many others have observed previously, cigarettes will kill far more of today s children than all other drugs combined, including alcohol. But because these consequences do not emerge for a few decades, we seem to be much less concerned about them. If cigarette smoking killed quickly, like drunk driving does, the country would be treating the current rates of adolescent smoking as an extreme emergency.</p>

<p>The study, titled Monitoring the Future, was also widely known as the National High School Senior Survey. It has been conducted under a series of research grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Surveys have been carried out each year since 1975 by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. In 1994, the seniors comprised about 16,000 seniors in 139 public and private high schools nationwide, selected to be representative of all seniors in the continental United States. They completed self-administered questionnaires given to them in their classrooms by U-M personnel. Beginning in 1991, similar surveys of nationally representative samples of eighth- and 10th-graders have been conducted annually. The 1994 eighth-grade sample contained about 18,000 students in 150 schools, and the 10th-grade sample contained 16,000 students in 130 schools. In all, approximately 50,000 students in about 420 public and private secondary schools are now surveyed annually. </p>

<h3><a name=aa3><p>Trends in Smoking Initiation Among Adolescents and Young Adults -- United States, 1980-1989</p>
</a></h3>

<p>The evaluation of efforts to prevent tobacco use among adolescents requires accurate surveillance of both smoking prevalence and smoking initiation rates. Although several surveillance systems provide timely data about adolescent smoking prevalence (1), data characterizing rates of smoking initiation among adolescents have been limited. To improve characterization of trends in smoking initiation among young persons, data from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the 1992 and 1993 Current Population Surveys (CPS) (2) were used to estimate smoking initiation rates for persons who were adolescents (aged 14-17 years) or young adults (aged 18-21 years) during 1980-1989. This report summarizes the results of that analysis. </p>

<p>The CPS are monthly surveys of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 15 years (2). Approximately 56,000 households are surveyed each month; one household respondent provides information about all household members aged greater than or equal to 15 years. Questions about tobacco use were added to the September 1992, January 1993, and May 1993 monthly surveys. The response rates for the three surveys were 84.7%, 84.9%, and 82.0%, respectively (N=293,543 household members). To minimize biases that could result from discrepancies between self reports and proxy reports of smoking behavior (3), this analysis used data from self-respondents only (82% of total sample). Ever smokers were defined as respondents who answered "yes" to the question, "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?" Ever smokers were asked, "How old were you when you started smoking cigarettes fairly regularly?" To restrict the analysis to persons who were adolescents or young adults for some period during 1980-1989, only respondents aged 17-34 years at interview were included. The final sample consisted of 71,321 persons, of whom 27,768 (38.9%) were ever smokers.</p>

<p>Using the age of respondents at the time of the interview and the age they reported starting smoking, the age of respondents and their smoking status were calculated for each year during the 1980s. The denominator for the initiation rate for a given year was the number of respondents at risk for initiating smoking during that year (persons already smoking were eliminated from the denominator for that year). The numerator was the number of respondents who reported initiating smoking during that year. Data were weighted by age, sex, and race/ethnicity to provide national estimates.</p>

<p>Among adolescents, the smoking initiation rate decreased slightly from 1980 (5.4%) through 1984 (4.7%) and then increased through 1989 (5.5%); the largest annual increase occurred in 1988 (Figure 1). In comparison, among young adults, initiation rates decreased throughout the 1980s (Figure 1). For both age groups, initiation rates and trends were similar for males and females. Reported by: KM Cummings, PhD, D Shah, MS, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York. DR Shopland, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.</p>

<p>Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate an increase in the rate of initiation of cigarette smoking among adolescents from 1985 through 1989, a period during which the rate among young adults declined and overall prevalence of smoking among adults decreased steadily (4). One important consequence of the increased rate of initiation among adolescents will be the increased future burden of tobacco- related disease. In particular, because of the increase in initiation since 1984, an additional 600,000 adolescents began to smoke during 1985-1989.* Of those adolescents who continue to smoke regularly, approximately 50% will die from smoking-attributable disease (5). </p>

<p>Potential reasons for an increase in smoking initiation rates among adolescents include a decreased real price of cigarettes, increased levels of disposable income, increased acceptability of smoking, and intensified cigarette marketing (1). However, because the real price of cigarettes increased steadily during 1985-1989 and the real average weekly income among high school seniors remained stable during this period, cigarettes were less affordable to young persons (1,6) (Table 1). In addition, the acceptability of smoking among high school seniors did not increase: during this period there were increases in the percentages of high school seniors who believed cigarettes are harmful, smoking is a "dirty habit," and becoming a smoker reflects poor judgment, and who reported they "mind being around people who are smoking" and would prefer to date nonsmokers (1). </p>

<p>The increase in rates of smoking initiation among adolescents during 1985-1989 may reflect increased real expenditures for cigarette advertising and promotion. The increase in rates occurred during a period when real expenditures for total cigarette advertising and promotion** doubled, and expenditures for cigarette promotion more than quadrupled (7) (Figure 2): from 1980 to 1989, total annual advertising and promotional expenditures (in 1993 dollars) increased from $2.1 billion to $4.2 billion, while promotional expenditures alone increased from $771 million (37% of total expenditures) to $3.2 billion (76%) (Figure 2). Promotional efforts have been highly effective among adolescents. For example, among persons aged 12-17 years in 1992, approximately 50% of smokers and 25% of nonsmokers reported having received promotional items from tobacco companies (1).</p>

<p>An association between overall cigarette marketing expenditures and initiation rates for smoking among adolescents is plausible for at least four reasons. First, brand loyalty is usually established with the first cigarette smoked (8); therefore, cigarette companies have an economic incentive to encourage first-time smokers to smoke their brands. Second, adolescents are exposed to cigarette advertising and promotions that employ themes and images that appeal to young persons (1). Third, advertising directly influences brand awareness and attitudes toward smoking among adolescents (1). Specifically, adolescents smoke the most heavily advertised brands, and changes in brand preferences among young persons are associated with changes in brand-specific advertising expenditures (9). For example, the Joe Camel campaign introduced nationally in 1988 was associated with an increase in the market share of that specific brand among adolescents (1,9). Finally, consumer research suggests that younger persons (i.e., aged 14-17 years) aspire to be young adults (10); therefore, advertising and promotional efforts targeted toward young adults may have greater appeal to adolescents because of their age aspirations. </p>

<p>Although current estimates of smoking initiation rates among adolescents are not available, from 1991 through 1993, the national prevalence of smoking increased among eighth- and 10th-grade students (6). To reverse the trend of increasing smoking initiation rates among adolescents and to achieve the national health objective for the year 2000 of reducing the initiation of cigarette smoking by youth (no more than 15% should become regular smokers by age 20) (objective 3.5) (4), prevention efforts that focus on young persons should be intensified. Such efforts could include making cigarettes less affordable by either increasing their real price (1) or by limiting sales to cartons rather than individual packs, enforcing laws prohibiting the sale and distribution of cigarettes to young persons (4), conducting mass media campaigns to discourage tobacco use (1), and eliminating or severely restricting all forms of tobacco product advertising and promotion to which young persons are likely to be exposed (4).</p>

<h2><center>Jan. 4, 1954: TIRC Announced
</center></h2>

<p>The founding of the Tobacco Industry Research Council is a seminal  moment in the history not just of tobacco but of public relations.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1954, in response to continuing scientific reports on the  health effects of smoking, "the TIRC ... ran a full-page promotion in more  than 400 newspapers aimed at an estimated 43 million Americans,"  according to papers filed in the 1995 Florida Medicaid lawsuit.</p>

<p>The ad was sponsored by the TIRC, a listed group of 14 tobacco companies  and trade associations. Text of the ad, as presented in the Florida papers,  follows:</p>

<h3>A Frank Statement To Cigarette Smokers </h3>

<p>RECENT REPORTS on experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings.</p>

<p>Although conducted by doctors of professional standing, these experiments are not regarded as conclusive in the field of cancer research. However, we do not believe results are inconclusive, should be disregarded or lightly dismissed. At the same time, we feel it is in the public interest to call attention to the fact that eminent doctors and research scientists have publicly questioned the claimed significance of these experiments.</p>

<p>Distinguished authorities point out:</p>

<p>That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer.</p>

<p>That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is.</p>

<p>That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.</p>

<p>That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life. Indeed the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.</p>

<p>We accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business</p>

<p>We believe the products we make are not injurious to health.</p>

<p>We always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.</p>

<p>For more than 300 years tobacco has given solace, relaxation, and enjoyment to mankind. At one time or another during those years critics have held it responsible for practically every disease of the human body. One by one these charges have been abandoned for lack of evidence.</p>

<p>Regardless of the record of the past, the fact that cigarette smoking today should even be suspected as a cause of a serious disease is a matter of deep concern to us.</p>

<p>Many people have asked us what we are doing to meet the public's concern aroused by the recent reports. Here is the answer:</p>

<p>We are pledging aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health. This joint financial aid will of course be in addition to what is already being contributed by individual companies.</p>

<p>For this purpose we are establishing a joint industry group consisting initially of the undersigned. This group will be known as TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCH COMMITTEE.</p>

<p>In charge of the research activities of the Committee will be a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national repute. In addition there will be an Advisory Board of scientists disinterested in the cigarette industry. A group of distinguished men from medicine, science, and education will be invited to serve on this Board. These scientists will advise the Committee on its research activities.</p>

<p>This statement is being issued because we believe the people are entitled to know where we stand on this matter and what we intend to do about it.</p>

<h2> 1ST SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
</h2>

<p>On January 11, 1964, 200 reporters were locked into the State Department's auditorium to hear a two hour briefing by surgeon general Dr. Luther L. Terry and a panel of experts. The measures were felt necessary because of the bold and closely-guarded conclusion reached in the brown paperback book titled Smoking and Health. In 1964 the US was a country where over 50% of adult males smoked, and where a multi-billion dollar industry seemed to hang by the book's astounding verdict: smoking causes cancer.</p>

<p>At the time, 46% of all Americans smoked; smoking was accepted in offices, airplanes and elevators, and TV programs were sponsored by cigarette brands.</p>

<p>Within 3 months of Terry's report, cigarette consumption had dropped 20%, but was soon to climb back.</p>

<p>"It was a very dramatic and courageous thing to do," said Joseph Califano, the top domestic policy aide to President Johnson.</p>

<p>But the Johnson Administration had enough on its plate, and didn't want to complicate more pressing issues by addressing the implications. "We wanted to get schools integrated, the voters' rights act passed, fair housing passed. And all of those things required us to take on the whole phalanx of Southern states," Califano said.</p>

<h2><p>Assessment of the Impact of a 100% Smoke-Free Ordinance on Restaurant Sales -- West Lake Hills, Texas, 1992-1994 </p>
</h2>


	<hr>

<p>Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which is associated with adverse health effects among nonsmokers (1), is a health hazard of particular concern for patrons and employees in restaurants (2). To protect nonsmokers, many local governments have enacted ordinances requiring restaurants to be smoke-free. However, the potential economic impact of these laws on restaurants is an important concern for restaurant owners. On June 1, 1993, the city of West Lake Hills (a suburb of Austin), Texas (1995 population: 3000), implemented an ordinance requiring a 100% smoke-free environment in all commercial establishments to which the public has access, including all restaurants and restaurants with bar areas. This report summarizes an assessment of sales in restaurants during June 1993-December 1994 compared with January 1992-May 1993. </p>

<p>Restaurants in West Lake Hills had a variety of menus and food-pricing scales. Restaurant sales data for West Lake Hills were obtained from the Texas State Comptroller's office. Aggregate monthly sales data* from January 1992 through December 1994 were obtained for the eight restaurants in West Lake Hills that had indoor dining areas and were in operation during all of 1992 and until the ordinance went into effect in June 1993 (one of these restaurants closed in April 1994 because its lease expired). These sales data included the 17-month period preceding implementation of the ordinance (January 1992-May 1993) and the 19-month period following implementation (June 1993-December 1994). Restaurants that opened during the assessment period were not included in the analysis because the purpose of the study was to assess the impact of the ordinance on a consistent panel of restaurants (five restaurants opened during September 1992-July 1994). </p>

<p>Data were analyzed using a linear regression model (3) that examined the relation between total restaurant sales and the presence of a smoke-free ordinance and that incorporated seasonal variations in sales and temporal economic trends. For each factor examined (i.e., time [year and month], quarter of the year, and presence of the implemented ordinance), a corresponding regression coefficient was calculated to measure the effect of that factor on total restaurant sales. A positive regression coefficient suggests that the factor was associated with increased total restaurant sales, and a negative value suggests that the factor was associated with decreased total restaurant sales. To test for multicollinearity, variance inflation factors were computed for each independent variable in the model. The Durbin-Watson statistic was computed (4) to test for first-order autocorrelation (correlation of the residuals [error terms] for adjacent observations over time).</p>

<p>Total monthly sales for the restaurants during 1992-1994 varied by season. Sales peaked during the second quarter of each year.</p>

<p>In the initial regression model, the variance inflation factors for the ordinance variable and the year variable were above four, indicating multicollinear involvement between these variables. To address the multicollinearity, the time variable was removed: although reanalysis did not change the regression coefficient for the ordinance variable, the standard error was substantially decreased. The variance inflation factors for this final model indicated that multicollinearity was no longer present, and the Durbin-Watson statistic indicated that significant first-order autocorrelation was not present (Table 1). </p>

<p>The regression coefficient for the second quarter of the year was positive, suggesting that restaurant sales were greater in the second quarter of each year than in the first quarter (Table 1). The regression coefficient for the ordinance variable was positive, suggesting that the total sales of the restaurants did not decrease after implementation of the ordinance.</p>

<p><h3>Editorial Note:</h3>

The findings in this report are consistent with assessments using similar methods in other locations that have reported that the implementation of smoke-free ordinances has not been associated with adverse economic effects on restaurants (3,5,6).</p>

<p>Previous reports of decreases in restaurant sales following the enactment of clean indoor air ordinances have been based on anecdotal information (7-10), on studies that used restaurant owners' self-reports of the impact on their business instead of validated sales data (7,8), and on studies that used tax data to measure restaurant sales but collected data for only one or two quarters following implementation of ordinances (9,10). In comparison, the assessment in West Lake Hills was based on sales data that were validated by tax revenue reported by the State Comptroller's office, included data for periods of time sufficient for statistical analysis, and employed multiple linear regression techniques to account for temporal trends and seasonal variations in sales.</p>

<p>The findings in this assessment are subject to at least three limitations. First, because of limitations in data, an ordinary least squares regression model--which assumes no autocorrelation--was used in place of a more specific time series model; however, the Durbin-Watson statistic indicated that significant autocorrelation was not present. Second, the model only explained 33% of the variation in total restaurant sales; future studies may benefit from the inclusion of other variables that can affect restaurant sales. Third, because the assessment focused on a consistent panel of restaurants and excluded restaurants that opened during the assessment period, the findings cannot be generalized to all restaurants in West Lake Hills. </p>

<p>The economic impact of smoke-free ordinances is an important consideration for policymakers concerned about the ETS exposure of nonsmokers; assessment of the potential economic impact of these laws should be based on the most objective, scientific evidence available. The findings from the assessment in West Lake Hills has provided policymakers in that community with a scientific appraisal of the impact of public health measures to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke. In addition, the assessment in West Lake Hills provides a model for other local and state public agencies to consider when evaluating tobacco-control programs. </p>

<i>From The GENTLE ART OF SMOKING (1954)
<p>by Alfred H. Dunhill Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 54-10495</p>
</i>
<p><h3>SMOKING IN ENGLAND--ELIZABETHAN</h3>
</p>

<p>Opinion is still divided about which of the sea captains or colonists in the  time of Hawkins and Drake was the first to introduce the plant into the  country, and we can be sure only that smoking slowly established itself in  England between 1565 and 1590. From the first, however, Englishmen seem  to have been more concerned with the pleasures offered by tobacco than with  its medical virtues. No doubt the English sailors were the first to become  acquainted with cigar and pipe smoking from their rivals in Spanish,  Portuguese, French, and Flemish ships; some soldiers may have collected  tobacco pipes from the Huguenots with whom they fought in France. Smoking  was doubtless a familiar practice in the ports of England before the  frequently quoted incident of Drake's return from Virginia with a number of  colonists in 1586. These men brought with them pipes, tobacco seeds, and  plants, and their example of what was at first called "drinking" tobacco  smoke (inhaling and apparently swallowing it) is known to have caused  considerable excitement and interest. From that time, at any rate, smoking  developed from the private pleasure of a few "tobacconists"--as the first  smokers were called--into a social practice.</p>
<p>A tremendous impetus was doubtless given to the habit by the influence  and patronage of so distin guished a man as Sir Walter Raleigh. Every school  boy knows the story of the servant who found Raleigh smoking and who,  thinking that his master was on fire, drenched him with beer. Many fabulous  stories have attached themselves to the name of Raleigh, who has ahnost  been regarded as the patron saint of smoking; though most of these are  probably fictitious, and Raleigh was certainly not the first to introduce the  plant, he perfected a method of curing the leaf and helped to popularize  smoking among the courtiers of his day. But smoking was an expensive  pleasure; the poor took to it very slowly. Some seventy years later Aubrey  wrote in his comments on Raleigh: "It [tobacco] was sold then for its weight  in Silver. I have heard some of our old yeomen neighbouts say that when they  went to Malmesbury or Chippenham market, they culled out their biggest  shillings to lay in the Scales against the Tobacco." And so, while the  Elizabethan dandies with their starched ruffs, gilthandled swords, and velvet  breeches took boxes of silver pipes to the theater, clay pipes were passed  from hand to hand in the so-called "tabagies"--meeting places resembling  ordinary taverns. And the poor man had to content himself with a pipe made  from a walnut shell and a straw stem.</p>
<p>The contemporary writer Dekker employs the term "artillery" to describe  the elaborate smoking paraphernalia of these fashionable dandies who,  especially at the Elizabethan theater, earned themselves the title of "reeking  gallants." Such a "tobacconist" might carry a set of Winchester clays (or  those ornamented with silver and gold), an ivory or metal box which  contained up to a pound of tobacco, silver tongs for lifting the glowing ember  to light his pipe, a pick, a knife to shred the tobacco, and a small scoop for  drying the leaf. With such equipment a gallant might sit on a stool at the side  of the stage and, "clowding the loathing ayr with foggie fume," as one  observer put it, embarrass the actors with his audible criticism. Serving  boys supplied lights which were passed from one gallant to another on the  point of a sword. It is therefore not surprising that a citizen's wife in a  contemporary play should remark, "This stinking tobacco kills men. Would  there were none in England."</p>

<p>In order to share his pleasure with different company the gallant might  direct his steps to St. Paul's-the fashionable resort and meeting place of  sporting men and swaggcrers. There, it was said, a man could "spit private"  and the uninitiated could receive instruction in the solemn ritual of smoking.  He could learn to display the fashionable tricks such as "The Ring," "The  Whiffe," "The Gulp," and "The Retention"--always "putting the fume through  his nose"--and the bizarre fads which would establish him among the  "reeking gallants" as an accomplished smoker. From St. Paul's the  "tobacconist" might wander to a "tobacco ordinary," or to the shop of a  tobacco-seller--a trade rated almost as low as that of usury--or, turning  into the Mermaid Tavern, he might watch the famous writers of the day  smoking their pipes with rather less fuss and excitement. Meanwhile Dekker,  Marston, Chapman, and many others were writing their lampoons on the  subject, which was already arousing criticism from moralists and clergy. It  is therefore simple to imagine the amusement of an audience which heard the  water-carrier in Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour make the following  observation about "roguish tobacco":</p>

<p>It's good for nothing but to choke a man, and fill him full of smoke and  embers: there were four died out of one house, last week, with taking of it,  and two more the bell went for, yesternight: one of them, they say, will ne'er  scape it; hc voided a bushel of soot yesterday, upward and downward. By the  stocks, and there were no wiser men than I, I'd have it present whipping,  man, or woman, that should but deal with a tobacco pipe: why, it will stifle  them all in the end, as many as use it: it's little better than ratsbane [white  arsenic] ....</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of satire that was bound to make sport of a habit which was  taking society by storm, by  16oo smoking ranked in the life of a fashionable  man with dancing, riding, hunting, and card playing. It is therefore surprising  that there is no direct reference to it in the plays of Shakespeare. He may of  course have considered that the subject was already threadbare, or he may  have wished to remain persona grata at Court, For at the turn of the  seventeenth century King James I became the center of the opposition to  tobacco which did its utmost to stamp out the "Indian vice."</p>

<p>THE COUNTERBLASTE</p>

<p>Some pamphleteers insisted that smoking caused sterility, and innumerable  diseases. Others, supporting the medical virtues of tobacco, thought it  illogical to use the weed for pleasure. Indignation at the extravagant smoking  habits of the gallants found fulfillment in the famous Counterblast to  Tobacco published by James I in 16o4. This, reflecting much of the King's  narrow-mindedness, proclaimed that the habit had been acquired from  barbarous people, that "smoking gallants" were a social menace, that doctors  regarded the habit as dirty and injurious to health, and that to foster the  tobacco trade meant playing into the hands of Spanish enemies. The treatise  concludes by stating that smoking is "a custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull  to the nose, harmefull to the braine, daungerous to the Lungs, and in the  blacke stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke  of the pit that is bottomelesse."</p>
<p>In spite of this denunciation from the throne and a subsequent increase in  the duty on tobacco (which inevitably encouraged bootlegging, smuggling, and  the cultivation of the plant on English soil), the popularity of smoking  continued. The consumption of tobacco from Virginia rose to astonishing  heights. Whereas before 1616 the indifferent plant (Nicotiana rustica) of the  English colonies offered little competition to the popular Spanish leaf  (Nicotiana tabacum) which was grown in the West Indies, Mexico, and the  north of South America, the English colonists, by taking the Spanish plant  from Trinidad and planting it in Virginia, began to trade in earnest. Indeed, it  was largely due to this fact that England kept its hold on North America. In  1616 the first successful shipload of the New Virginjan tobacco was sent  across the Atlantic. When the colonists asked for women to be sent out to  them, their traveling expenses were paid for with tobacco. In 162o forty  thousand pounds of leaf were sent to England, where a guild of pipemakers  had been formed, and the increased duties provided a new and immense  revenue for the King, who had tried to bring this trade to an end. In order to  encourage the colonists, even home-grown tobacco, which was making  progress around Gloucester and Worcester, was officially prohibited. No  wonder that the antiquary Camden, writing in 1625, remarked: "Tobacco  shops are set up in greater numbers than either Alehouses or Tavernes." </p>

<p>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: THE PROBLEM</p>

<p>Easy Access</p>

<p>Despite state laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors, children can easily buy these products. One study estimated that teenagers annually consume 516 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of chewing tobacco. A review of 13 studies of over-the- counter sales found that on average, children and adolescents were able to successfully buy tobacco products 67 percent of the time.</p>

Vending machines are a primary source of tobacco products for young smokers. A study by the vending machine industry found that 22 percent of 13-year-old smokers use vending machines compared with 2 percent of 17-year-old smokers. The 1994 Surgeon General's Report found that young people were able to buy cigarettes in vending machines an average of 88 percent of the time.

<p>Mail-order sales provide no sure way of verifying age. Current industry practice only asks the consumer to provide a birth date or check box to verify age.</p>

<p>Self-service displays allow children to easily obtain tobacco products. The Institute of Medicine, in its landmark 1994 report, "Growing Up Tobacco Free," concluded that placing tobacco products "out of reach reinforces the message that tobacco products are not in the same class as candy or potato chips." </p>

<p>Free samples are obtained by children, including those in elementary school, despite industry code prohibiting distribution to anyone under 21. Free samples occur on street corners, at shopping malls and sporting events. A New Jersey survey found that one-third of high school students who were smokers or ex-smokers reported receiving free samples before age 16. </p>

<p>Appealing to Children</p>

<p>Advertising and promotional activities can greatly influence a young person's decision to smoke or use smokeless tobacco products. Awareness of tobacco products and messages is very high among even the youngest children. Studies show that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent of 6-year-olds could identify "Joe Camel" as a symbol for smoking. The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that 86 percent of underage smokers who purchase their own cigarettes purchase one of the three most heavily advertised brands: Marlboro, Camel and Newport. </p>

<p>Tobacco products are among the most heavily advertised products in the United States. In 1993, the tobacco industry spent $6.2 billion on advertising and promoting cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Tobacco advertising expenditures have increased more than 1,500 percent between 1970 (the year before television and radio advertising was banned) and 1992.</p>

<p>Promotion of tobacco products through non-tobacco items such as t-shirts, hats and gym bags and through sponsorship of events is reaching children. A 1992 Gallup Survey found that half of adolescent smokers and one quarter of adolescents who do not smoke owned at least one tobacco promotional item such as a tee-shirt, cap, sporting good, or lighter. Another report found that one out of four 12- and 13-year-olds own one of these items. Used or worn by young people, these become "walking billboards," promoting these products in schools and other locations where tobacco advertising is usually prohibited. Sponsorship of events such as tennis tournaments, car races, and rodeos associate tobacco products with excitement and glamour, and provide a way for tobacco brands to be advertised on television despite the broadcast advertising ban.</p>

<HR><h3><a name=aa2>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: THE FACTS
</a></h3>

<br>Date: August 10, 1995
<br>For Release: Immediately

<p>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: THE FACTS</p>

<p>The Clinton Administration is proposing a comprehensive and coordinated set of measures to significantly reduce the number of children and adolescents who become addicted to nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco). Children are becoming addicted to these products, with more than 80 percent of smokers beginning to smoke by age 18. </p>

<p>Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, and health care costs associated with smoking soared to more than $50 billion in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control. While the proposed measures will continue to maintain the legal status of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products for adults, they will reduce the easy access and strong appeal for children.</p>

<p>Preventing children from smoking is key to reducing the deadly toll of smoking. The Clinton Administration's plan will help parents provide their children with an environment in which to grow up healthy.</p>

<p>A Pediatric Disease</p>

<p>Children are becoming addicted to nicotine. The average teenage smoker starts at 14 1/2 years old and becomes a daily smoker before age 18. More than 80 percent of all adult smokers had tried smoking by their 18th birthday and more than half of them had already become regular smokers by that age. Studies show that if people do not begin to smoke as teenagers or children, it is unlikely they will ever do so.</p>

<p>Each and every day, another 3,000 young people become regular smokers, and nearly 1,000 of them will eventually die as a result of their smoking. Currently, more than 3 million children and adolescents smoke cigarettes, and 1 million adolescent boys currently use smokeless tobacco. Smoking by young people is rising sharply. Between 1991 and 1994, the percentage of eighth graders who smoke increased 30 percent, and the percentage of tenth graders who smoke increased 22 percent. </p>

<p>Children tend to vastly underestimate the likelihood that they will become addicted to these products. Although only 5 percent of daily smokers surveyed in high school said they would definitely be smoking five years later, close to 75 percent were smoking 7 to 9 years later. A survey conducted in 1992 found that approximately two- thirds of adolescents who smoked said they wanted to quit and 70 percent said they would not start smoking if they could make that choice again.</p>

<p>Smoking: Leading Cause of Avoidable, Premature Death </p>

<p>Tobacco use takes enormous, deadly toll each year. Tobacco products are responsible for more than 400,000 deaths each year due to cancer, respiratory illness, heart disease, and other health problems. Cigarettes kill more Americans each year than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, illegal drugs and fires combined. Smokers who die as a result of smoking would have lived on average 12 to 15 years longer if they had not smoked.</p>

<p>The health care costs associated with tobacco use are rising. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that in 1993 the health care costs associated with smoking totalled $50 billion: $26.9 billion for hospital costs; $15.5 billion for doctors; $4.9 billion in nursing home costs; $1.8 billion for prescription drugs and $900 million for home-health care expenditures. The Office of Technology Assessment calculated the social costs attributable to smoking in 1990 at $68 billion. That calculation was based on $20.8 billion in direct health care costs and $6.9 billion in lost productivity from disabilities and $40.3 billion in lost productivity from premature deaths. </p>

<HR><h3><a name=aa3>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: THE PROPOSAL
</a></h3>

<br>Date: August 10, 1995
<br>For Release: Immediately
<br>Contact: FDA Press Office, (301) 443-1130 

<p>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: THE PROPOSAL</p>

<p>The Clinton Administration is proposing a comprehensive and coordinated plan to reduce smoking by children and adolescents by 50 percent. It builds on previous actions taken by Congress and others such as the ban on television advertising and state laws to prohibit the sale or use of tobacco by children. It follows recommendations by the American Medical Association and the Institute of Medicine. Experts have consistently recommended that the keys to achieving the goal are: reducing access and limiting the appeal for children. This ambitious initiative accomplishes that objective, while preserving the availability of tobacco products for adults. The proposals announced today include:</p>

<p>Reducing Easy Access by Children</p>

<p>Require age verification and face-to-face sale and eliminate mail order sales, vending machines, free samples, self- service displays, and sale of single cigarettes ("loosies") and packages with fewer than 20 cigarettes ("kiddie packs"). </p>

<p>Reducing Appeal to Children</p>

<p>Ban outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds. Permit black-and-white text only advertising for all other outdoor advertising, including billboards, signs inside and outside of buses, and all point-of-sale advertising. </p>

<p>Permit black-and-white text only advertising in publications with significant youth readership (under 18). (Significant readership means more than 15 percent or more than 2 million. No restrictions on print advertising below these thresholds). </p>

<p>Prohibit sale or giveaway of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco product brand names or logos. Prohibit exchange of non-tobacco products for proof of purchase of tobacco products.</p>

<p>Prohibit brand name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events, but permit it in the corporate name. </p>

<p>Require industry to fund ($150 million annually) a public education campaign to prevent kids from smoking. </p>

<p>CHILDREN AND TOBACCO: WHAT OTHERS SAY</p>

<p>"I figure if it's really so bad for you, they wouldn't be selling them everywhere. I mean, you walk into the Stop 'N' Go, and there's a whole wall of them right up front at the cash register. If they were really that bad for you, they'd make them less accessible."</p>

--Brian Grindele, 18
<br>The New York Times, July 30, 1995

<p>"Given all that we know, the scientific case for protecting children from tobacco is indisputable. The moral imperative to act is imperative....This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is a bipartisan, pro-child, pro-family, pro-health issue."</p>

--President Jimmy Carter
<br>USA Today, August 3, 1995

<p>"The tobacco industry continues to insist that smoking is a simple matter of individual rights and adult choice. If that were true, I would be on their side. But we're not talking about adults. We're talking about keeping an addictive and lethal substance out of the hands of children. Neither the FDA nor anyone else is talking about prohibiting adults from smoking." </p>

--Former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater
<br>Wall Street Journal, August 8, 1995

<p>"The American Medical Association reminds physicians, the public, and politicians that the damning evidence against tobacco makes opposition to its use a pressing, nonpartisan public health issue."</p>

--Editorial
<br>Journal of the American Medical Association July 19, 1995

<p>"We believe that current tobacco regulations, limited primarily to a ban on television advertising and the promotion of warning labels on packages, are insufficient in protecting America's children. The FDA should have authority to control tobacco by placing new limits on tobacco advertising, creating stricter licensing regulations for vendors, and banning cigarette vending machines."</p>

--American Public Health Association
<br>Letter to President Clinton from APHA
<br>July 13, 1995

<p>"What is most significant about teens and smoking, however, is that, from all indications, smoking is an addiction that is typically initiated during the teenage years or not at all. For the great majority of smokers, this addiction begins before they are old enough to purchase tobacco lawfully. In fact, 75 percent of all adult smokers report that they became addicted to tobacco before they were 18 years old. Very few smokers take up smoking for the first time as adults. If youth access can be controlled effectively, and the decision whether to smoke can be delayed until adulthood, then, over time, smoking will be greatly reduced as a major addiction in our society."</p>

--"No Sale: Youth, Tobacco and Responsible Retailing" Working Group of State Attorneys General December, 1994

<p>"The nation must commit itself to a vigorous public health initiative in tobacco control....The nation cannot reasonably expect to eliminate tobacco-related disease and death by 2010. However, by putting a youth-centered preventions strategy at the center of tobacco control efforts, and by implementing the initiatives proposed (to that end) in this report, the nation can take a firm and resolute step on that path." </p>

--"Growing Up Tobacco Free"
<br>Institute of Medicine, September, 1994

<p>"The concept--pediatric disease--qualifies as an epiphany, given the acknowledged authority of society over a minor. He/she has to go to school, has to wait until a certain age before being allowed to drive, to vote, to drink beer. It yields no substantial libertarian ground to add to the list enforcement mechanisms designed to dissuade the 15-year-old from taking up a habit that brings on premature and painful death." </p>

--William F. Buckley Jr.
<br>Syndicated columnist, March, 1995

<p>"... from a public-health standpoint, keeping kids away from cigarettes is the single most effective way to fight the nation's leading preventable cause of death."</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The Real Clinton is more or less the opposite of the Real McCoy. What you see is very definitely not what you get, and indeed it may not be what you see a moment or two later. There is a chameleon quality about the 42nd President of the United States, a quicksilver opportunism, that enables him to don and doff identities like cloaks: the New Democrat who promises to end welfare as we know it, the paleo-liberal who takes on the Klan in defense of black churches, the economic statesman who steers by the bond market, the policy wonk avid to socialize one-seventh of the U.S. economy, the moralist who crusades against illegitimacy, the redneck roue with Astroturf in the back of his pick-up, the nostalgia-merchant who wants teenagers home by seven, the futurist with visions of an information superhighway, and at all times and on all occasions the bringer of empathy who feels the pain of that day's audience, whether millionaires or the poor, feminists or Good Ol' Boys, labor unions or blue-chip managements.
<P>
Underneath all the empathy, however, there is a set of policies and attitudes that gives a sort of consistency to his Administration, and even to his personality. In the following pages, we examine this Real Clinton from several angles. We look at Clintonism, that ambidexterity of campaigning right and governing left; at Clinton's steering of the economy by the stars of focus group and polling data; at the multicultural refashioning of the American identity in which he nervously colludes; at his stumblings down the multilateral by-ways of foreign policy, talking loudly and carrying a small stick; at his high-minded healing and sly exploitation of America's most entrenched problem -- race; at the manifold ways in which he, Hillary, and their confederates hidden in the last agencies of the alphabet, have abused federal power to extend their own personal power; and, finally, at that most extraordinary amphibian, Clinton the Bully Pulpiteer. Tales, in short, to / <I>``harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood</I> / <I>make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres</I> / <I>thy knotted and combined locks to part / and each particular hair to stand an end</I> / <I>like quills upon the fretful porpentine.''</I> Now read on.

Newt Gingrich's re-election as speaker of the House of Representatives will have little effect on the 105th Congress, which promises to be the most disappointing sequel since "Jaws 2." As Florence King pointed out in her recent public abandonment of the GOP, national Republicans lack the stones to lead this nation. What I would like Mr. Gingrich and his colleagues to answer is this: What is so alluring about Congress and the Beltway? Is it such a powerful tonic that you would willingly turn your backs on those of us who elected you? Or have you just become rabid Redskins fans?<br>

Since Newt will capitulate to the Democrats and liberal Republicans, the House will be more conciliatory to Billy Boy. The Senate is the last hope of conservatives. We in effect lost the House; if only Newt had not lost his fighting spirit and conservative principals. He should have talked less and acted more (ie; kick their butt, but don't talk about it).<br>

I think Newt is good for Congress, the Republican party, and America! One of can never be 100% sure of anything anybody else does, because we all "fall short of the Glory of God." Compared to so many people in and out of politics, Newt is an angel. I just wish the Republicans and Newt would be more proactive about undoing the damage the liberal establishment is doing. National Review is a great publication, and Rush is working hard to prove to the public that "evidence refutes liberalism," but most grassroots liberals have never heard of NR, and can't stand Rush. Newt's ideas about government and society line up with the ones our founding fathers had when they set out on the great democratic experiment. Now, if only we could get liberalism out of the schools and newspapers, and get people talking about Adam Smith and the Federalist Papers!<br>

It will be hard to keep hitting Clinton for sleaze after the revelations about Newt. Newt's statement that it was the lawyers' fault seems lame as he is still using the lawyer and the lawyer says Newt read and approved everything he submitted. I don't blame Newt for a lot of the troubles he had. He was hemmed in by the new people he had made all hopped up when they were elected. They have learned some from the first term and should do a better job now.<br>

Newt's re-election provides a stabilizing influence on the Republican Revolution. If the Republican conference in the House was to switch leaders midstream, it would send a terrible message and cause much dissent. As for those few Republicans who voted against Newt because his leadership ability is supposedly weakened by ethics charges, do they not believe that members of a Speaker's own party walking away from him weakens his potential as a leader?<br>

Newt is the greatest American since Reagan. I think all this B.S. about his so-called "wrongdoings" will blow over soon and be yesterday's news. Hell, we can't convict Wild Bill, you think that we can even talk about good ol' Newt? I claim no political party and consider myself neutral as far as the left and the right go. But the left needs to get with it: don't go accusing Newt of lining his pockets. All he did is teach a class at college that is one step above a community college. The man has a PhD in European history. If it was money he was interested in he would have went to a university, or better yet, a speaking tour. Lets all get over the petty stuff and start taking care of this great country again. Let's fix our budget (like every American family does), take care of our old people, and our poor people WHO CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES (not lazy people who refuse to work), and get on with being the greatest country in the world.

The OJ trial proved that there was no integrity left in the judicial system; now the re-election of Gingrich as House speaker shows us, if we didn't know already, that there is no integrity left in the legislative branch. We won't even discuss the executive branch.<br>

 Mr. Newt will have a revolutionary impact on the 105th Congress as he continues the revolution from the 104th. Long Live Speaker Newt. Let the cultural revolution begin.<br>

Newt has failed to follow his own standard of conduct for Speakers of the House; he should step down. If one shuts down the government because he rode in coach on Air Force One, and refuses to change the law that allows House members to utilize frequent-flyer mileage accrued on taxpayer trips for personal use, it would indeed be too much to expect him to step down. His book deal that he escaped discipline for profiting from could be added to you outrage list.<br>

<LI>``If the [Republicans] don't come around, we'll use children's health the way we used Medicare, and that's a promise and a commitment,'' AFL-CIO president John Sweeney told the American Public health Association recently. We have been warned: an alleged upsurge in the number of children without health insurance will figure prominently in the liberal establishment's Winter-Spring Offensive. But Merrill Matthews, writing for the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, points out that a) the ``upsurge'' is still quite small; b) costly mandated benefits, like compulsory maternity leave, are forcing employers to cancel health-insurance policies, exposing children; and c), uninsured children are disproportionately immigrants and the children of immigrants -- overall, 40.6 per cent of foreign-born non-citizens were uninsured in 1995, versus only 13.6 per cent of the native-born. ``Any nationwide program for children threatens to evolve into an entitlement program primarily benefitting legal and illegal immigrants,'' writes Matthews. he and the NCPA are to be congratulated for exposing liberal-establishment hokum -- and for ignoring conservative-establishment blindness about the immigrant dimension of  many American policy problems.

<LI>The Clinton Administration wants legalized pot out of California and Arizona and in the White House where it belongs.

<P>

<LI>Soon enough it will be gut-check time again for congressional Republicans on race preferences. Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) is set to re-introduce his bill banning racial discrimination in federal hiring, promotions, and contracts early in the 105th Congress. Judiciary Committee Chairman henry Hyde is willing to give the legislation an airing in his committee, which would probably pass it in one form or another. The outstanding question is whether the House leadership will get behind the bill and allow a vote on the House floor. memories of last year, when leadership not only sat on the Canady bill but countenanced the reauthorization of federal programs shot through with quotas and set-asides, are not encouraging. Since then, of course, California voters dramatically demonstrated their opposition to state-sponsored discrimination. When will Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey?

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Moderate Republicans, as everyone knows, are trying hard to pull their party back to mainstream America. So what's their top priority this year? According to John McCaslin in the Washington Times, the congressmen in the ``Tuesday Lunch Brunch'' want to restore funds to the National Endowment for the Arts. Memo to the members: if crucifixes in urine represented mainstream America, there wouldn't have been a GOP majority in the first place.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Having had an attack of common sense when ``Ebonics'' first hit the news, the usual suspects are now engaged in revisionism. The Oakland school board wasn't really going to teach Ebonics; it wasn't really suggesting that Ebonics had a basis in black genes; it wasn't really trolling for federal cash from bilingual programs. Instead, the board was looking for a ``bridge'' between Ebonics and standard English, as teachers under the new dispensation would teach the latter, but not ridicule the former. Never mind that any fair reading of the board's original resolution makes it clear that it was doing exactly what it was accused of doing. And never mind the fact that bilingual education, as currently practiced, means teaching ``native'' languages, and not English. Ecen the mild, revisionist proposal makes no sense. In other periods of American history, waves of immigrants have learned English without teachers who were ``sensitive'' to their first language. The kids will get over being told they be doing something wrong. They won't get over being told they're doing something right when they aren't.

<LI>On Meet the Press, Anthony Lake, the Administration's nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, was asked whether he believed Alger Hiss was a spy. His answer: ``I've read a couple of books that certainly offered a lot of evidence that he may have been. I don't think it's conclusive.'' Report from the late CIA: ``The U.S.S. Maine -- Sunk, or Afloat? You be the judge.''

<LI>Texas GOP Chairman Tom Pauken is running better than expected in his bid to succeed Haley Barbour as chairman of the Republican National Committee. Pauken pledges to uproot the Washington-based consultants responsible for the party's ``poll-driven policy'' and to tend the grassroots. At a Washington press briefing, he appeared ready for the national spotlight, polished, sure-footed, and articulate. Neither of the leading candidates, ex-Gov. Steve Merrill of New Hampshire and RNC General Counsel David Norcross of New Jersey, has enough votes at present to win election at the January 17 meeting. Committee members fear that a Merrill chairmanship would be a full-employment program for the Dole campaign and that Norcross would represent Christine Todd Whitman's Northeast wing of the GOP. Pauken's prospects are hurt by the opposition of Barbour himself and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, but if he can put together a coalition with conservative competitors like Jim Nicholson of Colorado and Chuck Yob of Michigan, he has a shot -- and deserves to win.

<LI>Sen. Christopher Dodd, eight days before the elections, expressed his weariness with the campaign and said that in a week plus one day he could tell the truth ``again.'' We're following this story closely and will let you know when he does.

<LI>What could be more American? According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, at least 19 non-citizens voted in November's race between Rep. Bob Dornan (R., Calif.) and Loretta Sanchez, which Miss Sanchez won by less than 1,000 votes. The illegal voters were registered by the group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional (National Mexican Brotherhood), which registered roughly 1,300 people this year, nearly 600 of whom voted in the Dornan - Sanchez race. The Times found its 19 illegal voters out of a random sample of a mere 64 registered voters. How many more were there? No one knows. Small wonder a non-citizen feels comfortable voting in American elections: they are fast becoming as secure and reliable as those back home.

<LI>Mrs. Shucheng Huang, 55, had to look up the word ``strike'' when the United Auto Workers local called one at Abex Friction Products in April. But since then she has learned quite a bit about the real meaning of ``organized labor.'' When she continued to work, one of her car windows was broken. Two weeks later, a severed cow's head was left on her hood. A slingshot was used to smash her windshield while she was parking. Other workers had their tires slashed and windows broken, or awoke to find cattle heads in their yards. Someone shot at a window of Thomas Jones's house, and a message on the men's room wall at the plant said, ``Tom Jones, you're going to be dead before it's over with'' (quote courtesy of Tim Sullivan, Northern Virginia Daily). The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation has filed suit on behalf of ten workers who were targeted by the UAW's terror campaign. Such coercion is commonplace. What's especially scandalous is that under federal law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, union violence is legal if directed toward ``legitimate union objectives'' (U.S. v. Emmons, 1973). Abuses are inevitable under a regime of forced unionism. But if Congress is not yet ready to pass a National Right to Work Act, it should at least hold hearings on union thuggery and pass a Freedom from Violence Act removing union officials' status as a class above the law.
<P>

<LI>We have been asked to explain how Mr. Newt's problems differ from the Administration's. Easy. Mr. Newt is accused of an ethics violation, whereas Mr. Clinton's wife, friends, associates, fundraisers, business partners, Cabinet members, lawyers, White House staffers, political operatives, cronies, and ``Arkansas mafia'' are seldom accused of anything worse than felonies. Next.

<LI>Chinese Premier Li Peng paid a holiday visit to Moscow December 26 - 28, meeting with Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and setting the stage for an April summit in Moscow between Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Ever since Yeltsin's triumphal visit to Peking last spring, the relationship has blossomed into what both sides call a ``strategic partnership.'' The Chinese endorse Russian stands on Chechnya and NATO enlargement; the Russians return the favor by endorsing Chinese positions on human rights, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The Russians are selling SU-27 jet fighters and related production technology to China. Both sides condemn the notion that any superpower should dictate to other countries. (In case you wondered, that means us.) Meanwhile, the Clinton Administration proceeds on the assumption that Russia and China are our friends.

<LI>Slobodan Milosevic has tried hard to shut down B-92, Serbia's only non-government-controlled radio station. Newly independent media in Poland and the Czech Republic struggle for survival. Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, those working to plant democracy look to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to keep broadcasting the unfiltered truth -- as a check on unreconstructed Communists, as a standard for fledgling free media to emulate, and as a symbol of the West's support for their democratic future. Yet RFE/RL is embattled in Congress: budget cuts have eliminated its Hungarian service and threaten to curtail its Czech and Polish services. Serbo-Croatian broadcasting urgently needs to be expanded, but the money isn't there. All federal funding for RFE/RL is due to end in December 1999. This makes no  sense. Eastern Europeans -- and we -- need RFE/RL.

<LI>What do Shakespeare, Mozart, and Leonardo have in common? Each is a towering figure in European culture and each has been rejected as too controversial to appear on the new Euro currency. The Bard slammed Jews, Mozart puffed the Masons, Leonardo might have been homosexual. Despairing of famous Europeans, the European Monetary Institute has decreed that the new currency will feature architecture -- gateways, windows, bridges. Or, as one Euro-skeptic put it, ``It will remind people that a single currency is a gateway to mass unemployment, a window to misery, and a bridge to civil unrest.''

<LI>Sterling Burnett of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas has dug up a nice 1990 quote from Timothy Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, who is generally credited with giving U.S. foreign policy an increasingly Green hue: ``We've got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.'' It is interesting to know that the Administration's top Green doesn't really care whether the theory of global warming is correct. It's a good scare, and that's enough.

<LI>Maryland (which never seceded from the Union) allowed the Sons of Confederate Veterans to buy specialty license plates showing the Stars and Bars -- until black and liberal politicians objected. South Carolina properly removed the Confederate battle flag from its Capitol dome, where it implicitly claimed the respect of all South Carolinians, and where it recalled the state's open support of slavery 136 years ago. But a specialty license plate allows individuals to honor the memory of other individuals, whose actions were often gallant, and whose motives were mixed. Robert E. Lee had freed his slaves. Some Confederate soldiers were ex-slaves. It is peculiarly modern to despise losers. The ultimate losers are ourselves.

<LI>An editing error in our recent editorial ``The Deep Green Sea'' [Dec. 23] may have misled readers to assume that fertilizing the southern oceans with iron could reverse, rather than slow, the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. But we remain encouraged by this development. Absent an economic means of putting the atmosphere into reverse, it's a good thing that scientists have located the brake pedal.

<LI>Even for liberalism in its late, decadent stage, it's a stretch to make a hero out of a racist, sexist scumbag like Larry Flynt, but the nation's opinion leaders are managing. Director Milos Forman has made a film, The People v. Larry Flynt, that portrays the Hustler publisher as a charming, witty man and a passionate defender of First Amendment freedoms. Forman makes Flynt lament not being able to have more children, though he abandoned five of them, one of whom accuses him of having sexually molested her. The film skips over the racist cartoons and the violent, degrading depictions of sex in the magazine. The only odious characters in the film are nuns, Jerry Falwell, and anyone else offended by Flynt's product. That The People v. Larry Flynt is being hailed as ``timely,'' ``important,'' and even ``patriotic'' art just marks another step in the American elite's slouch toward Gomorrah.

<LI>Sentences of the week, from a laudatory story in U.S. News & World Report on assisted suicide in the Netherlands: ``Contrary to law, some three-fifths of all Dutch cases of euthanasia go unreported. . . . 1 in 5 of the unreported cases involved the most vexing kind of euthanasia, death without a patient's consent.'' Vexing indeed. Some would call it dysthanasia. Or homicide.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>O</font> live as a religious believer in the terrestrial city is necessarily to experience divided loyalties. Short of the Kingdom of God, complete justice can never reign, and all temporal allegiances must be provisional. The modern American social order is sufficiently benevolent that we are usually only dimly aware of this tension. For the editors and contributors to a symposium in <I>First Things</I>, an increasingly influential conservative journal on religion and public life, however, recent judicial decisions have put the issue in stark relief.
<P>
The November symposium was entitled ``The End of Democracy?: The Judicial Usurpation of Politics.'' The symposiasts -- Robert Bork, Russell Hittinger, Hadley Arkes, Charles W. Colson, and Robert P. George -- condemned recent judicial activism, particularly regarding abortion, euthanasia, and homosexuality, as both procedurally undemocratic and substantively immoral or unjust. Hittinger, a professor at the University of Tulsa, argued that these decisions not only ``deny protection to the weak and vulnerable'' and ``systematically remove the legal and political ability of the people to redress the situation,'' but raise the invidious principles to the level of ``essential features of the constitutional order.'' Further, the Supreme Court has set itself against religious believers by nullifying laws allegedly motivated by religion or even the belief that ``there is an ethic and a morality which transcend human invention'' (Justice Antony Kennedy's words in <I>Romer</I> v. <I>Evans</I>).
<P>
While most conservative analyses of the courts stop at or before this point, <I>FT</I> also discussed possible responses to this ``usurpation.'' What troubled most of those who have since commented on the symposium was the editors' introductory statement that we may ``have reached or are reaching the point where conscientious citizens can no longer give moral assent to the existing regime.'' The very legitimacy of the ``regime,'' they argued, was in question, and those conscientious citizens might eventually -- perhaps soon -- have to consider civil disobedience or even ``morally justified revolution.'' This use of the word ``regime'' was confusing: some critics took ``regime'' to mean something illegitimate by definition, like ``junta.'' Further, did illegitimacy attach to the Federal Government itself, as some paramilitary groups suggest, or merely to the practice of judicial rule? This confusion caused many commentators to miss the conditionality of the editors' position: that ``we are witnessing the end of democracy'' and will have to consider lawbreaking <I>if</I> the courts are not restrained, by themselves or others.
<P>
Of the symposiasts, only Colson went as far as (if not further than) <I>FT</I>'s editors. Writing that ``a showdown between church and state'' -- for which believers should prepare but not hope  -- ``may be inevitable,'' Colson surveyed the key Christian texts on the limits of political obligation, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s <I>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</I>. His conclusion: ``I have begun to believe that . . . we are fast approaching [the] point'' at which ``a believer must resist'' the government. Such resistance would, in the first instance, take the form of <I>persuasion</I>. ``Through her teaching and preaching office, the Church would need to expose the nature of the state's rebellion against God -- in effect, bringing the state under the transcendent judgment of God.'' If that failed, active disobedience would become necessary. The next step would be revolution, but ``this point, I believe, we have not yet reached.'' Unless that point is reached, religious conservatives must ``work relentlessly within the democratic process,'' and discussions of resistance should remain academic.
The others offered less drastic suggestions. Bork repeated his recent call for a constitutional amendment to allow the Congress to review court decisions by a majority vote or to eliminate the courts' power of constitutional review. He also suggested that elected officials not comply with unconstitutional Supreme Court decisions -- a position with a long history in American politics. Hittinger urged conservatives to treat issues like abortion as part of a ``broader constitutional crisis'' and, like Bork, advocated legislative remedies. If these measures did not work, he thought non-violent civil disobedience, presumably on the model of the civil-rights movement, would become necessary. 
<P>
Arkes, a professor at Amherst College and longtime <I>NR</I> contributor, offered no prescriptions. His distinct contribution was to focus attention on the implicit threat of the new judicial activism to people of orthodox faith, who he believes could find themselves excluded from the academy and the professions as the principle behind <I>Romer</I> -- that traditional moral views on homosexuality are tantamount to bigotry -- unfolds to the limits of its logic. Lastly, George, a professor of politics at Princeton University, labeled the current situation a ``crisis'' and ``a failure of American democ- racy.'' He called for ``conscientious objection,'' as when physicians in U.S. military hospitals refuse to perform abortions. He concludes that citizens must ask ``whether our regime is becoming the democratic 'tyrant state' about which [the Pope] warns.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he</font> reaction to the symposium was as sharp as it was swift. Leading neoconservatives Gertrude Himmelfarb, Walter Berns, and Peter Berger resigned their affiliations with <I>FT</I>. Bork wrote a letter disavowing any doubts about ``the legitimacy of the entire American 'regime''' (his article used the term ``illegitimacy'' only in connection with the Court's usurpations). <I>NR</I> [``First Things First,'' Nov. 11] also editorially criticized the suggestion that the regime was illegitimate. Norman Podhoretz, among others, detected in the symposium a whiff of the anti-American radicalism that had made the New Left so noisome in the Sixties. In the <I>Weekly Standard</I>, David Brooks relayed many of these charges and added two more: 1) that the symposiasts' fealty to abstract principle cut against the Oakeshottian ``Temper'' he took to be essential to conservatism, and 2) that their pessimism was neither warranted nor likely to serve conservatism's political prospects.
<P>
In her resignation letter, Miss Himmelfarb had issued her own tactical warning: <I>FT</I>'s ``irresponsible'' conduct would make it easier to portray ``any attempt by conservatives to introduce moral and religious considerations into 'the public square''' as dangerous. Liberals promptly sank to the challenge. Garry Wills, attentive to nuance as ever, claimed in a <I>New York Times</I> op-ed that the symposiasts ``made arguments indistinguishable from those advanced by the militias.'' (Evidently Mr. Wills knows militias that cite classical philosophers and papal encyclicals and worry more about assisted suicide than gun control.) It was probably inevitable that some journalist would take the caricature a step further.
<P>
Which brings us to Jacob Heilbrunn. According to ``Neocon v. Theocon,'' his cover story in <I>The New Republic</I>, <I>FT</I> brought into the open ``a full-fledged war between two leading groups of conservative intellectuals.'' In one corner are ``the mostly Jewish neoconservatives,'' followers of political theorist Leo Strauss, who believe that ``America was founded on an idea -- a commitment to the rights of man embodied in the Declaration of Independence.'' The ``theocons,'' on the other hand, are<P>
<blockquote><small> mostly Catholic intellectuals who are attempting to construct a Christian theory of politics that directly threatens the entire neoconservative philosophy. This attempt, in the eyes of at least some of the neocons, also directly threatens Jews. . . . The theocons, too, argue that America is rooted in an idea, but they believe that idea is Christianity. In their view, the United States is first and foremost a Christian nation, governed ultimately by natural law.</small>
</blockquote>
<P>

Heilbrunn describes the theocons as ``Thomists, would-be prophets of a new Age of Aquinas.'' Their ``founding father'' is the theologian Germain Grisez, their public face that of Alan Keyes.
<P>
Heilbrunn's <I>New Republic</I> article is directed not so much against the ``theocons'' as against the neocons. Michael Lind, Heilbrunn's sometime collaborator, has cast crafty neoconservative Jews as having opportunistically ascended to the intellectual leadership of a conservative movement whose rank-and-file is made up of anti-Semitic evangelical Christians. Heilbrunn's article is perhaps best seen as the second installment of this ``sellout of the neoconservative Jews'' thesis: now they've opportunistically allied themselves with even craftier anti-Semitic Catholics.
<P>
It's a well-constructed story line: gripping, coherent -- and entirely fictional. The <I>First Things</I> symposiasts included two Catholics (Hittinger and George), true, but also two Protestants (Bork and Colson), and one Jew (Arkes). Heilbrunn doesn't mention that Bork is not a Catholic, but takes note of ``his staunchly Catholic wife.'' (George's staunchly Jewish wife doesn't make an appearance.) The editors responsible for the introduction to the symposium included one Catholic (editor-in-chief Fr. Richard John Neuhaus), one Lutheran (editor James Nuechterlein), and one Jew (managing editor Matthew Berke).
<P>
A more central flaw in Heilbrunn's story is his utter (and at times laughable) incomprehension of Thomist natural-law theory, which is a branch of philosophy and not of theology. Indeed, it reminds me of the classic academic put-down to empty arguments: ``That's not right; it's not even wrong.'' 
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font<font size=+1>DHERENTS</font> of natural law believe that moral truths can be discovered through reason alone. As Prof. George puts it, ``What people like me are arguing is that the standard of public policy should be what reason can understand. So a view should stand or fall based on its reasonableness. Biblical tradition can be the carrier of wisdom on matters like same-sex marriage, as can the Talmud. But we don't appeal to the authority of the Bible or of the Catholic Church in making our case. We appeal to principles of rationality that are available to all people.'' So, for instance, when George and John Finnis of Oxford University testified in <I>Romer</I> -- an incident Heilbrunn records -- not once did they invoke the Bible or any authority other than reason itself; their reasoning was available to, and arguable by, non-believers. Indeed, natural law's Protestant critics have disparaged it precisely for its reliance on human reason in matters of moral consequence. If Thomism were merely a stalking horse for a ``Christian nation,'' then people like David Novak -- a rabbi who is also a natural-law theorist, student of Grisez, and member of <I>FT</I>'s editorial board -- shouldn't exist.
<P>
Similarly, Heilbrunn's account of the conservative ``battle over the identity of the American nation'' doesn't even rise to the level of being wrong. If there is a distinctively conservative theory of American nationhood, it isn't any sort of ``idea nation'' thesis, let alone a ``Christian nation'' idea, but rather the culturalist view of nationhood adumbrated by <I>NR</I> and in particular by John O'Sullivan (a Catholic, for those keeping score). Heilbrunn provides no evidence for his claim that the ``Christian nation'' thesis is central to ``American Catholic conservatism,'' because there isn't any. Perhaps R. J. Rushdoony or John Lofton believes in religious tests for office, but no prominent mainstream conservative intellectual does. <I>NR</I>'s David Klinghoffer, in some of his writings, seems to endorse the view that divine law should sometimes be imposed on non-believers; I can't think of a contemporary conservative Christian intellectual who agrees. Fr. Neuhaus and Prof. George both subscribe to the ``neoconservative'' view that the principles of the Declaration of Independence constitute American nationhood. It is Heilbrunn who can't make up his mind about the Declaration. Judge Bork and the theocons are damned for rejecting it, Alan Keyes for embracing it too closely. (It does, after all, speak of people being ``endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.'')
<P>
The attempt to cast Germain Grisez as the <I>eminence grisez</I> of the Catholic conspiracy against democracy is singularly inappropriate, since Grisez isn't primarily a political theorist and indeed did not hear of the <I>FT</I> symposium until after publication. Moreover, Grisez, George, and Finnis (who believe moral truths can be derived from self-evident first premises) are heterodox among Thomists (most of whom think moral truth can be derived from human nature). Prof. Hittinger wrote an entire book, <I>A Critique of the New Natural Law Theory</I>, rebutting Grisez.
<P>
And Fr. Neuhaus belongs to neither camp. As one might expect of a convert from Lutheranism, he's drawn more to Augustine than to Aquinas. Meanwhile, Alan Keyes, the supposed champion of the Catholics who are supposedly at odds with Jewish Straussian neocons, is a Straussian -- and one who devoted a pre-primary speech in New Hampshire to blasting the idea of a ``Christian nation.'' Finally, Norman Podhoretz -- who is surely a neocon if the term means anything any more -- is no Straussian. Heilbrunn's map of the Right just doesn't do justice to the intellectual geography he tries to cover. It's rather like those early maps of Africa that, though topographically unreliable, confidently declared: ``There be lions here.''
<P>
Heilbrunn's journalistic malpractice extends to his use of quotation and paraphrase. He describes Miss Himmelfarb's letter as having ``warned that Catholics threatened to undermine the very thing they claimed to want, the ordering of American society according to Judaeo-Christian ethics.'' In fact, her letter said <I>nothing</I> about Catholics; Heilbrunn was putting words in her mouth to make it seem that she accepted his Jews-v.-Catholics framework. He deploys his shoddiest tactic, however, on Prof. George. In his <I>FT</I> essay, George wrote that the ``doctrine of the necessary conformity of civil law to moral truth long predates the rise of modern democracy. It is present in both Plato and Aristotle, and was given careful, systematic expression by St. Thomas Aquinas. It has been a central feature of the tradition of papal social teaching.'' George's reference to Plato and Aristotle is inconvenient to Heilbrunn's argument that Catholic ``theocons'' are trying to impose their religious views on the nation. So he simply uses ellipses to eliminate it. (In his article, the second sentence of the passage reads, ``It . . . was given careful'' etc.) Heilbrunn also chooses not to quote George's comment a few paragraphs later: ``These are no mere sectarian teachings. Belief that laws and the regimes that make and enforce them must be evaluated by reference to universal standards of justice is shared by people of different faiths and of no particular faith.''
<P>
Heilbrunn's cascading confusions would matter little (except to those whose views he distorted) were they not coupled with astonishingly reckless charges. Take the claim, quoted above, that the so-called ``theocon'' enterprise ``in the eyes of at least some of the neocons, also directly threatens Jews.'' No on-the-record or even off-the-record quotes are provided for that incendiary remark; nor is any argument for the plausibility of the underlying claim.
<P>
Toward the end of his article Heilbrunn casually slanders Thomists, about whom he demonstrably knows nothing, as ``not so much anti-American as un-American.'' Insinuations of Catholic disloyalty to America, reckless charges of Catholic anti-Semitism, slanderous portrayals of Catholic elites plotting to build a theocracy: Heilbrunn traffics in the most cliched forms of anti-Catholic bigotry. Perhaps he should have entitled his article <I>Protocols of the Elders of Rome</I>.
<P>
Presumably almost all conservatives, and other people of good will, will reject <I>TNR</I>'s attempt to drive a wedge between Catholics and Jews. But that is not to deny that the <i>FT</I> controversy has revealed real intra-conservative divisions. One of these divisions has less to do with Leo Strauss or Thomas Aquinas than with Thomas Hobbes, the early modern theorist of absolute sovereignty. The Hobbesian streak among conservative critics of the symposium was most evident in <I>NR</I>'s editorial, which argued, ``Our general obligation to obey the laws rests upon the fact that the laws protect us (against our fellow man), not upon the ultimate justice of the government's founding, still less (fortunately) upon its general moral character.'' Whatever else might be said of this view, it does seem at the very least in tension with the principles and spirit of the American Revolution, in particular with the principle of majority consent.
<P>
But the influence of Hobbesianism can also be detected in the insistence of many conservatives that the ``legitimacy'' of a political status quo should not be the subject of sustained public argument. To be sure, not every proposition is worth discussing. But once one has been raised, to say that it should not be discussed is self-defeating. More importantly, as <I>FT</I> has noted, the Supreme Court has itself raised the question of the legitimacy of the law. As Notre Dame Law Professor Gerard Bradley observes in his brilliant essay ``Shall We Ratify the New Constitution?'' recent Supreme Court decisions (most notably <I>Casey</I> and <I>Lee</I>) can reasonably be construed as asking the American people ``to ratify and thereby legitimate'' a constitution of the Court's devising. In that light, the <I>First Things</I> symposium was simply a resounding, ``No!''

The editors' reference to Nazi Germany -- which outraged many of the critics -- is a dicier issue. Quoting the papal encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> on the general point that a law's binding force on the conscience depends on its morality, they noted that the footnotes in the encyclical refer to earlier papal statements that specifically condemned Nazi crimes. The editors add, ``America is not and, please God, will never become Nazi Germany, but it is only blind hubris that denies it can happen here and, in peculiarly American ways, may be happening here.'' The passage, in other words, was intended as an antidote to an uncritical version of American exceptionalism that denies the possibility that human rights could ever be tyrannically violated here. Whether or not the argument was tactfully made, it ought to be openly debatable.
<P>
For many of the neoconservative critics of the symposium, the anti-American rhetoric of the 1960s was a formative, and traumatic, political experience. But the parallel is weak, the result of analyzing arguments formally rather than materially. Quips Bradley, ``Except for the hair, Hadley Arkes doesn't have much in common with Abbie Hoffman. Nor is Jerry Rubin the same as Dietrich Bonhoeffer.'' Or as Fr. Neuhaus puts it, ``There is nothing so elementary as that there are criteria for just and unjust government. It astonishes me that people think that we came up with something new or something retrieved from the ash heap of the Sixties.'' 
<P>
A very mild anti-American strain does indeed exist on the Right -- think of the number of conservatives who interpreted President Clinton's re-election as a verdict on the intellect or morality of the American public -- but conservatives remain more likely to make the opposite mistake of uncritically embracing populism. I'll get worried about anti-Americanism on the Right when I see Neuhaus burning a flag.
<P>
If anything, the symposium could be faulted for laying insufficient stress on the <I>permanent</I> nature of the tension between the demands of God and those of Caesar. Putting the symposium in such a context would have raised the needed alarms without being alarmist. It might then have reminded conservatives that liberty requires eternal vigilance -- without apocalyptic rhetoric. 
<P>
Meanwhile, if the Right is repeating an error of the late Sixties Left, perhaps it's factionalism: a tendency for intellectuals to get caught up in theoretical disputes while ignoring points of concordance that have far more practical relevance. Almost all conservatives agree that the federal judiciary has needlessly and destructively intervened in the nation's social and moral controversies (most recently when it blocked implementation of the California Civil Rights Initiative). Almost all conservatives agree that it's important to address the problem. If this debate concentrates the conservative mind on a program to rein in the courts and a strategy to advance that program -- if it makes efforts to curtail judicial review respectable -- all conservatives would have reason to cheer. Some conservatives may balk at delegitimizing the courts, but an aggressive campaign to <I>demystify</I> them is long overdue. Justice Scalia's recent dissents offer a model of how to do this.
<P>
<I>First Things</I> may also have performed another public service. After more than 16 years of sitting in the back of the Republican bus, social conservatives are getting restive. Already, important players like Gary Bauer and Phyllis Schlafly are taking shots at Ralph Reed's accommodationism and moving into Pat Buchanan's orbit -- which is to say, out of their alliance with the rest of the Right. Something good will have come of this debate if conservative intellectuals are awakened to grassroots discontent with the party's handling of moral issues, most importantly abortion. If the conservative coalition is to be kept together, that sentiment is going to have to be responsibly accommodated.

<H2>Remembering Mozart</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 20<br>


Events crowd around, and the journalist/commentator is especially aware of imminent developments. Will the hostages survive? Will Bill Clinton resign? Between this deadline and the appearance of these words, reflections on minute-by-minute crises run the risk of appearing rancid, or insensitive, or outside any general concern.
<P>
At home, before the deadline, we tuned in to A&E for its daily biography and got -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart! That roaring genius! And so my mind went back to my one very direct touch with Mozart.
<P>
It was some years ago, and the club I go to for a few days every summer imposed on me, as is its habit in its dealings with amateurs, a challenge. Would I perform on the harpsichord a stretch of music by Mozart?
<P>
One is conditioned to say yes, in such circumstances, the governing muse being: Everybody has to do his (not her) bit in order to fly the banner of amateur art.
<P>
I selected to conquer Mozart's 12 variations on the theme of ``<I>Ah, vous dirais-je, Maman</I>.'' That was one of the musical trifles Mozart brought off in his 21st year, taking a few hours off between operas, concertos, and symphonies. The English version of the French tune is ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'': Tum tum TUM TUM tum tum TAH, Tum tum tum tum what you are.
<P>
Mozart lovers can imagine him, perhaps on his 21st birthday, in a crowded salon:<P>
``Wolfgang, give us a tune!'' Wolfgang: ``On what theme?''<P>
``Oh, how about . . . 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'?''<P>
So he has another drink and then sits down at the keyboard and thrums out the theme. But Mozart being Mozart, he then improvises a variation on it. The crowd is delighted. ``Wait!'' he says. ``I've just started!'' He goes on to a second variation. And on and on, finishing with a 12th.<P>
The young crowd is ecstatic over the variations, which go from playful to solemn, from grand to sleepy, from sweet and simple to a crashing finale. More drinks are served and other things occupy the company, but the next morning an admirer says, ``Wolfgang, you really ought to write down what you did last night.''<P>
Two hundred years later I am slaving away, trying to stuff his extemporaneity into my fingers, spending more time in the effort than Mozart would have taken to write five symphonies and four operas.<P>
The dreadful moment approached, and there were 1,500 happy people there, warmed up by a dozen episodes preceding my nervous ordeal: rousing comedy sequences, songs, jokes, laughter. During that period I was backstage, struggling to keep my fingers warm and my heart stable.<P>
I had read that the great Glenn Gould nurtured his fingers before concert time by immersing them in bowls of warm water. I asked, imperially, for the same treatment, and a high official of a major U.S. corporation, doing his service to the muse, was designated to keep me supplied with warm water during the agonizing hour awaiting my tribulation.<P>
I could hear, through the heavy curtains, the roars of delight from the audience. The awful moment arrived when the master of ceremonies announced, ``And now we will have something really unusual! Our camp mate will perform on the harpsichord [the what? -- I could almost hear the crowd wondering] Mozart's 12 variations on the theme, 'Ah, vous dirais-je, Maman,'' which, folks, translates into English as, 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star.'''<P>
The stage wheeled around, and suddenly I was front and center, and the temperature dropped from 80 degrees backstage to 50 degrees in the California redwood country. My limpid warmed fingers turned to ice. I started in. ``Tum tum TUM TUM tum tum TUM, How I wonder what you are.''<P>
I hit as many false as correct notes, and was sustained only by the hope that the mistakes did not affront a permissive audience, most of whom had not heard a harpsichord before, many of whom patiently assumed that Variation Two would feature a kangaroo jumping out of the instrument and everyone would roar in amusement, and they could go on to the next act.<P>
You know about the speaker who goes on and on? Adlai Stevenson once quipped, ``What happens after a Saturday-night speech by Hubert Humphrey? Sunday.'' Mozart's 12 variations take a certain amount of time to get through. A lot of time, by the measurements of hyped-up audiences who are treated to a joke or a jazz exuberance every minute or two. A few months before my ordeal, the people of California had voted yes on the famous Proposition 13, which would require the legislature to limit taxation on property. ``Vote Yes on Proposition 13'' was the great rallying point of the political season. After about five minutes of tortured effort, with another five minutes to go, a voice rose from the crowd, ``Vote no on Variation 13!''<P>
Aaahh. A huge squirt of ice water in mid-performance. But I got through it, and the crowd was very kind, and I thought then, as I did after listening to A&E, how wonderful was Mozart, and how many, underendowed, have suffered from attempting to imitate him.

A few years ago, you asked me to help you out with your research in the Brazilian rainforest, and, as you'll remember, I said, ``Sure, no problem.''
<br>
So I cut you a check for my donation, and then I asked if maybe it would be possible to use some of the findings of your research in my soon-to-be-bestselling book, <U>Earth in the Balance</U>.
<br>
Now what I need to know is a) whether the check I wrote to you was a personal check; b) whether it was (more likely) a check drawn on the foundation I created with the money I had left over in my senatorial campaign war chest; and c) if it had ``for research'' in the memo section.<br>
I also need to know whether you and your research organization are a 501(c)(1), 501(c)(2), 501(c)(3), or 501(c)(4) corporation. <br>
I need all this pretty fast, by the way. At least by Sunday-morning talk-show hour.<br>
See, this thing with Gingrich is kind of unsettling. Don't get me wrong: I'm all for trying to undermine the guy. But I'm sure there's a more . . . how do I put this? . . . a more surgical way to get him.<br>
I wasn't really worried about it until Dad called. ``Gleetings, my number one son. How many Chinese businessmen have been in today?'' he said.<br>
``Cut it out, Dad,'' I groaned.<br>
``C'mon, Al! What'd they serve at lunch today in the mess? Moo Shu Pork? General Tsing Spicy Scallop?''<br>
``Dad, I'm hanging up the phone.''<br>
``It's a joke, boy! A joke! Lighten up!'' he cried. I could hear the ice rattle in his highball glass, which means he's finished his drink. Last week, I could hear the ice tinkling in a full glass, which meant I had to endure two whole verses of ``We Are Siamese if You Please,'' with Mom in the background banging a trash-can lid with a hammer, to simulate a gong.<br>
``Well it's not funny, Dad. In this first place, it's racially insensitive.''<br>
``Not as insensitive as fleecing those poor fellas to the tune of $300,000 for a five-minute White House sit-down and a doughnut.''<br>
``And we've given most of the money back.''<br>
Dad burst out laughing. ``I know! I read it in the paper! I mean, son, what are you running up there? A Chinese fire drill?''<br>
``Dad, I swear to God I'll hang up this phone.''<br>

``Simmer down, boy. You know, in my day, if we took three million dollars from a fellow, you'd better believe we'd keep it. Oh yes. And give him something for it, besides. Now I see you fellows on the news swearing up and down that all that money had absolutely no effect on policy. No effect on policy? Use your head, boy! Don't tell the customer that! If a man wants to pay three million dollars for a car, don't go on TV telling folks that it's okay, 'cause the car don't run. What are you, nuts?''<br>

``I'm not following your analogy,'' I said.<br>
``And then I read about this Gingrich character, and how he's in trouble because he used money from the wrong account to pay for a college course he was teaching. A college course! He didn't steal the money, or buy himself a Cadillac, or send his girlfriend to Hawaii. No. He taught a college course.''<br>
``Dad, I have to go.''<br>
``How do you trust a man like that? How can you trust a man who doesn't take a little for himself?''<br>
``Dad, I'm late for a meeting.''<br>
``Well, you just watch out. You guys in D.C. have so many tax laws and ethics investigations you've turned everyone into a crook.''<br>
``Bye, Dad.'' And I hung up. But Dad's point is well taken: I've got to start cleaning up some loose ends before the '00 campaign starts in earnest.<br>
I called up David Bonior. He's spearheading the battle against Newt, so I figured that he's an expert.<br>
``Hmmmm,'' he said, after I had laid out the situation. ``This doesn't look good!''<br>
``It doesn't? But isn't it, at most, just a technical mistake? A minor oversight?'' I asked.<br>
``Ooohhh no no no. This kind of malfeasance -- ''<br>
``Excuse me. Isn't malfeasance kind of strong?''<br>
``Call it what you will, sir. But it's a Gingrich-sized oversight. The good news, if you're interested, is that Dick Gephardt has some similar, though slightly more serious, problems.''<br>
``Well, I appreciate that, David, but I really think we've all gone too far with these rigidly picky ethics attacks for purely personal gain.''<br>
Bonior clucked his tongue. ``Spoken,'' he said, ``like someone who has some serious violations of the tax code to explain.''<br>
``Oh, come on, David,'' I said. ``Everyone has a few mistakes on the books.''<br>
``Not me,'' he said. ``See you in New Hampshire.''<br>
So, please, Rusty, hurry up with those receipts!

<b>Libertarianism Pro And Con</b><br>
Two reviews of Charles Murray's new book, <I>What It Means to Be a Libertarian: A Personal Interpretation</I>, appeared Monday, one by Michael Barone in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and one by Daniel Casse in the <I>Weekly Standard</I>. Both are thoughtful, incisive writers affiliated with the Right. Barone's review (also of David Boaz's <I>Libertarianism: A Primer</I>) is mostly positive, but raises the question of whether a libertarian polity can defend itself from attacks, both internal and external. A deep and searching question. Casse's review is more critical. It is also, we must say, uncharacteristically disappointing. Too much of Casse's critique of libertarianism is simply that it doesn't poll well. On Social Security and Medicare, he writes, "There is, as the last election proved, no demand to abandon them wholesale outside of libertarian intellectual circles." Americans like paternalism, he argues, citing recent welfare-reform efforts as an example. We'd quibble with that examplepublic pressure may have forced reform, but the power of the welfare bureaucracy and its allies influenced the direction those reforms have taken. But more to the point, the popularity of a program is not relevant to an inquiry into the truth of the philosophy from which that program derives. Casse accepts James Q. Wilson's dictum that government always gets "bigger, more complicated, more burdensome, and more costly." Murray, Casse argues, doesn't confront "this unavoidable truth about government. . . . The sheer magnitude of the problems that government now fumbles with may militate against the voluntary and private solutions that worked during the early part of this country's history." Now in fact libertarians have devoted a lot of attention to this particular argument; a refutation of it is a focus of Richard Epstein's <I>Simple Rules for a Complex World</I> and a muted theme of the conclusion to <I>The Bell Curve</I> (which Murray wrote with the late Richard Herrnstein). Indeed, Barone's review quotes Boaz making the counter-arguments: that increased social complexity makes attempts at government control more and more futile; that complex systemsecological, economic, socialcan be self-ordering. The <I>Weekly Standard</I> seems to have an anti-libertarian streak. We look forward to the day it publishes a cogent critique of libertarian political philosophy. (For an example of one, see Robert P. George's essay in <I>National Review</I>'s 40th anniversary issue.)

<b>Cheap Shot</b><br>
In recent weeks, both Robert Novak and the American Conservative Union, led by David Keene, have referred to Laura Ingraham as an "alleged" conservative because she has questioned whether Rep. Dan Burton is the right man to lead the House investigation into Whitewater and related matters. This is childish. Whether or not Ingraham was correctand she is hardly alone in having reservations about Burton's judgmenther conservative credentials are impeccable. One could just as fairly, and just as foolishly, excommunicate Mr. Novak (for his Perotista views on campaign-finance reform) or Mr. Keene (for his years of subservience to Bob Dole).

	"An outdoor display by the Penn State art department included a statue of the Virgin Mary resting within what appeared to be a grotto setting but which was actually female genitalia complete with surrounding pubic hair and emanating blood. When a priest from the Catholic campus ministry complained about this kitsch he was told the work was intended to bring attention to 'oppressed women in the church.' The 'artist' proved unable to explain what the placing of  a statue of Mary in this venue had to do with the oppression of women. While giving its blessing to what feminists celebrate as vaginal art, Penn State discourages nativity scenes as being contrary to the spirit of multiculturalism."

<FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><font size=+1>aving</font> written off Bill Clinton for most of 1995, Republicans are now tempted to ascribe supernatural powers of persuasion to him. Neither attitude encourages constructive thought on how to counter his strategy. But despite the image of an Administration adrift, President Clinton has arrived, through a mixture of accident and design, at a strategy for Democrats to survive and perhaps even prosper in ideologically uncongenial times. While there may not be a Clintonian ideology, it is possible to speak of a Clintonian style of politics.
<P>
Its most important feature has been the attempted retooling of the Democratic Party as the servant of middle-class interests through the mechanism of government. Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg explained the reasoning in a much-noted essay in the Fall 1991 <I>American Prospect</I>: ``Democrats need to rediscover broad-based social policy that sends a larger message: Democrats are for 'everybody,' not just the 'have-nots.' That means defending and enlarging social insurance initiatives that reach the lower and middle classes rather than constructing safety nets that protect only the poor.'' Means-tested programs stigmatize recipients and are, Greenberg thinks, easy to cut; middle-class entitlements are forever.
<P>
National health insurance, a longstanding goal of the Left, was thus also a means of expanding the Democratic voter base and creating a permanent Democratic majority. It would do to the middle class what Social Security had done to the elderly: make a majority of them beholden to the Federal Government and its political champions, in this case for their very lives. As Grace-Marie Arnett points out, the Clintons have pursued this objective with essentially Fabian tactics. They have tried to establish beachheads within the health-care market from which to launch new government interventions. The Clintons' 1993 - 94 health-care ``reform'' effort would have been a large, and probably irreversible, step toward socialized medicine. Time is already beginning to obscure just how close they came.
<P>
Clinton's repeated proposals to expand subsidies for higher education are a smaller-scale version of the same entitlement strategy. The government will now step forward to finance increased access to the very sectors of the economy the government has most inflated. It's a proposal well crafted to help Clinton make inroads among traditional GOP strongholds in the middle class and even upper middle class. The Republican Congress has forced Clinton to spend more time playing defense: instead of increasing public dependence on government, he has been vigilantly blocking cuts in government programs that benefit people who work. Clinton's massive expansion of the earned income tax credit, and subsequent determination to protect that expansion from Republican budget-cutters, is a case in point.
<P>
Even on welfare, where President Clinton has felt it necessary to appear responsive to middle-class demands for reform and retrenchment, he has assiduously avoided policies that would reduce the scope and power of government or its allied institutions in liberaldom. Indeed, as Robert Rector observes, Clinton originally sought window-dressing reforms that would actually increase the power of the welfare establishment.
<P>
After the Republicans took Congress, he moved toward a liberal version of welfare reform, which, geared as it is toward processing people through welfare rather than keeping them off it, creates opportunities for expanding state services: child-care subsidies, job training, transportation assistance, child-support enforcement. Clinton has followed a similar pattern on education: he has a long history of supporting the least reform the public demands and the most the education establishment will tolerate. So, for instance, he's all in favor of charter schools, as long as they don't escape the burden of federal regulations or threaten the power of teachers' unions.
<P>
To woo the middle class, Clinton has also had to tack center-right on ``values.'' Greenberg readily acknowledged the point in his 1991 essay: ``Democrats cannot win over the average family,'' he wrote, ``unless there are some limits on the party's moral agnosticism.'' Clinton's cultural rhetoric is now to the right of George Bush's. We know that President Clinton read Ben Wattenberg's <I>Values Matter Most</I>, and he has talked incessantly about ``values'' ever since. (The popularity of that word ought, incidentally, to depress conservatives. ``'Values' beat 'virtues' eleven to nothing in a focus group we did,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's amazing Bill Bennett sold any books.'')
<P>
On social and cultural issues, Clinton has used the bully pulpit quite effectively to signal that he shares the public's values. And if, when Clinton says that he supports introducing school uniforms or firing incompetent teachers, some people are misled to believe that he has some policy initiative to translate the rhetoric into reality, well, that's no skin off his back. He has struck a particularly tough pose on crime, though, as David Kopel observes, there is much less to his record than meets the eye. Clinton's gauzy communitarian rhetoric is also deployed on fiscal issues. During last fall's budget showdown, he was constantly claiming to be defending ``our values'' from Republicans intent on taking medicine away from the elderly and protection from the environment. This kind of values-laden talk is probably necessary for parties of the Center - Left for the foreseeable future. (Tony Blair, leader of Britain's Labour Party, does it too.)
<P>
In addition to pulling more middle-class voters into the Democratic coalition, President Clinton also wanted to co-opt parts of American business. In some respects, ClintonCare was a failed attempt to do so: it offered major financial benefits to large manufacturers and insurers. The Administration's support for high-tech subsidies was a play for Silicon Valley. The re-orientation of American trade policy toward bilateral deals, sometimes company-specific, enabled the Administration to dispense favors to exporters at its discretion. And the ultimate logic of the ``corporate responsibility'' themes many Democrats are pushing is to transform American businesses into docile servants of the welfare state.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N HIS</font> zeal to expand his base, Clinton has not forgotten more reliable Democratic constituencies. So federal funding of labor unions has increased (and it has been made easier for them to use compulsory dues on political activity). The Violence Against Women Act has funneled money to feminist organizations, and ``AIDS education'' programs to the gay Left. The 1993 ``stimulus'' bill was a payback to big-city mayors; when it failed, much of its substance was included in the next year's crime bill. Restrictions on the politicization of the federal work force have been loosened considerably.
<P>
Clinton's sheer political talent should not be underestimated as a factor in the success of this strategy. Nor, for that matter, should the frequency and facility of his lies. He is able to call high-mindedly for bipartisan statesmanship and then, in the next breath, launch a furious attack on the motives of his opponents -- who, we are to believe, <I>want</I> children to drink dirty water, eat diseased meat, and smoke. Yet Clinton is simultaneously a soothing figure. He is able to appeal to that strain of public sentiment that wants the noise and bickering from Washington to stop. His rhetoric is also appealing because it tells the voters they can have it all: a balanced budget without cutting entitlements; environmental regulation without economic costs; welfare reform without anyone suffering. He's the perfect practitioner of the politics of painlessness: for everything that's good, against everything bad. (In fairness, some Republicans, particularly of the Gingrich - Kemp brand, are prone to this as well.)
<P>
Another reason for Clintonism's success is that, as many commentators have noted, this White House focuses on its political health to an unprecedented degree. American foreign policy toward Ireland and Haiti has been driven largely by domestic political considerations. The church-burning issue was basically a whipped-up hysteria designed to persuade black voters that white racism is still the chief threat to their well-being. And the Administration skillfully orchestrates the appearance of a constant flurry of activity -- no matter how microscopic the initiative or gesture, how inadequate the rapid response. The Administration provides motion without progress, a perpetual campaign. President Clinton hasn't declared for re-election; would anyone notice if he did?
<P>
The chief vulnerability of Clintonism is that even the boldest New Democrat cannot afford to cross some constituencies that are out of sync with the public. Clinton can't sign legal reform because of the trial lawyers. He was willing to anger organized labor over NAFTA, but he has done its bidding on striker replacement and other workplace issues; if the Democrats do well this November, they will be greatly indebted to the AFL-CIO's vigorous campaign on their behalf. And Clinton would not have dared to sign the bill banning partial-birth abortions for fear of incurring the wrath of feminists, a calculation that highlights the vacuum where Clintonism's moral core should be. But the issue that most devastatingly gives the lie to Clinton's pretensions of conservatism -- his support of race and gender preferences -- appears to have been dropped by his opposition.
<P>
The consolation for conservatives is that Clinton doesn't move the debate; he merely positions himself within it. In the first year of the Administration, William Kristol compared the condition of American liberalism to that of Soviet Communism in the late 1970s: both were seemingly dominant, both utterly hollow. For a time it was fashionable in conservative circles to describe health-care reform as liberalism's Afghanistan, the fatal overreach that would precipitate the empire's collapse. Yet in neither case has the old order been unequivocally defeated.
<P>
Now, writes Johnathan Sunley in the summer <I>National Interest</I>, ``Communism as a dogma is dead. . . . The problem facing supposedly 'post-Communist' societies is not a revival of that ideology, but the survival of power structures that escaped the 'revolutions' of 1989 more or less unscathed.'' Just so with contemporary liberalism and the ``revolution'' of 1994. If Bill Clinton wins re-election, his legacy could be that America enters the twenty-first century shackled by the institutional residua of an ideology almost nobody any longer believes.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> pledge to ``end welfare as we know it'' was the centerpiece of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Voters were blitzed with TV ads promising to put welfare recipients to work and proposing an apparent two-year time limit on receipt of benefits. But on no topic has the Clintonian chasm between word and deed been broader than on welfare.
<P>
Americans have lived through many an ``end to welfare.'' In 1988, Congress passed the ``Family Support Act,'' a mammoth bipartisan reform that was promised ``to replace welfare with work.'' In reality, the bill required almost no one to work; AFDC caseloads ballooned by 30 per cent.
<P>
Nearly 90 per cent of voters still want welfare recipients to work for benefits. Their antipathy to the existing welfare system creates a real hurdle for liberal legislators seeking to preserve and expand it. Hence, even the most left-wing proposals now come well armored in conservative slogans. By the mid Eighties periodic sham reform had become welfare's life blood, assuaging public discontent while masking the growth of the system.
<P>
Initially, it seemed Clinton might break this pattern. In his first month in office, he repeated his promise to end welfare and to make recipients work. In addition, in a speech before the National Governors' Association, he promised to encourage state welfare experimentation through waivers. Critically, he proposed to ``approve waivers that I did not necessarily agree with . . . the nature of the experiment is that one person has an idea different from another person.''
<P>
Reality quickly began to jostle the political rhetoric. President Clinton appointed, as head of HHS, Donna Shalala, who had served with Mrs. Clinton on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, an organization that had opposed even the token reforms of 1988. Charged with implementing Mr. Clinton's key campaign pledge to end welfare, Miss Shalala gave only a single grudging sentence to the topic in her confirmation testimony. Senator Moynihan felt compelled to upbraid her for her indifference.
<P>
Conservatives willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt on welfare, including this author, had their illusions dispelled abruptly when the President unveiled his first budget. Work had disappeared from the agenda. Clinton had stated that the ``reform'' of 1988 had been well designed but had been crippled by a lack of funds for JOBS, the program that nominally enforced work requirements.
<P>
By Washington standards, JOBS was a dwarf program costing about $1 billion out of an annual welfare spending pot of $234 billion. Thus, if lack of money were really holding up reform, it would be easy to jump-start ``work, not welfare,'' by giving it more.
<P>
But Clinton's budget didn't add one thin dime to the work program. He did propose large increases in almost every other type of welfare spending. Proposed new spending initiatives in conventional welfare programs (food stamps, housing, Head Start, etc.) amounted, over five years, to $100 billion above the already explosive growth in baseline spending. Having, on the campaign trail, trumpeted ``ending welfare'' and making recipients work, Clinton in office did exactly the opposite: ignoring workfare while seeking to expand traditional welfare spending.
<P>
Bolder reversals followed. The 1988 reform, pathetic though it was, included some minute work requirements squeezed in, with great effort, by conservative legislators. Avoiding undue haste, the liberal Congress decreed that these work requirements were not to take effect until 1994 (six years after passage) and would affect only some two-parent families comprising 6 per cent of the AFDC rolls. These provisions were the first and only work requirements passed into law. The Clinton Administration quietly sought to abolish them, through a change hidden deep within the vast Omnibus Budget Act. This maneuver outraged even the <I>New York Times</I>, and the attempted repeal failed.
<P>
While retreating at full speed on the work issue, President Clinton did break decisive new ground on another, unexpected front. Although he had predictably attacked Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech on illegitimacy, Clinton reversed course once in office. He began to speak out against rising illegitimacy, warning that the collapse of marriage was a root cause of crime and other social problems. On television, he acknowledged that Charles Murray was right: welfare promoted out-of-wedlock births. In his first State of the Union address, Clinton warned that society was threatened by an illegitimate birth rate that would soon hit 50 per cent.
<P>
Of course, Clinton never intended actually to do anything about illegitimacy. But, often, a President's words do count. And no President, including Ronald Reagan, had ever spoken this way against illegitimacy. Like Nixon's trip to China, Clinton's speeches about marriage and illegitimacy permanently altered the national debate. An issue which many politicians had been afraid even to mention was now raised to prominence, even urgency. For this, the country owes Bill Clinton a profound debt of thanks.
<P>
In the realm of deed rather than word, however, the Clinton Administration continued to drift left. While still arguing that more funding was the key to reform, Clinton again failed in his second budget to provide more money for workfare thus ensuring that his campaign pledge to make welfare recipients work would not even begin to take effect until 1996, if at all. Finally, in the summer of 1994, Clinton unveiled his grand welfare-reform plan. Not surprisingly, it was a parody of liberal anti-reforms parading in conservative prose. It didn't require work, and effectively prohibited states from doing so. There was no ``two years and off'' rule. In its place was the following provision: no one would be required to work for the first two years on welfare; among those exceeding the two-year limit, some tiny portion would be required to do community-service work but only under restrictions that would make dependency reduction impossible.
<P>
Although 70 per cent of the AFDC caseload at any given time have been on welfare for over two years, the bill required only 7 per cent of the caseload to work by 1999. These welfare recipients would work only 15 hours per week and would receive an effective wage of $15 per hour (counting all benefits). The bill allocated $4,000 in administrative overhead for each workfare participant. At many job sites, recipients doing community-service work would become members of public-sector unions. The Clinton Administration had been truthful on one point: ``ending welfare as we know it'' in this manner would cost a lot more than the status quo. The real costs of the proposal were discreetly hidden, off budget, in future years.
<p>
On illegitimacy, the bill proposed the status quo and triumphantly called it reform. To obtain welfare, unwed mothers under age 18 would have to live with their parents. But 90 per cent of out-of-wedlock births occur to women over 18, and most young teen mothers already live with their parents. Moreover, it is quite likely that the teen's mother had once been an unmarried welfare mother herself, and was thus more a cause of the problem than its solution.
<p>
In attempting to conceal the policy vacuum on illegitimacy the Administration's press releases made bold proclamations about abstinence and teaching young people to delay sexual activity. But the bill itself mentioned neither marriage nor abstinence; instead it offered tired liberal nostrums: condom distribution, self-esteem building, values clarification, ``life skills training,'' etc. This was no surprise, since Donna Shalala abhorred abstinence education and had spent the prior year trying to abolish the government's single tiny abstinence program.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT> short, the 622-page ``end of welfare'' bill was nearly a carbon copy of the bogus reforms of 1988. It would have ``ended welfare'' by enlarging it.
<p>
For decades, the welfare state had rested uneasily on this sort of deception: the ability of liberal politicians to say one thing while doing another. As long as Democrats controlled Congress, Clinton could talk tough and still satisfy left-wing interest groups. Then came the 1994 election. After years of rhetorical philandering, Clinton suddenly faced a shotgun wedding with a Republican Congress eager to do the things Clinton only gabbed about. The House advanced legislation to establish work requirements and time limits, slow the automatic growth of welfare spending, reward states for cutting dependence, combat illegitimacy, and end the entitlement status of welfare. In the new political context, Clinton's bill was so liberal that Democrats never bothered to bring it to the floor of the House or Senate. Finally, the President himself disparaged his own legislation in an interview with Ben Wattenberg, a fitting end to a farce.
<p>
Clinton was now stretched in a three-way tug of war between his own rhetoric, the liberals who controlled most of his party and Administration, and the Republican Congress. The result was incoherence and a series of policy reversals, culminating, last winter, when Clinton supported the welfare-reform bill passed in the Senate and then vetoed virtually identical legislation a few weeks later, during the night of the record blizzard. After the veto, White House operatives sought to burnish the President's image as a reformer. Clinton, they claimed, had already fulfilled his pledge to end welfare by granting waivers to reform-minded governors (mostly Republican). Again the facts were otherwise: while Clinton had specifically promised to grant waivers for ideas he did not agree with, Secretary Shalala garrisoned HHS like Stalingrad; many conservative proposals were simply rejected, others greatly curtailed. Each conservative waiver had to be fought out clause by clause. California and Massachusetts simply rejected the modified waivers offered them.
<p>
The flip-flops continued. In May, in an effort to upstage Bob Dole, Clinton praised Governor Tommy Thompson's new reform plans, even though Wisconsin's initiative was several light years to the right of the legislation the President had vetoed four months earlier. Within 24 hours, White House spokesman Harold Ickes had indicated that the Administration had serious reservations about the Wisconsin waiver. Then came a reversal of the reversal, and another reversal, and so forth. But the substance of the debate continued to shift rightward. In July the White House backed the Castle - Tanner bill which ended the entitlement status of AFDC and copied many features of the legislation Clinton had vetoed in January. A lid was also put on the more extreme members of the Administration eager to prove ``scientifically'' that ending the entitlement status of welfare would yield millions of starving kids. Press spokesman Mike McCurry admitted that such studies (which had provided justification for the earlier veto) were sometimes ``a worthless exercise.''
<p>
At the end of July Congress passed a softened version of last year's legislation. Critically, Congress omitted Medicaid reforms to avoid a threatened veto. The President had apparently promised liberal groups he would ``save'' Medicaid; having kept his promise, he may have felt more free to reform AFDC, the least popular welfare program. After a debate within the White House, the President declared he would sign the bill. Although vacillating wildly on policy, Bill Clinton the politician has always grasped one simple idea: standing, sword in hand, as the final defender of the fortress of welfare is not a route to long-term popularity. And Bill Clinton does like to be liked.

 health-care plan proposed by the President and Mrs. Clinton demonstrated the scope of their project for socializing a major segment of the U.S. economy. In fact, Hillary Clinton revealed her statist philosophy during a speech in Washington in 1993 when she said, ``It's time to put the common good, the national interest, ahead of individuals.''
<P>
The liberal agenda wasn't just to make health care more affordable and accessible, but also to seduce the middle class into allegiance to the welfare state with a sweeping new entitlement. Fortunately, as Americans learned the details of the plan -- thanks to a network of fax machines, radio talk shows, the internet -- the majority of them saw through it.
<P>
The Clinton plan would have created at least 200 regional alliances, staffed by more than 50,000 bureaucrats, and added more than $70 billion to the federal budget deficit (according to the Congressional Budget Office's February 1994 estimate). The whole scheme would have been enforced with a plethora of fines, penalties, and jail terms for physicians and their patients. Voters registered their displeasure at the polls in November 1994.
<P>
The defeat of ClintonCare was a famous victory -- but an incomplete one. While Clinton-style health reform has receded into the shadows, no stake has been driven through its heart. During her visit to Estonia this July, the First Lady told reporters that government regulation of health care was needed and would happen eventually. Referring to the plan she had spearheaded two years earlier, she said, ``I think that basic model is still the right model.''
<P>
Ira Magaziner, the plan's principal architect, also yearns for vindication. This spring he told a meeting of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island that the American public still cries out for comprehensive reform, and added that President Clinton remains committed to the idea and will try again if a more receptive Congress is elected.
<P>
Having learned their lessons from the delays of the last round, liberal advocates expect to have a bill ready for speedy passage if Clinton is re-elected; their strategy is to strike before opponents have time to mount a campaign. Models currently being developed would begin with universal health coverage for all children, delivered through the structure of health-insurance purchasing cooperatives, government-defined benefits packages, and premium subsidies that characterized the original Clinton plan. The cynical calculation is that legislators would not dare vote against ``KidCare,'' and, once the foundation was in place, liberals could construct, brick by brick, the statist structure they originally envisioned.
<P>
This scenario could be dismissed as a paranoid nightmare -- except that Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) has forthrightly claimed it as his strategy. He openly acknowledges that he views the insurance-regulation bill he is co-sponsoring with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) as a down-payment on a federally controlled health-care system. Experience in several states indicates that this attempt to expand access to health insurance would drive up costs, destabilize the market for private health insurance, and leave even more Americans without health insurance, leading to more and more legislation. Which Sen. Kennedy is more than happy to provide. He says, ``We're going to get this done, and we're going to keep coming back at it. . . . If we have a big sweep for Democrats in the House and Senate, we'll get single-payer.''
<P>
The current liberal strategy, in short, which Clinton would continue in a second term, is to offer ``security'' in exchange for incremental losses of freedom, seducing the middle class step by step into dependence.
<P>
Conservatives, meanwhile, have their own incremental strategy. By offering individuals more control over their health-care costs through devices such as medical savings accounts (MSAs), they expect that market incentives will restructure the medical industry from top to bottom, and prove so popular that more and more Americans will demand the savings, efficiency, and security of owning their own health-insurance policies.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the White House and Sen. Kennedy have led the charge against MSAs. Conservatives have fought for months to include MSAs in the Kassebaum - Kennedy bill, but Democratic intransigence and Republican pusillanimity have left MSAs so bound and gagged with restrictions that many conservatives think passage of the bill would do more harm than good.
<P>
Both sides understand that, as with a great battleship, a small shift in the heading can over time lead to a vastly different destination. The competing visions of where Americans should be headed could not be more starkly opposed: in one, health care becomes a state-provided entitlement; in the other, individual freedom and responsibility allow a properly functioning health-care marketplace to evolve. The combatants can be expected to fight to the last breath -- in the 1996 elections and beyond.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font>  Clinton crime record is a centerpiece of the President's re-election campaign. And not surprisingly. After all, the Administration has had major legislative successes and has effectively controlled the policy debate.
<P>
Not that the victories have been cost-free. It was against the strong advice of then - Speaker Tom Foley and then - Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell that Clinton insisted on keeping the ``assault-weapon'' ban in the crime package. The decision may have had profound political effects. Several weeks after the 1994 elections, Clinton told the <I>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</I> that ``the fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their seats in Congress. . . . The NRA is the reason the Republicans control the House.''
<P>
In exchange, the President won a very small policy victory indeed. The banned guns look ugly, but they fire no faster than other guns, and generally use ammunition less powerful than do ordinary hunting rifles. According to gun-seizure statistics, they are almost never used in crime. Because the ban defines ``assault weapons'' in terms of cosmetic factors such as whether the barrel has a bayonet lug, gun manufacturers are currently selling nearly identical firearms, minus the offending bayonet lugs.
<P>
In placing form over substance, the gun ban perfectly illustrates the whole thrust of the Administration's crime policy. The much-vaunted funding for ``100,000 new cops on the street,'' for instance, actually provides funding for about 20,000 police and leaves localities stuck with the tab for the others. In a jurisdiction like Denver, the bill may add a half-dozen officers to a given shift -- hardly enough to make a real impact on crime control.
<P>
Similarly, the Administration's recently announced plan to trace guns illegally sold to juveniles was actually a long-standing program, trotted out as ``new'' for election purposes. And Clinton's current pet gun-control proposal, a ban on armor-piercing ammunition, was enacted by Congress in 1986. The proposal simply plays off media attention to an inventor's pipe dream about a new type of ammunition he said he was going to create.
<P>
Which isn't to say Clinton has had no impact. No President in American history has done more to promote electronic surveillance of the American people. The Federal Government is conducting wiretaps at record levels. The overwhelming majority of conversations tapped are innocent; of the guilty ones, most involve matters such as drugs and gambling; they are almost never used for bombing cases, the ostensible justification for the new grant of authority.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>O</font> President has been so consistently hostile to the separation between the Federal Government and the states. The Brady Act is an unfunded mandate on overburdened sheriffs and police chiefs to perform background checks on handgun buyers. Curfews, school uniforms, midnight basketball, automatically expelling students who bring guns or knives to school -- whether these policies are wise or unwise is debatable, but they have no business coming from Washington, D.C.
<P>
Centralization of law enforcement undermines accountability. As former Attorney General Edwin Meese put it, ``If voters are dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate officials out of office.'' Federal agencies, in contrast, are several steps removed from democratic control. Local control also means fiscal responsibility: federal anti-crime spending tends to tilt heavily toward programs -- such as DARE and the McGruff crime dog -- that sound good on the Senate floor but are proven failures. And federal law enforcement's priorities are not on the crimes against persons and property that most concern Americans, but instead on statutory offenses: controlled substances, firearms, and the like.
<P>
To make matters of centralization worse, Louis Freeh is working to make the FBI a national police force (sending G-men to enforce child-support orders!) and indeed an international one, as it sets up overseas offices and develops close working relationships with the KGB's successor.
<P>
In terms of demagogy, Clinton's performance on crime issues is exceptional. After the Oklahoma City bombing, the Administration began pushing a list of greatly expanded powers for federal law-enforcement agencies -- despite the fact that not one provision in the bill could even arguably have prevented the bombing. Thanks to the Administration's ``anti-terrorism'' initiative, the Federal Government can now, without any need to show probable cause, order credit bureaus to disclose parts of consumer credit records, wiretap radio modem communications, and deport or imprison aliens on the basis of secret evidence. Clinton's original proposal was even worse: it would have greatly expanded the definition of ``terrorism,'' eviscerated restraints on use of the military in domestic law enforcement, and abolished requirements that federal law-enforcement agencies act only within their jurisdiction.
<P>
There is no reason to doubt that a second Clinton Administration would follow a crime policy much like the first: to go as far as politically possible in using crime control as a pretext for constricting privacy and increasing the power of the Federal Government. These policies will not reduce street crime, and they will leave Americans much more vulnerable to the types of crime our Founders most feared: the depredations of a lawless Federal Government.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>S</font> a youth Bill Clinton rejected the segregation of his native South and embraced the series of federal laws that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, education, employment, and voting. Clinton believed that racial discrimination was morally wrong, but his view was not simply a product of reason. To put the President's own hackneyed phrase to perhaps its best use, he ``felt the pain'' of segregation. Thus, while not a civil-rights activist, organizing and demonstrating, Clinton became a race healer. He made a point of associating with blacks, and continued to do so even when black separatism started gaining strength.
<P>
At the Yale Law School, according to David Maraniss's biography, <I>First in His Class</I>, a table in the cafeteria that black law students (including Lani Guinier) claimed as their own sometimes had a white visitor -- Bill Clinton. One reason so few whites sat at this ``black table of solidarity'' is that they didn't know how to ``enter that world.'' Maraniss reports that while at first some blacks stared at Clinton ``as though he was an unwanted interloper,'' he soon won them over through his willingness to ``talk about whatever the black students were talking about, or tell his own tales about life in Arkansas, or joke about how he had not gone to class or read any of his law books.''
<P>
Clinton continued this winning way. As a young law professor at the University of Arkansas, Clinton, writes Maraniss, ``quickly became the friend and champion'' of black students. His ``relaxed style'' was a comfort to blacks in the classroom, and outside it Clinton went the extra mile by tutoring them. The black students nicknamed Clinton ``Wonder Boy.'' Said one, ``It was a miracle the way he was.''
<P>
It has proved a miracle relevant to Clinton's political career. He has always been more than the ordinary Democrat who by virtue of being a Democrat gets most of the ``black vote.'' He has indeed been the Wonder Boy, a white figure who enjoys exceptional black trust. As a result, Clinton has been positioned to do extraordinary things. And since 1992, when he burst onto the national stage, he sometimes has done them.
<P>
In June of that year, Clinton repudiated rap singer Sister Souljah for her comment, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, that ``if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people? . . . why not kill a white person?'' Clinton said these remarks were ``filled with hatred'' and that ``if you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.'' Sister Souljah's remarks, Clinton added, contributed to a noxious political environment ``of pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.'' There was a strategic calculation in what Clinton did: seeking to demonstrate his willingness to challenge core Democratic constituency groups, the candidate made his comments about Sister Souljah in a speech to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But his criticism of her also served to define his ``new covenant'' message in a way consistent with the best principles in American life. Thus, the new covenant was not merely a statement that ``we (whatever color we are) are all in this together,'' as Clinton said elsewhere in 1992, but also a recognition that, all of us being together, there's no place among us for racism of any variety, white or black. Though Jackson defended Sister Souljah against Clinton, many black leaders, including some who had backed presidential runs by Jackson, said Clinton was right to say what he did.
<P>
In late 1993, Clinton gave a speech in Memphis to black pastors. The speech was remarkable for its focus on the cultural problems afflicting black communities -- a taboo subject for white politicians. Clinton was so confident that he could handle this subject and still retain the approval of blacks that he even dared to imagine what Martin Luther King might be saying today -- namely, that ``I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others . . . I fought for freedom but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don't amount to anything. . . . I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.'' Clinton preached to the preachers that ``It is our moral duty to turn [this state of affairs] around,'' adding, ``We have to make our people whole again.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> use of the first-person plurals, ``our'' and ``we,'' made Clinton at one with his audience and the families they minister to. It was a dramatic demonstration of his solidarity with blacks. And it is this solidarity that has freed Clinton to endorse welfare reform, a project that could hit poor blacks harder than any other group. With the legislation of welfare reform, Clinton has now performed the Democratic equivalent of Richard Nixon's going to China.
<P>
There is not a chance, however, that Clinton will do the same with affirmative action. This, of course, was the great hope of New (and some old) Democrats. Early in 1993, the distinguished historian C. Vann Woodward wrote that Clinton ``rejects . . . racial preference'' and ``makes no separate case for the rights of racial minorities.'' Those have proved words to be eaten. Through 1994, the Clinton Administration was unable to find a racial preference it could not support, whether as a matter of policy or law, and in litigation (notably in the <I>Adarand</I> case and in voting-rights cases) it supported doctrine in effect making a separate case for the rights of minorities. But for the 1994 election results, which put affirmative action in the political dock, Clinton would not have felt compelled to review a single federal program containing preferences. Not that the Administration has greatly diverged from the left-lying affirmative action path it was on, although the press continues to report that Clinton has steered ``a middle course'' on affirmative action.
<P>
In his July 19, 1995, speech announcing the results of the Administration's review of affirmative action -- a speech given at the National Archives to an audience made up largely of civil-rights activists -- Clinton, wishing to ensure Jesse Jackson would not burden him with a primary challenge, announced his intention to ``mend, not end'' affirmative action. While the statement could be construed as a sign of progress -- to say that affirmative action needs ``mending'' is a concession that at least something about it is wrong -- there has over the past year been very little mending of affirmative action, and the only ending of an actual preferential device (two, by my count, have bit the dust) has occurred as a result of litigation. (See ``Don't Mend It, Defend It,'' by <a href="/nationalreview/clinton/therns.html">Abigail Thernstrom</a> .)
In practice, ``mending'' affirmative action has entailed the nurturing of a politics that, as the Democratic Leadership Council recognized in a statement critical of Clinton's policy conclusions, ``divides Americans most dramatically along racial lines,'' making it ``more rather than less difficult to transcend racial difference.'' According to Administration policy, found in policy papers, legal memos, and court filings, minorities need affirmative action, on the one hand, because non-minorities discriminate against them on account of race and, on the other, because their race and ethnicity are in themselves valuable commodities, providing ``diversity.'' Clinton's affirmative-action Presidency has left him unable to say with moral clarity why Louis Farrakhan, who has ascended into a position of black national leadership during the past four years, is wrong on matters of race.
<P>
Notwithstanding his 1992 admonition against pointing fingers across racial lines, Clinton has not been above doing that himself. In late 1993, campaigning in New York City for incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, he accused whites of being unwilling to vote for someone different from them, even though many whites had voted for Dinkins in 1989; in effect, he accused whites of racism. Two months ago, in a speech suggesting (against known evidence) that the black-church burnings were ``fires of [racial] hatred,'' Clinton warned against the raising of ``divisive'' issues during this election year. ``Every time you hear somebody use race or religion as an instrument of division and hatred, speak up against it.'' Subtly but unmistakably, Clinton suggested that anyone who questions affirmative action is using ``race as an instrument of division'' -- is a racist, in sum, no different from those who burn black churches. Republican timidity on the matter suggests that this effort to intimidate is succeeding.
<P>
On welfare Clinton may now be able to call himself a New Democrat. But on race he cannot say that. Instead, he has been aiding and abetting a politics of victimization and racial identity that threatens individual rights, denies the equal protection of the law, and divides the races. Wonder Boy, indeed.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> July 19, 1995, Bill Clinton gave one of the most-watched speeches of his Presidency. With a live television audience tuned in from around the country, he pledged to maintain affirmative-action programs. But he also promised to reform those programs that did not meet the constitutional test laid out by the Supreme Court just a month earlier, in <I>Adarand Constructors</I> v. <I>Pena</I>. ``Mend it, don't end it,'' the President said of affirmative action.
<P>
``Defend it'' would have been a more forthright description of the Administration's response. As Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, put it: ``It is important for us all not to be intimidated by <I>Adarand</I>. We have to take <I>Adarand</I> on.''
<P>
What the Supreme Court did in <I>Adarand</I> was to extend to federal programs its demand that race-based action meet the demanding test of narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest. Such programs would henceforth be subject to ``strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of judicial review.
<P>
Within three weeks of this decision the Administration had launched an all-out offensive to limit the Court-inflicted damage on its program of racial preferences. The first step was a June 28 Justice Department memo, written by Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger and intended to provide ``preliminary legal guidance'' to the general counsels of the executive agencies. The Dellinger memo was followed by a long-delayed White House review of federal affirmative-action programs that the President had ordered in February; written by Christopher Edley Jr. (special counsel to the President) and George Stephanopoulos, it promised ``a candid and balanced description'' of these programs, as well as a set of policy recommendations.
<P>
The Edley report was released the same day the President gave his ``Mend it, don't end it'' speech. Two months later, Deval Patrick testified before a House subcommittee on the proposed Equal Opportunity Act (the Dole - Canady bill), which had been introduced on the heels of the Edley review. And then on February 19, 1996, Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt issued a directive spelling out the implications of <I>Adarand</I> for federal employment. That memo was supplemented by still another on May 22 entitled ``Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement.''
<P>
The Administration had been hard at work. This was a fight from which the President could not run, he had said in a closed-door get-together with House Democrats on February 22, 1995. ``We have to outsmart the Republicans,'' he had declared -- and once five Supreme Court Justices had at least partially tied his hands with the <I>Adarand</I> ruling, his task included outsmarting the Court.
<P>
Only in retrospect was the Dellinger memo a hint of things to come; at the time, it read like a legitimate attempt to put the best face possible on <I>Adarand</I>, emphasizing the limits of the ruling and urging no precipitous action. But Dellinger's quick read of the decision was the Administration's last careful and lawyerly analysis. The Edley report, less than a month later, basically ignored the Supreme Court's holding. A brief on behalf of every federal affirmative-action program (the authors did not recommend eliminating a single one), it put the Administration on record as intending to carry bravely on.
<P>
As Edley and Stephanopoulos described them, these programs were above legal, political, or ethical reproach; the Court's concerns in <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions were thus woefully off base. The plurality in the Supreme Court's 1989 <I>Richmond</I> v. <I>Croson</I> decision had warned of the danger of ``stigmatic harm'' and ``racial hostility.'' Edley and Stephanopoulos spoke of policies that simply offered ``every American a fair chance to achieve success.'' They were a needed tool ``to move us away from a world of lingering biases . . . toward one in which opportunity is equal.'' The voice of these White House aides was, of course, precisely that of the President's. ``Affirmative action has been good for America,'' he said in his July 19 speech. ``When . . . done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration clearly has had a mission: saving the whole panoply of racial preferences that pervades government employment and contracting. That was fully apparent in the Schmidt memos.
<P>
In the first of these memos, <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions are treated as minor annoyances -- roadblocks that require a bit of ingenuity to get around. Schmidt concludes: ``nothing in <I>Adarand</I> requires a retreat.'' What the decision demanded was ``a demonstrable factual predicate'' for an agency's race-conscious actions. Those actions could be justified by statistical evidence indicating minority underrepresentation (a ``lingering effect'' of historic discrimination) or perhaps by ``an agency's operational need for a diverse workforce.'' It encouraged agencies to increase minority participation through race-neutral means, but said that if these failed, then race-conscious means were acceptable.
<P>
<font size=+3>S</font><font size=+1>OME</font> background is needed to understand Schmidt's second memo, which is actually the more interesting of the two. In 1994, Congress had enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), which constituted a bipartisan effort to streamline federal purchases of goods and services, ranging from construction to paper clips. Included was a government-wide extension of two tools that had previously been available only to the Defense Department -- namely, the so-called ``rule of two'' and a bidding preference. The ``rule of two'' allowed the Pentagon to remove a contract from competitive bidding any time there were at least two minority businesses eager to do the work. The bidding preference allowed the Pentagon to award a contract to a minority-owned company as long as the cost was no more than 10 per cent above that of the lowest bidder.
<P>
FASA could not take effect until final implementing regulations were issued -- a process complicated by <I>Adarand</I>. Schmidt's second memo offered a ``model'' for these regulations.
<P>
Once again, the Clinton Administration made clear its commitment to the entire edifice of federal race-conscious programs. The title promised ``Proposed Reforms.'' And yet Schmidt himself said his starting ``premise'' was ``a need for affirmative action in procurement,'' and George Stephanopoulos agreed that ``we want to do everything we can to promote minority contracting.'' Moreover, the memo's stated aim was to create ``a structure for race-conscious procurement . . . in a manner that will survive constitutional scrutiny.''
<P>
The entire report, in fact, can be read as an exercise in deception. The government had an indisputably compelling interest (a Fourteenth Amendment demand) in ``affirmative remedial efforts,'' the memo stated at the outset. Discrimination is a given, remedies thus a necessity -- remedies that are ``affirmative.'' The only issue was whether they were sufficiently ``narrowly tailored'' to meet the second half of the constitutional standard.
<P>
The question of narrow tailoring was thus the memo's focus. And to that end, Schmidt proposed several alleged ``reforms.'' For instance, white firms should be able, with slightly more ease, to prove their eligibility for participation in programs that give small, disadvantaged businesses a break. On its face, a limited but good suggestion; a month earlier, however, the assistant attorney general for civil rights had (with refreshing candor) admitted he was ``not convinced that means anything in practical terms.''
<P>
Likewise, the memo suggested that the usual goals and timetables should be replaced by ``benchmarks'' that would establish the appropriate level of minority contracting in each industry. There would be no fixed, permanent 10 per cent goal for highway construction, in other words. But the benchmarks would be set by determining ``the level of minority contracting that one would reasonably expect to find in a market absent discrimination or its effects.'' In other words, by figuring out how many minority businesses would get what sort of contracts had history been different -- had discrimination never occurred.
<P>
There were two problems with this proposal. The first was the fact that such allegedly exact calculations were the stuff of pseudo-scientific dreams.  The second problem was Schmidt's assumption that a paucity of minority firms in a particular sector of the economy always indicated discrimination or its ``lingering effects.'' Together they meant that procurement officers would continue to set goals (in effect quotas) that seemed ``fair.'' And to meet those goals, as the memo acknowledged, the government could continue to use such race-conscious mechanisms as bidding credits and bonus points for prime contractors who used minority subcontractors for part of the work. There was more, none of which changed the bottom line: <I>Adarand</I>, as the Justice Department had interpreted it, had been a waste of the Supreme Court's breath.
<P>
Times have changed. Preferences cannot survive the court of public opinion. Raw racial exclusion has almost disappeared, and the majority of Americans have never, in any case, viewed discrimination as the remedy for discrimination.
<P>
Federal set-aside programs and federal coercion to ensure the use of minority-owned firms have never been more vulnerable. And yet the Clinton Justice Department is still intent on keeping them safe and sound. Unless the public wakes up to the Administration's unabashed defense of racial preferences, four more years of President Clinton are likely to mean four more years in which such preferences remain alive and very well.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T THE</font> beginning of the twentieth century, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot entered the United States. American Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed on two basic goals: teach the newcomers English and make them Americans. The clear aim was to strengthen our national identity -- to reinforce the <I>unum</I> in <I>E pluribus unum</I> -- by assimilating the new arrivals into American civilization.
<P>
As the twentieth century nears its end, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot are, once again, entering the United States. Today, however, the American President, William Jefferson Clinton, promotes policies that are directly opposed to the strategies advocated by Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Instead of promoting Americanization and emphasizing the learning of English, the current occupant of the White House favors policies to weaken our national identity -- de facto anti-assimilation measures, anti-English-language initiatives, and an indifference to substantive citizenship training.
<P>
President Clinton and Education Secretary Riley tell us that their goal in supporting bi-lingual education is ``transitional.'' Schools should teach basic subjects in the children's ``primary language,'' so that they do not fall behind in math, science, history, and the like while they are learning English. Education professionals, however -- the people who actually run the schools -- strongly emphasize ``cultural preservation.'' Thus the Los Angeles Unified School District advises teachers ``not to encourage language-minority'' parents to speak English at home, but instead ``to encourage them to strongly promote development of the primary (non-English) language'' in their children. Current law buttresses the bi-lingual establishment by requiring that 75 per cent of all programs for newcomers be taught in the student's native language. This is at odds with proven principles of learning a second language, which is best done by writing and speaking it as much as possible, not simply by attending a one-hour class five days a week.
<P>
Even measured by its own criteria, bi-lingual education is a failure. It neither teaches English well, nor keeps students from falling behind in other subjects. A recent and comprehensive evaluation reported in the major research journal sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English found that ``there is no body of research evidence to support the notion that non-English-speaking children will read, write, and do academic work in English better if they learn to read, write, and do academic work in their home language first.''
<P>
The dismal failure of bi-lingual education to teach children English has led to open revolts by Hispanic parents in New York, California, New Jersey, and Nebraska. In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, 150 Latino parents organized to fight for English instruction for their children. Sister Kathy Maire, a Roman Catholic nun working with the parents, stated: ``The bottom line is these kids are being robbed of their futures.'' In Los Angeles some 100 Hispanic parents pulled their children out of a local school to protest bi-lingual education. Indeed, a U.S. Department of Education survey of Mexican- and Cuban-American parents revealed that four-fifths opposed teaching their children in Spanish, if this meant that less time would be devoted to English. Unfortunately, the education bureaucracy has a vested interest in keeping children in bi-lingual programs, because as the students ``transition out'' of native-language instruction, the schools lose government funds.
<P>
In this fight the Clinton Administration has from the beginning stood on the side of the bi-lingual establishment. Even before he was elected President, Bill Clinton, in an article in <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I> (October 1992), blasted the Bush Administration for not spending enough money on bi-lingual education. Once in power the Clintonites have not simply advocated more money for existing bi-lingual programs; they have expanded multi-lingual education. For example, the Administration's major education bill, the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, authorized federal funds to develop written grammars for previously oral American Indian and Native Alaskan languages. Thus instead of merely ``preserving'' primary languages, bi-lingual education under Clinton may include inventing what are essentially new written languages.
<P>
For the first time, the congressionally mandated National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), the ``Nation's Report Card,'' will be given in Spanish as well as in English. Deputy Education Secretary Madelein Kunin sent a memorandum to the civil servant in charge of the tests stating that ``excluding'' children whose English is limited violated the Civil Rights Act and ordering that these students be accommodated by providing them with Spanish versions of the math and science tests. The irony in giving the tests for the ``Nation's Report Card'' to American students in a language other than English appears to have gone unnoticed by either the Clinton Administration or the Republican Congress, which has remained mute on this issue. As Jorge Amselle of the Center for Equal Opportunity put it, ``If [the students] ace a history test in Spanish and flunk it in English, it's not going to do them any good when they go to get a job.''
<P>
Although Bill Clinton signed an official-English bill when he was governor of Arkansas, the Clinton Administration has opposed efforts by Republicans and by moderate and conservative Democrats in the 104th Congress to declare English the official language of the United States. The Administration also opposes congressional efforts to stop requiring states to provide ballots in other languages as discrimination against Americans who don't speak English.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, in a brilliant new book, <I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship</I> (to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press next month), chronicles in painful detail the steady diminution of naturalization -- the once meaningful process of immigrants' becoming American citizens. While the ``dumbing down'' of citizenship did not begin on January 20, 1993, it has clearly accelerated under the Clinton Administration. In December 1995 the Administration expanded the use of foreign languages on citizenship tests; four hundred new centers give the test in Spanish. Plans are under way to offer tests in Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> attitude toward the importance of English for American citizenship is reflected in the comments of Jess Nieto, a director of one of the ``community organizations'' authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to give citizenship tests. Nieto declared, ``Many of these people [resident aliens applying for citizenship] have been here a million years. Why should they have to take the test in English?''
<P>
The citizenship tests themselves have been stripped of much of the rich historical, civic, and patriotic content that once made studying for and passing the test a truly gratifying experience in the life of a new American citizen. Even the dignified and moving court ceremony for swearing in new immigrants is no longer mandatory. Besides the INS, over eight hundred organizations are now eligible to give citizenship tests. Leftist advocacy groups such as the Asylum and Refugee Rights Project, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under the Law, and the Mexican - American Legal Defense and Educational Fund are working closely with the INS. Ironically, activist lawyers who spend their working hours litigating against any legal distinctions between citizens and non-citizens are often running the official process that makes resident aliens American citizens. Even the Heritage of Aztlan Educational and Cultural Foundation -- a group which romanticizes irredentist Mexican claims to the ``lost territories'' of the Southwestern United States -- is busy giving tests in American history and civics to candidates for American citizenship.
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>EANWHILE</font>, the Clinton Administration has begun a project of instant mass naturalization, Citizenship USA. Hundreds of federal workers from other agencies have been detailed to the INS to process citizenship applications. In one case in California, special personnel worked from dawn to dusk for two months and naturalized sixty thousand resident aliens. According to an article by Ruth Larson in the <I>Washington Times</I>, a career INS official stated that a White House staffer admitted to him, ``Quite frankly, it's 250,000 registered voters who are likely to vote Democratic.''
<P>
Attitudes about citizenship and American identity are revealed in the words and actions of Clinton appointees. For example, Eugene Garcia, Clinton's bi-lingual-education chief from 1993 to 1995, told a conference of bi-lingual educators, ``The border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that border shall be nonexistent.'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has suggested that the inspiring Oath of Allegiance, in which new citizens promise to ``absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, . . . support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; . . . bear arms on behalf of the United States; . . . take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: so help me God,'' is ``anachronistic'' and should be changed.
<P>
One of Mrs. Meissner's top political appointees, Executive Associate Commissioner Robert Bach, was the principal author of a Ford Foundation report on immigrant communities in 1993. Bach recommended that non-citizens be permitted, indeed ``encouraged,'' to vote in city and school-board elections. In fact, the terms ``citizen'' and ``citizenship'' are rarely mentioned in the report; instead Bach uses the term ``established resident.'' He is critical of assimilation, suggests that too much ``homogeneity'' may be ``the problem in America,'' and emphasizes that long-established residents should ``accommodate'' the newcomers with multi-lingualism instead of assimilating them into mainstream society. Another of Mrs. Meissner's chief lieutenants, Alexander Alienikoff, has, according to Georgie Anne Geyer, ``argued constantly that it was time no longer to distinguish or differentiate between citizens and legal aliens.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration has unleashed the coercive power of federal agencies  against opponents of its anti-assimilation and multi-lingual policies. Thus on February 24, 1995, after the city council of Allentown, Pennsylvania, voted 6 to 1 to declare English the official language of their city, the city clerk received a call from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warning him that Allentown could lose federal funds if the city council did not repeal the ordinance. A Clinton appointee, Assistant Secretary Roberta Achtenberg, launched an investigation and suggested that the city's ordinance might violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Twenty-three Congressmen sent a letter to HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros demanding an explanation. Finally, after the city government promised not to implement the ordinance, the inquiry was canceled.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N</font> August 1995, the chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Clinton appointee Mary Frances Berry, subpoenaed members of the Florida-187 Committee to appear before a Commission hearing on ``racism.'' Mrs. Berry demanded that the group -- which supports a Florida initiative patterned after California's attempt to deny most public benefits to illegal aliens -- turn over all its computer printouts, reports, policy studies, memoranda, and internal documents. JoAnn Peart, a housewife from Delray Beach, one of the individuals subpoenaed, contacted Republican Congressman Mark Foley, who asked the Subcommittee on the Constitution to hold oversight hearings on the Civil Rights Commission's action. A group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to President Clinton stating that the Commission's action was a ``clear violation'' of citizens' ``right to engage in political activities without being intimidated or harassed by a government entity.'' Shortly after this uproar Mary Frances Berry withdrew the subpoenas.
<P>
For the past several decades Americans have had a continuing argument over two visions of the future, an argument that will determine the fate of our national identity. Do we promote English or multi-lingualism? Do we strengthen American citizenship or do we diminish it? Should we be a multi-ethnic nation or a multi-cultural one? A multi-ethnic nation means an America composed of individual citizens belonging to racial and ethnic groups from all over the world. On the other hand, a multi-cultural nation emphasizes group identity, not individual citizenship. It establishes different legal and language ``rights'' for different racial and ethnic groups, rejects assimilation, and erases distinctions between citizens and non-citizens.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Clinton Administration has joined the battle on the side of multi-lingualism and multiculturalism. The words and deeds of Clintonites Achtenberg, Aleinikoff, Bach, Berry, Cisneros, Garcia, Kunin, and Meissner are clear and consistent: expand official multi-lingualism wherever possible; water down the substantive meaning of citizenship; blur distinctions between citizens and non-citizens; advocate voting by non-citizens; and use Federal Government power to harass opponents of these policies.
<P>
Recently, Congress has started to challenge the Administration. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R., La.) succeeded in cutting bi-lingual education. Congressmen Toby Roth (R., Wisc.), Randy Cunningham (R., Calif.), and John Porter (R., Ill.) and Senator Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) have introduced legislation strengthening the use of English. On August 1, a bill making English the official language of the U.S. and allowing states to eliminate multilingual ballots passed the House. Despite these efforts, the multi-lingual/multi-cultural infrastructure will remain intact. For example, Congressman Roth's initiative to eliminate bi-lingual education is stalled in the House, and the Senate will almost certainly restore multi-lingual ballots when it votes on ``official English'' in September. If the bill passes, a veto is expected. Most importantly, a serious and sustained intellectual and moral argument against the continuing assault on American national identity has not yet been heard. In the final analysis, the struggle between multi-ethnic America and multi-cultural America will be won by the side that is able to articulate an intellectual and moral argument that resonates with the American people.
<P>
The Clinton Administration and their multi-lingualist allies have not made a compelling case for their radical new vision of America, but they have largely succeeded in scaring off and intimidating potential opposition. Their strategy is name calling -- denounce opponents of official multi-lingualism as ``mean-spirited,'' ``racists,'' and ``bigots.'' Thus the American Civil Liberties Union characterizes opposition to official multi-lingualism in terms of ``hate mongering'' and ``fostering bigotry and intolerance.''
<P>
No wonder opponents of official multi-lingualism have been hesitant to make this a major issue, knowing they will be vilified as ``racists'' and ``bigots.'' My guess, however, is that the great silent majority of Americans from all ethnic and racial backgrounds is waiting -- indeed hungering -- to hear the voice of multi-ethnic America challenge the multi-lingual/multi-cultural forces and dislodge them from the moral high ground.
<P>
This voice of multi-ethnic America would tell us: We the People of the United States, a self-governing and free people, have a moral right to transmit our way of life and our national heritage to future generations of Americans. Fluency in English is essential for full participation in our society. To tell newcomers to America otherwise is to lie to them. To be an American citizen is a privilege, not a right. To cheapen citizenship and blur the boundaries between citizens and non-citizens is to mock the sacrifices that have sustained our nation for more than two hundred years. If we don't take citizenship seriously we don't take our constitutional democracy seriously.
<P>
Therefore, we should establish English as our official language, eliminate bi-lingual education and multi-lingual ballots, and end the corruption of our naturalization process. Moreover, as people on both sides of the immigration debate -- including Linda Chavez, John Miller, Dan Stein, and the late Barbara Jordan -- have suggested, it is time to launch a new civic integration effort, similar to the Americanization initiatives earlier this century. Nothing could be more welcoming and inclusive than fostering English and teaching the responsibilities of citizenship to newcomers. Those of us whose parents or grandparents came through Ellis Island at the turn of the century are particularly grateful that Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson advocated Americanization, instead of multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism.
<P>
Opposition to official multi-lingualism does not mean that Americans should not learn foreign languages, or that we are not free to speak whatever language we want, or that languages other than English cannot be used in places such as courts and hospitals. It does not mean ``English only.'' It means that English should be the <I>official</I> language of <I>public</I> business in our liberal democracy.
<P>
Yes, as with people everywhere, there is bigotry among us. However, the genius of America is that we have worked to overcome unfair discrimination and irrational prejudice. To make the learning of English a priority and to strengthen the substance of citizenship does not mean we are ``racists'' and ``bigots'' -- it means that we take our national heritage and our democracy seriously.
<P>
It is the advocates of bi-lingual education who have prevented Latino kids from advancing. It is a patronizing establishment that is stealing their keys to the American dream.
<P>
The position advanced by the multicultural establishment amounts to a bluff. It is at odds with the feelings and instincts both of the American majority and of the minorities that these policies are allegedly designed to help. What is needed is an open discussion of the facts and values in question. Once that happens, the bluff will be called and the great American public will demand that we end official multi-lingualism, eliminate bi-lingual education and foreign language ballots, take naturalization seriously, and, in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, launch a new campaign for Americanization and civic integration.

The spectacle of someone like me, an immigrant, who is also a recent arrival on the political scene, offering advice to America's senior professional politician is one of concern to me.

It is, thus, of even greater concern to me that the Dole campaign -- the means by which to forestall the alteration-beyond-recognition of this miracle called America -- appears glued to the bottom of a hole in the ground. The other side continues to set the agenda; we remain on the defensive.
<p>
It is in this moment of despair that I request your attention, Senator Dole. One might think: A look at you, a look at the alternative would be sufficient to get you about 85 per cent of the popular vote. Alas, it is not sufficient. What the campaign needs is a different perspective. The time for traditional strategies which secure the Irish vote, the Jewish vote, the union vote, the senior-citizen vote, the black vote, the Southern vote, the women's vote, has passed. The time has come to seek the <I>American</I> vote.
<P>
Notwithstanding thirty years of concerted effort by the other side to subdivide us into irreconcilable groups, most of us still believe that we are, first and last, Americans.
<P>
It is easy to overlook the simple and obvious, precisely because you, Senator Dole, ``hold these truths to be self-evident.'' But people in Seattle and San Francisco, in San Antonio and Fort Myers, in Topeka, New London, St. Joseph -- even in Washington, D.C. -- would love to be reminded by you that this nation was founded on a set of principles which reflect the most thoughtful deliberation on the human condition ever undertaken. Talk to them about the thousands of years it had taken to establish equality before the law for every individual, now threatened by the ever-increasing demand for group rights; they need to realize that <I>group rights signal the end of individual rights</I>. Explain that one cannot ``almost'' guarantee private property, that its sanctity is the cornerstone of all civilization. They know the strength of your sentiments about judges who legislate from the bench; add to this the reminder that separation of powers -- not permitting the same people to make, interpret, and enforce the law -- is the fragile membrane protecting us from dictatorship. You might add, too, that you agree with the Founders, who envisioned no role in education for the Federal Government but who most certainly charged it with responsibility for the common defense.
<P>
Americans would love to hear you say that you will move to dismantle those regulatory and judicial straitjackets which are choking tolerance and voluntarism. Above all, reassure them that people who say ``In God we trust'' are echoing, not violating, the Founders' intent.
<P>
The language the Founders spoke was English; their deeply held beliefs came from the Old and New Testaments. Yet they benefited not only those whom the Founders represented but, in uncommon measure, those who arrived later, speaking different languages and desiring the freedom to live by their different beliefs. Above all, they bestowed upon their posterity the incomparable blessings of a polity in which the peaceful transition of power is the norm.
<P>
The other side will point to its standardized list of grievances aimed at the Founders. You might remind them that the founding principles were but a road map to guide us toward an ever-improving future. The map was based largely on the English legacy, which -- like all others -- was stained with blood. But unlike all others, it was from the start striving for a justice which cannot be bought or sold; for freedom on the high seas and in people's minds; for decency in human conduct and for honorable compromise in place of strife. We ought to continue speaking the language of this legacy. English has given us the word <I>fairness</I>. No other language has yet come up with even a translation of this word.
<P>
Americans may know, but will be glad to hear you say, where your ideas have originated. This would also create an opportunity to discuss where the other side obtained its. By ``other side'' I do not mean true Democrats: indeed, many of <I>them</I> might seize the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer to those whose ideas clearly derive from the opposing doctrine.
<P>
This doctrine has worn many labels -- Fascism, Bolshevism, National Socialism, Communism, Trotskyism, Social Democracy, Maoism, and present-day so-called Liberalism -- but all stand for some variation of socialist philosophy. The practices were developed in the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin School for Behavior Control, priding itself in such stellar graduates as Hitler and Stalin.
<P>
Nothing even remotely comparable in violence is contemplated by latter-day disciples: the current approach is low-key, sophisticated. Your recent encounter with tobacco, Senator, was a measure of its success. Tobacco, of course, has long been selected for an experiment in incremental behavior control. The process begins with an eminently reasonable suggestion, such as setting aside a few tables in restaurants, a few rows in airplanes. No one could possibly object. Semi-scientific ``evidence'' follows and selective name-calling commences. A <I>crescendo</I> is generated in the public discourse, leading to public hysteria, as the selected target is declared the dragon to be slain at all cost. As with every other item on the agenda, we are never told where the campaign intends to end. We sit in Edgar Allan Poe's cell, helplessly watching as the four walls and the ceiling close in on us.
<P>
By now, the targets, methods, and slogans of the other side have achieved such perfection (they <I>appear</I> so reasonable, compassionate, equitable) that exposing their true origins, along with the destruction that invariably follows in their wake, is the only way for our side to win. Lead us on to a winning course, Senator Dole. If they say, ``Character does not matter -- issues matter,'' tell them that <I>principles</I> matter even more. Serve notice that henceforth issues will be discussed first as they relate to our founding principles. Thus, the issue is not affirmative action, but equality before the law; not cutting off immigration, but inviting only those whose desire to become American; not the level of funding for Goals 2000, but restating where government has, and where it has not, a role to perform. Take the lead, and watch candidates -- and voters -- line up behind you.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>MMIGRATION</font>  experts generally agree that the Clinton Administration has devoted  more attention to immigration than either of its two Republican predecessors. Mr. Clinton's policies, however, tend to be reactive, and he always has at least two reactions: his initial public statement (determined largely by public-opinion polls, which show support for restrictions), and then the actual policy (as determined by his advisors and the various special interests they represent).
<P>
Let's begin with a look at Clinton's record on illegal immigration, since that is a major focus of his re-election campaign, particularly in California, a must-win state. Less than three months after taking office Clinton sent to Congress his Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which included cutting 93 Border Patrol positions. Four months later, Clinton responded to pressure from California Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (who was gearing up for re-election) by giving a speech in which he proclaimed that ``our borders leak like a sieve'' and urged that $45.1 million be spent to beef up the Border Patrol, including six hundred new agents. He failed to mention that the House had already approved an additional $60 million for the Border Patrol, or that the Senate Appropriations Committee had approved an additional $45 million.
<P>
In September 1993, the Border Patrol chief in El Paso, Silvestre Reyes, proved, on his own initiative, that illegal immigration could be reduced by up to 75 per cent, without a massive increase in money or personnel, by focusing on deterrence instead of apprehension. The Administration, apparently incensed that an employee would dare to be innovative without prior approval, ostracized Reyes and dismissed his hugely successful strategy as unworkable in other border areas. During the next few months, because of California's Proposition 187, Sen. Feinstein's neck-and-neck race with Republican challenger Michael Huffington, and Democrat Kathleen Brown's floundering bid to unseat Gov. Pete Wilson, the Administration was motivated to come up with its own plan to curb illegal immigration in San Diego. Thus, on October 1, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno unveiled the multi-million-dollar Operation Gatekeeper, heralded as an El Paso-type deterrence strategy, but actually more like the old (and unsuccessful) cat-and-mouse apprehension strategy.
<P>
Clinton repeatedly holds up Operation Gatekeeper as proof that he is more serious than Republicans about controlling illegal immigration. Border Patrol statistics, however, show that the number of illegal aliens apprehended in San Diego actually <I>increased</I> in all but three months of the first year and a half of Gatekeeper, rather than declining by the 70 per cent or so that Administration officials had promised.
<P>
These statistics presented something of a problem for the Administration until April 1996, when apprehensions in San Diego suddenly began to plummet. Two months later, the Administration was facing allegations that Border Patrol officials were falsifying arrest records to get the numbers down.
<P>
The Clinton Administration's record on political asylum is similar. During his first presidential campaign, Clinton berated George Bush for the latter's policy of returning Haitian boat people to Haiti for asylum interviews. Clinton pledged to provide a safe haven for the fleeing Haitians. Soon after the election, however, media reports that Haitians were building large numbers of boats to take advantage of his generosity spurred an angry public reaction. He immediately announced that he would maintain the Bush policy. This was only the first of many Clinton flip-flops on Haiti.
<P>
And then came the Cuban rafters. First, Clinton directed that their asylum claims be screened on board the Coast Guard ships that picked them up. When the ships filled up, Clinton directed that the Cubans be diverted to Guantanamo for asylum interviews. When Guantanamo began to fill up, with no end in sight, Clinton made a deal with Fidel Castro: the United States would admit a <I>minimum</I> of twenty thousand Cuban immigrants each year if Castro would agree to halt the outflow of rafters. Attorney General Reno announced that no Cubans would be admitted to the United States directly from Guantanamo (this was supposed to entice them to leave Guantanamo and return home voluntarily). The vast majority of Guantanamo Cubans are now settled in Miami -- after being transported directly from Guantanamo.
<P>
Seven months into his term, Clinton proposed legislation that included expedited exclusion for frivolous asylum claimants, an increase in INS asylum personnel, and various anti-smuggling provisions. But it didn't take long for the President to succumb to pressure from immigrant-advocacy, refugee-rights, and lawyers' groups and abandon the legislative package in favor of a watered-down package of administrative reforms that would have had little impact except for a provision that decouples the work permit from the asylum-application process.
<P>
For most of the past four years, the Administration has spoken about the need to reform the asylum system and reduce fraudulent applications. In most cases these statements have come in reaction to the latest crisis: Haiti, Cuba, the World Trade Center bombing, the <I>Golden Venture</I> incident (Clinton promised that the Chinese arriving on that ship would be swiftly deported, but many still are languishing in U.S. jails). But all the while, it has been broadening the asylum system to advance its social agenda. Under U.S. law, asylum is for people facing <I>state-sponsored political persecution</I>, but we now grant asylum, for example, to women facing genital mutilation. The latest Administration proposal reportedly is to grant asylum to aliens who are HIV positive (even though such aliens are not legally permitted to immigrate to this country).
<P>
Finally, there is President Clinton's record on legal immigration. In June 1995, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended a modest cut in legal immigration and the elimination of some extended-family immigration categories. President Clinton immediately endorsed the recommendations as ``consistent with my own views'' and added that they ``are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization.'' Both Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Tex.) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) modeled their immigration bills on the Commission's recommendations, believing logically enough that they would encounter little resistance after Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement.
<P>
Unfortunately, Barbara Jordan died before the Smith and Simpson bills reached the floor, allowing Clinton to renege on his endorsement without risking a Jordan tongue-lashing (one Commission staffer told me he's glad he's not the one who will have to explain Clinton's reversal to Miss Jordan on the other side of the Pearly Gates). So, during the Senate Judiciary Committee markup of the Simpson bill, Attorney General Reno and INS Commissioner Meissner personally lobbied senators to support an amendment by Sen. Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.) to split the legislation into one bill on illegal immigration and one on legal, thus effectively killing any chance for legal-immigration reform in the Senate. Two days before the final House vote on the Smith bill, President Clinton sealed the fate of legal-immigration reform by announcing his support for an amendment by Reps. Dick Chrysler (R., Mich.), Howard Berman (D., Calif.), and Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) to eliminate from the bill the reductions in legal immigration.
<P>
In sum, the Clinton Administration has rejected the one proven strategy for controlling illegal immigration, broadened the grounds for asylum, and killed legal-immigration reform.
<P>
(One final note: If you did not find your favorite Clinton immigration flip-flop here, I apologize -- the list was so long I had to pick and choose.)

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>ORE</font> than a thousand people have died and millions have had to flee their homes, the wires have reported, during recent flooding of the Yangtze River. By historic standards this is a modest flood. Tens of thousands drown every few years in Yangtze floods, and there have been cases when millions died from the uncontrolled waters of China's largest river spilling its banks.
<P>
Lord knows the Communist dynasty ruling in Peking has many crimes to account for, but attempting to tame the waters of the Yangtze to save its citizens from those deadly floods surely does not rank among them. Yet the Clinton Administration has given extraordinarily high priority to sabotaging the financing of the Three Gorges Dam, China's $12-billion effort to control the floods. To save fresh-water dolphins, Siberian cranes, and picturesque rugged scenery, the Administration has worked assiduously to stop the project. Samuel Berger, deputy National Security Advisor, intervened with the supposedly independent Ex-Im Bank to stop commercial credits for it. As a result, Caterpillar and other U.S. companies seeking to sell equipment in competition with Japanese and European manufacturers have been handicapped, and the cost of building the dam increased. Behind the scenes the Administration also threatened to use its veto power at the World Bank and other international agencies to prevent them from lending money for the Three Gorges project.
<P>
Now, there may be legitimate criticisms of the design of the Three Gorges dam. It may be Stalinist gargantuism. Maybe a design with several smaller dams would have been better? Maybe the scenery and endangered species could have been accommodated to a  greater degree, while still providing flood control and electricity? Such questioning of detail would be one thing. But the U.S. position under the Clinton Administration has been one of outright hostility to the aims of the Yangtze project, reflecting a humanity-hating environmentalism that dwells on possible dangers to birds and fish while cavalierly disregarding the needs of tens of millions of people. This extreme brand of environmentalism pervades the Clinton Administration.
<P>
Indeed, its ``integrating'' this environmentalism into all aspects of government has been a major internal goal of the Clinton Administration. In foreign policy, for example, this has meant creating a new under-secretary position for environmental affairs at the Department of State, a position given to Green ex-Senator Timothy Wirth; designating a senior officer at each embassy as ``environmental point person''; and identifying environmentalist doctrine as part of the United States vital interests. A memorandum from Secretary of State Warren Christopher dated February 14 to all embassies and bureaus of the State Department said that ``environmental concerns'' will henceforth be a key component of U.S. foreign policy. Environmental issues are to be ``integrated'' into ``bureau and mission program plans,'' into ``trip plans,'' and into ``talking points for bilateral meetings involving the President and other senior officials.'' In short, every U.S. official is under orders to become an environmentalist scold.
<P>
One hopes that the vast majority of U.S. officials will just go through the motions, generating the usual statements about recycling, energy conservation, ozone-layer protection, dolphin protection, and suchlike, and inserting them into their memoranda. But there has been a steady entrenchment of this stuff even as the bits and pieces of science underpinning it are demonstrated to be junk.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>AKE</font> that mother of all scares, global warming. Simply put, there isn't any global warming. It isn't happening, according to the most sophisticated temperature measurement by balloon and satellite. There's a lot of theory and many fancy computer modelings about why it should be happening. But it just isn't there on the thermometers.
<P>
So now we have parts of the Clinton Administration engaging in Statistical Fraud 101. Any time series of a phenomenon like average temperature by year will bump up and down, and elementary junk science yields a handy means of ``proving'' an upward trend. Search a series for a couple of low years and start off with those; then cut off your trend line when you've got a couple of high years. The global-warming junkmeisters at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just last month did that in an article in Nature magazine using temperature data from 1963 to 1987. Given that 1964 was extraordinarily cold and 1987 very hot, these cheerleaders for Al Gore produced a good-looking uptrend.
<P>
Of course when you include the data from a few years before 1963 and the years since 1987 -- as Patrick Michaels, a University of Virginia climatologist, quickly did -- you get what every reputable calculation of the thermometer data shows, which is that there is no up-trend.
<P>
More recently, the Administration made a major shift leftward to embrace a canon of environmentalist fundamentalism that it had previously found too hot politically -- mandatory limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Green Czar Timothy Wirth announced a new U.S. policy of mandatory limits on carbon-dioxide emissions at a press conference in Geneva July 16 saying the United States was proposing a ``radical'' international accord: ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed on internationally.'' This radical approach has never been the subject of any reasoned Administration statement or testimony, let alone the subject of major study by a serious scientific panel. Indeed, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study a couple of years ago said that if global warming does occur humanity can adapt, since the computer-forecast changes in climate are similar in magnitude to natural changes. But the Administration is going by green-faith, and science is useful to it only insofar as it supports that faith.
<P>
By pushing an international accord on suppressing greenhouse gases, evangelists of environmentalism such as Mr. Wirth are able to take the huge issues of constraining our power stations and industries out of domestic policy forums. If the accord is agreed to in Geneva, then it gains international legitimacy and opponents at home are disparaged as ``flying in the face of world opinion and advocating that we flout international law.''
<P>
At the same time that users of the carbon fuels of coal, oil, and gas are under pressure from the threatened mandatory international controls driven by the warming scare, the nuclear-power industry is not being allowed to dispose of its wastes. The Clinton Department of Energy, under environmentalist influence, is stalling on the opening of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear-waste repository in Nevada with years' more studies of possible seismic and other dangers. What was supposed to open in 1998 now cannot open before 2010, the Administration says.
<P>
Nuclear power plants have such a good safety record in operation that their opponents rely on hypothetical problems of waste disposal to stop new plants and to get existing ones closed. And so high-level wastes are accumulating onsite year by year at a hundred nuclear plants around the country because the Administration won't open the long-term repository that has been built in Nevada.
<P>
Meanwhile the green assault on synthetic chemicals is being pushed within the Environmental Protection Agency in a bold move to dispense with a hitherto unchallenged part of science -- the EPA proposes to simply omit from it as cancer-test guidelines the test of statistical significance -- the classic scientific tool for measuring the possibility that study results reflect chance rather than a regular association. As the newsletter <I>EPA WATCH</I> reported: ``Reducing the role of statistical significance or eliminating it altogether, could open the door for EPA to drastically expand the number of substances subject to environmental regulation.'' The newsletter might have added: and allow the EPA to regulate in an even more arbitrary fashion than now -- at home and abroad.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1992</font>, the economy grew by 2.7 per cent. Candidate Bill Clinton described that as ``the worst economic performance in fifty years.'' In 1995 the economy grew by around 2 per cent. Yet in this January's State of the Union message, the President said the economy is ``the healthiest in thirty years.'' So on which, if either, occasion was Bill Clinton telling the truth?
<P>
By every conceivable measure of income, output, or productivity, the economy has performed poorly on Clinton's watch, particularly in comparison with what Bob Bartley dubbed ``the seven fat years'' of 1983 to 1989.
<P>
<b>Gross domestic product:</b> Real GDP, the most comprehensive measure of the economy's output, grew by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.9 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Productivity:</b> Growth of output per hour in the non-farm business sector averaged only 0.5 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department figures on ``multifactor productivity'' show the ratio of capital to labor falling in 1993 - 94, which inevitably slows the growth of productivity, real wages, and family incomes.
<P>
<b>Real disposable income:</b> After-tax personal income rose by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.5 per cent in 1983 - 89.
Real labor compensation: Real hourly wages and benefits rose by 7 per cent in 1981 - 88, but were virtually flat from 1988 to 1995.
<P>
<b>Employment:</b> As measured by the household survey, employment grew by only 1.9 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Measured by an alternative survey of business (which may count the same workers twice), payroll employment grew by 2.6 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, but that too was down from 3 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Labor force:</b> The supply of new workers slowed to 0.8 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.8 per cent in 1983 - 89. Demographics can't begin to explain this huge and sudden drop in the willingness to look for work, but disincentives in our tax and transfer payments can.
<P>
<b>Savings:</b> Gross private savings amounted to only 14.6 per cent of GDP in 1993 - 95, down from 17.2 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
Was this trip really necessary?
<P>
Even in the very few areas where the economy appears to have fared relatively well, it still fails to measure up to the lofty standards set by the Reagan years. The Clinton Administration points with pride to growth of real exports, which did indeed rise at an 8.3 per cent rate over the past three years. But imports grew faster -- at a 10 per cent rate. In 1983 - 89, by contrast, real exports grew by 9.4 per cent a year, and imports by 8.6 per cent.
<P>
One statistic almost summarizes all the rest: Median family income fell by more than 5 per cent from 1989 through 1994 (the latest available figure). By contrast, median family income rose by 12.6 per cent from 1982 to 1989. These figures are before taxes, so they understate the actual drop in living standards following the 1993 increase in taxes on incomes, Social Security benefits and gasoline.
<P>
Income statistics for 1995 and 1996 are unlikely to look much better. Real wages were flat in 1995, and employment nearly so (by January 1996, employment was only 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier). Wages picked up a bit in early 1996, but so did inflation. The increase in consumer prices averaged 3.6 per cent in the first half of this year, wiping out nominal wage increases in the process. Recent employment gains have slowed to 1.5 per cent or less, compared with the same month a year ago.
<P>
Because employment grew at about the same slow 2 per cent pace as the economy in the past three years, it follows that output per worker (productivity) must have grown very slowly. Indeed, productivity growth averaged only 0.6 per cent in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 in 1983 - 89. There is no mystery at all about why real wages have stagnated in the past three years, despite a flood of misinformed news reports on that topic. Real output per worker and real income per worker are just two different ways of looking at the same thing. If we don't produce more, there won't be more to go around.
<P>
The Clinton Administration would much prefer to reduce all these uncomfortable economic comparisons to a single statement -- namely, the claim that the President himself has personally ``created'' nearly ten million jobs. The reason for that single-minded focus is obvious: ten million new jobs sounds like an impressive number. In fact, it isn't. If employment had grown as rapidly in 1993 - 95 as it did in 1983 - 89, the economy would have generated two million <I>more</I> jobs than it did between the end of 1992 and 1995.
<P>
There are two ways the unemployment rate can go down. One is for employers to offer more jobs. The other is for fewer people to go looking for jobs (to be listed as unemployed you must be looking for a job and not finding one). As it happens, surprisingly few people have been looking for work. Growth in the labor force has slowed to a crawl. This puts severe limits on future employment growth, and therefore on economic growth as well. And it is one link, but only one, between the decidedly mediocre growth of output and income and the 1993 increase in marginal tax rates.
<P>
The 1996 Economic Report of the President complains, ``some claimed these tax rate increases [e.g., in 1993] would do severe harm to the economy by creating disincentives for individuals to work and save. Again, these forecasts turned out to be false, just as did the earlier supply-side forecasts of rapid growth from tax reductions.'' It is difficult to imagine what numbers the President's economists have been looking at. If 3.9 per cent economic growth from 1983 to 1989 did not constitute ``rapid growth from tax reductions,'' then what are we to make of 2.3 per cent growth from Mr. Clinton's higher tax rates?
<P>
When it comes to ``disincentives for individuals to work,'' look at what the Economic Report itself says: ``The increase in the overall labor-force-participation rate has slowed since the late 1980s. . . . The stagnant participation rate has been one of the more enduring aspects of this expansion.'' Many secondary earners, mostly women, dropped out of the job market after the counterproductive, revenue-losing tax-rate increases of 1990 and 1993. The percentage of families with two or more earners, for example, dropped to 56.4 per cent in 1993 from 58.2 per cent in 1989, while the percentage with zero workers rose. This should come as no surprise. Assuming the first earner makes more than $140,000, the very first dollar of a second earner's income is now taxed at the same demoralizing 36 - 40 per cent rate as the first earner's last dollar.
<P>
More and more people are also retiring earlier. This too was quite predictable. The extra 1993 tax on Social Security benefits severely punishes older people who keep working, or who made the mistake of having saved enough to afford a modest retirement. The increase in the already punitive estate tax also undermines a major incentive for working and saving in later years.
<P>
In 1993, the earned-income tax credit increased the share of the loot given to those with incomes well above the poverty level. That too discouraged additional work and additional workers. Marginal tax rates on any extra income are now 50 - 75 per cent for two-thirds of EITC recipients.
<P>
The reduction in the supply of willing workers is what kept the measured unemployment rate low, despite the fact that employment has grown by only 1.3 per cent a year since 1991, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department demographers had forecast that the labor force would grow by 1.3 per cent a year in the 1990s, but it has not even grown by 1 per cent. If the number of job seekers had grown as rapidly as the demographic experts suggested, there would be a lot more people looking for work, and the unemployment rate would now be well above 8 per cent. If the labor force had grown as rapidly as in the Eighties, the unemployment rate would exceed 11 per cent.
<P>
What about ``disincentives . . . to save''? Since tax rates went up in 1993, personal saving has dropped to 4.2 per cent of after-tax income, down from 5.9 per cent in 1992. Measured in constant 1992 dollars, real personal saving was only $223.8 billion in 1995, compared with $310.5 billion ten years earlier. Increased tax rates on high-income individuals and on corporations directly reduced the amount of disposable income left to save, as well as reducing incentives to save.
<P>
Apologists for Clinton's economic policies often blame Alan Greenspan for the sluggish growth of output and income. Has the Fed been discouraging growth through excessively tight monetary policy? Hardly. Short-term interest rates have been much lower in the past three years than they ever were in 1983 - 89, in both nominal and real terms. In other words, the Fed was less accommodating in the 1980s than today, but we had higher growth then.
<P>
By the time of the November election, living standards will have gone nowhere but down for seven years. This is unprecedented. In the 49 years that figures on median family income have been collected, they never before declined for seven years. The worst economic performance in fifty years, as Mr. Clinton used to say, is arguably right now.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> conventional wisdom is that the Republican Party is the party of the rich, while the Democrats represent the working class. But under Ronald Reagan's policies working-class Americans prospered, and under Clintonomics, the working class has lost ground. Only the rich have prospered on Clinton's watch.
<P>
During the 1980s, each uptick in the share of total income going to the wealthy was trumpeted on the front page of every major newspaper as evidence that the Reaganomics had created an era of greed and income disparity. And indeed, the wealthy were better off. The share of total income going to the top 20 per cent of households rose by 2.4 per cent, and the share going to the top 5 per cent rose by 1.9 per cent during the Reagan Administration. Yet during just the first two years of the Clinton Administration (the latest data go only through 1994), the top 20 per cent increased their share of the income pie as much as they did during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration. And the top 5 per cent have done even better, increasing their share of total income by 2.5 per cent.
<P>
In fact, the share of total income gained by the top 20 per cent of households hit an all-time high in 1994 (49.1 per cent), as did the share going to the top 5 per cent (21.2 per cent). The top quintile's share of total income was significantly lower in every year of the Reagan Administration than in either of Clinton's first two. In 1988, the year under Reagan when the rich did the best, the top quintile received 46.3 per cent of total income and the top 5 per cent received 18.3 per cent. In other words, income gains in the 1980s were more evenly divided among the income classes than has been the case in the 1990s.
<P>
How can this be? Clinton's first priority after taking office was to raise taxes on the rich precisely in order to reduce income inequality. This is why the very centerpiece of his economic program was an increase in the top tax rate from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent -- to force the rich to pay more. Yet all the evidence thus far shows that income inequality became worse following the tax increase. Nevertheless after release of the latest income data, the <I>Washington Post</I> and other media outlets editorialized against the Republican Congress's proposed tax cut because it ``would add to what is already so disturbing a trend'' of greater income inequality.
<P>
At least Reagan could argue that although the rich got richer, so did everyone else. Real median family income (in 1994 dollars) rose from $36,825 when he took office to $40,890 by the time he left. Furthermore, the average real income of those in the bottom quintile of households rose from $7,954 to $8,391, and the income of those in the second lowest quintile rose from $18,856 to $20,797. The third and fourth quintiles also saw significant increases.
<P>
By contrast, median family income has been flat during the Clinton Administration. During its first two years, real median family income averaged $38,343, down from $38,632 in 1992 and well below the level when Reagan left office. The income of the bottom quintile has averaged $7,681 and that of the second quintile has averaged $19,176. In 1992 these groups averaged $7,698 and $19,205, respectively. However, the average income of the top quintile rose from $96,240 in 1992 to $105,945 in 1994, and that of the top 5 per cent went from $152,751 to $183,044.
<P>
Other measures of income also show that the non-rich have not benefited at all from Clinton's policies. Workers, for example, are no better off today than they were when Clinton took office. In January 1993 real average weekly earnings for private-sector workers were $253.76 (in 1982 dollars). In May 1996, the most recent month for which there are data, real earnings were $253.80. That works out to a real pay increase of just one cent per week for every year Clinton has been in office.
<P>
History teaches us that it is virtually impossible to reduce the share of income going to the wealthy by raising their taxes. The reason is that the negative economic effects of raising marginal tax rates reduce everyone's incomes. The only way to raise the share of income going to the non-wealthy is by increasing the rate of economic growth. The source of the wealthy's gains during the Clinton years has been lower interest rates and a strong stock market.
<P>
Workers, meanwhile, have seen their incomes squeezed by Clinton's policies -- the prosperity has not trickled down. Only an aggressive pro-growth policy of supply-side tax cuts and less regulation will improve their living standards. Contrary to conventional wisdom, throughout American history a rising tide really has lifted all boats. Clinton's austerity has succeeded in lifting only the yachts of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers.

<FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><font size=+1>RODUCTIVITY</font> growth has been only 0.5 per cent a year on Bill Clinton's watch, the lowest rate through an Administration since Herbert Hoover. Worker productivity since 1993 has been only about one-third the rate under Ronald Reagan (1.3 per cent) and has even been well below the rate under George Bush (0.9 per cent).
<P>
We care about productivity rates because this is what drives the real wages of workers. Given the anemic productivity rates since 1993, it should hardly be surprising that the growth of average real (inflation-adjusted) labor compensation under Clinton has also been very low. This is the primary reason, even with low unemployment and inflation, why many Americans are concerned about their economic future. This is the primary pocketbook issue on which Clinton's record is vulnerable.
<P>
The average rate of worker-productivity growth has declined somewhat unevenly for thirty years, interrupted only by a temporary upswing during the Reagan years. The reasons for this long-term decline are not fully understood by economists, let alone policymakers, but the following conditions are at least partly responsible:
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Too many young workers have low job skills, despite a long-term increase of real spending per student by over 30 per cent a decade. The average composite SAT score peaked in 1963, declined almost continuously through 1980, and has since been roughly stable.<br>
2. Taxes as a percentage of GDP have increased by about 5 points beginning with the Vietnam War and the expansion of the welfare state in the mid 1960s.<br>
3. The costs of health, safety, and environmental regulation and of civil litigation increased sharply beginning in the early 1970s.<br>
4. The net national saving rate has declined sharply over the past 15 years, reflecting the combination of a decline in the private saving rate and an increase in the federal deficit. The private sector has been able to maintain a somewhat higher investment rate only by a substantial increase in borrowing from foreigners.</blockquote>
<P>
President Clinton did not create these conditions, but he should be judged by what, if anything, he has done to alleviate them.
<P>
As it has turned out, the Clinton Administration and, more generally, the national Democratic Party, has been an enemy of the very types of policies that are necessary to increase productivity growth. Let me count the ways:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In response to the teachers' unions, Clinton has opposed school vouchers, even in the District of Columbia (where his daughter attends a private school). In response to the industrial unions, Clinton proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage (which reduces the opportunity for on-the-job training) and opposed a bill that would have relaxed the restriction on ``quality circles'' in non-union firms.<br>
 -- At almost every decision point, Clinton has sided with the current beneficiaries of federal spending rather than with present and future taxpayers. Both Bush and Clinton addressed the deficit more by increasing taxes than by reducing domestic spending. As a consequence, the top marginal rate on earnings was increased from 28 per cent to 42 per cent. For any given reduction in the deficit, however, the economic benefits of reduced spending have proved to be much higher than the benefits of higher tax revenues. In other words, it matters a lot <I>how</I> we balance the budget.<br>
 -- Fortunately, there has been relatively little new regulatory legislation on Clinton's watch; indeed a substantial deregulation of agriculture and telecommunications was approved (though without much of an Administration role). But Clinton and congressional Democrats blocked other regulatory-reform measures. Of greater concern, Clinton seems to have given the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration almost free rein. For example, the FDA has proposed major restrictions on tobacco marketing with no clear statutory authority.
 -- In response to the trial lawyers, Clinton vetoed bills to restrict shareholder suits and to reform product-liability law. The costly litigation explosion is another factor in the deterioration in productivity.<br>
 -- Senior members of the Administration have demonized corporate CEOs, the banking industry, drug firms, the insurance industry, oil companies, the medical profession, and tobacco firms. Clinton has jeopardized foreign investment by threatening to extend U.S. law to the operations of parent companies abroad. Which firm, industry, or profession is next?<br>
 -- Clinton opposes proposals to reduce the tax bias against saving and investment while refusing to even acknowledge the multi-trillion dollar implicit debt of the Social Security system.</blockquote>
<p>

In sum, the damage done by President Clinton is not primarily that productivity growth has declined on his brief watch. It is that with few exceptions, he has actively opposed the measures that the United States must take to reverse this disturbing trend. Ironically, Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992 issuing a challenge to the American people to have ``the courage to change.'' Now he is the adversary of the very changes in policies that are imperative to build a prosperous future for our children. On this record, Clinton has no claim to the mantle of compassion.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>F</font> Woody Allen was right that 90 per cent of life is just showing up, then Bill Clinton has a stellar fiscal record. The federal budget deficit has tumbled from $255 billion in 1993 to a projected $117 billion this year. And Clinton was there when it happened. But that just about covers the extent of his involvement. For evidence of this, let's review the Clinton record over the past three and a half years:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton announces his new Administration's first economic program: a $16-billion ``fiscal stimulus.'' The spending package is later abandoned by the Democratic Congress as too fiscally irresponsible.
<P>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton wins passage of his $250-billion tax hike -- which New York Sen. Pat Moynihan accurately describes as ``the largest tax increase in world history.'' It passes both houses of Congress without a single Republican vote. The package contains approximately $2 of new spending for every $1 of new taxes.
<P>
 -- In September 1993 the Clinton White House lobbies to defeat the bi-partisan Penny - Kasich deficit-reduction bill, which would have cut federal spending and the deficit by $90 billion over five years.
<P>
 -- In January 1994 Bill and Hillary Clinton unveil ``ClintonCare.'' The proposed hostile federal takeover of one-seventh of the U.S. economy would add at least $75 billion to the deficit over the next six years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
<P>
 -- In September 1994 the President furiously lobbies liberal Democrats in Congress to oppose a Balanced Budget Amendment -- a measure supported by 75 per cent of the American public. Labor Secretary Robert Reich is a little too honest when he confirms most Americans' suspicions about this Administration: ``The President is against simply balancing the budget.''
<P>
 -- In October 1994 the President signs into law his $30-billion ``crime bill.'' The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> describes the legislation as a ``once-in-a-lifetime  federal spending bonanza'' containing ``a vast array of new social programs'' including federally funded exotic-dance classes, sensitivity-training courses, and midnight-basketball leagues. The cost of the Clinton bill has to be shaved after the Democratic House of Representatives rejects the original version as too expensive.
<P>
 -- In January 1995 Bill Clinton submits a 1996 budget plan that calls for $12 trillion of spending over the next seven years and $200-billion deficits for as far as the eye can see. Even <I>Washington Post</I> reporter David Broder blasts the document as a ``symbol of Clinton's failed leadership.'' Because of the debt Clinton is adding, writes Broder, ``the annual net interest is projected to climb from $198 billion in 1993 to $270 billion in 1997 -- when it will, for the first time, be larger than the projected defense budget.''
<P>
 -- In March 1995 Clinton again helps torpedo the Balanced Budget Amendment -- this time by strong-arming five Democratic senators, who had campaigned as champions of the amendment -- to flip-flop and vote no.
<P>
 -- In June 1995, under pressure from the GOP Congress, Bill Clinton submits a new, revised budget proposal. It still doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In July 1995 the Clinton White House begins its successful ``Medi-scare'' strategy to undermine public support for a GOP plan to rein in stampeding Medicare costs. Even the <I>Washington Post</I> editorializes that the Clinton Administration has become a gang of ``medagogues.'' On Medicare and Medicaid, the White House is ``engaged in an irresponsible campaign based on distortion and fear.''
<P>
 -- In October 1995 Bill Clinton confirms what most of the public is already painfully aware of: ``I raised your taxes too much.''
<P>
 -- In December 1995 Bill Clinton vetoes the historic balanced-budget legislation enacted by the Republican Congress -- listing 82 reasons why it cuts too much spending. He complains of cuts in everything from foreign aid to corporate welfare.
<P>
 -- Later that month Bill Clinton releases his unprecedented third and then fourth budget proposals of the year. But they <I>still</I> don't balance the budget.
<P>
 -- In February 1996 Bill Clinton releases a $1.65-trillion 1997 budget that calls for $360 billion in added spending, or $3,100 per American household, over the next seven years. Then with a straight face he tells the nation that ``the era of big government is over.'' Oh, and the proposal <I>still</I> doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In April 1996 Clinton signs the GOP budget after the Republicans capitulate to his demands and add back some $10 billion of deficit spending.
</blockquote>
<P>
<font size=+3>W</font><font size=+1>HEW!</font> This really is a pillar of fiscal integrity we have in the White House. The point of this demoralizing three-and-a-half-year budget odyssey is this: The Clinton Administration cannot credibly claim credit for the reduction in the deficit unless the nation is suffering from a severe case of fiscal amnesia.
<P>
On at least three separate occasions in 1993 and 1994 -- the fiscal-stimulus package, ClintonCare, and the crime bill -- the Administration attempted to make the deficit situation worse, but amazingly was constrained by a Democratic Congress. On four other instances, bipartisan deficit-reduction initiatives were rebuked by Clinton. 
<P>
Since the Republicans took control of Congress in November of 1994, Clinton's fiscal obstructionism and demagoguery has been elevated to Olympic levels. The Republicans' budget-balancing plan was thrashed almost daily by the White House as ``mean-spirited,'' ``radical,'' ``harmful to children, the poor, and the environment,'' and ``just plain wrong for America.'' Yet in typical Clinton fashion, one day the budget is denounced as ``wrong for America,'' the next day the White House is staging a Rose Garden press conference claiming credit for the impressive first-year deficit reduction that the ``mean-spirited'' Republican budget produced.
<P>
So how much of the credit for the impressive drop in the deficit this year does the Administration deserve? The standard spin from the White House these days is that the ``enormous progress'' on the deficit vindicates the Clinton ``$500-billion deficit-reduction'' package of 1993. It turns out we can roughly calculate how much of the deficit decline is attributable to Clinton, and how much to Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress. Back in April 1995, just before the Republicans released their seven-year balanced-budget plan, the CBO announced that Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would produce $211 billion of red ink in 1996.
<P>
Instead, the deficit will fall to $117 billion. That's a $94-billion improvement -- almost entirely attributable to the GOP budget. Over the entire seven-year budget window, the Gingrich plan chops a shade over $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) of deficit spending from the Clintonomics baseline.
<P>
The budget deficit would be lower still had it not been for Bill Clinton's vetoes of Republican Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and appropriations bills. Those vetoes canceled an estimated $10 to $15 billion in budget cuts for 1996 -- savings that would have been magnified in future years.
<P>
GOP partisans can hardly exult in the deficit story of the past five years, however. Despite this Administration's sorry record of fiscal obstructionism, there is still the unarguable underlying fact that Bill Clinton's overall fiscal performance has been far superior to that of his predecessor, George Bush.
<P>
All the deficit reduction of the last three years is simply recovering the lost ground of the early 1990s -- Richard Darman's reign of fiscal terror. It is a popular myth that George Bush inherited a budget crisis ``baked in the cake'' from Ronald Reagan. When Reagan left the White House in January 1989, the deficit was $150 billion and forecast to decline gradually till it reached $110 billion in 1995. The CBO concluded that continued deficit reduction would occur if Bush (and Darman) simply left fiscal policy on automatic pilot.
<P>
Instead, we got Bush's infamous reversal on ``no new taxes'' and a 1990 budget package that dealt a body blow to an already ailing economy and sent the deficit into the stratosphere. From 1990 to 1995 the national debt soared $622 billion above the levels anticipated in 1989. Richard Darman's enduring legacy to the nation is this: 1990 - 94 was the worst five-year deficit performance since World War II. Now really, how hard has it been for Clinton to improve on that rotten fiscal record?
<P>
The Left is now again busy trying to rewrite history to suggest that the Bush 1990 and the Clinton 1993 tax hikes contributed mightily to the decline in the deficit. The top marginal income-tax rate has risen by 50 per cent -- from 28 per cent in 1989 to 42 per cent this year. Yet federal revenues grew faster in the 1980s with Reagan's substantial across-the-board tax cut than during the 1990s with these two giant tax hikes.
<P>
Overall real federal revenues (1982 to 1989) grew by 24 per cent during the seven-year period after the Reagan tax cuts took full effect. But (as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget Office) overall federal revenue growth from 1990 through 1997 will be only 18.5 per cent. If federal revenues had grown in the 1990s at only the pace they did after the Reagan tax cuts, federal receipts in 1996 would be almost $50 billion greater and the deficit would be one-third smaller.
<P>
Income-tax receipts after adjusting for inflation rose by 16.3 per cent in the seven years after the full Reagan tax cut. Income-tax receipts will have climbed by 16.1 per cent in real terms in the seven years since 1990.
<P>
So where is the evidence that these tax increases actually raised revenues?
<P>
If tax hikes don't account for the lowering of the deficit, what does? America's victory in the Cold War. (The extent of Bill Clinton's contribution to that effort was in obtaining draft deferments.) In the 1980s the nation invested $2 trillion on the Reagan military build-up to vanquish the Evil Empire -- perhaps the only truly successful government program of the last half-century. Now we are rapidly demilitarizing, creating a vast budget windfall. Over the past eight years the Pentagon's budget has fallen by almost $110 billion in real terms. How's this for a coincidence: that's almost precisely how much the real budget deficit has fallen over that period.
<P>
Normally in post-war years the United States Government not only moves immediately back to a balanced-budget regime, but cuts taxes and then runs budget <I>surpluses</I> to begin paying off the wartime debt. In the post - Cold War 1990s none of those things have happened. No tax cut. No balanced budget. No liquidation of the debt. Instead defense cutbacks have helped camouflage a sustained non-defense spending build-up. Between 1989 and 1995, real defense outlays have fallen by one-third, while everything else we spend money on -- from peanut subsidies to the Mark Hatfield Memorial Courthouse in Portland -- has climbed by $300 billion, or 30 per cent. Last year federal spending on non-defense programs consumed 18 per cent of national output, a larger share than at any previous time in American history. The nanny state is alive and well in America.
<P>
So much so that we can now add the most recent and depressing entry to the Clinton fiscal chronology:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In July 1996 the CBO announces that the Clinton deficit-reduction honeymoon is over. After 1997, the Clinton baseline outlook steadily deteriorates in every year for the next decade. Then the government's finances implode. Runaway entitlement expenditures -- particularly for Medicare and Medicaid -- ravage the budget. The CBO predicts that unless transfer payments are curtailed the nation faces a future of ``unsustainably high levels of federal borrowing,'' with the national debt ascending relentlessly from 60 per cent of national output today, to 150 per cent by 2025.</blockquote>
<P>
Thank you, Bill Clinton.

<FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><font size=+1>ILL</font> Clinton's 1993 tax package included the biggest hike in income-tax rates since Herbert Hoover's misguided tax increase in 1930. Supporters of the tax hike argued that the higher taxes on the rich would bring in much-needed revenues to reduce the budget deficit, and would also help close the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor.
<P>
Yet the most remarkable feature of the Clinton tax hike has been its failure to generate additional revenues. Even liberals, after all, presumably do not favor higher tax rates just for the sake of punishing success. Do they? Yet consider the following: Taxes consumed 19.2 per cent of economic output (GDP) the year Reagan left office. Since that time, there have been two major tax increases, the Bush tax hike of 1990 and Clinton's record increase of 1993. The impact on tax collections? The Congressional Budget Office estimates revenues this year will total 19.1 per cent of GDP, down by one-tenth of a point.
<P>
The futility of higher tax rates can be seen by examining income-tax revenues as a percent of GDP. Higher income-tax rates were to be the major revenue raisers in both the Bush and the Clinton tax hikes, yet income-tax revenues have fallen from 8.6 per cent of GDP when Reagan left office to 8.5 per cent this year, according to the CBO. These numbers are particularly compelling since income-tax revenues typically rise over time as a percentage of GDP in countries with ``progressive'' tax systems, as even modest increases in income gradually push people into higher tax brackets. The Clinton Administration no doubt would point out that revenues fell under Bush and have risen in the last four years, but this pick-up in revenues is mainly a function of the business cycle and does not change the underlying fact that government is collecting less as a percentage of output even though (or rather, because) the top income-tax rate is 50 per cent higher today than it was at the end of the Reagan era.
<P>
The failure of income-tax-rate increases can also be confirmed by examining the growth of income-tax revenue in constant dollars. During the Reagan years, when tax rates were reduced twice, inflation-adjusted income-tax revenues rose an average of 2.2 per cent each year. In the post -  Reagan era, which has seen two massive tax-rate increases, revenue growth has slowed to 1.3 per cent annually. Once again, the White House would argue that this comparison does not distinguish between Bush and Clinton, but, since the two Presidents had virtually identical policies of raising tax rates on the rich, such a distinction would be meaningless.
<P>
Income-tax revenues also grew substantially faster in the 1960s after President Kennedy's 30 per cent across-the-board tax cuts than in the 1950s with tax rates as high as 90 per cent. In the 1950s real income-tax receipts were flat. Following the Kennedy tax cuts, the revenues increased at a 4.8 per cent clip. After LBJ's surtax, revenue growth again fell by more than half. There seems to be a pattern emerging here.
<P>
So if the Bush and Clinton tax increases failed to raise revenues, why has government borrowing declined by more than $100 billion since Clinton took office? Two reasons. First, large real cutbacks in the defense budget of nearly 6 per cent annually; and second, a slow down in the growth of inflation-adjusted domestic spending from the enormous 6.3 per cent annual average under George Bush to 2.5 per cent under Clinton. Yes, it's a sad but true fiscal fact that federal spending has been far more restrained during the Clinton Administration than it was during the Bush Administration. But both Presidents' attempts to gain revenues by raising tax rates have been utterly futile.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HERE</font>  was the nation's First Stepmother when, according to the best liberal opinion, the future of America's children was being destroyed by the passage of welfare reform? The welfare-rights coalition and Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman were frantically lobbying the White House for a presidential veto. In their effort to influence the President, NOW members even launched a hunger strike (and they might just have caught his eye if they had slimmed down). But while this pitched battle was going on, Hillary Clinton -- missing in action. 
<P>
Yet the First Lady, whose public life has been ostentatiously dedicated to the well-being of children, has curiously escaped being held to account by her liberal allies. She may have persuaded them that she was pleading their case behind closed doors, but it's more likely that Edelman and Co. recognize what one liberal advocate in Arkansas reluctantly concluded long ago: ``We learned not to expect anything of Hillary. What was the one thing she would go to the wall for? Bill's Presidency.'' 
<P>
Yet with the Administration deeply divided over whether or not to sign the welfare bill, there's little doubt that Hillary's influence would have been decisive. Richard Reeves enjoyed lunch at the White House with the Clintons recently and reported that the President glanced guiltily at Hillary to seek permission before ordering a piece of blueberry pie. If Hillary controls Bill's pastry consumption, she certainly could have prevented him from swallowing the distasteful gruel of welfare reform. But although Hillary has been committed to spending other people's money on behalf of liberal causes, she has been unwilling to spend Bill's political capital to advance the agenda. In the Clinton household, politics counts for more than principles and even friendship (just ask Lani Guinier).
<P>
Confronted with the First Lady's unprecedented unpopularity -- the latest polls show her favorability rating below sea level (30 per cent) -- one defender argues that Hillary makes us uncomfortable because she is so good. Ruth Rosen, professor of history at the University of California at Davis, explains that Hillary is ``the perfect scapegoat because she has a moral compass and is not afraid to follow it.''
<P>
In fact, Hillary's compass always pointed straight to the White House. Betsy Wright, Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor, speculates that the Clintons thought that Bill could win the Presidency from the time they married. Bill had the vision, Hillary provided the focus and discipline. When his mother had trouble accepting a daughter-in-law whom she regarded as a prickly, unattractive feminist, he reportedly explained: ``Look, Ma, I have work to do. I don't need to be married to a sex goddess.'' 
<P>
A politically successful partnership with a division of responsibility was formed from Clinton's early days as governor. Bill bobbed about in the centrist waters of Arkansas and joined the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in the mid Eighties. It fell to Hillary, with her collegiate history of liberal activism, to nail down the Democratic base. Hillary accordingly served on the national boards of the Legal Services Corporation, the Children's Defense Fund, and the leftist New World Foundation.
<P>
But her espousal of liberal causes was strictly for export. Back home she had shed her maiden name, thick glasses, 15 pounds, and opposition to capital punishment. In particular, her advocacy on behalf of neglected children was a wholesale, out-of-state operation. While she toiled on the national scene urging Congress to live up to its moral responsibilities, the child-welfare system in Arkansas became a national disgrace. Its comparative infant mortality rate increased during her husband's 12-year tenure. But national reputations are not made by small local improvements.
<P>
Following Bill Clinton's jarring defeat for re-election in 1980, Hillary was better able to protect her investment in him than in Whitewater. Having already reformed her feminist appearance, she went to work on her irritating tendency to aloofness and superiority. An aide to Governor Clinton explained, ``This is a very personal state. Now, for Clinton that empathy is natural. But Hillary learned how to project it.''
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size==1>UT</font> not convincingly. Her sense of superiority is still apparent. People aren't having trouble -- as Ann Lewis endlessly insists they are -- reconciling themselves to a new kind of First Lady who is independent, accomplished, and outspoken. The dislike of the First Lady has nothing to do with people's inability to adjust to ``the changing nature of women's roles'' or with any discomfort we mortals might feel when confronted by the noble and virtuous. People dislike the First Lady because they reasonably resent someone who believes herself to be morally superior to them even as she pursues power and status like the most cynical of politicians.
<P>
In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be influential and prominent without the scrutiny and accountability that politicians must endure. She wants to be viewed as having a successful, independent career while having traded on her influence and access as the governor's wife. Her formidable skills of advocacy are used to attack Bill's opponents, who can't fight back against his wife as they would against the President himself. Above all, she wants the rewards associated with success in the private sector while pursuing political advancement in the foundation world and public sector.
<P>
Hillary insists that pro-bono legal work is ``the heart and soul of the law,'' but her own work in the cause of legal aid or children's rights was either compensated or politically useful. The righteous Wellesley graduate who told her fellow students that the ``acquisitive, and competitive corporate life . . . is not the way of life for us'' earned $129,000 in directors' fees from Arkansas corporations. 
<P>
She notes in addition the burden she has carried to support the family. When questioned about apparent influence peddling, conflicts of interest, or cattle futures, she impatiently cites the enormous financial sacrifices the Clintons have made to permit Bill's public service. But while the Clintons were making these sacrifices for the common good in Arkansas, the state's taxpayers footed the bill for food, shelter, servants, and entertainment; the Arkansas state auditor estimated their upkeep cost at $750,000 annually.
<P>
Hillary bitterly resents being questioned about such matters. She has always hated the media and now believes the press is becoming ``the handmaiden of the Right,'' no less. But the press rises above it, and women journalists in particular would rather burnish the feminist icon than examine its calves of clay. We're told about the unswerving ``sense of mission'' that has kept Hillary too busy to respond cogently to accusations of improprieties. It's Hillary's ``do-good energy'' that makes her ``fierce and protective.'' 
<P>
These warm maternal qualities are not always evident to those who know her well. An admiring friend whose divorce Hillary handled confessed that she was fearful of her own attorney. ``I would never cross her,'' she declares. Hillary encouraged the media to investigate some alleged infidelities of George Bush during the 1992 campaign -- that ``sense of mission,'' no doubt. And her temper in general has been well documented. When she advised in her recent book that, in order to stay married, sometimes ``you have to bite your tongue,'' one can't help wondering if that's in order to improve her aim.
<P>
Fortunately, Hillary's brusque self-confidence trumped her pragmatism when it came to reforming the health-care system. This was one reform that wasn't about Bill; it was her baby, to be loved, cherished, and delivered on time. She was fighting not for ClintonCare but for Rodham Rx. Convinced that her efforts had produced a near-perfect product, she would brook no criticism and make no compromise. If Hillary Clinton had a dash of modesty, our health care would probably have been socialized. But she allowed the worst to be the enemy of the bad.
<P>
Despite her withdrawal into purdah, Hillary remains the motive force behind ideological liberalism in the White House and the Administration generally. She had a hand in the major liberal appointments, like that of Donna Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services. She has salted the agencies with her followers. And she is a presence who inspires awe and even fear in senior aides.
<P>
Her legal writings, her Arkansas practice, and her record in the world of legal activism all show her to be a devout believer in the power of government to transform human lives for the better. Her sense of mission, which this belief inspires, allows her to bend the rules -- whether in Whitewater or in organizing the White House Health Care Task Force -- with a clear conscience. She is one of nature's Commissars. Among New Democrats, that makes her a Lenin in a den of Daniels. But it is her ill fortune to come within a heartbeat of power in a conservative age of diminished expectations for centralized power and what government can achieve.
<P>
At first she resisted this truth and tried to push through a total restructuring of health care by the sheer power of presidential authority and her own self-confidence. But she was defeated. And just as after the 1980 Arkansas gubernatorial election, she learned from her defeat. Her prudent silence in the face of welfare reform is one evidence of a lesson learned. Another, as Ramesh Ponnuru  points out, is her return to reforming health care by a Fabian policy of gradualism. If Hillary has her way, health care will be socialized little by little, and we won't notice until the trap is sprung.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> June 22, 1994, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, to no fanfare whatsoever, issued Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 (IB 94-1). The bulletin applied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a 1974 law designed to protect pension funds from reckless managers. Section 404 of the law makes creating benefits for pension beneficiaries the ``exclusive purpose'' of pension investing. This is the part of ERISA that Reich's bulletin re-interpreted, saying pension-fund managers could consider both the interests of beneficiaries and secondary benefits to other parties when investing pension funds. A hard-to-follow exercise in bureaucratic minutiae? Well, yes. Insignificant? No. Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 was an opening shot in a Clinton Administration policy offensive potentially as radical in scope as its health-care plan, an attempt to tap into a portion of the nation's $3.5 trillion in private pension-money funds to advance its social agenda.
<P>
The re-interpretation of ERISA, and the supporting efforts surrounding it, exemplify the way the Clinton Administration has tweaked regulations and interpretations of law to make policy advances; the way its mid-level personnel has agitated for an agenda at odds with the Administration's public, centrist pose; and the cozy relationship between the Clinton Executive Branch and the activist Left. The Executive Branch and the larger federal bureaucracy by themselves -- without grandiose legislative proposals or high-profile public advocacy -- provide endless opportunities for prosecuting an ideological agenda and protecting the cold political interests of a President. This most political Administration has taken every opportunity afforded it, prospering in Washington's legal and bureaucratic thickets.
<P>
The Clinton Administration re-interpreted ERISA so as to clear the way for so-called Economically Targeted Investments (ETIs). A long-time favorite of the Left, the thrust of ETIs is to steer private pension funds to public purposes (investments in public housing, infrastructure projects, jobs programs, etc.). For the Left, ETIs are a handy way to control middle-class dollars -- diverting retirement funds from more profitable uses -- without an actual tax increase. Clinton, who promoted ETIs in Arkansas, included in his 1992 policy manifesto ``Putting People First'' a proposal for $80 billion of federal investment in social projects to be leveraged with public and private pensions. Once he took office, his Administration began to push the ETI agenda, beneath headlines and the notice of much of the public.
<P>
Assistant Labor Secretary Olena Berg banged the drums across the country for ETIs. A former board member of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which had already gone in big for social investments, she boasted that ``This is the beginning of a turning point.'' In February of 1994 she urged big investors, according to <I>Business Week</I>, ``to invest the dollars now held by pension funds in ways that create more jobs.'' HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, meanwhile, was setting up what he called a ``precedent-setting initiative to attract pension-fund investments to housing for low-income people''; six pension funds agreed to invest in affordable housing projects with $100 million in federal backing. After the Administration issued IB94-1 in June of 1994, it also set up a federal ``clearinghouse'' to showcase successful social investments. 
<P>
The pedigree of ETIs -- Miss Berg herself calls them ``a radical notion'' -- has been documented by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which has worked aggressively to expose the Clinton offensive on pensions. A moving force behind the idea is the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA), a socialistic spin-off of the radical Institute for Policy Studies. CPA has flacked tirelessly for ETIs at least since 1990. In the Clinton Administration, it finally had a sympathetic ear. A CPA conference on the idea in 1995 drew some half-dozen Administration participants. CPA's ``public capital program'' manager tells of working closely with Administration officials on ETIs. Indeed, the idea of a clearinghouse had been proposed by CPA, and the Administration initially even selected the organization as the contractor for the project.
<P>
All this has effectively been shut down by Rep. Jim Saxton (R., N.J.), vice chairman of the JEC, who sponsored a bill that passed by a wide margin, repealing Reich's IB 94-1 and abolishing the clearinghouse. The pension issue is a natural for the GOP, and Democrats sense it. But the feckless Sen. Nancy Kassebaum has sat on a companion bill in the Senate. Which is par for the course: the Administration pushing to the limits on behalf of its agenda, while Republicans pull up short on the counterattack. ``They're chillingly pragmatic about all this, realizing that they can't advance the liberal parts of their agenda publicly so they find imaginative ways to try to do it anyway,'' says one House aide. There have been a number of underground ways the Administration has continued a liberal march without much attention, manipulating the bureaucracy and advancing its agenda by stealth. If declaring the end of ``the era of big government'' is the Clinton Administration by day, this is it by night.
<P>
Take RU-486. Abortion is one of the issues on which Clinton can't leave the Left -- despite the ``rare'' rhetoric -- so he was eager to deliver on the ``abortion pill.'' In January of 1993 Clinton wrote HHS Secretary Donna Shalala -- FDA Commissioner David Kessler's boss -- a memo asking HHS to promote the ``testing, licensing, and manufacturing'' of the drug. Kessler had pre-emptively reacted to the pressure five weeks after the 1992 elections, unilaterally reversing Bush Administration policy. He wrote to RU-486's manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, prodding it to apply for approval in the U.S. (``further clinical trials may not be required,'' he added helpfully). Everybody all around got the hints -- Kessler doing Clinton's bidding to save his job, Roussel Uclaf doing Kessler's bidding to avoid future run-ins. RU-486 is slated for FDA approval as early as September, and the Clinton Administration will have provided America with the drug as surely as if it had sponsored legislation to do so. 
<P>
<font size=+3>F</font><font size=+1>EDERAL</font> departments, meanwhile, have become touchstones for the organized Left and agents for advancing a PC agenda otherwise seen only on college campuses. The EPA, for instance, is a breeding ground for self-perpetuating activism. Since 1993, according to a GAO report, grants awarded for workshops, conferences, and non-scientific studies -- mostly the province of environmental advocacy groups -- have nearly doubled, from roughly $130 million to about $250 million. The American Association of Retired Persons has received some $40 million in 23 different grants since 1993; the Environmental Defense Fund has grabbed $1.8 million. Meanwhile, despite an amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) stipulating that it wouldn't apply to domestic partners, the EPA includes domestic partners in its own leave plan. EPA chief Carol Browner proudly cited the policy in an e-mail celebrating June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month -- ``In Headquarters, and in some Regional Offices, activities are being organized by the Chapters of the Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees (GLOBE) of EPA. Please join them . . .''
<P>
More broadly, the Administration has made full use of the propaganda power of the executive branch (see Christina Hoff Sommers, next page). The Civil Service subcommittee of the House Reform and Oversight Committee under Rep. John Mica (R., Fla.) has documented an Administration effort to ``roll out'' a weekly message through the public-affairs offices of federal departments, including those in field offices nationwide. (Veterans Affairs, Labor, and the EPA seem to be heavily involved.) ``It's putting hundreds of government employees at work flacking for you all over the country,'' says a House aide. House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Clinger (R., Penn.) conducted a May hearing on the Administration's wide-ranging politicization of the federal bureaucracy: 
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- VA Secretary Jesse Brown included a long ``message'' on employees' check stubs. ``As I have been telling the nation's veterans organizations this summer,'' Brown wrote, ``the Administration's [budget] plan is much better for veterans and their families.''
<P>
 -- In February 1995 an internal EPA e-mail discussed how ``Enviros are looking for some help in the conference committee on unfunded mandates,'' and suggested what the agency could do to support their lobbying. 
<P>
 -- A state director of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management wrote a letter last year advising public-land constituents of the department's opposition to a GOP grazing bill and inviting them ``to come together to work for the health of the public lands and the long-term economic stability of the West.'' Cabinet Secretaries can certainly take positions on public issues, but their departments aren't supposed to be arms of a permanent political campaign.</blockquote> 
<P>
Unions have been an integral part of this campaign too. Federal public-employee unions were kept apprised of crucial early strategy meetings organized by the Treasury Department to prepare for the looming budget crisis in 1995 (the meetings, again, were uncovered by Saxton's Joint Economic Committee). Ordinarily, public-employee unions would be concerned about a government shutdown and Treasury's planned raid on their pension trust funds during it. Instead, the unions eagerly participated in the Administration's shut-down strategy. ``We will be '<B>ON THEIR CASE AND IN THEIR FACE</B>,''' the American Federation of Government Employees president wrote of GOP freshmen in an August 1995 letter to members, well in advance of any shutdown. ``The question is not whether we work, but in what kind of America we will work.'' The Administration has paid back the unions for their loyalty. The Office of Personnel Management provided names and home addresses of its employees -- a clear breach of their privacy -- to the unions representing them. Mica's subcommittee discovered an OMB letter confirming that other federal agencies would be doing the same. 
<P>
There is a certain virtuosity to all this. The Democrats simply are more comfortable with power than the Republicans. That's why the Clinton Administration can -- after some initial stumbles -- push and pull all the political levers like an expert lathe operator. Two other factors are at work as well. One is necessity. The political imperative in the current environment is to move, as Ralph Reed once famously said of the Christian Coalition, ``quietly, with stealth, under cover of night.'' The other is lack of scruple. The Administration reflects the Clintons' ruthlessness in pursuit of power. The theme of former Republican officials brought to Capitol Hill to testify on Clinton Administration practices is always: We never would have done that, we couldn't have gotten away with it. Well, for whatever reason, the Clinton Administration can. For Republicans, the reward for their virtue is in heaven. The reward for the Clintonites' shamelessness may well be in a second term.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OUNDED</font> in 1989, Ervin and Associates, a contracting firm based in Bethesda, Md., and specializing in affordable housing, more than tripled in size in its first five years. In July, 1994 its work was commended by Assistant Secretary for Housing Nicholas Retsinas in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Employment, Housing, and Aviation. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the company raised over $165,000 to help the families of HUD employees who lost their lives. On John Ervin's office wall hangs a framed picture of his staff with HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros to mark the occasion, and a letter from the Secretary notes, ``The HUD family will always be grateful for your kindness.''
<P>
Well, maybe not ``always.'' Ervin has filed a suit against the department claiming its rampant politicization is running him out of business. Specifically, Ervin charges that the head of HUD's housing division, Helen Dunlap, has steered lucrative federal contract awards -- known by industry types as ``honey pots'' -- to her ``contractors of choice,'' in keeping with her animus against white males. Since Miss Dunlap's political appointment in 1994, Mr. Ervin's federal contacts have been cut almost in half, and the firm has had to downsize its full-time staff from 47 to 23. Moreover, Ervin claims, HUD's employment practice reflects an institutional bias. HUD counters that Ervin is a ``disgruntled contractor'' and that safeguards prevent contract patronage. His suit is pending in D.C.'s district court, but briefs filed by Ervin and documents he has obtained from HUD highlight disturbing practices -- blatant hiring quotas, outright hostility to white males, and possibly favoritism in contracts -- that go unnoticed in the thicket of the federal bureaucracy. 
<P>
Mr. Ervin asserts he has been recommended for many contracts by so-called source evaluation boards -- panels of career civil servants that are meant to combat patronage -- only to see Helen Dunlap ``orchestrate'' efforts to ``bypass the normal procurement processes which are intended to prevent the very abuses'' Ervin is being subjected to. In one case, Ervin alleges Miss Dunlap awarded a $30-million asset-management contract to the purportedly ``disadvantaged'' firm Williams and Adley, breaching a prior contract which Ervin says HUD previously informed him was legally his. Following objections raised by Ervin and career housing-division employees, according to <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I>, the HUD inspector general launched an investigation into contract malfeasance by the housing division. Miss Dunlap was demoted from her political appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Operations.
<P>
Despite this, Helen Dunlap reportedly waged a power struggle with her replacement (a white male), holding duplicate staff meetings immediately after his and asserting that she was still in charge and didn't intend to surrender. And she apparently won; she inexplicably regained her jurisdiction over contract awards and, Mr. Ervin claims, vindictively blackballs his firm from obtaining such awards. ``They throw the fox out of the hen house and then let it back in,'' says Ervin.
<P>
This attitude carries over into the way Miss Dunlap manages her division. <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I> quotes one high-level HUD source who says Dunlap ``made many enemies after joining the department.'' According to anonymous moles in HUD, she refers to the men in her front office as ``TOMs,'' or ``Tired Old Males,'' and has said that ``the only fitting position for a male is a secretary.'' It is not without reason that some of these career employees have been known to call their office a ``white boys' hell.''
<P>
But discrimination is not confined to Helen Dunlap and HUD contracts. Department managers are ranked on how well they achieve cultural diversity within their divisions. They are given evaluations with ratings of Outstanding, Fully Successful, and Unacceptable; an ``outstanding'' manager ``takes actions and makes decisions regarding hiring, promotions, training, upward mobility, recommendations for selection, and other personnel or administrative matters that further the Department's . . . Affirmative Employment Program policies and foster diversity within the HUD workplace.'' In short, color over merit.
<P>
Internal hiring data obtained by John Ervin under the Freedom of Information Act indicate what close attention is paid to ``diversity.'' A chart produced by HUD breaks down each department division by race and gender, noting changes over a six-month cycle. From September 1995 to March 1996, for example, Miss Dunlap's Office of Housing severely cut white men from the better professional and administrative positions (professionals down 10 per cent compared to 1 per cent department-wide).
<P>
In a previous analysis by HUD for 1996, the department reported a ``manifest imbalance'' (representation ``substantially below'' the civilian labor force) within its housing division in professional Hispanic females, and administrative and technical white females. An accompanying chart entitled ``Internal Movement Numerical Objectives'' called for 90 ``planned'' division hirings -- 20 white females, 20 black females, 20 black males, 10 Hispanic males, 10 Hispanic females, 5 Asian males, and 5 Asian females. Figures for white males were nil.
<P>
What is most striking, however, is not that HUD uses quotas in its hiring and promotions, but that the basis for these quotas in divisions across the country appears to be the Civilian Labor Force statistics for Washington, D.C. That is, a district field office in, say, Kansas City must strive to reflect the demographic composition of D.C. workers (the city's population is over 70 per cent minority). Kansas City's HUD field office has a total of five employees at the professional level: three white males, two black males. In a HUD document titled ``Assessment of Underrepresentation,'' the department categorizes all employees by race and gender and suggests in a ``number needed'' column that Kansas City should hire two white women, two black women, and a male and female each of Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian derivation.
<P>
Interestingly, in every assessment of white-male underrepresentation spanning HUD's 10 regions and 79 field offices, there is no ``number needed'' advisement for more white males.
<P>
While Nelson Diaz, head of HUD's office of General Counsel, mandates an obligatory three-and-a-half hour ``sensitivity training'' seminar for his employees, he apparently could use a little of this himself. According to attendees at a September 22, 1993, meeting of field counsel, Mr. Diaz declared that there are ``too many white faces at HUD.'' Subsequently, attempts were made to remove John Dellera (who is white) as Assistant General Counsel for New York/New Jersey. ``I doubted that the reassignment was bona fide and suspected it was an unlawful attempt to coerce my resignation so that Nelson could appoint some political friend to the job,'' Dellera wrote friends. Diaz replaced Dellera with a female Hispanic -- the office was deficient in the Hispanic female professional category, according to HUD reports. 
<P>
If the department isn't violating the letter of the law after the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision -- which held that race preferences will receive ``the strictest judicial scrutiny'' and will ``seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment'' -- it certainly violates the spirit. Not that it seems to matter. A May 16, 1996 HUD report dismisses the decision: ``<I>Adarand</I> did not provide clear judicial precedent on the constitutionality of specific affirmative action/ set-aside programs.'' Until the Supreme Court more clearly defines its guidelines, John Ervin just hopes to stay in the black -- despite being a white male trying to do business with Helen Dunlap's HUD.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N THE</font> novel <I>Primary Colors</I>, a senior Democratic senator is having an interview with the Bill Clinton figure, called Jack Stanton. It is well along in 1992, after the revelations about Gennifer Flowers and the record of evading the draft. The senior statesman does not know quite what to make of this precocious candidate, who carries about him the pronounced scent of things disreputable. Stanton is good with ``the folks'' -- he thrives on the engagement with ordinary people in a campaign. And he makes a ``nice speech.'' But then the senator turns and says, ``I have never seen a politician carry so much trouble around with him. You're like that cartoon character . . . Pigpen. A permanent cloud of dirt follows him around.''
<P>
Or as the Greeks would have it, character is destiny. Bill Clinton's permanent cloud was no accident; it sprang from something in his character. And when that something was conveyed into the work of a new Administration, it produced the surprises that should have been, by then, no surprise: an Administration that took, as the defining measures of its first moments, positions its leaders had never acknowledged in public or sought to justify in the course of the campaign. A candidate who had offered himself as a New Democrat, more sensitive on social issues, took as his first dramatic initiative an advanced position on gay rights, including gays in the military. A candidate who had lamented abortions, with a vow to make them ``rare'' as well as legal, moved on his first day in office -- in fact, moved even before he was sworn in -- to sign executive orders that would sweep away every inhibition on abortion in the federal service. The subsequent stories of Whitewater and Travelgate, of billing records curiously lost and rediscovered, of thuggish aides commandeering files from the FBI -- all of it plays out the script of characters straining their meager wit at the project of concealment rather than the task of governing. Indeed, it might be said that the project of concealment was what knitted this team together as its binding purpose. The first thing that must be understood then about Bill Clinton and the bully pulpit is that his Administration was constituted on premises that could not be expressed in public; and the principal genius of his staff was expended in covering up the incidents in his past that would imperil his moral claim to govern.
<P>
In June of 1993, I was at dinner with a seasoned Republican congressman, a man much liked on both sides of the aisle, and he remarked that, after the first, rocky months of Clinton's Presidency, his constituents had seen through him. Or they saw him clearly as he was. And what, I asked, did they see? ``That he is a man who will lie to them,'' he said, ``as readily as he will look at them.'' Three years later, when a jury in Little Rock handed down the first convictions of people close to the Clintons, a young reporter could remark on television that this event, though jolting, would have no measurable effect on the public standing of the President. For the public, he said, had long ago ``discounted'' Mr. Clinton's veracity. That is to say, a large portion of the public has absorbed now, with a serene acceptance, that Bill Clinton is an affable, incorrigible liar, but they have concluded that nothing in his vices threatens any public harm. In one recent survey, about 54 per cent of the public did not think that Bill Clinton could be considered ``honest and trustworthy.'' But the same surveys also reported that about 62 per cent think he has honesty and integrity enough to serve as President. There has evidently been a scaling down. The public has apparently absorbed those premises that were the hallmarks of ``modernity'': that there may be a separation between politics and morality, between private character and public office, and that a man overflowing with vices may nevertheless have considerable virtues as a public man.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T</font> became the standard refrain for a while among the Democrats that Clinton's personal life had nothing to do with his competence to deal with his public functions. But that argument quietly evaporated when Paula Jones filed her suit over sexual harassment. For since the outcry over Anita Hill in 1991, it had become a staple of the Left that sexual harassment deserved to be treated seriously, as a wrong claiming a high place in the public concern. With that sentiment kindling, there was a willingness to call forth the indignation of the public when the accusations broke over Sen. Bob Packwood. But when Paula Jones filed her own complaint, the Democrats were compelled to fall mute. They could no longer rail against Packwood and insist on the high significance of his offenses without sharpening the accusation against their own sitting President. It remained for Packwood to be removed from office by an Ethics Committee dominated by his own party. But the experience was quite enough to establish that Clinton's ``private'' conduct had a deeper public resonance after all. The need to defend Clinton induced his party to recede from an issue that it regarded as central, not peripheral, to the public business. His private troubles did indeed disarm or impair his party in addressing what it thought to be public matters of moral consequence.
<P>
Yet, as Madison said, if men were angels there would be no need for government. And a public steeped in Christianity has made its allowances for the sinful. (An echo sounds from a lyric of Stephen Sondheim: ``And as for being saintly, even faintly . . . no. But who needs Albert Schweitzer when the lights are low?/And oh, oh, oh, can that boy f -- oxtrot.'') At times it may indeed be true that the people needed urgently in a public mission are not virtuous in all things. That Churchill and Grant were heavy drinkers did not diminish the public need for them when their personal gifts marked them out for a mission that they, distinctly, could perform. If an inspired political man was able to summon the support of the public for a policy of putting abortion ``in the course of extinction,'' the pro-lifers would not be likely to desert him, if it turned out that his private life showed embarrassing lapses. And on the other side, we should not be shocked that the people who are determined to preserve unconstrained rights of abortion in America are quite as determined to cling to Bill Clinton even though his personal life could sustain, by itself, the tabloids at the supermarket.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>LL</font> of that we understand. And all of that we could readily grant: If we could accept Clinton's public purposes, we too might be able to share an urbane laugh over his character. But in his case there is a precise connection between his character and the political culture he represents: his personal libertinism reflects the core of what can be taken these days as liberal jurisprudence -- the notion of the ``autonomous self,'' unencumbered by moral restraints, which seeks, as its first freedom, sexual freedom, and as its primary legal support, the right to an abortion. In the ``culture war,'' the moral tradition is set against the ethic of that class that now controls the media, the universities, and the courts; and for all his faults, Bill Clinton is the exquisite reflection of that ethic and that class. In what other Administration could we find a highly placed officer, the deputy general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services, advancing the proposal for gay marriage, because it would ``expose and denaturalize the historical construction of gender at the heart of marriage''? A biped who makes these sounds can find its habitat only in a Democratic Administration. The Left on the campuses may wince when Clinton glides with the public wind and rejects gay marriage. But they are tolerant of his political weaving because they understand that he could never have been elected as a man of the modern American Left.
<P>
That difference, between the character of Clinton's policies and the character of his public rhetoric, is the measure of his considerable skill as a political man. He presides over an Administration of the post-McGovern Democrats, yet all that is happily overlooked by Middle America as he plays, with a flourish, on the chords of conventional morality. But how does he do it? How is he believable even for a moment when he strikes moral poses and presumes to engage in moral teaching?
<P>
``It should not fly, but behold! It does fly.'' He should have not the slightest standing to teach anything of moral consequence in public; and yet: he stands and he teaches. Indeed, the logic of his situation is that he cannot do otherwise without appearing defensive and giving the game away. One observer pointed out that Clinton was raised in a gambling town, where he learned early on the art of bluffing, or presenting the ``poker face.'' With his record, he is the last person to be preaching to young people about the virtues of chastity, and yet he preaches. As a man who evaded his obligations to serve in the military, it is clear that he cannot summon the least moral authority to send anyone else into combat. But of course, as Commander-in-Chief, he must be able to do just that. And his strength as a public man seems to reside precisely in his cheekiness, his unflagging willingness to brazen it out.
<P>
It is remarked, of course, that Franklin Roosevelt presided over a global war even though he himself had never served in the military. And among present-day Republicans, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm did not serve, though they were of age during the war in Vietnam. Still, there is something different about a man who used every stratagem to avoid his obligation. There is a moral point here that deserves to be respected even by people who feel an affinity with Clinton over Vietnam: There is a kind of covenant society must have with the men who honored the claims of their own government, and accepted their obligation to serve in the military. They accepted those duties at a certain hazard to themselves, and many of them died. In the aftermath, we may have good reason to wish we had sent none of them into a war that did not command the conviction of the leaders who were directing it. But part of the covenant with the men who served -- to use language closer to the ground -- is that we don't make jerks of them. And that we emphatically do when we show a willingness to honor a man who prospered because he was not foolish enough to risk himself as they did. A public that elects Clinton is engaging in a gesture of contempt for the men who served, and veterans who voted for him are engaging in a gesture of self-contempt.
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size=+1>UT</font> gamely putting all of that aside, what was Clinton to teach as he took hold of the bully pulpit? What was left? Could we imagine the scene as it must have been at Yale, over twenty years ago, as Bill Clinton, Robert Reich, and their friends would stay up in bull sessions, flexing their powers of conjecture, pondering the ways in which they might lead the country into bold paths of reform once the levers of power were put in their hands, as surely they would be? Could we imagine the moment of insight? ``We are going to come out against children smoking!'' Or: ``We are going to come out against dead-beat dads!'' Or: ``We are going to come out, forthrightly, unequivocally, against violence, and especially against the freedom to shoot people with assault weapons!''
<P>
That could hardly have been the vision that marked their dreams. But it may be the only recipe that is available to the generation that resolved long ago that there were no transcendent moral truths, particularly any truths grounded in ``nature.'' This group can rise to moral teaching mainly by sounding the themes of public pieties, with proposals so wanting in controversy that they would mesh even with the social policies of Joseph Goebbels and his party. They too had an ambitious scheme of allowances for children, and they were headed by a man who was an exemplary figure to the young in his shunning of tobacco. Still, even in this domain, the authority of Mr. Clinton must be equivocal. When he enjoins upon teenagers a life of chastity and abstinence, it clearly cannot be because he would respect that life in principle. In fact, it is hard to see why Mr. Clinton would not approach the problem of teenage smoking in the way that his Administration approaches teenage sexuality: After all, some youngsters will be determined to smoke anyway, as some youngsters will be determined to have sexual relations, and so we might as well provide them with cigarettes containing filter tips.
<P>
But of course even the health of children reaches its limit as a moral concern when it runs up against the interests of Mr. Clinton's core constituency. The President's solicitousness for children may be nearly maternal, but it evaporates dramatically when it comes to those children, with legs dangling out of the birth canal, who are the targets of ``partial-birth'' abortions. That children may become hooked on nicotine has become, for Mr. Clinton, a high public concern. That they may have their skulls crushed and their brains suctioned out, if it suits the interests or ``mental health'' of the women bearing them, is an injury that does not register. For in the presence of a trumping political interest, that infant simply does not register as a real being, capable of sustaining pain.
<P>
In the meantime, the editors of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> carefully unfold, over several years, the record of Whitewater, the Rose Law Firm, Webster Hubbell, Filegate. What is revealed is the pattern the editors characterize as ``Arkansas mores.'' The academic degrees may be from Yale, but the style of politics and moral fastidiousness is really Dogpatch U.S.A. But even the editors, worldly as they are, begin to show their puzzlement: The record unfolds and deepens, and yet it triggers no moral outrage in the public. That absence of reaction may itself be the news: namely, that we are dealing with a public shaped now by the changes of the Sixties and the public teaching of <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>. This may be a public coarsened now in its moral sensibility; and there may be nothing any longer in Clinton's repertoire that could stir this public to outrage.
<P>
We may well recall that old joke about the lawyer who is promised unbounded success in business and love, to be paid for in the end by the delivery of his soul. And he asks, guardedly, ``What's the catch?'' The accomplishment of Bill Clinton is that he has made the country into one large lawyer-joke. Clinton has marked off the record of an incorrigible liar, faithless to his wife, who cannot be trusted to honor any law beyond his own interest -- and the public says, ``Yes -- but what is the problem?''
<P>
And yet, it may be said on behalf of Mr. Clinton that he is one of the few men on the scene who is suited to the political pulpit, because he is possessed of the most genuine interest in engaging people, wherever he finds them, and joining the argument. On the Republican side he is matched by the likes of Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett, and Pat Buchanan. And when Mr. Clinton goes to church, one has the hunch that he goes because he knows he needs it. But his comings and goings in church also seem to offer another measure of the religious sensibility of our time. Apparently, the religious sense abroad in the land is of a God whose capacity for forgiveness is boundless, and whose demand for contrition is optional. What seems to be left out, conspicuously, is a God who would invite some serious testimony about the plan to amend one's life and confirm it in a new cast. If that understanding of God were dominant in the public mind, people might be moved to ask of Bill Clinton some rather searching questions. But it may be as some of us have begun to suspect, that Mr. Clinton is indeed a representative man of his age. He is, as he is, scaled to the current moral sensibility of the public, and to the notion of God that most people in the country think they can afford.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton promised zero tolerance for those in government who ``cut corners and cut deals.'' But less than three years later the Justice Department cut a highly questionable deal with Arthur Coia, president of the mob-ridden Laborers International Union of North America, whose 700,000 members for the most part fill low-skilled construction jobs.
<P>
Corruption in the Laborers Union is an old and open book. As far back as 1978 a Justice Department report to the White House contended that the Chicago mob dominated Angelo Posco, then president of LIUNA, and in 1986 the President's Commission on Organized Crime, pointing to the looting of union benefit funds by the mob, death threats, and murders of opposing candidates, urged the Justice Department to file civil-racketeering charges. In 1988, the FBI announced a RICO investigation of LIUNA.
<P>
On November 4, 1994, the Justice Department delivered a draft of its 212-page RICO complaint to the Laborers: the key demand, Coia must go. The complaint chronicled a massive web of corruption that had continued for decades, with capos from an assortment of crime families either running locals directly or installing their appointees. LIUNA, it said, has been ``continuously and systematically controlled, exploited, and dominated in the conduct of its affairs by the Cosa Nostra.''
<P>
The complaint was unsparing concerning Coia personally. Four consecutive presidents of the union, including Coia, were ``controlled and influenced by organized-crime figures.'' Indeed, according to the complaint, Coia had tried (unsuccessfully) to replace the previous president in 1986 because he believed ``that [Angelo] Fosco's conduct harmed LIUNA and <I>the Cosa Nostra's control of LIUNA</I>'' (italics added). From 1986 to July 1994, the complaint charged, Coia had conspired with the Todaro crime family of Buffalo to transfer training funds of upstate New York locals to Buffalo, where the money would be used for the benefit of Cosa Nostra families and associates. (They were foiled when the victim-locals protested and a court upheld them against Coia.) Some of the material was old but nonetheless telling, like the 1981 indictment of Coia's father (who, as secretary-treasurer of the union, was second in command), New England mob boss Raymond Patriarca, and Coia himself for racketeering and taking bribes from an insurance swindler: it fizzled when the judge ruled the statute of limitations had expired.
<P>
Despite the damning indictment, within three months Justice had cut a deal: Coia could stay. In fact, Coia would be Justice's subcontractor to clean up the  union -- giving the ``appearance,'' in the delicate phrasing of Bill McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, of putting the fox in charge of guarding the chicken coop. Why did Justice make such an unprecedented arrangement? The official explanation is that the government saved money that would otherwise have been wasted in lengthy litigation, and that Coia himself -- who was more knowledgeable? -- could root out the mob more efficiently. Indeed, Justice professed great pride in this pioneering method of dealing with union corruption, and Attorney General Janet Reno cited it as a model for future racket busting.
<P>
There is no doubt that Coia had wielded a canny combination of carrot and stick. He threatened an all-out fight in the courts if he personally were pushed out. Showing he meant business, he hired the firm of Williams & Connolly, which also represents President Clinton on Whitewater, to represent him in his negotiations with Justice. To represent LIUNA he hired Robert Luskin, himself a former Justice Department official. Luskin made an unusual offer on Coia's behalf: the union would hire him and a contingent of former FBI investigators to root out corruption. Moreover, Coia agreed to a consent decree acknowledging significant corruption in the union (which he had previously denied) that gave the Justice Department the option, until 1998, of putting LIUNA under trusteeship if it was not satisfied with Coia's progress.
<P>
Did Justice have other inducements to keep Coia in place? What has raised eyebrows is Coia's role as one of Clinton's most important political and financial allies. Coia has co-chaired a series of fund-raising dinners for the Democrats, each of which has raised millions of dollars. In 1994 alone, LIUNA contributed over a million dollars to Democratic candidates. It has become one of the largest donors of ``soft money'' to the Democratic Party. It even loaned $100,000 to Clinton's inaugural committee. Coia personally contributed $1,000 (the maximum permitted) to Clinton's Legal Defense Fund. He joined the board of the Back to Business Committee, where, humorously, he lent his moral authority to the committee's vigorous denials of merit in any of the ``character'' charges against the Clintons.
<P>
Money translated into social access. Soon the President and Coia were Bill and Arthur, eating breakfast together, exchanging gifts of specially made golf clubs. (The President's thank-you note for his arrived on Coia's desk the same day as the Justice Department's complaint.) Coia was invited to a small White House dinner where the President played the saxophone; a Judiciary subcommittee documented over 120 such contacts.
<P>
<font size=+3>D</font><font size=+1>ID</font> all this have any influence on the decision-making process at Justice? At hearings by Rep. McCollum's subcommittee at the end of July, Justice Department officials vigorously denied it and Democratic members of the committee indignantly insisted that there was absolutely no evidence of any White House interference.
<P>
Was there then only the <I>appearance</I> of a quid pro quo? Coia knew the Justice Department complaint was coming. There were obvious channels for a discreet phone call. The President and Coia were represented by the same law firm, and attorney - client privilege would forever protect such a channel of communications. Or Coia might have approached White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. According to Coia himself, the President had designated Ickes as his White House contact. Before taking his White House post, Ickes had represented a number of unions on mob-related charges, including the Laborers. Indeed the court-appointed trustee for a Teamsters local demanded that Ickes's firm withdraw as the local's counsel because of what it complained was its ``lack of independence'' from mob influence.
<P>
But even if there were no contacts between the White House and Justice, there did not have to be interference for there to be influence. Janet Reno's Justice Department has bent itself out of shape to be helpful to the President on Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Paulagate. The political appointees at Justice could not but be sensitive to the President's friendship with Coia. Last week, Ronald Fino, for 16 years an FBI informant within the Laborers on the Cosa Nostra, speaking behind a protective screen, warned McCollum's subcommittee that you can no longer tell a mobster by his fedora hat. ``Projecting an image of goodness, popping up and chairing charitable fund-raising functions combined with a voice for social justice, the racketeer builds a formidable defense against the Justice Department and prosecution.''
<P>
However the decision was made, and whatever the merits of the agreement between Justice and LIUNA -- and it is too soon to tell whether Coia will truly clean up the union or merely get rid of mob rivals -- several things are clear, all of them disquieting.
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Coia had a tremendous victory as he was transformed overnight from accused racketeer to racket-busting pioneer. In effect now endorsed by the Justice Department, he is a sure winner in the union elections in September and is thus guaranteed control of LIUNA until well after 1998, when Justice loses its power to intervene if dissatisfied with Coia's ``progress.'' Significantly, under terms of the agreement, LIUNA's $1-billion pension fund, the pot of gold which had been the mob's chief target, is off limits to the team of investigators Coia agreed to hire. Reform in this area, U.S. Attorney James Burns acknowledges, is ``up to the union.''
<P>
2. The President continued to lend Coia the prestige of his public friendship (including 24 White House visits) <I>after</I> he had been warned about the forthcoming Justice Department complaint. At the McCollum hearings, documents were produced showing that the FBI wrote the White House counsel's office in 1994 that Coia ``is a criminal associate of the New England Patriarca organized crime family'' and the subject of an FBI criminal probe. Another Justice Department memo that same year referred to Mrs. Clinton's staff having been warned, on the occasion of her planning to speak at a LIUNA conference, that ``we plan to portray him as a mob puppet.'' (Undeterred, in early 1995, while Coia was still fighting off the complaint, Mrs. Clinton went to Florida to address LIUNA's conference, Coia proudly accompanying her.)
<br>
Kenneth Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center, which focuses on ethical issues in government, says: ``The appearance problem is enormous here. In the case of a federal judge, a conflict of interest includes the appearance of a conflict of interest. The rationale is that the public should have confidence in its public institutions. If the President allows himself to be seen with a figure like this, it is a betrayal of public trust.''
<P>
3. Even as the Justice Department was chronicling the mob's wholesale pillaging of LIUNA's pension and training funds, departments of the Federal Government were providing the union with millions of dollars for ``training and education.'' A current study by the Heritage Foundation finds that in fiscal 1994 the EPA, HUD, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services between them gave over $11 million to LIUNA, most of it as ``training funds.'' Bizarrely, the Department of Labor, in its annual Inspector General report, cites the prosecution of Michael LaBarbara for stealing training funds from a LIUNA local, while at the same time LIUNA received $475,000 more in, yes, training grants. The taxpayer hardly anticipates that government agencies will be showering discretionary funds on people with colorful nicknames.
<P>
One of the documents released by the McCollum committee shows just how far Coia thought he could go. At Coia's behest Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler sent a memo to both Harold Ickes, who oversees the Clinton campaign from the White House, and Debra DeLee, chief executive of the 1996 Democratic convention, urging them to consider giving Coia a speaking role at that convention.</blockquote>
<P>
Sorry, folks. With all the publicity, he won't be at the podium.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FIRST</font> defense of Clinton partisans against new revelations of corruption, illegality, and general wrongdoing in the Whitewater scandal is to point out that it all occurred a long time ago, before Mr. Clinton was elected President. By implication if not overtly, Mr. Clinton's behavior as President is held to be above suspicion.
<P>
Unfortunately for the tactic, the Clintons seem to attract scandal the way Newt Gingrich attracts controversy. And this tendency didn't stop with Whitewater. Here is a brief list of Clinton scandal since Inaugural Day 1993:
<P>
<B>Filegate:</B> The President's director of personnel security, Craig Livingstone, was caught collecting <I>hundreds</I> of secret FBI files on Reagan and Bush Administration officials. President Clinton, who disclaims familiarity with the facts, nonetheless asserts that this was merely ``a bureaucratic snafu.'' FBI director Louis Freeh -- whose agency complied with the White House's extraordinary requests for these files -- calls it a ``massive'' and ``egregious'' violation of privacy rights. Prosecutors and Congress want to know, among other things, who hired Livingstone and whether he acted on his own, as White House spokesmen claim. Two FBI special agents assigned to the White House insist they were told that Hillary Clinton was Livingstone's patron. While the First Lady has a finger in most White House appointments, including the chef, chief usher, head of the correspondence unit, and Secret Service detail, she denies any association with Livingstone. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will have to sort this out. He will probably invite Mrs. Clinton to testify a second time, under oath, before the grand jury.
<P>
<B>State Department files:</B> The first time Clinton officials were found rifling through files was at the State Department; 160 personnel files of former Bush officials were collected, and disparaging information from two of the files was leaked to the <I>Washington Post</I>. The State Department's inspector general found that this conduct probably violated the Privacy Act. He referred the case to Attorney General Janet Reno for possible criminal prosecution. Miss Reno chose not to pursue the matter.
<P>
<B>Travelgate:</B> The first time Clinton officials misused the FBI was when they concocted criminal charges against the director of the White House Travel Office, Billy Dale. This was done to throw lucrative government travel business to two of the Clintons' Hollywood friends and campaign supporters. Dale, who had worked for Republican and Democratic Presidents, was forced to spend $500,000 on his defense. He was eventually prosecuted on charges of embezzlement by the Clinton Justice Department, but found not guilty after less than two hours of jury deliberation. Independent Counsel Starr is looking into whether former presidential aide David Watkins lied to government investigators to cover up Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travel Office firings. Watkins's own notes show that the First Lady ordered the firings, but Mrs. Clinton has told investigators she had no role in them. Again, she can be expected to give sworn testimony about this to the grand jury.
<P>
<b>The Clinton Cabinet:</B> The Clintons are not the only Administration officials being investigated by an independent counsel. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was forced to resign, is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes from Tyson Foods, Inc., the giant Arkansas poultry company. Of course, the Tysons have been prominent supporters of Mr. Clinton's political career. Moreover, Tyson Foods' top lawyer, James Blair, helped Mrs. Clinton turn a $1,000 cattle-futures investment into $100,000 in less than a year. (Mrs. Clinton originally claimed that her superior financial skills were learned from the pages of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; in truth, this remarkable investment has never been fully explained.)
<P>
An independent counsel is investigating whether HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI during his background investigation about the size and number of payments he made to his former mistress. And before his tragic death, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was being investigated for, among other things, possible financial irregularities.
<P>
<B>The Clinton Sub-Cabinet:</B> Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell -- Mrs. Clinton's former partner in the Rose Law Firm -- is now imprisoned at Cumberland Federal Penitentiary. He was convicted of defrauding some of his clients. Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned after he interfered with Justice Department lawyers' efforts to search the late Vince Foster's office. Former Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy resigned over tax problems and his role in the Travel Office firings. Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and former Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson resigned after it was learned that they had tipped off the President's staff that the Resolution Trust Corporation was sending criminal referrals involving the Clintons to the Justice Department.
<P>
<B>Health Care Task Force:</B> As head of the task force, Mrs. Clinton insisted that the group's meetings be closed to all but six hundred carefully selected government and industry officials who shared her goal of nationalizing America's health-care system. Mrs. Clinton and the task force were sued by three organizations claiming that the secret meetings violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A federal court agreed. Moreover, during the litigation, the presiding judge, Royce Lamberth, became concerned that certain Administration officials may have provided false and misleading information to the court. Judge Lamberth is currently considering whether to bring sanctions against any of these officials.
<P>
<B>Paula Jones:</B> Paula Jones's allegations of sexual harassment by Bill Clinton go back before his Presidency. But his legalistic contortions to evade a trial are a minor scandal in themselves. Incidentally, the Clinton lawyer who alleged that Billy Dale's willingness to have his lawyers plea-bargain was a sign of guilt might want to ponder the fact that the President's lawyers held negotiations with Paula Jones's team on the terms under which she would withdraw her suit. Mr. Clinton maintains that the Constitution immunizes him from civil suits involving allegations of personal misconduct that occurred before he became President. Of course, no such immunity exists. At one time Mr. Clinton claimed immunity as a member of the armed forces. Public outcry caused him to beat a quick retreat from that argument. Recently the Supreme Court agreed to consider the President's immunity claim, thereby delaying the case until after the election.
<P>
<B>Whitewater:</B> While Whitewater per se occurred before the Clintons came to Washington, actions that look like cover-up attempts have taken place in the White House. Last summer, for example, critical Rose Law Firm billing records, containing information about Mrs. Clinton's apparent legal work on the Castle Grande real-estate scam, were discovered outside the First Lady's personal office in the White House residence. The records, sought by lawmen since 1994, were not turned over until this January. Mrs. Clinton has steadfastly denied providing legal advice on Castle Grande. Furthermore, she denies knowing the whereabouts of the long-sought billing records prior to their discovery. Mrs. Clinton was required to give her testimony to the grand jury this January. Since then, the FBI found her fingerprints on the records.

<LI>In Florida, Santa waved to the kiddies from a helicopter. Maybe People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals took away his reindeer? The chopper developed a mechanical problem, landed hard, flipped, and burst into flames. Santa's fake whiskers caught fire and his pillow-belly got snagged on the seatbelt. These unsuspected hazards urgently call for a new federal bureau and <I>scads</I> of regulations to keep Mr. Claus safe! Fortunately, the pilot wriggled free and pulled Santa out, and both sprinted to safety just before the helicopter blew up.

<LI>How much money would John Sweeney have had to spend on the 1996 election if union members had had a say in spending it? Four years ago, the state of Washington conducted an experiment. Voters passed a ballot initiative making it illegal to dock an employee's wages (e.g., through union dues) for political purposes ``except upon written request of the employee.'' The Washington Education Association found that contributions to its PAC fell by five-sixths. (The WEA tried to funnel dues through a ``Community Outreach Program,'' a PAC by another name, but the state took a dim view of this.) Divide Sweeney money by six, and the Democrats would have picked up only one House seat. And they might have lost another ten seats in the Senate.

<LI>Try to follow this plot line: Because the investigation of President Clinton has become too politicized James Carville says he will form an organization devoted to partisan attacks on the man conducting it, without the consent of the White House, which is such an irresponsible scheme with such an unlikely cover story that it lands Carville on every public-affairs TV show in the land over a two-week period; at which point the President privately says he doesn't approve of Carville's effort, which was never contingent on his approval, but Carville nonetheless decides to shut it down without ever starting it because all the negative publicity has been so helpful, including the attacks on him as a ``frothing, rabid dog'' made by Mary Matalin, his wife. Just the latest from the <I>Carville & Matalin Show</I>, airing wherever in America there's a camera or the chance of a good lecture fee.

<LI>Defense ministers of seven nations (Austria, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden) have agreed to establish a standby peacekeeping brigade to be at the disposal of the UN Security Council. The force is to be formed by 1999. Americans should welcome this: it means that U.S. forces, already stretched too thin, will not need to be drawn into every humanitarian emergency. The U.S. has its veto in the Security Council (and should be willing to pay a fair share of the cost of missions it does not veto).

<LI>On the matter of Iraq and oil, it is a very tough call. The objections are not easily coped with. (If Saddam Hussein really cares about helping the drastically sick, why doesn't he build one castle fewer for himself? If Saddam Hussein cares for the strategic prospects of his people, why does he channel the country toward war and devastation?) But after we do the analytical arpeggios we aren't left with anything more obvious than the terrible hunger and illness of the Iraqis. So we are permitting $2 billion in oil sales, and the proceeds will be distributed under UN supervision (61 per cent food, 16 per cent medicine, 5 per cent soap . . .). Will Saddam manage to cheat in the course of things? Yes. Will the world attempt to transform our approval into a reason for granting Iraq greater oil sales in the future? Yes. Is there anything we can do about it, at this point? No. But we do need to remind Saddam that we are looking at him. Maybe send him an exploding cigar every now and then.

<LI>Williams College has become a nest of progressive activity. From forcing women to use unisex toilets and showers (to make them ``less self-conscious about their bodies''), to compelling heterosexual students to declare themselves homosexuals in public (to appreciate how it feels), Williams has embraced Political Correctness like a desperate lover. Williams's admissions policy is ultra-affirmative-action, of course. But perhaps the most comic aspect of Williams's new identity is the discovery that it was offering course credit to students who joined in activities organized by Western Massachusetts Labor Action, which has been linked to the recently raided and heavily armed Provisional Communist Party in Brooklyn. Conceivably, the professors and administrators at Williams were unaware of the connection.

<LI>The Heritage Foundation has produced an impressive new volume, <I>Restoring American Leadership: A U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint</I>. The Heritage team of experts, directed by Kim R. Holmes and Thomas G. Moore, surveys the fundamental problems of U.S. national strategy, in areas such as regional challenges (especially in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East), defense policy, economic policy, and the tools of policymaking (the UN, intelligence, foreign aid, public diplomacy). It is a well-done critique, with wise prescriptions -- a needed antidote to isolationist undercurrents that would leave the world a more dangerous place.

<LI>For 12 days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, which is their right, but also set up blockades -- at ports, on freeways, and around oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gasoline ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not ``use force'' to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $700 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad that were hard hit. The French economy also suffered severely. But this is merely the tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

<P>

<LI>A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced. Dr. Nancy Krieger explained that this was a consequence of ``suppressed or internalized response.'' The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crime -- which, according to Irving Louis Horowitz in the January 1995 <I>Society</I>, is sixty times as common as white-on-black crime  -- has on the health of whites.



<P>

<P>
<LI>President Clinton received advice from two sources during his recent bout with acute hoarseness. His doctor said he should remain silent, and his lawyer affirmed that that was his right.

<P>
<hr>
<P>


<LI><I>USA Today</I> recently published its music writers' list of the best music for the holiday season. Included were an abortion-rights classic, ``O Come All Ye Faithful: Rock for Choice,'' and an R&B favorite, ``Christmas on Death Row.'' Great for stocking stuffers. Ho, ho, ho.

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>Y</font> mother reports that as a toddler I touched a hot stove only once, displaying an early ability to learn from experience. (Of course, I wasn't a blonde back then.) This ability is in surprisingly short supply among congressional Republicans. Still worshipping at the shrine of deficit reduction, some GOP congressmen are itching to make a technical adjustment in the government's inflation index. The idea is that this would dramatically reduce the deficit over the next few years. But it would do so by raising taxes and reducing Social Security benefits. The Republicans' only concession to their own political health is to insist that Bill Clinton lead the way over this particular cliff.
<P>
Economists agree that the Consumer Price Index, which measures consumer prices for a fixed market basket of goods and services, exaggerates the cost of living. As Ed Rubenstein explains in greater detail, because the CPI doesn't allow for consumers' tendency to substitute cheaper goods for higher-priced ones, the growing popularity of discount shopping, or the higher quality of new products, it overstates increases in the cost of living. It thus inflates the cost-of-living adjustments used to index Social Security and military retirees' benefits, and income-tax brackets, personal exemptions, and the standard deduction. 
<P>
A commission of economists headed by Michael Boskin, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under George Bush, recently concluded that the CPI probably overstates inflation by (a misleadingly precise) 1.1 percentage points a year. The percentage looks small, but the consequences of adjusting the CPI would be enormous.
<P>
First, the good news. Economic performance over the past two decades has been much better than indicated by the faulty CPI. Properly measured, real median family income has risen by 36 per cent since 1972, not by 4 per cent as current government statistics indicate. So we have been better off than we thought -- but many of us are not going to be as well off in the future if the CPI is adjusted downward. That's the red-hot stove that some politicians are sorely tempted to touch.
<P>
They are tempted because a 1-point downward adjustment in the CPI would reduce deficits by $600 billion over the next ten years, thereby making their pledge to balance the budget far easier to live up to. Most of the saving would come from lower benefit payments, but the Joint Economic Committee points out that roughly 40 per cent of it will come in the form of higher taxes on ``primarily middle-class taxpayers.'' Uh-oh. Benefit cuts and tax increases? Whose responsibility will this combustible combination be?
<P>
The clearly erroneous index is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which can be expected to make some needed adjustments over time. But the Boskin Commission recommended that the President and Congress make a larger adjustment and make it now. Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth stresses that any change must be ``broadly and deeply bi-partisan.'' Like the congressional pay raise of seven years ago?
<P>
Some conservatives are warning Republican legislators of the dangers they face. Steve Forbes predicts that if Republicans are seen as advocating tax increases and benefit cuts they will squander the political capital needed to make the reforms that are really needed in the whole structure of Social Security. ``If Republicans get caught up in looking as if we're trying to do something to current recipients, we'll be hammered the way we were on Medicare,'' says Forbes, who urges members of Congress to ``look at the big picture -- a major reform of Social Security for young people.'' 
<P>
Forbes is not alone. Dave Mastio, writing in <I>Slate</I>, points out that adopting Boskin's recommendation for reducing Social Security COLAs would abort the growing interest in Social Security reform by providing a short-term fix to the trust fund's financial problems. 
<P>
Leila Bates, director of tax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy, believes it is up to Bill Clinton to prod the BLS to reform the index. ``Republicans shouldn't want to be accused of raising taxes and cutting benefits,'' she states.
<P>
Senator Pat Moynihan, Capitol Hill's biggest enthusiast for a downward adjustment to the CPI precisely <I>because</I> it would stall major Social Security reforms, declares ``We're not trying to cut, we're not trying to raise. We're proposing an accurate count.'' But Republicans who spent the past year making unlistened-to arguments about reductions in the rate of growth of Medicare shouldn't relish spending the next two years playing defense on Social Security reductions.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> they would be facing the same tormentors. The American Association of Retired Persons and the AFL - CIO oppose a major CPI adjustment. Bill Clinton might embrace it now, and later get away with distancing himself from this ``Republican reduction in benefits.'' Which is how House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt could be counted on to describe it even if the Administration was supporting it.
<P>
Congressman Chris Cox (R., Calif.) believes that it is up to the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see that the CPI is as accurate as possible and rejects the Boskin plan as a way to cut spending. Unlike too many members who are yearning to reduce the deficit ``painlessly,'' Cox scorns the ``Darmanesque gimmick'' of using COLA cuts to achieve ``so-called savings,'' and he doesn't want government revenues to increase as much as they would under the Boskin plan.
<P>
Congressman David McIntosh (R., Ind.) agrees that it would be a ``terrible idea'' for Congress to adjust the CPI in a way that would impose ``a hidden tax increase on the middle class.'' 
<P>
Republicans in Congress should let the Bureau of Labor Statistics make appropriate adjustments in the market basket used to calculate the CPI. The only downward adjustments they should be contemplating are in our record tax and spending levels.

<H2>Carl Rowan's Lurch</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 12<br>









Mr. Al Neuharth, the publisher emeritus of <I>USA Today</I>, advised his readers, ``This is a book that will scare the bejesus out of most of us.'' He is talking about Carl Rowan's <I>The Coming Race War in America</I>. ``[Rowan] makes a scary case that hatemongers are hurling us toward an inevitable racial Armageddon.''
<P>
In the event you haven't time to read this column to the end, let me reassure you right away that there is every reason for all of us to be scared by Jesus, Who ordained that we should lead better lives than most of us do, but there is no reason for the bejesus to be scared out of us by the book in question, which is alarmist, silly, and quite stupid. 
<P>
Mr. Neuharth, in his review, repeats the names of the ten principal ``hatemongers'' in America. It is at times like these that one sighs for the better days when the libel laws could be invoked. Among the top ten hatemongers in America, if you will believe Carl Rowan -- which you will do if you take leave of your senses -- are Newt Gingrich and Richard Cohen (of the <I>Washington Post</I>). Why is Newt Gingrich a hatemonger? ``For a generation we have seen a law-enforcement version of genocide: our failed drug war has incarcerated, or destroyed the reputations of, a fourth of the young black men in this country. And now we hear a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, endorse 'boot camps' for first-time violators of the law. And Newt Gingrich urging a 'wartime' stance in which the Federal Government builds detention camps. Welcome to the old South Africa and Nazi Germany!'' 
<P>
The opening line in Mr. Rowan's book is, ``Sensational, inflammatory journalism has never been my style. I have never written dire prophecies of human disasters except when there was compelling evidence that calamity was at hand.'' 
<P>
Well, is such evidence at hand? Yes, it is all over the place, says Mr. Rowan. There is ``the cruelly bigoted rhetoric that often befouls the well of the House of Representatives.'' The ``swastikas and Ku Klux Klan symbols that festoon our military barracks.'' That <I>what</I> our barracks? <I>Decorate</I> our barracks? 
<P>
But that is the way Mr. Rowan writes. Here he is on Ronald Reagan. ``No President in my lifetime ever played the race card to such political benefit as Reagan did. His fulminations about welfare, his loud support of states' rights, his publicity stunts -- including opening a re-election campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil-rights workers (two Jewish, one black) had been murdered -- helped to rip most of the South away from Democratic control.''
<P>
If you can be brought to believe that President Reagan opened his re-election campaign in a town in Mississippi because three civil-rights workers had been murdered there, intending to identify himself with the cause of the murderers, then you are ready to believe that Carl Rowan has his wits about him. 
<P>
``What I will never forget or forgive is that Reagan had no minorities of consequence inside his campaign team. His Cabinet had only one black man in it, and he was embarrassing. And worst of all, Reagan went eight years refusing to talk to any civil-rights leaders.'' 
<P>
Now get this, the very next sentence. After Reagan's ``refusal to talk to any civil-rights leaders.'' Ready? ``When I asked him why, in 1988, he invited me to lunch.'' That is how difficult it was for a prominent black to get a look at President Reagan. You call him up, he asks you to lunch. 
<P>
What did he say at lunch? 
<P>
``They criticized me upon my election, so I just said, 'To hell with 'em.''' There are several possible reactions on the part of the reader. 1) Rowan misquoted Reagan. (People who know Reagan well know the intensity of his commitment to racial equality.) 2) Reagan said it, in the sense of: ``What can I do with civil-rights leaders who insist on being hostile to me?'' And 3) Reagan said it and went on to guard against the kind of interpretation Rowan has of course put on it. 
<P>
It goes on. Irving Kristol ``dispenses quota crap.'' ``In September, the newspaper of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, declared Reagan its favorite candidate, asserting that 'the Republican platform reads as if it were written by a Klansman.''' Well, Mr. Rowan's book reads as if it were written by a besotted simpleton, which it was.

NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY -- DOCUMENT EXTRACT Telephone Transcript 12/16/96<br>
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT 09:33 Static.<br> 
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Rusty? Rusty? I'm not sure if the satellite link is working. I can't hear you. Static.<br> 
VPOTUS: So let me just say, Merry Christmas. And did you get the fruitcake? Static.<br> 
VPOTUS: Well, just in case you didn't, we'll send another down to Brazil. OK? Static.<br> 
VPOTUS: Okay! Click. Line dead. 09:44<br> 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, Al, Got a sec? <br> 
VPOTUS: Sure, Bill. What's up?<br> 
POTUS: Well, this is a delicate matter. You see, Jim Carville is hitting Ken Starr pretty hard, and --<br>  
VPOTUS: Bill, I understand completely.<br> 
POTUS: You do?<br>  
VPOTUS: Sure. You want to come out publicly and say, ``Hey! Jim's right! Ken Starr is a partisan attack dog!'' And may I say, Bill, right on!<br>  
POTUS: Actually, Al, I want to do the opposite.<br>  
VPOTUS: You want to come out publicly and say, ``Hey! Jim's wrong! Ken Starr is a fair-minded investigator who's about to indict my wife?''<br> 
POTUS: Something between the two.<br>  
VPOTUS: Okay.<br>  
POTUS: See, if we keep -- I mean, if Jim keeps -- hitting Ken Starr like we are -- I mean, like he is -- well, it's starting to backfire. The press is against us -- I mean, against him -- and it just looks like Hillary and I are scared.<br>  
VPOTUS: And you're not, right?<br>  
POTUS: No, we are. Very. So why keep picking on this guy and making him mad? Let him take the McDougals and Hale and Kendall and Hillary's secretary and Marceca and Livingstone and whoever else. Let him take 'em all. That's business. There's no need to make it personal, you know?<br>  
VPOTUS: I guess I see your point. But, darn it, I think Ken Starr is on a partisan witch hunt.<br>  
POTUS: Well, Al, I agree with you. But it's not your witch he's after. Click. Line dead. 11:23 <br> 
VPOTUS: Hi, Jim.<br> 
UNIDENTIFIED SOUTHERN MALE: Yeah, hey, Mr. Vice President. How'ya doin' up there?<br>  
VPOTUS: I'm okay, Jim. How are you? <br> 
UNSOMA: Okay, I guess.<br>

VPOTUS: As I know you know, the President can't publicly support what you've been saying, but between you and me, you're doing a terrific job.<br> 
UNSOMA: Yeah okay, but I'm knockin' my head against the wall here like a rat in a coffee can, you know? I'm marching up and down the street all alone out here like it was Gay Pride Day in Salt Lake City, you know?<br>  
VPOTUS: I'm not following you, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: Thas jes' what I mean, sir. Not a one is followin' me. I'm out here by lonesome Jim's self.<br> 
VPOTUS: Well, to be honest, Jim, the crusade -- while well meant and absolutely one hundred per cent justified -- well, it's backfiring a little.<br> 
UNSOMA: Backfiring?<br>  
VPOTUS: Yeah. So we thought, Hey, maybe old Jim has done his bit, let's just all back off some so that the thing doesn't blow up in our faces. You know, if we keep hitting Starr and keep hitting Starr and then he indicts, oh, just for the sake of argument, you-know-who --<br>  
UNSOMA: Who?<br>  
VPOTUS: Think, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: I am thinking.<br>  
VPOTUS: Think harder. Think perjury. Think obstruction of justice.<br>  
UNSOMA: The President?<br>  
VPOTUS: Well, I meant Hillary, but I see your point. Look, we all appreciate your efforts, but to continue would only hurt the President. And as much as I'd like to be President myself, I'd rather win it fair and square, not by waving goodbye on the White House lawn while Marine One choppers out. That would just get really weird. I mean, Chelsea would probably have to stay with us while she finished school, and Tipper just hates what they've done to the Blue Room, and --<br>  
UNSOMA: So you want me to quit?<br>  
VPOTUS: Yeah, Jim.<br>  
UNSOMA: Jes' pack it in?<br>  
VPOTUS: Please. For Bill.<br>  
UNSOMA: Well, okay. But I'm not giving the money back.<br>  
VPOTUS: What money?<br>  
UNSOMA: Last week we got a check for $25,000 to keep up the heat on Ken Starr.<br> 
VPOTUS: Who from?<br>  
UNSOMA: Someone named Tipper Gore.<br>

Get ready to see hordes of starving children on the screen, if not the streets. Liberals are gearing up to ``fix'' the welfare bill passed this summer. They want to let noncitizens (and, in their more fanciful moments, single men under 50 who don't work) collect food stamps. Similarly, they want to ease eligibility rules for noncitizens seeking Supplemental Security Income -- currently the fastest-growing welfare program. All told, they would snatch back $13 billion of the $55 billion the welfare bill saved. The First Lady wants to lead this charge. Sounds good to us; maybe she can bring back Ira Magaziner to assist. Republicans in Congress should be looking forward to fighting on this territory. But the liberals are right on one point: the welfare bill <I>should</I> be revisited. Work requirements should be strengthened; under the law only a quarter of recipients have to work by 2002. Medicaid should be cut and block-granted to the states. And the Legal Services Corporation should be prohibited from using federal funds to challenge welfare reform -- or to do anything else, for that matter.

From the <I>Washington Post</I>: ``President Clinton faces a choice as he returns this week to the business of staffing his Administration for a second term: He will either make history by appointing a woman to one of the two spots on his national-security team, or risk sorely disappointing many of the very voters who provided his margin of victory in last month's election'' (John J. Harris, Dec. 3). Does that mean Mary Landrieu has to staff her Senate office with dead black people?

Resigning FDA Commissioner David Kessler claims to have been asked by the Clinton Administration to stay on, but that seems unlikely, in view of his recently revealed cheating on job-related travel expenses. According to the published accounts of <I>l'affaire</I> Kessler, he has virtually admitted the misdeeds -- falsifying travel vouchers, double-billing travel expenses and the like -- by returning money to the government. Clearly this commissioner needed a warning label. The most-often-mentioned candidate to replace him is Lynn Goldman, now Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances at the Environmental Protection Agency. A solid Clinton choice: she's scientifically challenged, has conducted a virtual war on innovation in the biotechnology and pesticide industries, and presides over an organization known for chaotic incompetence (it recently lost two hundred files containing industrial trade secrets). The good news is that she should be unconfirmable by the Republican-controlled Senate.

A devastating front-page headline in the November 18 <I>Washington Post</I> shattered the illusions of the bi-partisan Beltway Establishment: ``IMMIGRATION ISSUES AWAIT NEW CONGRESS: Surging Legal Influx Will Be among Topics of Renewed Debate.'' Rushing to restore these illusions in a December 2 letter to the Editor: Stuart Anderson (alas) of the Cato Institute (alack). Anderson's claim: the current increase (to about one million in 1996) somehow doesn't count, because it's due to the fact that the three million-odd beneficiaries of the 1986 amnesty are now becoming citizens and sponsoring their relatives. Unmentioned corollary to Anderson's claim: eventually this new immigration boom will produce another boom, as these sponsored relatives get to sponsor their own relatives. Unindicted culprit: the misnamed ``family reunification'' principle, which treats immigration as a civil right extended to a randomly selected class of foreigners -- the relatives of recent immigrants -- and divorces it from any American interest. In fact, no serious analyst denies that the 1990s will see record immigration, probably in excess of ten million, bringing with it everything from overcrowded schools to female circumcision. Immigration enthusiasts are committed to a policy that brings them into increasingly desperate conflict with the facts, and common sense.

As Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee in the last Congress, Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) led the unsuccessful Senate fight to reduce legal-immigration levels. Simpson's retirement means that the torch must be passed to a successor. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.), who firmly supported moderate cuts in immigration, has seniority on the subcommittee, and so the chairmanship is his if he wants it. But Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), the man most responsible for killing reform of legal immigration in the Senate last year, has been lobbying for the position. While <I>NR</I> admires Sen. Abraham and supports him on most issues (indeed, <I>NR</I> backed him for Chairman of the Republican National Committee four years ago), his misguided views on immigration have consequences too grave to be ignored. <I>NR</I> hopes that Kyl, who understands the urgent need for immigration reform, will take the chairmanship. If he doesn't, appointing Abraham would continue an immigration policy utterly disconnected from our national interests. It would also represent contempt for rank-and-file Republicans, who in an RNC survey supported lower levels of immigration by overwhelming margins. If their views are to be so casually ignored, the RNC should feel the pinch in its next fund appeal.

Meanwhile, Haley Barbour's successor as RNC Chairman will be chosen by the RNC's 165 voting members at next month's winter meeting. There is no clear frontrunner among the current candidates, who include RNC General Counsel David Norcross of New Jersey, ex-RNC Co-Chairman Jeanie Austin of Florida, Chuck Yob of Michigan, and Bob Bennett of Ohio. Former New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill has also entered the race. Committee conservatives haven't endorsed a candidate but there is no doubt who would be unacceptable to them. National Committeeman Morton Blackwell sees Jeanie Austin as ``actively hostile to traditional conservatives'' and says, `` David Norcross's principal credential is that he has always done exactly what he has been told to do.'' Conservatives hope that Texas GOP Chairman Tom Pauken will join the field. In an ideal world a principled conservative like Pauken, with a thirty-year record of commitment to the movement, would win by acclamation. But until the party's establishment is as conservative as its grassroots, Pauken's supporters can only hope to form a coalition to ensure that a candidate not openly hostile to traditional conservatives wins. Applications from other conservative heavyweights would be welcome. (Confidential to Vin Weber -- now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.)

Turnabout is more than fair play -- sometimes it's positively therapeutic. Now that the Clinton Administration is feeling the lash of the independent-counsel law (latest installment: the Landmark Legal Foundation calls for an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Gore's Buddhist temple fundraising) liberals and Democrats are beginning to question its wisdom. They are right, if tardy. The statute turns political battles, which would be best decided by the public, into legal disputes resolved by grand juries. And it has always been a constitutional bastard, an invention of congressional Democrats to increase their leverage over the Executive Branch. The law expires in 1999, at which point it should be left for dead. Until then, however, Democrats, like Frankenstein, must live with their creation.

For the last five years Bill Clinton has labeled Presidents Reagan and Bush the ``free lunch crowd'' -- the people who ran up the national debt by more than $3 trillion. And for nearly a decade Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia -- pork-barreler extraordinaire -- has proclaimed that the budgets passed by Congress in the 1980s spent less money than the Reagan Administration requested. Byrd and his colleagues were allegedly the tightwads, Ronald Reagan the big spender. A new report by the Institute for Policy Innovation in Lewisville, Texas, entitled, ``Whose Free Lunch? The Truth about the Reagan Deficits,'' balances the books: Reagan's budget requests were lower in every single year that he submitted a budget than the actual amount Congress spent. The total excess spending by Congress over those years was $209 billion. Congress spent $80 billion less than requested on national defense in fiscal years 1982 - 89, but $300 billion more on domestic programs -- mostly entitlements. Yes, we would still have had large budget deficits in the 1980s even if all Reagan's budget requests had been enacted. But those deficits would have been about $25 billion a year <I>lower</I> than the red ink Congress actually spilled. Footnote: the IPI study also shows that every President since Gerald Ford has wanted to spend less money than Congress has. Except for one: Bill Clinton.

Russia's General Aleksandr Lebed paid his first visit to the U.S. in mid November, seeing senior State, Pentagon, and NSC officials and wowing policy wonks in New York and Washington. He was charismatic, articulate, candid -- and shrewd in the moderate impression he fostered. He was eager for good relations with the U.S., he said; Americans and Russians have so much in common (unlike the Europeans). He claimed to be relaxed about NATO enlargement and uninterested in reintegration of the former Soviet republics (``Russia is tired of being the cow that everyone milks'') -- the two usual hobby horses of Russian nationalists. He dined with the Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian ambassadors and pledged his respect for their independence. Lebed's preoccupations are clearly domestic -- restoring the dignity of the army; purging the kleptocracy that runs the country; freeing up the economy by reducing government interference. He is a nationalist, devoted to restoring Russia's glory, and a  force. While he avowed his loyalty to Boris Yeltsin, he seems capable of filling any vacuum that should appear. Whether he is ultimately a threat to the West remains to be seen, but he is clearly a more complex -- and perhaps more formidable -- phenomenon than he was originally perceived to be, by <I>NR</I> among others.

Hillary Rodham Clinton stirred up the social scene Down Under, according to the <I>Sydney Morning Herald</I>. Invited to a glitzy reception, she was ``so dissatisfied'' with the guest list that she arranged to have several prominent leftists crash the private party. She explained that she had an important speech to make and wanted somebody there who could ``appreciate'' it, as, presumably, the hostess and the invited guests could not. And Americans think Australians are rude and crude.

Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, whom they then tossed in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what  they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will. ``Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes, and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments.''

For several years Joseph Epstein, one of the finest essayists of our time, has been a bone in the throat of the academic establishment. At last they have managed to get rid of him as editor of <I>American Scholar</I>, the quarterly journal of the Phi Beta Kappa society. He had edited that magazine without partisanship, and his own regular essays had been a principal reason for reading it. He despised Victimology, the current academic religion, which earned him the hatred of such usual suspects as the novelist Joyce Carol Oates and feminist Rutgers dean Catherine Stimson. The war against Epstein was conducted on the op-ed page of the <I>New York Times</I> and on the academic grapevine. As Baudelaire remarked to Manet, ``You have the honor of being hated.'' The name of the journal <I>American Scholar</I> recalls Emerson's August 31, 1837, address, which became one of his major essays. Emerson attacked the complacency of the Harvard intelligentsia of his day, and spoke sternly of independence of mind as the duty of the American scholar. Joseph Epstein will continue to write in that spirit, even though he has been fired by a gang of conformist philistines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OR</font>  the first time in 36 years, there is nobody in line for the next Republican presidential nomination. In fact, nobody has stepped up to become the clear political leader of the conservative movement since Ronald Reagan left the White House.
<P>
But these are not dismal tidings for conservatism. The Right has impressive bench strength -- new figures without national reputations and unlikely to be presidential contenders in 2000, but effective and principled potential leaders for the future.
<P>
At the suggestion of <I>NR</I>'s editors, I have selected five conservatives to keep an eye on. Since their selection is nothing if not arbitrary, I set four arbitrary rules for picking them.
<P>
1) No household names; they must not be people widely recognized. 2) No noble losers, but rather people who win elections. 3) No moderates; bona fide conservatives only. 4) No political correctness mandating diversity (which regrettably ends up with no women on the bench).
<P>
Michigan Gov. John Engler, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, and Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft have been around a shade too long to qualify. Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson are attractive and effective, but the conservatism of each has yet to be proved. George's brother Jeb is surely conservative enough; both he and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith would qualify had they not lost races for governor, in Florida and Indiana, respectively.
<P>
Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, Michigan Sen. Spence Abraham, and Oklahoma Reps. Steve Largent and J. C. Watts were just nosed out by these five:
<P>
Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas; University of California Regent Ward Connerly; California Attorney General Dan Lungren; Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana.
<P>
And here is a ``junior varsity'' of promising conservatives at state and local levels:
<P>
Raleigh (N.C.) Mayor Tom Fetzer; Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher; Colorado State Treasurer Bill Owens; Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate; Illinois State Sen. Steve Rauschenberger.
<P>
<b>Sam Brownback, 40, Garnett, Kan.:</b> Thanks to Robert J. Dole's resignation, Brownback became the first of the famous House freshman class of 1994 to advance to the Senate.
<P>
The road was not easy. Kansas may have been the most consistently Republican state over the past generation, but it did not send movement conservatives to Washington -- until Sam Brownback.
<P>
A farmboy turned lawyer, Brownback served for six years as secretary of the Kansas Board of Agriculture and as a White House fellow in 1990 - 91 -- long enough to convince him the Federal Government is much too big.
<P>
His 1994 run for Congress, his first attempt at elective office, was against Democrat John Carlin, a former two-term governor. Embracing the Contract with America, Brownback won 66 per cent of the vote and carried every county in his district.
<P>
Brownback ignored Sam Rayburn's advice that House newcomers should be seldom seen and never heard. He quickly formed the New Federalists, 14 rookie Republicans dedicated to slashing government.
<P>
By the time Dole resigned from the Senate this June, Brownback had become disillusioned with House Republican leadership. He now had a shot at a Senate seat in a new kind of Senate -- with Trent Lott as Majority Leader and conservatives such as himself replacing the Doles and the Hatfields.
<P>
But first he had to face what he calls ``The Machine'' -- the Kansas Republican establishment. Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate, pro-choice Republican, filled the Dole vacancy by naming his lieutenant governor, Sheila Frahm, a dependable organization politician who is pro-choice and anti-term-limits, and who refused to sign a federal no-tax-increase pledge.
<P>
Mrs. Frahm began the primary campaign with a huge lead over Brownback. But Brownback, strongly supported by religious conservatives, tapped voters newly converted to the Republican Party and won -- easily.
<P>
Next he faced a formidable opponent with the most prestigious Democratic name in Kansas: Jill Docking, who ran as a fiscally conservative businesswoman appealing to establishment Republicans who were turned off by Brownback's support from the Religious Right.
<P>
When Mrs. Docking led in some polls, a number of political reporters were prepared to deplore the Republican folly of losing a safe seat by turning to an extremist. But Brownback won -- again, easily. Kansas has its first bona fide conservative senator in four decades.
<P>
<b>Ward Connerly, 57, Sacramento, Calif.:</b> Connerly is in a different category from the others. Although he is undoubtedly a Republican and a conservative, whether he will be a national leader is a matter of considerable doubt.
<P>
The doubt does not stem from Connerly's appeal. This black businessman awed conservatives with his courage and eloquence in leading the fight for the California Civil Rights Initiative. The question is whether, having experienced the rancid swamps of politics, he wants to get in any deeper.
<P>
Connerly, born in rural poverty in Louisiana, became a Republican 28 years ago. He was working for the California state housing department when he was lured away to become chief consultant to a new State Assembly Committee on Urban Affairs by its chairman, a liberal Republican named Pete Wilson.
<P>
Following Wilson's advice, Connerly later went into the private sector to forge a successful career as a land consultant. He declined a full-time position in Gov. Wilson's administration, but he did accept a 12-year term as a University of California Regent.
<P>
From that normally obscure base, he led the way in rolling back race and gender preferences in the giant university system. Next came his leadership in the turbulent battle for passage of CCRI. In its course, he was vilified by black leaders (one advertisement depicted him as a robed Klansman) and given the cold shoulder by corporate leaders fearful of upsetting the status quo.
<P>
That experience has led Connerly to reject appeals to run against liberal Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer next election, and indeed to say he will never again enter the political arena. But he is expected to continue his fight for an even playing field.
<p>
<B>Daniel E. Lungren, 49, Sacramento, Calif.:</B> Articulate, handsome, Catholic, a proven vote-getter, and a native Californian, Lungren is a presidential candidate of the future -- but only if elected governor in 1998. That would mark the fifth straight successful Republican campaign for governor, but the first time an arguably legitimate conservative had been elected since 1970.
<P>
Lungren is pro-life, a supply-sider, and tough on crime and immigration. His position in the California GOP was underlined at the party's platform-committee proceedings in San Diego last summer. While Lungren was inside drafting a socially conservative platform, Pete Wilson was outside in a press conference denouncing it.
<P>
Lungren spent five terms (1979 - 88) in Congress, where he became a leader on crime and immigration legislation. So well was he regarded by former colleagues that he was pushed by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey to be Dole's running-mate.
<P>
He had joined with Gingrich to form the ``Conservative Opportunity Society,'' and was among those who sought to oust Bob Michel as Republican minority leader in 1980. But by 1984, Michel had tapped him to manage the Republican anti-crime legislation.
<P>
Lungren left Congress in 1988 to accept appointment as state treasurer but was rejected by the Democratic-controlled State Senate. However, in 1990 he was elected state attorney general, and he was re-elected in 1994 with a 4.4-million-vote landslide.
<P>
<b>Rick Santorum, 38, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</b> He is the first genuinely conservative Republican senator from Pennsylvania in half a century and a rising star in the Senate. At a time of Republican - conservative decline in the Northeast, Santorum swims against the tide.
<P>
After four years with a law firm in Pittsburgh, this second-generation Italian - American ran for Congress in 1990 against a seven-term Democrat. Santorum was outspent nearly 3 to 1, but knocked on 25,000 doors promising reform and change. He barely won.
<P>
He was one of the ``Gang of Seven'' freshman Republicans who exposed the House Bank scandal -- a foundation of the 1994 GOP takeover of the House. But by that time Santorum was running for the Senate against Sen. Harris Wofford, the national Democratic poster boy after his 1991 upset win.
<P>
Santorum, strongly supported by religious conservatives, did everything a candidate is not supposed to do in the Northeast. He was pro-life, challenged Wofford on health care, and opposed gun control. He barely won.
<P>
Once in the Senate as its youngest member, he did not hold his tongue. On the Balanced Budget Amendment, he challenged the venerable Sen. Robert Byrd in floor debate, and he called for Sen. Mark Hatfield to step down as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee after Hatfield cast the decisive vote against the amendment.
<P>
Asked in early 1995 to name the most outstanding new GOP senators, Trent Lott mentioned Santorum first. Now, Santorum is a trusted personal lieutenant of the new Majority Leader in the new activist Senate.
<P>
<b>W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, 53, Thibodaux, La.:</b> A House member for 16 years, he is an infant in Republican years. He began the 104th Congress saying he would stay a Democrat ``for now,'' but that did not turn out to be too long. His walk across the aisle was signaled when he subscribed to all ten items in the Contract with America.
<P>
As a Democrat, he fought for private-property rights, with demands for compensation of citizens deprived of their property by government action. That often put him on a collision course with the imperious House Commerce Committee chairman, John Dingell.
<P>
Tauzin was elected to Congress nine times as a Democrat, closely allied with Louisiana's notorious former governor, Edwin Edwards. Yet last summer, he was selected to deliver the keynote address to the GOP platform committee by its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde. Concerned by reports that the platform writers were getting wobbly, Tauzin urged the committee to hold firm.
<P>
He had been expected to run for the Senate in 1996 but stayed in the House instead, earning his tenth term without opposition -- the first time that has ever happened to a party-switcher. He is an integral part of the Republican inner circle, representing the migration of conservative Democrats in the Deep South to the GOP.
<P>
Now, here are five conservatives to watch at the state and local levels:
<P>
<I>Tom Fetzer, 41, Raleigh, N.C.:</I> A former staffer for Republican Gov. Jim Martin, he was the upset winner in the 1993 non-partisan elections in a city considered a Democratic bastion. As mayor, he has cut taxes and personnel.
<P> 
<I>Mike Fisher, 52, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</I> A veteran state legislator, Fisher bucked the 1996 Clinton tide in Pennsylvania to eke out a victory for attorney general. A law-and-order conservative, he owes his victory to support from religious conservatives assailed by the state's senior senator, Republican Arlen Specter.
<P>
<I>Bill Owens, 46, Aurora, Colo.:</I> A businessman/state legislator, Owens was elected to his first full-time government post as state treasurer in 1994. He champions taxpayers and private enterprise. His eight visits to Russia, including a 1995 stint as an election observer, suggest he has more on his mind than Colorado state investments.
<P>
<I>Paul Pate, 38, Marion, Iowa:</I> Owner and operator of a paving and construction company, Pate served six years in the State Senate before his election as secretary of state in 1994. He has pressed for deregulation of business and is the hope of Iowa conservatives for governor in 1998.
<P>
<I>Steven J. Rauschenberger, 40, Elgin, Ill.:</I> A furniture retailer, he was elected to the State Senate in 1992 and is now chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He has specialized in tax relief and welfare reform and is a prospect for the future in a state where conservatives have fared poorly the past two decades.

<H2>The California Marijuana Vote</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 15<br>







The vote in California (forgetting, for the moment, the startling vote in Arizona) on the marijuana question mobilizes opponents on divers grounds. 
<P>
Proposition 215, voted in by a heavy majority (56 per cent), imposes new laws respecting marijuana. It is probably unsafe to say that the law was ``designed'' to make marijuana available to sick people whose doctors recommended it as a tranquilizer or stomach settler, or whatever. Unsafe, because it is entirely possible that something else was intended by the voters, namely general judicial relief. Proposition 215 is as indefinite in the authority given to doctors to authorize marijuana as <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I> turned out to be to doctors who recommend abortion ``for the safety of the mother.''
<P>
Dazed opponents of 215 are prepared to fight on several fronts. The excitable California attorney general, Dan Lungren, has sent out the word that 215 is to be interpreted very strictly as something a doctor has to recommend on a case-by-case basis. Some opponents are citing federal laws. There is one such against the use of marijuana, and no doubt there will be a legal battle over the question. If so, we will hear from the solicitor general that although individual states may decide whether the sale of alcohol is legal, the Federal Government exercises preemptive rights when marijuana is at issue.
<P>
The California Medical Association has received 215 as a mandate to the National Institutes of Health to grow up. Many California voters were presumably soured into voting Yes by the notorious decision of the NIH a year or so ago to refuse to conduct studies on the medical value of smoked marijuana on the grounds that to do so would require experimentation on live people. Such was the reasoning, up until not so long ago, of some theologians, who stood in the way of men seeking to ascertain whether they were fertile on the grounds that to produce examinable semen would require masturbation. In fact, likely findings from the NIH could hardly confute the direct evidence of hundreds of witnesses to the effectiveness of marijuana in certain circumstances as a palliative. The Food and Drug Administration approved the active ingredient in marijuana (THC) years ago, to counteract the wasting effect of cancer. ``But,'' the <I>Orange County Register</I> reminds us, ``it's legally available only in pill form, which is criticized as expensive and of little help to patients too nauseated to swallow.'' It isn't likely that any judge in California will find means of freezing Proposition 215 until the NIH comes in with its finding. 
<P>
Mourners over the success of 215 point out that opponents were vastly outspent. Yes, but we are talking nickels and dimes. Supporters of the reform raised $1.8 million, which in California politics is barely enough to squeeze in your middle initial. Opponents spent $28,000. But the plebiscite was noticed primarily by attention given to it in editorial and news coverage. You don't need a lot of paid time to advertise a conclusion a) that people who are sick and are helped by marijuana should be free to take it; and b) (if only indirectly) that it is time to say no to the Narcs who want to arrest and imprison anyone who uses the stuff.
<P> 
It was so also in Arizona, where Proposition 200, the Drug Medicalization, Prevention, and Control Act, won 65 per cent of the vote. It says that Arizona's doctors can prescribe marijuana, heroin, and LSD for patients when there is ``medicinal value.'' The proposition goes further, giving grounds to free some thousand prisoners provided that their only crime was drug possession. It eliminates criminal penalties for first-timers caught with small amounts of drugs, so long as they were not involved in violence (simultaneously, Proposition 200 stiffened penalties for violent crimes done under the influence of drugs).
<P>
At moments like this one really has to cheer the federal system. Ten years from now one should have the data with which soberly to assess the difference between life and health and justice in California under the new law and, say, New York under the old law. It is vital for those who welcome Proposition 215 to bear in mind that effectively eliminating the legal penalty against nonchalant pot is no reason to abandon educational warnings against its use, and medical warnings against its abuse.

Tipper Gore, who gave no reason,<br>
Decided to celebrate this holiday season<br>
And replace the usual family Christmas letter --<br>
 
You know the one? With a Xeroxed header:<br>

``How the Gores spent the year that's waning''<br>

(You know how: they were all campaigning!) -- <br>

With a little rhyme, a Christmas corker,<br>

An idea borrowed from The New Yorker.<br>

<P>
Ninety-six brought the giddy knowledge<br>

That Al could say to the Electoral College<br>

When the tally is what the tally must be:<br>

``You like me!  You really, really like me!''<br>

Tipper, though thrilled with the second hitch,<br>

Doesn't want to come off like a rhymes-with-rich<br>

And is preparing to do a Liddy Dole,<br>

So, no, she'll have no ``formal role.''<br>

<P>
The kids are fine; each one is thriving.<br>

Karenna's job hunting, Sara is surviving<br>

The SATs and the Achievement Test,<br>
While on Saturdays Al Jr. does his best<br>

To show his savvy: with great aplomb<br>

He turns our Tipper into a Soccer Mom.<br>

Kristin is busy with her college choice,<br>

And has made it clear, in a tone of voice<br>

And with certain words that we can't go printin':<br>

She will not be roommates with Chelsea Clinton.<br>

<P>
But enough about us! This is supposed to be a letter of thanks<br>

To all of our friends at Indonesian banks.<br>

Warm the bourbon and stir the toddy<br>

For our old pal James Riady!<br>

Pop the cork and bang the gong:<br>

We've found Mr. Moneybags -- the Elusive Huang!<br>

So give out a yell, shout out a whoop<br>

For friends of the friends of the Lippo Group!<br>

And thank them for sharing their prosperity,<br>

But what exactly they do is a mystery to me.<br>

<P>
(Don't let our good cheer or flip tone offend ya -- <br>

Campaign Finance Reform is on our agenda.<br>

And stop pointing fingers; don't play the fool.<br>

Remember what happened to big fella Jewell?)<br>

<P>
Let's not stop there! Let the thanking continue<br>

Until the spirit of gratitude is surging in you.<br>

Poor Dick Morris and his upside-down life --<br>
 
Not as upside-down as his unfortunate wife,<br>

I mean the one in Connecticut, not the one in Texas --<br>
 
I think there's only two, I'll check Lexis/Nexis --<br>
 
He deserves our thanks. He was loyal and stout.<br>

(At least until his book comes out.)<br>

<P>
So thank you Dick! The ideological mickeys<br>

That you slipped Stephanopoulos and Ickes<br>

Did the trick. They were silent as stone,<br>

Until the polls closed in the Pacific Time Zone.<br>

It was your work, my friend, to you goes the credit,<br>

I'm only sorry that you'll never be feted.<br>

I remember the day you strode into the room,<br>

And broke through the mire and lifted the gloom,<br>

You scrawled a few words on the whiteboard beside you.<br>

``Listen up,'' you shouted. ``Let these five words guide you.''<br>

You tapped the whiteboard with the pen's plastic tip,<br>

And with five little words you rescued the ship:<br>

Newt's a wacko;<br>

Ban tobacco.<br>

<P>
(Keep in touch; don't be a stranger.<br>

I don't think my nomination's in any danger,<br>

But just in case -- it's a no-brainer -- <br>

I'm enclosing a hefty four-year retainer.)<br>

<P>
Thank you, Bob Reich, and a bouquet of flowers<br>

To the rest of the gang that's off to the showers.<br>

``Know when to say when'' is a saying we know.<br>

There's no shame in quitting -- are you listening, Miss Reno?<br>

<P>
So greetings to all, and to all a big thanks.<br>

We think of you as our '00 piggy banks.<br>

May '97 for all be finer and sweeter.<br>

(Just throw out all direct mail from the Minority Leader.)<br>

<P>
From the entire Gore clan, we wish you good cheer,<br>

During the holiday season and the coming New Year,<br>

Friends and family and presents fantastic,<br>

Under a Christmas tree made of recycled plastic.<br>
