<p><a href="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~pirovich/remail.html">Anonymizer</a><BR>An anonymous remailer is a program that runs on a computer somewhere on the Internet. When you send mail to the remailer address, the remailer takes your name and address off of the mail message and forwards the mail to its destination. The recipient gets mail that has no evidence of where it originally came from, at least not in the headers. You might give away your secret identity in the body of the message, but that would be your own fault. If you need to send an e-mail message in complete privacy this is an excellent way to do so! One very easy way to get prvacy on the Internet is through anonymity. When you don't want your name and e-mail address plastered over your messages then you can use anonymous remailers.

<p><a href="http://dynexcorp.com">Contrarian Foreign Exchange Trading with Market Psychology Strategy (MAPS)</a><BR>Dynex Corporation uses Market Psychology Strategy to achieve profits in the foreign exchange interbank market for its clients: medium size European investment banks, intitutions, investment funds and high-net-worth private investors. Dynex uses proprietary methods to quantify various readings of market psychology. It subsequently enters market positions based on its contrarian strategy. Contrarian trading strategies try to detect when buying power (or selling power) has exhausted itself. Statistics about size and composition of market participants are an invaluable tool. They prove to be most effective when public opinion about market direction has become overwhelmingly one-sided. DYNEX uses carefully designed risk protection methods to provide safety nets against unexpected, adverse price moves. A scaled percentage of equity is risked per trade. For the last 36 months Dynex has achieved an annual (audited) return averaging 20%, net to the investor.  Minimum investment is $500,000.  Smaller investments may achieve the same results through Pan-Forex Fund (not open to U.S. investors).  Currency trading results are typically negatively correlated to stock market returns, and tend to be higher in years of falling stocks. Dynex was ranked 3rd in a recent world-wide survey in BARRON'S magazine for the 12 months ending September 30, 1995. DYNEX points to the increase in market randomness and decline of trending in the major currency markets since their inception. It contends that markets develop from 'baby ' markets to mature markets. Newly opened 'baby ' markets, not being very liquid and therefore more price-driven by way of a lack of opposing market participants, display easy-to-follow trends. As they become mature and develop a large following, their inefficiencies (i.e. their trending and/or cyclical qualities) are 'exploited away' by professional market players who are willing to join new markets only as they become sufficiently liquid. DYNEX expects mature markets to behave in a more choppy fashion, such as the SP500 Index which has become known to be the least suitable trading vehicle for typical systematic trend-following. Today's major currency markets (DEM, JPY, CHF, STG) are mature and are becoming too random for typical trend-following methods to deliver consistently good risk-adjusted returns. The Pacific Rim currencies, on the other hand, are typical 'baby' markets and behave today quite similarly to the way mature markets behaved in the early 1970s. They are therefore still suitable for trend-following methods. The Australian dollar rate (AUD-USD) could be considered a 'teen-ager' within this framework of classification.

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html">MIT distribution site for PGP (Pretty Good Protection)</a><BR>PGP or Pretty Good (TM) Privacy is a high-security cryptographic software application that allows people to exchange messages with both privacy and authentication. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a message can read it. By providing the ability to encrypt messages, PGP provides protection against anyone eavesdropping on the network. Even if a packet is intercepted, it will be unreadable to the snooper. Authentication ensures that a message appearing to be from a particular person can have originated from that person only, and that the message has not been altered. In addition to its support for messages, PGP also enables you to encrypt files stored on your computer. Works under any operating system and is virtually impossible to crack the code!MIT distributes PGP free for non-commercial use. This distribution is done in cooperation with Philip Zimmermann, the author of PGP, and with RSA Data Security, Inc., which licenses patents to the public-key encryption technology on which PGP relies.

<p><b>Introduction to Interactive Concepts</b>

<p>We are excited about the opportunity to create one of the first sites on the
World Wide devoted exclusively for personal investments.  In addition,
Interactive Concepts is also developing various on-line techniques for the
purchase, sale and tracking of direct public offering issues. Our team of
highly qualified individuals who are specialists in their respective fields
help assist in creating high-end web site for the financial community.  This
degree of expertise will be important in the development of web technology
that provides both compelling content to its users and a forum for searching
and analyzing other companies in the secondary markets.

<p><b>Background </b>

<p>Technological advances in software and hardware have made it possible for
almost anyone with a computer, a modem, and a telephone line to gain access
to various online services.  A user who has a connection to the Internets
World Wide Web can now access a variety of financial services not offered by
commercial online services such as America Online and CompuServe.

<p>In 1995, the number of commercial addresses on the Internet rose almost
six-fold to 170,000 says Internet Info, a Falls Church, Va., research firm.
 The number of financial sites on the Web soared in 1995 to almost 20,000
from fewer than 1,700 a year earlier, according to 
<a href="http://www.directory.net/">Open Market Inc</a>, an electronic-commerce firm in Cambridge, Ma.,
which tracks commercial sites.
<p>
One of the significant areas of growth in the online world involves financial
based Web sites that attracts both Wall Street companies as well as
individual investors seeking to find niche investment information residing on
the Internet.  The trend since the early 1980s is that both brokerage firms,
mutual fund companies and individual investors are aggressively utilizing
online services to conduct investment research as well as placing trades
online through the various Web-based brokerage firms (Charles Schwab,
Fidelity Investments, E*Trade being the largest on the Web) and those found
on services such as America Online, CompuServe, Quick and Reilly, and
Waterhouse Securities, to name a few.  With current technology, online
investing and trading is about to take a new level of sophistication.

<p>
As customers and brokers become more acclimated to using the Web for
purchasing securities directly from sponsoring companies, it is expected that
Web based transaction could likely overtake retail trading of equities the
next fifteen years.  Interactive Concepts development team is poised to
create one of the first truly Internet trading system in which buyers and
sellers can meet directly at a companies secured Web site, bypassing
traditional exchanges.  Already a handful of Web sites are taking orders for
exchange-listed securities such as Charles Schwab and Lombard Institutional
Brokerage.  These companies are reporting tremendous receptivity among the
investing public.  Industry analysts believe that electronic brokerage firms
today are growing faster today than any other means of computerized
order-taking; one day, the Internet could dominate that business.  It is
interesting to note that Lombard Institutional Brokerage company are working
an off the exchange model currently in development called InstaNet .  This
system is a series of unregulated computerized trading systems, which allows
securities dealers and institutional investors to trade shares among
themselves, bypassing the exchanges.  While closed to retail investors and
not part of the Internet, the system is heavily used by giant institutions,
primarily for trading NASDAQ-listed stocks.  This paradigm applied to retail
investors for direct stock purchase is the unique position in which
Interactive Concept positions itself in.  Through the companys Web site,
both companies and individuals will have an electronic market for their
shares to trade and supply liquidity to companies going the public using the
direct public auction process making its emergence after the initial success
of Spring Street Brewing and Real Good Trading Corporation with the
successful placement of .6 million dollars of stock.

<BR>
<B>Why is getting your financial based Web-site listed on our directory so
effective in building traffic and exposure? <BR></B>
<BR>
What is the very first thing that you did when you first accessed the
Internet?  You went to a directory or search engine and typed in a word(s)
relating to a subject that interested you.  You then went to the web-site
that came up on the list that closest met your criteria. If it was not
listed, you simply didn't go there.  This is the primary way that people
find what they are looking for on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Why do I need to be listed on Money$earch? Isn't Yahoo enough? <BR></B>
<BR>
When it comes to the Internet, your money and investment related site can
never get too much exposure.  Many of our directories on our site receive
thousands of visitors (not to be confused with "hits") every day.  You want
to make sure that your site is found by anyone searching the net for a site
containing your investment subject matter.  Every link to your home page is
like having another front door to your web page.  Just browse some
of our directories with descriptions.  In addition, to being listed on
hundreds of sites on the Internet, our site has gained notoriety with
several financial publications including <i>Inc.</i>, <i>Investor's Business
Daily</i>, and <i>Money Magazine</i> to name a few.<BR>
<BR>
While a larger, more popular directory gets more traffic, your listing is
one of tens of thousands.  In a smaller, less popular directory you may be
the only business of your type. With that in mind,  we are search engine
that is segmented towards investors and we do not intend to become the
general search site like all the others.  We are specialists!  All of our
listing are consistent in instruction and format.  This ease of Interface
has made us a
popular site on the net for the discriminating investor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you add these submissions automatically using a program or script? <BR></B>
<BR>
To maintain the absolute highest quality, we attempt to visit each site on
the list before posting it for public viewing.  Of course, due to the heavy
volume of sites submitted we do not provide any evaluation of the accuracy
or reliability of the site or it's content. <BR>
<BR>
After viewing the site, we post the site in the most appropriate section.
If the site does not match any groupings, we will evaluate the notion of
adding a new category.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How long will it take before my web site is listed on Money$earch?<BR></B>
<BR>
From the time that you submit the registration form, it will take about one
week for us to complete the submission.  During periods of heavy volume of
registrations, it is more realistic to expect up to two weeks before your
site is listed<BR>
<BR>
<B>How will I know when you are done? <BR></B>
<BR>
When complete, we will send you an e-mail message entitled "Your site has
been added". The message will include the complete listing of your site. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How will you know which category to place your site in ? <BR></B>
<BR>
The first thing we do, before submitting to the Money$earch database is to
preview your Web site.  We evaluate your Web site and try to get an idea of
it's substance. This way, when we get to the submissions, we can better fit
you into the appropriate directory or category. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Why should I register with Money$earch today? <BR></B>
<BR>
Just observe how fast the Internet is growing.  It is simply amazing to look
at the figures. You need to establish your presence now!  Before all the
directories start charging for listings, before it becomes more difficult
and more expensive to get exposure, and most important of all, before your
competition, if this applies to your line of financial or investment work! <BR>
<BR>
<B>Why should I advertise my web site on Money$earch?<BR></B>
<BR>
Quality, quality, quality!  We re-evaluate our database list on an ongoing
basis.  Our site has gained the reputation among online enthusiasts who use
their computerized investors as the premier location to find what they are
looking for.  The internet is changing constantly, so any quality service
must change with it.  If you plan to advertise on a different directory
listing service, first ask them (if you can get them on the phone) how
they keep up with the changing directories.  There are many reasons to
choose us to help you promote your web site, but quality and reputation is
number one.  If you would like to request a media kit regarding our rates
and profile of visitors to our site, please e-mail <A HREF="mailto:advertise@moneysearch.com">

Thanks to a special limited-time offer from Microsoft, you can read the Web's leading source of business news at no charge until the end of December. And as a user of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, you'll also be able to take advantage of all the Interactive Edition's latest features and conveniences.<p>

This free subscription plan requires that you use Internet Explorer each time you access the Interactive Edition through Dec. 31, 1996. Use the most recent version of Internet Explorer available for your operating system. <b>Please Note: If you're running Windows 95, you must use Explorer 3.0; previous versions, including 3.0 beta versions, do not apply to this offer. </b> If you have questions, call Customer Service at 1-800-369-2834 or 609-514-0870, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-9 p.m. ET.<p>

<HR>
<p><b>If you have not yet subscribed to  the Interactive Edition...</b> 
<ul>
<li><b> And you're using Internet Explorer now,</b> just <A HREF="/regchoice.html"> subscribe </A> to the Interactive Edition today. Your subscription is free, courtesy of Microsoft, through Dec. 31, 1996.
</li>

<li><b> And you're not yet using Internet Explorer,</b> <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">download</A> version 3.0 for Windows 95 (or other Internet Explorer version that works with your operating system) to qualify for this special offer. </li>
</UL>

</p>

<HR>
<p> <b> If you already subscribe to the Interactive Edition...</b>
<ul>

<li><B>And you're using Internet Explorer now</B>, just access the <A HREF="/edition/current/summaries/front.htm">Front Page </a> as you normally would. You <b>don't</b> need to re-register; just use your existing User Name and Password.</li>

<li> <b> And you're not yet using Internet Explorer,</b> <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">download</A> version 3.0 for Windows 95 (or other Internet Explorer version that works with your operating system) now. When you return to the Interactive Edition and sign on using Internet Explorer, we'll automatically make sure your access remains free through Dec. 31, 1996.

<LI><b>If you gave us your credit card when you registered and you wish to take advantage of this offer</b>, you actually need to <A HREF="/user-cgi-bin/UserMenu.html">cancel</A> your subscription so you won't be billed; this won't, however, affect your User Name and Password and you will be able to access the Interactive Edition as long as you're online with Internet Explorer. If, however, you use a variety of browsers and wish to continue as a paid subscriber, don't cancel your subscription. If you're a subscriber who signed on prior to Aug. 1, 1996, just consider this special offer an extension of your free trial period; you will not be required to provide credit card information until Jan. 1, 1997.

another was a resurgence in the popularity of indexing, and the third was
the increasing importance of mutual funds.<br>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions -- <br>
Special Offer from Microsoft Internet Explorer</h2>





<p><b>I don't have Windows 95. Can I still qualify for this special offer?</b> <br>



 Of course. This promotion started with Microsoft's launch of its new Internet Explorer 3.0 for Windows 95, which is the company's state-of-the-art Web browser software--and the version that allows you to use some great shortcuts and other navigational tools we've developed exclusively for use with Internet Explorer 3.0.  However, as long as you're using Internet Explorer, you can get the Interactive Edition free, courtesy of Microsoft, through the end of 1996. To locate the version you should download, visit Microsoft's Internet Explorer site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie"> http://www.microsoft.com/ie </A>. (Please note: If you are using Windows 95, you must use the commercial release version 3.0. Previous releases or beta versions of 3.0 don't qualify.) 



<p><b>How will you know if I'm using Internet Explorer and what happens if I'm not?</b> <br>



Our system will detect that you're using Internet Explorer and will authorize your access each time you sign on to the Interactive Edition. If you're using someone else's computer or another browser, you'll get a message reminding you that you must use Internet Explorer to take advantage of this special arrangement. If you wish to use multiple browsers between now and the end of the year, you should sign up as a standard, paid subscriber.</p>



<p><b>I already subscribe to the Interactive Edition but I don't use Internet Explorer. Once I download Explorer and begin using it, should I cancel my Interactive Edition subscription and re-register to qualify for this special offer?</b> <br>


No, not if you subscribed to the Interactive Edition prior to Aug. 1, 1996; we'll automatically make sure you get continued free access through Dec. 31, 1996. Please note: If you gave us your credit card number when you subscribed (which means you subscribed after Aug. 1, 1996), you'll need to actually cancel that subscription; don't worry, your existing User Name and Password will work for this special offer. The only difference: You won't be billed until Jan. 1, 1997! The first time you sign on using Internet Explorer, you'll get a message that includes a link to the cancellation page--and complete instructions for how to proceed--if you wish to take advantage of this offer.




<p><b>What happens when this special offer ends on Dec. 31, 1996?</b> <br>



You'll be given the chance to subscribe to the Interactive Edition directly. An annual subscription costs $49 or $29 if you subscribe to the print edition of the Journal.

<p>Cheers! The mutual-fund celebration is still going strong, with
investors basking in the glow of an average 19.5% return for diversified
U.S. stock funds in 1996. Added to the previous year's huge 31.1% return,
the nation's stock funds as a group now have delivered 56 cents in profit
for every dollar invested as 1995 began.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"It was almost like coining money," says A. Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a Summit, N.J., firm that tracks
mutual-fund performance. Little wonder that investors have poured record
sums into stock mutual funds in the past year, boosting the assets of all
mutual funds to $3.5 trillion, or five times the level of a decade ago.</p>
<p>The average bond fund gained a less festive 4.7% in 1996, according to
Lipper, trailing the 4.8% average yield on money-market funds sold to
individual investors, as estimated by IBC's Money Fund Report, of Ashland,
Mass.</p>
<p>The very exuberance of the stock-market gala worries many fund-industry
veterans. In particular, they fear that small investors are intoxicated
with their recent gains and are paying too little attention to the
potential hangover.</p>
<p>"People seem to have their foot to the accelerator looking for maximum
returns," says John Brennan, president of Vanguard Group. The Valley Forge,
Pa., concern the nation's second-largest mutual-fund company in terms of
assets, after Fidelity Investments. Although many investment professionals
are bracing for a stock-market tumble, he says, "I sense less nervousness
on the individual side."</p>
<p>Mutual-fund investors who participated in a just-released survey
commissioned by Montgomery Asset Management certainly are an optimistic
bunch. Interviewed in November, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was
steaming ahead after crossing the 6000 milestone, one-third of the
respondents venturing a guess expected the industrials to end 1997 at 7000
or higher. In fact, 13% envisioned the 30-stock average at 7500 or more.
Only 5% predicted a tumble below 5000.</p>
<p>But some investment professionals believe this year's stock market will
be a rough one that forces revelers to sober up.</p>
<p>"I would be surprised if we get through another year without a 10%
decline somewhere in the year" in the prices of large U.S. stocks, says M.
David Testa, director of the stock division of T. Rowe Price Associates in
Baltimore. Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer of U.S. Trust in New
York, is counseling clients to expect what he calls "a bear market in time"
--- that is, not a precipitous market collapse, but possibly years of
anemic returns.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to fund investors isn't the obvious one of losing
money in a market meltdown, Mr. Lipper says. Rather, "it's them panicking
at the bottom and leaving the game." Like other investment professionals,
he notes that stocks have usually beaten other investment vehicles over
periods of 20 years or more. If a market swoon prompts some people to swear
off stock funds altogether, Mr. Lipper says, they could wind up with too
little money for retirement or other long-term goals.</p>
<p>The end of the calendar year, and the imminent arrival of year-end fund
statements in the mail, provide an opportune time for individual investors
to reflect on how well their fund portfolios might weather a downturn.
Although stock funds are the best choice for long-term investing, Mr.
Lipper recommends putting some money into super-safe money-market funds in
order to "strengthen intestinal fortitude" and make it easier to hang onto
stock funds during inevitable bear markets.</p>
<p>Investment advisers typically recommend that investors put some money
into bonds and international stocks, and some market watchers are
particularly bullish on those investment options right now. Mr. Brennan of
Vanguard predicts that bonds will give stocks "very tough competition" in
investment returns over the next five to 10 years. Carol McMullen, a senior
investment officer at Putnam Investments in Boston, says international
stock markets as a group "are well-positioned for good growth and not
overvalued."</p>
<p>U.S. Trust predicts that in 1997, both bonds and international stocks
will deliver higher returns than U.S. stocks, as measured by Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index. But getting investors to move dollars out of the
U.S. stock market can be tough, Mr. Taylor says. Clients remember that he
and many other market watchers were similarly cautious on the U.S. market a
year ago. After a second bang-up year for U.S. stocks, he says, "it's a
little harder to lower client expectations."</p>
<p>The huge run-up in the U.S. stock market has brought warm and fuzzy
feelings to legions of mutual-fund investors. And the Montgomery Asset
Management survey suggests that most of them aren't focusing on a
performance yardstick that consumes fund managers, namely the ability of
funds to keep up with closely watched market benchmarks such as the S&amp;P
500 and the Dow Jones industrials.</p>
<p>Asked how their fund holdings have performed relative to "the stock
market in general," 53% of the investors surveyed asserted that their funds
had performed "in line with" the market, and 37% said they had done better.
A mere 10% said that their fund holdings had done worse than the
market.</p>
<p>Dream on. The reality is that in 1996, as in 1995, the majority of stock
funds lagged behind both the S&amp;P and the Dow Jones average, two
benchmarks that investors tend to think of as "the market." Only 25% of
diversified U.S. stock funds beat the S&amp;P 500 in 1996, according to
Lipper. The figure in 1995 was an even lower 16%. The average 19.5% return
posted by diversified U.S. stock funds for 1996 trailed a 22.96% advance in
the S&amp;P and an even racier 28.71% surge in the Dow Jones industrials.
(All of these Lipper figures are total returns, encompassing both the
impact of fund share-price changes and the reinvestment of dividends.)</p>
<p>Does this mean that investors ought to start 1997 by ditching "actively
managed" funds in favor of "index" funds that simply buy and hold the
stocks making up a benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500? Not so fast.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 and related index funds "will not outperform
continually," declares Mr. Brennan of Vanguard, whose Vanguard Index Trust
500 Portfolio is the third-largest stock fund. A crucial reason that so
many funds have trailed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark is simply corporate size:
The largest companies have recently been the best performers in the stock
market and those stocks make up the S&amp;P 500 and Dow benchmarks. By
contrast, most actively managed stock funds hold a mix of large and smaller
stock issues.</p>
<p>Investment professionals are more divided than usual on whether smaller
stocks or large ones will do better this year.</p>
<p>The pros certainly got mixed signals in the fourth quarter, when returns
on various stock-fund categories were all over the lot. It was a robust
quarter overall, with the average diversified stock fund gaining just under
5%, according to Lipper. Funds specializing in shares of small and
medium-size companies, on average, were up less than half as much.</p>
<p>But within those small and midsize stock-fund categories, there were
some sharp differences depending on whether funds buy fast-growing
high-priced "growth" stocks or out-of-favor "value" issues. According to
fund researchers at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, the average small-company
growth fund actually lost 1.8% for investors in the three months through
December. Midcap growth funds were up less than 1%. Funds in those two
groups ended up as "weaklings" after being the top-performing "glamour
funds" of 1995 and early 1996, says Morningstar's publisher, John
Rekenthaler.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, small value funds and midcap value funds, which had been left
in the dust in 1995 and early 1996, were among the fourth quarter's best
performers, returning 7.5% and 8.4%, respectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Rekenthaler believes this year's market, like that of the fourth
quarter, will favor smaller value funds over smaller growth. The value
funds hold stocks that are still reasonably priced, he says, and they might
actually beat the S&amp;P 500 if the stock market continues edging up. Some
funds he likes: Skyline Special Equities Fund, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock
Fund, T. Rowe Price Over-the-Counter Securities Fund and the small,
little-known Schroder U.S. Smaller Companies Fund.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Morningstar publisher worries that smaller growth funds,
particularly those holding stocks trading at 30 or more times company
earnings, will get creamed in any downturn. Lots of investors rushed into
these funds in 1995 and 1996, he says, and stock-price declines will be
exacerbated if those investors start barreling out. He is leery of selected
funds from the Aim, Alger, American Century (Twentieth Century), PBHG and
Van Wagoner fund groups.</p>
<p>Besides holding a mix of large-stock and small-stock funds, investors
may want to direct a small portion of their stock-investment dollars into
funds that buy specific types of stocks. For instance, Mr. Rekenthaler is
keen on utility-stock funds, which he figures are due for a rebound after
years of weak performance and investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>Ronald Roge, a financial adviser in Centereach, N.Y., suggests clients
keep a slug of money parked in natural-resources funds and real-estate
funds. Those investments sometimes zig when the market zags, he explains,
which "helps us control some of the volatility in the portfolio."</p>
<p>Those two categories actually turned out to be top performers in 1996,
and particularly the fourth quarter: Real-estate funds rose a steep 15.9%
in the quarter, according to Lipper, bringing them to a 30.8% return for
the year. The top 11 funds for the quarter were real-estate funds, led by
CGM Realty Fund, up almost 22%. Occupancy rates and rents have been rising,
and the high yields on many real-estate stocks make them attractive to
cautious investors. Natural-resources funds, which hold energy and metals
stocks, returned 8.9% in the quarter and 32.7% for the full year.</p>
<p>Mr. Roge uses T. Rowe Price New Era Fund for natural-resources exposure,
and for real estate, he favors Cohen &amp; Steers Realty Shares and
Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">The $100 Billion Fund Question:<br>
What's the Right Level of Cash?</h2>

<p><b>By R<font size="-1">OBERT</font> M<font size="-1">C</font>G<font size="-1">OUGH</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>It is the $100 billion question in the mutual-fund industry: With stock
funds' sliver of cash at such a low percentage, should everybody be
scared?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>This is a figure that industry veterans watch like hawks. The cash
holdings of stock funds at last count, at the end of November, stood at a
stingy 5.8%, down from as much as 13% in 1990. In the eyes of some people,
it all adds up to a world where money managers have become too bullish,
investing hand-over-fist and leaving their wallets too skinny to keep the
stock-market boom going.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to look at the cash statistic a bit more closely.
One is that the small percentage of assets stock funds have parked in cash
nonetheless represents $100 billion -- or a healthy 5.7 days' trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. In January 1992, stock funds held a more
comfortable-sounding 7.2% of their assets in cash -- but that sum was
equivalent to only 3.4 days' trading on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is that there have been long stretches of time when cash
levels at stock funds have been even lower than they are now -- and stocks
did fine.</p>
<p>In January 1955, the managers of mutual funds had cut their cash
holdings to a bare-bones 4.9% of assets. But that year, stocks had total
returns (including dividends) of 31.6%, according to Ibbotson Associates of
Chicago.</p>
<p>In fact, from the mid-1950s, when cash holdings of funds were first
compiled, through the early 1960s, cash regularly made up only 4.5% to 7%
of the portfolios of stock funds. And that period was largely wonderful for
the stock market.</p>
<p>Alas, no single indicator will tell investors whether stocks have topped
out or are poised instead to hit even more new highs. So this is a good
time for investors to have a little humility, and to remember the wisdom of
diversification.</p>
<p>Different asset classes -- U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, bonds and cash
-- will perform differently over time, helping to even out the swings in a
portfolio's value.</p>
<p>Nowadays, analysts are paying especially close attention to cash levels
of funds because mutual funds have become behemoths in the stock market.
Mutual funds now account for the equivalent of more than 48% of the trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Birinyi Associates, in
Greenwich, Conn. That is up from 10% in 1980.</p>
<p>Many investors are familiar with the idea that the sums of money pouring
into stock funds -- a record $210 billion in the first 11 months of 1996 --
has helped fuel the rally in stocks the past couple of years. Less widely
noted is the possibility that funds might one day have to sell stocks to
pay off departing investors, an action that could accelerate any
stock-price dive.</p>
<p>"At some point you're going to have a down market," says Melissa Brown,
director of quantitative analysis at Prudential Securities, in New York.
"I'm concerned about what investors are going to do with their assets."</p>
<p>The worry is about whether fund investors cut and run. "As long as money
continues to come into funds, the low cash levels are not a problem," Ms.
Brown says. "Where it becomes a problem is if for one reason or another,
people decide to slow down their investments or to shift their money out of
stock funds. Then you've got an issue of low liquidity and selling. You
could possibly run into the problem of managers having to sell stocks just
to meet redemptions."</p>
<p>That's the theory. But has it worked out that way in the past?</p>
<p>Ms. Brown points out that stock funds held less than 5.5% of their
portfolios in cash in 1972 and 1973, two of the bleakest years on record
for the stock market. But stock funds also had less than 5.5% of their
portfolios in cash in 1971, which wasn't such a bad year.</p>
<p>And what about those low levels of cash in the latter half of the
buoyant 1950s stock market? "The major difference between then and now is
stocks probably [on average sold] at eight times earnings in the 50s," Ms.
Brown says. Nowadays, they sell at 21 times trailing earnings. "So you were
probably dealing with a market that was a lot less risky."</p>
<p>Cash holdings may give some indication of money-manager sentiment. But
they are part of a much larger equation. Low levels of cash in a cheap
stock market may suggest less risk than higher levels of cash in a pricey
one.</p>
<p>Analyst Laszlo Birinyi, founder of Birinyi Associates, isn't worried at
all about low levels of cash in the average fund. He takes comfort in what
he calls the "buying power" of stock-fund cash.</p>
<p>As discussed above, stock funds had more than $100 billion in cash at
last count, or the equivalent of 5.7 days' trading on the Big Board. That's
plenty of fuel for the stock market, Mr. Birinyi says. This buying-power
indicator was at about the current level back in February and March of
1996. Though technology stocks subsequently hit a rough patch, the broader
market averages are up nearly 20% since March 1.</p>
<p>The highest his indicator has reached was 9.1 days of buying power, in
July 1994, and it was also at about nine days in August 1996. Shortly after
that, stocks took off. Because of the growth of mutual funds and their huge
influence on the stock market, Mr. Birinyi says, "the marketplace is
changing," and he says his buying-power indicator better reflects that
change.</p>
<p>The lowest this indicator showed was 1.4 days of trading power in
October 1982. Did this presage a bad market? Not really: The stock market
had begun what would become a huge bull market, and managers were busy
buying stocks. Mr. Birinyi thinks his indicator has been more predictive in
recent years, since mutual funds grew in importance to the market.</p>
<p>No doubt, one day the stock market will take a tumble. And if it occurs
while stock funds have only light holdings of cash, fund managers may be
forced to sell stocks to pay off departing shareholders -- worsening the
decline.</p>
<p>But are stock-fund cash measures "predictive"? That's something we'll
only know in retrospect.</p>

<p>Got a hunch? Bet a bunch.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The victors in the latest mutual-fund performance race followed similar
stock-picking strategies: fattening up on favorites instead of spreading
their risks. Such high-wire gambits pay off, of course, when the manager
concentrates on the right names. Choose the wrong ones, and returns
collapse.</p>
<p>The top fund last year was State Street Research Global Resources,
managed by Daniel J. Rice. He piled as much as 40% of the portfolio's
assets in oil-service companies, even though the market capitalization of
that sector makes up only 8% of the energy industry. Both the five-year
winner, Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio, and the 10-year champion,
Seligman Communications &amp; Information fund, poured as much as 45% and
30% of their assets, respectively, into their top 10 holdings last year.
Stock funds on average invest about 25% of their portfolios in their top
picks.</p>
<p>The three funds' performances underscore that conviction and steely
nerves are required to land a manager at the top of the fund heap.</p>
<p>"A lot of managers have big mood swings on technology and get disgusted
with the sector," says Paul Wick of Seligman Communications &amp;
Information. "But I've always been an optimist."</p>
<p><b>ONE-YEAR WINNER:</b> The five-year high
that oil prices reached in 1996 helped power the Class A shares of State
Street Global Resources to a 70.25% return last year. Oil-exploration
companies benefited, but Mr. Rice's beloved oil-service companies did even
better. Two of Mr. Rice's best picks were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=atwd&amp;page=15">Atwood Oceanics</a>, which surged
152%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=esv&amp;page=15">Ensco
International</a>, which rose 111%. Consolidation in the oil patch
also buoyed Global Resource's gains; four of its top 10 holdings, including
Ensco, were acquired by other companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice shuns big issues such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mob&amp;page=15">Mobil</a> and prefers relatively obscure
companies with strong cash flow. His current favorites include
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nev&amp;page=15">Nuevo Energy</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sgo&amp;page=15">Seagull Energy</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ne m&amp;page=15">Noble Drilling</a>.</p>
<p>"We want to get into ponds that not too many people fish in," he says.
"We try not to live off the Street." Mr. Rice manages $1 billion in assets
at State Street Research &amp; Management (which is a subsidiary of
Metropolitan Life Insurance, but not affiliated with State Street Bank).
Most of that money is institutional. His State Street Research Global
Resources fund had $121 million in assets as of Dec. 31.</p>
<p><b>FIVE-YEAR WINNER:</b> Fidelity Select
Electronics, whose five-year returns were 373.78%, had four managers during
the period. But its continued strong returns are testimony to Fidelity's
deep bench.</p>
<p>The $1.4 billion fund's current captain, Andrew Kaplan, 33 years old,
took over in August. Mr. Kaplan, noting that the price of computer memory
chips was dropping when he took over, bought personal-computer makers such
as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dell&amp;page=15">Dell
Computer</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq Computer</a>,
and disk-drive maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=seg&amp;page=15">Seagate
Technology</a>. He also bought analog-circuit maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mxim&amp;page=15">Maxim Integrated Products</a>.</p>
<p>Shareholders in the fund got a total return of nearly 42% in 1996.</p>
<p>When he joined Fidelity in 1995, Mr. Kaplan was a semiconductor analyst,
and he says his job differs little now that he is managing a so-called
sector fund. At Fidelity, sector-fund managers, like analysts, are
responsible for recommending companies to managers of the company's mammoth
diversified funds, and Mr. Kaplan judges his performance on his ability to
convince those managers to buy the stocks he touts.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaplan remains "pretty bullish" on PCs. But he says last year's
overlooked semiconductor segments, such as communications and analog-device
concerns, will be particularly strong.</p>
<p><b>10-YEAR WINNER:</b> This was not an easy
year for Mr. Wick, a 33-year-old manager whose Seligman Communications
&amp; Information fund has gained 693.51% over 10 years. (Mr. Wick has run
the fund since 1990.) In March, his assistant left. Mr. Wick then spent
time helping his firm open a new office in Palo Alto, Calif. Most
importantly, the semiconductor industry stumbled in the first half of the
year, causing Mr. Wick's fund to fall 16% in the seven months through July.
The fund recovered to end the year up nearly 12%.</p>
<p>In the second half, Mr. Wick invested heavily in PC makers Dell, Compaq,
and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=gate&amp;page=15">Gateway
2000</a>, as well as hardware and peripheral companies such as
Seagate.</p>
<p>Mr. Wick says he expects consistent, high returns to continue as
technology permeates more parts of society. He sees continued strength in
the PC market, but his large positions in
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=stk&amp;page=15">Storage Technology</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=csco&amp;page=15">Cisco Systems</a> reflect his view that storage and
data-networking companies will perform well this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Wick says his job has gotten tougher: Assets in the fund's Class A
shares have surged to $2.5 billion, from $307 million in 1994. "Size
definitely affects performance, and anyone who tells you differently is
kidding himself," he says. He cannot move in and out of stocks as quickly
as he once could, and he needs to find companies with large enough market
capitalizations -- say, over $5 billion -- to really make a dent in his
portfolio.</p>
<p>Should investors take their money to smaller funds?</p>
<p>Of course not, Mr. Wick says: "We have the infrastructure in place to
better accommodate size."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Managers Stick With Stocks<br>
Despite an Uncertain Outlook</h2>

<p><b>By J<font size="-1">OHN</font> R. D<font size="-1">ORFMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>For two years, the U.S. stock market has soared like an eagle. In 1997,
the managers of some of the nation's largest mutual funds expect it to look
more like a turkey.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Nevertheless, these managers are not taking defensive steps, such as
raising cash or increasing their holdings of foreign stocks. Instead, they
are pretty much sticking to their normal investment blends. To an extent,
the managers are responding to public demand. For the past two years, the
U.S. stock market has been a great place to be, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising more than 33% in 1995 and 26% in 1996. Managers
worry that they will suffer the same fate as Jeff Vinik, the manager of
Fidelity Magellan Fund, who departed Fidelity after falling behind the
market because he had lightened up on stocks.</p>
<p>Still, fund managers say they aren't sticking to their investment blends
-- their heavy allocation of money into U.S. stocks instead of cash, bonds
or foreign securities -- because they are being bullied into it. Rather,
they say, they are adhering to their investment philosophies. Besides,
experience has taught them that no one can predict the markets ... not even
themselves.</p>
<p>Here's a look at what managers of three of the country's largest funds
are doing with their portfolios now.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Fidelity Growth &amp; Income Fund</b></p>
<p>Steven M. Kaye, manager of Fidelity Growth &amp; Income Fund in Boston,
thinks the fountain of gains that has spurted for the past two years will
slow to a trickle. He believes the Dow Jones Industrial Average will end
1997 "within a range of plus or minus 10%" from its starting point of
6448.27.</p>
<p>"The stock market is at 21 times trailing earnings," an unusually high
level, he says. "The rate environment is favorable, but it will be a tough
year... . I don't see a recession punishing the market. But to expect
anything near the past two years is not reasonable."</p>
<p>If the U.S. market looks uninspiring, what about foreign stocks? Mr.
Kaye says he has his normal quota of 5% to 10% of the portfolio abroad.
"The story [on a foreign stock] has to be that much better [than on a
domestic one] to compensate for the currency risk," he says. In his view,
the economy in Japan "is getting worse," while Europe is "not that
strong."</p>
<p>Fidelity Growth &amp; Income is the nation's fifth-largest stock fund
with some $24 billion in assets. In 1996, it underperformed Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index, with a 20% return, compared with nearly 23% for the
index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Mr. Kaye blames that on his
reluctance to buy such high-flying stocks as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ko&amp;page=15">Coca-Cola</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=msft&amp;page=15">Microsoft</a>. But he has no intention of
buying them now, saying "there doesn't appear to be any room for error in
the stocks."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye's favorite group at the moment is drug stocks. "A few years ago
they were value stocks. Today they're momentum stocks," he says. "New
products are being approved rather quickly. And unit growth is as good as
I've ever seen it." As of the fund's latest report,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bmy&amp;page=15">Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> was his largest
holding in the group.</p>
<p>He also likes defense and aerospace, "a consolidating industry with very
favorable cash flow." His biggest holding in the group recently was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a>, "a boring name that nobody would think
of," but which "has quietly doubled in about the last three years."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye is going light on cyclical stocks because he is "concerned
about corporate earnings." He also is wary of bank stocks. "The market
seems to think there will never be another credit cycle," he says, "but
history has a tendency to repeat itself."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Vanguard/Windsor Fund</b></p>
<p>"If I got paid for my stock-market prognostications, I'd be out of
here," says Charles Freeman, who has just completed his first year running
the Vanguard/Windsor Fund after taking it over from investment legend John
Neff.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman says he had predicted a flat market in 1996. Luckily, he
didn't invest on that premise, and enjoyed a good year with a 26.4% return,
more than three percentage points above the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>The fund, based in Valley Forge, Pa., has close to $17 billion in
assets, making it the nation's ninth largest. It is closed to new
investors.</p>
<p>A belief that it's unwise to try to time the markets is one of the few
factors separating his style from that of his predecessor, Mr. Freeman
says. Mr. Neff used to raise cash when he thought the stock market was
about to hit the rocks. The cash level was 20% when Mr. Freeman took over
last January, but he has been gradually working it down. "We will run fully
invested," he declares. Though he won't act on his hunch, Mr. Freeman
guesses that 1997 will be "flat at best." He thinks the overall stock
market is 10% to 15% overvalued, though he believes his own portfolio of
bargain-priced stocks is actually undervalued.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman has only about 6% of his portfolio in foreign issues. "At
the margin, our foreign exposure is increasing," he says. But he buys
foreign stocks only when they provide "a cheaper alternative to domestic
issues," as with
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rpr&amp;page=15">Rhone Poulenc</a>,
the French drug manufacturer.</p>
<p>One of his recent purchases is
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a>, accumulated over a
period of three months. As Mr. Neff frequently did, Mr. Freeman bought
heavily when bad news depressed the stock -- first when the company
announced that third-quarter profit would be disappointing, and then when
the stock dipped in reaction to the naming of John R. Walter as chief
executive. Mr. Freeman also is a strong proponent of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=c&amp;page=15">Chrysler</a> shares, recently at a dirt-cheap
six times earnings. Most investors view the auto companies' recent earnings
as unsustainable, but Mr. Freeman figures Chrysler could astound the
critics by earning $3 a share in a recession, rather than losing money as
most expect.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>New Perspective Fund</b></p>
<p>Here is one fund that has two-thirds of its assets outside the U.S., but
not because it has a bearish outlook on the U.S. market. As a global fund,
it always diversifies its holdings among many nations.</p>
<p>With close to $13 billion in assets, New Perspective is the 18th-largest
fund in the country. It is part of the American Funds family, run by
Capital Research &amp; Management in Los Angeles. Gina Despres, the fund's
president, says it has about 35% of its assets in North American stocks,
10% in Asia and 40% in Europe. The other 15% is in cash.</p>
<p>Those percentages change only mildly from year to year, Ms. Despres
says. The fund has extremely low turnover -- only 18% in 1996, for example.
The country allocation isn't planned, she says; it is a byproduct of stock
selection. Recently, New Perspective's five biggest stockholdings were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=a&amp;page=15">Astra</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mo&amp;page=15">Philip Morris</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mnnsy&amp;page=15">Mannesmann</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=abbby&amp;page=15">ABB</a> (formerly
Brown Boveri) and Ciba-Geigy. All are multinationals, as are virtually all
the fund's holdings.</p>
<p>Capital Research uses a multimanager system. For example, the New
Perspective Fund is sliced into six pieces, five of them run by five
different portfolio managers and the sixth by a team of research analysts.
The managers consult regularly with one another, but make decisions
independently. In recent years, New Perspective has lagged behind the
S&amp;P 500, which gauges the U.S. market, but has beaten the Morgan
Stanley world index. The fund returned 17.3% last year.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bond Funds May Beat Stocks,<br>
But Will They Have Investors?</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REGORY</font> Z<font size="-1">UCKERMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>This may be the year that bond funds finally beat stock funds. But will
there be many investors in bond funds to celebrate?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's the question on the lips of bond-fund managers following a
lackluster 1996. Money flowed out of almost every type of bond fund.
Instead, investors flocked to stocks, where they captured double-digit
gains.</p>
<p>Now bonds are due for their day in the sun, says a confident Bill
Dawson, chief investment officer of mutual-fund company Federated Research.
"Stocks will have a tough time beating bonds this year."</p>
<p>But few fund investors are flocking to the party. A mere $10.30 billion
moved into bond funds in the 11 months through Nov. 30, according to the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade group for mutual
funds. That pales in comparison with stock funds, which took in $210
billion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the inflow into bond funds was spotty. Cash bled out of bond
funds during four of the final six months through Nov. 30. And if you
exclude high-yield bonds, which many view as stock-bond hybrids that have
more of the attributes of stocks than bonds, fund investors actually
withdrew money from bond funds over the year.</p>
<p>That outflow trend likely won't be reversed in a hurry.</p>
<p>"It will take a while for potentially mediocre results of the stock
market to work their way into bond-fund sales," says Bill Gross, who
manages $81 billion at Pacific Investment Management. "The second half of
the year would be a more logical entry point" for any resurgence of
interest.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>A Rebound From Two Grim Years</b></p>
<p>That bond funds got any money at all last year was an improvement. In
1995, bond funds had outflows of $4.81 billion, while investors pulled out
more than $43 billion during the bruising bond market of 1994, according to
ICI.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for the flight from bonds. Obviously, a raging
bull market for stocks is drawing investors of all stripes, including the
formerly conservative types who were once bond aficionados. Bonds proved so
unpopular in 1996 that well-respected stock-fund managers, including
Fidelity Investments' Jeffrey Vinik, were criticized for incorporating too
many bonds into their portfolios.</p>
<p>"It was a tough, tough year," admits Jerry Paul, who manages $3 billion
in bonds for Invesco Trust. "Interest rates went up, and you didn't earn
your coupon, although it wasn't as bad as '94, when everything was
down."</p>
<p>The average corporate-bond fund recorded a total return of under 4% as
of Dec. 26, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Funds focusing on
bonds with top credit ratings netted under 3%. Long-term Treasury-bond
funds yielded a paltry 0.77% in total returns, which include price changes
as well as reinvested dividends, while short-term Treasury funds returned
just under 4%.</p>
<p>Funds that took on more credit risk led the pack in 1996, with the
average high-yield, or "junk" bond fund sporting a return of more than 13%,
according to Lipper. The impressive returns led to consistently strong
purchases by investors, which helped lead the junk-bond market still
higher. Further, over $30 billion of bonds got their credit ratings boosted
due to takeover activity, while others were retired at premiums.</p>
<p>"A lot of people had anticipated defaults increasing [in 1996], but
we're ending with less than 1% defaults," says Thomas Ole Dial, who manages
$1 billion of high-yield assets for Northstar Investment Management.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Huge Emerging-Markets Returns</b></p>
<p>While junk-bond funds had an excellent year, they paled in comparison
with funds investing in the raging emerging-markets arena. Emerging-market
bond funds scored a heady 40.7% return, according to Lipper, as bonds from
Russia, Ecuador and Poland gave fund managers much to cheer about.</p>
<p>In fact, these assets were among the few that surpassed the gains in
U.S. stocks. So-called total return bond-fund managers, who have more
flexibility in which bonds to choose, got a boost from adding these bonds
to their portfolios.</p>
<p>"The returns were phenomenal relative to the broader bond world," says
an exuberant Mark Siegel, the head of emerging-markets fixed-income
investments at Putnam Investment Management. "There were positive credit
developments almost everywhere in the emerging markets as most countries
are moving in their own way toward Western economic philosophy."</p>
<p>Still, outside the few growth areas, bond investors could only watch
with dismay as their funds crawled while stock funds soared. The insipid
performance has only added ammunition to the argument of many investors
that bond funds, especially those that invest in government securities,
should be avoided.</p>
<p>In addition, many financial planners decry the high fees charged by many
funds.</p>
<p>While investors often turn to bonds to avoid the risks of stocks, funds
investing in bonds with long maturities have been quite risky themselves in
recent years. Still, some financial planners argue that shorter-term bonds
are a logical avenue for investors skittish of a stock market still near
its all-time highs. If interest rates remain stable, and steady economic
growth persists, bond funds could very well turn in a respectable
performance.</p>
<p>"It'll probably be a year of roughly earning your coupon, 6.5% on the
long bond and higher in high-yield, as interest rates remain relatively
benign and few recessionary concerns arise," Mr. Paul of Invesco says.</p>
<p>Bonds are just plain due for a good year, Mr. Dawson of Federated
Research says: "All the members of the capital markets have had their days
in the sun, so it's logical that bonds are next in the queue."</p>
<p>High-yield bond funds should continue to do well, as managers remain
relatively disciplined, unless the economy slows significantly.</p>
<p>"A stable economy is the perfect environment for securities with
additional yield, like high-yield bonds," Northstar's Mr. Dial says.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">It Pays to Comparison-Shop<br>
When Selecting an Annuity</h2>

<p><b>By E<font size="-1">LLEN</font> E. S<font size="-1">CHULTZ</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>So, how does your variable annuity stack up?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Whether you're thinking of buying a variable annuity, or already have
one in your portfolio or in a 403(b) or other retirement plan, here's a way
to size it up. (The 403(b) plans, common among teachers, frequently hold
variable annuities.)</p>
<p>Variable annuities are essentially tax-sheltered minisupermarkets of
mutual funds. When you put money into a variable annuity, you can allocate
it among a variety of funds, typically from a number of fund companies.</p>
<p>Sold by insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual-fund companies and
banks, variable annuities are virtually identical to nondeductible
individual retirement accounts. Earnings are tax-deferred until taken out,
when they are taxed as regular income, plus a 10% penalty on earnings if
you're under age 59 1/2 .</p>
<p>It pays to comparison-shop. Variable-annuity providers have been beefing
up the number of funds offered in their products, but they don't always
choose the funds with an eye to quality. So it's up to you to evaluate the
funds.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to compare fees. As the number of funds grow
within variable annuities, what distinguishes one product from another is
often cost.</p>
<p>In making an evaluation, look at the funds available in the annuities
you are considering. The way to put a fund's performance into context is to
compare it with the average performance for its fund type. For instance, if
the fund is a "growth" fund, compare it with the average performance for
growth funds. These are
<a class="external" href="/public/resources/documents/q-46anew.htm">listed here</a>. If you aren't sure what category the fund is in, check your
prospectus or call the annuity company. Don't look only at a single
quarter. Compare performance over five years.</p>
<p>Performance is shown after all expenses have been deducted. The returns
are "average annual" total returns, which mean that if you held the fund
for, say, five years, the return you receive would have averaged out to the
amount shown for each year, with dividends reinvested.</p>
<p>You can also compare the expenses of one variable annuity with another.
An annuity's surrender charge, for instance, is typically 7% in year one,
declining to zero over seven years or so. A few annuities have no surrender
charges, while some have stiff charges that start at 8% or more and stay
high for years. If you're not sure that you'll stay in the annuity for
years, pay close attention to the surrender charges. Annuities with high
surrender charges pay the highest commissions to brokers and insurance
agents.</p>
<p>The second expense to compare is the insurance-company expense. The
average is 1.27% annually, although most newer annuities charge 1.40% a
year. The least expensive is Vanguard, at 0.48%. This annual expense will
be applied to all your assets each year, reducing your returns. The expense
erases the advantage of the tax-deferral for a number of years, so that's
another reason to invest only for the long term.</p>
<p>Finally, compare the expenses on the individual funds within the
annuity. If you're looking at a growth fund, for instance, compare its
annual expense with the average for its category.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Administrative Fees May Hurt<br>
Returns of Closed-End Funds</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">LEJANDRO</font> B<font size="-1">ODIPO</font>-M<font size="-1">EMBA</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Once popular, closed-end funds have lost much of their allure in recent
years, overshadowed by the dazzling performance in the stock market of the
more common open-end mutual funds.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>And now a fast-multiplying thicket of annual "administrative" fees
attached to many closed-end funds threatens to keeping them down in the
dumps, some industry veterans say.</p>
<p>A closed-end fund invests in an array of stocks, bonds or both. It then
issues a fixed number of shares that trade publicly on an exchange.</p>
<p>The number of new closed-end fund offerings has been falling steadily
since 1993. Investors have been wary of such vehicles, which often trade at
a lower price than the per-share value of the portfolio, at a time when
open-end mutual funds have been benefiting from a long bull market in
stocks. There were only five initial public offerings of closed-end stock
funds in 1996.</p>
<p>Another reason for the closed-ends' malaise, analysts say, may be the
aggressiveness of Wall Street underwriters in seeking continuing streams of
annual fees from such offerings. Some fund companies and their managers
complain that the underwriting firms have sought to maximize revenue from
closed-end funds by seeking, in addition to underwriting fees, long-term
contracts to collect fees for "additional administrative services."</p>
<p>The trend effectively locks the fund companies out of potential income,
estimated to be in the millions of dollars in annual fees. The situation is
hardly an incentive for fund companies to launch a lot of new closed-end
funds.</p>
<p>"My guess is that the underwriters got greedy," says Thomas J. Herzfeld,
president of a Miami investment advisory firm bearing his name, which
specializes in closed-end funds. "In most cases, with administrative fees,
the [underwriter] is getting a pretty fat fee for the services they
provide."</p>
<p>Unlike open-end funds, closed-ends can and often do trade at a discount
from their net asset values, or NAVs. The investor thus can't cash out at
the NAV, as an open-end investor can do, but instead must rely instead on
the vagaries of the stock market to set the share price.</p>
<p>A big segment of the closed-end fund realm is made up of foreign funds.
Often, these are single-country stock funds that invest in securities
traded on exchanges of individual foreign countries. The single-country
funds typically are marketed as speculative vehicles, or as ways to
diversify portfolios.</p>
<p>Brokers who sell closed-end funds tend to lose interest in promoting
them after the initial offering period, when the underwriters collect
upfront sales commissions that often amount to 7% out of the investor's
pocket. This commission has been a perennial drag for investors, who can
dodge it by skipping the initial offering and not buying shares until after
a closed-end fund has begun trading.</p>
<p>Starting a few years ago, a number of fund companies that manage
closed-end funds began griping about the annual administrative fees
underwriters wanted to tack on. Securities experts and regulators describe
these fees as reflective of a trend: Big Wall Street brokerage firms have
increasing power to command new fees because they control so many outlets
where the securities are sold.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has looked into the issue of
closed-end administrative fees, people familiar with the matter say. But
the SEC came to the conclusion that, in most cases, the fees don't violate
any laws.</p>
<p>"There were several complaints that underwriters wanted to enter into
separate contracts with the issuing fund company to provide administrative
services for a fee," says Kathryn McGrath, a former director of the SEC
division that regulates mutual funds. "It's a difficult case to make, and
the SEC wasn't able to get any proof" that such fees amounted to a
violation, she says.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, closed-end fund managers continue to gnash their teeth
about fees paid to underwriters for ill-defined administrative services.
The administrative fees in question, usually about 0.20% to 0.25% a year,
look relatively small on a per-investor basis but can become substantial
when applied to all shares outstanding of the fund.</p>

<p>Get ready for less of the same in 1997.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Lower inflation, lower corporate earnings, and much smaller gains in
stock prices than seen in the past two years, will be the hallmarks of
1997, many stock analysts believe.</p>
<p>The only things investors will see more of, analysts agree, are
nervousness and volatility. Still, most argue there's little reason to fear
a stock-market meltdown, even though some caution investors that
corrections of 10% or more could buffet stock prices over the course of the
new year -- the bull market's seventh.</p>
<img border="0" src="/public/current/media/SB852175568324801000.gif" align="LEFT" hspace="4" alt="[[Market Boxscores]]" height="165" width="220">
<p>"We've taken the market to a level where the factors that drove it up,
like a perfect economy, need to stay in place to keep valuations where they
are," says Jim Craig, who runs the $16 billion Janus Fund. "At these
valuations, it's obvious that we're in a higher-risk environment."</p>
<p>Investors like Mr. Craig are still struggling to catch their breath
after the stock market's astonishing ascent in 1996. Little seemed able to
rattle the six-year-old bull market for long: Even a 7% plunge in two weeks
in July, attributed to corporate-earnings disappointments and fears that a
stronger economy might lead to higher interest rates, was reversed within
months. By early October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had stampeded
above 6000, and set a string of new records throughout November,
culminating in its high for the year of 6547.79, set Nov. 25.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Soaring Volume</b></p>
<p>Despite a 101-point drop on the last day of trading, the Dow gained 26%
in 1996. While lagging behind the remarkable 33.5% return posted in 1995,
that still far outstripped most analysts' original expectations of a 10%
return on stocks for 1996. Trading volume soared: The average number of
shares changing hands daily on the New York Stock Exchange alone hit a
record 412 million shares, compared with the previous record of 346.1
million in 1995.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, bears beat a steady retreat to the sidelines to
lick their wounds, professing themselves bewildered by the market's gains
and its ability to shrug off potentially devastating shocks. Among them:
rapid gains in the number of people finding new jobs and an upward surge in
average hourly earnings, which in March and again in July, triggered sharp
but short-lasting stock-market sell-offs.</p>
<p>But while the level of nervousness has increased, Wall Street's bears
remain in the minority, vastly outnumbered by bulls, such as Abby Joseph
Cohen, Goldman Sachs's equity strategist, who early in 1995 was viewed by
many as reckless for projecting that the Dow could crack 6000. For 1997,
she is calling for another "millennial" move, predicting that the Dow could
break through 7000 to 7050.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Validity of Economic Data</b></p>
<p>"The fundamentals that have given us this bull market are still in
place," Ms. Cohen argues. "Even if growth in corporate profits is a little
slower than we're expecting, the inflation backdrop should be more
supportive, so I don't see any fundamental risk, just a delay in seeing
those profits arrive."</p>
<p>The cornerstone for Ms. Cohen's optimism is that global economic growth
will be strong enough to buoy corporate earnings, particularly in the
second half of 1997. Still, she is more cautious in her predictions that
she was a year ago, calling for returns on the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index to reach only 10% to 12%, while profits reported by the
companies composing the index might climb only 7%.</p>
<p>That kind of cautious approach to stock prices has become increasingly
common among many of the market's longtime bulls. Economic data may no
longer be sending the same warnings of looming inflation and higher
interest rates that proliferated in mid-1996, rocking stock prices. But
stocks now seem to have fully priced in the existence of the so-called
Goldilocks economy -- neither too hot nor too cold, but just right.</p>
<p>"The economic backdrop hasn't changed as radically as stock prices have
since July," says Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston. "Some of the big move in stocks was due to an increase
in [price-earnings ratios]."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Sluggish Profit Growth</b></p>
<p>Several observers are calling for more sluggish growth in profits in
1997 and more disappointments as companies report earnings. The latter have
shown an ever-increasing ability to pummel not just the stock of the
company in question, but that of companies in its industry and even, in the
case of a "bellwether" stock, the market as a whole.</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody should be counting on higher returns from
stronger earnings, especially if the companies are relying on increasing
their prices to deliver those earnings," says Kevin Bannon, who manages $35
billion in assets for the Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Bannon anticipates what he calls "normal equity returns" in 1997,
which, coming hard on the heels of a 34% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in 1995
and the 22% jump in 1996, may catch investors offguard.</p>
<p>"A 10% or so gain for the market for the year means 1% or less per
month, and people aren't used to that kind of slow growth in stocks," he
adds.</p>
<p>Already, investors have been given a taste of the kind of uncertainty
and volatility that many analysts believe await them in 1997. Last month,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=orcl&amp;page=15">Oracle</a> Corp.'s failure to meet analysts' earnings expectations
by a mere penny a share buffeted not only that company's stock but also
those of many other technology companies.</p>
<p>And ruminations by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the topic
of "irrational exuberance" in financial-asset valuations, triggered fears
that the Fed might raise interest rates to prevent a Japanese-style
"bubble" from developing in stock prices. That anxiety halted the
five-week-old postelection rally in its tracks.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Cutting Stock Exposure</b></p>
<p>"I think 1997 will prove to be a year of increased volatility as people
continue to worry about valuation levels and the economy," says Gerald
Klauer, managing partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York
institutional brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Reflecting growing uncertainty about the bull market's longevity, some
high-profile strategists have already trimmed their recommended exposure to
stocks. Most recently, Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan
Stanley, urges cutting stock allocations to 56% from 74% of his recommended
portfolio, while raising cash from zero to 15%. David Shulman, chief equity
strategist at Salomon Brothers, had earlier recommended a similar move,
trimming stock exposure to 45% from 50% in favor of holding more cash, some
20% of the model portfolio.</p>
<p>Some bulls argue that continued inflows of cash into stock mutual funds
will continue to buoy prices in 1997. Given the perceived need by many
mutual-fund managers to be fully invested, this means more cash available
to plow into stocks. As of the end of 1996, the chief beneficiaries
continued to be large-cap and blue-chip stocks with substantial liquidity.
These, traders and analysts say, offer managers some comfort that should
the market take a turn for the worse they could remove their cash as
quickly as they were able to invest it. But not everyone believes that
liquidity will continue to fuel double-digit gains in the major
indexes.</p>
<p>"It takes more and more cash at this level of the Dow to push it
higher," says Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Moreover, he says, history is working against the market: Stock prices tend
to perform much more poorly the year following a presidential election, or
the year following two years of substantial outperformance. And while many
of his peers can't find any kind of trigger for a stock-market correction
in either the economic outlook or stock fundamentals, Mr. McCable isn't as
optimistic.</p>
<p>"Some important corrections had no important economic catalyst," he
says. "The risks of a market-corrective phase ... appear to be growing in
1997."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Sectors Posting the Best Results<br>
May Again Dominate in 1997</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REG</font> I<font size="-1">P</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>That the stock market almost matched its spectacular 1995 gain in 1996
is impressive enough. What is really striking is that many of the same
sectors led the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Energy, banks and semiconductors -- three of 1995's best performers --
turned in shining performances again in 1996. And few analysts are ready to
bet against them in 1997. There also were similarities on the list of
losers: trucking, steel and factory equipment.</p>
<p>"The common element between the [winners] is the economics of the
business" took a turn for the better in 1996, says Joseph Battipaglia,
chief investment strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co. The common element among
the losers was a lack of pricing power, he says.</p>
<p>"In those companies there's less that distinguishes one product from the
other. In an environment that has little pricing power, the only way you
can compete is on lower prices, which is disastrous for your profit
margins."</p>
<p>But 1996 wasn't all an encore. Footwear companies and securities brokers
joined the winners, while looming deregulation condemned electrical and
telephone utilities' long-suffering shareholders to a year of subpar
performance.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Technology</b></p>
<p>The stalwarts of technology -- semiconductors, computers and software --
were among the best-performing sectors in 1996, but it was the
stock-pickers who profited.</p>
<p>Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, says, "In those groups it wasn't so much breadth of strength, but
that they contained within themselves some of the more spectacular
companies."</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=intc&amp;page=15">Intel</a> Corp. more than doubled,
pacing a 79% gain in the semiconductor index.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=msft&amp;page=15">Microsoft</a> Corp. climbed 88%, helping
software rise 36%.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ibm&amp;page=15">International Business
Machines</a> Corp. was one of the most impressive component of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, rising 66% to $151.50 from $91.375 at the
beginning of the year; it also pushed the computer index up 41%. Other big
movers were network-equipment maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=csco&amp;page=15">Cisco Systems</a> Inc., up 71% to
$63.63, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq
Computer</a> Corp., up 55%.</p>
<p>All rode soaring demand for technology from businesses more obsessed
than ever with increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Lary Aasheim, technology analyst at CoreStates Investment Advisers, said
personal-computer sales beat expectations with a rise of 20% in 1996, not
far off 1995's 26% increase. PC makers benefited from an 80% plunge in the
price of dynamic random access memory chips.</p>
<p>"That benefits large portions of the tech area, except the DRAM makers,"
says Mr. Aasheim. "They have to foot the bill to everyone's benefit." He
says an 80% drop in DRAM prices cuts the cost of a computer 16%, part of
which manufacturers pocketed.</p>
<p>Other companies joining the technology boom were hard-disk makers such
as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wdc&amp;page=15">Western
Digital</a> Corp., up more than threefold; computer-printer maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=encd&amp;page=15">Encad</a> Inc., whose stock more than tripled on the Nasdaq Stock
Market; and a trio of Nasdaq-listed companies that are connected to helping
computers record the year 2000:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tsri&amp;page=15">TSR</a> Inc.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=zitl&amp;page=15">Zitel</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=vias&amp;page=15">Viasoft</a> Inc.</p>
<p>Can technology repeat this performance in 1997? Many analysts say
yes.</p>
<p>James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer at State Street Research
&amp; Management, says: "More than 50% of capital spending is now
technology related. Our economy has been very aggressive in building
productivity and that leads to very active investment in technology. There
will be catch-up spending coming out of Europe."</p>
<p>Mr. Aasheim says more DRAM capacity remains to come on stream,
suggesting memory will remain cheap, boosting sales and profits of PC
makers and their suppliers, like Intel. For the same reason he advises
avoiding suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment like
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lrcx&amp;page=15">LAM Research</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=amat&amp;page=15">Applied Materials</a> Inc.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Energy</b></p>
<p>Colder weather, Middle East tensions and rising demand in the developing
world produced an inexorable -- and surprising -- rise in the price of oil,
to a five-year high in 1996.</p>
<p>It made oil drilling the single-best performing sector of the stock
market, rising more than twofold. Among the group's top performers were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=flcn&amp;page=15">Falcon Drilling</a> Co.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rdc&amp;page=15">Rowan</a> Cos. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=glm&amp;page=15">Global Marine</a> Inc., all more than doubling on the
New York Stock Exchange;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cldr&amp;page=15">Cliffs Drilling</a>
Co. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mdco&amp;page=15">Marine
Drilling</a> Co. both rose about fourfold on Nasdaq; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=uti&amp;page=15">UTI Energy</a> Corp., was up sixfold on the American
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Among oil companies, the closer they were to the black, sticky stuff,
the better. Among the exploration companies to benefit most from the rise
in crude prices were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=umc&amp;page=15">United Meridian</a>
Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=chk&amp;page=15">Chesapeake
Energy</a> Corp., with more-than-twofold increases on the Big Board;
Williams Energy Inc., up fivefold on Nasdaq; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sab&amp;page=15">Saba Petroleum</a> Co., up sixfold, and
TransMontaigne Oil Co., up threefold on Amex.</p>
<p>Tim Straus, manager of equity research sales at Jefferies &amp; Co.,
says rapid economic growth in the developing world means demand for oil
"still looks very robust for many years." As for the suppliers of
oil-drilling and oil-field services, "The capital-spending budgets of major
integrated energy companies are put in place at the end of the year and
unless something serious happens to energy prices, that money is going to
be spent."</p>
<p>However, integrated oils weren't great beneficiaries of this demand,
because their refining, marketing and petrochemical divisions were burdened
by intense competition and excess capacity, says Mr. Weiss.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tx&amp;page=15">Texaco</a> rose 25%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> 22%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Banks</b></p>
<p>The 45% gain registered by money-center banks in 1996 was remarkable
enough, but even more so on top of their 57% gain in 1995. Many of their
shareholders have more than doubled their money in the past two years, not
bad considering that bad loans that crippled some banks in the early
1990s.</p>
<p>The gain also is remarkable in that it came without help from interest
rates, which ended the year about where they began in 1996. Bank stocks
generally benefit when rates fall.</p>
<p>Bank stocks "have never been just an interest-rate story in the 1990s,"
says Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. "If
you look at the strength of balance sheets, loan losses, dividend growth,
earnings growth, this is the best set of fundamentals for three
decades."</p>
<p>Citicorp soared 53%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bac&amp;page=15">BankAmerica</a> Corp.
rose 54% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cmb&amp;page=15">Chase Manhattan</a>
Corp.--actually, the merged Chase and Chemical Banking Corp.--increased
52%.</p>
<p>Major regional banks were also big winners.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nb&amp;page=15">NationsBank</a> Corp. rose 40%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ftu&amp;page=15">First Union</a> Corp. increased 33% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wfc&amp;page=15">Wells Fargo</a> &amp; Co. gained 25%.</p>
<p>Mr. Applegate remains positive on bank stocks, saying that relative to
expected earnings they still trade at 10% to 15% less than the market
average.</p>
<p>"The worry about the banks is people are always waiting for them to find
the next bad customer. They did in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was
less-developed countries and real estate. Now they're not playing a market
share game, but a profitability game."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, brokerage firms rode the stock market to a boom of their own.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co. rose 60%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sch&amp;page=15">Charles Schwab</a> Corp., 59%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bsc&amp;page=15">Bear Stearns</a> Cos., 47%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Footwear</b></p>
<p>One of the year's more remarkable stories was the strong showing of
footwear, which was only an average performer in 1995. The sector was up
62%, paced by
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nke&amp;page=15">Nike</a> Inc., whose
shares rose 72% as a strong brand name delivered impressive sales growth at
home and abroad.</p>
<p>But the sector was also home to some turnarounds. Sneaker-maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cve&amp;page=15">Converse</a> Inc. was one of the year's great comeback
stories, restructuring, returning to an operating profit and as a result
seeing its shares quadruple.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Business &amp; Consumer Cyclicals</b></p>
<p>The flip side of big capital spending going into silicon and software
was that less of it was left for steel, bricks and heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Steelmakers had another depressing year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bs&amp;page=15">Bethlehem Steel</a> Corp. lost 36% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=x&amp;page=15">USX-U.S. Steel</a> Group eked out a 2%
gain. Heavy construction, factory equipment and industrial technology were
three of the year's worst-performing sectors, each down about 4% to 6%.</p>
<p>Such cyclical companies suffered from the slow steady growth in the
economy, which few forecasters expect to change markedly.</p>
<p>The same concerns bedeviled consumer cyclicals, particularly home
builders, whose stocks were down 4% over the year.</p>
<p>DLJ's Mr. Miller says those stocks are unlikely to perform well until
the economy is into its next recession "whenever that is, and when the Fed
reverses gears and starts to ease. That might be the end of 1997."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Telecommunications and Broadcast</b></p>
<p>Cable and telephone companies, stock-market darlings in 1995, got a cold
shower of competition and deregulation in 1996.</p>
<p>Cable stocks were hardest hit.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tcoma&amp;page=15">Tele-Communications</a> Inc.
plunged 28%, while
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cvc&amp;page=15">Cablevision
Systems</a> Corp. tumbled 44%. Phone companies fared little better.
After beating the market with a 41% gain in 1995, they lagged far behind in
1996, ending little changed on the year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> fell 6% during the year,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bel&amp;page=15">Bell Atlantic</a> Corp. slid 3%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sbc&amp;page=15">SBC Communications</a> Inc. dropped 9% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nyn&amp;page=15">Nynex</a> lost 11%.</p>
<p>Deregulation has also preyed on electrical utilities, leaving their
shares down 5% on the year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=so&amp;page=15">Southern</a> Co. slid
8%, as well as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pcg&amp;page=15">Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric</a> Co. dropped 26%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pe&amp;page=15">Peco Energy</a> Co. fell 16%.</p>
<p>But telephone and electricity stocks could reward investors in 1997
simply because they are one of the last havens of value, says Paul Lesutis,
managing director of Brandywine Asset Management.</p>

Mark Top Stories in 1996</h2>

<p><b>By W<font size="-1">ILLIAM</font> P<font size="-1">OWER</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>In 1996, the stock market soared -- well, at least it did on days that
the latest employment data weren't released or Alan Greenspan didn't
sneeze. But as usual, there were also plenty of light-hearted moments on
the investing scene, dutifully tracked by The Wall Street Journal. Some
highlights:</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>When Is A Mutual Fund Like a Football Player?</b></p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>It was a sorry year for pro football's New York Jets -- a 1-15 record
made them the butt of jokes. That may be why big defensive end Marvin
Washington looked long and hard for a fresh way to describe his team's
woes, and wound up sounding like Peter Lynch.</p>
<p>"You have to look at it like the stock market and being in it for the
long haul -- like a mutual fund," Mr. Washington opined to New York
sportswriters one day in November. "Like, in the end, it's going to work
out for you. Hopefully that's what my career is going to be. I'm a mutual
fund and at the end it's going to work out."</p>
<p>If not, Mr. Washington might have a broker career.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Not as Bad as Novartis, But Still ...</b></p>
<p>Most Needless Renaming Award on Wall Street for '96 has to go to the
Public Securities Association. After years of going merrily along with its
name, PSA for short, the bond-market trade group decided that wasn't good
enough. It sent out an imposing "Notice to the Press" announcing the grand
new name:</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association. No dash, hyphen or anything. And
awkward as it may seem, that's where the "the" is supposed to be, according
to the trade group. It says it changed its name to make clear that it
includes more than just "public" securities.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Crystal Ball I: Garzarelli on A Roll</b></p>
<p>Market guru Elaine Garzarelli was the subject of a lot of hype after the
1987 stock-market crash. She turned bearish before it happened -- though
whether she actually "predicted the crash" is still a matter of debate on
Wall Street. That didn't stop her from mailing out one of the most alarming
pieces of junk mail in Street history in November.</p>
<p>"SELL NOW!" the envelope warned in red. "Get OUT of all U.S. stocks and
mutual funds now." The mailing noted that the warnings came from a guru who
had "predicted every bear market crash of the last 20 years."</p>
<p>There has been only one crash in that time, but let's not get picky. If
the market crashes any time in the next 20 years, the guru, or at least her
public-relations people, can say she was right again.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b><b>Crystal Ball II: Standard, but Not So
Poor</b></b></p>
<p>We saved the annual market prediction from Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook
newsletter that arrived a year ago. It's often a bit nasty to wait a year
and see how wrong the experts were.</p>
<p>This year, the newsletter's Arnold Kaufman spoiled the fun, to a
point.</p>
<p>A year ago Dec. 20, he wrote that while the stock market "is bound to
become far more volatile, major averages will post at least modest gains in
1996." Exactly right on point one, though much too conservative on point
two. He predicted the S&amp;P 500 would end the year up just 5% or so. It
finished four times higher than that.</p>
<p>This is the second straight year that Mr. Kaufman was right, but far too
conservative, about the market's direction.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Kaufman now: "Just about every 20 years, the market has
outstanding back-to-back gains," and the size of the gains caught him and
many others by surprise. "Unfortunately, such patterns don't bode well for
1997," he adds. He's looking for a 4% gain in 1997.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Don't Watch This With Breakfast</b></p>
<p>OK, OK. It was a decent movie, but the puns and clever variations can
stop now.</p>
<p>The last straw came in 1996, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange put
out a video on livestock-futures trading and announced in its advertisement
(get ready): "Cows, Pigs and Videotape."</p>
<p>Please, make them stop!</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Fedspeak: When a Crash Isn't a Crash</b></p>
<p>Stock markets went into a tizzy in December after a speech by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan included a reference to "irrational exuberance" in
markets.</p>
<p>Less-noticed in the speech was that Mr. Greenspan referred to the 1987
stock-market crash as "the sharp stock-market break of 1987."</p>
<p>Really, should investors hang on the every word of someone who, like
other Wall Street institutions, has shied away from calling a crash a
crash?</p>
<p>From now on, it's the 508-point, 22.61% little hiccup.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Whooshful Thinking?</b></p>
<p>After Monarchy/Regency Enterprises, an independent film company,
purchased a 12.5% stake in Puma, the athletic-shoe maker, for $75 million,
the founding chairman of Monarchy/Regency waxed poetic.</p>
<p>Said Arnon Milchan, producer of such films as "Pretty Woman" and "A Time
to Kill": "I hope to transform Puma into the Julia Roberts of the
athletic-footwear industry. I believe Puma is my new 'Pretty Woman.' " What
does that make Nike and Reebok?</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>They Don't Sell Raptors, Either</b></p>
<p>With the spectacular collapse of British bank Barings PLC still fresh on
everyone's minds, a much-smaller Cleveland company with the same-sounding
name suddenly changed its name.</p>
<p>Thus,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ber&amp;page=15">Bearings</a>
Inc. -- that's Bearings in print -- announced over the summer that it was
becoming Applied Industrial Technologies Inc. No longer will investors
think their brokers have lost their minds and are saying, "Buy stock in
Barings!"</p>
<p>Was the Cleveland company just sick of Barings jokes? No, says
spokeswoman Darlene Scarpaci. Bearings, she says, just wants to emphasize
that it's involved in much more than just bearings now -- a whole range of
"replacement components" for industry.</p>
<p>Not that the company is immune from wisecracks. It also changed its
colors from red and black to what Ms. Scarpaci calls "a real lovely purple
and teal." The result: "We did get some Barney jokes," admits Ms.
Scarpaci.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Other Than That, Morale Is Sky-High</b></p>
<p>How difficult is it to merge two financial firms from different
countries?</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell continues to find out, years after the German
firm (Deutsche Bank) bought the British one (Morgan Grenfell).</p>
<p>London traders last year marveled about the meeting that Michael Dobson,
group chief executive of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, had with executives, in
which, according to people at the meeting, one British unit head at the
German-Anglo firm said, "As I see it, Morgan Grenfell has all the brains
and Deutsche Bank has all the dumbbells. What is Morgan Grenfell doing to
ensure that the skill pool isn't diluted?"</p>
<p>A Deutsche Morgan Grenfell spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>By the way, Peter Young, the Morgan Grenfell fund manager who became the
center of a mutual-fund scandal that cost Deutsche Bank several hundred
million dollars and was fired in September, is English. Oh, well.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Wall Street's Priorities: An Update</b></p>
<p>No, Wall Streeters aren't all money-grubbers. Really. And here is the
proof -- not.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq Computer</a> Corp. ran a
publicity gimmick in December outside the New York Stock Exchange: It set
up a bank of Presario 3020 PCs and asked 500 traders and others to type in
their "wish list" for Christmas. The top-three wishes:</p>
<p>1. $1 million</p>
<p>2. A new car</p>
<p>3. A home computer</p>
<p>Great. What about, uh, world peace? That made No. 4, at least, followed
by "a vacation."</p>
<p>Among the also-ran picks were "a baby girl," contact lenses, Tickle Me
Elmo, Wonderbra, tuba lessons and "Dow 8000 in '97."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most realistic answer the computers registered: "My job
back."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>This Just In</b></p>
<p>The annual Securities Industry Association poll of what investors think
about Wall Street came up with a predictable result: About half the
investing public continues to see "greed and self-interest" as big problems
in the brokerage industry. Gordon Gekko wouldn't have minded.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Investors' IPO Fever Cooled<br>
With the Summer Correction</h2>

<p><b>By D<font size="-1">EBORAH</font> L<font size="-1">OHSE</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>For initial public offerings, 1996 held the good, the bad and the
ugly.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investors and analysts will remember 1996 as a microcosm of almost every
possible IPO environment. First there was the spring's reckless buying
frenzy. Investors snapped up shares of virtually any small, speculative
company -- especially those with the word "Internet" in their prospectus --
without regard to the price they were paying for companies that might not
turn a profit for years. In those heady days, IPOs routinely ran up 50% or
more in their first day of post-IPO trading.</p>
<p>Then came the summer's brutal IPO correction that brought many freshly
minted stocks down 30% or more, even as the overall market declined much
less than that. It was followed by the second half of 1996's sobering
retreat, when investors rediscovered the notion of stock valuation, and
began imposing tough-minded pricing on underwriters.</p>
<p>Even with that new conservatism, however, the IPO calendar continued to
spit out new companies at a record-setting pace.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Record Deals, But Not Returns</b></p>
<p>The year will also be remembered for completion of the largest single
deal ever,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a>
Corp.'s spinoff of its telecommunications equipment unit
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> Inc., brought public by
underwriters led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. It was also the year of the
largest foreign IPO, by some estimates, as <a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt &amp;page=15">Deutsche Telekom</a> AG, the German telecommunications company, was
brought public by underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>But while 1996 was a record year in many respects, investors didn't wind
up with record returns. Despite raising $46 billion from 692 new offerings
-- the most ever -- the IPO Class of 1996 wound up turning in below-market
returns of 12.1% on average. That was a far cry from 1995's record-setting
33.9% average return on IPOs, and below 1996's 26% increase in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>To be sure, some of the performance lag resulted from investors' move to
safe, liquid blue chips after the summer, putting further price and
performance pressure on IPOs. And many IPOs were priced so steeply in the
spring that they just couldn't churn out positive returns after their
sell-off.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, analysts say that assuming the broader market stays
intact, they expect the IPO market in 1997 to resemble the more-sober
second half of 1996. They expect investors to continue to keep the pricing
reins well in hand, rejecting speculative issues as they recall 1996 deals
that burned out.</p>
<p>"People are not going to invest in companies that don't have substantive
earnings," says Thomas Weisel, chairman of Montgomery Securities.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Quest for the Next Hot Deal</b></p>
<p>That wasn't always the case in 1996. February through June, especially,
resembled a sort of drunken investors convention. Money managers ignored
the high prices they were paying for new companies in a single-minded quest
for the next hot deal. It was hard to fault them. They were flush with cash
from baby boomers using their 401(k) plans to shovel money into scores of
aggressive-growth funds and the newest crop of microcap funds, both of
which are among the biggest buyers of IPOs.</p>
<p>For a while, they were rewarded handsomely. In the heat of the frenzy
around May and early June, virtually every deal was priced higher than its
originally targeted price. Deals ran up an average of 28% just in May.</p>
<p>"The first five months, it was a delight," says Robert Cooney, head of
the syndicate desk at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. "You marked
everything up and it went up even more" in post-IPO trading.</p>
<p>Most of the market's hottest one-day deals priced in this frothy mix.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xyln&amp;page=15">Xylan</a> Corp., a network-switching company went public in March at
$26 and immediately doubled, ending the day at $58.375.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=yhoo&amp;page=15">Yahoo!</a> Inc., the Internet directory and search
company, went public in April at $13 and quickly shot into the low 30s,
despite having limited revenue and an uncertain path to profitability.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Diamonds in the Rough'</b></p>
<p>Even the most speculative issues found willing buyers. There were stocks
like
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=aksy&amp;page=15">Aksys</a>
Ltd., a provider of products and services for patients with chronic kidney
failure. Although it hadn't yet reported any revenue, the company was
priced above its targeted range, at $16, in May, and closed at $20.50 on
its first day of trading. (It now trades around $8.)</p>
<p>Stocks like these "could be diamonds in the rough, but they were being
priced like a diamond at Tiffany's," says Linda Killian, portfolio manager
at Renaissance Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p>IPOs suffered a reversal after investors began having doubts about
technology stocks in June, on the heels of lackluster earnings outlooks
from such bellwether stocks as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mot&amp;page=15">Motorola</a> Inc. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=hwp&amp;page=15">Hewlett-Packard</a> Co. The Nasdaq Stock Market, laden
with tech stocks, ultimately fell some 20%, peak to trough.</p>
<p>As a result, IPOs that likely would have soared only weeks before --
such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ozemy&amp;page=15">OzEmail</a>
Ltd., which provides Internet access in Australia and New Zealand, and
Internet search engine
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=seek&amp;page=15">Infoseek</a> Corp.
-- priced below their ranges and faltered in early trading. OzEmail priced
at $14 and quickly faltered, trading recently at $9.625. Infoseek priced at
$12 on June 11, recently traded at $8.50.</p>
<p>Before long, underwriters were delaying deals in the hope that the
small-cap market, as well as the IPO environment, would rev back up
again.</p>
<p>The market did reverse course, but by then investors had started paying
attention to how much they were paying for companies with little to show
for themselves. As a result, in the second half of the year, a greater
percentage of deals were priced within or below their originally targeted
range, a concept unimaginable only months before.</p>
<p>The new pricing ethic seemed to work. The deals priced in the second
half have turned in 15.6% gains by year end,  according to Securities Data
Co., while those priced in the first half returned only 11.6% when all was
said and done for 1996.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Sectors</b></p>
<p>Business software, mortgage finance and telecommunications service were
generally among the strongest sectors in 1996 and some analysts expect
business-software companies to continue to be a strong sector for 1997. Mr.
Weisel of Montgomery Securities also believes that the biotech IPO market
may open up, with 100 new drugs possibly being approved this year.
Montgomery expects the biotech market to go to $25 billion from $5 billion
in two years.</p>
<p>Other industries that were up fairly strongly in 1996 and could be good
candidates for 1997, Mr. Weisel notes, are semiconductor capital-equipment
issues, consumer, education, employment services, specialty lenders and
specialty retailers, application software, and finance companies. Robert
Natale, vice president of equity research at Standard &amp; Poor's, expects
biotechs, health-care technology and restaurant stocks to succeed this
year. "Those are the few industries that have valuations that are
reasonable from a historical perspective," says Mr. Natale.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Merger Records Shatter as Firms<br>
Capitalize on Favorable Climate</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>It was a year for the history books.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Merger-and-acquisition activity in 1996 smashed records set domestically
and internationally in 1995 as companies nourished their hunger for growth
spurred through takeovers. Megamergers in the telecommunications and
defense industries helped balloon the totals to unprecedented amounts.</p>
<p>In the U.S., $659 billion in mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs were
announced, up 27% from $519 billion in 1995, according to Securities Data
Co., a Newark, N.J., research company. Globally, a stunning $1.14 trillion
of deals were announced, thanks in part to the second-biggest merger ever
-- the union of Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, two Swiss pharmaceutical
giants, valued in excess of $30 billion. The global total was up slightly
from the prior record, in 1995, of $950 billion.</p>
<div class="inset"><hr><p>See a list of the
<a class="article" href="/public/current/articles/SB852156998823463500.htm">50 largest deals</a> of 1996.</p>
<hr></div>
<p>The climate was as good as it gets. Looser regulation is changing the
competitive landscapes in telecommunications, utilities and broadcast,
among other industries. The "Goldilocks" economy -- not too hot and not too
cold -- helped quicken "M&amp;A" activity by encouraging companies to find
ways to boost earnings growth.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Year Expected</b></p>
<p>Because these conditions aren't expected to change, 1997 is shaping up
to be another strong year, M&amp;A experts say.</p>
<p>"As long as the markets are favorable, I would think the underlying
imperatives will continue," says Felix Rohatyn, managing director at Lazard
Freres &amp; Co. and one of Wall Street's senior dealmakers. "The thing to
watch out for is the markets getting less buoyant, or the regulatory
climate reversing itself." In the meantime, he adds, "we've had a year
that's hard to believe."</p>
<p>Indeed, with double-digit returns for the past two years, the stock
market rewarded many companies with rich share prices with which to acquire
targets. "So much of this cycle has been driven by supportive equity
markets," says Bruce Fiedorek, head of mergers at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
"Different sectors may wax and wane, but many of the factors driving
activity are still present."</p>
<p>Given such favorable conditions, companies are stepping up to the plate
for surprisingly big "dream deals" that offer the potential for market
dominance, once believed to be unthinkable. "CEO confidence is high," says
Jack Levy, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "More and more
CEOs and boards are prepared to undertake a checkmate transaction, which
can radically transform their competitive position."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Eagerness for Stock Deals</b></p>
<p>One attribute that set 1996 apart is that "there were so many large
transactions," says Frederic Escherich, managing director at J.P. Morgan
&amp; Co. Because buyers and sellers both were eager to do tax-free stock
mergers rather than cash deals, such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ba&amp;page=15">Boeing</a> Co.'s $14 billion
purchase of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=md&amp;page=15">McDonnell
Douglas</a> Corp., "the willingness of the stock market to take stock
in big quantities has made it much easier to do transactions," Mr.
Escherich says.</p>
<p>And the stock market rewards deals perceived as sound:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=g&amp;page=15">Gillette</a> Co.'s $7.3 billion acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dur&amp;page=15">Duracell International</a> Inc. rose in value to nearly $8
billion because of the rise in Gillette's stock, the currency used to pay
Duracell shareholders.</p>
<p>Deregulation and the increased competition for phone service spawned
some of the biggest-ever U.S. mergers, such as the $21.3 billion
combination of local phone giants
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bel&amp;page=15">Bell Atlantic</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nyn&amp;page=15">Nynex</a> Corp., a transaction creating a behemoth in the
Eastern U.S.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sbc&amp;page=15">SBC Communications</a> Inc. became
the Western giant with its $16.5 billion pact to acquire
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pac&amp;page=15">Pacific Telesis Group</a>, the San Francisco Baby Bell.
By the end of the summer,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wcom&amp;page=15">WorldCom</a> Inc.,
the fast-growing long-distance provider, agreed to link up with
business-phone operator
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mfst&amp;page=15">MFS
Communications</a> Co. for $13.4 billion. Then
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bty&amp;page=15">British Telecommunications</a> PLC stunned
both sides of the Atlantic by announcing its $21.3 billion acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mcic&amp;page=15">MCI Communications</a> Corp.</p>
<p>"While [1995] was characterized by media and entertainment megadeals,
[the 1996] M&amp;A market has been distinguished by huge telecom deals as
consolidation accelerated in the wake of last year's telecom legislation,"
says John Finley, a partner at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.</p>
<p>While most industries saw a pickup in merger activity, other strong
sectors include defense and energy. The year started with
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a> Corp.'s $8.8 billion acquisition of
most of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lor&amp;page=15">Loral</a>
Corp. and ended with the Boeing-McDonnell transaction. Companies that had
defense businesses, but not enough critical mass to survive in a shrinking
industry, are shedding their defense holdings. Two examples were the $3
billion sale of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wx&amp;page=15">Westinghouse
Electric</a> Corp.'s defense unit to
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=noc&amp;page=15">Northrop Grumman</a> Corp., and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rok&amp;page=15">Rockwell International</a>'s $3.2 billion sale of its defense arm to
Boeing.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Energy Hot Spots</b></p>
<p>Besides defense, the energy industries -- ranging from utilities to
pipeline companies to major oil giants and off-shore drillers -- were hot
spots. In addition to a spate of intraindustry transactions, utilities
began acquiring oil and gas-pipeline companies as the two industries
"converge"' into an emerging power industry.</p>
<p>So
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=duk&amp;page=15">Duke
Power</a> Co. agreed to acquire pipeline giant PanEnergy Corp. for
$7.7 billion, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=hou&amp;page=15">Houston
Industries</a> Inc. announced a $2.4 billion pact to buy
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nae&amp;page=15">NorAm Energy</a> Corp. A pipeline company turned
broad-based energy company,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ene&amp;page=15">Enron</a> Corp. agreed
to purchase for $2.1 billion Portland General Corp., a low-cost
utility.</p>
<p>Banking consolidation slowed in 1996 after an unprecedented year in
1995. But the thrift industry saw a flurry of deals, such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wamu&amp;page=15">Washington Mutual</a> Inc.'s $1.6 billion purchase of
American Savings Bank and First Nationwide Holdings Inc.'s acquisition of
Cal Fed Bancorp Inc. for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Less Successful Hostile Bids</b></p>
<p>Hostile takeover bids slowed, in part because it's tough to pay high
prices for takeovers when the stock market is so lofty.</p>
<p>In 1996, companies such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wcs&amp;page=15">Wallace Computer Services</a> Inc.
and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tec&amp;page=15">Commercial
Intertech</a> Corp. successfully spurned bids. Numerous "bear hugs"
such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mat&amp;page=15">Mattel</a>
Inc.'s $5.2 billion bid for
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=has&amp;page=15">Hasbro</a> Inc. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=klu&amp;page=15">Kaiser Aluminum</a> Corp.'s bid for
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=amx&amp;page=15">Alumax</a> Inc., were fought off by
recalcitrant targets.</p>
<p>While the deals of 1996 were mostly corporations acquiring other
companies or divisions, leveraged buyouts also picked up. Financial buyers
acquired at least $22 billion in companies in 1996, the busiest year since
1989, according to J.P. Morgan. Still, buyouts accounted for only about 5%
of deals, excluding spinoffs, compared with about 33% in 1988, according to
J.P. Morgan.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bigger Firms and Fatter Assets<br>
Dominate Money Management</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>For money managers, it's hard to dislike a year in which the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 26%.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Managers are paid a fee that is a percentage of the assets managed --
usually 0.5% to 1% for stock portfolios and somewhat less for bonds. When a
bull market fattens the asset total, clients are happy and the fees roll
in.</p>
<p>In 1996, three trends dominated the money-management arena. One was the
emergence of huge firms. Another was a resurgence in the popularity of
indexing, an investment technique that seeks only to match the market, not
to beat it. A third was the increasing importance of mutual funds.</p>
<p>The trend toward Goliath-sized firms was accelerated by mergers and
acquisitions, many of them across international borders. On the last day of
1995, the money-management arm of London banking giant Barclays PLC
acquired the largest U.S. money manager, Wells Fargo Nikko Investment
Advisers. During 1996, the pieces were reorganized into a single firm,
Barclays Global Investors, with headquarters in San Francisco and assets
(as of Sept. 30) of $371 billion.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Merger Action</b></p>
<p>In the summer, Chancellor Asset Management of New York was acquired by
LGT Asset Management of Liechtenstein. And Invesco PLC of Britain is
merging with AIM Management Group of Houston.</p>
<p>The domestic front also saw plenty of merger action. Merrill Lynch
snatched up Hotchkis &amp; Wiley of Los Angeles. New England Investment
Cos. paid $110 million for Jurika &amp; Voyles in San Francisco. And
Franklin Resources is in the process of swallowing Heine Securities, which
runs the popular Mutual Series funds.</p>
<p>Are the days of the small money manager numbered? Many people think so.
"The amount of capital needed to market your products is so large" that
it's hard for the little guys of the business to compete, says Jim Floyd of
Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>"If you're an individual investor and you're searching for a [mutual]
fund, you go with names that you know, just as when you're buying a stereo
or computer," says Scott Lummer of Ibbotson Associates in Chicago.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone believes that bigger is better. "The perverse
thing is that some firms build for the sake of building," says Tom Monroe,
director of equity research at Frank Russell Co., an investment-consulting
firm in Tacoma, Wash. "There's a lot of talk about mega-managers, global
presence, and one-stop shopping. Our clients are not saying they want to
shop for all their money management in one place."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Growth in Number of Managers</b></p>
<p>According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the total number of
money managers is still growing, but slowly. There are currently 22,400
registered investment advisers, up from about 22,000 in 1995. That's 2%
growth, the same as in 1995. By contrast, the number of advisers grew 8% in
1994 and 11% in 1993.</p>
<p>In addition to registered advisers, there are private investment pools
called hedge funds. Most take a high-risk, high-return approach, and their
managers typically are compensated with 20% of the investment profits.
Michael Stolper, a San Diego investment consultant, estimates that there
are close to 4,000 hedge funds in the U.S., and says they are pulling away
some of the brightest young talent from traditional firms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the battle continues between active managers, who try to pick
the best stocks and bonds, and passive managers, who try to emulate an
index, such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Active vs. Passive Management</b></p>
<p>A layperson would assume that active management is superior. But it's
far from clear. Passive managers have lower costs for research and trading,
and can pass the savings on to clients. And lately, it has been very hard
for active managers to beat the indexes. One reason: Large stocks, such as
those that make up the S&amp;P index, have generally outperformed small
stocks.</p>
<p>As a result, money flowed into indexed investments in 1996. According to
Greenwich Associates, corporate pension plans now have about 28% of their
stock portfolios in a passive mode, compared with about 25.3% a year
earlier.</p>
<p>For most managers, the success of indexing is more than an
embarrassment, it is a threat to profits. Index funds undermine the
prevailing fee structure because they charge less than half of what active
managers charge.</p>
<p>Another major trend is the growth of mutual funds, which have taken the
public by storm and continue to pile up assets. Despite some faltering
during the last quarter of the year, stock funds experienced record inflows
during 1996, eclipsing the record set in 1993. As of Nov. 30, mutual funds
controlled assets of $3.5 trillion, more than five times the total of a
decade ago.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Getting into Mutual Funds</b></p>
<p>The mutual-fund total is now roughly the same as that for corporate
pension plans, which once dwarfed mutual funds in size. As a result,
money-management organizations that for years served only pension funds,
endowments and foundations are suddenly sprouting mutual-fund arms, or
acquiring mutual-fund companies.</p>
<p>The biggest player on the mutual-fund scene is Fidelity Investments,
based in Boston. For Fidelity, 1996 brought more than its share of
turmoil.</p>
<p>Jeff Vinik, manager of Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund, the largest
mutual fund in the country, decided -- wrongly in retrospect -- to lighten
up on stocks because he saw the market as overvalued. Earlier, he had
incurred criticism for selling some stocks around the time he was praising
them in media interviews. In May, Mr. Vinik announced that he was leaving
Fidelity to run his own money-management firm. A few other well-known
managers have also left, and in November, Fidelity experienced $1 billion
in outflow as investors withdrew funds.</p>
<p>By all reports, Mr. Vinik is doing fine in raising money for his new
firm. But many people saw his departure as a sign that it can be hazardous
to one's career to be less than fully invested during a rampaging bull
market.</p>
<p>"When I got into this business, I had to persuade people to buy and
hold," says Steven L. Eber, head of Eber Capital Management in Coral
Gables, Fla. "Now there is such unanimity by the public: Buy the dips, buy
and hold."</p>
<p>Believing that stock prices are too high, Mr. Eber is now only about 40%
invested in stocks. But he says he can do so only because he runs his own
firm. "It's heresy," he says. "Guys three years into the business can't
afford that luxury."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Treasurys' Wide Price Swings<br>
Didn't Help Mediocre Returns</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REGORY</font> Z<font size="-1">UCKERMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>When the Federal Reserve Board cut the federal-funds rate by a quarter
point last Jan. 31, bond traders girded themselves for a volatile year --
full of wide price moves and significant central bank interest-rate
adjustments. As it turns out, they got the former, not the latter.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>In fact, the January cut would be the only move made by the Fed during
the entire year, frustrating Wall Street's soothsayers, many of whom first
predicted rate cuts, then increases.</p>
<p>Despite the inaction, bond prices were anything but stable, with yields
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond starting the year at 5.95%, and
moving as high as 7.2% in July before finishing the year at 6.64%.</p>
<p>In all, 1996 will go down as a fairly disappointing year for bond
investors. The Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index, a benchmark used by
most investment managers, scored an insipid 4.16% total return, as of Dec.
30, down from 1995's stellar 18.47% performance.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>High Volume for Corporate Issuance</b></p>
<p>"Unlike our friends in the equity markets, 1996 [was] a mediocre year
for bonds," says William Lloyd, director of portfolio strategies for Credit
Suisse First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>But corporate treasurers relished the bond market's historically low
yields. In fact, the volume of corporate-bond issuance neared a whopping
$405 billion for the year, according to the PSA The Bond Market Trade
Association, close to 1993's record $416 billion mark. Corporate-bond
issuance was especially strong in November and December, to take advantage
of lower bond yields as prices rose.</p>
<p>Investors couldn't have been blamed for seeing January's interest-rate
cut as an indication that they were in for another year of wild
interest-rate swings and corresponding bond volatility. Bonds were hurt in
1994 and early 1995, when the Fed boosted rates to slow a runaway economy,
but optimism was sky-high as 1996 began.</p>
<p>The economy seemed poised to head into a recession, and central bankers
seemed intent on reviving growth through interest-rate cuts, after failing
to inspire the economy with rate reductions in both July and December of
1995. Some also suspected election year-rate cuts might be in the offing,
which inspired more enthusiasm among bond investors.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'A Round-Trip Year'</b></p>
<p>When it soon became apparent that inflation wasn't going to fall any
further and the economy was stronger than expected, wage pressures emerged
as a new concern and bond prices began falling, with corresponding yields
climbing. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond began to rise almost
immediately to peak in July. It stayed high throughout the summer, nearing
the 7.2% peak, before a fall rally brought rates back down again.</p>
<p>Although the Treasury-bond market performed well in the fall, especially
in October and November, as yields on the 30-year bond fell back to the
6.3% region, year-end nervousness limited the market's gains.</p>
<p>It was "a strange year," says Mitchell Held, Smith Barney Inc.'s chief
economist. "The market was beset by changes in expectations -- early on,
many thought we'd get lower short-term interest rates, and then pretty
sharp shifts in respect to economic activity led many to expect higher
rates. The outlook for Fed policy greatly affected the markets."</p>
<p>"It was a round-trip year," quips Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income
strategist at Lehman Brothers Inc. "We hit a peak at about July 5 and
embarked during the remainder of 1996 on a slow, steady descent [in bond
yields], and basically retraced a good deal of the territory, which we gave
up."</p>
<p>Full employment with low inflation and steady growth buoyed bond
investors, as did the shrinking budget deficit. Indeed, the deficit, which
had ballooned in the 1980s, has fallen during the past four years to below
1.5% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Spotlight on Foreign Buyers</b></p>
<p>A major theme of 1996, and a point of both relief and consternation
among market participants, was the growing role that foreign buyers play in
the U.S. market. Foreigners have long been significant players in the U.S.
market. But the flow of funds from overseas picked up in 1996 as the dollar
strengthened. Foreign investment also rose because overseas bond markets
continued to offer paltry yields and the U.S. trade deficit provided
foreign central banks with dollars they were forced to invest.</p>
<p>Foreign governments are estimated to have purchased the bulk of all new
Treasury bonds in 1996. Further, foreigners now hold 30% of total
outstanding Treasurys, according to McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc.,
up from only 20.4% at the end of 1993, as U.S. investors shifted their
focus to stocks and riskier bonds. By the end of the year, concern set in
that this source of support may be drying up. But with interest rates in
Japan still low -- 10-year government securities are yielding less than 3%
-- it is doubtful Japanese investors will suddenly leave the U.S. market en
masse.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Treasury-bond market was overshadowed by the
head-turning successes of emerging markets, high-yield and
nondollar-denominated bonds. The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index
Plus jumped almost 40% for the year, making emerging-markets bonds one of
the few investments that can claim to beat the performance of stocks in
1996. Bond markets in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina showed especially
stellar returns.</p>
<p>Investors in the U.S. also flocked to the junk-bond market, eager to
capture the high yields of a market that returned approximately 13.5% for
the year. Issuers took advantage of the market's performance to issue a
record number of new bonds.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Great Year for Taking Risk'</b></p>
<p>Elsewhere, many nondollar markets rallied sharply, with Italy, Spain and
Sweden leading the way. Indeed, all G-7 economies experienced growth
without inflationary pressures, aiding the performance of bonds.
Asset-backed securities in the U.S. also turned in an impressive
performance, with volume of asset-backed sales setting an all-time record
of $154 billion, according to PSA.</p>
<p>In all, "it was a great year for taking credit risk," concludes Mr.
Lloyd. Even within the investment-grade class, lower rated bonds scored a
higher performance than higher-quality issues.</p>
<p>Innovative products, such as capital securities and 100-year bonds, also
left their mark on the capital markets in 1996. "We're just beginning in
terms of different structures," says Arthur Hyde, Salomon Brothers' head of
debt syndication. "People are searching for yield and are a lot more open
to new ideas."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, although most Wall Street economists don't envision a
full-fledged U.S. recession until 1999, the economy's expansion is starting
to show signs of age. Growing household-financial burdens concern some
economists, while others worry that high employment levels will lead to
higher pay, and in turn inflation. As a result, few predict a bull market
for bonds, because fixed-income assets lose value when inflation rears its
ugly head or interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Japanese Demand</b></p>
<p>Still, there are as many reasons for the Fed to cut rates to spur a
lethargic economy as there are for higher interest rates to prevent
inflation, and strong positives for bonds do exist. High employment levels
have yet to create inflationary pressures of serious concern and many see a
slow-growth, low-inflationary environment continuing. At the same time,
politicians of all political persuasions are speaking of their intent to
reduce the budget deficit still further, perhaps through a balanced-budget
amendment. Such a move would help bonds, especially those of longer
durations, by promising less bond issuance from the government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreigners have yet to show any intentions of reducing their
spending on U.S. bonds. "We think the degree of foreign buying will
continue," says Mr. Held of Smith Barney. "They still have a lot of dollars
that they have to dispense."</p>
<p>Indeed, as long as interest rates remain low in Japan, demand for U.S.
Treasurys by Japanese investors should remain strong. As a result, most
Wall Street strategists predict bonds will remain in a narrow range during
the coming year, with the yield on the 30-year bond staying in a tight
6%-to-7% range. Investors will likely continue their search for yield, both
in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>In a stable interest-rate environment, some economists believe that
bonds may very well outperform stocks. "I think more money will be made in
bonds" than stocks in 1997, says Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase
Manhattan Corp.'s regional bank. "The coupon and capital gains could mean
15% to 20% in total return while stocks will do well to go up 1% to
2%."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Municipal Issues Survived Talk<br>
Of Flat Tax, but Risks Still Loom</h2>

<p><b>By C<font size="-1">HARLES</font> G<font size="-1">ASPARINO</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>The good news is that life in the municipal-bond market returned to
normal in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investors have shaken off fears that the federal government will impose
a flat tax, and wipe out the advantage of buying tax-exempt securities.
Municipal-bond issuance has bounced back, surpassing 1995 levels. Even the
usually staid municipal-bond mutual funds have done well, outperforming
other fixed-income investments even before their tax advantage is figured
in.</p>
<p>Muni funds posted average gains of 3.12% through Dec. 26, according to
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., compared with 2.76% for taxable
corporate-bond funds.</p>
<p>Now the bad news: As any seasoned municipal-bond professional will tell
you, danger lurks around every corner in the muni market. Fiscal disasters,
tax-law changes and the fickle nature of bond sales are systemic to the
$1.3 trillion municipal-bond market.</p>
<p>"This is a market that's always nervous about something," says Michael
Shamosh, a fixed-income strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York. "If
it's not credit problems, it's Congress doing away with the tax exemption,
general interest rates, or Miami defaulting on its debt."</p>
<p>So, if you're a muni-bond investor, either through mutual funds or
buying securities directly, here are a few things to watch for in the new
year:</p>
<p><b>Tax-code overhaul.</b> Congress may not
be talking flat tax now, but no one believes the topic to be dead.
Investors should be heartened by the re-election of President Clinton, a
former governor who may be the market's biggest advocate in Washington. But
Mr. Clinton has been known to change his mind, particularly if he can win
some political points, and Republicans have regained control of both houses
of Congress. Investors can expect more talk about making the tax code
"flatter and fairer." And there could be discussions about eliminating the
tax-exempt advantage of municipal issues altogether.</p>
<p><b>Fiscal disasters.</b> It seems like
there's always another Orange County, Calif., waiting to take muni
investors by surprise. The latest example comes from Miami, where city
officials recently shocked the municipal-bond market by revealing a $68
million gap in its $300 million budget. City officials now say the deficit
could be larger, and the city may need to file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>All this occurred under the noses of the big bond-rating agencies --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. both failed
to inform investors about Miami's fiscal woes before it was too late. Only
after the problems were made public did the bond raters downgrade Miami's
debt to below-investment grade from relatively high ratings, as the value
of the securities began to slide.</p>
<p><b>Regulatory crackdowns.</b> The Securities
and Exchange Commission has launched an unprecedented crackdown on fraud
and abuse in the municipal-bond market. Federal regulators say the
investigations of muni practices are needed to restore order and confidence
to a market where political connections have often meant more than
financial expertise in winning bond deals. Nearly every major firm that
underwrites municipal bonds has come under the spotlight.</p>
<p>Several major firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres
&amp; Co., have settled with the SEC without being formally charged and
paid millions of dollars in fines. At least one major banker has been
sentenced following a conviction on numerous counts of violating securities
laws.</p>
<p>Even less formal scrutiny has affected investors, as bonds that become
the focus of any kind of probe often fall dramatically in value. Some bonds
sold by the Camden County, N.J., Municipal Utilities Authority, for
example, lost an estimated $25 per $1,000 in face value after it was
disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service is conducting a "routine audit"
of the securities.</p>
<p><b>Lean times.</b> People who make their
living selling municipal bonds will continue to face lean times in the
years ahead, as state and local governments look to cut costs by scaling
back on their borrowing. Underwriting margins are tight because of
increased competition for less business, and there's nothing to change the
profit squeeze unless more firms pull out. A number of firms have withdrawn
from the municipal bond underwriting business in recent years, including
Lazard Freres, Credit Suisse First Boston and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.</p>
<p>In terms of new municipal-bond issuance, the Public Securities
Association, a Washington trade group, says state and local governments
sold about $183.4 billion of securities by the end of the year, and will
sell about the same amount in 1997. Although that's up from about $160
billion in 1995, it's significantly less than what municipalities were
issuing as recently as 1993.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Yields on CDs, Money Funds<br>
Left Investors Wanting More</h2>

<p><b>By E<font size="-1">ILEEN</font> K<font size="-1">INSELLA</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>No news may be good news, but for yield-hungry investors, the returns of
the past year had to be downright disappointing when compared with the
feast that equity investors enjoyed.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>For the most part, 1996 was a nonevent for short-term interest rates,
and for yields. With the exception of a dip in mid-February following the
Federal Reserve Board's rate cut, and an anemic rebound, yields on bank
certificates of deposit at year end seemed to mirror the numbers of a year
earlier. A one-year certificate of deposit, for instance, was yielding an
average 4.95% at year end, almost exactly where it was in late 1995,
according to Banxquote Money Markets Inc., a Fairfield, N.J., information
service.</p>
<p>Money-market mutual funds may have been a bright spot in 1995, but there
was no encore performance in 1996. The average seven-day compound yield on
a taxable money fund hovered around 4.85% for most of the year, after
tumbling from an average 5.28% in the first quarter, according to IBC's
Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter. The average seven-day
compound yield on tax-free funds also fell, to 2.98% from 4.03% at the
start of the year. Compound yields assume the reinvestment of
dividends.</p>
<p>Long-term securities fared somewhat better. The benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond ended 1996 yielding 6.64%, compared with 5.9% the previous
December.</p>
<p>But there has been a noticeable reversal of the pattern for long-term
CDs, which typically offer higher yields than short-term instruments, says
Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,
newsletter. "When you see a number of banks begin bringing down long-term
yields faster than short-term [yields], that's a tip that institutions
anticipate lower numbers ahead," says Mr. Heady.</p>
<p>Another bit of bad news to add to cash investors' woes is the strong
increase in bank fees and charges on deposit accounts in 1996, which only
further eat away at already modest yields.</p>
<p>Although no cash investments escaped the overall damping effect of the
low-interest-rate environment, some financial planners stress the value of
the greater liquidity that money-market mutual funds and short-term
Treasurys offer, even if they can't boast higher yields.</p>
<p>"You're always better off buying a five-year Treasury than a five-year
CD," says Ronald W. Roge, a financial planner in Centereach, N.Y., "since
there is much more flexibility and generally more return than a bank
CD."</p>
<p>Investors still like money funds, despite their lackluster yield
performance. As of mid-December, combined assets in taxable and tax-free
money funds had grown $156 billion to more than $900 billion, a 20.5%
increase for the year, to surpass bond funds, says Peter Crane, managing
editor of IBC's Money Fund Report.</p>
<p>Because money funds pass through directly to investors the return on the
funds' investments, they typically have higher yields than short-term CDs.
They also are liquid and offer relatively low risk, although unlike CDs
they aren't federally insured. "They are a better deal for the depositor
and we're of the opinion that the risk is negligible," says Mr. Crane,
noting tighter Securities and Exchange Commission regulation of the funds.
Money funds also have been helped by the overall popularity of mutual
funds, he adds.</p>
<p>An increasing number of banks now offer their own mutual funds, which
has shifted some of the focus away from a hard sell of CDs. Still, CDs
remain attractive to certain investors. John B. Ward, president of First
American Bank  in Chicago, says First American hasn't seen significant
outflows. Although he concedes that the bank has adjusted rates upward to
attract money, he says that overall the yields have performed well
considering the interest-rate environment.</p>
<p>Mr. Heady of Bank Rate Monitor also says CDs stood their ground, based
on his own return analysis. Based on a $10,000 investment made at the start
of the year, and assuming reinvested dividends, a one-year CD would have
returned $493, a sliver above the $490 return yielded on a one-year
Treasury bill, through mid-December.</p>
<p>The best hope for yields in 1997 is that the Federal Reserve deems it
necessary to step in and tighten interest rates, a move some economists
think may be likely by mid-1997. Yields on cash investments would quickly
follow such a jump. "Obviously the Fed will become worried if what is
driving the market is not rational. If that bubble breaks it will cause a
lot of damage, says Jim Glassman, a senior economist with Chase Securities
Inc.</p>
<p>Recently, Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., has warned of an imminent correction in the stock market and boosted
his recommended cash levels from zero to 15%.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward of First American Bank believes people will quickly see the
appeal of certificates of deposit when such an event occurs. "If a lot of
money comes out of the stock market in a hurry, investors are going to be
looking for a safe place to park it," says Mr. Ward.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">In Shadow of the Rally in Stocks,<br>
Some Commodity Sectors Soared</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">ARON</font> L<font size="-1">UCCHETTI</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Despite a roller-coaster year in several commodities markets, with
plenty of opportunities for profit, the overall picture was overshadowed by
the glimmering performance of stocks.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"With the stock market going up on a sustained basis, it's hard to take
notice of a lot of the opportunities in the commodities markets," says
David Rinehimer, director of futures research at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>But some select opportunities stood out in 1996, with several
commodities setting records and experiencing unprecedented price moves.</p>
<p>In grains, for example, the expectations of a drought in the spring
prompted an enormous price increase, taking corn and wheat prices to record
levels this summer. Energy futures prices also set records, with natural
gas posting an all-time-high price last month, more than $1 per million
British thermal units higher than last winter's peak. And crude-oil futures
prices also spiked in the last three months of the year, flirting with the
$27-a-barrel mark for the first time since the Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Sumitomo's Trading Losses</b></p>
<p>"On a price-action basis, you couldn't ask for a better year," says Neal
Shear, managing director for Morgan Stanley in New York. "The trend was
very rewarding for those who were long."</p>
<p>Despite notable upswings in some commodity prices however, the most
striking price move of the year was downward -- in copper. This summer,
copper-futures prices tumbled 35% over a little more than two months when
Sumitomo Corp. revealed huge trading losses blamed on head metals trader
Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>Since then, regulators and exchanges have been looking to improve
safeguards, copper prices have struggled to recover and many banks and
dealers have felt the repercussions of Sumitomo's $2.6 billion loss.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Flat Trading Volume</b></p>
<p>Overall, U.S. trading volume for commodities futures flattened, rising
only 0.24% over the first 11 months of 1996, according to the Futures
Industry Association. Those numbers disappointed some market participants
who expected the market to bounce back after 1995's declines of about 6.6%.
"The economic atmosphere wasn't conducive to strong commodity markets in
1996," says William O'Neill, chief futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
"We can't get too much worse."</p>
<p>Specifically, commodities bears say that the current stock-market boom
and low inflation growth doesn't encourage general investment in hard
assets. They say once a correction in the stock market comes, a rise in
general commodities prices will follow.</p>
<p>But other commodity-fund managers say opportunities exist in commodities
right now. In fact, while the Knight-Ridder-Commodity Research Bureau Index
reflected little movement in commodities prices when compared with January
1996, the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index increased about
5%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Good Year for GSCI</b></p>
<p>The return on a long GSCI investment was about 32% in 1996, the best
year for the index since 1989. Most of the returns didn't come from
long-term price increases, but sudden jumps accentuated by short-term
supply crunches. "The tight inventories turned small events into large
events," says Steven Strongin, chief commodities strategist at Goldman
Sachs.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the GSCI investment in spot-month contracts got lucky
in a year when oil prices showed the only significant, sustained growth.
Further, the index was helped by the growth of just-in-time inventory
strategies, a trend that strengthens demand for short-term futures
contracts. Even Mr. Strongin expects 1997 to be potentially less
price-friendly for commodities investors, predicting declines in returns
from agricultural commodity and metals investments.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some markets:</p>
<p><b>PRECIOUS METALS:</b> At the beginning of
1996, traders asked, "Can the price of gold hit $400?" Now, 1997 beckons
with a new question: "How low can it go?"</p>
<p>Excluding last January's $20 a troy ounce upward run for the precious
metal, gold prices have been in the doldrums, dropping about 11% since the
beginning of February.</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the year, concern about global markets" pushed the
price of gold higher, says Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch. But then the bond
market and the stock market persevered, "and it's been like Chinese water
torture [for gold] -- losing 10 cents here, 10 cents there."</p>
<p>Analysts say the fundamentals affecting gold prices are shifting. The
growth of financial instruments for investing in foreign currencies and
interest rates has partially eclipsed gold's traditional role as a hedge to
economic hard times.</p>
<p>But with stocks and bonds posting healthy returns in 1996, it was hardly
a time to test that theory. "There was almost a universe of gloom in the
gold market," says Andy Smith, precious-metals analyst for UBS Ltd. in
London. "There's hardly a fundamental argument to buy it."</p>
<p>Indeed, producers, banks and investors all had reason to sell in 1996.
Producers sold forward, or locked in prices for future sales, thereby
driving prices down.</p>
<p>In Europe, some central banks, feeling pressure to meet European
Monetary Union financial requirements to reduce debt, have considered
selling gold. Debate has raged recently in the gold community on whether or
not the potential selling will actually occur, but for many market
participants, the rumors have been enough to keep a steady downward
pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group in New York, says
producers and central banks have had less impact when compared with daily
traders who kept gold in a narrow trading range since the middle of 1996.
"When the price gets to $380 [a troy ounce], they sell, and when it gets to
$370, they buy," says Mr. Christian. "The volatility has been largely
absent."</p>
<p>Silver and platinum prices also declined in 1996. For silver, demand is
increasing world-wide, especially in photography. But total mining
production also is increasing and is projected to shoot up an additional
10% in 1997. For platinum, increasing reliance on cheaper alternatives such
as palladium and aluminum are hurting demand somewhat, especially in
industrial sectors.</p>
<p>For 1997, analysts predict little change in precious metals' trading
range unless the stock market experiences a significant correction of 10%
or more.</p>
<p><b>COPPER:</b> Six months after the
announcement of billion-dollar trading losses at Sumitomo, the copper
futures market is still trying to recover.</p>
<p>Copper-futures prices gained back about half the losses from a plunge
last summer that took prices to 85 cents from about $1.30 a pound. Now,
analysts and traders looking toward 1997 differ on whether or not the
market can fully recover to pre-Sumitomo prices.</p>
<p>In fact, there is now a heightened degree of skepticism in this market,
reflecting the possibility that other hidden stockpiles will turn up on the
market. "There are still several issues with Sumitomo," says Richard
Hirsch, vice president of metals trading for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in
New York. "First, has the position been completely closed or
transferred?"</p>
<p>Such skepticism restrained price increases the last two months of 1996,
despite the six-year record-low inventory stockpiles at the London Metal
Exchange. Although the price moved up to modest post-Sumitomo highs of
about $1.10 a pound on Comex, analysts say a similar price increase in 1995
would have sent the market near $1.50 or above. "The price didn't move
higher because of the fallout of Sumitomo and the constant rumors about
stocks," says Bette Raptopoulos,  copper analyst for Prudential Securities
in New York. The Sumitomo trading losses "demoralized the market and
destabilized it."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Sumitomo incident also put the copper market on edge for any
sign of new supplies. When a report emerged in November that 500,000 metric
tons of copper were being stored in Rotterdam warehouses, copper futures
prices fell several cents before discounting the rumor as a statistical
error.</p>
<p>Some analysts expect a bumpy return to pre-Sumitomo prices. James Steel
of Refco Inc. in New York, for instance, predicts the supply of copper will
outpace demand, keeping prices on a downward trend in 1997. "The market
will be close to deluged with supply," says Mr. Steel. "Latin America is
coming on like a storm, and there's a chance for double-digit production
increases in Chile and Peru."</p>
<p>Ms. Raptopoulos is much more bullish for 1997, forecasting a return to
pre-Sumitomo prices of about $1.30 to $1.40 a pound. "Because I believe
that the economy will fare well, my perception is quite constructive," says
Ms. Raptopoulos.</p>
<p><b>CRUDE OIL:</b> A funny thing happened
while Iraq was getting ready to get back into the crude-exporting business:
Oil prices climbed. And a funnier thing happened after Baghdad and the
United Nations finally came to terms on implementing the long-awaited
oil-for-food accord: Prices continued to move up.</p>
<p>But 1996 was just that kind of year. With exceptionally lean
inventories, very strong demand and a long, chilly 1995-96 winter, futures
trading could hardly be expected to be placid. It wasn't, and Iraq added
more volatility to a mercurial mix that produced a better than 50% increase
in the value of the near-month crude contract on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.</p>
<p>The contract hit its low mark of $17.45 a barrel early in 1996, on Jan.
29. By that time, Baghdad had sent signals that it was, finally, serious
about negotiating with the U.N. over Resolution 986, which the Security
Council passed in 1995 to let Iraq sell as much as $1 billion of crude
every 90 days for the purchase of humanitarian goods and services. The
specter of the unleashing of more than 500,000 barrels of new oil onto the
market each day pushed prices down, though not for long.</p>
<p>It turned out that the world actually needed Iraqi oil, and when
implementation of the accord was abruptly called off in the summer, the
industry, which had for several months been counting on the extra supplies,
was disappointed. Then, in December, when the first barrels began to leave
Iraq, the contract reached its year's high of $26.75 a barrel  as cold
weather settled across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Is there an end to the rally in sight in 1997? "That depends a lot on
inventories, and the weather," says Andrew Dickson with GSC Energy Corp.
Another long and cold winter could put enough stress on the system to keep
the pressure on prices, and skimpy inventories of both crude and petroleum
products will make traders nervous, often a prescription for a bull
market.</p>
<p><b>NATURAL GAS:</b> Cold-winter spurts
pushed natural-gas prices up to record prices in 1996, a volatile year. A
colder-than-normal January and February combined with a chilly November to
keep storage levels low and prices high.</p>
<p>In fact, the price of natural gas beat its old record price from 1995 by
a dollar, hitting $4.60 per million British thermal units Dec. 16 before
losing nearly $2 in the last two weeks of the year. "Weather came into
play, and we had a pretty dynamic market," says John Saucer, energy analyst
at Smith Barney in Houston.</p>
<p>Commercial firms and speculators drove up prices from the year's low in
September of about $1.80, to more than double in less than three months. In
1995, "we had different weather patterns," says Michael Barbis, natural-gas
analyst for UBS Securities in New York. "Then, the cold was focused to the
east;" [in 1996], the cold really spread everywhere."</p>
<p>The increase in prices was accentuated in November, when below-normal
temperatures blanketed high-consuming regions in the Midwest and Northeast.
Meanwhile, supplies were low, analysts say, partially because of a slowing
of imports from Canada. Storage levels also were depleted because of the
cold winter in 1995-96, which kept levels behind all year. "We entered
[1996] with storage well below [1995], and then had one of the coldest
Novembers on record," says Gerry Saccente,  a natural-gas trader for
Chicago Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks of the year, however, the weather turned warmer
and prices shifted down below $3 a million BTUs. The price this year could
fall into a lower range than 1996 because of an expected 2% increase in
U.S. production, analysts say.</p>
<p><b>GRAINS:</b> Futures markets for corn,
wheat and soybeans have a tough act to follow in 1997.</p>
<p>The past 12 months featured some of the most volatile grain prices in
recent history, as weather moved the market dramatically. Records were set
for both price and volume.</p>
<p>The moves were considerable to say the least. Corn-futures prices
marched up 57% from the beginning of the year to a record-setting $5.48 a
bushel in July. But then, prices plunged 51% to year lows in December to
below $2.60 a bushel. Wheat-futures prices also skyrocketed to an all-time
high to about $7 a bushel, doubling in prices since early 1995. But
better-than-expected weather and a significant increase in world-wide
supply popped the overblown market in a matter of weeks, bringing prices
down below $4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Agricultural trading volume at the Chicago Board of Trade increased
dramatically in 1996 to record levels, up 40% on soybeans, 35% on corn, and
13% on wheat. On the Tokyo Grain Exchange, corn futures volume more than
doubled and soybean volume more than tripled.</p>
<p>Increasing world-wide demand and an expectation of record-low crop
production because of unfavorable weather led to high prices early in 1996.
For wheat, conditions stayed dry through May, while for corn and soybeans,
weather remained dry in key producing regions into June. Because of the
weather early in the year, the nation's granaries held a precariously low
amount, just 426 million bushels of corn at one point in September, the
lowest level since the '70s.</p>
<p>But just when supply concerns pushed prices into the record-breaking
range, rains and international supply spoiled the bullish party. Analysts
say farmers planted eight million more acres of corn alone in 1996, and
large crops also came from Europe, Australia and South America. "The high
prices encouraged shifts in planting -- area and yield went up," explains
Dale Gustafson, grains analyst for Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Weather also influenced supply and a crop that far-exceeded original
expectations. Timely summer rains and warm temperatures late into the
season boosted the 1996 U.S. corn and soybean crop to near record
levels.</p>
<p>Several factors will add to further rebuilding of supplies in coming
years, analysts say. First, genetically enhanced crops could increase
yields as the acceptance of the concept grows gradually. Also,
freedom-to-farm legislation passed in the U.S. in 1996, and gaining
momentum world-wide, will allow farmers to build up supplies when market
conditions warrant.</p>
<p>Analysts expect 1997 prices to stay in ranges well below last year's
unprecedented postings. Wheat is expected to average about $4 a bushel and
corn about $2.60, on strong harvests and weaker export demand. On the
upside, analysts say a growing livestock sector could increase demand for
grains in the coming year.</p>
<p>Soybean demand could outpace its grain cousins because of the rapid
growth in China, which recently switched from being an exporter to an
importer of soybean products. "If there are any problems with production,
the market is liable to have a large price advance. There's no cushion in
supply," says Anne Frick, analyst for Prudential Securities in New
York.</p>
<p>More bearish analysts say the price will generally stay below $7 a
bushel on the likelihood that many U.S. farmers will shift production from
corn to soybeans in 1997. Also, they say moist growing conditions in South
America will lead to record crops there.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Dollar Poised to Rise Further,<br>
But the Rally May Fade Later</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>If you want to bet on the dollar in 1997, move fast.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's the view of the gurus who get paid big bucks for advising
multinational corporations, institutional investors and governments on
which way the fickle foreign-exchange market is headed. Nearly all see the
greenback continuing to climb early on, only to fade as the year
progresses. Where they differ is in the timing and degree of the
decline.</p>
<p>"We may see 1.60 marks and maybe" a higher dollar against the yen in the
first half of 1997, says James O'Neill, chief currency economist at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in London. "The U.S. economy is in pretty
reasonable shape by most standards, and [Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan
Greenspan is doing a spectacular job." Additional dollar props, he says,
include "the dreadful gloom in Japan and the great uncertainty in Europe
about EMU" -- European economic and monetary union, slated for 1999.</p>
<p>Then comes the bad news. Mr. O'Neill is among those who believe that as
the year progresses, financing a growing U.S. trade deficit will become
increasingly difficult. "And in the second half of the year, people are
going to worry about a turnaround in both European and Japanese interest
rates as their economies gather further steam."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>No Interest in a Rising Dollar</b></p>
<p>In 12 months, Mr. O'Neill sees the dollar falling back to 1.45 marks and
105 yen.</p>
<p>Michael Burke, a Citibank economist, is even more pessimistic. His
six-month forecast roughly matches Mr. O'Neill's year-end projection. By
December 1997, Mr. Burke figures the dollar will be at 1.40 marks and 95
yen, respectively 9% and 18% weaker than now.</p>
<p>"The yen will be the strongest of the three major currencies" this year,
says Mr. Burke. Like Mr. O'Neill, he sees the dollar being unhinged by a
pickup in Japan's economy and a rising Japanese bilateral trade surplus
with the U.S.</p>
<p>What's more, he says, Washington and Tokyo have no interest in a
steadily rising dollar. "In the U.S., industry and labor could renew their
complaints about international competitiveness," says Mr. Burke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he argues that Japanese corporations have already adjusted to
a stronger yen by shifting production capacity to less-expensive regions.
"Any further weakness for the yen makes that shift unprofitable," says Mr.
Burke.</p>
<p>That's a different story from 1996, when foreign central banks cut
interest rates and purchased record amounts of U.S. Treasurys in an attempt
to push the dollar higher, boost exports, quicken growth and lower
unemployment.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'The Comeback Kid'</b></p>
<p>For the dollar, 1996 was the year of "the comeback kid." At year end,
the dollar stood at 1.54 marks and 115.85 yen,  compared with 1.4360 marks
and 103.50 when it began. "The dominant theme in all financial markets was
the willingness of the Japanese and Germans to devote monetary policy
almost entirely to undermining their currencies," says Kit Juckes, a
currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London.</p>
<p>A second, related, major theme in 1996 was "the pursuit of yield," says
Ravi Bulchandani, an international economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
London. "Currencies with high yields did well; that can be seen especially
in sterling, where interest-rate increases and the prospect for more to
come turbocharged the currency 10% against the dollar and nearly 19%
against the mark." At the same time, low-yielding currencies such as the
yen and Swiss franc sank, 11% and more than 14%, respectively against the
dollar.</p>
<p>Not expecting much change in those twin dollar supports in 1997, Mr.
Bulchandani predicts the U.S. currency will rise to as high as 1.65 marks
and 120 yen by late June before retreating to 1.60 marks and 114 yen in
December. He sees the dollar buoyed by "higher [U.S.] rates based on strong
economic growth and official preference for a stronger dollar."</p>
<p>The greenback's biggest threat, he says, would be recession, which
Morgan Stanley economists don't expect. Unlike Messrs. O'Neill and Burke,
he doubts the U.S. trade deficit will be a big "dollar negative" unless it
worsens significantly. "The trade account is a known problem," he says. The
EMU is a wild card. But Mr. Bulchandani says it won't be a big "dollar
negative/Deutsche mark positive" unless Europe abandons the single-currency
project altogether, which he doubts.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>A Different Angle</b></p>
<p>Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union Bank of
Switzerland in London comes to similar conclusions, but from a different
angle. Based on the 66% correlation between Japan's current account surplus
as a percentage of overall economic growth and the yen's trade-weighted
index, albeit with a 12 to 14 quarter lag, he says that "even if the
surplus begins to rise, there would be a considerable lag before that trend
adversely impacted the dollar."</p>
<p>Other dollar supports, says Mr. Chertkow, are Japan's low-interest-rate
policy, "encouraging Japanese life-insurance companies to search for higher
yields in overseas markets, particularly the U.S. Treasury market," and the
Bank of Japan's determination to prevent the dollar from sliding below the
100-yen level.</p>
<p>As for Europe, he argues that Germany and France need a strengthening
dollar "to facilitate entry into the brave new world on Jan. 1, 1999," when
the single currency is to take effect.</p>
<p>Messrs. O'Neill and Burke regard such forecasts as too rosy. "To break
out of its long-term downtrend -- dating back to 1973 when the U.S. went
off the gold standard -- the dollar will need to get above 1.60 marks and
stay there," says Mr. Burke. He also contends the Bundesbank can't "devalue
its way out of a weak economy" by letting the mark weaken beyond 1.60
"because foreigners, who already own over one trillion Deutsche marks,
could flee."</p>
<p>Goldman's Mr. O'Neill cautions, "At some stage [this] year, the
liquidity boom [that has fueled a stronger dollar and global stock and
bond-market rallies] will come to an end."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Fuel 80's-Style Art Rally,<br>
With Help of Celebrity Auctions</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">LEXANDRA</font> P<font size="-1">EERS</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Spurred on by a climbing stock market, in 1996, collectors of art and
antiques lifted some prices back to the levels of the roaring 1980s.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>But the art-market rally wasn't really about paintings. While there were
some strong sales in the core fields of contemporary and Impressionist art,
the eyebrow-raising prices were paid for celebrity collectibles (the
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate sale brought $34.4 million), for Asian
art and for American paintings (a record of $11.1 million was set for a
John Singer Sargent). Perhaps most surprisingly, a spectacular sterling
silver soup tureen sold for $10.3 million.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a strong year for the decorative arts, normally
considered second-tier to the paintings market. Museum exhibitions such as
the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Charles Rennie Mackintosh show and the
traveling exhibition of the craftsmanship of Faberge were among the most
successful of the year.</p>
<p>But the market's general resurgence came too late for many galleries,
some of which took on so much debt in the 1980s that even a pickup in sales
wasn't sufficient to handle the load. Among the closing galleries was
veteran Old Masters dealership Colnaghi, which closed its Madison Avenue
operations, and Peter Joseph, a leader in the furniture field.</p>
<p>In some cases, the market's recovery was overstated. While
contemporary-art sales improved -- the top-selling artwork of the year was
a Willem de Kooning that brought $15.6 million at Christie's International
PLC -- the demand was limited to older, established contemporary
artists.</p>
<p>There were a few "staggeringly obscene" auction prices, but the middle
market was "sluggish with occasional bursts of enthusiasm," says New York
art dealer David Killen.</p>
<p>Among younger artists, those working in video or other untraditional
media captured much of the attention. Matthew Barney, who has done
avant-garde films and performance art, won the prestigious Hugo Boss prize,
a new hotly contested grant from the German clothing firm.</p>
<p>In the nonprofit sector, competition for donor dollars was never
fiercer. The Shelburne Museum of Art in Vermont took the controversial step
of selling several works of art to raise operating funds; a series of
auctions in November raised $32.8 million. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
in New York also is strapped for cash.</p>
<p>The London art market lost much business to New York, especially late in
the year when the pound strengthened, prompting Christie's Chief Executive
Christopher Davidge to relocate to the U.S., at least temporarily.</p>
<p>This year look for both major auction houses to move their U.S.
headquarters: Sotheby's Holdings Inc. to New York's Columbus Circle, a more
central location than its current site on the East Side; and Christie's to
a retrofitted garage in Rockefeller Center that offers more space than its
current quarters. Expect the two major museum openings scheduled for this
year to be postponed because of construction delays: the Richard
Meier-designed complex that is the new Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the
Guggenheim's new satellite museum in Bilboa, Spain.</p>
<p>Competition between the auction houses will heat up in the fields of
jewelry, American furniture and contemporary art. And there is likely to be
an announcement from Sotheby's that the personal effects of the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor will be going on the auction block.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bets on China and Hong Kong<br>
Paid Off for Investors in Asia</h2>

<p>China and its neighbors -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- were the right Asian
bets for investors in 1996. Japan's stock market again proved disappointing
as an economic recovery there sputtered.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>In Hong Kong, which many American investors treat as a proxy for China,
the Hang Seng Index surged 34% in 1996. The property market, which plays a
huge role in the land-short colony's economy, perked up amid growing
confidence in a smooth transition from British to Chinese rule  July 1 --
and hopes that wealthy mainland Chinese would snap up luxury apartments and
office space.</p>
<p>China's own stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen lived up to their
reputation for giving investors a wild ride. After a long period of steep
decline, they skyrocketed in 1996.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, results were mixed last year. The Taipei market,
whose results often reflect events in Hong Kong and China, soared. Stocks
slipped in Singapore, but rose in neighboring Malaysia. Markets in
Australia and New Zealand rose about 10%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">European Stocks, Hot Last Year,<br>
Could Lose Some Steam in 1997</h2>

<p>The word in Europe is that the party can't last forever.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>While investors are toasting high double-digit gains from most European
markets in 1996, analysts already are starting to warn that 1997 might be a
bit more sober. "The year was characterized by a universal bull market in
equities," says Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW Ltd. in London.
"But 1997 is going to be a bit patchy. We are going to get a much more
subdued performance next year."</p>
<p>On average, European stocks rose 20% last year, according to the Eurotop
100 index, below the performance of U.S. stocks but far better than
slumping Japanese stocks. Returns in individual European countries ranged
as high as 52% in Helsinki and 28% in Frankfurt to as low as 12% in
Britain. The sectors that have performed well include chemicals, metals,
oils, telecommunications and some consumer stocks, such as home furnishings
and retailers.</p>
<p>Low inflation, low interest rates, slow growth and strong bond markets
fueled stock gains in 1996. But analysts say the current environment can't
get much better, so the chance for disappointment is becoming more likely.
Although interest rates are expected to stay low until the end of 1997,
there is greater pressure on earnings to grow enough to justify high stock
prices.</p>
<p>And the fuel bonds received from countries working to meet
budget-deficit requirements in the beginning stages of European Monetary
Union has run its course beyond realistic expectations, analysts say.</p>
<p>"Far too much weight has been placed on EMU, which has created a bit of
a bubble, and the markets are looking ready for a correction," Mr. Bell
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell says investors who are looking for big double-digit returns
will have to turn to Asia, excluding Japan. But in Europe, he says there is
a chance that the U.K. could be a "dark horse" and end up a strong
performer because its economy is growing faster compared with Continental
countries. Overall, he predicts European shares will have about a 9% return
in 1997.</p>
<p>Mike Young, European strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, paints a bit
more positive picture of Europe in 1997. He says Europe still has a strong
economic-recovery story that could generate better-than-expected earnings
in areas such as Germany, Scandinavia and Spain, which could be among the
best performers in 1997.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Americas Markets Follow<br>
Wildly Different Courses</h2>

<p>Markets in the Americas set wildly different courses in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Some surged ahead of strong returns in the U.S. -- the Venezuelan market
was one of the best performers in the world. Canada to the north and Mexico
to the south posted returns more or less in line with the U.S., while a few
smaller markets posted losses for the year.</p>
<p>As the new year begins, conventional wisdom is that Canada, Venezuela,
Brazil and Argentina already have enjoyed their better runs, while Mexico
and Colombia are expected to move higher. Chile and Peru appear to be ready
to emerge, modestly, from their 1996 doldrums.</p>
<p>Looking forward, economic factors are expected to be more meaningful to
market watchers than political ones. Inflation, the scourge of the region
for most of the past two decades, has been largely tamed. The
French-English controversy has been settled (momentarily) in Canada, while
coups and revolutions seem relegated to Latin America's stormy past.</p>
<p>Not that political tremors have disappeared. The end of 1996 saw a
resurgence of terrorism in Peru and Colombia, while throughout the past
year, political scandal roiled markets from Mexico to Argentina.</p>
<p>However, in most markets the closely watched indicators for coming
months will be things such as trade figures, oil prices, and
government-spending deficits. While Canada continues to be our most
dependable trading partner, Latin America is beginning to emerge as a
"mature" emerging market.</p>
<p>For investors, that means the roller-coaster days may be behind them.
But so are the easy profits and spectacular losses.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">New Company Stock Listings<br>
Rise on Big Board and Nasdaq</h2>

<p><b>By D<font size="-1">EBORAH</font> L<font size="-1">OHSE</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>The two largest markets in the U.S. had a bumper crop of new companies
listing with them for the first time during 1996 -- a year in which record
numbers of companies came public for the first time and a roaring bull
market enticed scores of foreign companies to U.S. markets.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The New York Stock Exchange, the nation's largest market, added 279
companies' names to its listings, while the No. 2 Nasdaq Stock Market added
1,009 new companies.</p>
<p>Of course, both lost companies as well. On Nasdaq, hundreds of companies
were delisted, and a record 97 defected to the Big Board during the year,
leaving Nasdaq with 5,576 companies listed on its market at year end, 454
more than the previous year. That fell short of 1993's record of 498 net
Nasdaq additions. The Big Board, which has a rule effectively barring most
companies from defecting to other markets, ended 1996 with 2,907 listed
companies, a net gain of 232 companies.</p>
<p>Nasdaq, true to its reputation as the main home for smaller, start-up
companies, attracted the lion's share of newly public small-capitalization
companies. A total of 687 newly public U.S. companies listed on Nasdaq,
compared with 117 on the Big Board, which has more-stringent listing
standards that may prohibit listing by many less-mature companies. The IPOs
listing on Nasdaq had market caps averaging $174 million. The average
market cap of all the new companies listing on the Big Board, meanwhile,
was around $350 million.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange, which has had trouble competing in recent
years with the Big Board's global stature for larger stocks and Nasdaq's
record in signing up start-up companies, listed only 73 new companies, with
an average market cap of $146.3 million. And factoring in companies that
left, merged with another company or were delisted, the Amex ended the year
with 18 fewer companies than it started with -- although the Amex points
out that it lost fewer companies in 1996 than in the year before.</p>
<p>"Nasdaq's growth was heavily in smaller IPOs, while New York saw a mix
of very large IPOs and major switches from Nasdaq," says Patrick Healy,
president of the Issuer Network, which advises companies on listing issues.
At the same time, he says, while the Amex had an increase in new companies
listing on its exchange, it "had no real large-trading-volume stocks
listing."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, volume surged on the major markets in 1996, although
comparing Nasdaq's volume with that of the Big Board is a tricky matter.
That's because on Nasdaq's dealer market, a single trade is frequently
counted as one purchase and one sale, while on the Big Board's auction
market, the majority of trades are counted as a single transaction. The
different methods result in what some consider double-counting of Nasdaq's
true trading volume.</p>
<p>Still, both Nasdaq and the Big Board reported record years for trading
volume. The average daily volume reported by Nasdaq rose to 543.3 million
shares, up from 401.4 million in 1995, while on the Big Board, daily volume
averaged 411.7 million shares, up from 346.1 million.</p>
<p>The Amex reported daily share volume of only 22.1 million shares on
average in 1996, up from 20 million in 1995.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Big Board Program-Trading<br>
Reached Record Pace in 1996</h2>

<p>NEW YORK -- Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange accounted for
13.3% of overall volume, or an average of 53.5 million daily shares,
through Dec. 20, 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>It was the most active year to date for program trading, in both volume
and percentage, surpassing the previous record of 11.9% in 1993. Program
trading involves the purchase or sale of a basket of at least 15 stocks
with a total value of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>Some critics contend that program trading has contributed to sudden,
sharp swings in the market, and many believe it played a significant role
in the stock-market crash of 1987. Soon after the crash, the Big Board
began releasing program-trading data on a weekly basis in response to
investor concern.</p>
<p>The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which
traders buy and sell groups of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and
options. Through December, index arbitrage accounted for 30.3% of overall
program trading, unchanged from the total through December of the preceding
year.</p>
<p>The two most active program-trading firms through the end of September,
the latest month for which figures were available, were Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co., and First Options of Chicago Inc.</p>
<p>The Big Board's "collar," which is invoked whenever the Dow Jones
Industrial Average moves 50 points or more in a single direction during any
one-hour period, was triggered a record 119 times, sometimes more than once
on a single trading day. The collar forces index arbitrage trades to go
against the trend of the market, in effect slowing down program trades
during a rally or decline.</p>

<p>Tighter and tighter and tighter.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's how the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "collar" feels -- and
likely will continue to feel -- to program traders. The collar, which
restricts their ability to engage in a certain type of computer-guided
trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up or down 50 points
on the day, was almost an every-other-day occurrence in 1996.</p>
<p>All told, the collar was triggered a record 119 times last year, or more
than twice a week. The collar had not been used that many times in the
previous five and a half years, since it was implemented in mid-1990.</p>
<p>Market watchers see frequent triggering of the collar, which was
designed to prevent program traders from aggravating big swings in stock
prices, as a sign of market volatility. But the amount of volatility it
signifies has shrunk considerably: 50 points currently represents only
about 0.75% of the Dow.</p>
<p>Most traders consider a daily gain or loss of less than 1% unremarkable.
But officials of the Big Board aren't persuaded. Though they gave ground
and agreed in 1996 to the first changes in other stock market
"circuit-breakers," they aren't budging on the 50-point collar, officially
known as Rule 80A.</p>
<p>Under pressure from securities regulators, market participants and
officials of other stock markets, Big Board officials proposed increasing
the size of a market drop that would trigger a halt in stock trading. That
proposal calls for markets to shut for 30 minutes whenever the Dow plunges
350 points in a day and for another hour if, after that break, the Dow's
one-day loss grows to 550 points. Those levels currently are set at 250
points and 400 points. The SEC is expected to approve the changes within
several weeks.</p>
<p>Around midyear, the SEC approved the first-ever change in those trading
halt rules, known as Rule 80B. It allowed the Big Board to cut the length
of the halts from their original durations of one hour at 250 points and
two hours at 400 points.</p>
<p>The trading-halt rules have never been used since they were put in place
in 1988 to prevent a repeat of the panic-driven selling that exacerbated
the market crash of October 1987. But a close call in March, when the Dow
plunged nearly 218 points before recovering, led many traders and market
officials to fear that the trigger points were too low, given the Dow's
steady rise in recent years.</p>
<p>While the reasoning that led to the changes in other circuit-breakers
could be applied to the 50-point collar, Big Board officials have
repeatedly vowed that they won't change the collar rule. But if the Dow
rises more than 25% a year for two more years, as it did in the last two,
they may have to eat those words.</p>

<p>NEW YORK --
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mo&amp;page=15">Philip Morris</a> Cos.
ended 1996 as the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, with its $4.80 annual dividend resulting in a yield of about
4.2%.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investment bank
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=jpm&amp;page=15">J.P. Morgan</a> &amp;
Co. was second in terms of yield, at 3.5%, followed by three energy
companies:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tx&amp;page=15">Texaco</a>
Inc., 3.4%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=chv&amp;page=15">Chevron</a>
Corp., 3.25%; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> Corp.,
3.18%.</p>
<p>The next five in order of yield were:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp., 3%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=gm&amp;page=15">General Motors</a> Corp., 2.9%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ip&amp;page=15">International Paper</a> Co., 2.5%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dd&amp;page=15">DuPont</a> Co., 2.4%; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mmm&amp;page=15">Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing</a> Co., 2.3%.</p>
<p>The lowest yielding dividend paying stock in the average was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dis&amp;page=15">Walt Disney</a> Co., 0.6%. Two components,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bs&amp;page=15">Bethlehem Steel</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=z&amp;page=15">Woolworth</a> Corp., pay no dividend.</p>
<p>Many investors follow a strategy of buying the highest-yielding
constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the so-called Dogs of the
Dow, at the start of the year, and holding them for a year. Several
brokerage houses offer unit trusts based on the strategy.</p>

<H1>Audio Round Table</H1>
<h2>Peering Into the Future</h2>
What next?
<P>
Will 1997 bring more of the same for stock investors: moderate economic growth accompanied by a seemingly unstoppable advance on Wall Street? Or has the bull market run its course? Where will the growth sectors be in the year to come, and what areas should investors avoid? Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for new highs, or is the much-feared correction near?
<P>
To get a closer look at these and other issues, The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition asked eight of Wall Street's investment strategists to peer into the future. Although each individual's assessment of the market's outlook varied widely, one consensus emerged: stock investors in 1997 will be in for a bumpy ride.

Most Profitable Year Ever</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>Is there a record for setting records?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>If there is, Wall Street probably snagged that one too in 1996. By most
measures, last year was the biggest, busiest, most profitable year ever for
U.S. financial markets. It had the biggest initial public offering, the
biggest initial public offering by a foreign company and the biggest sale
of 100-year bonds by a U.S. company.</p>
<p>Just about the only front on which it didn't break new ground was in
total sales of new stocks and bonds. Despite a 34% leap from the previous
year, the $953.4 billion raised in 1996 fell short of the $1.05 trillion
raised in 1993, the peak year for sales of mortgage securities, according
to Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>Still, the same near-ideal conditions that drove the stock market to
record after record for the second straight year fueled an impressive
amount of underwriting activity. "Nobody expected this year to be a great
year in the stock market, so everybody was quite surprised," says Richard
Kauffman, head of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., a
unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Backlog of Stock Offerings</b></p>
<p>After a midyear lull, the financial markets came roaring back in the
fourth quarter and appeared to have strong momentum heading into the new
year. Entering January, there is a backlog of almost 200 stock offerings
seeking to raise more than $5 billion, says Securities Data.</p>
<p>In the last three months of 1996, sales of new stocks and bonds totaled
$251.6 billion, up 29% from the fourth quarter of 1995. That surge of
activity added to the windfall on Wall Street: Disclosed fees reaped by
securities firms jumped to a record $9.19 billion for the year.</p>
<p>"This was the busiest fourth quarter I can remember, without question,"
says Arthur Hyde III, head of debt capital markets at Salomon Brothers
Inc.</p>
<p>Low interest rates, steady growth in corporate profits and seemingly
unquenchable investor demand for shares of mutual funds combined to
obliterate the stock underwriting records set in 1993, the previous best
year for stock deals.</p>
<p>A calendar chock-full of initial and follow-on public offerings of stock
in companies young and old, foreign and domestic, churned out $114.9
billion in sales of new stock, according to Securities Data. That surpassed
the $102.4 billion in stock sold in 1993 and marked the fifth time in the
last six years that stock issuance rose from year to year.</p>
<p>A record $49 billion was raised through IPOs, including huge offerings
of stock in units of major companies and the privatization of foreign
businesses that had been state-owned. Some sectors of the fixed-income
market, including high-yield and asset-backed bonds, hit highs in 1996. The
notable exception was the mortgage-backed securities market, which hasn't
recovered since it collapsed in 1994.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co., the
largest securities firm, again was the leading underwriter of all stock and
bond issues, though the next three firms -- in order: Lehman Brothers,
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon -- all closed the gap in market share.
As it did in 1995, Lehman edged out Goldman for second place in total money
raised for issuers, but Goldman did more deals and earned more than twice
as much in disclosed fees.</p>
<p>"It was truly a terrific year, and we surely would take another one like
it," says Brian Hehir, a managing director in Merrill's global equity
capital markets group.</p>
<p>But for the second consecutive year end, even the most optimistic on
Wall Street are asking, How long can this keep going on? For the answer,
some on Wall Street are watching mutual funds and interest rates.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Astounding Inflow of Cash</b></p>
<p>"The key driver of demand has been cash coming into equity mutual
funds," says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Kauffman. An astounding $210 billion
flowed into stock funds in the first 11 months of the year, almost $100
billion more than a year earlier, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a mutual-fund industry group.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to that flow, Mr. Kauffman says, is an abrupt rise in
interest rates. "If interest rates start looking more attractive, there is
a risk that people would decide to switch from stock funds to bond
funds."</p>
<p>Investment pros fear that such a shift could have a more lasting impact
than the early summer sell-off of technology stocks that shook the markets
last year.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kauffman is sanguine about the market for follow-on offerings in
1997. Historically, the year after a large number of companies go public,
many of them return to tap the market again with another stock
offering.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Mergers and Privatizations</b></p>
<p>Absent a sharp rise in interest rates or an external shock to the
markets, investment bankers see continued underwriting activity fueled by
two continuing trends: corporate mergers and restructurings and the
privatization of foreign business, especially telephone companies.</p>
<p>Merger and acquisition activity hit a high in 1996, helping to power the
stock market's gains. But the breaking up of major corporations resulted in
some of the year's biggest new issues.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp.'s public sale of
stock in its equipment division, now named
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> Inc., was the
biggest U.S. IPO and the most lucrative transaction. Underwriters reaped
more than $100 million in fees for selling 112 million shares for $3.03
billion in April.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>King Telekom</b></p>
<p>Far and away the biggest new issue of the year world-wide was the $11.3
billion public sale of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt&amp;page=15">Deutsche Telekom</a>
AG, formerly Germany's state-owned telecommunications company. Goldman
Sachs, the top underwriter of IPOs, managed the sale of $1.6 billion of
Deutsche Telekom's stock in the U.S.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers led the underwriting in November of the U.S. portion of
a $1.03 billion sale of American depositary receipts of Cia Anonima
Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. That deal was done as a standard public
offering because the company "wanted the prestige and stature of a New York
Stock Exchange listing," says Gregory Sacco, managing director in Lehman's
equity syndicate department.</p>
<p>But about one-third of the equity sales Lehman managed in 1996 were a
type of private placement known as 144A that aren't included in Securities
Data's rankings, Mr. Sacco says. Without them, Lehman ranked ninth among
stock underwriters with almost half of its volume of $4.56 billion coming
in the fourth quarter. "We haven't started fast but we've finished fast,"
Mr. Sacco says.</p>
<p>In the bond market, 1996 was a year of megadeals to pay for
megamergers.</p>
<p>To finance its acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lor&amp;page=15">Loral</a> Corp.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a> Corp. sold $3.5 billion of
investment-grade bonds in six separate pieces on a single day in May.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dis&amp;page=15">Walt Disney</a> Co. sold $2.6 billion of bonds in March to help pay
for its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</p>
<p>A clear sign of the confidence investors had about lending money to U.S.
corporations was the record issuance of so-called century bonds, which pay
a set rate of interest for 100 years. In December, in the biggest century
bond offering on record,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ibm&amp;page=15">International Business
Machines</a> Corp. sold $850 million of 100-year bonds. Demand for the
bonds, which were priced to yield 7.22%, was so high the offering was
increased from $600 million.</p>
<p>Until recently, investors would buy 100-year bonds only from the bluest
of blue-chip companies. But several less established borrowers, including a
casino operator and the government of China, sold century bonds in
1996.</p>
<p>Another powerful force in the bond market was the continued growth in
borrowing by foreign entities issuing so-called Yankee bonds. Total sales
of Yankee bonds soared to $89 billion in 1996, almost double the $46.6
billion issued in 1995.</p>
<p>As it did in 1995, Merrill led all underwriters of Yankee bonds with
about 20% of the market. In all, bond sales for foreign issuers is a
growing segment of total debt underwriting for Merrill, rising toward 30%
from about 10% a few years ago, says John Qua, co-head of global debt
capital markets at Merrill.</p>
<p>Mr. Qua says he is "guardedly optimistic" about the outlook for the
corporate bond market in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>"We're generally optimistic rates will stay where they are or go
slightly lower. So, as long as the market stays calm. ...," Mr. Qua
says.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Underwriting Fees Soared<br>
To a Record $9.19 Billion</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">NITA</font> R<font size="-1">AGHAVAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>It was raining fees on Wall Street last year. Disclosed fees for
underwriting stocks and bonds surged 38% to $9.19 billion, breaking Wall
Street's 1993 record of $9.16 billion in underwriting fees, according to
Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., firm that tracks corporate-finance
activity.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The full-year fee totals were helped by a robust fourth quarter, when
fees climbed 14% to $2.46 billion from $2.15 billion in the same period in
1995.</p>
<p>But despite a blockbuster pipeline of new stock and bond issues, few
analysts expect the shower of fees to continue into 1997.</p>
<p>"It was a banner year for Wall Street," said Dean Eberling, a securities
analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "But it creates hurdles in terms of
expectations that are hard to surpass."</p>
<p>Mr. Eberling said that if new cash flowing into mutual funds,
particularly stock funds, continues at the slower pace evident in the
second half of last year, it will be hard for Wall Street firms to
replicate 1996's showing in underwriting.</p>
<p>Behind last year's record fees was a red-hot market for underwriting new
stock issues. Fees for stock underwriting topped $5.8 billion, and
accounted for about two-thirds of total fees, according to Securities
Data.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co., the
top-ranked underwriter of stocks and bonds, was the leading fee-earner,
netting $1.34 billion in disclosed fees last year, mainly on the back of
its bond-underwriting prowess.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. finished second, with $1.2 billion in fees to
its credit for lead-managing domestic stocks and bonds. Goldman's
impressive showing was largely because of its stock-underwriting clout.</p>
<p>Goldman's biggest coup last year was its role in the mammoth offering of
shares in
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt&amp;page=15">Deutsche
Telekom</a> AG, Germany's national telephone monopoly. According to
Securities Data, the deal produced a total of $40.1 million in disclosed
fees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the biggest fee-generating deal last year was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp.'s spinoff of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> -- the largest initial
public offering in U.S. history -- which generated a huge $102.9 million in
fees for Wall Street underwriters. The largest beneficiaries of that were
its joint managers,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ms&amp;page=15">Morgan Stanley</a>
&amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Asset-Backed Securities<br>
Flourish in a Hot Market</h2>

<p><b>By P<font size="-1">ATRICK</font> M<font size="-1">C</font>G<font size="-1">EEHAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>One true gauge of how hot the market is for certain types of securities
is the amount of debate among investment bankers.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>When the disputes grow so numerous and nasty that a summit must be
called to resolve them, the market in question usually is on fire. That was
the case with the market for asset-backed securities in 1996.</p>
<p>Driven by a big run-up in credit-card borrowings, the volume of new
asset-backed issues has nearly tripled in the past four years. Last year,
issuers of asset-backed securities raised $154 billion, a jump of 43% from
the $107.5 billion raised in 1995, according to Securities Data Co. of
Newark, N.J. The number of offerings soared 46% in 1996, rising to 569
issues from 389 in 1995, Securities Data said.</p>
<p>Asset-backed securities are created when banks and other lenders pool
loans they have made and sell pieces of the pool of scheduled repayments to
investors. Lenders use proceeds from the sale of the resulting securities,
which tend to offer slightly higher yields than government bonds, to make
more loans.</p>
<p>Investment banks are rushing to underwrite these deals because the fees
they produce are proportionally bigger than those received from standard
bond offerings, though smaller than the fees from new stock issues.</p>
<p>As usually happens in financial markets, success attracts competition.
For the first time, the top three underwriters controlled less than 45% of
the asset-backed market. And the number of firms that grabbed at least 5%
of the market grew to nine, from six in 1995.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of focus on the asset-backed market," says Jack Ross,
group head of asset-backed finance at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "It's a very
fast-growing market, so there are a lot of people who want to be in it and
be in it in a big way."</p>
<p>But not all firms see the market the same way. There were so many
disagreements about how to define and measure the market that Securities
Data's president, Mark Lerch, called a summit in late November.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Heating Disputes</b></p>
<p>Around a conference table in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Lerch brought
together executives from most of the big firms. Each, it seemed, had his
own ideas about what should or should not count as an asset- backed deal in
the "league tables," the annual rankings of firms by the number and size of
the various stock and bond offerings they underwrite.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the most heated disputes pitted Merrill Lynch against
Lehman Brothers. The two firms vied all year for the top spot in the
asset-backed rankings. Lehman argued that Merrill was mislabeling deals
that belonged in the mortgage-backed category. Merrill fired back that
Lehman had a habit of conjuring up 11th-hour deals by buying up securities
in the open market and repackaging them as new asset-backed issues.</p>
<p>In fact, Lehman pulled off Tuesday just the sort of last-minute maneuver
Merrill feared: It announced the sale of $2.08 billion of repackaged bonds
backed by credit-card debt. That deal pushed Lehman past Merrill into first
place in underwriting asset-backed securities of every imaginable stripe,
with total sales of $24.48 billion, or 15.9% of the market, according to
Securities Data. Merrill wound up with sales of $23.26 billion, or
15.1%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Playing Referee</b></p>
<p>Despite its best efforts to achieve consensus on what is and isn't an
asset-backed security, Securities Data decided not to decide. To appease
Merrill after Lehman's maneuver, Securities Data also published a ranking
of underwriters of securities that indisputably qualified as asset-backed.
Of course, in that ranking, Merrill was No. 1 with 16% market share, well
ahead of Lehman with 12.5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Lerch refused to try to determine a firm's motivation for doing a
deal. Over the years, "every firm on the Street has accused every other
firm of doing a deal only for league-table credit," says Mr. Lerch, who has
played the role of referee in similarly contentious meetings to hash out
how to measure the markets for other securities that defy easy
categorization.</p>
<p>Wall Street's propensity to invent and reinvent products is one of the
main factors at work in the asset-backed market. The market grew out of
banks' need to pass along the risks they were taking on by lending to
customers.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Securitizing Home Mortgages</b></p>
<p>In the 1970s, banks started securitizing pools of home mortgages,
pooling loans from around the country to reduce the chances that a downturn
in one region's economy would lead to a default. The success of
mortgage-backed securities led the financial engineers on Wall Street to
experiment with shorter-term loans, such as car and student loans and
credit-card borrowings.</p>
<p>Today, bankers say that just about any predictable stream of revenues
can be securitized and sold in pieces to investors. Lehman Brothers, one of
the more creative underwriters, has put together bond deals backed by
everything from royalty payments on oil in South American wells to loans to
Taco Bell restaurant franchisees.</p>
<p>William Lighten, co-head of asset-backed finance at Lehman, says there
are more than 50 types of assets underlying bonds outstanding. The market,
he adds, gives smaller companies better access to the capital they need to
grow, and gives investors opportunities to buy highly rated securities that
offer higher yields than Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the fastest-growing U.S. companies in recent years has
been Green Tree Financial Corp., which finances manufactured-home purchases
and has been one of the biggest issuers of asset-backed securities. Wall
Street firms reaped more than $30 million in fees from underwriting Green
Tree offerings in 1996.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Sliding Rates Fuel Stock Gains</h2>

<p>Call it the Euro effect: As Europe's single-currency plan gained
political momentum throughout the year, the yield premium on Belgian
government bonds against German bunds nearly vanished. The fall in interest
rates helped propel Belgian equities to records.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Bel-20 Index rose 21.5% to 1895.49. Smaller stocks helped lift the
market. Also boosting the market was the reappraisal of several companies
such as chemicals maker UCB SA, whose shares nearly doubled in value during
the year, or car-distribution and leasing company D'Ieteren, whose shares
rose more than 100%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">U.K. Gains Lag Other Markets</h2>

<p>British stocks were a bit of bummer in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Weighed down by political worries, a strong currency, a small
interest-rate increase and being out of the European Monetary Union,
British stocks lagged behind much of Europe. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index climbed only 11.6% to 4118.5.</p>
<p>The trend toward higher interest rates in the United Kingdom is one of
the major reasons British stocks didn't enjoy as strong a performance as
some other markets in 1996. In the fourth quarter, U.K. regulators raised
base rates by a quarter percentage point to 6%, and analysts estimate that
there will be another quarter-point rate rise in the first quarter of
1997.</p>
<p>"Britain is the only country that raised interest rates in 1996," says
Robert Buckland, a U.K. strategist at HSBC James Capel in London. "The U.K.
economy is growing twice as fast as many other economies and we are also
looking at U.K. rates going up in the New Year." Indeed, throughout 1996
other European countries continued to lower their base rates.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Markets May Suffer Downturn</h2>

<p>Scandinavian stock markets sizzled during 1996, but analysts caution
that prospects this year look less spectacular, with Stockholm, Helsinki,
Finland and Oslo likely to be drawn into a world-wide correction of
sky-high stock valuations.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Helsinki's HEX general index has surged 52% to 2595.9%, the best
performing bourse in Europe. Stockholm's Affarsvarlden Index was up 38% to
2402.94. Stockholm and Oslo's All-Share Index was up 32% to 968.37 during
the same period.</p>
<p>In the coming year, analysts see scant prospects for a repeat of the
plunge in interest rates that spurred big institutional investors to shift
from bonds into equities.</p>
<p>The Danish KFX share index pushed 29.9, or 28%, higher to end 1996 at
136.13, helped by Denmark's continued low-inflation growth and underpinned
by solid earnings among blue chips and banks.</p>
<p>Analysts say Copenhagen should continue to match gains by neighboring
equities markets in early 1997, though the country's opt-out from European
economic and monetary union could start weighing on shares in the longer
term.</p>

<p>The French stock market was slower than most to respond to the
high-octane mix of lower interest rates and corporate restructuring that
propelled other European markets higher through 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>However, after an erratic start to the year, when the main French CAC-40
Index lurched forward some 10% before falling back to its starting point,
the market really took off in late summer. Since then it has climbed
strongly, ending the year 24% higher at 2315.73, close to its all-time high
of 2360.98, reached on Feb. 2, 1994.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Post Solid Returns</h2>

<p>German stocks were among the best-performing shares in Europe in
1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The DAX Index, the key gauge of 30 stocks traded at the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, rose 28.2% to 2888.7 in 1996. But analysts caution that 1997 is
likely to have more moderate gains.</p>
<p>The DAX started the year with a bang, climbing nearly 2% on the first
day of trading, and moved gradually higher. It hit a string of all-time
highs, peaking at 2910 Dec. 5. The main reasons for Germany's banner year
were positive earnings expectations for most of Germany's industrial sector
(sparked in part by a weakening mark and signs of a late-year pickup in
growth), falling interest rates, corporate-restructuring plans and an
increased focus on shareholder value. German shares also received a big
boost from Wall Street's highflying performance.</p>
<p>Hot sectors were chemicals and autos, both of which are extremely
sensitive to the dollar's gyrations. The big loser was electronics,
particularly after both SAP AG and Siemens AG issued warnings of earnings
disappointments late in the year. Commerzbank is recommending cyclical
shares such as steel and energy as well as electronics in 1997.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom shared the spotlight with Europe's largest-ever initial
public offering. But without such a megaoffering in 1997, new issuance is
expected to slow dramatically.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Strong Economy Drives Market</h2>

<p>While the rest of Europe might be in the midst of trying to pick up its
economic growth, Ireland is enjoying a strong economy. New jobs created by
U.S. companies settling in Ireland, low interest rates and low inflation
are fueling the growth.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Irish stock market performed better than many other European
markets, with the ISEQ Index of 64 shares traded in Dublin soaring 23% to
2725.63.</p>
<p>Domestic stocks were among the best performers on the Dublin exchange.
Shares of two major banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, make up
about one-third of the index. Another stock that performed well is CRH PLC,
a manufacturer of building materials that benefited from the economic
growth.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Market Stays Near 1995 Level</h2>

<p>The Italian stock market was among the worst performers in Europe, with
all its indexes swinging around the same levels as the end of 1995. The
Milan stock exchange BCI Index rose 13% to 666.4.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>And for 1997, the mood isn't bullish among analysts. Slow economic
growth and uncertainty last spring around election time weighed heavily on
the stock market. Also the reinforcement of the lira penalized corporate
earnings.</p>
<p>However, the stock market moved ahead thanks to a quick fall in the
inflation rate and consequent drop in interest rates as well as more
political stability in the second half of the year.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Dutch Market: Star Performer</h2>

<p>The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was one of the star performers among
European bourses, with the AEX Index surging 33.6% to 648.24.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Banking and insurance stocks played a big role in the rise, as they
account for more than a quarter of the index's weighting. But the overall
market was also helped by a reappraisal of Dutch equities, which have all
but lost their traditional discount against other European bourses.</p>

the Madrid General Index rose 39% to 444.77. With Spanish price-earnings
ratios low in comparison with other European markets, analysts say there's
still room for prices to rise a further 10% this year.</p>

<p>Corporate restructuring bolstered the Swiss stock market in 1996 and
rapid corporate change is expected to continue in 1997, contributing to
further market gains in the next 12 months.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The surprise announcement in March by Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG that
they would merge to form Novartis AG, the world's second-largest

two companies shot up, helping to boost the Swiss Market Index of blue-chip
stocks 20% to 3942.2.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Argentina's Policy Mirrors Fed</h2>

<p>Argentina's innovative convertibility system links the Argentine peso
one-to-one to the U.S. dollar and mandates that money supply not exceed
hard-currency reserves, leaving Argentine economic policy to be largely
determined by the Federal Reserve Board in the U.S.</p>

States," says Tim Love, head of emerging-markets strategy and research at
ING-Baring Securities Ltd. in London. "That's been very positive," he says,
in 1996, when the market has risen about 25%, in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Mr. Love is girding for a possible correction during the first half of
1997. But he expects the market to grow stronger as the year progresses,
with a total gain exceeding 20%, according to his preliminary
estimates.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Brazil Focuses on Politics</h2>

<p>As usual, market activity in Brazil will be dominated by the political
calendar. During the first quarter of 1997, the fractious Brazilian
Congress is expected to decide whether to approve a constitutional change
allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election when
his term ends at the end of next year.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The market is counting heavily on Mr. Cardoso getting the chance for a
reprise. He is the architect of the Real Plan, which has lowered chronic
Brazilian inflation to 1% a month from 50% a month in 1994. The market
ended more than 50% higher in 1996.</p>
<p>If re-election is approved, as expected, it would strengthen Mr.
Cardoso's hand to approve some badly needed constitutional measures
designed to rein in the Brazilian budget.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Rate Cuts Stimulate Economy</h2>

<p>Canadian equity markets took off like a shot in 1996, aided by interest
rates that declined faster than a falling safe.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Bank of Canada cut rates 19 times between May 1995 and December
1996, responding to lower rates in the U.S. and seeking to stimulate the
Canadian economy. In December, three-month Treasury bills in Canada were
yielding 2.89%, compared with 4.97% in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition, federal and many provincial governments lowered deficits,
and Quebec separatism was put on the back burner after a referendum in
October 1995 narrowly defeated secession.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-stock index ended 1996 at 5927.03, up
25.7% from its 1995 close of 4713.54. Canadian bank stocks were the
standout performers, followed by conglomerates and energy companies. The
oil and gas sector benefited from higher crude prices.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Political Crisis Roils Market</h2>

<p>A political crisis continues to wrack Colombia's economy and stock
markets, which were among the worst performing in Latin America last year.
Most analysts are looking for a modest bounce back in the Colombian economy
and modest returns of around 10% to 12% this year as the crisis starts to
fade, but not completely disappear.</p>

resignation because of allegations that he knowingly received money from
drug traffickers during his election campaign in 1994. Most analysts
believe Mr. Samper will be able to finish his term, which ends in 1998.</p>

year investors could feel satisfied with.</p>

ending with a rally that pushed the benchmark over the 3360 mark -- up 21%
in pesos and 17% in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Conglomerates made a strong comeback, although most Mexican share prices
still lag behind 1994 predevaluation highs in dollar terms. Shares of Grupo
Carso, a conglomerate with vast holdings that span just about every
important sector of the economy, more than doubled  in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Shares of Grupo Desc, a leading exporter of auto parts, ended 1996 up
more than 75%; shares of steel-pipe fabricator Tubos de Acero Mexico,
another export power, were up more than twofold.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Fujimori Struggles With Crises</h2>

<p>Peru was another slow market in Latin America in 1996. It was a year
marked by one crisis after another, all of which seemed to damage President
Alberto Fujimori.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Mr. Fujimori's popularity among Peruvians is key to economic and
stock-market success in Peru. He is credited with bringing Peru back from
the precipice of economic, social and political chaos when he took office
in 1990.</p>
<p>The crises, including the December hostage drama and a slowdown in
economic growth from the start of the year, have sharply cut his popular
support from 75% in 1995 to less than 50% at the end of 1996. By the fall
of last year, economic growth had slowed to the low single digits after two
years of double-digit expansion.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Venezuela Bounces Back</h2>

<p>Venezuela went from basket case to favored nation on the lists of many
investors last year because of the start of a program of modest economic
changes. Its stock market more than doubled last year -- the best in Latin
America, and in dollar terms, one of the top performers in the world.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Analysts expect 1997 to be a good one for Venezuelan stocks as long as
the economic program stays on track, but don't expect a repeat of last
year's eye-popping returns. Something along the lines of 20% returns, in
dollars, is more likely, says Tim Love, head of emerging-markets strategy
and research at ING-Baring Securities Ltd. in London.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Investors in Asia Weigh<br>
Where to Invest in 1997</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>The key question for many investors in Asia this year is whether to
stick with the region's stellar performers -- such as Hong Kong, where the
Hang Seng Index leaped 34% in 1996 -- or to switch to some of the laggards,
such as South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"If you don't make the right decisions on which markets to invest in,
your stock decisions will be insignificant," warns Michael Unsworth,
regional head of research at Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific).</p>
<p>As they weigh those decisions, many strategists and fund managers are
still tempted by Hong Kong.</p>
<p>For Hisao Otera, director and general manager of Tokio Marine Investment
Services in Hong Kong, the colony remains the core of his Asian portfolio.
But his exposure won't be quite so large as in 1996, when he parked about
60% of his funds in Hong Kong. That will be moderated to about 50% for the
first half of 1997, he says.</p>
<p>Although the Hong Kong market could suffer a short-term correction, Mr.
Otera is confident that the territory's July 1 handover to China will be
positive for stocks. He thinks the market is likely to be swept up in a
celebratory rally. But many stocks are no longer cheap and earnings growth
in the territory isn't as compelling as before, so Tokio Marine will be
poised to trim its holdings during the second half, he says.</p>
<p>Tokio Marine will have a neutral weighting of 15% to 20% in Malaysia and
15% in Singapore. The rest will be sprinkled throughout the region. Of the
markets that suffered the worst declines in 1996, Mr. Otera reckons that
Thailand has the best chance of rebounding during the coming year, and may
attract more of his funds as the year progresses. The structural problems
of South Korea show fewer signs of a quick turnaround, he argues.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Otera says Tokio Marine will continue to favor the most
liquid markets in the region, while generally avoiding markets where it is
difficult to enter or exit quickly.</p>
<p>Pauline Gately, regional strategist for Asia excluding Japan at Merrill
Lynch (Asia Pacific) in Hong Kong, is another big fan of the Hong Kong
stock market. Overall, she recommends an overweight position in the
Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) for global investors because she
reckons that declining U.S. bond yields in the first half will spark
greater international interest in the region's equity markets.</p>
<p>Her favorite markets are last year's star performer Hong Kong and two of
the region's laggards -- South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p>Despite its huge gain in 1996, Hong Kong will continue to be "one of the
biggest regional beneficiaries of positive U.S. interest-rate trends," she
says, thanks to the Hong Kong dollar's link to the U.S. greenback. Hong
Kong also stands to benefit from China's faster growth. Meanwhile, she
says, the Hang Seng Index's prospective P/E ratio of around 14 is well
below the high of 20 that the market hit in January 1994. Fair value for
the Hang Seng would be around 15400, with a potential for rising to 16500,
she believes. That compares with 13451.45 at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Thailand, where the SET Index fell 35% last year, deserves a weighting
of 9% compared with a neutral weighting of 7%, Ms. Gately says. "We view
Thailand as a strong contender in the second-half regional-performance
stakes," she says. What might help to inspire the market? In her view, the
possible catalysts include a shrinkage of the current-account deficit, an
easing of monetary policy, and relatively low P/E ratios, except for the
financial sector.</p>
<p>South Korea, where the Composite Index dropped 26% last year, deserves
an overweight position of 8%, versus 7%, given that its stock-market cycle
is "heavily influenced by global economic conditions," she says. The
prospect of a stronger global economy will translate into export growth, an
improving current account, and higher earnings, she adds.</p>
<p>Ms. Gately suggests that investors adopt neutral weightings for both
Malaysia and Taiwan because of concerns "that the liquidity-driven rallies
in those two countries risk running out of steam in the absence of a strong
earnings kicker."</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Indonesia are the two Asian markets that should be
over-represented in a portfolio, says Ian Burden, chief investment officer
for the Asia-Pacific region at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, he says, the evidence has increased that China
and Hong Kong are at the start of a new business cycle. He has about 37% of
his portfolio in Hong Kong (which also gives him exposure to China) and he
sees the credit easing in China and the renewed strength of the Hong Kong
property market boosting Hong Kong stocks.</p>
<p>Despite the political risks associated with Indonesia, Mr. Burden
recommends going overweight in this market because of its buoyant economy,
the prospect of falling interest rates, and continued strong earnings
growth.</p>
<p>His funds are neutral on Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, but he
adds that Thailand has fallen to levels that look "tempting." Meanwhile,
he's underweight in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p>For the next six months, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the
Philippines are the top markets, in that order, for Robert Howe, chief
executive officer at Geomatrix (H.K.).</p>
<p>He says Malaysia has some of the region's best improvements in profit
expectations for 1997, and while the market's P/E ratio of 18 times 1997
earnings isn't very low, "it is reasonable for Malaysia historically, and
it is reasonable given the good profit growth."</p>
<p>Mr. Howe adds that for Hong Kong, profit expectations fell slightly in
October and November, but the market overall isn't too expensive, apart
from some of the leading blue chips.</p>
<p>"The conspiracy theory rules for the Hong Kong market in 1997," he says.
"Beijing wants a bull market to convince the world and especially Taiwan
that the marriage will be prosperous and Hong Kong's dowry is safe."</p>
<p>Mr. Howe likes Indonesia because he thinks it is cheap at 14 times
forecast 1997 earnings per share. He has recently added the Philippines to
his buy list because the property stocks have slipped back to reasonable
levels. In addition, the economic and corporate-profit cycles haven't
reached their peak yet and the market is still moderately priced at 15
times forecast 1997 earnings per share, he says.</p>
<p>"We might put a little money into the Indian subcontinent, purely on
valuation grounds," Mr. Howe adds. "But profit-growth expectations for 1997
are deteriorating, so those low P/E ratios are suspect."</p>
<p>Three markets to short are, in order, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan, given
that "all three show very bad deterioration in profit expectations," he
says. He notes that Thailand is the most controversial call -- many
supposedly savvy regional investors are rushing to buy value in Thailand,
he says. But until the profit collapse slows there, "you don't know what
the value is you are buying . . . The property and banking downward spiral
could well continue."</p>
<p>He believes that investors who buy last year's worst Asian market in the
expectation that it will be this year's best market have no precedent on
their side.</p>
<p>Marc Faber, managing director of fund-management firm Marc Faber Ltd. in
Hong Kong, suggests that for 1997 investors take their profits in the U.S.
and move them to some of last year's losers, focusing on funds that invest
in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p>For "super-bears" such as himself, who believe that the end is nigh for
the U.S. bull market, this year's strategy will focus on short-selling U.S.
stocks with high price-earnings ratios. (Short-selling is a bearish bet in
which the investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing
them with cheaper ones later.)</p>
<p>Mr. Faber singles out shares in the software and
telecommunication-equipment industries, "where increased capacity and rapid
technological changes will bring cut-throat competition and disappointing
earnings growth."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Analysts Puzzle Over Economy<br>
As They Gauge Tokyo Market</h2>

<p><b>By R<font size="-1">OBERT</font> S<font size="-1">TEINER</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Normally, Haruyoshi Mabuchi feels comfortable forecasting the way Tokyo
stocks will start a new year based on how they ended the old one. But this
year the strategist at Nikko Research Center Ltd. is having problems. "Many
institutional investors in Japan are neither bullish nor bearish," he
complains. "They say they don't know."</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The problem is that investors are torn between relief that Japan's
economy is growing steadily -- albeit still slowly -- after a five-year
slump, and fear that Japan's government could end that growth by cutting
back on economic stimulus. In April the government is to raise Japan's
consumption tax and end a cut in income taxes that has been in place for
two years. Analysts also expect it to spend only one trillion yen ($8.62
billion) on public works and other measures outside of the normal budget,
compared with 11 trillion yen of spending and tax cuts last year.</p>
<p>Japan's investors are so skeptical about the economy's health that they
pushed stock prices down to close 1996 below where the year began, even
though corporate earnings are rising and Japan's financial system is making
strides toward clearing its mountains of bad debt. The Nikkei 225 average
of blue chip stocks ended at 19361.35, 2.6% below 1995's finish.</p>
<p>Of course, 1996 was far more turbulent than its opening and closing
numbers suggest. The Nikkei soared 14% to 22666.80 in the first six months,
as foreign investors jumped into a market that they figured had more
potential to keep rising than Wall Street. Japan's institutional investors
also added to their stock portfolios, largely because interest rates were
far too low to provide decent returns in bonds. Japan's business conditions
were improving too: Record-low interest rates allowed banks to borrow money
cheaply, raise their profits and thus write down bad loans more easily.
What's more, the yen, whose strength had so ravaged Japan's economy in
early 1995, was sliding slowly. A weak yen helps Japanese exporters sell
their products at competitive prices overseas.</p>
<p>Then, in the second half, Tokyo stocks got whacked. Many foreigners
figured they had put enough into Japan and turned their attention back to
the U.S. market, which was still soaring. Japanese investors began worrying
about what is now their obsession: the government getting tight with its
cash.</p>
<p>Now "there is really no doubt that the decline in fiscal stimulus will
be a drag on growth (in 1997)," says John Rogers, president of Invesco
Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. The Finance Ministry is serious about cutting
Japan's rising central-government debt, which some economists calculate at
77% of gross domestic product. As the government slows its spending,
though, "the only real stimulus is very low interest rates," says Clifford
Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd.</p>
<p>But there are other signs of good economic news to cheer on stocks in
1997. Japanese companies are benefiting from low interest rates and from a
government that's pushing deregulation more forcefully than its recent
predecessors. Exports are rising, and many analysts expect them to get a
further boost if the yen remains at current levels. And Japan's economy
could get a hand from "a re-acceleration of U.S. growth" that should draw
in more Japanese exports in the second half of 1997, says Cameron Umetsu, a
Tokyo economist at UBS Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>The net result is likely to be GDP growth of around 2% in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1998, compared with between 2.5% and 3% growth in the
current fiscal year, analysts say. "The story will be that companies are
underestimating their profits," says Paul Sheard, an investment strategist
at Baring Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. Profits will rise strongly during
1997 as Japanese companies boost their output to levels that match Japan's
industrial capacity, he says. Mr. Sheard thus expects the Nikkei 225 to
rise to between 23000 and 23500 by year end.</p>
<p>In fact, because stock prices have been falling while earnings
expectations are rising, Japanese shares stand at "better than fair value,"
Mr. Rogers says. "The Japanese market is back to a level where foreigners
want to have a good look." Still, he expects the Nikkei to spend a few more
months stuck below 22000. Mr. Mabuchi, at Nikko, figures it could slip to
18000 this month.</p>
<p>Japanese interest rates, meanwhile, may head back up a bit, Mr. Umetsu
says -- though not enough to crimp the economy. The benchmark 10-year
Japanese government bond will probably yield "over 3.5% in next nine to 12
months," he figures. It ended 1996 at a yield of about 2.57%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Analysts Say Index Will Rise,<br>
Supported by Banks, Economy</h2>

<p>The Australian stock market appears to be headed higher, but market
watchers say investors could get a nasty jolt or two along the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Peter Morgan, Australian equities manager at Perpetual Funds Management,
thinks a dip on Wall Street in the first quarter of the year "will cause
some volatility in Australia." But he's forecasting that the All Ordinaries
Index, a main indicator, will reach 2580 by year's end. The All Ordinaries
ended 1996 at 2424.6.</p>
<p>Underlying Mr. Morgan's bullishness are banks, whose handsome dividend
yields he thinks will lure investors. Currently, he says, major banks are
trading at nine or 10 times estimated fiscal 1997 earnings, a hefty
discount to a basket of nonresources Australian stocks.</p>
<p>He also thinks there are some positive earnings surprises in store at
other companies. For instance, he says companies whose profits were hit
hard last year, such as building-materials concerns "are showing signs of
turning around."</p>
<p>Resources stocks also are likely to prop up the overall market. But the
property-trust sector, he says, is likely to be "flat to down," hurt partly
by rising interest rates during 1997.</p>
<p>After a "challenging year" in 1996, Helmut Engelhard, an analyst at
Hartley Poynton Ltd., is bracing for a year that "won't be outrageously
good." The prices of minerals that Australia exports have been
"disappointing in the past year," he adds. And while there are signs that
world demand is accelerating, he says, "any real gains won't come before
1998."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Engelhard thinks the All Ordinaries Index is likely to
climb 10% to 12% to around 2700 by the end of the year, underpinned by an
economy growing around 3% to 3.5% and a "fairly benign" interest-rate
environment. Moreover, he figures that with inflation set to remain low,
investors will favor the stock market with its annual pretax yield of 5.5%
to 6% over government 10-year bonds, which are likely to yield around
7.5%.</p>
<p>He likes Wesfarmers Ltd., a chemical maker and provider of agricultural
services, and G.E. Crane Holdings Ltd., a building-materials maker that
will benefit from an expected recovery in the housing industry.</p>
<p>Russell Skirrow, research director at ABN Amro Australia Hoare Govett
(Securities) Ltd., is less confident. He thinks the All Ordinaries might
edge up to around 2450 by the end of 1997. "Our expectations for the market
as a whole are fairly subdued," he says. In September, he forecast that
companies other than resources firms and banks would post average profit
increases in fiscal 1997 of about 10%. He recently slashed that forecast by
half. Given the weak corporate-profit outlook, he adds, the Australian
market isn't likely to exceed the growth of other Asian markets, which
might discourage international investors.</p>
<p>Last year "was more a year of disappointments" than anything else, as a
slower economy triggered earnings downgrades from some of the country's
biggest companies, Perpetual's Mr. Morgan says. The All Ordinaries climbed
10% in 1996.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Barring Regulatory Confusion,<br>
Markets Will Continue to Gain</h2>

<p>In 1996, China's stock markets recovered, in a turbulent way, from the
doldrums of a long government-imposed austerity campaign. A loosening of
monetary policy and the advent of large-scale involvement by individual
investors bodes well for the market in 1997. Only regulatory confusion
stands in the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges both turned in strong
performances for the year. Much of that was due to interest-rate cuts by
the country's monetary authorities, who were opening the credit spigots
after a three-year austerity campaign aimed at curbing inflation. With
inflation now well below 10%, on an annualized basis, and deposit rates at
banks sliding, investors have returned to the stock markets.</p>
<p>"All the elements are in place for a sustained recovery in the market,"
says Bruce Richardson, chief representative in Shanghai for HG Asia. "And
investors are showing increasing maturity."</p>
<p>With more than 21 million retail investors now connected to the
exchanges by tens of thousands of computer terminals around the country,
that's been a vital boost. Individual investors drove indices sharply
higher before December, then the market hit a major crisis.</p>
<p>Prices for A shares -- available only to domestic investors in yuan --
surged far ahead of prices for B shares, which are earmarked for foreigners
in foreign currency. Foreign interest in China's still-thin markets remains
limited. But domestic investors saw the widening gap as an arbitrage
opportunity and began buying B shares, aided by local brokerage firms that
relaxed the rules. In December the market took off -- doubling in a bit
more than a week.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the speculation, China's regulators warned that the market
was rising too fast -- sparking a sudden selloff. Some investors feared a
crackdown on illegal B-share buying might be in store. Trying to control
the volatility, regulators imposed a 10% limit on daily price movements of
shares. The result: two days of both the Shenzhen and Shanghai markets
dropping 10%, and angry investors demanding the government step out of the
way.</p>
<p>That sets the scene for 1997, analysts say. The government has said it
wants to raise 10 billion yuan in new share issues, up from only 5.5
billion in 1996. But it must have investors' confidence to absorb that
amount. "I don't think the Chinese government will do anything too
aggressive" to further interfere with stock trading, says Fanton Chuck,
head of China research at Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities (HK) Ltd.</p>
<p>With economic growth in the coming year expected to top 10%, slightly
above estimates of about 9% growth for 1996, the macroeconomic situation
favors the market. Economists even expect another interest-rate cut early
next year. So sure are some regulators, in fact, that they are talking
about supplementing the handful of nationwide mutual funds that now exist
with a broad, retail mutual-fund industry. In order for those plans to
succeed, they will need to stay out of investors' way.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Return to Chinese Rule in July<br>
Could Fuel Stock Market Rise</h2>

<p>The future is red, and that's being taken as good news for Hong Kong's
stock market.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Local and international investors are bullish that China's takeover of
Hong Kong will help propel the Hang Seng Index to new heights.</p>
<p>The index soared 34% last year, thanks to rebounding property prices and
improved sentiment regarding Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
Barring any major gaffes by Beijing as it works for a smooth transition to
Chinese rule in Hong Kong, some analysts expect 1997 to be almost as good
as 1996.</p>
<p>"After the handover, China will support the [Hong Kong] economy," says
Percy Au-Young, research director of DBS Securities Hong Kong Ltd. "They
will increase the number of Chinese companies coming to Hong Kong and
capital flows." He reflects the view of many locals that Beijing wants to
make its rule a success by helping to pump up the colony's two most closely
watched indicators of economic well-being -- the stock market and property
prices. The analyst predicts that the Hang Seng index will reach 15000 to
15500 by the end of the year, up from 13451.45 at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Janice Wallace, head of Hong Kong research at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC,
predicts that the index will hit 15800 by year-end. Ms. Wallace expects
strong inflows of cash from China as Beijing eases its tight credit
controls to buoy the market. She estimates that mainland buyers accounted
for one quarter of the HK$29 billion (US$3.75 billion) in office and
residential property purchases in the first nine months of 1996.</p>
<p>Aside from positive sentiment, two other factors likely to drive the
market next year are China's gradually improving economy and low U.S.
interest rates.</p>
<p>Beijing's gradual easing of its tight monetary policy is giving a lift
to Hong Kong's economy. Mr. Au-Young of DBS predicts that the territory's
gross domestic product will expand 5.3% in 1997, up from about 4.7% last
year, reversing a trend of more than four years of slowing GDP growth.</p>
<p>U.S. interest will also drive the market because interest rates in the
colony track those in the U.S. Most analysts expect that U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will hold rates low.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Political and Economic Woes<br>
Have Local Investors Sidelined</h2>

<p>After a disappointing year for Indian stocks, fund managers and analysts
still see reason for caution.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>They expect that a resurgent Congress Party under a new leader will
demand a greater say in the country's government at some stage in 1997.
That's likely to mean an unsettled political climate. Adding to the anxiety
are concerns about a widening government budget deficit, higher prices for
petroleum products and slower corporate earnings growth.</p>
<p>"The market hasn't factored in the grim realities of the political and
economic front," says Praween Napate, a director and head of broking at ING
Baring Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. in Bombay. "The bear phase has still
not run its full course."</p>
<p>After hitting a 1996 high of 4069.26 points on June 18, the Bombay
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, went into a swoon. Investors were upset by a
new tax on companies and rising petroleum-product prices. The benchmark
index fell to a year low of 2745.06 on Dec. 4, then recovered to end 1996
at 3085.20 on Dec. 24, down 1.4% on the year.</p>
<p>"The Sensex may rise by about 500 to 700 points at some point of time
but the question is whether it can be sustained," says Samir Arora, chief
investment officer of Alliance Capital Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd.
in Bombay.</p>
<p>Many local investors remain wary of the stock market after suffering
heavy losses in recent years. But foreign institutional investors will
increase their weightings in Indian stocks in 1997, predicts Barry Hall,
president of Morgan Stanley India in Bombay. He thinks investors will look
for bargains in India partly because U.S. and European stocks "have moved
up so much."</p>
<p>Some fund managers say stock prices could rise in the first quarter on
expectations of market-friendly policies in the government's upcoming
budget for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998. In addition, the two main
stock exchanges are creating share-depository facilities that will make it
easier for investors to buy and sell shares without physically transferring
share certificates, which has created a nightmare of paperwork in the
past.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Uncertainty Ahead of Elections<br>
May Cap Market's Advance</h2>

<p>If economic indicators were all that counted, Indonesia's stock market
would be set to sail at a good clip this year. But the pace may be held
back a notch by politics as the country enters a two-year period of
elections amid the ever-present uncertainty over who will follow President
Suharto.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Economists predict that the economy will match or beat 1996's growth of
about 7.5%. Inflation may slow and interest rates should fall slightly,
improving the prospects for companies to boost earnings. "From a top-down
approach, looking at the economy, everything looks good," says Rizal
Prasetijo, strategist for PT Jardine Fleming Nusantara.</p>
<p>But he and many other analysts expect a sluggish first half for the
market as investors keep an eye on May 29 parliamentary elections. The
winner isn't in doubt -- Mr. Suharto's Golkar is assured of victory -- but
Indonesian elections traditionally make businesspeople a bit fearful that
tensions could flare up.</p>
<p>Moreover, this election comes only 10 days before Mr. Suharto turns 76.
His wife's unexpected death last April and a July trip he made to Germany
for medical checks reminded Indonesians of his mortality -- and of the
issue of political succession. Assuming his health remains good, Mr.
Suharto is virtually certain to take a seventh five-year term when a
special 1,000-member assembly meets in March 1998, but it's an open
question who will be the next vice president, and possible successor.</p>
<p>Mr. Prasetijo predicts a second-half rally that leaves the Jakarta
Composite Index at between 700 and 725 by year end, up from 637.43 at the
end of 1996. Tom Inglis, head of research at PT ING Baring Securities
Indonesia, is more bullish, seeing the index at 750 at year end, though he
adds that 1997 "won't be without its pitfalls."</p>
<p>In 1996, the market's solid early-year rally began to fizzle in May. The
government-backed ouster of Megawati Sukarnoputri as head of a small party
and the consequent July 27 riot helped push down share prices. Smart
investors, as it turns out, bought depressed shares soon after the riot.
Boosting the market in the fourth quarter was the popularly priced initial
public offering by PT Bank Negara Indonesia. For 1996 as a whole, the index
climbed 24%.</p>
<p>This year, investors hope for more offerings by state companies and
fewer political jolts. Frans van der Horst, research director of PT
Schroders Indonesia, says there is "no reason to expect the market to
perform badly." But, he adds, he is "not fully comfortable yet" with the
political situation.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Market Could Revisit 1994 Highs<br>
As Sizzling Economy Eases a Bit</h2>

<p>Malaysia's stock market is expected this year to test the super bull-run
levels of 1993 and early 1994 as foreign investors finally are convinced
that the sizzling economy is easing to a less-breathtaking pace.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>With projections for corporate-earnings growth averaging about 15% and
signs of renewed interest from overseas funds, analysts say 1997 looks
rosier after a sluggish 1995 for the market and the start of a recovery in
1996.</p>
<p>"We think there could be a retest of the all-time high of 1332 seen in
January 1994," says Patrick Zecha, head of research at South Johor
Securities Sdn. Bhd., referring to the Composite Index, which tracks 100
blue chip stocks.</p>
<p>Others agree. "The general upward trend is still intact," says a senior
analyst with a local brokerage. He sees the main index flirting with record
levels as early as next month.</p>
<p>With buoyant growth in earnings expected, the market should be able to
rise without the dizzying price/earnings ratios -- averaging 30 -- seen in
the last bull market. Even if the Composite Index rises above 1300 this
year, average P/E ratios should remain realistic, in the low 20s, Mr. Zecha
said.</p>
<p>The index ended 1996 with a gain of 24%, performing much better than in
1995, when it edged up just 2.5% amid fears of an overheating economy that
would boost inflation and widen the current account deficit. Then local
bargain hunters soon moved in and the market started moving up in the first
quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Monthly economic figures, which indicated that Malaysia's large current
account deficit was narrowing, helped fuel the recovery. In October, the
government forecast that economic growth would slow to 8.2% in 1996 and 8%
in 1997 after a record 9.5% in 1995, further strengthening the market as
investor fears of overheating subsided.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Are Likely to Be Buoyed<br>
By Economic Growth in 1997</h2>

<p>The prospect of lower interest rates coupled with faster economic growth
is likely to buoy the New Zealand stock market this year, analysts and fund
managers say.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"We're reasonably optimistic" that the stock market is in for a
"relatively broad-based" boost, says Greg Whitten, managing director of
fund manager Prudential Portfolio Management New Zealand Ltd.</p>
<p>He thinks the economy is set to expand by about 3% this year, up from
1.25% in 1996. That is likely to send the NZSE-40 Capital Index 10% to 15%
higher in 1997, he adds. The index advanced 9.8% in 1996.</p>
<p>A brighter economic outlook is going to put a particular shine on
consumer-oriented stocks, Mr. Whitten says. Among his picks is retailing
concern Hallenstein Glasson Holdings Ltd. Shares in local property
developers, too, will be attractive, he says. Shares in forestry companies,
which have weathered a cyclical downturn, should look better in 1997. He
also likes utilities. "Picking winners is difficult," he adds, but "we'd
want to make sure we had a good exposure" to that sector in 1997.</p>
<p>Raymond Webb, who tracks the market for ANZ McCaughan Securities (NZ)
Ltd., also is looking for the NZSE-40 Capital Index to gain about 10% to
around 2600 by year end.</p>
<p>Driving the market, he says, will be a further decline in domestic
interest rates. Since New Zealanders went to the polls on Oct. 12, yields
on 90-day bank bills have tumbled from around 10% to below 8%. Mr. Webb
thinks they could slip another half percentage point or so during 1997,
helping to underpin the stock market. Likewise, he thinks the New Zealand
dollar is likely to weaken, which would aid New Zealand's exporters.</p>
<p>He expects the economy to expand 2.5% this year. But the overall
outlook, he warns, is "uneven across sectors." For investors, he adds,
"it's going to be a market of stocks rather than a stock market" in the
year ahead.</p>
<p>His choices include Air New Zealand, which is likely to benefit from its
acquisition of 50% of Australia-based international carrier Ansett
Australia, and Guinness Peat Group PLC, an investment company controlled by
New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ronald Brierley. Mr. Webb also thinks Brierley
Investments Ltd., which announced last month that it would acquire up to
25% of John Fairfax Holdings Ltd., Australia's second largest newspaper
publisher, "finally appears to be getting its act together" following a
"very mediocre performance" on the stock market over the past six
years.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nzt&amp;page=15">Telecom Corp. of New Zealand</a>
Ltd., which had a good run in 1996, is also among Mr. Webb's favorites. The
company is "a high-quality" concern offering a pure domestic play on the
New Zealand economy that attracts foreign investors, he says.</p>
<p>Early in 1996, political uncertainty, high short-term interest rates and
a lackluster economic outlook combined to keep a lid on the market. But the
election "marked a change in investor sentiment," Mr. Webb says. The
election left a small populist party, New Zealand First Party, holding the
balance of power. It took New Zealand First two months to decide to rule in
a coalition with the conservative National Party, a partnership that is
supposed to last three years.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Consumer-Related Stocks<br>
May Lead a Rally in 1997</h2>

<p>This will be another good year for the Philippine equities market, some
analysts predict. They say that once again, the market will reward
investors with a 20%-to-25% return, but that consumer-related stocks will
most likely lead the charge this time.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Consumer-related stocks -- mostly food manufacturers -- performed poorly
last year as higher raw-material costs ate into earnings. Blue chip San
Miguel Corp. was the hardest hit because it also had to deal with other
problems such as high financing charges on loans to expand in the
Philippines and elsewhere in Asia, and falling beer consumption. It hit its
lowest point two months ago when the price of its Class B shares --
available to both foreigners and locals -- fell to 70.50 pesos ($2.70)
after the company posted a 19% drop in profit for the first nine months of
the year.</p>
<p>Since late November, San Miguel has gotten a second wind as investors
focused on 1997's considerably better prospects. The B shares finished 1996
at 116 pesos. SBC Warburg Philippines Inc., in a report, predicts a banner
year for the conglomerate in 1998, with profit climbing to 10.1 billion
pesos from 7.1 billion pesos in 1997. For 1996, SBC puts profit at 5.1
billion pesos, down from 1995's 5.8 billion pesos.</p>
<p>With food companies gaining strength, and bank stocks likely to maintain
their solid performance as the economy continues to grow, the Philippine
stock index is expected to hit 3600 points by year end, some analysts say.
That would be a 14% rise from the 1996 close of 3170.56. In 1996, the index
added 22%.</p>
<p>"Food issues will lead the rally," says Conrad Andres, research head at
DBP-Daiwa Securities Inc. "They were the underperformers last year, but
with better sales volume coming in 1997, it will be their turn to grab the
limelight from property issues, which were last year's top performers."</p>
<p>Property companies are still favored, but analysts say investors should
choose outfits involved in low-cost housing, where the demand is still
largely unmet. Companies specializing in office and residential
condominiums are likely to be hit by the anticipated glut in the market,
they add. The once-highflying sector started to lose steam in October when
investors, scared that the bubble was about to burst, unloaded most of
their holdings.</p>
