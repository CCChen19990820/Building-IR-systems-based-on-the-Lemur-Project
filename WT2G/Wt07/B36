Defendants.<P>





CASE NO. 95-5444 RMT (CTX)<P>



COMPLAINT FOR INDUCEMENT TO BREACH CONTRACT, INTENTIONAL

INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT AND PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS

ADVANTAGE; UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND UNFAIR

COMPETITION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMimages<P>



[JURY TRIAL DEMANDED]<P>



Plaintiff brings this action against defendants for

the claims specified below and seeks injunctive relief and

damimages as follows:<P>

<oL>

<B>PARTIES</B><P>



<P><LI>The plaintiff is Interscope Records, Inc., a

California corporation, as the managing general partner of

INTERSCOPE RECORDS, a California general partnership

("Interscope").  has its principal place of business in the

Central District of California, Western Division. Interscope

is a joint venture partnership between Interscope Records,

Inc. and Atlantic Ventures, Inc., a nominal defendant

herein.



<P><LI>Interscope is informed and believes, and based

thereon alleges, that the defendant, C. DeLores Tucker ("),

an individual, resides in and is a citizen of a state other

than California



<P><LI>Interscope names as a nominal defendant, against

which it seeks no relief in this action, Atlantic Ventures,

Inc. ("Atlantic"), a Delaware corporation, headquartered in

the State of New York.<P>



<B>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</B><P>



<P><LI>Jurisdiction exists in this action under the

principle of diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.  1332, in

that the matter in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of

interest and costs; and the Plaintiff and all of the

defendants are citizens of different states.



<P><LI>Venue is properly laid in this District pursuant

to 28 U.S.C.  1392.  Interscope is informed and believes,

and based thereon alleges, that at all relevant times Tucker

engaged in certain wrongful acts alleged below in the

Central District of California, Western Division, and

engaged in other unlawful acts outside this District which

caused injury to Interscope in this District.  Accordingly,

venue properly lies in this District.<P>



<B>GENERAL ALLEGATIONS</B><P>



<P><LI>Interscope is a California general partnership

consisting of Interscope Records, Inc. and Atlantic

Ventures, Inc.  ("Atlantic"), an affiliate of Time Warner

Inc.  ("Time Warner").  Interscope is one of the most

successful record labels in the world.



<P><LI>Interscope has entered into valuable exclusive

contractual arrangements with other record companies which

furnish to Interscope recordings by artists for exclusive

distribution through the Interscope label.  Among such

companies is Death Row Records, Inc. ("Death Row Records"),

with whom Interscope has an exclusive distribution agreement

(the "Death Row Records Contract").



<P><LI>Interscope's exclusive contractual

relationship with Death Row Records, and Time Warner's

involvement in the Interscope partnership, have been widely

publicized, and upon information and belief, are known by

Tucker.



<P><LI>Beginning in mid-1995 and continuing to the

present, Tucker, together with others whose identities are

currently unknown to Interscope, embarked upon and has

continued to engage in a scheme and conspiracy to destroy

Interscope by committing extortion, threats and other

unlawful acts.  Among other things, Tucker has (a) attempted

to induce Death Row Records to breach the Death Row Records

Contract; (b) interfered with Interscope's valuable

relationship with Death Row Records; (c) damaged

Interscope's reputation and credibility in the music

industry; and (d) attempted to induce Atlantic and Time

Warner to breach their fiduciary obligations to Interscope. 

is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that

Tucker has pursued such unlawful acts in order to create a

record distribution company to distribute recordings

produced by Death Row Records and other record companies and

recording artists, for her own personal and financial gain.



<P><LI>Specifically, in or about July or August, 1995,

Tucker attempted to pressure Death Row Records into severing

its relationship with Interscope and appointing Tucker and

her associates as Death Row Records's exclusive

representative to negotiate a production and distribution

agreement directly with Time Warner.  As Tucker well knew,

if Death Row Records proceeded on that course, it would

result in a breach by Death Row Records of the Death Row

Records Contract and a breach by Atlantic and Time Warner of

their fiduciary obligations to Interscope, which would

effectively destroy Interscope.



<P><LI>In order to induce Death Row Records to accede

to her unlawful demands, Tucker engaged in extortion and

other improper conduct in or about July and August of 1995,

including the following:<OL type="a">



<P><LI>In a meeting in Seattle, Washington, attended by

Suge Knight ("Knight"), the Chairman of Death Row Records,

David Kenner ("Kenner"), the attorney for Death Row Records,

and others, Tucker told Knight that she wanted to set up a

record distribution company which she would control, and in

which Knight would have an interest.  She made it clear to

Knight that Death Row Records' willingness to break away

from Interscope was an integral part of her scheme.  Tucker

stated that she had had numerous private conversations about

her plan with Gerald Levin ("Levin"), the Chairman of the

Board of Directors of Time Warner, and Michael Fuchs

("Fuchs"), the Chairman of the Warner Music Group, and that

they were prepared to support Tucker by putting up

"incredible amounts of money." Tucker stated, however, that

Levin and Fuchs would go along with Tucker only if they

believed that Tucker had the ability to control the lyrics

on recordings produced by Death Row Records. Therefore,

Tucker attempted to induce Knight into deceiving Levin and

Fuchs into believing that she could control the lyrics, even

though Knight made it clear to Tucker that he would not

permit such control.  In order to accomplish her deception,

Tucker sought to have Knight agree to a false and fraudulent

press release, and to stand beside Tucker at a press

conference to falsely convey to Levin and Fuchs that she

could control Knight and Death Row Records.



<P><LI>In numerous telephone calls and meetings

thereafter, Tucker and her associates threatened Knight that

if he did not cause Death Row Records to break away from

Interscope, Tucker would use her power and influence, and

would cause Time Warner to use its power and influence, to

get the Government "to go after" Knight and his attorney by

investigating and prosecuting them.  Knight was specifically

threatened that as a result he would spend the rest of his

life in jail.



<P><LI>Furthermore, Tucker and her associates

threatened that if Knight did not cause Death Row Records to

break away from Interscope, Tucker would use her influence

with the press, and Time Warner would use "billions of

dollars to manipulate the press" to destroy Knight and Death

Row Records. Knight was told, "Even something completely

innocent can be made to look terrible."



<P><LI>Tucker told Knight that he could avoid terrible

consequences if he would cooperate with her, that Time

Warner would pay him "an enormous amount of money," and that

Knight would be given an ownership interest in her

contemplated record distribution company, if Knight would

authorize Tucker and her associates to negotiate a deal on

behalf of Death Row Records with Time Warner, which would

"eliminate Interscope."



<P><LI>Subsequently, Tucker claimed that she had spoken

with Fuchs, and that Fuchs was prepared to have Time Warner

pay Knight $80 million, and build two state of the art

recording studios for him, if Knight would cooperate with

Tucker.



<P><LI>Tucker and her associates continued to apply

pressure upon Knight and Death Row Records.  On August 7,

1995, Tucker or her associates told Knight that Fuchs was

flying from New York to Los Angeles that evening "to close

the deal" with Knight.  Tucker delivered to Knight a letter

for Knight's signature, which Tucker had prepared, which

would appoint Tucker and her associates as Death Row

Records' exclusive representative to negotiate an

"acceptable contract relationship with Time Warner regarding

the production and distribution" of Death Row Records'

recordings.



<P><LI>Throughout Wednesday, August 8, 1995, Knight

received numerous telephone messimages from Tucker or her

associates that Fuchs was at Dianne Warwick's home in Los

Angeles waiting to meet with Knight.  As the day progressed,

they told Knight that Fuchs had assured them that if he was

not satisfied with the terms previously proposed to Knight

to eliminate Interscope, Fuchs was willing to be flexible in

the negotiations.  Finally, Knight was told that Fuchs had

been waiting for eight hours to meet with Knight, and had to

get on a plane to fly back to New York, and, therefore,

Knight was urged to immediately meet with Tucker, Fuchs and

others to consummate a deal.



<P><LI>During the evening of August 8, 1995, Knight

received a telephone call from Tucker or her associates

stating that Fuchs was flying back to New York, and wanted

to call Knight from his airplane.</ol>



<P><LI> The foregoing conduct by Tucker and her

associates was unlawful, in bad faith, and in furtherance of

her scheme and conspiracy.<P>



<B>FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B><P>



[Inducing Breach of Contract, Interfering with Contractual

Relations and Prospective Business Advantage]



<P><LI>Interscope realleges and incorporates by

reference Paragraphs 1 through 12, inclusive, as though set

forth at length.



<P><LI>The Death Row Records Contract is a valid and

existing contract between Interscope and Death Row Records.

Interscope is informed and believes, and on that basis

alleges, that Tucker had knowledge of the Death Row Records

Contract and intentionally attempted to induce a breach by

Death Row Records or to disrupt the Death Row Records

Contract through unlawful means.  In so doing, Tucker's

purpose was to damage Interscope's credibility with

recording artists, songwriters, and producers, and to

interfere with Interscope's prospective business advantage,

in order to accomplish her scheme of establishing a record

distribution company which would, among other things,

distribute recordings, produced by Death Row Records.



<P><LI>As a direct result of the actions of Tucker

and her associates, the contractual relationship between

Interscope and Death Row Records has been disrupted, and

Interscope has suffered actual and potential damimages in an

amount as yet unknown.  Interscope shall amend its complaint

to set forth the amount of its damimages when ascertained.



<P><LI>The wrongful acts by Tucker were willful,

wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and were undertaken with

the intent to injure Interscope and to further Tucker's

scheme and conspiracy to establish a record distribution

company for her own profit and gain.  Such conduct therefore

justifies an award of exemplary and punitive damimages in an

amount to be proven at trial<P>



<B>SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B><P>



[Injunctive Relief]<P>



<P><LI>Interscope realleges and incorporates by

reference its allegations in paragraphs 1 through 12,

inclusive, as though set forth at length.



<P><LI>Interscope is informed and believes, and on

that basis alleges, that Tucker, and others acting in

concert with Tucker, intend to continue to cause damage and

injury to Interscope unless enjoined, by, among other

things,  (a) seeking to induce Death Row Records to breach

the Death Row Records Contract,  (b) interfering with the

Death Row Records Contract, and (c) interfering with

Interscope's prospective business advantage.



<P><LI>Interscope has suffered and will continue to

suffer irreparable harm, for which Interscope does not have

an adequate remedy at law, unless Tucker and her associates

are enjoined.



<P><LI>Accordingly, Interscope is entitled to a

preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting

Tucker, and all those acting in concert with Tucker, from

(a) attempting to induce Death Row Records, or any other

party to a contract with Interscope, to breach any existing

contract; (b) interfering with Interscope's existing

contractual relationships; and (c) tortiously interfering

with Interscope's prospective business advantage.<P>



<B>THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B><P>



[Injunctive Relief For Attempting To Induce A Breach of

Fiduciary Duty]<P>



<P><LI>Interscope realleges and incorporates by

reference its allegations in paragraphs 1 through 12,

inclusive, as though set forth at length.



<P><LI>Tucker knowingly, willfully and intentionally,

and through the use of unlawful means, has attempted to

induce Time Warner, and its subsidiary, Atlantic, to breach

their fiduciary obligations to Interscope, and to destroy

the relationship between the partners comprising Interscope.



<P><LI>Interscope is informed and believes, and on that

basis alleges that, unless enjoined, Tucker intends to

continue to attempt to induce Time Warner and Atlantic to

breach their fiduciary obligations to Interscope. Such

unlawful conduct by Tucker and her associates will continue

to disrupt the relationship between the partners comprising

Interscope, will create uncertainty in the music industry

about Interscope's stability and viability, and will cause a

loss of credibility and other irreparable harm to

Interscope.



<P><LI>Interscope does not have an adequate remedy at

law for the full amount of damimages and injury suffered as a

result of the unlawful actions by Tucker and her associates.



<P><LI>Accordingly, Interscope is entitled to a

preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting

Tucker, and all those acting in concert with her, from

seeking to induce Time Warner and/or Atlantic to breach

their fiduciary obligations to Interscope, or to otherwise

unlawfully interfere with the business relationship between

the partners comprising Interscope.<P>



<B>FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</B><P>



[Unfair Business Practices and Unfair Competition]<P>



<P><LI>Interscope realleges and incorporates by

reference its allegations in paragraph 1 through 12,

inclusive, as though set forth at length.



<P><LI>The wrongful conduct by Tucker and her associates

alleged above constitutes unfair business practices and

unfair competition in violation of Interscope's rights under

California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et

seq.



<P><LI>As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing

unfair and unlawful conduct, Interscope has incurred

irreparable harm and has been deprived of its property

rights for which Interscope has no remedy at law.



<P><LI>Interscope is entitled to a preliminary

injunction and a permanent injunction to prohibit Tucker,

and all those acting in concert with her, from violating the

foregoing statute; and Interscope is further entitled to all

other relief against Tucker and her associates as is

authorized by the statute.</ol>



WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays judgment as follows:<P>



     1.   For compensatory damimages in amount to be proven at

trial;<P>



     2.   For exemplary and punitive damimages in an amount to

be proven at trial;<P>



     3.   For a preliminary injunction and permanent

injunction to restrain Tucker, and all those acting in

concert with her, from continuing to engage in extortion and

other unlawful activities for the purpose of (a) inducing or

attempting to induce a breach of contract by any party to a

contract with Interscope, including but not limited to the

contract between Death Row Records and Interscope;  (b)

interfering with Interscope's prospective business

advantage; (c) inducing or attempting to induce Time Warner

and/or Atlantic to breach their fiduciary obligations to

Interscope; (d) interfering with the business relationship

between the partners comprising Interscope; and (e) engaging

in unfair business practices and/or unfair competition.<P>



         4.   For reasonable attorneys fees and costs

expended in the prosecution of this action, to the full

extent permitted by law;<P>



         5.   For pre-judgment interest to the full extent

authorized by law; and<P>



         6.   For such other and further relief as this

Court may deem just and proper.<P>

COMPLAINT</H4> Plaintiffs, by their undersigned attorneys, for their Complaint herein

allege as follows:<P>  <H3> INTRODUCTION</H3> 1. This action is brought to enjoin

violations by each defendant of the federal antitrust laws and the common law of torts

of the various states with respect to plaintiffs and similarly situated basketball

players who have entered and will enter into player contracts with NBA teams, and to

redress injuries sustained by plaintiffs and similarly situated basketball players as a

result of violations by each defendant of the federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs are

professional athletes who have been employed by individual teams in the National

Basketball Association ("NBA"). Defendants are the NBA and each of its member teams (the

"NBA Defendants"). The NBA Defendants have jointly agreed and conspired to deny

plaintiffs the ability to market their services as professional basketball players in a

competitive market through a comprehensive set of anticompetitive restrictions. As a

result of defendants' anticompetitive agreements, plaintiffs and other similarly

situated NBA players are prevented from receiving a competitive market value for their

services and are denied the freedom of movement available to employees in virtually

every other industry in the United States. Although defendants were previously held to

be protected by the nonstatutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws as long as there

was a "continuing collective bargaining relationship," the players in the NBA have

chosen to give up their collective bargaining relationship in order to assert their

rights under the antitrust laws.  <H3> JURISDICTION AND VENUE</H3> 2. These claims arise

and are brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2, and

the common law of torts of the various states.<P> 3. This Court has jurisdiction over

these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1331, 1337 and 1367. <P>4. Venue in this action is

proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1391 and 15 U.S.C.  22. Each of the defendants can be

found, resides, has an agent, or transacts business in the District of Minnesota, and

the unlawful activities were carried on in part by one or more of the defendants within

this district.  <H3> THE PARTIES</H3> 5. Plaintiff <b>Patrick Ewing</b> is a

professional basketball player who, since 1985, has been employed in interstate commerce

by defendant Madison Square Garden Corporation, which owns and operates the New York

Knickerbockers. After the 1996-97 NBA season, his contract with the Knickerbockers will

expire on July 1, 1997.<P> 6. Plaintiff <B>Michael Jordan</B> is a professional

basketball player who, since 1984, has been employed in interstate commerce by defendant

Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership, which owns and operates the Chicago

Bulls. After the 1995-96 NBA season, his contract with the Chicago Bulls will expire on

July 1, 1996. <P>7. Plaintiff <B>Stacey Augmon</B> is a professional basketball player

who, since 1991, has been employed in interstate commerce by defendant Atlanta Hawks,

L.P., which owns and operates the Atlanta Hawks. After the 1994-95 NBA season, Mr.

Augmon opted-out of his contract with the Hawks, and is currently a free agent. <P>8.

Plaintiff <B>Dale Davis</B> is a professional basketball player who, since 1991, has

been employed in interstate commerce by defendant Pacers Basketball Corporation, which

owns and operates the Indiana Pacers. Mr. Davis has the right to opt-out of his contract

with the Pacers after the 1995-96 NBA season. <P>9. Plaintiff <B>Alonzo Mourning</B> is

a professional basketball player who, since 1992, has been employed in interstate

commerce by defendant Charlotte NBA Limited Partnership, which owns and operates the

Charlotte Hornets. Mr. Mourning is in the third year of a six year contract, but has the

right to opt-out of his contract after the 1995- 96 NBA season. <P>10. Plaintiff

<B>Howard Eisley</B> is a professional basketball player who was selected by the

Minnesota Timberwolves as the 30th pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Mr. Eisley was employed

in interstate commerce by the Minnesota Professional Basketball Limited Partnership,

which owns and operates the Minnesota Timberwolves, but was released by the Timberwolves

after the All-Star break. Mr. Eisley then signed with the San Antonio Spurs and was

re-released just prior to the end of the regular season. Mr. Eisley is currently a free

agent. <P>11. Plaintiff <B>Stacey King</B> is a professional basketball player who,

since 1989, had been employed in interstate commerce by defendant Chicago Professional

Sports Limited Partnership, which owns and operates the Chicago Bulls. In February of

1994, Mr. King was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, which is owned and operated by

defendant Minnesota Professional Basketball Limited Partnership. His contract with the

Timberwolves having expired, Mr. King is currently a free agent. <P>12. Defendant NBA,

which maintains its office at 645 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10022, is an

unincorporated association consisting of the 29 separately- owned and operated

professional basketball teams listed in paragraph 14. The NBA is engaged in interstate

commerce in the business of, among other things, operating the sole major league

professional basketball league in North America. <P>13. The other defendants are the 29

NBA member teams, each of which, upon information and belief, is a corporation, except

where noted below. Upon information and belief, each of the defendant teams is a

separately-owned and independent entity which operates a professional basketball

franchise for profit under the team name and in the cities set forth below: <UL>NBA

The class represented by plaintiffs is comprised of (i) all players who have been, are

now, or will be under contract to play professional basketball for an NBA club at any

time from June 28, 1995 to the date of final judgment in this action and determination

of any appeal therefrom, and (ii) all college and other basketball players who, as of

June 28, 1995, to the date of final judgment in this action and the determination of any

appeal therefrom, have been, are now, or will be eligible to play basketball as a rookie

for an NBA team.<P> 16. The class is so numerous and geographically so widely

distributed that joinder of all members is impracticable. There are questions of law and

fact common to the class. The claims of the plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the

class they represent, and the plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the

interests of the class they represent. <P>17. Each person in the class is, has been,

and/or will be subject to uniform agreements, rules and practices among the defendants

restraining competition for players' services which are or will be uniformly imposed by

the NBA Defendants. <P>18. Except for provisions as to individual compensation and other

variations which do not materially affect this action, the player contracts are

substantially identical throughout the NBA. <P>19. In construing and enforcing their

uniform agreements, rules and practices, and in taking the actions described below, the

NBA Defendants have acted, have refused to act, and will act, on grounds generally

applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate injunctive relief or corresponding

declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. <P>20. The prosecution of

separate actions by individual members of the class would create the risk of: <P>  (a)

inconsistent or varying adjudicationswith respect to individual members of the

classwhich would establish incompatible standards ofconduct for the party apposing the

class, or <P>  (b) Adjudications with respect to individualmembers of the class which

would as a practicalmatter be dispositive of the interests of otherclass members not

parties to the adjudications orwould substantially impair or impede the abilityof such

absent class members to protect theirinterests.<H3>NATURE OF INTERSTATE TRADE AND

COMMERCE</H3> 21. The primary business in which defendants are engaged is the operation

of major league professional basketball teams and the sale of tickets and telecast

rights to the public exhibition or the individual and collective basketball talents of

players such as plaintiffs. To carry on this business, the NBA Defendants must compete

with each other for and retain the professional services of players, such as plaintiffs,

who are signed to play basketball for one of the NBA defendant teams. <P>22. The

business of major league professional basketball is distinct from other professional

sports businesses, as well as from college and minor league basketball. Its

distinguishing features include, but are not limited to: the rules of the sport and the

season during which it is played, the talents and rates of compensation of the players,

for whom playing basketball is their full-time profession; the nature and amounts of

trade and commerce involved; and the unique demand for the NBA Defendants' games by the

consuming public, both as ticket purchasers and as home viewers of and listeners to

television and radio. <P>23. The NBA Defendants' operation of and engagement in the

business of major league professional basketball involves a substantial volume of

interstate trade and commerce, including, inter alia, the following interstate

activities: travel; communications; purchases and movement of equipment; broadcasts and

telecasts of league games; advertisements; promotions; sales of tickets and concession

items; employment of players and referees; and negotiations for all of the above. <P>24.

The NBA Defendants' aforesaid interstate transactions involve collective annual

expenditures and receipts in excess of one billion dollars. <P>25. The plaintiffs have

been employed by and/or are seeking new employment with one or more of the defendant

teams in interstate commerce as professional basketball players in the NBA.  <H3>

BACKGROUND</H3> 26. The NBA member teams constitute the only market in the United States

and North America for the services of major league professional basketball players. The

NBA member teams are the only participants in that market, and the only potential for

competition in that market is between the separately-owned and independently- operated

NBA teams. However, rather than engaging in competition for the players' services, the

NBA Defendants are combining and conspiring to eliminate such competition among

themselves for the vast majority of NBA players, including plaintiffs, through group

boycotts and concerted refusals to deal. This is accomplished by the NBA Defendants

jointly adopting and imposing "rules" and "policies" that have the purpose and effect of

preventing players from offering their services to other NBA teams in a competitive

market when their player contracts expire, or from renegotiating with their current team

during the term of their contracts free from unreasonable restrictions upon those

renegotiations. <H3>The Expired CBA</H3> 27. In 1987, a class of professional basketball

players filed an antitrust lawsuit, Bridgeman. et al. v. National Basketball

Association. et al. (D.N.J. 87-4001), against the NBA and its member teams challenging

the unilateral implementation of a variety of anticompetitive restrictions, including a

"salary cap." In November of 1988, the United States District Court for the District of

New Jersey approved the Bridgeman Stipulation and Settlement Agreement ("BSA"). The BSA,

along with a new collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"), substantially modified the

anticompetitive restrictions imposed by the NBA owners, but did not eliminate them

completely. It was agreed to for a limited period of time by the NBA class in order to

provide some relief to players during their short-lived professional careers. By its

terms, the BSA and the CBA expired on June 23, 1994 -- the day after the last playoff

game of the 1994 NBA season. <H3>The Salary Cap System</H3> 28. The Salary Cap contained

in the BSA and CBA was a system whereby the aggregate salaries of a team's players were

fixed at artificially low levels. A number of exceptions were provided, but salaries

were still depressed below competitive market levels. The Salary Cap system is a

league-wide price-fixing agreement among competitors to restrict the wimages of all NBA

players. <H3>The NBA Draft</H3> 29. The BSA and CBA also included a so-called "NBA

Draft," which has the purpose and effect of dividing the market for the most wanted

first year, or "rookie," player services among the NBA clubs who would otherwise compete

against each other for those players. Under the NBA Draft, each NBA team is given the

right, pursuant to certain rules and procedures, to choose specific college and other

rookie players with whom the team will have the exclusive NBA negotiating rights. If a

rookie player for any reason does not wish to sign a contract with or play for the NBA

team which "owns" the rights to him, he may not negotiate with or play for any other NBA

club. <P>30. The allocation of negotiating rights effectuated by the NBA Draft is

enforced by a group boycott and agreement among the NBA Defendants. This group boycott

and agreement takes the form of a concerted refusal to deal with potential NBA players

except through restrictive anticompetitive practices. <H3>Restricted Free Agency</H3>

31. The BSA and CBA also included a number of other anticompetitive restrictions,

including restrictions on the ability of NBA players with less than four years of NBA

experience to market themselves as free agents. These players were subject to an

anticompetitive "Right of First Refusal" by their previous team.  <H4> The Williams Case

And The Continuation Of The Salary Cap System During The 1994-1995 NBA Season</H4> 32.

On June 17, 1994, the NBA filed a lawsuit against 17 NBA players in the U.S. District

Court For The Southern District of New York, seeking a declaratory judgment that

continued implementation by the NBA and its teams of the Salary Cap, the NBA Draft, and

the so-called "Right of First Refusal" do not violate the antitrust laws. National

Basketball Association v. Williams, No. 94 Civ. 4488 (KTD) (S.D.N.Y.). <P>33. On June

27, 1994, a group of then-current and prospective NBA players counterclaimed in the

Williams action, alleging that the continued implementation of the Salary Cap and the

Right of First Refusal, and the holding and subsequent enforcement of the 1994 NBA

Draft, violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, even while the NBA and the National

Basketball Players Association ("NBPA") continued to negotiate over a potential new CBA.

The NBPA was then the recognized collective bargaining representative of players who are

employed as professional basketball players by NBA teams. The counterclaims in the

Williams action sought injunctive relief on behalf of the counterclaim-plaintiffs and an

unspecified class, and damimages on behalf of the individual defendants/counterclaim-

plaintiffs. The counterclaims in the Williams action did not seek relief for any

class-wide damimages. <P>34. on July 1, 1994, Judge Kevin T. Duffy was assigned the

Williams case, and a hearing was conducted on Friday, July 8, 1994. At the hearing,

Judge Duffy informed the parties that a preliminary injunction hearing that the

counterclaim-plaintiffs had requested would be consolidated with a one-day trial on the

merits, which "trial" was conducted four days later, with no pre-trial discovery, on

Tuesday, July 12, 1994. <P>35. At the "trial," counsel for the NBPA and the

counterclaim-plaintiffs stated that he had no objection to certification of a class.

However, no notice was provided to the class members prior to that date, or at any other

time in the Williams action. <P>36. On July 18, 1994, the district court in Williams

held that the non-statutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws continued to shield

restraints previously agreed to in an expired CBA from the antitrust laws until there

was no longer a collective bargaining relationship between the parties. In its opinion,

the Williams district court stated as follows: <P>Antitrust immunity exists as long as a

collective bargaining relationship exists. Accordingly, the NBA is granted the

declaration it seeks -- the continued implementation of these challenged measures by the

NBA do not violate the antitrust laws as long as the collective bargaining relationship

exists. <P>This does not mean that the Players are "stuck" with these provisions

forever. Certainly, they can attempt to bargain these provisions away -- including

exerting economic pressure by means of a strike. Or the Players may request

decertification of the NBPA as a collective bargaining agent. I do not mean by this

ruling to encourage the Players to decertify their union so that they may bring an

antitrust claim. But, decertification is certainly an option the Players have. In fact,

this is exactly what the National Football League Players Union did following Powell

II.<P> National Basketball Ass'n v. Williams, 857 F. Supp. 1069, 1078 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)

(citations omitted) (emphasis added). <P>37. On July 21, 1994, the Williams district

court entered judgment in that action. The Judgment stated that the action was thereby

certified as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) on behalf of

and against a class of NBA players and prospective NBA players who were defined as

follows: <P>(1) all basketball players who were, are or will be under contract to a team

in the NBA from the date of formal expiration of the 1988 Collective Bargaining

Agreement through the date of final judgment in this action; and (2) all college and

other basketball athletes who, from the date of formal expiration of the 1988 Collective

Bargaining Agreement through the date of a final judgment in this action, were, are or

will be eligible under the Constitution and By-Laws of the NBA to play basketball for an

NBA team . <P>The Judgment stated "that the NBA's continued implementation of the

college draft, right of first refusal and salary cap does not violate the antitrust laws

as long as it is implemented as part of a continuing collective bargaining

relationship." (Emphasis added). <P>38. On January 24, 1995, the Second Circuit affirmed

the Williams decision, on the basis that the NBA players had to end their collective

bargaining relationship, if they wanted to pursue their antitrust rights. 45 F.3d 684

(2d Cir. 1995). <P> <H3> The "No Lockout/No Strike Agreement"</H3> 39. on October 27,

1994, the NBPA and the NBA executed an agreement pursuant to which, from that date until

the earlier of the day of the last game of the 1995 NBA Finals or the date upon which a

"successor collective bargaining agreement" is executed, the NBA agreed not to engage in

a lockout of the NBPA, and the NBPA agreed not to engage in "any strikes, cessations or

stoppimages of work, or any other similar interference with the operations of the NBA."

The agreement also included a moratorium on player signings. Upon information and

belief, the No Lockout/No Strike Agreement was subsequently extended by the NBPA and the

NBA to July 1, 1995.<P> The Negotiations And The Proposed New Collective Bargaining

Agreement Between The NBPA And The NBA <P>40. In and before June 1995, the NBPA and the

NBA engaged in negotiations over the terms of a potential new collective bargaining

agreement. During the course of those negotiations, numerous players asked the Executive

Director of the NBPA to disclose the potential terms that were being discussed with the

NBA. The Executive Director refused to disclose those terms. <P>41. During this same

period, from media reports and other sources, numerous NBA players became aware of the

terms of a new collective bargaining agreement that had been negotiated between the NBA

and the NBPA Executive Director. The NBA players learned that the agreement would

include onerous terms that were substantially worse and even more anticompetitive than

the terms of the old BSA and CBA. <P>42. On June 21, 1995, NBA players received a

memorandum from the President and Executive Director of the NBPA. Upon information and

belief, the shipping costs of this mailing, approximately $50,000, was paid by the NBA.

The memorandum stated that "we finally have reached an agreement in principle on the

terms of a new six-year collective bargaining agreement," and had attached to it a five

page "outline" that the memorandum stated "sets forth virtually all the proposed terms

of this deal." A copy of that outline is attached hereto as Exhibit A. <P>43. The

President and Executive Director of the NBPA also stated in the memorandum that the

NBPA's 27 player representatives would be meeting the next day in Chicago, "so that they

may vote on whether they accept our recommendation to ratify this deal." (Two of the 29

NBA teams, Toronto and Vancouver, are new expansion teams, and do not yet have player

representatives). The Executive Director confirmed in media reports that the new CBA

would not be submitted to the players for a ratification vote, and that the CBA would be

ratified and go into effect if approved by 21 player representatives the day after the

"outline" of the deal was distributed. Upon information and belief, not submitting the

new CBA to a ratification vote by all the NBA players was unprecedented, as all prior

CBA's in the NBA were voted on by all NBA players. <P>44. Numerous players opposed to

the conduct of the NBPA in its negotiations with the NBA attended the June 22 player

meeting in Chicago. At that meeting, the player representatives attending the meeting

voted to table the CBA that had been presented to them for ratification.  <H3> The

Decertification Of The NBPA</H3> 45. On June 21, 1995, the day before the Chicago

meeting, seventeen NBA players filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board

requesting that an election be held to "decertify" the NBPA as the collective bargaining

representative of NBA players. In support of the petition, statements signed by more

than 30% of the collective bargaining unit renouncing the authority of the NBPA were

submitted to the NLRB within 48 hours of the filing of the petition.<P> 46. During the

past week, NBA players continued to sign decertification petitions despite the

vociferous opposition of the NBPA's Executive Director and a few of its officers. On

June 28, 1995, the petitioning players notified the NBA and the NBPA that more than 50%

of the bargaining unit had signed petitions renouncing the authority of the NBPA to

collectively bargain on their behalf, and copies of those petitions were delivered to

the NBA and NBPA. As a result, because the NBPA is a voluntarily "recognized" union,

rather than a "certified" union, the NBPA may no longer be voluntarily recognized by the

NBA as having the authority to collectively bargain on behalf of NBA players, and any

collective bargaining relationship with the NBA has ended. The NBA players no longer

want to engage in, and are no longer represented in, collective bargaining with the NBA.

<P>47. As a result, as of July 28, 1995, there is no collective bargaining

representative to shield (under any ruling) the NBA Defendants' anticompetitive

restraints from antitrust review. <P>The NBA's Continued Imposition Of Anticompetitive

Restrictions Upon NBA Players <P>48. The NBA and its teams have announced that they will

hold the 1995 NBA Draft on June 28. On July 1, 1995, all player contracts that do not

extend beyond the 1994-95 NBA Season will expire. Upon information and belief, on and

after July 1, 1995, the NBA and its member teams will continue to enforce the market

division rules of the NBA Draft, and will also do one or more of the following: (i)

implement a claimed "lockout" prohibiting all player signings or player employment; (ii)

impose a system of anticompetitive restraints on player movement, salaries, and contract

signings substantially similar to the anticompetitive restrictions agreed to in the

proposed CBA that was rejected by the players; or (iii) impose a system of

anticompetitive restraints on player movement, salaries, and contract signings

substantially similar to the terms of the prior CBA. <P>49. Any "lockout" on player

signings by the NBA and its member teams would be an illegal group boycott in violation

of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, under both the per se rule and the rule of reason

standard. Any imposition of a system of restraints substantially similar to the old CBA

or the restrictions in the proposed CBA would be an illegal restraint of trade in

violation of the Sherman Act.  <H3> COUNT I</H3>  <H4> Section 1 of the Sherman Act</H4>

50. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 1

through 49. <P>51. There is a relevant market for the services of major league

professional basketball players in North America, and a relevant submarket in the United

States. The restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants substantially restrain and injure

competition in these markets. <P>52. The restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants

constitute an agreement among competitors to suppress competition for the services of

major league professional basketball players in North America and the United States, in

violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. This system operates as a perpetual

horizontal group boycott and/or horizontal division of markets, which constitutes an

unreasonable restraint of trade. Each of the NBA Defendants is a participant in this

unlawful combination or conspiracy. <P>53. The purpose and effect of the anticompetitive

restrictions is to suppress the market for player services and earn monopoly profits for

the NBA owners. No procompetitive purpose is furnished by these restrictions. <P>54. The

plaintiffs and class members have suffered and will suffer antitrust injury to their

business or property by reason of the continuation of this unlawful combination or

conspiracy. The restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants injure plaintiffs and class

members by depriving them of the ability to offer their services as professional

basketball players to the teams of their choice in a free and open market upon first

entering the NBA as rookie players and upon expiration of their player contracts. This

causes them to receive salaries that are substantially lower than they would have

received in the absence of those restrictions. Veteran players are also hurt by the NBA

draft, which has the effect of lowering the salaries of all NBA players. <P>55.

Plaintiffs and class members face threatened loss or damage by reason of defendants'

continued violation of the antitrust laws when their present contracts expire.  <H3>

COUNT II</H3>  <H4> Section 2 of the Sherman Act</H4> 56. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege

each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 49. <P>57. There is a relevant

market for the services of major league professional basketball players in North

America, and a relevant submarket in the United States. The restrictions imposed by the

NBA Defendants substantially restrain and injure competition in these markets. <P>58.

Defendants possess monopoly power in the markets for the services of major league

professional basketball players in North America and the United States. <P>59. The

restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants are willfully intended to help defendants

acquire and maintain their monopoly power in the market for the services of major league

professional basketball players in North America and the United States, in violation of

Section 2 of the Sherman Act, by operating as a perpetual horizontal group boycott

and/or horizontal division of markets. <P>60. The plaintiffs and class members have

suffered and will suffer antitrust injury to their business or property by reason of the

restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants. This system injures plaintiffs and class

members by depriving them of the ability to offer their services as professional

basketball players to the teams of their choice in a free and open market upon first

entering the NBA as rookie players and upon expiration of their player contracts. This

causes them to receive salaries that are substantially lower than they would have

received in the absence of those restrictions. <P>61. Plaintiffs and class members face

threatened loss or damage by reason of defendants' continued violation of the antitrust

laws when their present contracts expire.  <H3> COUNT III</H3> <H4>Tortious Interference

With Prospective Contracts</H4> 62. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations

contained in paragraphs 1 through 49. <P>63. By implementing the aforesaid restrictions

defendants intentionally interfere with plaintiffs' and class members' rights to enter

into prospective contracts with NBA clubs other than their prior clubs. Absent these

restrictions, plaintiffs and class members would enter into contracts with other NBA

clubs. <P>64. The aforesaid conduct violates the antitrust laws, the common law of torts

of the various states, and is intended to harm the players, and earn monopoly profits

for the NBA owners, by suppressing the market for player services. <P>65. Plaintiffs and

class members will be deprived, by reason of the restrictions imposed by the NBA

Defendants, of the ability to negotiate and obtain more favorable contract terms, and

will receive compensation substantially less than they would have received if they were

not prevented from entering into contracts with other NBA teams. Absent such

restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants, the plaintiffs and class members would be

free to offer their services to other NBA teams in a competitive market. Plaintiffs and

class members will suffer severe and irreparable harm if they are prevented from

offering their services to other NBA teams in a competitive market.  <H3> PRAYER FOR

RELIEF</H3> WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgment with respect to their Complaint as

follows: <UL>1.   Declaring that, as of June 28, 1995, the restrictions imposed by the

NBA Defendants violate  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act: <P>2.   Declaring that, as of June

28, 1995, the restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants constitute a tortious

interference with prospective contracts; <P>3. Enjoining defendants from implementing or

enforcing those restrictions, or any similar restrictions, which would prevent or

restrict rookie players from freely negotiating or entering into contracts with any NBA

club, and which would prevent or restrict veteran players from freely negotiating or

entering into contracts with any NBA club after their existing contracts expire; <P>4.

Awarding plaintiffs and the class they represent treble the amount of damimages they

sustained as a result of the violations of the antitrust laws alleged herein: <P>5.

Awarding plaintiffs and the class they represent the damimages they sustained as a

result of defendants' interference with their entering into prospective contracts; <P>6.

Enjoining defendants from implementing or enforcing the restrictions imposed by the NBA

Defendants, or any similar restrictions which would interfere with the prospective

contracts of plaintiffs and the class they represent with other NBA teams; <P>7.

Awarding plaintiffs and the class they represent their costs and disbursements in this

action, including reasonable attorneys' fees; <P>8. Granting plaintiffs and the class

they represent such other and further relief as may be appropriate.</UL>  <H3> DEMAND

demand a trial by jury. <P>Dated: June 28, 1995 <P> /s/James W. Quinn<br> Jeffrey L.

vlink=0000ff><img width=100 height=92 border=0 align=left src="/images/spt2.gif" alt=" *

"><I>The following are excerpts from the Counsel Connect online forum, <b>OJ Trial

Notebook.</b> Here, attorneys  discuss CNN and the media's coverage of the

Simpson murder trial. Do you think the media are biased?<Pre>



</pre>Since the trial began, I have seen quite a bit of CNN's 10:30 pm wrap-ups of the

trial and its news summaries on both the normal news and Headline news.  I now believe

that CNN's coverage (with the exception of Larry King Live) has become biased in favor

of the prosecution.   (For example, CNN's treatment of the FBI guy the last two days as

a "defense witness who turned" is terribly misleading.)  Does anyone else believe that

CNN's coverage has become biased?<P></i>-Mark R. Cheskin <br> Steel Hector -

Miami<P><I>Most of the coverage I have seen is biased in that those covering the trial

seem to ignore the concept that one should hear both sides of an argument before

reaching a decision. The trial is being covered as if it were a boxing match and I

believe the news media is doing an incredible disservice to the American system of

justice. For many people, the OJ trial is their first real exposure to a trial. Future

jury pools will now consist of people who might analzye the evidence presented as it is

being analyzed by commentators- punch by punch.<P>For example, most polls I've seen

reported ask whether the respondent believes OJ is guilty, rather than the proper

question (if such a question is proper at all at this point in the trial): Do  you

believe OJ is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</i>-H. Alan Altschuler <P> H. Alan

Altschuler - Closter<P><i>At least with televised coverage you eventually get both

sides. How often have we seen the print media run a front-page story on one side's

supposed knockout, only to bury next day's story about the cross-examination that

undercut it?<P></i>-Scott Graham <br> The Recorder - San Francisco<P><I>I am sure that

Mark, who just coincidentally happens to be a huge Buffalo Bill/OJ Simpson fan,  has

made an objective and well-supported comment about CNN's coverage.  Putting him aside,

however,  I am sure an average OJ hater/prosecution supporter would believe that the

coverage on CNN after the infamous glove demonstration, which CNN and others reported as

a terrible goof that the prosecution made, was biased in favor of OJ (even though some

would say that he appeared to be practicing his Naked Gunacting techniques when he tried

them on).  Bias, like beauty, is often in the eyes of the beholder.<P></i>  -Edwin

Torres <br> Steel Hector - Miami<P><I>One thing that has puzzled me throughout this

trial is the oft-heard insistence from commentators that we must  **all ** presume OJ

innocent until (and unless) we've heard all the evidence and he's been proven guilty

beyond a reasonable doubt? Why?  I'm not on the jury;  I can reach whatever conclusion I

want using whatever standard I want.  If I believe that , on balance, he appears to be

guilty despite some doubt, is it somehow illegal,immoral or unethical for me to hold

that belief?  The court ofpublic opinion quite properly has very different rules.  If OJ

walks, he may find that out the hard way.<P></i>-David L. Eades <br> Moore & Van Allen -

Charlotte<P><I>Edwin....are you saying that the glove thing WASN'T a terrible

prosecution screwup? If so, I'd be interested in your expanded views....David...you can

believe what ever you want, and surely will. As will we all.  It surely isn't

unamerican...perhaps quite the contrary.  If he gets off, there will be lots of folks

who will think he's guilty, anyhow; if he is convicted, there are lots ofpeople who will

think he is innocent, anyhow.<P></i>-Barry D. Bayer <br> Law Office Tech Rev -

Homewood<P><I>The distinction David draws is very important, particularly if OJ walks. 

It will also become more apparent --when OJ faces the Goldman family's wrongful death

suit, where the standard of proof for liability is only "more likely than not." Then

also consider OJ's custody battle for his children, which would be heard before a judge

sitting without a jury.<P>  The importance of the difference between the jury'sverdict

and the public's opinion on the issue of OJ's guilt hasled me to a prediction: Even if

OJ is eventually released, he will make out his own punishment for the crime -- via

suicide.  <P>I reach this prediction after considering two facts. First, here we have a

guy who lived on the adultation of the masses.  If he is released and seeks to return to

the "white world" in which he lived -- and where 80+% of the people thinkhe's guilty,

he'll never be able to go to another restaurant, theatre, party, or other public place

without someone yelling "murderer!" at him.  This will be too much for him to

handle.<P>Second, his note to the public before he took off on thelow speed chase

certainly hinted at the prospect of suicide.  And that was BEFORE the public had any

firm opinions that he was guilty.  <P>Once OJ is released back into the real world, all

the congratulatory back-patting from Johnnie Cochran and Robert Shapiro  won't help him

for long.<P></i>-Jon Drucker <br> Hill Wynne Troop - Los Angeles<P><i>Tyson and Von

Bulow didn't commit suicide. And Tyson was convicted. William Kennedy Smith seems to be

holding his own. John Dean survived. Leona Helmsly is back in her commercials. Imelda

Marcos even went back to the Phillipines. Michael Milken is doing quite well thank you.

So is Ivan Boesky. The Mayflower Madam now gives sex advice. Michael Jackson got a new

wife and a new album. <P>What suicide? The nature of  the celebrity will simply change.

Hey, this is America. Did someone mention Hugh Grant? <P></i>-Stephen Gillers <br> NYU

Law School - New York<P><I>It's a free country. You can believe whatever you please.<P>I

just think it is an aspect of good citizenship to presume innocence and hold the

government to its proofs before it exercises the power to imprison or kill. Why? First,

it's a kind of civic calisthenics; too much mobocracy makes the libertarian muscles

flaccid. It is simply a very good habit to be very skeptical of the exercise of these

state powers, and that skepticism is built into our discourse by the presumption

ofinnocence. It'd be nice if that standard was robust in jurors' civic consciences

*before* they were chosen to decide a fellow citizen's fate<br>else the transformation

we ask of people from theGeraldo level of ratiocination to judgment in court under law

would be too artificial to be counted on. True liberty ain't beanbag;  it takes

work.<P>Second, the presumption of innocence encourimages a quality that is sorely

missing from our public life: intellectual humility. We live in the era of snap

judgments and instant expertise. The presumption of innocence might remind us that we

don't know the whole story, that common sense as well as common decency suggestwe should

hear both sides of a dispute before rendering judgmenton it, that life is full of

surprises.<P>That said, there's no question that by now in the Simpson case most

people<br>including jurors -- know which way they'd vote. At this point, you might

argue, the presumption of innocence is nothing more than a necessary fiction. Like,

perhaps, an oath to tell the truth.<P></i>-Terry Moran <br> Court TV - New

York<P><I>Your point that "this is America -- anything is possible" might be well taken;

only time will tell.  Except for Tyson, though, none of the defendants you mention did

the "rags to riches" ego trip. And Tyson can fight again.  <P>What will OJ do after his

defense depletes his entire fortune?  Pump gas?  Work at the Brentwood McDonald's?  Or,

since this is America, maybe he'll run a pay-per-view TV show for $79.95 in which he

promises to tell where he hid the knife.  Wow, what a concept:  It could be the "TV

event of the Century"!  Stay tuned.<P></i>-Jon Drucker <br> Hill Wynne Troop - Los

Angeles<P>Gordon Liddy had a successful acting career and is now a syndicated radio talk

show host making, one assumes, a lot of money.<P>The not convicted Rodney King beaters

seem to be having no problem, and Fuhrman has apprently retired and is living in Idaho

(with thewhite extremists?)<P>And as someone noted on the radio the other day "Carl Van

Dorencome back...what you did wasn't so bad."<P>But while folks are entitled to make

whatever opinions they wish, and will do so....I do think it unseemly for TV and Radio (

and cable) folks ostensively on the "news" side assuming of course OJ is guilty, anyone

who thinks otherwise is an idiot, and making jokes about it.<P></i>-Barry D. Bayer <br>

Law Office Tech Rev - Homewood<P><I>Back to CNN Bias.  If you think CNN is biased - try

Rivera Liveand the Charles Groden show.  The problem with most news media and the tv

shows is that they want to try the case in 10 second sound bites while ignoring the

mundane but crucial foundational evidence.  For example, all the news shows talked about

the sock. Following the photographer's testimony about the sock not present at 3:13, the

media made a big ado about the next witness who said the sock was removed prior to 3:00. 

The media portrayed this as a major setback for the defense.  Yet most of them

completely ignored the testimony of Fung who said he took the sock at about4:30 or

something like that.  So which witness is right.  The media chose to ignore that these

witnesses were prosecution witnesses who were probable rebuttal witnesses.<P>The point

is that the media is interested in sensationalism - notjustice.  Justice is too often

too boring for the media.</i><P>-James Milliman <br> Middleton Reutlinger -

Louisville<P><I>To Terry:  I agree that the government shouldn't be able to exercise its

powers of incarceration unless it meets the "beyond the reasonable doubt" standard.  But

*I* don't have the power to incarcerate (and don't want it).  Are you really suggesting

that good citizenship  requires me to employ the  stringent reasonable doubt standard in

forming my  personal beliefs and opinions about the bad things people might have done?  

Think about it .  Am I morally required  to trust  (with my money?  with my children?)

someone  whom the evidence strongly (but not conclusively) suggests committed a horrible

crime just because he or she avoided a  conviction?<P></i>-David L. Eades <br> Moore &

Van Allen - Charlotte<P><I>I think it has to do with keeping an open mind until you hear

all the evidence. No one is under any legal obligation to do so, butit makes good sense

to me.<P>Deciding that OJ Simpson is guilty merely because of the prosecution evidence

seems equivalent of deciding the first speak in a debate wins the debate merely because

he or she made persuasive arguments.<P>The reason for "presumed innocent" is that the

state has tremendous power to accuse anyone of a crime, vast resources to investigate.

There are many examples in America and other countries of the state abusing its power.

So, to level the playing field, they not only have to prove someone is probably guilty,

but guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<P></i>-H. Alan Altschuler <br> H. Alan Altschuler

- Closter<P><i><P>That the news is biased toward sensationalism is true, but I worry,

too, about non-news media use and abuse of the O.J. trial. Dennis Miller, for example,

on his weekly HBO show, at least some of which is humerous in the way his old SNL

"newscasts" were, continuously assumes that OJ is guilty; nay, worse, implies that

anyone who does not must be an idiot.<P>There is nothing to be done for this, I suppose,

but collectively cringe, and hope against hope that if it's a hung jury, there are

enough jurors who voted for acquittal to defuse the already-building California forces

in favor of legislation or aninitiative eliminating unanimous verdicts.<P>I recently had

a discussion with a non-yet-first-year law student, my step-nephew, who thought that

there was nothing wrong with cameras in the courtroom, and thought the televising of the

OJ trial was just swell.  Sigh.<P></i>-Richard Targow <br> Appellate Attorney -

Sebastopol<I><P>I haven't watched enough CNN to decide if they are biased, and I'd be

reluctant to say so if I had, since my view would be biased. But....I will say that as

the dedicated reader of our own Court TV dialy logs of phone complaints and reader of

all of our mail, we usually get lots of complaints of bias for one side or another when

that side is putting on its case or crossing the other side's witness. In other words,

it seems to me that when we simply try to explain what one side is doing we get tagged

with siding with that side.<P> That's why early on Gregg Jarrett, for example, was the

target of constant complaints about a pro pros. bias, whereas now I keep reading and

hearing that he's a stooge for the defense. And Terry was often accused of being the

third Menendez brother (which, asbest we can tell, he isn't.)<P>My impression is that

CNN is being as scrupulous as we are tryingto be. As for Geraldo Rivera-ne-Rivers,

that's a whole other story. But who expects him to be a real journalist? <P></i>-Steven

Brill <br> American Lawyer Media - New York<I><P>Of what relevance to bias are calls

from the public....or at least number of calls from the public?<P>I assume that SOMEONE

at Court TV who doesn't have a part in this or that specific broadcast is charged with

examining the substance of the complaints on bias and also in examining the tapes of the

commentaries.<P></i>-Barry D. Bayer <br> Law Office Tech Rev - Homewood<P><I>In keeping

with the best of Counsel Connect, this thread has expanded far beyond its original

narrow focus to

some very broad, telling issues facing our society (and not just the legal system).  I

may not have the technically correct philosophical terminology here, but I see a

distinction between rights and moral imperatives.<P>So, for example, I disagree with

Richard Targow:  based on what I know of the facts -- not the evidence -- (which of

course is far more than the jury knows or should know), there is no logical conclusion

but that O.J. committed the murder.  That is, however, an entirely different conclusion

than whether the jury, on the basis of the evidence admitted at trial, should conclude

that O.J. have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  I thus agree with David

Eades and am troubled when we are told that our moral view of the case must be guided by

the constitutional standard ofguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  I think it perfectly

coherent that our system allows people to avoid criminal punishment who society

nonetheless may pronounce blameworthy.  This dichotomy exists, of course, is the power

of the state and its potential for abuse, as pointed out by Alan Altschuler.  I am

prepared, ofcourse, to listen with annoyance to talking heads telling us how O.J. must

start with a clean slate if the jury does find him "notguilty."  <P>(Aside:  I also have

the view, educated largely visits to this forum and the review of the occasional

newspaper article, that O.J. should be found guilty by the jury unless the defense finds

some evidentiary support for its alibi/conspiracy theories.  I'd be the first to admit I

don't know enough of the trial evidence to have a conclusive opinion.)  <P>This

philosophical problem pervades other areas of our society, some of which have been the

subject of other threads here.  Think back to the the thread discussing Court TV

decision on televising the Simpson children's testimony.  Again there was the confusion

between the First Amendment right to communicate information through a free press with

the moral decision of the individual member of the press to decide whether or not to

transmit that information.  Brill & Co. were mightily castigated for falling down on

their First Amendment "duty" to publish the kids' testimony.  I myself was pleased that

Court TV exercised its moral right not to transmit the information without confusing the

First Amendment as a moral obligation to do so.  I think that thepress (construed

broadly  to include all the new media) should be free to publish without governmental

interference.  I hope that this right is exercised with the sort of discretion shown by

CourtTV.<P>Now if we could just get conversations of this level of activity, energy, and

thought going on some of the "substantive" discussion groups here on Counsel Connect.

&#60;g&#62;<P></i>-Tom F. Koegel <br> Folger & Levin - San Francisco<I><P>I think we as

attorneys have a special obligation to choose our words carefully, even if the general

public doesn't always catch the distinction.  <P>I'll readily admit that I think OJ

*killed* these 2 people, but I don't know if he's *guilty* yet.  There is a distinction

there which has been pointed out by Tom.  We don't have all the evidence, we're not in

the courtroom day after day, and we hear information/rumor which is never introduced

into court.  It's very difficult to filter that out when we look at the case, which

*may*result if our having a different opinion than the jury.  But they make the

guilty/not guilty decision.  We should stay away from those words until we hear the

entire case.<P></i>-Pamela Perrone <br> CVLSF - Chicago<I><P>I know that in Scotland a

jury has an available verdict of "NotProven."  Can someone tell me what effect that

verdict has?  It might be interesting to add it to American

jurisprudence.<P></i>-Mitchell Miller <br> Gray Gleicher - Beverly Hills<I><P>Excuse me

every one! let's talk about the media and how they completely forgot that two people

were murdered. Add that every feminist group now has a famous example of a wife beater.

Everyone is using poor OJ as a scape goat. Wether he did it or not I feel sorry for him.

No matter what he does some one will hate him. They will try to kill this man in the

electric chair even though they are not exactly sure if he did it, yet they this lady in

South Carolina who ADMITTED she killed her own kids- no knows her and she didn't do

anything very controversial like beating a spouse she just killed her kids.<P></i>

-George Stallings <br> Lexis/Nexis - New York<P><I>Holy cow!  You'd think Fabulous

himself wrote the last one.  By the way, the state is not seeking the death

penalty.</i>-John Gomila <br> Jones, Walker - New Orleans<P><I><P>No doubt, many t.v.

viewers already have judged O.J. Simpson as guilty, regardless of the presumption of

innocence and not having the advantage (or disadvantage) of seeing the actual evidence

presented to the jury. (I have prejudged  him innocent, as noted by my colleague Ed

Torres above.) But does that make it right for the news media?  (I'm not talking about

Jerry Spense on Larry King Live,  Geraldo, or Dennis Miller, etc.)</i><P>-Mark R.

<H3>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT REGARDING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF

SHOOTINGS AT RUBY RIDGE, IDAHO DURING ARREST OF RANDY WEAVER</H3><p><hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT

SRC=/images/lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <B>COUNSEL CONNECT.</B>COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and

information service for attorneys. Counsel Connect is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><P>On Aug.

22, 1992, on a remote ridge in northern Idaho,  a week long standoff between white supremacist Randy Weaver

and federal agents ended in a shootout in which an FBI sniper shot and killed Weaver's wife, Vicky. The Ruby

Ridge confrontation began a week earlier when federal marshals tried to arrest Weaver for failing to appear in

court on weapons charges. At that time, a gun battle erupted between marshals and Weaver's 14-year-old son,

resulting in the deaths of Weaver's son and a marshal.<p>        The incident led  to one of the most

intensive internal reviews of an FBI investigation ever. Attorney  General Janet Reno  established a Justice

Department task force to investigate  the   events  at  Ruby Ridge. The task force concluded in a 1994 report

that the FBI's Hostage  Rescue Team overreacted to the threat of violence and instituted a shoot-on-sight

policy that  violated bureau guidelines and Fourth Amendment restrictions on police  power. The  FBI

disciplined 12 agents and employees, including Larry Potts, then the head of its criminal  division and now

its deputy director, for their roles in the operation.<p>The following  document  is the full text of the task force's  unreleased  542-page report, which was obtained by

COUNSEL CONNECT.<p>In the hard  copy of this document, some material has been deleted and marked by the word

"Garrity,"  apparently referring to U.S. Supreme Court opinion <I> Garrity v. New Jersey</I> (1967). Under 

Garrity, government employees must be granted immunity from criminal prosecution if they  provide information

during an administrative investigation.<p><p><a name=tab>   <H3>TABLE OF CONTENTS</H3></a>

</pre><I> The Department of Justice responds in this memorandum to Microsoft's demand

that a Civil Investigative  Demand issued by the DOJ be set aside. The DOJ claims that 

Microsoft has a monopoly on personal computer operating  software, and that packaging

software for its own network  along with Windows 95, an operating system, amounts to 

"bundling" and gives Microsoft an unfair competitive advantage in the lucrative on-line

market.</I><Pre>



</pre> <center>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK<P>MICROSOFT CORPORATION, <P>  Petitioner, <P> v.<P>ANNE K. BINGAMAN, in her

official capacity as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of

the United States Department of Justice,<P>    Respondent. <P>     Misc. Action No.

M8-85<P><B>MEMORANDUM OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN OPPOSITION TO MICROSOFT

CORPORATION'S PETITION TO SET ASIDE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND NO. 13187</B></center><P>

Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") asks this Court to set aside a Civil Investigative

Demand ("CID") issued by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of

Justice (the "Division") that seeks information concerning the inclusion of software

relating to the Microsoft Network ("MSN") with Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.

This conduct, Microsoft principally argues, simply "Cannot Violate the Antitrust Laws,"

Microsoft's Memorandum in Support of its Petition 10 (July 3, 1995) ("Mem." or

"Microsoft's Mem. in Support"), and, consequently, the government's investigation must

be terminated. <P> Microsoft seeks to bolster its argument with the protestation that it

has recently been the subject of considerable antitrust scrutiny. Although true, that

fact -- and the results of the Division's efforts -- tend to undermine Microsoft's

claim. Last year, the Division filed a complaint alleging violations of Sections 1 and 2

of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1-2, and a consent decree, see <I>United States v.

Microsoft Corp.,</I> 1995-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 11 71,027 (D.C. Cir. June 16, 1995)

(ordering decree entered), reversing 159 F.R.D. 318 (D.D.C. 1995) (refusing to enter

decree because, inter alia, it was too narrow in scope). And only a few months ago,

Microsoft abandoned a major acquisition after the government filed suit, alleging that

the transaction violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, see <I>United

States v. Microsoft Corp.,</I> No. C 95 1393 WHO (N.D. Cal. filed Apr. 27, 1995). <P>

The government's present investigation likewise should be allowed to go forward, and the

CID upheld. The government believes that Microsoft's forced inclusion of the MSN access

software with Win95 might, under certain facts, violate the antitrust laws, and

Microsoft points to no potentially applicable exemption from those laws. Whether that

conduct actually does violate the antitrust laws, of course, depends on the facts, which

the Division properly has been trying to gather before Microsoft releases MSN, in an

attempt to avoid unnecessary disruption of Microsoft's business plans -- or a

potentially difficult problem of antitrust remedy. The Division pressed that objective

hard; Microsoft now complains that the Division left it too little time to negotiate

modifications of, and then to respond to, Civil Investigative Demand No. 13187, although

Microsoft had every reason to believe that the government, if asked, would have granted

more time. In any event, the deadline for responding has passed, and there is now ample

opportunity to accommodate both Microsoft's legitimate interests and the Division's

undoubted right to investigate, with or without the Court's involvement. <H3>

STATEMENT</H3> Microsoft is the world's largest producer of software for personal

computers. It develops, licenses, sells, and supports a wide variety of software,

including both operating systems, which control the basic operations of personal

computers, and applications programs, which work with the operating system to perform

useful functions for computer users. Microsoft is best known for its operating system

software, including both MS-DOS and various versions of Windows. Operating system

software is essential to the operation of personal computers, and Microsoft "dominates

the world market for operating systems software that runs on IBM-compatible personal

computers ('PCs')." Microsoft, 1995-1 Trade Cas. at 74,824. <P> Microsoft's dominance in

the market for personal computer operating system software amounts to a monopoly. Its

MS-DOS operating system, introduced in 1981, runs on over 120 million personal computers

world-wide; its Windows products have an installed base of over 50 million. See

Microsoft, 159 F.R.D. at 322. No other PC operating system has more than a small

fraction as many users. Last year, the United States filed suit against Microsoft,

alleging that it had monopolized the market for operating systems for IBM-compatible

personal computers, and Microsoft, without admitting liability, consented to the entry

of judgment against it. See id. The district court concluded that "Microsoft has a

monopoly on the market for PC operating systems," id.; the court of appeals, reversing

on other grounds, said nothing to the contrary. <P> Microsoft plans to release its

latest operating system product, Windows 95 ("Win95"), on August 24, 1995. In essence a

simultaneous upgrade and replacement for the current MS- DOS and Windows 3.1, Win95 is

expected to be an extraordinary commercial success. So computer magazines proclaim: "For

the existing mass of 60 million Windows users -- and the new users who join this club

every day -- there seems to be little doubt that Windows 95 will be their

next-generation [operating system]." David S. Linthicum, How Best to Migrate to Windows

95, Byte, July 1995, at 51, attached as Exhibit A hereto. Thus, "analysts estimate that

Microsoft may sell as many as 20 million copies of Windows 95 within the first three

months of its release." Elizabeth Corcoran, Justice Dept. Again Scrutinizing Microsoft,

Wash. Post, June 9, 1995, Hruska Aff. Ex. D, Microsoft's Mem. in Support, while other

analysts suggest that sales may reach 30 million copies in the first four months, see

Dave Kansas, Wall Street Anxiously Awaits Microsoft's Windows 95, Wall St. J., June 19,

1995, Hruska Aff. Ex. C. The release of Win95 is, as yet another analyst explains, "not

your normal upgrade cycle; it is a very significant event." Molly Baker, Successful

Launch Would Be A Boon To Dozens of Firms, Wall St. J., June 19, 1995, Hruska Aff. Ex. C

(internal quotations omitted). <P> Microsoft plans to launch another product, MSN, the

Microsoft on-line service, on the same day that it releases Win95. Microsoft apparently

will require OEM-licensees to provide certain icon placements, and to provide MSN access

software and certain screens to end users who receive Win95. Thus, every user who

purchases Win95 to upgrade an existing computer, as well as the millions who buy

computers for the home with Win95 already installed, will, it appears, automatically

receive the MSN access software. <P> Microsoft announced its plan to include the MSN

access software with Win95 in November 1994. It was not then clear whether other on-line

services would be included in the package, or whether OEMs would have a choice as to

taking or not taking the MSN access software and accompanying screens, with icons in

place. [FN1] Despite this factual uncertainty, public comment, almost immediately,

focused on potential antitrust problems. Thus, for example, the November 21, 1994, issue

of PC Week, an industry newspaper, reported that Microsoft's competitors were concerned

about "the antitrust implications of bundling Microsoft Network with Windows 95." Payoff

for Marvel may be Years away, PC Week, Nov. 21, 1994, at 121, attached as Exhibit B

hereto. It quoted Nina Lytton, president of Open Systems Advisors Inc., as saying

"'[t]his is a monopoly in the making."' Id. at 128. Columnist Jesse Berst noted in PC

Week that bundling the MSN access software with Win95 would give MSN "an unbeatable

edge" over competitors, and wrote: "I'm not an expert in antitrust law, so I don't know

whether this advantage is illegal. But I do know that it feels unfair. It feels like

Microsoft is using a monopoly in one area to gain a monopoly in another." Jesse Berst,

Microsoft's on-line rivals could end up in 'cyberia,' PC Week, Dec. 12, 1994, at 120,

attached as Exhibit C hereto. <P> The Division learned more about the Microsoft Network

in the course of its investigation of Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Intuit Inc.,

for the Microsoft Network played a role in Microsoft's plans for Intuit's personal

finance software. Thus, the Division discovered that Microsoft's Manager, Business

Development and Investments, wrote in an August 1994 analysis of the proposed

acquisition that Microsoft "owns Windows and Marvel [as MSN was then known] and

therefore is in a much better position to access many millions of users in the future

with [personal finance] service options," and that once Microsoft also owned Intuit.

"[Microsoft] would be dominant in that area. Complaint 11 4, <I>United States v.

Microsoft Corp.,</I> No. C 95 1393 WHO (N.D. Cal. filed Apr. 27, 1995), attached as

Exhibit D hereto. <P> Aware of this public concern, as well as Microsoft's monopoly

power and its history of anticompetitive practices, the Division began an investigation

related to the Microsoft Network. It also filed suit on April 27, 1995, to block the

Intuit acquisition, which led to the abandonment of the planned merger on May 20, 1995.

<P> On June 2, 1995, Microsoft's attorneys met with the Division to discuss the Network.

See Letter from Bingaman to Neukom, June 4, 1995, Memorandum of United States in Support

of Motion to Strike Ex. A (June 26, 1995) ("Strike Mem."). On June 4, Respondent sent

CID No. 13025 (which addressed both the Network and other matters) to Microsoft. The CID

specified a return date of June 9, but the cover letter pointed out that the Division

"stand[s] ready to negotiate this with you." Id. at 2. On June 9, counsel for Microsoft

wrote respondent the customary letter complaining of burden and denying any possibility

of an antitrust violation. See Letter from Urowsky to Bingaman, June 9, 1995, Hruska

Aff. Ex. F. Nevertheless, Microsoft stated that it would cooperate with the

investigation, and it and the Division negotiated concerning the CID, reaching at least

tentative agreement during the week of June 4, which was memorialized in a letter the

following week; the agreement pushed deadlines off as late as June 26 and made other

modifications. See Letter from Vogt to Cohen, June 12, 1995, Strike Mem. Ex. B.

Microsoft has since produced approximately fourteen boxes of documents in compliance

with CID No. 13025, has answered the interrogatories requested, and has supplied an

affidavit requested by the Division. <P> On June 19, Respondent sent Microsoft a letter

stating that Microsoft would receive a "follow-up and supplemental CID" later that day.

The letter, after noting the return date of June 23, four days off, explained that "much

(but not all) of the document production under this CID . . . can be postponed." Letter

from Bingaman to Neukom, June 19, 1995, Strike Mem. Ex. C. Through inadvertence, the

Division on June 19 sent Microsoft only the document schedule and interrogatories

intended to be attached to the CID, but not the formal CID itself. See Horwitz Decl. 3,

Strike Mem. Ex. D. The next day, counsel for Microsoft met with Respondent; but they

said nothing about this document schedule and set of interrogatories, even though

Microsoft already had received the letter and accompanying requests. <P> On June 21,

1995, Respondent sent CID No. 13187, the CID at issue here, to Microsoft, with a return

date of June 23, and a cover letter indicating that the CID was a substitute for the

(missing) June 19 CID, which the letter described as "withdrawn." Letter from Bingaman

to Neukom, June 21, 1995, Petition of Microsoft Corporation Ex. D (June 23, 1995 )

("Petition"). Nothing indicated, however, that the June 19 letter, proposing to postpone

much of the document production, had been withdrawn. See id. Microsoft received the CID

by fax on June 21 and by overnight courier on June 22. See Vogt Aff. 11 7. Microsoft's

Mem. in Support. <P> Microsoft and the Division entered into negotiations concerning the

June 21 CID on June 22. See Horwitz Decl. 3-17; Vogt Aff. 7-14. Microsoft made a

"compromise proposal," Vogt Aff. 9, which addressed the CID as a whole and which

Microsoft apparently intended to be considered only as a whole, id. 12. Counsel for the

Division wanted to present Microsoft's proposal to others in the Division and agreed to

get back to Microsoft promptly. The discussion ended at approximately 3:20 PM Eastern

time. See id. 14. <P> Microsoft filed its petition shortly after 9:30 am the following

day, see Urowsky Aff. 8, Microsoft's Mem. in Support, three business hours later and

before the statutory deadline for doing so. Although Microsoft had not yet received the

Division's response to its compromise proposal, Microsoft never requested an extension

of time in which to comply. Upon filing its petition, Microsoft apparently lost interest

in its own compromise proposal, or indeed in any other compromise, see id. at 10,

despite the Division's continuing willingness to negotiate.  <H3>ARGUMENT</H3>By

including the MSN access software with Win95, Microsoft is taking advantage of market

position in operating systems to gain an advantage elsewhere. Such use of economic power

to gain advantage has been a persistent source of concern under both section two of the

Sherman Act, see. e.g., <I>United States v. Griffith,</I> 334 U.S. 100, 107 (1948)

("[T]he use of monopoly power, however lawfully acquired, to foreclose competition, to

gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor is unlawful."); <I>Berkey

Photo. Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</I> 603 F.2d 263, 275 (2d Cir. 1979) (holding that "a

firm violates section two by using its monopoly power in one market to gain a

competitive advantage in another"), and section one of the Sherman Act, see. e.g.,

<I>Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde</I>, 466 U.S. 2, 17 (1984) ("the

likelihood that market power exists and is being used to restrain competition in a

separate market is sufficient to make per se condemnation appropriate"); <I>Betaseed,

Inc. v. U & I Inc.,</I> 681 F.2d 1203, 1220-21 (9th Cir. 1982) (coercive reciprocity

analysis identical to tying analysis under section one). Whether Microsoft's ongoing

course of conduct with respect to its provision of MSN and Win95 violates the antitrust

laws is currently under investigation; indeed, the facts continue to unfold on a daily

basis as market developments occur and as Microsoft changes its "beta" (i.e., test

version) of Win95. <P> <B>I. Microsoft's Conduct Is The Proper Subject Of A Government

Investigation And The Government's CID Requested Information Reasonably Relevant To That

Investigation </B><P> Microsoft argues that the government's CID should be set aside

because its "potential antitrust claims . . . are so plainly insubstantial." Mem. at 13.

According to Microsoft, a CID is improper if, prior to obtaining the very information

upon which a decision to file a complaint might be based, the government "cannot assert

. . . claims consistent with its obligations under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure." Id. at 10. Indeed, in an argument heading, Microsoft asserts that its

conduct "Cannot Violate the Antitrust Laws." Id. <P> Microsoft misapprehends the concept

of "investigation," perhaps confusing it with post-complaint discovery. [FN2] Because

the purpose of an investigation is to gather evidence in order to determine whether an

enforcement action is warranted, the validity of a CID does not hinge on the

government's ability to articulate a fully-developed legal claim in advance of learning

the very facts the investigation is designed to discover. All that is required is that

the conduct under investigation faD within the Division's statutory authority.

Microsoft's conduct plainly meets this test. <P> Microsoft's contention that the CID

seeks irrelevant information is similarly flawed. The Division may seek information

"'not plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose,"' <I>FTC v. Invention

Submission Corp.,</I> 965 F.2d 1086, 1089 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (quoting <I>Endicott Johnson

Corp. v. Perkins, </I>317 U.S. 501, 509 (1943)), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1255 (1993),

and Microsoft has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that the information

requested was not reasonably relevant to the government's investigation. <H4>A.

Microsoft's Conduct Is The Proper Subject Of A Government Investigation </H4><B>1.</B> A

CID issued by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division is a

"civil administrative subpoena." H.R. Rep. No. 1343, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1976),

reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2596, 2607. Its validity, consequently, depends on both

the requirements of the Antitrust Civil Process Act, 15 U.S.C. 1311-14, and the general

legal principles applicable to administrative subpoenas. See. e.g., <I>Associated

Container Transportation (Australia) Ltd. v. United States,</I> 705 F.2d 53, 60 (2d Cir.

1983); <I>United States v. Markwood,</I> 48 F.3d 969, 976 & n.11 (6th Cir. 1995);

<I>United States v. Witmer,</I> 835 F. Supp. 208, 220-21 (M.D. Pa. 1993), aff'd, 30 F.3d

1489 (3d Cir. 1994) (Table); Petition of Gold Bond Stamp Co., 221 F. Supp. 391, 395-96

(D. Mirm. 1963), aff'd, 325 F.2d 1018 (8th Cir. 1964) (per curiam). <P> An

administrative subpoena invokes "a power of inquisition . . . which is not derived from

the judicial function" but rather "is more analogous to the Grand Jury, which does not

depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence." <I>United States v. Morton

Salt Co.,</I> 338 U.S. 632, 642 (1950). The agency accordingly may exercise its powers

"'merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants

assurance that it is not."' In re McVane, 44 F.3d 1127, 1135 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting

Morton Salt, 338 U.S. at 642-43). Microsoft's claim that its conduct is lawful

ultimately may prove correct. But the issuance of a CID to determine whether that is so

is entirely appropriate. <P> The government's CID, furthermore, need not, indeed

properly does not, focus on a specific narrowly-defined antitrust claim. Although a CID

must generally "state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged antitrust

violation" and "the provision of law applicable thereto," 15 U.S.C. 1312(b)(1), [FN3]

"in the pre-complaint stage," the Division "is under no obligation to propound a

narrowly focused theory of a Possible future case."<I> FTC v. Texaco Inc.,</I> 555 F.2d

862, 874 (D.C. Cir.) (en banc) (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 974

(1977); accord Invention Submission, 965 F.2d at 1090. Congress granted the Antitrust

Division "broad investigatory powers," Associated Container, 705 F.2d at 58 (emphasis

added), and it is "[o]nly when permitted to utilize [this] investigatory authority will

the Division be able to exercise its expertise to determine whether the antitrust laws

have been violated," id. at 60. <P> If the Division ultimately concludes that the facts

uncovered and applicable law do not warrant an enforcement action, it will not file a

complaint. But, because the very purpose of an investigation is to gather facts upon

which the decision to commence an enforcement action might be based, the conduct under

investigation need only fall "'within the authority of the agency."' In re McVane, 44

F.3d at 1135 (quoting Morton Salt, 338 U.S. at 652). See generally <I>FTC v. Invention

Submission Corp.,</I> 1991-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 11 69,338 (D.D.C. 1991), aff'd, 965 F.2d

1086 (D.C. Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1255 (1993). In light of the breadth of

the Division's investigative authority, further inquiry by the Division would be

improper only if Microsoft established that there is no conceivable possibility that the

inclusion of MSN access software with Win95 on Microsoft's terms could violate the

antitrust laws, no matter what facts an investigation revealed. Microsoft, however, has

made no such showing. <P> <B>2.</B> It requires little analysis to show that the fact

and manner of Microsoft's inclusion of MSN access software in Win95 could, depending on

the evidence uncovered, violate the antitrust laws. As Microsoft has been advised, the

Division is investigating not only whether Microsoft's conduct violates section two of

the Sherman Act, as specified in the disputed CID, but also Sherman Act section one.

See. e.g., Letter from Bingaman to Neukom, June 4, 1995, Strike Mem. Ex. A; Letter from

Zastrow to Neukom, June 28, 1995, Hruska Aff. Ex. E.; CID No. 13025, Strike Mem. Ex. A.

The possibility of a section one violation arises because Microsoft's inclusion of the

MSN access software is imposed on the marketplace primarily through Microsoft's

contracts with OEMs, and these contracts supply the concerted action required by section

one. [FN4] Microsoft also is aware, see Letter from Bingaman to Neukom, June 4, 1995,

Strike Mem. Ex. A; Letter from Zastrow to Neukom, June 28, 1995, Hruska Aff. Ex. E, that

the Division is considering whether Microsoft's conduct violates 11 IV(E) of the consent

decree in <I>United States v. Microsoft, </I>1995- 1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 71,027 (D.C. Cir.

June 16, 1995), to which Microsoft agreed to be bound pending entry of the decree, see

59 Fed. Reg. 42,845, 42,849 (1994). [FN5] <P> In any event, the Court need not decide

whether the Department's communications with Microsoft provided adequate notice that the

CID's scope encompassed more than section 2, cf. e.g., <I>Finnell v. United States Dep't

of Justice,</I> 535 F. Supp. 410, 412 & n.1 (D. Kan. 1982) ("It has been held that a CID

with an insufficient description of the conduct constituting the antitrust violation

should not be set aside if the recipient of the CID had actual knowledge of the conduct

being investigated."); <I>Material Handling Institute, Inc. v. McLaren, </I>426 F.2d 90,

92 (3d Cir.) (CID interpreted in light of correspondence), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 826

(1970), because the CID is fully valid under section two alone. <P> This is not the time

or the place to set forth the theory of the government's complaint in a case that it has

not yet decided to bring. As courts consistently have recognized, such a requirement

would severely narrow prosecutorial discretion in a manner inconsistent with the

purposes of a grant of investigatory power. See, e.g., Texaco, 555 F.2d at 874 ("The

district court is not free to speculate about the possible charges that might be

included in a future complaint, and then to determine the relevance of the subpoena

requests by reference to those hypothetical charges. The court must not lose sight of

the fact that the agency is merely exercising its legitimate right to determine the

facts, and that a complaint may not, and need not, ever issue."); cf. Microsoft, 1995-1

Trade Cas. at 74,833 (refusing to construe the Tunney Act to allow inquiry into claims

that the government did not raise and explaining that to hold otherwise would

impermissibly allow "a district judge to assume the role of Attorney General"). <P> As

explained above, see supra p.12, all that the Division needs to show to establish that

its investigation is within its statutory authority, see In re McVane, 44 F.3d at 1135,

is that, depending on what the facts might indicate, there is some possible complaint,

based on any theory that may properly be argued. To avoid unnecessary discussion,

however, we analyze below a wholly conventional section two case in order to show that

Microsoft's conduct cannot be considered, without further investigation, beyond the

reach of the antitrust laws. <P> The Division's investigation might -- or might not --

find facts that support a charge that Microsoft is using its monopoly power in operating

systems [FN6] in an attempt to monopolize the market for on-line services. [FN7] "[I]t

is generally required that to demonstrate attempted monopolization a plaintiff must

prove (1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with

(2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving

monopoly power." <I>Spectrum Sports. Inc. v. McQuillan,</I> 113 S. Ct. 884, 890-91

(1993). As for the first element, although Microsoft baldly asserts that "[t]he

inclusion of MSN access software as a feature of Windows 95 is in no sense predatory,"

Mem. at 12, the Division is entitled to assure itself that this is so. The Division

properly may consider, inter alia, whether the inclusion of MSN access software with

Win95 raises rivals' costs, "impair[s] competition in an unnecessarily restrictive way,"

or constitutes an "attempt[] to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency."

<I>Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., </I>472 U.S. 585, 605 (1985)

(internal quotations omitted). Until the Division obtains the necessary facts, it may

properly "refus[e] to speculate" as to what they might show. Associated Container, 705

F.2d at 59. And if the facts do show predatory or anticompetitive conduct, the second

element, specific intent to monopolize, may be inferred. See Spectrum Sports, 113 S. Ct.

at 892. <P> With respect to dangerous probability of success, Microsoft's arguments are

meritless. Market definition presents a quintessential question of fact, see. e.g.,

<I>Hayden Pub. Co. v. Cox Broadcasting Corp.,</I> 730 F.2d 64, 70 n.8 (2d Cir. 1984),

but the Division cannot obtain such facts unless it is permitted to investigate. The

precise parameters of the on-line market, and whether there are "obvious substitutes" to

on-line services that "are equal if not superior," Mem. at 10, remain to be determined.

Microsoft cannot avoid these questions with the simple assertion, see id. at 10-11, that

some of the information such services provide also may be acquired elsewhere. Courts

routinely find relevant markets even though particular goods or services available in

that market are separately available. See. e.g., <I>United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l

Bank,</I> 374 U.S. 321, 356-57 (1963) (finding commercial banking a distinct market

despite the availability elsewhere of particular services); <I>Thurman Industries. Inc.

v. Pay 'N Pak Stores. Inc., </I>875 F.2d 1369, 1377 (9th Cir. 1989) (discussing a

"cluster approach" to market definition that "is appropriate where the product package

is significantly different from, and appeals to buyers on a different basis from, the

individual products considered separately" (internal quotations omitted)); <I>Bon-Ton

Stores, Inc. v. MaY Dep't Stores Co.,</I> 881 F. Supp. 860, 867-75 (W.D.N.Y.1994)

(finding "traditional department stores" a distinct product market despite the

availability elsewhere of many products sold by such enterprises), amended, 1995-1 Trade

Cas. (CCH) 70,917 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 1995). Depending on the facts, that may or may not

be the case here. <P> Nor is it necessarily "fatal," Mem. at 11, to an attempted

monopolization claim that Microsoft currently lacks any subscribers to its on-line

service. A new entrant, depending on the facts, plainly could pose a dangerous

probability of monopolizing a market. No one supposes that Microsoft's share of the

on-line services market will remain at 0% for long after August 24 when millions of

copies of Win95 are sold. How fast that share will rise depends on many factors, which,

of course, the Division is investigating. See infra section II.B. To be sure, a low

market share, other things being equal, makes successful monopolization less likely, and

only unusual circumstances make plausible an attempted monopolization claim against a

new entrant. But the combination of Microsoft's monopoly power in PC-operating systems

with its proposed inclusion of MSN access software in Win95 certainly qualifies as

unusual. [FN8] <P> Finally, although Microsoft asserts that its entry into on-line

services will foster competition, see Mem. at 12, as the Supreme Court has noted, "[i]t

is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term

anticompetitive effects," Spectrum Sports, 113 S. Ct. at 892. The Division currently is

engaged in precisely this task of determining whether Microsoft's conduct is

procompetitive or, instead, threatens dominance that will be obtained through

anticompetitive means. <P> If the Division concludes that Microsoft's conduct violates

the antitrust laws and institutes an enforcement action, Microsoft will be entitled to

present its defenses. Cf. Associated Container, 705 F.2d at 59. But at this juncture,

Microsoft has failed to establish that its conduct could not violate the antitrust laws

under any set of facts. Microsoft's contention that its conduct is exempt from

investigation, consequently, is meritless. [FN9] <H4> B. The Materials Sought By The CID

Were Relevant</H4>  Microsoft disputes the relevance of the information sought in the

disputed CID. See Mem. at 8-9. This argument too lacks  merit.<P>  <B>1.</B> Information

sought by a CID must be "'reasonably relevant"' to the investigation. In re McVane, 44

F.3d at 1135 (quoting Morton Salt, 338 U.S. at 652). However, "[t]he standard for

judging relevancy in an investigatory proceedings is more relaxed than in an

adjudicatory one." Invention Submission, 965 F.2d at 1090. "The requested material . . .

need only be relevant to the investigation -- the boundary of which may be defined quite

generally," id. (emphasis in original), "or, put differently, 'not plainly incompetent

or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the [agency],"' id. at 1089 (quoting <I>Endicott

Johnson Corp. v. Perkins,</I> 317 U.S. 501, 509 (1943)). Because relevance is

"interpreted . . . broadly," In re McVane, 44 F.3d at 1136, it is sufficient that the

items sought "'might have thrown light upon' the object of the investigation," id.

(quoting <I>United States v. Noall, </I>587 F.2d 123, 125 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied,

441 U.S. 923 (1979)). Indeed, "a showing of some possible relationship to the

investigation should be sufficient." <I>Finnell v. United States Dep't of Justice,</I>

535 F. Supp. 410, 414 (D. Kan. 1982). Moreover, "in light of the broad deference .

afford[ed] the investigating agency, it is essentially [Microsoft's] burden to show that

the information [sought] is irrelevant." Invention Submission, 965 F.2d at 1090. <P>

<B>2.</B> In attempting to meet its burden, Microsoft focuses only on four categories of

information. See Mem. 8-9. [FN10] All, however, are relevant to the likelihood of

successful monopolization of the on-line services market, a question plainly within the

scope of an investigation of possible attempted monopolization of that market. More

specifically, the categories of information Microsoft challenges are relevant to the

investigation in the following ways. <UL> <B>a.</B> Because the success of an on-line

service may depend on the attractiveness of its content and the availability of that

content elsewhere, relationships with independent content providers clearly are relevant

to the potential success of MSN and, therefore, to whether Microsoft has a dangerous

probability of monopolizing the on-line services market. Microsoft appears to concede

the relevance of facts concerning these relationships, for it carefully asserts that

"almost all of [these relationships] are non-exclusive." Mem. at 8 (emphasis in

original). Interrogatories 6(d) and 7(d) in the challenged CID specifically address the

substance of that assertion. Interrogatories 8 and 9(c) pertain to it as well. <P>

<B>b.</B> Microsoft's investment and cost-structure in its on-line service are relevant

to the likelihood of MSN's successfully achieving a monopoly. Obtaining these facts may

aid the Division in both assessing the likely success of MSN and the barriers to entry

that other potential new entrants might face, see <I>Kelco Disposal. Inc. v.

Browning-Ferris Indus.,</I> 845 F.2d 404, 408 (2d Cir. 1988), aff'd on other grounds,

492 U.S. 257 (1989); see also 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law 11 421a, at 63-

64 (1995) (economies of scale may constitute a barrier to entry). See generally

Department of Justice, Horizontal Merger Guidelines 3.0 to 3.3 (1992) (entry analysis).

<P> <B>c.</B> The CID's inquiries concerning Blackbird also pertain to content and

exclusivity. As Microsoft explains, Blackbird is a tool, or set of tools, for content

development. See Mem. at 8. Interrogatories 17 and 18 plainly address possible (or, it

may turn out upon investigation, impossible) ways in which Blackbird could influence

content exclusivity, which, as noted above, even Microsoft concedes to be relevant. <P>

<B>d.</B> Finally, Interrogatory 19, which addresses the use of information about its

competitors' customers that Microsoft might obtain through use of the on-line

registration feature in Win95, also bears upon the likelihood of successful

monopolization, for such information might facilitate targeted marketing, which in turn

may make successful monopolization of the on-line services market more likely.</ul> <P>

In sum, each item of information sought "'might have thrown light upon' the object of

the investigation." In re McVane, 44 F.3d at 1136 (quoting <I>United States v.

Noall,</I> 587 F.2d 123, 125 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 923 (1979)). The law

requires no more. [FN11] <P> <B>II. Microsoft's Remaining Objections To The CID Are

Unsupported Or Should Be Resolved Through Negotiations With The Division; In The

Alternative, The Court Should Modify The CID To Require Microsoft To Respond In 10

Days</B> <P> Because a CID is entitled to a "presumption of regularity," Finnell, 535 F.

Supp. at Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 300-01 (1991) (same 411 (citing cases); cf. <I>United

States v. R. Enters.</I> with respect to a grand jury subpoena), it is Microsoft's

obligation to specify the particular features of the CID that it finds objectionable and

the reasons for objecting. Apart from the specific objections discussed above, Microsoft

has failed to do so. <P> Microsoft argued in its Petition that the CID should be set

aside because "[p]ortions of the June 21 CID are duplicative of requests for information

contained either in the June 4 CID or other information requests that the DOJ has

issued." Petition 11 44. But Microsoft failed to pursue this contention in its

Memorandum. Indeed, a single affidavit submitted by Microsoft asserts, and then only in

general terms, that portions of items requested by the June 5 CID, the validity of which

is not at issue here, previously were produced to the Division, see Vogt Aff. 11 27 (in

any event, there is no suggestion that the parties failed to resolve the problem through

negotiations). Microsoft, consequently, has not met its burden of demonstrating that CID

No. 13187 required production that was substantially and unreasonably duplicative of

prior requests. See Petition of Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 235 F. Supp. 684, 689

(S.D.N.Y. 1964) (petitioner, by merely asserting that the "bulk" of the data requested

previously had been supplied, failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that a

''significant number of the items requested in the C.I.D." previously had been

furnished); <I>Phoenix Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Justice,</I> 521

F. Supp. 828, 832 (D. Ariz. 1981) (finding petitioner's general assertion that "the

information and documents requisitioned [were] 'essentially the same"' as a prior

request insufficient to establish that a CID was duplicative). [FN12] <P> Microsoft also

asserts that DOJ's "Accelerated Schedule for Compliance" is unreasonable. Mem. at 13. Of

course, the original return date specified in the disputed CID has long since past. The

Division, moreover, consistently has indicated its willingness to negotiate with

Microsoft in order to reach agreement on a production schedule that lessens Microsoft's

asserted burden, see Strike Mem. at 5-6, and stands ready today to enter into such

negotiations. Accordingly, the Court should order the parties to meet for the purposes

of negotiating in good faith a reasonable schedule for Microsoft's achieving compliance

with the demand. See Phoenix Board of Realtors, 521 F. Supp. at 832-33 (requiring the

parties to "attempt to resolve" petitioner's objections to the scope and burden of the

demand when the government "repeatedly indicated its willingness to negotiate with

petitioner"); <I>First Multiple Listing Serv., Inc. v. Shenefield, </I>1980-81 Trade

Cas. (CCH) 63,661, at 77,551 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 3, 1980) (directing counsel to meet "in a

good faith attempt to settle questions as to the burdensomeness of the CIDs"), vacated

without opinion, 638 F.2d 1233 (5th Cir. 1981) (Table). If those negotiations fail to

produce an agreement, the Court should entertain further motions at that time. <P> If

the Court concludes that Microsoft is no longer willing to enter into such good faith

negotiations, cf. Urowsky Aff. 10, it should modify the CID to specify a return date of

ten days from entry of the Court's judgment and otherwise deny the petition. Ten days is

a reasonable period of time in which to produce the items requested. This action,

moreover, preserves Microsoft's ability to negotiate with the government for additional

time within which to achieve compliance, should Microsoft choose to do so.<H3>

CONCLUSION </h3>Microsoft's Petition For An Order Setting Aside Civil Investigate Demand

No. 13187 should be denied. The parties should be directed to negotiate in good faith in

order to resolve the issue of when Microsoft must comply with the demand; in the

alternative, the Court should modify the CID to specify that compliance is required

within ten days of entry of the Court's judgment. <P> Respectfully submitted. <P> Anne

& Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.   Washington D.C. 20008   (202) 514-2401 <P> July 13, 1995

<H3>END NOTES</H3> 1 The Division is still in the process of gathering all pertinent

facts pertaining to these issues, since Microsoft's agreements with OEMs are not yet

final. <P> 2 Although the permissible scope of CID provisions is governed by either the

grand jury subpoena standard or the civil discovery standard, see 15 U.S.C.

1312(c)(1)(A) & (B), the House report accompanying the 1976 amendments to the ACPA

[Antitrust Civil Process Act] reveals a preference for the less stringent grand jury

subpoena standard, 'tailored as it is to reflect the broader scope and less precise

nature of investigations."' <I>Associated Container Transportation (Australia) Ltd. v.

United States,</I> 705 F.2d 53, 58 (2d Cir. 1983) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1343, 94th

Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2956, 2606). Indeed, the ACPA

specifically provides that the civil discovery standard applies only to the extent that

it is "consistent with the provisions and purposes" of the Act. 15 U.S.C. 1312(c)(1)(B).

<P> 3 As a leading case explains: <P> [n]ecessarily . . . the nature of the conduct

[under investigation] must be stated in general terms. To insist upon too much

specificity with regard to the requirement of [section 1312] would defeat the purpose of

the Act, and an overly strict interpretation of this section would only breed litigation

and encourage everyone investigated to challenge the sufficiency of the notice. <P> Gold

Bond Stamp, 221 F. Supp. at 397. <P> 4 There is, of course, no need to specify have any

applicable theory of a 1 violation. We note, however, that Microsoft's Win95 contracts

with OEMs possibly could restrict access by other on-line services to installation by

OEMs of their access software or otherwise restrain trade between OEMs and the other

on-line services. It also is possible that Microsoft's contracts could be viewed as a

tying arrangement that impermissibly restricts choice by OEMs and tends to foreclose

opportunities for other on-line services. See supra p.9. Whether these possibilities

correspond to the facts is a proper matter for investigation. <P> 5 As in the case of a

potential 1 violation, there is no need to specify here any applicable theory of a

consent decree violation. We note, however, that if the contractual arrangement between

Microsoft and OEMs could be viewed as one in which the licensing of Win95 is conditioned

on the licensing of another product, the MSN access software, IV(E)(l) of the consent

decree would come into play. There also may be other ways in which a violation plausibly

could be argued. Whether these possibilities correspond to the facts is another proper

matter for investigation. <P> 6 As explained above, there is no need to discuss whether

the Division could or would bring a case alleging a 2 violation based on the simple fact

that Microsoft is using its monopoly position in one market to obtain a competitive

advantage in another market. See Griffith, 334 U.S. at 107; Berkey Photo, 603 F.2d at

275. We mention this basis for an enforcement action here, however, to avoid any

implication that, by not referring to that theory, the Division has somehow estopped

from bringing such a case. <P> 7 Microsoft also is aware that the Division is also

investigating whether the inclusion of MSN access software entrenches Microsoft's

operating system monopoly, see Letter from Bingaman to Neukom, June 4, 1995, Strike Mem.

Ex. A, in violation of 2. <P> 8 Although its value as precedent may be undercut by its

reliance on a Ninth Circuit doctrine repudiated in Spectrum Sports, 113 S. Ct. at

891-82, <I>H.J.. Inc. v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., </I>86? F.2d 1531 (8th Cir.

1989), an attempted monopolization case, is nevertheless instructive. There, the

defendant had a 0% share of the relevant market at the time of the challenged conduct,

see id. at 1543, but by the time of trial it had eliminated its only competitor, see id.

at 1536. <P> Microsoft cites <I>United Air Lines. Inc. v. Austin Travel Corp.,</I> 867

F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1989), in support of its assertion that MSN's present 0% market share

necessarily is fatal to any attempted monopolization claim, see Mem. at 11, but the case

cannot be read to stand for the proposition that a low market share in all circumstances

necessarily must defeat an attempted monopolization claim as a matter of law. Rather,

the court emphasized that it upheld the dismissal of the attempted monopolization claim

in that case based on the "evidence in the record." Id. at 742 (emphasis added).

Different facts could require a different analysis. "'It should be remembered that this

court has often announced that each case arising under the Sherman Act must be

determined upon the particular facts disclosed by the record, and that the opinions in

those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the

essential differences in the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to

which the rule of earlier decisions is to be applied."' <I>Amateur Softball Ass'n of Am.

v. United States,</I> 467 F.2d 312, 316 (10th Cir. 1972) (quoting <I>Maple Flooring

Mfrs. Ass'n v. United States,</I> 268 U.S. 563, 579 (1925) (emphasis added by court)).

<P> 9 Microsoft also asserts that the Division's investigation should be pretermitted

because the Division did "nothing for months while Microsoft and hundreds of third

parties went forward with their plans." Mem. at 14. Although Microsoft makes no specific

allegation that the investigation was brought in bad faith, cf. Markwood, 48 F.3d at 978

(discussing the heavy burden required to sustain this defense to a CID), Microsoft

apparently wanted the Division to do something different between the time that it

received Microsoft's March 31, 1995, letter, Petition Ex. E, and the beginning of June.

See Mem. at 14. Of course, as Microsoft itself explains, see Petition 24-29, the

Division, during this period, was evaluating Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Intuit

Corp., an investigation that, on April 27, 1995, resulted in a lawsuit. Also during this

period, Microsoft claims, its lawyers were working 60-hour weeks responding to Division

information requests related to that investigation. See Vogt Aff. 26. <P> 10 Although

Microsoft generally states that it "could similarly critique the balance of the

interrogatories and document requests in the CID," Mem. at 9, it has not done so.

Because the burden is on Microsoft to establish that the information sought by the

Division is irrelevant, the Division addresses only the four categories of information

to which Microsoft specifically objects. Cf. <I>Phoenix Bd. of Realtors. Inc. v. United

States Dep't of Justice,</I> 521 F. Supp. 828, 832 (D. Ariz. 1981) (general objection

that a CID sought duplicative information insufficient). <P> 11 Microsoft's claim that

the DOJ is acting as "a Roving Commission," investigating merely "in Hopes that

Something Will Turn Up," Mem. at 7; accord Petition 11 39, is analytically and legally

flawed. When, as here, the investigation is within the Division's statutory authority,

the subject of that investigation is adequately described, and the material sought is

reasonably relevant, there can be no claim that the Division "is engaged in an

unlimited, exploratory investigation whose purposes and limits can be determined only as

it proceeds," H.R. Rep., supra, at 10, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2956, 2605

(internal quotations omitted). See Gold Bond Stamp, 221 F. Supp. at 396. And, in light

of the purposes of a grant of investigatory power, a bare claim that the Division is

conducting a "fishing expedition" will not suffice. See Morton Salt, 338 U.S. at 642;

Gold Bond Stamp, 221 F. Supp. at 396. <P> 12 That Microsoft must "recanvas its files a

second time after having already searched them once" is not a sufficient basis for

establishing that a demand is unreasonable.<I> Sterling Drug. Inc. v. Clark,</I> 1968

Trade Cas. (CCH) 72,629, at 86,250 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 1968). <P>

<html><TITLE>A Company's Trade Name and Its Use (and Abuse) on the Internet</TITLE><body

bgcolor=ffffff vlink=ff0000>LEONARD, RALSTON, STANTON, REMINGTON & DANKS <br>1000 Thomas

Jefferson Street, N.W. Suite 609<br> Washington, DC  20007<br> Telephone (202)

342-3342<H3>A Company's Trade Name and Its Use (and Abuse) on the

Internet</H3><H4>Introduction</H4>A recent newspaper headline announced, "Address for

Success: Internet Name Game, Individuals Snap Up Potentially ValuableCorporate E-Mail

IDs."  The article, on the front page of The Washington Post, noted that individuals

have registered "coke.com", "hertz.com", "mtv.com", "trump.com", "esquire.com",

"nasdaq.com", "windows.com" and other valuable corporate or business names.  Other

newspapers and magazines have published similar articles.  The companies that use these

trade names daily will now be prevented from using them on the Internet.  These

companies either will have to litigate the use of their name on the Internet or reach an

agreement with the individuals or companies that registered their names.  These are not

the alternatives a company wants to face when it is thinking of going

"on-line".<P>Today, the Internet is, by various accounts, the forerunner of the National

Information Infrastructure ("NII"), or the NII itself in embryonic form.  Whatever its

eventual status, the Internet currently is an important business tool and a significant

means of communicating with suppliers, customers, and potential customers. For the

almost twenty-three million users of the Internet, it can be the first place they

encounter a company or an individual representing a company.<P><H4>Identity of an

Organization on the Internet</H4>Organizations, including companies, are identified on

the Internet by a domain name, usually the name that they use in their everyday

business.  Electronic Mail ("email") addresses, World Wide Web("www") access sites, File

Transfer Protocol ("ftp") access and other Internet services require the use of this

name.  If someone else is using a company's name on the Internet, actual or potential

customers may turn to that entity for information, believing it represents the company. 

If that transaction does notwork out well, the customer may never look to the company

again. Companies must take affirmative steps to protect their trademarked names on the

Internet.<P>Even when a company discovers the use of its trade name on the Internet and

begins to work to retrieve the name, the damage to its business can occur very quickly. 

For example, the Coke and Pepsi of college test preparation courses are Kaplan Test Prep

and the Princeton Review, and they are just about as fiercely competitive as the soft

drink giants.  The Princeton Review created an Internet address with the name

"kaplan.com" and sent advertisements from this address to potential clients concerning

the benefits of the Princeton Review.  This is the equivalent of putting Pepsi

advertisements on the side of every can of Coca-Cola.  While this would be unthinkable

in the everyday business world, the rules of the road have not yet been written on the

information superhighway or the Internet.  In a just-finished arbitration proceeding,

Princeton Review was forced to turn over the "kaplan.com" address to Kaplan Test Prep,

but only after many potential customers of Kaplan were told by "kaplan.com" that

Princeton Review was the better service.<P>The United States has committed itself to

building an information superhighway or superhighways.  If not already on-line, most

American, and many foreign, companies -- including small businesses -- will participate

in the new electronic distribution system.  But the issue of trade names, service names

and trademarks on the Internet has only begun to be addressed.  An understanding of

Internet addresses and the importance these addresses play in accessing information and

services on the Internet is crucial for businesses that want to participate on the

information superhighway.<H4>What is an Internet Address</H4>An Internet address is

equivalent to a postal address: it tells the digital transmission system of the Internet

where to contact a person.  A typical Internet email address could resemble

jsmith@psych.umn.edu .  This address consists of four parts: (1) the name of the

individual; (2) the "name" of the computer or computer network on which the individual"s

computer is located (optional); (3) the "domain" within which the computer network

islocated; and (4) the "suffix" which indicates the type of organization.  The "domain

name" consists of the domain and suffix.  These are roughly equivalent to the person's

name, street address, city and state in a postal address.<P>In the address above, the

person"s name is "jsmith."  A standard Internet convention is to use the first initial

of a person's first name, and his or her last name as the email "name" (or sometimes the

first name and first initial of the last name). Thus Jane Smith becomes "jsmith" or

"smithj."  There is a limit of eight characters to the length of this first name.  A

longer name, such as Newt Gingrich, would be truncated in an email address to"ngingric"

or "gingricn."<P>The second part of the address is the name of the computer or computer

network on which the individual is located.  Some organizations have a large number of

computers or computer networks within their overall network.  Each of these computer

networks has a "name."  In the above example, the name of the computer network on which

Jane Smith is located is "psych" (these computers, especially at educational

institutions, tend to have whimsical names, not the more mundane name used in this

example). Smaller organizations may not maintain separate computer network names;

therefore, it is not unusual, but, in fact, rather commonas more small businesses begin

using the 'net, to see a name such as jsmith@smallbiz.com that contains no network

reference.<P>The third part of the address is the domain.  This is the name of the

organization under which the computer network is located.  In the above example, the

domain name is "umn.edu."  This stands for the University of Minnesota and it is the

primary designation oforganizations on the Internet.<P>The final part of the address is

the "tag" or suffix.  This is part of the domain name.  In the early days of  the

Internet, organizations on the Internet were usually educational institutions, private

research groups and government institutions. Most were within the United States.  These

original organizations were given a tag on the end of their domain name indicating type

of organization.  Educational institutions received the extension".edu", government

organizations received the suffix ".gov",commercial organizations were tagged ".com",

and so forth.  As the Internet grew and became international, these extensions gave way

to extensions identifying the country in which the organization was located.  Thus the

tag ".ch" indicates that the organizationis located in Switzerland, ".uk" is the United

Kingdom, ".fr" is France.  American organizations, for the most part, maintain the old

naming convention and do not append a ".us" to the end oftheir name.  There are a number

of variations on this naming scheme, including multiple tags (e.g.

"jsmith@mycorp.reston.va.us").<H4>What is So Important about a Domain Name</H4>As stated

above, domain names identify the organization to which a person is attached and are used

to access information services offered by a company.  While a domain name can be

anything, it most often is the name that the organization has adopted in the commercial

world.  While the University of Minnesota could have a domain name of "school.edu" or

"here.edu", there is no obvious connection between that name and the University.  To

help identify the organization to which a person is attached, and to help identify the

organization for use in providing other Internet services, an organization uses a domain

name that calls to mind the organization's primary business name.<P>This kind of

identification can be highly important to a business that conducts some of its affairs

on the Internet.  In the case ofthe hundreds or thousands of potential test preparation

course customers sent advertisements by "kaplan.com", many potential customers probably

believe that the Kaplan corporation, or a representative of the Kaplan corporation, told

them to go to its competitor, Princeton Review.  Imagine how customers, or potential

customers, would react if they received mail from an address witha company's name,

telling them to go to a competitor, or received inferior services from an organization

with the same name and became unhappy with those services.<P>Unfortunately, InterNIC,

the organization that assigns domain names on the Internet, does not have the capacity

or the competency to check for trade name conflicts in issuing domain names.  If the

domain name is not already assigned and there is a computer on the network that responds

to the name when "pinged" (sent a test message to see if a computer responds) InterNIC

will issue the domain name.<P>Recently, many people and organizations have begun to

register domain names that consist of the names of other companies.  Names such as

"hertz.com", "coke.com", "mcdonalds.com", "nasdaq.com" and others have been registered

by individuals other than the owners of those trademarked names.  While it is possible

that the owners of these trademarked names can sue for trademark infringement and win,

this solution is both time consuming and resource consuming. Furthermore, as this

particular scenario has not been litigated, it is not clear that the requisite elements

of trademark infringement could be found in cases involving an Internet address.<H4>What

Should Be Done</H4>Companies that plan or hope to participate in the NII or the Internet

and companies that merely want to protect their trademark from dilution should register

their domain name.  There are only two registration requirements: (1) the name cannot

already havebeen registered; and (2) there must be a computer attached to the Internet

that answers to that name.  There are companies that will register a domain name for

another company and supply a computer that will respond to the domain name when "pinged"

by InterNIC. The cost is minimal.<P>Companies that discover that their name is currently

being used as a domain name on the Internet must consider the possible dilution of their

trademark or trade name by this unchallenged, unauthorized use of their mark or name on

the Internet.  There are several options available to companies in this particular

situation.  We are prepared to assist you in exploring thes eoptions.  For further

                      CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE OFFENSE

         Defendant was one of the two detectives originally

assigned to investigate the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and

Ronald Goldman. He arrived at the crime scene located on Bundy

Drive in Brentwood in the early morning hours of June 12, 1994.

Upon arrival, Defendant began his investigation.

         Within an hour of his arrival, defendant was notified

two more senior detectives had been assigned responsibility for

the case.

         When the two senior detectives arrived, they requested

defendant accompany them to the house of the deceased

woman's husband. At this second location, Rockingham Drive,

defendant made several evidentiary discoveries which eventually

led to the arrest of O.J.Simpson the former husband of the

deceased woman.

         In July, 1994, defendant appeared as a witness for the

prosecution in the preliminary hearing of the homicide case

against Simpson.

         Defendant was called as a prosecution witness in the

homicide trial of People v. Simpson (Los Angeles Superior Court

No. BA 097211) in March, 1995. Defendant was cross-examined on

March 14 and 15, 1995. On March 15, 1995 defendant was asked

the following questions by the cross-examiner and gave the

following answers:

Q. "I will rephrase it. I want you to assume that

perhaps at sometime since 1985 or 6, you addressed

a member of the African American race as a nigger.

Is it possible that you have forgotten that act on

your part?"

A. "No, it is not possible."

Q. "Are you therefore saying that you have not used

that word in the past ten years, Detective

Fuhrman?"

A. "Yes, that is what I'm saying."

Q. "And you say under oath that you have not addressed

any black person as a nigger or spoken about black

people as niggers in the past ten years, Detective

Fuhrman."

A. "That's what I'm saying, sir."

Q. "So that anyone who comes to this court and quotes

you as using that word in dealing with African Americans

would be a liar, would they not, Detective Fuhrman?"

A. "Yes, they would."

Q. "All of them, correct."

A. "All of them."

(Source: People v. Simpson, Vol. 107, page 18899)

On September 5, 1995, Laura Hart McKinny testified. In

her testimony she laid the foundation for two tape recorded

excerpts which, in Defendant's own statements as recorded,

impeached defendant's denial of any use of the racial

epithet during the ten year period. She also testified that

defendant had used the epithet in non-recorded conversations

during the ten year time period.

Three other witnesses, Kathleen Bell, Natalie Singer

and Roderick Hodge, each testified to instances of

defendant's use of the racial epithet within the ten year

period.

On September 6, 1995, defendant was recalled to the

witness stand as a defense witness. Out of the presence of

the trial jury, defendant asserted his constitutional right

not to incriminate himself.

DEFENDANT'S STATEMENT

Through his attorney, defendant has stated he is entering

a People v. West plea because he believes it is in his best

interest to do so. Defendant deeply regrets the effect his

testimony has had on the general public, the Los Angeles

Police Department and its employees, and his family.

SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

Violation of Penal Code section 118 is a felony punishable

by a term of two, three or four years in prison. A person

convicted of the offense is eligible for probation and may be

supervised out of state pursuant to the interstate compact.

Criteria Affecting Probation [Rule of Court 414]

(a) Crime related facts:

(1.) Seriousness as compared to other instances of

the same crime

While perjury is always a serious offense, it is

rare that a witness who has given testimony is

prosecuted for that perjury. When there is

prosecution, the usual case involves a situation in

which the witness has given false testimony about an

event related to the crime or provided a false alibi.

Here there is no evidence that defendant gave any

false testimony about his investigative efforts. The

false testimony related to personal use of a racial

epithet during a time period that pre-dated the

criminal investigation.

An argument can be made that this type of perjury

is less serious than giving false testimony about the

investigation.

(a)(2) No weapon was involved.

(a)(3) No individual victim was involved.

(a)(4) No injury was inflicted on any person.

(a)(5) There was no individual who suffered monetary loss.

(a)(6) Defendant was an active participant in the crime.

(a)(7) There are unique circumstances in the commission of the

       offense.

(a)(8) No criminal sophistication was demonstrated.

(a)(9) The defendant did take advantage of a

       position of trust and confidence in the

       commission of the offense.

(b) Defendant Related Facts

(b)(1) No prior criminal record.

(b)(2) Not applicable because defendant has never

       before been placed on parole or probation.

(b)(3) Defendant is willing to comply with the

       terms and conditions of probation.

(b)(4) Defendant is able to comply with the terms

       of probation.

(b)(5) Imprisonment would create financial hardship

       on the defendant's dependents. Because of

       his background as a police officer defendant

       would be at risk in prison. There is no

       evidence that defendant needs to be

       incarcerated to deter him from future

       similar criminal conduct.

(b)(6) Defendant's primary adult employment was as a

       peace officer. One result of this conviction is

       defendant is precluded from ever again being

       a peace officer in California. (Government

       Code, Section 1029.) The high profile that

       resulted from the events surrounding the

       crime as well as the news focus that the

       conviction will create will make it

       difficult for defendant to find employment

       at any professional level.

(b)(7) The remarks of defendant as reported by his

       counsel indicate remorse.

(b)(8) Defendant presents no danger to others.

It would appear that defendant is an appropriate

candidate for probation.

Circumstances In Aggravation [Rule of Court 421]

The factors which appear to be circumstances in

aggravation are:

Rule 421(a)(6): Defendant's perjury illegally

                interfered with the judicial process.

Rule 421 (a)(11): Defendant took advantage of a

                  position of trust.

Circumstances In Mitigation [Rule of Court 423]

The factors which appear to be circumstances in

mitigation are:

Rule 423(a)(6): There was no physical harm to any persons

                or property.

Rule 423 (b)(1): The defendant has no prior criminal

                 record.

Rule 423(b)(3): The defendant has voluntarily

                acknowledged wrong doing at an early

                stage of the criminal process.

4) Orenthal James Simpson is and was a resident of the County of Los Angeles.<P> 



5) At all times herein mentioned, decedent Nicole Brown Simpson was a resident of the

County of Los Angeles.<P> 



6) The true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate or otherwise

result of said acts.<P> 



10) As a proximate result of the assault, battery and murder of Nicole Brown Simpson by

defendants, and each of them decedent was required to and did employ physicians and

12) In doing the acts herein alleged, defendant, and each of them, acted with

oppression, fraud and malice, and plaintiff is entitled to punitive and exemplary

damages in an amount to be proven at the time of trial.<P> 



WHEREFOR, plaintiff prays judgment as follows:<P><UL>



1) For medical and related expenses according to proof.<P> 



2) For personal property according to proof.<P>



3) For punitive and exemplary damages according to proof.<P>

library professionals will gather online to discuss the timely issues in
library management and research.  For a registration fee of $75, we'll

<P><B>I.  Information media</B></P>

<P>-- The ups and downs of print versus electronic resources </P>

<P>-- Is CR-ROM just another fad, or is it here to stay?   </P>

<P>-- Training issues</P>

<P>-- Working with the MIS department</P>

<P><B>II.  Marketing the Library</B></P>

<P>--  Communications tools, such as newsletter and special events </P>

<P>--  Working with firm management</P>

<P>-- Budget issues such as the impact of publishers consolidation on
pricing and purchasing options </P>

<P>-- The impact of the Internet</P>

<P><B>III.  Other topics</B></P>

<P>--  Vendor-neutral citation form</P>

<P>--  Summer associates, first-year associates </P>

<P>--  Space management</P>

<P>Why should you attend this seminar?  You'll learn the best ways to
handling these issues -- right  from your desk, day or night.   You'll
interact with the panelists and other attendees: ask a question, comment
on a statement, or pursue a particular issue to your satisfaction. </P>

<h3 align=center><font color=42426F>Virtual Book Tour:<BR> Reel Justice</font></h3> 

<H4 align=center>September 9 - 22</H4>

<blockquote>


<P>Who can forget Jack Nicholson's explosive testimony in "A Few Good Men"?
Or Marisa Tomei's hilarious discourse on Positraction tire marks in "My
Cousin Vinny?" Hollywood knows that for lawyers and nonlawyers alike, the
stuff of the legal profession makes for good entertainment. </P>

<P>But how accurately do Hollywood producers portray the machinations of the
legal profession on the silver screen? When do they ignore the rules of
evidence to create a better drama? Join Michael Asimow and Paul Bergman
online to discuss their book, "Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the
Movies." "Reel Justice" is a tour of over 50 courtroom movies in which the
authors rate each on the bases of quality, dramatic power and authenticity
of trial scenes.</P>

<P>So, get ready to review the movies that help shape public perceptions
about the legal profession. Join Michael Asimow and Paul Bergman online
starting September 9. You can find them in DISCUSS; Counsel Connect
Seminars; Virtual Book Tours.</P>

of the legal community.  The resulting collection of essays -- sometimes
surprising, often profound, and always thought-provoking -- recently was
published in the Law Review's special Faith and the Law Symposium issue.</P>

<P>Counsel Connect, in cooperation with the <I>Texas Tech Law Review</I>, will
continue the discussion in a unique online symposium led by a panel of
prominent lawyers from a wide range of specialties and religious
traditions.  Among the issues they'll address in this program are:</P>
<UL>
<P><LI> How religious beliefs shape their approach to their legal work</P>

<P><LI> Whether their faith lives and professional lives are in harmony or
discord</P>

<P><LI> How faith has contributed to their career in times of crisis and
success.</P>
</UL>
<P>Join our more than 20 panelists, including Texas Supreme Court Justice Raul
A. Gonzalez, St. Mary's School of Law Dean Mary Aldave, and University of
Texas School of Law Profession Sanford Levinson, for this lively debate.  
We look forward to getting your input on this intellectually provocative
topic beginning August 5 in the Faith and the Law forum under Counsel
Connect Seminars.
</UL>
<P>Join the online panel in DISCUSS under Counsel Connect Seminars and Special
Events beginning July 24.  Please call our Customer Service Department if
you have any questions about this program. </P>

in addition to our own electronic citation which has been approved in the
16th Edition of the Harvard Bluebook. And with V., you are guaranteed to
have the most up-to-date case results. V. updates its opinions library
several times a day, and in most cases you will have access to appellate
cases within twenty-four hours or release by the court. There are no extra

<P>What do you do if your client is running a sweatshop? In the Hofstra
Legal Ethics Seminar, which took place in March and April, Counsel
Connect members and some of the foremost voices in the legal ethics
community debated the ethical and moral obligations of attorneys. In a
thread titled "Code of Ethics," members discussed what an attorney
should do when he or she finds a client's actions immoral. </P>

<P>From March 22 to June 17, 1996, Counsel Connect surveyed members on
whether a lawyer can ethically drop a client who doesn't measure up to
the attorney's moral standards. We received 154 responses. Eighty-one
percent of the responses said, yes, an attorney could drop the client.
Nineteen percent said he or she could not ethically drop the client.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2 align=center><font color=ff0000>Grappling With the Right to Die</font></H2>

<P>On March 6th, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that terminally
ill patients have a constitutional right to die with the assistance of a
physician. </P>

<P>From March 15 to May 2nd, Counsel Connect asked members if they thought
that terminally ill patients have a right to physician-assisted suicide,
and whether the U.S. Supreme Court will affirm the 9th Circuit's opinion,
if it grants cert in that case. </P>

<P>We received 205 responses, and found that while a large majority (81
percent) supported the right to die, only about two-thirds (64 percent)
believed that the Supreme Court would support the right to die.</P>

<H4>Survey Questions and Results:</H4>

<P>1) Do you think that terminally ill patients should have the right to end
their lives with the assistance of a physician? </P>

<P>Yes: 167 responses (81 percent)</P>

<P>No: 38 responses (19 percent)</P>

<P>2) If this case goes to the Supreme Court, do you think it will support the

<P>A kiss is just a kiss -- or is it?</P>

<P>Most people would recognize sexual harassment in its most blatant form. But
sexual harassment based on a hostile environment, increasingly the basis of
litigation, is harder to define.  </P>

<P>From March 8 to May 15, Counsel Connect asked members to look at three
hypothetical situations and decide whether sexual harassment had occurred.
No consensus emerged: 71 percent of responses said the first hypothetical
described sexual harassment, 53 percent of responses said the second
hypothetical described sexual harassment, and 25 percent of responses said
the third hypothetical described harassment.</P>

<H4>The Survey and Responses:</H4>

<P>1) Buck, a male associate in the patent section of a major law firm, is
asked out for a drink after work by Hillary, a female managing partner in
the litigation section. She's been eyeing Buck--and is pleased that he
doesn't work in her department. </P>

<P>Buck agrees to the date because Hillary is a partner, and Buck wants to get
promoted to the litigation panel. As they continue drinking at the bar,
Hillary occasionally touches Buck's thigh, and after five drinks, she
propositions him. He reluctantly agrees (he's also smashed). </P>

<P>Hillary later learns from Donna, another partner, that that Buck has "told
all" about the incident. Mortified, she says to Donna, "It's probably best
Buck not be put in litigation--because it would be uncomfortable for me to
supervise him." Donna agrees. </P>

<P>Despite Buck's assessment that his work seemed fine, he is not made
partner, nor was his request to move to litigation ever approved. Is this
sexual harassment?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes: 139 responses (71 percent)</P>

<P>No: 58 responses (29 percent)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>2)</B> Solo practitioner Bill has three female secretaries. He requires them to
wear skirts or dresses (no pants) because he thinks women should show off
their legs, but he has not made any comments to the women about their legs.</P>


<P>Bill keeps the thermostat at 60 degrees because he believes you get more
productivity out of women when the office is kept cool. He also believes
you get better productivity from women if you yell at them and slam the
door. </P>

<P>Bill does not yell at the male law clerk. The male law clerk wears pants.</P>

<P>Is this sexual harassment?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes: 105 responses (53 percent)</P>

<P>No: 92 responses (47 percent)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>3)</B> Candy has just finished secretarial school and starts a new job with the
law department of a major bank. Candy's direct supervisor is Lori, a
secretary who has been with the bank for 15 years. </P>

<P>Candy, wanting to get promoted, asks Jim, the general counsel and senior
vice president, out for a date. The dating between Jim and Candy is obvious
to fellow employees and lasts several months. Jim frequently leaves
messages of a sexual nature on Candy's e-mail; Lori sees one in passing and
finds it to be offensive. </P>

<P>After three months, Candy is promoted by Jim to the job classification of
legal assistant, a position that pays more than Lori receives as senior
secretary.</P>

<P>Is this sexual harassment?</P>

<UL>Lawyer Search </A>is an electronic directory of lawyers who are <a
href="/inside/about.html">Counsel Connect</a> members. Although it is not a
comprehensive directory of lawyers, it has one key benefit: All
the lawyers listed here are accessible by e-mail. Any listing you find in Lawyer
Search will include the lawyer's e-mail address and a link you can use to send
him or her a  message, instantly.
<P>
The directory is searchable by several categories, including name, firm or
company, city, state, area of expertise, law school, and bar admission (you'd
use
this category if you wanted to find a lawyer in New York who was also licensed
to
practice in California, for example).
<P>
Some listings also include narrative descriptions of the lawyer's experience, as
well as links to other Web sites -- firm home pages, helpful legal resources,
etc.

<P><B>B</B>erger  & Montague was founded in 1970 by David Berger to concentrate on the representation of plaintiffs in a series of antitrust actions,  including the landmark electrical equipment price-fixing cases. Since the firm's creation,  Berger  & Montague's lawyers have represented both plaintiffs and defendants in antitrust actions,  the latter in both civil and criminal proceedings. The firm has recovered well over $1 billion for its clients as plaintiffs in both class and individual antitrust actions,  and has obtained successful results for corporate and individual defendants in both criminal and civil antitrust matters,  including class and individual cases. Among those cases was <I>Bogosian </I>v.<I> Gulf Oil Corp</I>.,  which alleged horizontal and vertical restraints among 15 oil companies,  and resulted in substantial monetary settlements plus ground-breaking injunctive relief.
<P><BR><P>As a firm devoted almost exclusively to litigation,  and with its roots solidly in contingent fee business work,  Berger  & Montague has long been accustomed to being paid solely for results. Working with a client from the inception of a new matter,  Berger  & Montague structures its own incentives so that it profits by obtaining the best outcome for its clients.<BR><P>Berger  & Montague's lawyers participated on behalf of plaintiffs in the first modern class antitrust actions,  filed and successfully pressed even before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were amended in 1967 to codify the mechanisms applied in these cases. Berger  & Montague's lawyers have displayed the same creativity in representing defendants in both civil and criminal antitrust matters. The firm's lawyers have represented clients in antitrust matters before Congress,  state and federal courts and agencies throughout the United States,  and in tribunals in other nations.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI><B>David Berger</B> (<I>215-875-3030</I>),  who specializes in complex litigation,  is the founding member of the law firm. Mr. Berger headed the first antitrust class action and for over 30 years has successfully litigated numerous antitrust cases,  one of which was the famous Bogosian case discussed above. Mr. Berger,  who is a former city solicitor for the City of Philadelphia and is a life member of the American Law Institute and the Judicial Conference of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals,  was appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court and served on the committee which drafted the Federal Rules of Evidence. He is a member of the Board of Overseers of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The university has established the David Berger Chair of Law.<BR>
<BR><LI><B>H. Laddie Montague,  Jr.</B> (<I>215-875-3010</I>),  who has been practicing antitrust law for more than 30 years,  is the chairman of the firm's antitrust department.

Mr. Montague has been lead or co-lead counsel in numerous class action antitrust cases,  including <I>Bogosian </I>v.<I> Gulf Oil Corp.</I>,  and <I>In re Infant Formula Antitrust Litigation</I>,  which resulted in settlements of more than $120 million. He recently was one of the trial counsel for plaintiffs in the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> oil spill trial (District of Alaska). Mr. Montague,  who has testified before committees of the U.S. Senate and House on antitrust and RICO bills and lectured at seminars sponsored by Columbia University and Temple University's schools of law,  is a trustee of Dickinson School of Law.<BR>

He defended several corporations in a series of individual and class actions brought against them by former franchisees and dealers,  and obtained successful judgments or settlements in all of these cases. In proceedings against the world's largest hops brokers,  Mr. Davidoff successfully represented the brokers in a government proceeding and then favorably resolved a series of class and individual civil actions in which they were defendants. Mr. Davidoff represented a Canadian communications firm in a landmark Canadian case which resulted in the first decision breaking Bell Canada's monopoly over telecommunications equipment. He has lectured frequently on antitrust and other litigation topics,  and served on the ABA subcommittee which revised the standard `Antitrust Civil Jury Instructions' in 1985.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Howard I. Langer</B> (<I>215-875-3044</I>) specializes in complex litigation. He has tried several antitrust and other complex commercial cases throughout the country,  both as lead trial counsel and as a member of trial teams in complex multidistrict litigation. Most recently,  he was responsible for briefing by private plaintiffs in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Hartford Fire Insurance Co. </I>v. <I>California</I>,  a case involving the construction of the insurance industry exemption from the antitrust laws. Mr. Langer is a member of the American Law Institute and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1977.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Martin I. Twersky</B> (<I>215-875-3054</I>) has practiced antitrust law and complex litigation at Berger  & Montague for 15 years,  during which he has successfully represented numerous plaintiffs and defendants in both individual and class actions pending in state and federal courts.

<P><B>F</B>ried Frank is a national law firm with a practice that is international in scope,  having its principal office in New York and other offices in Washington,  D.C.,  Los Angeles and London. The Firm's more than 350 attorneys represent businesses and individuals in complex matters,  many of them in the forefront of financial and legal developments.<BR>
<P>Fried Frank attorneys are involved in all aspects of litigation involving business competition in the marketplace. They advise on and litigate antitrust,  unfair competition,  and consumer protection matters,  and also appear before government agencies in connection with these matters. The practice encompasses the full range of trade regulation issues,  including price-fixing,  monopolization,  tying,  exclusive dealing,  resale price maintenance and price discrimination,  franchise litigation,  false advertising claims,  and unfair competition matters.<BR>
<P>Our attorneys have a proven track record litigating cases of this type. By way of example,  we successfully moved to terminate the decades-old consent decree restricting the operations of Loews Theatres and the order restricting the operations of Tri-Star Pictures,  the first time that a movie industry decree had been terminated. We also frequently litigate trade practice issues,  such as dealer termination suits for the U.S. distributor of Mont Blanc pens,  as well as false advertising claims brought by state agencies,  the FTC,  and private parties. And we regularly appear before the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice in connection with mergers governed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Examples of transactions in which we successfully represented clients in their merger activities include General Instrument in the sale of its defense business to Litton Industries,  Connaught Laboratories in its vaccine joint venture with Merck,  and Sundstrand in its acquisition of Westinghouse's Electrical Systems Division. Among other major antitrust,  unfair competition,  and consumer protection clients are Arthur Andersen,  Columbia Pictures,  A.B. Electrolux,  GKN,  Hilti,  Hunter Douglas,  Ivaco,  L.A. Gear,  McCrory,  National Service Industries,  Pullman,  Sears Roebuck,  Televisa,  S.A.,  and 3M.<BR>

<P><B>T</B>he Sherman Antitrust Law of 1890 was enacted long after the founding fathers of Gray Plant Mooty opened the doors of their law practice; but they studied hard and soon began counseling their clients regarding this `emerging' area of the law. Over a century later,  the antitrust laws continue to `emerge' and Gray Plant Mooty continues to provide counseling and tribunal/trial representation in all areas that antitrust (and unfair competition) laws intersect with your business (or that of your client),  including the following:<BR>
<UL><BR><BR><LI> Distribution and pricing practices (including price and non-price vertical restraints)<LI> Licensing of intellectual property rights<LI> Monopolies and regulated industries<LI> State and federal investigative demands<LI> Mergers and acquisitions (including premerger filings)<LI> Immunities and exemptions<LI> Trade associations and joint ventures<LI> Refusals to deal<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>P</B>aul,  Weiss,  Rifkind,  Wharton  & Garrison,  one of the largest New York-based law firms,  is a globally-oriented full service firm with experience in almost every significant field of contemporary law. We have been very active in antitrust and trade regulation practice for over 40 years.<BR>
<BR><P>As with other areas of our practice,  our clients on antitrust matters come from all parts of the United States and many parts of the world. We have been involved in antitrust matters involving virtually every industry,  including: motion pictures,  recorded music,  insurance,  financial services,  automobiles,  auto parts,  steel,  soft-drink bottling,  tobacco,  electrical products,  electronics,  computers,  food products,  food retailing,  forest products,  chemicals,  pharmaceuticals,  agricultural products,  mining,  airlines,  industrial equipment,  oil and gas,  machine tools,  health care,  and consumer goods.<BR><BR><P>Our antitrust practice includes extensive counseling and advice,  as well as representation of clients in litigation and regulatory matters. On the counseling side,  we have devised antitrust compliance programs for a variety of clients,  and we regularly advise clients on such matters as mergers,  acquisitions,  joint ventures,  distribution practices,  dealership and franchising issues,  pricing programs,  promotional programs,  consent decrees,  trade association activities,  and advertising regulation.<BR>
<BR><P>In counseling our clients on antitrust matters,  we bring to bear our constant review of developments in the law and changes in enforcement policies and practices,  as well as our extensive experience litigating antitrust cases. We are thus especially well-equipped to bring an important dimension to our antitrust counseling,  advising clients on the basis of practical experience with how a governmental agency,  judge,  or jury will react to the facts,  as well as our knowledge of the relevant legal principles.<BR>
<BR><P>Our antitrust litigation experience includes many of the most significant antitrust cases of the modern era and cases involving great complexity. Among other matters:<BR>
<UL><BR><LI> We represented ASCAP at trial and on appeal in <I>BMI and ASCAP </I>v.<I> CBS</I> the seminal U.S. Supreme Court decision in the area of joint associations and joint ventures and have been involved in virtually every important antitrust case involving the recorded music industry,  as well as landmark actions involving cable television.<BR>
<BR><LI> We handled at trial and on appeal <I>FTC </I>v.<I> BOC International</I> and <I>In re</I> <I>B.A.T. Industries,  Ltd. and Appleton Papers,  Inc.</I> leading cases that significantly limited the potential competition doctrine under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.<BR>
<BR><LI> We represented the motion picture industry in its antitrust suit against the television networks.<BR>
<BR><LI> We defeated a hostile attempt to take over our client Consolidated Gold Fields by private antitrust litigation,  establishing (in the Second Circuit) that a takeover target has antitrust standing under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.<BR>
<BR><LI> We represented Brown  & Williamson Tobacco Company in what we believe is the largest Robinson-Patman Act claim to go to a jury.<BR>
<BR><LI> We represented British Airways in the antitrust litigations growing out of the demise of Laker Airways.<BR>
<BR><LI> We represented a number of <I>amici curiae</I>,  and successfully argued the appeal,  in antitrust litigation by the Department of Justice against Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  a pivotal case involving charges of conspiracy among the eight Ivy League universities.<BR>
<BR><LI> We successfully defended Armstrong World Industries in the retrial of a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act,  obtaining a judgment in Armstrong's favor after a first trial resulted in an adverse judgment of $239 million.<BR>
<BR><LI> We are currently representing one of the NASDAQ market makers involved in a group of class actions under Section 1 of the Sherman Act,  and a much-publicized Justice Department investigation,  concerning market making practices on NASDAQ.<BR></UL>
<BR><P>Our antitrust practice embraces representations in virtually all forums and procedural settings. We have been before the Federal Circuit and other federal courts in complex patent-antitrust cases,  and our lawyers have handled class actions and individual actions in courts throughout the United States involving virtually all aspects of federal and state antitrust and trade regulation law. We also have substantial experience representing clients in civil and criminal investigations and actions by federal and state law enforcement authorities,  and we frequently represent clients before the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission in connection with mergers,  acquisitions,  and divestitures.<BR>
<BR><P>Paul,  Weiss's international orientation is well reflected in our antitrust and trade regulation work. We have advised many clients based outside the United States concerning the antitrust aspects of acquiring and operating companies in this country. We have also counseled international clients concerning the extraterritorial reach of the U.S. antitrust laws and the circumstances in which conduct abroad may violate those laws.<BR>
<BR><P>Our lawyers have handled significant international antitrust cases in the United States such as the Laker Airways litigation and the Gold Fields/Minorco takeover battle. We successfully represented Komatsu Electronic Metals,  Inc.,  in a major antitrust dispute with Union Carbide Corporation,  which,  among other things,  tested the extent to which antitrust claims may be subject to international arbitration. We represented another Japanese client in connection with a U.S. Justice Department investigation of alleged bid rigging involving Defense Department contracts let in Japan. We have also represented companies from the United States and other countries in antitrust matters before the Commission of the European Communities and the International Court of Justice.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Litigation Practice Group</H3></CENTER>

<P>Throughout its history,  Covington  & Burling's practice has been heavily concentrated on the litigation of complex,  difficult,  important,  and novel matters. The firm's litigation practice continues to reflect those characteristics and today runs the gamut of subject-matter areas,  including antitrust,  employment,  environmental,  insurance coverage,  intellectual property,  product liability,  professional responsibility,  securities,  toxic tort,  and regulatory cases in judicial,  arbitral,  and administrative forums across the country and overseas. The hallmarks of our litigation practice are mastery of the law,  the formulation and execution of effective and creative strategies,  cost-sensitive case management,  and adherence to the highest professional standards.<BR><BR><P>Many of our cases require us to navigate undeveloped and uncertain areas of law and fact. Last year,  for example,  in a case presenting novel questions of commodities law pertinent to foreign currency derivatives trading,  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a substantial trial court judgment that we had obtained for our client,  a subsidiary of Salomon Brothers. <B>Eugene Gulland </B>and<B> William Iverson</B>,  who took the lead in that litigation,  have each handled many major litigation matters in the antitrust and securities fields.<BR>
<BR>
<P>In the intellectual property area,  we have filed pathbreaking lawsuits to curb the importation of gray market goods. On behalf of Parfums Givenchy,  we recently obtained a Ninth Circuit affirmance of an injunction barring such imports under the copyright laws. Our wide-ranging intellectual property practice has also included recent trial representations of AT &T,  the American Petroleum Institute,  the National Football League,  and Sun Life of Canada. <B>Charles Buffon</B>,  who has substantial experience in various areas of commercial litigation,  leads the firm's intellectual property litigation practice.<BR><BR><P>The firm's ability to operate in uncharted areas and successfully to take major cases to trial is evidenced by our pioneering representation of corporate policyholders in lawsuits against their insurance carriers. <B>Robert Sayler</B>,  who recently served as chair of the ABA's Section of Litigation,  was lead trial counsel for Armstrong World Industries in the California coordinated asbestos insurance coverage litigation,  said to be the lengthiest civil trial in United States history. The firm's success at the trial of that case was replicated when we later obtained for Boeing the first jury verdict for a major corporate insured in an environmental insurance coverage case. The successes of the firm in this area have steadily mounted,  and include victories in trials and arbitrations,  as well as through highly favorable settlements.<BR>
<BR><P>Our track record in more traditional areas of litigation is equally strong. <B>Peter Nickles</B>, <B> Herbert Dym</B>,  and<B> Joanne Grossman</B>,  whose work reflects the breadth of the firm's litigation practice,  have substantial experience defending complex toxic tort and product liability cases,  including cases pursued as class actions or on a coordinated basis. <B>Bruce Baird</B>,  who headed the securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney's office in New York City,  is a mainstay of the firm's criminal and securities fraud practices. <B>Jeffrey Huvelle</B>,  who secured a jury verdict for the defense earlier this year in a race discrimination lawsuit against the World Football League,  also represents IBM and other companies throughout the country in employment cases.<BR>
<BR><P><B>Bobby Burchfield</B> and<B> Mark Lynch</B>,  whose litigation practices span numerous subject-matter areas,  recently played leading roles in the firm's successful efforts to extricate National Medical Enterprises from a maze of civil lawsuits and criminal investigations. <B>Arvid Roach</B>,  whose roster of litigation clients includes Union Pacific,  has an impressive array of successes in transportation and pension-related matters. Finally,  while many of the firm's trial lawyers are experienced appellate advocates,  <B>Edward Bruce</B> is widely recognized for his work in appeals courts throughout the country and in the Supreme Court.<BR>
<BR><P><B>Gregg Levy</B>,  whose antitrust work has included recent victories for the National Football League,  and <B>Mitchell Dolin</B>,  who represents Exxon and other policyholders in insurance coverage lawsuits,  coordinate the firm's 150-lawyer litigation practice group and are available to provide additional information.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>F</B>ounded in 1910,  Gardner,  Carton  & Douglas is a Chicago-based,  full-service corporate law firm with one-third of its lawyers in the litigation area.<BR><BR>
<P><I>Business Litigation and Regulatory</I> Gardner,  Carton  & Douglas attorneys have litigated business disputes of virtually every type,  including cases arising from business transactions between small private companies and disputes involving multinational conglomerates. We have represented clients in actions involving banks,  brokerage houses,  natural resources developers,  manufacturers,  utilities,  and service providers. These cases have included complex contract claims,  the Uniform Commercial Code,  business torts,  breaches of fiduciary duty,  fraud and thefts of trade secrets,  product liability,  breaches of warranty,  antitrust,  RICO,  securities,  dealer termination claims,  and claims under state fair trade laws. We also have extensive experience at all levels of regulatory enforcement and in multijurisdictional enforcement actions.<BR><BR><P><I>Antitrust Litigation</I> The firm's experience includes every area of antitrust litigation. Our antitrust trial lawyers defend government criminal antitrust cases and conduct civil treble-damage litigation for plaintiffs and defendants. Clients call on us to respond to Justice Department,  Federal Trade Commission,  and other government investigations into industry behavior; we defend individuals and corporations facing grand jury antitrust investigations. We also advise clients on antitrust considerations in all types of business relations,  including mergers,  acquisitions,  tender offers,  and joint ventures,  and we defend corporations in government merger challenges. We have represented both sides in antitrust class actions,  and have tried antitrust injunction cases to courts and damages cases to juries throughout the country. Leaders in the health care antitrust bar,  our attorneys have tried three of the six hospital merger challenges brought to trial by the Department of Justice and the FTC. We brought the first and only successful plaintiff's antitrust case to block a merger of competing hospitals.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Health Care Litigation</I> We handle virtually every sort of adversarial proceeding for hospitals,  HMOs,  physicians,  treatment centers,  health care providers,  and support services across the country. We have successfully defended merging hospitals and HMOs,  and have defended hospitals against claims brought by medical staff.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Securities and Financial Products and Services Litigation</I> The firm has litigated securities issues under all major federal securities laws.

We have successfully represented clients before regulatory agencies,  state and federal courts,  securities and futures exchanges,  and in options arbitration. Our practice includes securities,  commodity futures and options,  oil and gas ventures,  limited partnerships,  and other investments.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Environmental Litigation</I> We conduct environmental litigation of all types at both the state and federal levels,  and in enforcement actions and Superfund proceedings.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Employment Litigation</I> The firm represents clients in employment litigation ranging from major class actions before the U.S. Supreme Court to suits involving individual employees and claims of discrimination,  libel,  defamation,  breach of contract,  torts,  and breach of noncompetition and confidentiality agreements.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution</I> We have extensive experience in domestic and international arbitration forums,  including the International Chamber of Commerce,  arbitration forums for all financial markets,  AAA arbitration,  mediated disputes,  and alternative forums.

<P>
<P><B>H</B>oyle,  Morris  & Kerr has both a local and national litigation practice that includes the broad spectrum of commercial litigation. Our clients range from small and mid-size businesses to Fortune 500 and multinational corporations in a wide variety of industries. Our litigation experience includes traditional commercial subjects such as securities,  antitrust,  breach of contract,  unfair competition,  and employment discrimination,  as well as the increasingly pervasive issues of toxic torts,  products liability,  environmental issues,  ERISA,  RICO,  and insurance coverage.<BR>
<P>We are especially well versed in complex litigation,  including class actions,  matters before the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation,  and management of nationwide products liability litigation. Our practice in both simple and complex litigation includes experience at both trial and appellate levels,  including practice before the United States Supreme Court.<BR><P>Recognizing that most companies prefer to avoid litigation,  we provide our clients with counsel and advice concerning resolution of problems outside the judicial system. When major litigation is necessary,  however,  our firm has an excellent track record. The firm has obtained numerous favorable jury verdicts in cases tried in state or federal courts not only in Pennsylvania,  where the firm is located,  but also in numerous other courts. By way of example,  we have obtained a jury verdict covering $101 million of insurance following trial in the Southern District of New York; a defense verdict in a securities class action litigated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; and a defense verdict in a contract interpretation dispute. We also obtained defense verdicts in the first two asbestos property damage cases ever tried to juries and continued to earn a successful win-loss record in that litigation.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>T</B>he practice of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes  & Lerach focuses on complex litigation,  with an emphasis on prosecution of civil actions for securities violations,  accountants' misconduct,  and breach of duty by corporate fiduciaries. Much of our work concentrates on representing plaintiffs in securities fraud cases,  both for private clients and as lead counsel in class actions. We also take on significant antitrust,  commercial and consumer fraud,  toxic and other health-related tort,  and environmental cases. We generally represent plaintiffs,  and have handled matters on contingency,  hourly,  and mixed-fee bases. We practice in federal and state courts throughout the country and have an active arbitration practice for complex disputes.<BR>
<BR><P>Recent cases in which the firm is playing or has played a lead or major role representing plaintiffs include the Washington Public Power Supply System securities litigation; the Keating-Lincoln Savings securities litigation; the FDIC's audit failure case against Ernst  & Young in Tennessee; securities litigation against Apple Computer; the Stringfellow toxic waste dump site environmental litigation; the Alaska oil spill litigation; and the City of San Jose's action against brokers and accountants involving investment of funds all of which have gone to trial in the last few years. In addition,  we have represented class plaintiffs in numerous major securities actions,  including the Drexel/Milken litigation (acting as co-counsel with Cravath,  Swaine  & Moore,  which represented the FDIC and RTC in those matters); have acted as counsel for bankruptcy estates or trustees in such major corporate failures as Phar-Mor,  Inc. and Colonial Realty Co. in actions against their former accountants; and represent plaintiffs in antitrust actions in the beer and prescription drug industries. We are also co-counsel for IBM in defending securities fraud actions. We have been lead counsel in class actions with aggregate recoveries for plaintiffs in excess of $4 billion.<BR><BR><P>In addition to our class action work,  we represent private clients in most of our practice areas. For example:<BR>
<UL><BR><LI> We have frequently represented substantial stock purchasers and acquiring companies in asserting securities fraud and related claims against issuers,  sellers,  and accounting firms. Occasionally we also take on defense work in those areas.<BR>
<BR><LI> We have represented minority owners of significant business enterprises in disputed control,  transactional,  and takeover situations.<BR>
<BR><LI> Due to our familiarity with accounting issues,  we have represented plaintiffs asserting malpractice and fraud claims arising out of failed audits,  acquisition reviews,  and related matters. <BR>
<BR><LI> We take on significant claims against brokers and other fiduciaries,  including complex churning,  unsuitability,  and other investment matters and breach of fiduciary duty cases against corporate trustees and others.<BR>
<BR><LI> We represent private clients asserting claims,  often involving price-fixing or price discrimination,  in complex antitrust litigations.<BR>
</UL><BR><P>The practice of all of our litigation attorneys generally extends over the firm's entire fields of representation,  without significant further specialization. The resulting flexibility in attorney staffing of cases,  and our background in prosecuting cases for plaintiffs,  often on a contingent basis,  mean that we use the 'leanest' approach possible,  consistent with achieving superior results,  in litigating our cases.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Melvyn I. Weiss</B> (<I>New York</I>) is the firm's senior partner and co-founder. He was co-lead counsel in the WPPSS securities litigation,  where class plaintiffs recovered in excess of $800 million; is lead negotiator for major securities claimants in Drexel/Milken matters; and is lead settlement counsel in the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> oil spill litigation,  among his many involvements in major cases. He is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and was named as one of the `100 Most Influential Attorneys' by the <I>National Law Journal</I> in 1994 and one of the `100 Most Influential People in Accounting' by <I>Accounting Today</I> in 1994. <B>William S. Lerach</B> (<I>San Diego</I>) is senior managing partner in the San Diego office. He leads the prosecution of numerous securities class actions and is heavily involved in litigation against the tobacco industry. He was named as one of the `100 Most Influential Attorneys' by the <I>National Law Journal</I> in 1994 and is a master of the American Inns of Court. He has served as a lawyer-delegate to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference and is a member of the California Senate Commission on Corporate Governance and Stockholders' Rights. <B>David J. Bershad</B> (<I>New York</I>) is managing partner in the New York office.

Hynes</B> (<I>New York</I>) was executive assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before joining the firm,  and has the most extensive trial experience among our senior partners. She is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and is active in trials and arbitrations across our fields of practice. All of our partners also have significant involvement in policy-oriented and educational work in our fields.<BR><BR>

<P><B>T</B>he Paul,  Weiss Litigation Department handles every kind of dispute resolution device recognized by the law,  from traditional court cases to domestic and international arbitrations,  from alternative dispute resolution processes to administrative tribunals of all kinds. We recognize that the possible end result of every case is a trial,  and our management of each case,  particularly the pretrial process,  is based upon that assumption. We also recognize that litigation costs can be substantial,  and carefully manage our cases to ensure that costs remain under control.<BR><P>We try cases and handle appeals in state and federal courts throughout the United States and its territories,  and we supervise and manage transnational litigation for clients needing centralized strategy for cases pending in foreign jurisdictions. We believe that mastery of the trial and appellate process,  in whatever form and before whatever tribunal,  is the key to successful litigation. We recognize that while procedures vary before administrative agencies,  arbitration panels,  private institutional tribunals,  legislative investigations,  and different courts,  the process is essentially the same: to identify facts that support our client's position,  to resolve disputed facts in its favor,  and to identify and apply the existing doctrines of law and to create new ones that support its position.<BR><P>Our practice and experience encompass complex cases of all kinds. We have handled securities,  corporate,  and intellectual property matters; criminal and civil RICO matters; communications matters involving over-the-air and cable television,  motion pictures,  music recording and publishing,  theater,  and home audio and video taping; defective product and product liability cases; grand jury investigations and criminal trials involving diverse issues ranging from the employment practices of a state legislative body to securities fraud,  insider trading,  and tax evasion; libel and defamation,  trade libel,  and corporate defamation and disparagement cases; major tax cases; real estate valuation matters; takeover litigations for bidders,  targets,  and financial advisors; copyright royalty disputes,  including the fees to be paid by radio and television stations for the use of copyrighted material; cases involving title to art that disappeared in World War II; and constitutional litigation of all kinds. Many of these cases were referred to us by former adversaries or other law firms who recognized the quality and breadth of our litigation capacity.<BR><P>One of our most dramatic recent victories involved our retention by Armstrong World Industries for the retrial of an antitrust,  breach of contract,  and tortious interference action. The first trial had resulted in a $239 million jury verdict for the plaintiff,  a producer of a video magazine for flooring retailers. After a successful appeal,  we handled the six-month retrial,  at the conclusion of which the jury awarded the plaintiff nothing.<BR><P>In an era of the `big case, ' we have maintained our capacity to handle not only the big cases,  but cases of different sizes,  in a cost-effective way.<BR><P>Below we highlight certain of our litigation practice areas:<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Intellectual Property</H3></CENTER>

<BR><BR>
<P>Paul,  Weiss has one of the leading intellectual property practices in the United States. It is far-reaching and diverse.<BR><P><I>Copyright/Entertainment Matters</I> In part due to our renowned Entertainment Department the largest and most active of any general practice firm in New York our litigators have for many years represented leading motion picture,  Broadway,  and off-Broadway producers,  as well as a wide variety of authors,  directors,  composers,  lyricists,  music publishers,  and performing artists in judicial,  administrative,  and arbitration proceedings across the country.<BR>
<BR><P>In recent years,  our litigators have represented subsidiaries of our client Time Warner Inc. in the successful renewal of their Manhattan cable television franchises; won summary judgment for Eddie Murphy,  Richard Pryor,  and Paramount Pictures in a copyright infringement action; brought several successful suits to enforce Lucasfilms' rights in the `Indiana Jones' character; successfully represented the National Music Publishers Association in proceedings before the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to establish an industry-wide royalty rate; handled several suits involving copyright infringement claims relating to computer software; argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent landmark case defining the applicability of the `fair use' doctrine to parody; successfully defended Michael Jackson,  owner of the copyrights to the Beatles' songs,  in a suit by a company that claimed it had acquired the rights to create rap versions of the Beatles' songs; and are presently defending against copyright infringement allegations as to the <I>Regarding Henry</I> and <I>Star Trek</I> motion pictures.<BR>
<BR><P><I> Patents and Trade Secrets</I> In recent years,  we handled major litigations and related settlement negotiations for a large Japanese company that was simultaneously asserting rights under its U.S. patents and defending against claims that it had infringed its competitors' U.S. patents; represented a Japanese corporation in a successful action to invalidate a U.S. competitor's patent; and secured an unprecedented summary determination of noninfringement in a Section 337 patent proceeding before the International Trade Commission. In a recent case of first impression,  we successfully defended a major medical research institution against a claim by former employees under a royalty-sharing provision of the U.S. Patent Law.<BR>
<BR><P>We advise clients regularly on the protection of trade secrets and have successfully litigated numerous trade secret claims. We have defended a major European manufacturer against a claim that it misappropriated jet engine technology; obtained injunctive relief to prevent a client's competitor from misappropriating computer technology; obtained injunctive relief on behalf of a major U.S. company barring key computer personnel from joining a rival firm; and successfully prosecuted or defended many actions,  often on an expedited basis,  to enforce confidentiality agreements and restrictive covenants in the merger and acquisition and employment contexts.<BR>
<BR><P><I> Trademarks,  Unfair Competition,  and Advertising</I> We have successfully: defeated a preliminary injunction motion to attempt to block the launch of Revlon's new fragrance `Charlie Red' on the ground that it infringed Giorgio Beverly Hills' trademark in the fragrance `Red'; prosecuted claims on behalf of the owner of the trademark `Bayer' for aspirin and other products in the United States; represented a foreign manufacturer in a lengthy arbitration against a former U.S. distributor,  which asserted various Lanham Act and other claims; defended a beer manufacturer in an action brought over its use of the word `Lite'; prosecuted trademark claims to enforce the `At-a-Glance' trademarks; represented the producers of the play <I>Six Degrees of Separation</I> in defeating right to privacy and right of publicity claims; and represented Castrol Inc. in a series of matters halting various false or misleading advertisements of its competitors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Securities and Commodities</H3></CENTER>

<P>From the beginning of the current era of securities regulation,  the firm has been involved in some of the most important civil and criminal securities cases,  including the first private action under the Williams Act (<I>Chris-Craft </I>v.<I> Piper</I>); landmark decisions defining a `security' (<I>United Housing </I>v.<I> Forman</I>) and a `tender offer' (<I>Wellman </I>v. <I>Dickinson</I>); the lengthy SEC investigation that culminated in <I>SEC </I>v.<I> Gulf  & Western</I>; the takeover defense of Consolidated Goldfields; the successful criminal defense of <I>U.S. </I>v.<I> GAF Corporation</I>; and the massive civil and criminal investigations and suits involving Michael Milken. More recently,  we represented a major investment bank in one of the largest investment banker malpractice actions ever brought; represented the Special Committee of the Woolworth Corporation in connection with its investigation into reporting and accounting irregularities; obtained a $22.3 million judgment in the Delaware Court of Chancery in a tax sharing dispute; and obtained for American Express the dismissal of shareholder derivative litigation arising from the company's alleged disparagement of a competitor. We successfully represented Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. in a natural gas dispute,  the first `fast-track' arbitration under the auspices of the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce. We are also currently serving as counsel to a select committee investigating the governance structure of the NASD and the NASDAQ stock market.<BR><BR><P>We pride ourselves in the breadth and depth of the firm's capacity and proficiency in virtually every aspect of securities and commodities litigations,  arbitrations,  and investigations. Nearly all of our 30 litigation partners devote a major portion of their professional time to securities and commodities litigation. While the firm is frequently retained in high-stakes matters,  its lawyers' extensive experience in securities and commodities matters of all types enables the firm to serve its clients with uncommon efficiency.<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Products Liability</H3></CENTER>

<P>Paul,  Weiss has substantial experience and expertise in all phases of products liability litigation,  case management,  and counseling. We have recently represented manufacturers of asbestos products,  cigarettes,  medical products,  valves for nuclear power plants,  school buses,  and washing machines.<BR><P>We have advised a major corporation in the coordination of its defense of asbestos cases across the country and negotiated its membership in the Asbestos Claims Facility. We also represent future asbestos health claimants with respect to the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm also represents a large manufacturer of medical and hospital equipment in a series of cases across the country brought by individuals who claim to have contracted AIDS as a result of their use of our client's products.<BR>
<BR><P>Paul,  Weiss litigators have also been active in litigation assessing governmental responsibility for damages in products liability cases.<BR>

<P><B>T</B>he lawyers in the litigation practice at Seyfarth,  Shaw,  Fairweather  & Geraldson represent clients in state and federal courts in the United States,  including appellate matters before the U.S. Supreme Court,  in certain foreign forums,  and in domestic and international arbitration proceedings.
<P><BR><P>Our litigation experience includes trial and appellate representation in virtually every area of commercial and civil litigation,  including business contract disputes,  securities and commodities law,  corporations and partnerships,  insurance and reinsurance coverage and claims disputes,  white collar crime,  intellectual property,  bankruptcy and creditors' rights,  environmental,  safety and health law,  product liability,  general torts and workers' compensation,  real estate,  construction law,  government contracts,  antitrust law and unfair competition,  professional malpractice,  trust and probate,  administrative law,  tax,  admiralty and maritime law,  and appellate practice.<BR><P>The success of our representation is dependent both on the results we achieve and the overall satisfaction of our clients. To ensure that both of these goals are accomplished,  our approach to dispute resolution includes thoroughly preparing cases for trial; promptly reporting all litigation developments; adopting competitive rates; monitoring expenses carefully throughout the litigation process; tailoring case preparation to match case value; trying cases aggressively; formulating fresh approaches to persistent problems; and utilizing the national resources of the Firm to achieve economic and successful results.<BR>
<BR><P>Though the Firm believes in vigorous advocacy on behalf of our clients,  we have found in recent years that mediation,  arbitration,  and other forms of alternative dispute resolution have proved to be effective and economical in resolving certain disputes for our clients. Our attorneys have been extensively involved in mediations,  arbitrations,  summary trials,  and minitrials encompassing most substantive areas of civil litigation. Our lawyers have also acted as mediators and arbitrators.<BR>
<BR><P>Seyfarth Shaw is also a subscriber to the policies of the Center for Public Resources,  a not-for-profit organization that fosters alternative dispute resolution.

<BR><P>Our areas of litigation practice include antitrust,  securities,  banking,  mergers and acquisitions,  employment relations and employment discrimination,  ERISA,  communications,  trademark and unfair competition,  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),  contracts,  lender liability,  environmental,  state and local taxation,  construction,  eminent domain,  defamation,  and real estate.<BR>

We provide assistance in virtually every major legal discipline to a wide range of clients throughout the United States and abroad,  including governments and governmental entities,  Fortune 500 companies,  and major commercial and financial institutions,  as well as individuals and small and midsize companies.

We have tried cases in federal district courts and many state courts throughout the country,  and have argued appeals in each of the circuits of the U.S. Court of Appeals and in the U.S. Supreme Court. We also have appeared before special tribunals including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,  the U.S. Claims Court,  the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation,  and the U.S. Tax Court.<BR><P>We have tried essentially every type of lawsuit which might arise in the course of operating a sophisticated business,  including matters involving breach of contract,  common law fraud,  RICO,  mergers and acquisitions,  supply contract disputes,  breach of fiduciary duty,  lender liability,  federal and state securities laws,  bid award contests,  shareholder rights,  common law fraud,  condemnation,  mortgage foreclosure,  patent/copyright/trademark infringement,  antitrust,  dealer termination,  commodities fraud,  international trade,  product liability,  licensing agreements,  bankruptcy,  consumer fraud,  professional negligence,  construction,  and insurance coverage. Our lawyers also are experienced in state and federal court class action litigation,  including cases involving national consumer and shareholder classes.<BR>

We regularly are involved in a range of offerings in the U.S. capital markets,  including initial public offerings,  other primary offerings,  and secondary offerings,  as well as private placements. The public offerings involve equity securities,  debt securities,  and derivative products. Private placements include traditional private placements,  structured finance (monetization/securitization) transactions,  and Rule 144A offerings.
<P><BR><P>As the securities markets have become more globalized,  we have experienced significant growth in the range of activities that involve non-U.S. clients and non-U.S. capital markets. We have been involved in the establishment of American Depositary Receipt programs (including programs listed on a U.S. stock exchange or involving the raising of equity capital in the United States) and have represented issuers,  underwriters,  and placement agents in connection with offshore offerings under Regulation S. We also have been involved in the establishment of offshore investment funds and offerings by such funds of interest to U.S. and non-U.S. investors. We also represent Canadian issuers and underwriters in cross-border offerings under the multijurisdictional disclosure system. In addition,  we regularly advise foreign clients on a range of issues arising under the U.S. securities laws by virtue of their offshore activities.<BR><P>As part of our general representation of corporate clients that are public companies,  we regularly are involved in reviewing periodic reports and evaluating companies' disclosure obligations,  dealing with the staffs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and principal U.S. stock exchanges,  preparing or reviewing proxy statements,  and preparing or reviewing insider trading policies.<BR>
<BR><P>Although our corporate finance and securities expertise resides principally in the firm's Securities Group,  which is part of its corporate department,  transactions in this area often require an interdisciplinary approach. For example,  the structuring of initial public offerings by real estate investment trusts requires significant input from our tax and real estate departments. Structured finance transactions often require an analysis of tax and bankruptcy issues. Due diligence reviews in connection with a public offering or private placement may involve lawyers in our real estate,  litigation,  tax,  and bankruptcy departments and our environmental group.<BR>

<P><B>W</B>illkie Farr  & Gallagher engages in the general practice of law,  including the corporate and financial services,  bankruptcy and business reorganizations,  employee benefits and employee relations,  environmental,  intellectual property,  international trade,  legislative and governmental relations,  litigation,  real estate,  tax,  telecommunications,  and trusts and estates areas.
<P><BR><P>Our Corporate and Financial Services Group handles a wide variety of financial transactions. We offer clients broad expertise in all types of acquisition,  joint venture,  transaction financing,  and regulatory matters.<BR><P>With respect to mergers and acquisitions,  we have extensively and successfully represented bidders,  targets,  special committees of boards of directors,  debt and equity investors,  financial advisers,  and arbitrageurs in some of the most significant acquisitions of publicly traded companies. Our M &A practice includes contested takeover situations,  strategic industrial alliances,  leveraged buyouts,  and acquisitions from reorganization proceedings.<BR>
<BR><P>Our extensive experience in the area of public offerings includes all types of debt and equity securities by both U.S. and foreign issuers. We handle transactions of all sizes,  from issuances by seasoned public companies to initial public offerings of new entities,  and represent both underwriters and issuers in all fields of commerce and industry. Recent public offerings have involved a wide variety of industries,  including fiber optic telecommunications,  television broadcasting,  health care,  natural resources,  defense electronics,  and investment banking. We have also been significantly involved in offerings of real estate investment trusts.<BR>
<BR><P>We regularly assist a number of venture capital firms that provide seed money to start-up enterprises and make special equity investments in established enterprises such as health care,  biotechnology,  computers,  consumer products,  electronics,  publishing,  telecommunications,  and environmental cleanup and control. On numerous occasions,  we have represented enterprises from their start-up and venture capital stages through their eventual public offerings of securities and onward through further stages of financial development and growth by acquisitions.<BR>
<BR><P>We are routinely involved in a wide variety of important private placement transactions for which we advise several major U.S. institutional investors. These transactions take the forms of traditional and Rule 144A private placements,  both domestic and cross-border,  and include secured and unsecured note issues,  acquisition finance,  oil and gas finance (including production payments and reserved-based lending),  asset-backed finance,  leasing,  and project finance of assets and facilities as diverse as power plants,  pipelines,  aircraft,  satellites and transponders,  manufacturing plants,  resource recovery and cogeneration facilities,  and financial restructurings.<BR>
<BR><P>We represent a sizeable number of domestic and foreign money managers with total assets under management in excess of approximately $90 billion. We also assist investment advisers to both registered and exempt investment companies. We are experienced in dealing with the fiduciary and regulatory issues that are frequently involved in transactions governing the acquisition of investment management businesses and the reorganization of investment companies.<BR>
<BR><P>We have a substantial public finance practice directed to the issuance by governmental units and agencies of tax-exempt and taxable securities,  the proceeds of which are used to finance public projects such as power facilities,  state and local infrastructure,  housing,  airports,  colleges,  and hospitals. The firm represents approximately 65 percent of the issuers of municipal securities in the State of New York,  including most of its counties and fire districts,  villages,  school districts,  towns,  and special district corporations. In addition,  we serve as counsel to many of the country's larger underwriters (including,  in some instances,  banks) of tax-exempt bonds. The public finance group has been at the forefront of the development of municipal derivative products,  including inverse floating rate instruments,  auction rate securities,  and municipal securities involving explicit and implicit interest rate floors,  caps,  and swaps. It also represents governmental units and agencies through the United States,  with a special emphasis on New York State and the western United States.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm has a growing structured finance practice representing underwriters,  issuers,  and investors in publicly offered and privately placed mortgage-backed and asset-backed transactions. These cutting-edge financings involve a broad range of asset types from residential and commercial mortgages to auto and boat loans to equipment lease,  trade,  and health care receivables. The structured finance group is comprised of a team of attorneys with corporate,  securities,  real estate,  bankruptcy,  tax,  ERISA,  and secured lending expertise who actively seek those matters that require special effort because they are interdisciplinary and unique.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>T</B>he exclusive focus of Cutler  & Stanfield is on a national practice in environmental, land use,  and natural resources law. The firm was founded in 1988 by lawyers who believed that the increasing complexity of environmental law justified a firm's exclusive attention to those areas and that the firm's clients would be well-served by the breadth of experience and the depth of expertise that such a firm could provide. Cutler  & Stanfield has represented clients in a wide range of environmental matters in more than 30 states and several foreign countries.
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Experience</H3></CENTER>

<P>In addition to all significant federal and state statutory and regulatory regimes,  Cutler  & Stanfield's environmental practice embraces related matters such as the supervision of environmental audits of clients' operations and properties,  and the representation of U.S. government contractors concerning their environmental responsibilities and liabilities. The firm has undertaken the primary litigation responsibility in scores of environmental and related civil matters in state and federal trial and appellate courts throughout the United States. These cases have included the defense of the largest single enforcement action brought by the U.S. government under the Clean Water Act and other major multiparty and multiforum complex litigation under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes.<BR><P>Cutler  & Stanfield lawyers combine sophisticated legal skills with an understanding of government and politics which comes from direct,  personal experience. As a result,  the firm maintains an unusual and successful practice specialty in general representation,  negotiations,  and litigation concerning complex public sector undertakings. For example,  Cutler  & Stanfield lawyers negotiated an intergovernmental agreement for the development of the new Denver International Airport which the <I>Denver Post</I> said `nearly defies political gravity.'<BR>
<BR><P>Cutler  & Stanfield has represented a broad range of both large and small corporate and other private and commercial clients,  including Air Products and Chemicals,  Bechtel,  The Walt Disney Co.,  General Electric,  EG &G Rocky Flats,  Kaiser Resources,  Petro-Canada,  Revlon,  and Skanska AB. The firm's public sector clients have included the FDIC,  the State of Indiana,  the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority,  the City of Chicago,  the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority,  the California Institute of Technology,  and dozens of county and local governments.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>D</B>anaher,  Tedford,  Lagnese  & Neal is a medium-sized law firm in Hartford,  Connecticut which has established a national practice in the area of defensive toxic tort litigation.
<P><BR><P>The firm originated with a focus on complex litigation with strong ties to Connecticut. Over approximately the last 12 years,  it has expanded into a practice which involves both direct trial and appellate responsibility and litigation management on a national basis. The litigation management is conducted under the supervision of the firm's attorneys largely through a staff of paralegals and a network of local counsel. Historically,  much of this practice and experience has included not only the traditional litigation of individual cases,  but the management of such more recent phenomena as large class actions,  federal multidistrict proceedings,  repetitive punitive damages issues,  and claims regarding junk science. Over the years,  the firm's practice has been broadened to include numerous environmental and toxic tort matters,  such as cases involving asbestos,  solvents,  pesticides,  formaldehyde,  the disposal of nuclear waste,  breast implants,  and the Dalkon Shield. The firm's clients in these areas are both national and local corporations,  medical society risk management pools,  and a quasipublic state agency.<BR><P>The firm also has an insurance coverage practice related to environmental issues. This typically involves the representation of insurance companies in cases involving Superfund sites and groundwater contamination. It has also involved the representation of parties in other coverage matters such as DES litigation. Finally,  the firm has performed environmental litigation support services for Hartford insurers such as the retrieval and organization of documents for national discovery purposes.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm has a general practice in addition to the above environmental and toxic tort litigation concentration. This includes a corporate and commercial department which deals with environmental regulatory matters as part of its banking and real estate practice.<BR>

<P><B>R</B>oss  & Hardies,  a national business law firm founded in 1902,  has an established environmental practice grounded in thorough knowledge of environmental issues and laws,  longstanding experience in representation,  and sensitivity to clients' business goals and situations.
<P><BR><P>Two basic principles direct the Environmental Group of Ross  & Hardies. First,  Ross  & Hardies is client-oriented. It is the firm's responsibility to provide clients with the kind and amount of services they desire and to be responsive to their directions in terms of objectives,  deadlines,  reporting relationships,  and budget. Second,  Ross  & Hardies is solution-oriented. It is the firm's role to develop creative solutions to problems,  keep minor problems from becoming big ones,  and,  whenever possible,  prevent problems from occurring in the first place. While Ross  & Hardies is staffed for successful litigation,  the firm has found it is generally in the client's long-term best interest to seek early resolutions of issues and avoid protracted litigation. Attorneys' combined prior experience in government,  private practice,  and corporations help the Environmental Group to understand client needs as well as the business,  political,  and regulatory environment in which they operate. Ross  & Hardies develops solutions which are effective and cost-efficient without jeopardizing longstanding relationships with government agencies or the public.<BR>

<P>The makeup and experience of our Environmental Practice Group have put us in a strong position to respond to the concerns of industry and the financial community arising from environmental matters,  domestic and international.

<P>In the corporate context,  the major strengths of our Environmental Practice Group are: (1) advising buyers and sellers in acquisitions and divestitures where environmental risks must be identified and allocated; (2) representing lenders in financings and workouts where exposure to environmental costs and liabilities must be assessed,  quantified,  and integrated into the structure and price of the credit; and (3) representing parties in contested matters,  litigated proceedings,  and enforcement proceedings. Representative clients in these aspects of our work include American Cyanamid,  British Steel,  Chemical Bank,  Citibank,  Deere  & Co.,  Fort Howard Corp.,  Mennen,  Morgan Stanley,  Seagram,  and Viacom.<BR><P>On the regulatory front,  the focus of the Group's work has been (1) resolving environmental compliance,  permitting,  and enforcement issues (civil and criminal) for major industrial operators; and (2) designing,  negotiating,  and implementing large-scale site characterization and remediation programs under a variety of regulatory regimes in various locations around the United States. Major petroleum,  chemical,  and manufacturing businesses have been our clients in these areas.<BR>

The firm has counseled and defended clients on hazardous and other solid waste issues under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We have done substantial work under the Toxic Substances Control Act,  the Federal Insecticide,  Fungicide,  and Rodenticide Act,  and the National Environmental Policy Act.<BR><P>We have represented clients on state environmental law matters in more than 35 states.

<BR><P>Beyond dealing with regulatory issues,  Squire,  Sanders  & Dempsey has defended clients in numerous environmental toxic tort claims,  which seek to recover for personal injuries,  property damages,  and other harm arising out of alleged pollution. We draw upon strengths of our environmental,  litigation,  and corporate attorneys to present a coordinated defense in these cases,  which typically span several technical areas.<BR>

<P><B>H</B>all  & Evans has provided legal services since 1932,  representing our clients on the local through international levels in litigation,  commercial transactions,  and regulatory and legislative affairs. We deliver innovative solutions,  prompt dispute resolution,  and multi-dimensional legal strategies in a practical,  timely,  and cost-effective manner.
<P><BR><P>We have a significant employee benefit practice which includes the selection and preparation of welfare benefit plans and pension benefit plans and representing clients in their capacity as fiduciaries of plans subject to ERISA,  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our practice also addresses designing and implementing welfare benefit plans and qualified retirement plans as well as handling IRS and Department of Labor filings and representing clients in benefit disputes.<BR><P>The technical aspect of our practice includes working with clients in the selection and implementation of welfare benefit plans,  including cafeteria plans,  voluntary employees' beneficiary associations,  and qualified sick pay plans. With regard to compensation planning,  we work with our corporate,  governmental,  and non-profit clients in designing and implementing qualified and non-qualified retirement plans,  deferred compensation arrangements,  and qualified and non-qualified stock options as well as employee stock ownership plans.<BR>
<BR><P>There has been a tremendous growth in ERISA and other benefit-related litigation which is due,  in large part,  to the increasing number of significant decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts. Our attorneys assist clients in complying with statutes and regulations under the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA,  and also have defended ERISA plans and fiduciaries in federal and state court in Colorado,  Missouri,  New Mexico,  Texas,  and Utah. Cases we handle include issues of ERISA's preemption; matters concerning fiduciary obligations and breach of fiduciary duties; reporting and disclosure requirements under ERISA; MEWA-related claims; Department of Labor audits; wrongful denial of health,  disability,  life,  or accidental death benefits; and disputes regarding COBRA and conversion from group to individual benefits.<BR>
<BR><P>Representative clients include the AIG entities; The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies; Gemisys Trust Company; ITT Hartford; Lincoln Trust Company; Philadelphia American Life; Reliance National Insurance Company; Standard Insurance Company; and Trust Company of America.<BR>

We counsel on design opportunities and constraints under ERISA,  the Internal Revenue Code,  the securities laws,  nondiscrimination and other labor laws,  and bankruptcy. Our counsel ranges from highly technical assistance for major public corporations with sophisticated in-house expertise to comprehensive advice relating to plan design,  implementation,  and compliance for other clients.<BR><P>We also represent plan sponsors and fiduciaries in benefits-related litigation in the appellate and lower courts. Examples include defense of individual and class actions involving such issues as the modification of post-retirement health benefits,  or the termination of eligibility to grow into early retirement subsidies on the sale of a subsidiary,  and alleged fiduciary breaches; and representation of a variety of employers,  ranging from major public companies to closely held companies,  in multiemployer liability plan withdrawal disputes.<BR><BR><P>In addition to such corporate clients of the firm as Liz Claiborne,  Inc. and MCI,  special clients of the department who have retained us specifically for advice on benefits matters include: Arrow Electronics,  Inc.,  BTR Inc.,  Citicorp,  Collins  & Aikman Group,  Inc.,  Lehman Brothers,  Sony Theaters,  Marsh  & McLennan Companies,  Inc.,  Mobil Oil Corporation,  New York Life Insurance Company,  Philips Electronics North America Corporation,  PaineWebber,  Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.,  United States Trust Company,  United Technologies Corporation,  and Warner-Lambert Company.<BR><BR><P>Our expertise in the field also is recognized by other benefit specialists: our senior benefit partner often has been sought as an arbitrator in contested civil matters or as an expert witness (including by the U.S. Department of Labor,  which has recommended him as an expert witness on ERISA matters for the Comptroller of the Currency).<BR><BR><P><I>Transaction Counseling.</I> We act as special benefits counsel to management in corporate transactions and workouts. For example,  we advised the management of Praxair Inc. on benefit matters in its spin-off by Union Carbide Corporation; and we successfully defended the Air Micronesia-controlled joint venture against a $700 million claim asserted by the PBGC arising out of the Continental and Eastern bankruptcies,  and counseled on related issues in the restructuring of Air Micronesia into an independent airline.<BR><BR><P><I>Counsel to Institutions and Service Providers.</I> We also counsel brokerage and investment advisory clients with respect to the full range of ERISA and tax considerations associated with benefit plan investments and the furnishing of financial services to benefit plans (e.g.,  prohibited transaction,  unrelated business income,  `soft dollar' issues,  and group trust arrangements),  and with the use of prototype qualified plans and IRAs used in offering mutual funds and brokerage services.<BR><BR><P><I>Counsel to Plan Fiduciaries.</I> We represent plan fiduciaries in corporate transactions where the advice of independent counsel is required,  such as: the ESOP fiduciaries in the $2 billion ESOP leveraged buyout of Healthtrust Inc.-The Hospital Company from Hospital Corporation of America,  and in the subsequent refinancings and ESOP termination; the fiduciaries at Colt Industries in connection with its Savings Plan's receipt of different consideration than other stockholders in Colt's $1.6 billion leveraged recapitalization; Richardson-Vick's fiduciaries in connection with the buyout of its plan's stockholdings upon the acquisition of Richardson-Vicks by Procter  & Gamble; and the Macmillan ESOP trustees in connection with the proposed restructuring of Macmillan prior to its purchase by the Maxwell interests.<BR><BR><P>The benefits practice group is headed by Michael J.

<P><B>P</B>aul,  Weiss,  Rifkind,  Wharton  & Garrison is a globally oriented,  full-service firm. The firm's practice areas include a group of seven lawyers and one para-legal who work full time on all types of ERISA,  executive compensation,  and employee benefits matters. The department regularly provides general benefits advice to a number of major corporations,  both regular firm clients and also companies that have come to the firm specifically for that work. Typical client support includes assistance in the design,  installation,  and maintenance of broad-based plans and novel programs for key executives.
<P><BR><P>The benefits practice has included a great deal of transactional work,  such as dealing with the benefits issues connected with corporate takeovers and sales. Also,  the group has handled many nonrecurring work projects involving very difficult benefits problems,  such as handling the Senate and federal agency investigations into one client's purchase of annuities from the now-failed Executive Life Insurance Company.<BR><P>We routinely field questions involving ERISA's fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules. This work typically involves counseling for the plan sponsor or for the money manager. We have also handled fiduciary litigation and worked on a number of applications for exemption from ERISA's prohibited transaction rules. We have also represented clients whose plan management activities were under investigation by the Department of Labor.<BR>
<BR><P>Paul,  Weiss' ERISA group has also been involved in a considerable number of employee stock ownership (ESOP) transactions. For example,  we represented the United Airlines pilots in their historic multibillion-dollar effort to buy the airline through an ESOP,  and we represented the ESOP that successfully bought LTV's bar steel operations for the United Steelworkers. We have provided advice in several contests for corporate control where an ESOP figured prominently in defense strategy. For example,  we represented the Dan River textile company in connection with the ESOP established during its takeover battle with Carl Icahn,  and we represented the ESOP established by NCR following AT &T's acquisition overture. Together with our regular tax attorneys,  we have successfully worked on ESOPs in connection with corporate restructurings and tax-free sales of stock to ESOPs by individual stockholders.<BR>

<P>We work with clients to protect and enforce their trademarks and related proprietary rights in the courts and in administrative proceedings in the Patent and Trademark Office.

We coordinate undercover investigations for our clients,  obtain seizure orders under the Anti-Counterfeiting Act,  and execute those seizure orders at retail and wholesale establishments,  factories,  flea markets,  and on the streets of major cities throughout the United States. We coordinate investigations,  seizures,  and resulting criminal prosecutions in most countries in the Far East. Our experienced anti-counterfeiting attorneys regularly work with law enforcement agencies,  and conduct and participate in anticounterfeiting seminars before such agencies.<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Intellectual Property Aspects of Business Negotiations (Licensing,  Mergers,  Acquisitions,  Financing)</H3></CENTER>

<P>In all areas of intellectual property,  we represent licensors and licensees by preparing,  negotiating,  and administering licenses from the simple to the complex in both domestic and international business ventures. Our licensing work includes providing both legal and business-related advice to our clients based on our years of experience in the licensing field.<BR><P>Our firm provides legal services and renders opinions to clients engaged in merger and acquisition activities,  including buyers,  sellers,  and financial institutions,  relative to intellectual property rights which often form the `collateral' for such transactions. We conduct due diligence and intellectual property audits,  negotiate the sale of businesses,  and participate in the preparation of agreements. We have assisted clients in the disposition and acquisition of assets overseen by the bankruptcy courts and have advised clients in the bankruptcy area relative to intellectual property assets.<BR>

<P>Collier Shannon's Intellectual Property practice is nationwide in scope. We handle all types of intellectual property issues (patent,  trademark,  copyright,  trade secret,  and related licensing matters) in a wide variety of domestic and international settings and,  in particular,  where international or trade regulation issues are also involved.<BR><P>We represent clients before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in connection with patent and trademark applications,  reexaminations,  reissues,  appeals,  petitions to the Commissioner,  and recording marks with the U.S. Customs Service.<BR>
<BR><P>We also represent clients before numerous U.S. district courts,  U.S. courts of appeals,  the U.S. Supreme Court,  and the International Trade Commission in connection with patent,  trademark,  copyright,  and/or related unfair competition and antitrust claims.<BR>
<BR><P>We encourage our clients to approach their intellectual property assets strategically. We attempt to resolve our clients' intellectual property needs effectively and efficiently,  avoiding litigation whenever possible. If litigation becomes necessary,  we provide the caliber,  depth,  and breadth of litigation resources that only a general practice firm can provide. We have been involved in some of the ground-breaking property issues,  including one of the first litigated cases involving the Grandfather Clause of the Process Patent Amendments Act of 1987,  and a leading case involving the <I>Noerr-Pennington</I> exception to the antitrust laws in the context of copyright infringement claim.<BR>

The firm's litigation practice is available to our clients as a last resort in resolving disputes. We,  of course,  make every effort to find ways to obviate the time-consuming process of litigation. However,  when litigation is required,  our clients receive the best talent available along with a strong commitment to handling litigation matters in a cost-effective and business-oriented manner.<BR>
<BR><P>Our recent litigation results are extremely favorable to the affected clients. For example,  we succeeded in defeating a motion for preliminary injunction in a multi-million-dollar claim for alleged misappropriation of tantalum production trade secrets. Recently,  the plaintiff dismissed with prejudice its case against our client in light of the proofs adduced and the result obtained at the preliminary injunction hearing.<BR>
<BR><P>Also,  in a recent patent infringement jury trial,  the jury found in favor of our client,  an accused infringer,  and the jury's verdict was affirmed on appeal. In the current atmosphere of large dollar damage awards in patent jury trials,  we are especially pleased with this result. Similarly,  in a recent patent infringement jury trial for the patent owner,  the jury found in favor of our client,  resulting in an immediate $3 million settlement without right of appeal.<BR>
<BR><P>We have also obviated a jury trial on behalf of an accused infringer by successfully obtaining a summary judgment determination of noninfringement.<BR>
<BR><P>With attorneys having degrees in such areas as chemistry,  chemical and nuclear engineering,  biotechnology,  and government/political sciences,  as well as doctorates in physiology,  microbiology,  organic chemistry,  and immunology,  the firm is uniquely suited to serving clients in the health care area.<BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI><B>Martin L. Katz</B> is the firm's managing partner. Mr. Katz works with clients in the chemical and pharmaceutical areas and has served as patent counsel for two large drug companies.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Thomas C. Northrup </B>earned his doctorate and practices in the biotech/chemical group; he has expertise in areas ranging from drugs to monoclonal antibodies and genetically engineered plants.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Paul M. Vargo</B> earned his doctorate and taught in electronics and computer systems; his practice includes advising high-tech based clients on computer hardware and software.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>John P. Milnamow</B> leads the mechanical arts practice group and has particular expertise in absorbent product technology and counseling large corporate clients.<BR>

<P>Howrey  & Simon built its reputation around its capabilities of taking the largest and most complex cases to trial. In the process,  we have developed one of the largest groups of experienced counsel dedicated to litigation in the United States. The intellectual property group is an integral part of our litigation practice.<BR><BR><P>Howrey  & Simon represents clients in patent,  trademark,  copyright,  unfair competition,  trade secret,  and other intellectual property disputes in federal and state courts as well as in contested proceedings before administrative agencies such as the U.S. Patent  & Trademark Office (PTO). Utilizing a `team' approach to staff intellectual property,  and particularly patent,  matters,  we combine the skills of experienced litigators and intellectual property lawyers,  as well as draw on our in-house expertise for economic and accounting skills in the damages phases of litigation. Howrey  & Simon's operations are state-of-the-art in the use of computer-based document management and imaging techniques for both day-to-day case management and at trial.<BR>
<BR><P>Our group handles litigation in all areas of technology,  including complex electronic and computer matters,  pharmaceuticals,  and chemical arts. We have a dynamic biotechnology practice,  headed up by a patent lawyer who is also a Ph.D. molecular biologist.<BR>
<BR><P>Howrey  & Simon lawyers have participated in over 55 of the approximately 350 proceedings before the International Trade Commission under Section 337 in which intellectual property issues have formed the basis for a claim of unfair trade practices. We also have expertise in all areas of trademark litigation,  including Lanham Act actions,  gray market goods,  and proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board.<BR>
<BR><P>Howrey  & Simon has advised clients including,  among others,  technology companies in over 100 domestic and international mergers,  acquisitions,  joint ventures,  and tender offers as well as in the intellectual property matters associated with these transactions. This representation includes advocacy practice and negotiations with the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to obtain clearance of such transactions,  and defending challenges to such transactions filed by a governmental agency or a private party.<BR>
<BR><P>Howrey  & Simon is a leader in the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques,  particularly in intellectual property disputes. Our experience and expertise in ADR enables us to offer clients a complete range of methods for resolving cases in lieu of,  or as a complement to,  traditional litigation. We have successfully used ADR methods as an adjunct to litigation,  resolving specific issues or claims to narrow the disputes in litigation and reduce litigation costs. Our experience enables us to tailor the ADR method to the particular case to achieve the most efficient,  economical,  and effective resolution.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>F</B>ounded 75 years ago,  Kaye,  Scholer has one of the largest litigation practices in the country and is well recognized in the fields of intellectual property litigation,  antitrust law,  and licensing. The firm was a pioneer among general practice firms in intellectual property litigation. Its involvement in patent litigation,  for instance,  goes back 20 years to the landmark patent-antitrust suit over Xerox's patents in the copier industry,  which culminated in the firm's successful defense of Xerox in the longest federal civil jury trial to date.
<P><BR><P>Kaye,  Scholer's practice covers all major areas of intellectual property litigation. The firm's Patent Group,  for example,  represents clients in diverse industries in high-profile patent litigation as well as in non-litigated matters requiring counseling and the rendering of opinions. Biotechnology,  pharmaceuticals,  medical devices,  fibers,  electronics,  and aerospace are among the industries for which Kaye,  Scholer regularly litigates patent matters. The firm has prosecuted ten multidistrict patent infringement actions on behalf of leading worldwide pharmaceutical and medical device companies relating to cardiovascular drugs,  and numerous other matters involving electronic air traffic control systems,  gyroscopes,  and plastic fibers. Among the Group's successes is a landmark case in which the firm prevailed in the longest biotechnology patent infringement trial to date. The firm also handles extensive patent opinion work; patent interference and reexamination proceedings; technology-based licensing and joint venture agreements; and related distribution and franchising arrangements. Many group members have degrees in engineering or the sciences and are admitted to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The firm also counsels clients on the selection and use of trademarks,  prosecutes their state and federal trademark applications,  and regularly appears before the PTO in opposition and cancellation proceedings. In addition,  the firm has experience in advertising challenges before the National Advertising Division of the Council of the Better Business Bureau.<BR><P>The firm also litigates major trademark,  trade dress,  and false advertising matters for leading companies in a wide range of industries,  including cosmetics,  pharmaceuticals,  chemicals,  apparel,  food,  and luggage. Illustrative cases include the defense of Rhone-Poulenc,  Rorer,  Inc. in a false advertising suit over antacid products; the defense of a leading food manufacturer in false advertising suits concerning breakfast foods; and the representation of a major oil company in NAD proceedings. Kaye,  Scholer is also active in litigating copyright matters for members of the publishing industry and has represented Art Buchwald in his successful suit concerning the use of his idea for the movie <I>Coming to America</I>.<BR>

On behalf of the Montgomery County Association of Realtors,  Inc.,  the Firm convinced the U.S. District Court of the District of Maryland that a computer database containing real estate listings possessed a degree of creativity and was,  therefore,  copyrightable. On behalf of American Home Products,  the Firm successfully enjoined a major competitor from using the client's patented oral contraceptive. In another recent case,  Kenyon  & Kenyon successfully defended Toyota and a number of other prominent automobile importers against a highly publicized,  but eccentric,  windshield wiper inventor who had previously won multimillion-dollar verdicts from Ford and Chrysler. On behalf of Oscar Mayer,  the Firm obtained a $10 million jury verdict and an injunction against ConAgra on patents concerning food additives. Kenyon  & Kenyon also recently won a precedent-setting case for Lever Brothers against the U.S. Customs Service in which goods made by a foreign affiliate were barred from importation because they were physically different from the identically marked U.S. goods.<BR>

<P><B>M</B>iddleton  & Reutlinger (M &R) is a full-service law firm which traces its roots back to 1854. In 1985,  M &R began its Intellectual Property Practice Group,  and integrated it into the Firm. Today,  M &R's Intellectual Property Group is the largest in a multi-state region. M &R practices the full range of intellectual property and unfair competition law.
<P><BR><P>Our Patent Group (presently five registered patent attorneys) includes practitioners with electrical engineering,  chemical engineering,  ceramic engineering,  and computer science degrees. The Patent Group regularly prepares and prosecutes patent applications before the U.S. Patent  & Trademark Office (PTO) in all major examining groups mechanical,  electrical,  chemical,  computer,  etc. In addition,  our Computer Science Group is fully up-to-date on the fast-breaking field of patent protection for computer programs. And,  with our web of world-wide associate firms,  our clients can receive protection for their inventions in every corner of the world.<BR><P>Our Trademark Group performs the full function of trademark practice clearance counseling,  prosecution in the PTO,  oppositions,  cancellations,  licensing,  franchising,  etc. And,  with our own proprietary docket control program,  we assist our clients in maintaining the longevity of their trademarks. We currently assist many clients in management or their worldwide trademark programs,  such as the famous Louisville Slugger &#174; mark.<BR>
<BR><P>Our Literary/Entertainment Rights Group regularly counsels authors,  entertainers,  and literary agents in obtaining,  exploiting,  and enforcing copyright and right of publicity rights. Among our current clients are an author whose book is being made into a major motion picture,  and The Memphis Mafia,  who are on a nationwide tour with their book reminiscing on their many years with Elvis Presley. Our past clients have included The Grateful Dead &#174; and perhaps Louisville's most famous contemporary citizen,  Muhammad Ali.<BR>
<BR><P>Our Litigation Group is active in technology/intellectual property matters. We practice all types of infringement litigation patent,  trademark,  copyright,  trade secret,  and computers regionally,  and nationwide.

<P><B>P</B>aul,  Weiss,  Rifkind,  Wharton  & Garrison's intellectual property practice is far-reaching and diverse,  from the defense of a major Japanese electronics firm accused of theft of computer secrets to the championing of copyright in Charlie Chaplin's films,  from the creation of a trademark trust for a renowned designer to the licensing of performance rights for Cole Porter's tunes. Our clients range from struggling playwrights to media giants,  from individual composers to the country's largest performing rights society,  from entrepreneurs to established industrial corporations.
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Copyrights</H3></CENTER>

<P>Paul,  Weiss has extensive experience in mergers and acquisitions,  financings,  and licensing matters involving copyright (and other intellectual property) assets,  including motion picture,  television,  cable,  music,  stage,  and publishing rights,  and computer software. The firm has litigated many landmark cases,  from the seminal case of <I>Arnstein </I>v.<I> Porter</I>,  which established the standards of proof for copyright infringement,  to <I>CBS </I>v.<I> ASCAP</I>,  in which the Supreme Court upheld ASCAP's blanket licensing system for copyrighted musical works. In recent years,  we have successfully prosecuted and defended numerous copyright infringement actions,  involving the `Indiana Jones' character,  Star Trek &#174;,  and other copyrighted properties.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Patents and Trade Secrets</H3></CENTER>

<P>We have assisted clients in a broad spectrum of patent and trade secret matters (litigation,  acquisitions,  and licensing) involving numerous technical and scientific disciplines. In the litigation arena,  we have in recent years prosecuted and defended patent infringement claims in diverse fields; defended a major European manufacturer against a claim (ultimately settled) that it misappropriated jet engine technology; obtained injunctive relief to prevent a client's competitor from misappropriating computer know-how; and secured an unprecedented summary determination of noninfringement in a patent proceeding before the International Trade Commission.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Trademarks,  Unfair Competition,  and Advertising</H3></CENTER>

<P>We have litigated countless trademark,  unfair competition,  and advertising disputes over the years. In recent years,  for example,  we have successfully defended one of the nation's largest tobacco companies in a nine-month jury trial involving trademark,  unfair competition,  and antitrust claims; and prosecuted trademark,  unfair competition,  and related claims with respect to the use of the trademark Bayer &#174; in the United States. On behalf of our client Castrol Inc.,  we obtained injunctions halting national advertising campaigns of Quaker State and Pennzoil on the grounds that they were false and misleading. We have handled major transactions involving many renowned trademarks.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Intellectual Property Law Group</H3></CENTER>

<P>Our group consists primarily of trial attorneys with a broad range of trial experience transcending intellectual property issues. This broad experience is essential given the continually expanding scope of intellectual property litigation to include antitrust,  unfair competition,  wrongful termination,  employment law,  and,  at times,  even RICO claims. We have practiced in the intellectual property area since the inception of our business litigation practice,  but in recent years our intellectual property work has become more intense and extensive.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Experience and Clients</H3></CENTER>

<P>In the wide-ranging area of intellectual property litigation,  we have represented plaintiffs and defendants located throughout the country in courts located throughout the country. In addition we have represented foreign companies,  including Canadian companies,  in U.S. litigation. The claims involved in these cases include patent,  trademark,  copyright,  and trade secret infringement. Moreover,  since intellectual property disputes often arise in the employment context,  our background in handling employment disputes (including trade secret,  employment,  and noncompete agreements) has proved invaluable.<BR><P>We handle the complex intellectual property problems of some of the country's largest companies,  such as Honeywell's patent litigation regarding autofocus camera technologies. The firm has represented intellectual property clients in high-tech industries such as electronics,  telecommunications,  computer software development,  cable television,  medical imaging,  and biomedical,  as well as other fields including the food and beverage industry,  personal services,  publishing,  military weapons and vehicles,  automotive design,  the music and entertainment industry and the design and manufacture of miscellaneous consumer goods.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm's intellectual property clients include Alliant Techsystems Inc.,  American Business Information Inc.,  Canadian Electronics Ltd.,  Fonar Corporation,  Harris Waste Management Group,  Honeywell,  Inc.,  Hollander Inc.,  NordicTrack,  Pitney-Bowes,  UNOCAL,  Veritec Corporation,  and W.R. Grace  & Co. The cases we have handled for these clients have included such expected claims as patent,  trademark,  and copyright infringement,  but have also included Lanham Act,  RICO,  and antitrust violations. The subject matters of these cases include military weapons,  cellular batteries,  camera technology,  electronic musical instruments,  computer software,  and automotive vehicles.

<P><B>W</B>ith roots going back more than 100 years,  Schuyler,  Roche  & Zwirner is one of the oldest law firms in Chicago. The firm has been involved since its inception in intellectual property litigation. Our experience includes the prosecution and defense of cases in all areas of intellectual property law,  both domestically and internationally. We have handled matters involving trademark,  service mark,  copyright,  and trade dress infringement; unfair competition; protection of trade secrets; enforcement of restrictive covenants and confidentiality agreements; and,  working with patent lawyers,  the prosecution and defense of patent infringement actions.
<P><UL><BR><BR>
<BR><P>The following are typical matters we have handled:<BR><P><LI> In a series of cases,  we represented a company which owned the rights to the names and likenesses of many well-known performing artists. We obtained preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and damages against various enterprises that produced and sold bootleg merchandise bearing the names and likenesses of those artists.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> We brought an action on behalf of a British manufacturer of orthopedic devices,  alleging `reverse passing off' i.e.,  the defendant was passing off our client's products as its own. We obtained a preliminary injunction prohibiting that practice. The case settled before trial on terms highly favorable to our client.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> We prosecuted an action for violation of a confidentiality agreement entered into by our client and a competitor when the two companies were discussing a potential business arrangement. We obtained a preliminary injunction against the opposing party which remained in effect for years,  survived an appeal,  and ultimately caused the competitor to stay out of the relevant product market.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> We filed a trademark opposition to stop our client's competitor from using a logo which was deceptively similar to our client's. The suit resulted in a settlement in which our client's competitor agreed to withdraw its trademark application.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> We obtained preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring our client's competitor to change its packaging and name because they were confusingly similar to our client's. We also obtained a judgment for damages.<BR>
<BR></UL><BR>
<LI><B>James D. Adducci</B> has represented major clients of the firm in numerous intellectual property disputes in both the international and domestic arenas. Recently,  he obtained a large jury verdict,  including a significant punitive damages award,  on behalf of a company whose trade secrets had been misappropriated.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>David M. Allen</B> has brought a series of copyright infringement suits on behalf of a licensee of medical recording systems. In the resulting settlements,  our client's competitors were permanently enjoined from publishing,  marketing,  and selling any works infringing our client's copyrights.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Marshall L. Blankenship</B> represents one of the firm's principal corporate clients in connection with its ongoing enforcement and preservation of its trademarks,  patents,  and copyrights,  both nationally and internationally. He also recently won a sizable jury verdict in a trade secrets misappropriation case.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Michael F. Braun</B> successfully prosecuted an action under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act which resulted in the recovery of significant damages and attorneys' fees for the client.

<BR>
<LI><B>L. Andrew Brehm</B> recently defended successfully one of the firm's clients before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit against allegations of contributory and vicarious trademark infringement. He has also participated in Lanham Act and copyright infringement litigation.<BR>

<P>The lawyers of Kilpatrick & Cody serve clients around the world from offices in
Atlanta, Augusta, Washington, D.C., London, and Brussels. The hallmark of our
service is our ability to develop cost-effective relationships with our
clients-relationships based on quality, efficiency, and teamwork-to solve their
problems and achieve their goals.</P>

<H4>International Arbitration</H4>
<P>Since 1986, Kilpatrick & Cody has represented transnational business enterprises
in international arbitration disputes in the United Kingdom, France, Denmark,
Switzerland, Sweden, Mexico, and the United States. The arbitral forums have
included the International Chambers of Commerce, the London Court of
International Arbitration, the American Arbitration Association, the World
Intellectual Property Organization, the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution,
and various Chambers of Commerce throughout Europe.</P>
<P>	The firm's clients in such matters have included companies from England,
Germany, Finland, Sweden, Latin America, and the United States. Industries
represented include telecommunications, construction, heavy machinery, and
consumer products. The subject matter of the disputes has included trademark and
patent rights, agency and distribution matters, franchise agreements, joint
ventures, and other commercial contracts. In most of these matters, Kilpatrick &
Cody has acted as lead counsel, with such assistance from qualified local
counsel as may be necessary.</P>
<P>	Kilpatrick & Cody's international arbitration practice has been rapidly
expanding in recent years, not only because of the quality of the service
provided and the results obtained, but also because of substantial competitive
cost advantages in using Atlanta-based counsel experienced in such matters to
perform time-intensive tasks. Current exchange rates further confirm these cost
advantages. European clients, as well as American-based companies, have
perceived and availed themselves of these advantages.</P>
<P>	Sophisticated communications technology and the firm's European offices
provide important support for the international arbitration practice.</P>
<P>	References provided on request. All contacts should be made with A. Stephens
Clay, through any of the firm's offices. Mr. Clay has been substantially

These controversies have involved construction contracts, franchiseagreements, intellectual property rights, shareholders' agreements, andlong-term oil and gas supply contracts, to cite just a few examples. Paul, Weissalso represented the prevailing party in the first major International Chamberof Commerce (ICC) "fast-track" arbitration, where proceedings were held and anaward delivered within 60 days after the arbitration was commenced.	<P>	The firm has been intimately involved, through its Paris office, with allphases of one of the largest construction projects of this century, the ChannelTunnel, from its conception in 1985 through the arbitration of several sizeabledisputes which have arisen in connection with building and operating the Tunnel,which continue to this day; it has represented an African national against aEuropean oil company, successfully defeating a claim for breach of a long-termoil supply contract in an ICC arbitration in France; is currently representing aJapanese client in related European arbitrations concerning technology licensetransfers; represents a large South American industrial company in an ICCarbitration commenced against a leading Scandinavian manufacturer of heavyequipment; successfully represented a U.S. shareholder in a Danish corporationin an ICC arbitration governed by Danish law, brought by Danish shareholdersalleging violation of a shareholders agreement; represented a U.S. company in aChinese arbitration against a PRC claimant, and a Chinese bank against aEuropean exporter in an arbitration brought under the rules of the StockholmChamber of Commerce; and represented two principal parties in an ICC"fast-track" arbitration involving the validity and enforceability of along-term natural gas contract between a Canadian seller and a U.S. buyer, whichunderpinned a $2.5 billion CanadianU.S. pipeline project.	<P>In addition, Paul, Weiss attorneys have acted as arbitrators in many recentmatters, including a dispute between U.S. and U.K. parties, both leaders in thefield of glass production, with the seat of the arbitration in London; acontroversy concerning a construction project in Senegal, governed by the rulesprovided by the European Development Fund; an ICC arbitration in New Yorkbetween a U.S. company and its Malaysian and Singaporean franchisees; and adispute between the Hong Kong subsidiary of a U.S. company and a Shanghai firm,whose governing law was Chinese with the seat of the arbitration in Stockholm.</UL></UL></BODY></HTML>

<P><B>C</B>lifton Budd  & DeMaria is a nationally known employment law firm representing management. It has one of the nation's oldest employment law practices dating back to the early 1900s,  when one of its predecessor firms tried the precedent-setting <I>Danbury Hatter </I>case. In 1969,  in order to better serve its clients,  the firm decided to limit its practice to employment law,  a decision which it believes has afforded its clients both knowledgeable and experienced representation.<BR>

<P><BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Overview of the Firm's Practice
</H3></CENTER>

<P>The firm represents many of the largest companies in the United States in all areas of employment law,  ranging from traditional union matters such as collective bargaining,  representation before the National Labor Relations Board,  and union avoidance,  to the less traditional areas involving advice on employee benefits plans,  employment discrimination,  occupational health and safety,  and employment litigation. Our clients represent household names in such industries as publishing,  aircraft production,  the cosmetics and chemical industries,  and many others. In addition,  the firm advises numerous smaller employers and has a number of clients in the hotel,  printing,  and soft drink industries,  as well as many in the health care industry. The firm also represents several public employers. On various occasions during the year,  the firm offers to its clients seminars on employment law topics of current interest. The firm publishes a bimonthly newsletter,  <I>Labor  & Employment Law</I>,  which is provided to firm clients without charge and is forwarded to nonclient companies on a subscription basis. In addition,  the firm produces training manuals and pamphlets on employment topics,  such as <I>Silence is Not Golden</I>,  together with training videos. These are provided to clients where appropriate. Because of its focused practice,  the firm is able to offer broad geographic experience in employment law,  permitting it to be competitive with regional firms across the United States.<BR>
<BR><P>As a result of the many complexities created by the introduction each year of new employment litigation,  the firm assigns certain partners and associates to maintain in-depth knowledge of all new legislation and interpretive decisions.<BR>
<BR>

<P><B>M</B>organ,  Lewis  & Bockius LLP is nationally recognized for its labor and employment services to management in the private and public sectors. We represent large and small clients in the manufacturing,  transportation,  construction,  energy,  health care,  financial service,  pharmaceutical,  charitable institution,  professional sports,  chemicals,  consulting,  publishing,  hospitality,  communications,  service,  and agricultural sectors.
<P><BR><P><I>Employment Discrimination Advice and Litigation</I> We counsel clients concerning compliance with federal,  state,  and local statutes prohibiting employment discrimination to minimize the likelihood of employment discrimination claims. When claims are made,  we aggressively defend our clients' interests and have had notable success in administrative and judicial forums,  including jury trials.<BR><P><I>Employee Relations</I> We work actively with clients in reviewing and revising employment practices and policies,  training managers and supervisors,  drafting and defending affirmative action plans,  counseling on and structuring reductions in force (OWBPA and WARN),  and undertaking or implementing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Our practice includes ADA and FMLA compliance and advice in connection with sales,  mergers,  acquisitions and corporate restructuring.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation</I> The collective experience of our employee benefits lawyers covers the spectrum of executive compensation and employee benefit plans,  programs,  and arrangements. We regularly draft and defend plans including qualified pension,  profit-sharing,  thrift,  stock bonus,  401(k),  employee stock ownership,  nonqualified executive deferred compensation and supplemental benefit,  incentive,  severance benefit,  stock option and phantom stock,  executive and group life insurance programs,  health and welfare,  long-term and short-term disability income programs,  cafeteria and flexible benefits,  voluntary incentive plans used in restructuring situations,  and fringe benefits. Lawyers also serve as counsel to trustees of many of the largest collectively bargained multiemployer pension and welfare plans in the country.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Labor-Management Relations and Labor Disputes</I> We provide creative strategies for dealing with unions that represent or seek to represent our clients' employees. We advise and represent clients in collective bargaining,  labor mediations and arbitrations,  and union organizing campaigns.<BR>
<BR><P>We represent national multiemployer bargaining associations in various industries,  including coal,  over-the-road trucking,  and freight and passenger railroads. We also pioneered the use of construction project agreements with the Building and Construction Trades international and local unions to expedite dispute-free construction of major projects.<BR>
<BR><P>When clients and their unions are unable to resolve their disputes through negotiation,  we vigorously represent our clients' interests in forums,  including federal and state courts,  arbitration,  NLRB,  FMCS,  NMB,  and FLRA. We also provide advice during labor disputes,  including strike contingency plans and countermeasures for boycotts and `corporate campaigns.'<BR>
<BR><P><I>Occupational Safety and Health</I> Our OSHA practitioners conduct compliance audits,  advise clients regarding government inspections,  and select and supervise technical consultants to provide full representation of clients under state and federal occupational safety and health laws. We regularly represent clients contesting health and safety citations,  achieving success in litigation if necessary,  and equally important achieving agency withdrawal citations without costly litigation.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Wage and Hour Laws</I> Lawyers advise and represent clients in claims and disputes arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act,  Davis-Bacon Act,  Service Contract Act,  and analogous state statutes. We educate managers and supervisors regarding applicable legal requirements,  and provide advice during compliance audits. When enforcement proceedings are brought,  we represent clients in administrative and judicial forums.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Other Employment Law Claims</I> We counsel and defend employers against the many common law and statutory claims that are potentially available to would-be,  current,  and former employees. Those claims include express and implied contract and wrongful termination claims,  claims based on statutes addressing family and medical leave,  notices to workers of facility shutdowns or layoffs,  drug testing,  polygraph tests,  and whistleblower protection.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Railway Labor Act</I> We counsel and represent airline and railroad carriers in connection with their rights and responsibilities under the RLA,  including major and minor disputes; challenges to carriers' rights to change or interpret the status quo with respect to rates of pay,  rules and working conditions; and in matters before the National Mediation Board,  Presidential emergency boards,  and system boards.<BR>
<BR><P><I>Noncompetition Agreements and Related Obligations</I> We help clients protect trade secrets and other proprietary information through the use of noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements,  intellectual property agreements,  and other contracts,  and represent them in the initiation or defense of litigation.<BR>

We have broad experience with the employment laws and practices in the European Union,  British Commonwealth,  Pacific Rim,  Latin America,  and other jurisdictions.

<P>
<P><B>F</B>ounded in 1947,  Shawe  & Rosenthal is one of the oldest firms in the country devoted exclusively to the representation of management in labor and employment matters. Its 16 attorneys appear regularly before federal,  state,  and local courts and administrative agencies throughout the nation. In recognition of its position as a leader among labor law practitioners,  Shawe  & Rosenthal was selected by Matthew Bender Company to write the <I>Employment Law Deskbook</I>,  a practical guide to complying with labor and employment laws written especially for managers and human resources personnel.
<P><BR><P>Shawe  & Rosenthal's attorneys are knowledgeable concerning laws governing all aspects of the employer-employee relationship,  including the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,  the Americans with Disabilities Act,  the Family and Medical Leave Act,  the National Labor Relations Act,  the Davis-Bacon Act,  the Fair Labor Standards Act,  ERISA,  and OSHA. The firm has successfully defended management against statutory employment discrimination claims,  as well as increasingly popular common law claims such as abusive discharge,  breach of contract,  fraud,  defamation,  and infliction of emotional distress. In addition,  Shawe  & Rosenthal has represented management in unfair competition and trade secret litigation,  and in employment-related immigration matters.<BR><P>The firm also represents both union and nonunion companies in traditional labor law matters. Since it was established,  Shawe  & Rosenthal has successfully represented nonunion clients in more than 3, 000 representation cases. For clients whose employees are represented by a union,  Shawe  & Rosenthal's attorneys serve as spokespersons at the collective bargaining table,  as advisors to human resources personnel on the administration of labor contracts,  and as advocates of management in arbitration and court proceedings arising out of contract disputes.<BR>
<BR><P>Shawe  & Rosenthal recognizes that it has been most successful when a client is not sued,  not when it ultimately prevails in court or before an administrative agency. Thus,  the firm places great emphasis on preventive law. To this end,  Shawe  & Rosenthal reviews and analyzes clients' personnel policies,  employment applications,  and employee benefit plans; develops,  reviews,  and monitors affirmative action plans; develops and implements equal employment opportunity audits; assists in the drafting and implementation of sexual harassment policies; advises management regarding sensitive employment decisions; instructs managerial employees in their equal employment opportunity obligations; and advises clients regarding important changes in the law through client seminars,  a firm newsletter,  and client advisories.<BR>
<BR><P>Shawe  & Rosenthal has for many years represented Maryland's four largest publicly held companies Black  & Decker Corporation,  United States Fidelity  & Guaranty Company,  Baltimore Gas  & Electric Company,  and Bethlehem Steel. The firm also serves as labor and employment counsel to such national concerns as McDonald's Corporation,  May Department Stores,  The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,  Jos. A. Bank Clothiers,  and Thiokol Corporation.<BR>

In 1989,  the entire firm merged with a large Wall Street firm where,  subsequently,  Mr. King and Mr. Abate became partners. The group remained at this firm until January 1993 when Beatie,  King  & Abate was formed.<BR><P>Much of the firm's practice involves the defense of a major manufacturer of drugs,  pharmaceuticals,  and agricultural products in hundreds of multidefendant cases involving the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES). In the DES cases,  the firm has participated in national defense efforts,  coordinated work to be done by local law firms,  handled cases directly,  tried a large number of cases to verdict,  negotiated the settlement of large blocks of cases,  and participated in or managed national and regional settlement programs. In addition,  the firm has been retained by a major European pharmaceutical manufacturer to assist in the defense of the DES cases in the Netherlands and France.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm also represents a major computer manufacturer in the defense of the cases alleging repetitive stress injuries,  and is one of the firms which assist in the coordination of strategy in that litigation. In addition,  the group has been involved in the defense of asbestos and asbestos-related cases in New York,  including its representation of an asbestos defendant in a limited fund settlement class action brought by the company to resolve mass tort liability.<BR>
<BR><P>Mr. Beatie has also handled products cases for manufacturers of medical devices and other products,  including pacemakers and oral contraceptives. The firm has successfully defended cases involving a range of other pharmaceutical products such as insulin,  antibiotics,  phenobarbital,  diphtheria vaccine,  and antidepressants. In each instance it has handled complex scientific issues in order to take discovery,  deal with experts,  argue motions,  and try the cases.<BR>
<BR><P>Beatie,  King  & Abate has broad trial and appellate experience. The firm has tried products liability and other types of cases in Connecticut,  New York,  New Jersey,  Texas,  Delaware,  Maryland,  the District of Columbia,  Illinois,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Oklahoma,  and California,  most of them to a jury. They have ranged from three days to four months. In addition,  the firm has argued numerous appeals on a variety of issues before the highest courts in the states of New York,  New Hampshire,  Connecticut,  Florida,  and New Jersey,  and the U.S. Courts of Appeal for the Second,  Third,  Fifth,  Sixth,  Ninth,  and Tenth Circuits. In the process,  the firm has produced a number of innovative trial and appellate rulings,  including establishing favorable law for product liability defendants on issues such as limited-fund-settlement class actions,  statute of limitations,  nonidentification liability,  the viability of spouse's loss of consortium claims,  and the viability of the claims of third-generation plaintiffs (and of parents for cost of raising an injured child).<BR>
<BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI><B>Russel H. Beatie,  Jr.</B> From 1980 to 1983,  Mr. Beatie served on an advisory committee to the board of directors of a corporation involved in asbestos litigation. He has served as part of a national counsel group that manages mass tort lawsuits nationwide,  and has also been involved in matters relating to insurance coverage for mass tort litigations. Mr. Beatie is a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Kenneth J. King</B> Mr. King has worked on products liability and mass tort litigation for 11 years,  including the diethylstilbestrol and repetitive stress injury cases.

<P><B>C</B>rosby,  Heafey,  Roach  & May has been in the forefront of product litigation since product liability law was recognized in California more than 30 years ago. Representing prominent manufacturers in the medical equipment,  pharmaceutical,  and automotive industries,  we have helped develop the law of product liability in California and nationally.

<P><BR><P>We not only defend product liability lawsuits involving personal injury and property damage but also represent our manufacturing clients in commercial litigation involving warranty and economic loss. We serve as national and regional coordinating counsel for some of our corporate clients,  supervising litigation in federal and state courts.

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Insurance Practice Group</H3></CENTER>

<P>Crosby,  Heafey,  Roach  & May is actively involved in litigation that defines the boundaries of insurance,  and has been for nearly a century. Representing such insurance companies as Allstate Insurance Company,  Farmers Insurance Group of Companies,  The ITT Hartford Group of Insurance Companies,  Reliance Insurance Company,  Risk Enterprise Management Limited (The Home Insurance Company),  and Transamerica Group of Insurance Companies,  we have helped this area of law evolve. Thus,  we understand where it is heading and how to protect our clients' interests in the face of change.<BR><P>The Insurance Practice Group's services to insurers go well beyond providing advice as to the interpretation and application of policies and defending against bad faith claims. We also provide counseling with respect to the handling of large or particularly sensitive claims and fraud investigations. We represent insurers in actions involving regulatory bodies and governmental entities. Further,  Crosby Heafey's commercial litigators are able to work with the Insurance Practice Group to handle general commercial problems on behalf of insurance companies,  such as contractual disputes and claims of unfair competition. We also represent managing general agents,  brokerage firms,  third-party administrators,  and claims adjusting organizations.<BR>
<BR><P>The Insurance Practice Group handles coverage matters involving both first-party (property,  business interruption,  health,  life,  and disability) and third-party (comprehensive general liability,  environmental,  homeowner,  worker's compensation,  professional liability,  and specialty lines) issues. The Group's attorneys are thoroughly experienced as well with issues unique to excess coverage and reinsurance. Members of the Group lecture frequently to industry trade associations and within the legal community. Several Crosby Heafey attorneys have qualified numerous times as expert witnesses on insurance matters.<BR>
<BR><P>Unlike almost any other firm with a significant insurance practice,  Crosby Heafey's Insurance Practice Group is able to work closely with our 15-member Appellate Practice Group,  which represents not only individual insurers in state and federal appeals throughout the nation,  but also insurance industry groups who ask us to appear on their behalf as <I>amicus curiae</I> in matters critical to the welfare of the industry.<BR>

Jauregui</B> (<I>510-466-6762</I>) has handled a broad spectrum of insurance-related litigation,  including coverage cases,  reinsurance and contribution disputes,  and bad faith. <B>Raoul D. Kennedy</B> (<I>510-466-6726</I>) handles complex civil litigation at both the trial and appellate level. In 1991 he was cited by the <I>National Law Journal</I> as one of the 30 most influential insurance defense lawyers in America. He is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers,  a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates,  and a past president of the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers. <B>Steven M.

<P>
<P><B>H</B>oyle,  Morris  & Kerr has a national practice that includes a wide variety of commercial litigation. Firm attorneys are particularly experienced in products liability and toxic tort cases and associated insurance coverage disputes.
<P><BR><P>Since its inception,  the Firm has been heavily involved in the defense of products liability and toxic torts claims. For instance,  we currently handle toxic tort and products liability problems for a major chemical company nationally. We also serve as counsel for a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company which has been sued in multiple jurisdictions in connection with a blood clotting concentrate administered to hemophiliacs linked to transmission of AIDS. On behalf of another Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company,  we defend cases involving claims of adverse effects allegedly attributable to its drug,  device,  and general health care products. Attorneys in the Firm represent other pharmaceutical companies in the defense of DES,  toxic shock syndrome,  and baby bottle syndrome cases.<BR><P>We have represented a major cement manufacturer in a multidistrict litigation proceeding arising from lawsuits filed by railroads complaining of alleged defects in prestressed concrete railroad ties. Our products liability practice has also included representing manufacturers of such diverse products as tires,  fork-lifts,  rifles,  toasters,  hand-presses,  apparel,  herbicides,  and underground storage containers.<BR>
<BR><P>We gained substantial experience in multijurisdictional toxic tort litigation through our role as national coordinating counsel and special bankruptcy counsel for a major building products manufacturer in asbestos litigation,  and we currently represent one of the largest former manufacturers of asbestos-containing fireproofing in asbestos property damage litigation. Notably,  we obtained defense verdicts in the first two asbestos property damage cases ever tried to conclusion before juries,  and have continued to earn a successful win-loss record in this litigation. We are particularly adept in selecting and working with experts to marshal the complex medical-scientific evidence on which modern toxic tort claims are based.<BR>
<BR><P>As a result of our defense of underlying litigation on behalf of companies whose insurance carriers have denied coverage,  we represent corporate policyholders in disputes with their carriers over coverage for environmental,  products liability,  and toxic tort claims,  as well as claims for business interruption and property losses.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>O</B>ur experience in product liability defense has included a broad range of products,  from consumer products,  electronics and electricals,  and industrial machinery,  to alleged toxic materials and pharmaceuticals,  where we have defended manufacturers,  distributors and retailers,  and repairers and installers. 
<P><BR><BR>
<BR><P>Through our experience in defending and trying product liability cases in state and federal courts throughout New England,  we have gained considerable familiarity with plaintiffs' counsel in the area and their varying abilities and inclinations. In our national coordination work,  such as in the asbestos litigation,  we have become familiar with plaintiff and defense firms across the country.<BR><P>Our experience has also given us a good deal of knowledge about manufacturing systems and processes; the great range of regulations,  such as OSHA and state regulations,  governing safety in a variety of workplaces; and voluntary standards applicable to various types of products. Finally,  we have worked with a number of technical experts engineers,  human factors experts,  and others who provide helpful direction in the development of a defense of a lawsuit,  and sometimes-necessary expert testimony at trial.<BR>
<BR><P>In addition,  members of the firm serve as coordinating counsel for various clients with numbers of similar cases pending in multiple jurisdictions. The practice of the product liability defense group also includes advice in product liability prevention,  including warnings and instructions. Examples include:<BR><UL>
<BR><P><LI> A surface-treatment chemical manufacturer national coordinating counsel for product liability litigation.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> A national warehouse retailer of home improvement products and food and general merchandise prevention advice; product liability coordinating counsel.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> A safety-eyewear manufacturer coordination of products lawsuits; advice on warnings and other written materials; general prevention advice.<BR>
<BR><P><LI> An asbestos cement and insulation manufacturer nationwide coordination of asbestos lawsuits.<BR></UL>
<BR><P>We are accustomed to working closely with our clients in planning litigation strategy that is as cost-effective as possible,  while maximizing the achievement of the client's goals in the particular case.<BR>
<BR><P>Knowledge of a client's personnel,  products,  and processes is a valuable commodity,  and so we maintain the same lawyer or lawyers on all of the client's cases. One partner is responsible for and works on a client's cases,  and directly supervises any other lawyer who may work on the case. Within this framework,  most of our cases are handled by a single attorney,  with necessary supervision,  to avoid duplication of effort and expense.<BR>
<BR><P>Morrison,  Mahoney  & Miller is a defense firm composed of over 200 attorneys licensed to practice in numerous jurisdictions,  including all six New England states. Our Boston office and other offices located in Raynham,  Springfield,  Worcester,  and Yarmouth Port,  Massachusetts; Hartford,  Connecticut; Providence,  Rhode Island; Southfield and Grand Rapids,  Michigan; San Francisco; and New York City permit the firm to handle matters throughout New England. The firm's London office enhances our ability to serve clients with international interests. As a complement to our strong New England presence,  the firm is a member of the American Law Firm Association (ALFA),  a national network of legal counsel,  enabling the firm to obtain counsel for its clients in other parts of the country as the need arises.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm handles a full range of tort litigation,  including architects and engineers and construction cases,  workers' compensation,  subrogation cases,  and insurance policy coverage analysis,  opinions,  and litigation. Our litigation services cover all phases from pre-complaint,  through discovery and trial,  to post-appeal.

<P><B>P</B>aul,  Weiss has substantial experience and expertise in all phases of products liability litigation,  case management,  and counseling. The defense of products liability cases has been an important part of the firm's litigation practice since our representation of General Motors in the Corvair cases brought in the 1960s. In the 1970s,  we were involved in the defense of the most catastrophic grain elevator explosion in history. Subsequently,  we have represented manufacturers of asbestos products,  cigarettes,  medical products,  valves for nuclear power plants,  school buses,  and washing machines in products liability cases across the country. A half-dozen litigation partners have spent significant amounts of their time on products liability matters in recent years.
<P><BR><P>Paul,  Weiss litigators have special expertise in coordinating multijurisdiction litigation,  having acted as national coordinating counsel for one of the principal tobacco companies in smoking and health litigation.<BR><P>We have advised a major corporation in the coordination of its defense of asbestos cases across the country,  and negotiated its membership in the Asbestos Claims Facility.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm also represents a large manufacturer of medical and hospital equipment in a series of cases across the country brought by individuals who claim to have contracted AIDS as a result of their use of our client's products.<BR>
<BR><P>Paul,  Weiss litigators have been active in litigation assessing governmental responsibility for damages in products liability cases. In that regard we have been engaged in the prosecution of an asbestos manufacturer's claims against the U.S. government,  seeking reimbursement for liability incurred as a result of manufacturing products made for the government according to government specifications,  or as a result of the government's negligence in maintaining the conditions under which the products were used.<BR>
<BR><P>The firm has also taken an active role in the defense and prosecution of design defect cases that have not resulted in personal injuries. We served as counsel in the defense of two claims seeking $700 million in damages for the alleged negligent design of a valve for a nuclear power plant.<BR>
<BR><P>We have also successfully prosecuted products liability actions for governmental agencies arising out of defectively designed products. Most notably,  we obtained an $80 million jury verdict for the New York City Transit Authority for the defective design of subway cars,  as well as a $46 million settlement for the same client relating to a fleet of buses that it purchased.<BR>
<BR><P>We regularly defend and counsel our domestic and foreign clients on products liability matters,  ranging from gasoline pipe leaks to oil platform explosions,  helicopter crashes,  and other catastrophic circumstances giving rise to actual or potential liability.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>P</B>eterson,  Johnson  & Murray,  S.C. was founded in 1982 by a group of experienced trial lawyers dedicated to providing competent,  aggressive,  and ethically sound litigation defense to the manufacturing and insurance industries. In surveys of Milwaukee County judges and attorneys the firm is consistently chosen as the finest civil defense law firm in the area. All shareholders in the product liability and insurance defense group have `high' to `preeminent' <I>Martindale-Hubbell </I>ratings,  and the firm as a whole is rated `Av.'
<P><BR><P>The firm's reputation is our clients' most valuable asset when entering the courtroom or sitting down at the negotiation table. Our clients' litigation adversaries are acutely aware of the firm's absolute commitment to try cases that cannot be settled reasonably.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Product Liability Practice</H3></CENTER>

<P>The firm defends a broad spectrum of manufacturers,  ranging from local concerns to multinational corporations. The products involved in this litigation have been as varied as our clients,  and range from simple personal care products to large-scale industrial machinery. The firm is involved in all phases of toxic tort litigation. We have extensive experience in the defense of cases involving alleged defects in medical and pharmaceutical products. On the national scene our attorneys frequently participate in multidistrict,  complex litigation which crosses jurisdictional lines,  such as aircraft disasters.<BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Insurance Defense Practice</H3></CENTER>

<P>The firm has handled thousands of personal injury cases,  representing the largest insurers in the nation. We defend individual and corporate insureds who have coverage under a broad range of insurance contracts,  from simple homeowner's policies to complex commercial general liability policies. The types of cases which arise under these policies and which we defend are virtually limitless,  and include everything from simple slip-and-fall or fire loss cases,  to complex business construction disputes,  to commercial and business litigation,  to pollution cases. The attorneys who work in these areas also have substantial experience with respect to insurance coverage disputes and `bad faith' litigation,  enabling the firm to handle multifaceted cases comprehensively yet economically.<BR><P>The legal and medical communities consistently turn to the firm for professional malpractice defense. The firm also plays a leading role in major legal developments on the appellate level,  and has been chosen by organizations of insurers to submit <I>amicus curiae</I> briefs in significant appellate cases involving issues of general importance to the defense bar.<BR>

<P><B>T</B>he firm represents manufacturers,  suppliers,  premises owners and other corporations in toxic tort and products liability litigation involving both personal injury and property damage claims. We serve as national coordinating trial counsel for the defense of such cases where multiple litigations are involved. With the help of contacts from our national network of local counsel and experts,  we are able to introduce our clients' most sophisticated and technical defenses into all parts of the country.
<P><BR><P>The firm defends individual lawsuits,  mass tort claims,  and class actions alleging products liability in connection with product design,  manufacture,  and warnings; chemical contamination; radiation contamination; and waste disposal. Because we are a litigation firm,  we handle cases from the earliest pre-trial and investigative stages through trial and through resolution on appeal. These cases involve asbestos-containing products,  hazardous wastes,  military hardware,  `sick buildings, ' chlorinated and other synthetic pesticides,  solvents,  detergents,  radioactive materials,  herbicides,  petroleum byproducts,  feedstocks and derivatives,  and various other chemicals and chemical products. We defend with a science-based motions and trial practice,  especially where plaintiffs allege that an occupational,  environmental,  or residential `exposure' (from air,  property or groundwater contamination) caused chronic disease or subclinical injury. We have litigated several of the most significant post-<I>Daubert</I> toxics cases,  and we attack junk science proponents outside the mainstream of recognized disciplines in their willingness to associate injury or `contamination' with exposure even to minuscule amounts of alleged toxins. The firm defends against allegations of chemical carcinogenicity,  leukemogenicity,  immunogenicity,  and latent toxicity.<BR>

<P><B>B</B>rown,  Rudnick,  Freed  & Gesmer is a full-service regional law firm. The Brown Rudnick model for client service replaces the traditional method of having lawyers define their practice by a substantive legal field. Our emphasis is to have our lawyers become knowledgeable about,  and practice in,  particular client industries (such as banking or health care) or client problem areas (such as environmental compliance,  insurance coverage recovery,  securitization,  affordable housing,  and zoning and land use).
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Business Investigations and Criminal Defense</H3></CENTER>

<P>The Business Investigations and Criminal Defense Group has responded to the increasingly complex regulation and criminalization of federal and state industry by forming a team approach to client service. Each complex matter is staffed both by a seasoned industry or service-area practitioner (such as a tax,  health care,  banking,  or environmental lawyer),  as well as by an experienced litigator (to provide investigative and defense skills). By doing so,  we immediately provide the in-depth industry knowledge and strategic skills necessary to best represent our clients. As a regional firm,  we are able to provide this service throughout New England.<BR><BR><P>Our recent activities include representation of: a manufacturer in connection with a criminal antitrust investigation conducted by the Department of Justice involving businesses throughout the United States; a Boston teaching hospital in connection with an investigation into alleged violations of the Medicare anti-kickback statute; a Massachusetts teaching hospital in connection with an investigation into billing practices for non-FDA approved medical devices,  and a well-known nonprofit corporation being investigated for violations of the Federal Clean Air Act.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>S</B>ince its founding in New York in 1849,  Davis Polk  & Wardwell has devoted its practice to advising clients with respect to complex civil and criminal litigation,  and corporate and tax problems.
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Overview of the Practice Area</H3></CENTER>

<P>Davis Polk has a unique history of representing institutions and individuals in complex criminal cases. Over the years,  many of the firm's top litigators have held governmental positions as prosecutors or as enforcement officials,  and these experiences have provided the firm with significant expertise in matters involving questions of criminal liability. As a consequence,  we routinely advise and represent clients in the establishment and maintenance of corporate compliance programs,  internal investigations,  grand jury investigations,  and trials involving allegations of securities fraud,  bank fraud,  antitrust violations,  insider trading,  environmental crime,  money laundering,  bribery,  and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Many of the criminal cases we handle,  moreover,  involve `parallel proceedings.' Davis Polk's concurrent expertise in the areas of white collar crime,  complex civil litigation,  and regulatory enforcement make the firm particularly suited to the defense of such multifaceted cases.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Experience and Clients</H3></CENTER>
<BR><BR><P>Davis Polk has been involved in some of the most complicated white collar cases of our time. The following is a partial list of the clients whom we have represented in criminal matters during the last few years:<BR>

<P><B>G</B>ibson,  Dunn  & Crutcher's Business Crimes and Investigations Practice Group has vast experience in defending against a wide range of federal and state prosecutions in a variety of substantive areas including antitrust,  procurement fraud,  financial institution fraud,  securities fraud,  state and federal environmental violations and regulatory compliance,  health care fraud,  immigration fraud,  tax offenses,  RICO,  money laundering,  and civil and criminal forfeiture. The Group's members are highly experienced trial lawyers; several are former prosecutors while others have always been defense lawyers. These lawyers also have extensive experience in advising clients with respect to proceedings before federal and state grand juries and before suspension,  debarment,  and program exclusion authorities. We have represented clients in post-conviction sentencing,  <I>habeas corpus</I>,  and appellate proceedings in federal and state court and in interlocutory appeals during the pendency of the prosecutions. The practice group's investigative arm also assists clients who are the victims of fraud,  theft,  or embezzlement. Finally,  its lawyers have advised corporate clients on establishing corporate legal compliance programs and codes of conduct and ethics.
<P><BR><P>The firm's practice group is co-chaired by <B>Robert C. Bonner</B> and <B>Thomas E. Holliday</B>,  who are both located in Los Angeles. Mr. Bonner is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and was U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California from 1984 to 1989. Thereafter,  he was appointed to the federal bench. From 1990 to 1993 he served as the administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Holliday is also a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and has spent his entire 20-year career as a defense lawyer. His cases include <I>United States </I>v.<I> General Dynamics,  United States </I>v. <I>Parker,  </I>and <I>United States </I>v.<I> Goldberg</I>. <B>Stephen E. Tallent</B> is the founder of the practice group and works out of both the Los Angeles and Washington,  D.C. offices. Mr. Tallent is a nationally recognized expert in labor law and advises clients on internal investigations and corporate compliance obligations.<BR><P>The group also maintains a substantial practice in Washington. <B>F. Joseph Warin </B>is a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and specializes in criminal cases involving antitrust,  health care,  and FDA issues. <B>John H. Sturc</B> is also a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and spent six years as associate director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. Mr. Sturc specializes in securities defense and while at the SEC was involved in cases such as the investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. <B>Theodore Olson </B>was the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice during the Reagan administration. He handles appellate cases and specialized proceedings throughout the United States. <B>John A. Mintz</B> joined the Washington office following his retirement from the FBI where he had served as an assistant director. In addition to providing legal counsel,  Mr. Mintz is the group's chief investigator.<BR>
<BR><P>The group also has lawyers in several other offices of the firm. For example,  <B>Joel Sanders</B> is located in the San Francisco office and before joining the firm was a trial attorney with the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. He now specializes in defending against alleged antitrust violations. <B>James P. Clark</B>,  located in the Century City office,  is an antitrust lawyer and former law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom. He coauthored the <I>Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation</I> treatise and also specializes in the defense of antitrust cases. <B>David Palmer</B>,  located in the Denver office,  has an extensive practice in the defense of criminal and regulatory environmental cases and <I>qui tam</I> actions arising out of criminal investigations. The practice group also includes several associates,  including <B>Chad S. Hummel</B> and <B>Larry Byrne</B>. Mr. Hummel is a 1988 graduate of the University of Chicago,  who has tried several complex criminal cases,  including <I>United States </I>v.<I> Barrientos </I>and<I> United States </I>v.<I> Parker</I>.

<P><B>G</B>reenbaum,  Rowe is one of New Jersey's largest law firms devoted to representing clients in areas of complex litigation,  banking,  securities,  general corporate,  tax,  and real estate. Its White Collar Criminal Defense Group is equipped to step in immediately and represent corporations,  their officers and directors,  and professionals whose business and social lives are shaped in large part by their reputations.
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>White Collar Criminal Defense Group</H3></CENTER>

<P>Led by a team of former federal prosecutors,  Greenbaum,  Rowe's White Collar Criminal Defense Group has represented numerous corporations (both public and private) and individuals in federal and state investigations and prosecutions. The Group is frequently called upon by corporations to use its expertise and conduct internal affairs investigations to detect improprieties,  as well as to recommend strategies for implementing compliance programs to better position the corporate client in dealing with law enforcement. The Group's expertise includes defending against investigations and prosecutions of alleged insider trading and other types of alleged securities fraud,  antitrust violations,  government procurement and bank fraud violations,  food and drug violations,  political corruption,  and environmental and tax fraud matters. The Group is also active in defending against the numerous civil proceedings that may parallel criminal proceedings,  including actions by federal agencies such as the FDIC and RTC.<BR><P>The Group has extensive experience with statutes such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),  the Bank Secrecy Act,  the Currency Transaction Bank Reporting Act,  and the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Act (FIRREA). Within the last several years,  the Group successfully obtained the acquittal of the president of a corporation in a highly publicized corruption case,  <I>State of New Jersey </I>v.<I> DeMarino,  et al.</I>; represented a director of the New York Federal Reserve Board in an insider trading case,  <I>United States </I>v. <I>Rough</I>; represented a number of attorneys,  directors,  and officers in bank fraud prosecutions including <I>United States </I>v.<I> Hartmann</I> (director and counsel to bank); and represented numerous corporations and individuals in criminal tax prosecutions,  including <I>United States </I>v.<I> Getty</I>.<BR>
<BR><P>The Group considers some of its most valuable services to be the numerous criminal prosecutions it has prevented. The Group is cognizant that frequently the most damage to a corporation's or individual's reputation occurs as a result of an indictment,  and not necessarily a conviction. Accordingly,  because of its knowledge and experience,  the Group often is called upon to dissuade prosecution.<BR>

<P><B>I</B>n 1985,  King  & Spalding was retained by the board of directors of E.F. Hutton Company Inc. to conduct an exhaustive internal corporate investigation into facts that caused Hutton to plead guilty to approximately 2, 000 counts of wire fraud and mail fraud.
<P><BR><P>Shortly after the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989,  the board of directors of Exxon Corporation retained King  & Spalding to assist the appointed Independent Litigation Committee in investigating various allegations in shareholder derivative actions and demand letters.<BR><P>Based on its extensive involvement in Hutton's and Exxon's internal corporate investigations,  King  & Spalding formed a Special Matters Group,  consisting of trial lawyers experienced and knowledgeable in handling internal investigations for corporations and all related criminal and civil matters. The investigations are generally performed for a corporate board of directors,  the outside directors,  or the chief executive officer,  although they may be performed for an independent committee of the board of directors where a shareholder derivative suit has been filed. The primary objectives in these matters are to assess responsibility,  defend against the charges,  and structure creative solutions to the issues which gave rise to the investigations.<BR>
<BR><P>Services rendered by the Special Matters Group include representation in criminal or regulatory investigations; representation of businesses that have been victimized by dishonest employees,  vendors,  or others; and representation of the corporations and corporate officers against charges such as bank fraud in criminal or related shareholder derivative litigation. This Group also assists in legal audits and provides counseling in preventive law,  including advice about ethical programs and systems that monitor corporate and individual conduct.<BR>

<P><B>K</B>ravit,  Gass  & Weber is a boutique law firm concentrating in aggravated litigation,  bankruptcy cases,  and resolution of difficult matters,  with special expertise in fraud and RICO. The Firm,  founded in 1985,  has highly credentialed lawyers,  many formerly associated with large law firms,  who choose to work in the environment of a smaller practice. All members of the firm have backgrounds of outstanding achievement,  such as fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers; federal or state supreme court law clerk; member or editor of a law review; or former assistant U.S. attorney. The firm relies on talented staff and state-of-the-art computer support to deliver quality service in complex,  aggravated matters.

<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>White Collar and Business Criminal Practice</H3></CENTER>

<P>Defense of matters that have criminal implications involves both art and science. We are often called into situations that are rapidly deteriorating as events spin out of control. The key in such situations is to get control of the facts immediately and develop a strategy to interact with investigative authorities. We have significant experience in developing such strategies.<BR><P>We represent alleged perpetrators (corporations,  managers,  defrauders),  as well as victims (corporations,  employers,  people who have been defrauded). We know how to interact cooperatively with the government where necessary,  and how to beat it. We have helped companies by doing internal investigations and fraud consulting. We are intimately familiar with problems of parallel civil,  administrative,  and criminal litigation,  and have managed defenses involving multiple districts and nationwide interests.<BR>
<BR><P>This is an era of escalating complexity in criminal cases. Sentencing guidelines impact on all decisions at all stages of a federal criminal investigation and prosecution. We are skilled and experienced in guideline matters and sentencing trials. One of our lawyers served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission.<BR>
<BR><P>Wisconsin is very aggressive in certain business criminal areas,  especially in environmental,  securities,  and antitrust enforcement. We have significant experience with the special prosecutorial units that oversee these cases,  and with the district attorneys who may also be involved.<BR>
<BR><P>We work as a team, and have the resources to jump in and hit the ground running on short notice.<BR>
