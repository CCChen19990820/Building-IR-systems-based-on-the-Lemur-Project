<TITLE>SRL-2 - Weddell Sea ice</TITLE>
<H1>Weddell Sea ice
</H1> 
<P>
This is the first calibrated, multi-frequency, multi-polarization
spaceborne radar image of the seasonal sea-ice cover in the Weddell Sea,
Antarctica. The
multi-channel data provide scientists with details about the ice pack
they cannot see any other way and indicates that the large expanse of
sea-ice is, in fact,
comprised of many smaller rounded ice floes, shown in blue-gray. These
data are particularly useful in helping scientists estimate the
thickness of the ice cover
which is often extremely difficult to measure with other remote sensing
systems. The extent, and especially thickness, of the polar ocean's
sea-ice cover together
have important implications for global climate by regulating the loss of
heat from the ocean to the cold polar atmosphere. The image was acquired
on October 3,
1994, by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. This image is
produced by
overlaying three channels of radar data in the following colors: red
(C-band, HH-polarization), green (L-band HV-polarization), and blue
(L-band,
HH-polarization). The image is oriented almost east-west with a center
location of 58.2 degrees South and 21.6 degrees East. Image dimensions
are 45 kilometers
by 18 kilometers (28 miles by 11 miles). Most of the ice cover is
composed of rounded, undeformed blue-gray floes, about 0.7 meters (2
feet) thick, which are
surrounded by a jumble of red-tinged deformed ice pieces which are up to
2 meters (7 feet) thick. The winter cycle of ice growth and deformation
often causes this
ice cover to split apart, exposing open water or 'leads'. Ice growth
within these openings is rapid due to the cold, brisk Antarctic
atmosphere. Different stages of
new-ice growth can be seen within the linear leads, resulting from
continuous opening and closing. The blue lines within the leads are open
water areas in new
fractures which are roughened by wind. The bright red lines are an
intermediate stage of new-ice growth perhaps 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4
inches) thick. The
more extensive dark zones are covered by a slightly thicker layer of
smooth, level ice up to 70 centimeters (28 inches) thick.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mississippi Delta</TITLE>
<H1>Mississippi Delta
</H1> 
<P> 
This is a radar image of the Mississippi River Delta where the river
enters into the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Louisiana. This
multi-frequency image
demonstrates the capability of the radar to distinguish different types
of wetlands surfaces in river deltas. This image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging
Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space
shuttle Endeavour on October 2, 1995. The image is centered on latitude
29.3
degrees North latitude and 89.28 degrees West longitude. The area shown
is approximately 63 kilometers by 43 kilometers (39 miles by 26 miles).
North is
towards the upper right of the image. As the river enters the Gulf of
Mexico, it loses energy and dumps its load of sediment that it has
carried on its journey
through the mid-continent. This pile of sediment, or mud, accumulates
over the years building up the delta front. As one part of the delta
becomes clogged with
sediment, the delta front will migrate in search of new areas to grow.
The area shown on this image is the currently active delta front of the
Mississippi. The
migratory nature of the delta forms natural traps for oil and the
numerous bright spots along the outside of the delta are drilling
platforms. Most of the land in the
image consists of mud flats and marsh lands. There is little human
settlement in this area due to the instability of the sediments. The
main shipping channel of the
Mississippi River is the broad red stripe running northwest to southeast
down the left side of the image. The bright spots within the channel are
ships. The colors in
the image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the
radar as follows: red is L-band vertically transmitted, vertically
received; green is C-band
vertically transmitted, vertically received; blue is X-band vertically
transmitted, vertically received.

<TITLE>SRL-2 Houston, Texas</TITLE>
<H1>SRL-2 Houston, Texas</H1> 
<BODY>
<P>
This image of Houston, Texas, shows the amount of detail that is
possible to obtain using spaceborne radar imaging.  Images such as this
-- obtained by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) flying aboard the space shuttle Endeavor last fall
-- can become an effective tool for urban planners who map and monitor
land use patterns in urban, agricultural and wetland areas. Central
Houston appears pink and white in the upper portion of the image,
outlined and crisscrossed by freeways.  The image was obtained on
October 10, 1994, during the space shuttle's 167th orbit.  The area
shown is 100 kilometers by 60 kilometers (62 miles by 38 miles) and is
centered at 29.38 degrees north latitude, 95.1 degrees west longitude.
North is toward the upper left.  The pink areas designate urban
development while the green- and blue-patterned areas are agricultural
fields.  Black areas are bodies of water, including Galveston Bay along
the right edge and the Gulf of Mexico at the bottom of the image.
Interstate 45 runs from top to bottom through the image.  The narrow
island at the bottom of the image is Galveston Island, with the city of
Galveston at its northeast (right) end.  The dark cross in the upper
center of the image is Hobby Airport.  Ellington Air Force Base is
visible below Hobby on the other side of Interstate 45.  Clear Lake is
the dark body of water in the middle right of the image.  The green
square just north of Clear Lake is Johnson Space Center, home of Mission
Control and the astronaut training facilities.  The black rectangle with
a white center that appears to the left of the city center is the
Houston Astrodome.  The colors in this image were obtained using the
follow radar channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted, vertically received); green represents the C-band
(horizontally transmitted, vertically received); blue represents the
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received).

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Wadi Kufra, Libya</TITLE>
<H1>Wadi Kufra, Libya
</H1> 
<P> 
The ability of a sophisticated radar instrument to image large regions
of the world from space, using different frequencies that can
penetrate dry sand cover, produced the discovery in this image: a
previously unknown branch of an ancient river, buried under
thousands of years of windblown sand in a region of the Sahara Desert in
North Africa. This area is near the Kufra Oasis in southeast
Libya, centered at 23.3 degrees north latitude, 22.9 degrees east
longitude. The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging
Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR) imaging radar when it
flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 60th orbit
on October 4, 1994. This SIR-C image reveals a system of old, now
inactive stream valleys, called "paleodrainage systems," which,
during periods of wetter climate, carried running water northward across
the Sahara. The region is now hyper-arid, receiving only a
few millimeters of rainfall per year, and the valleys are now dry
"wadis," or channels, mostly buried by windblown sand. Prior to the
SIR-C mission, the west branch of this paleodrainage system, known as
the Wadi Kufra (the dark channel along the left side of the
image), was recognized and much of its course outlined. The broader east
branch of Wadi Kufra, running from the upper center to the
right edge of the image, was, however, unknown until the SIR-C imaging
radar instrument was able to delineate its dimensions: at
least 5 kilometers wide and nearly 100 kilometers long (3 miles by 62
miles). The two branches of Wadi Kufra converge at the Kufra
Oasis, the cluster of circular fields at the top of the image. The farms
at Kufra depend on irrigation water from the Nubian Aquifer
System. The paleodrainage pattern unveiled by SIR-C suggests that the
location of productive wells at the confluence of the old river
valleys is no accident. Quite likely, the water supply for the Kufra
Oasis has been recharged by episodic runoff and by groundwater that
moved northward in the alluvial fill of the old stream channels.
Rainfall was more abundant in this region during parts of the late
Quaternary when Stone Age (Paleolithic and later Neolithic) people left
their implements along the riverbanks. The SIR-C image,
which clearly shows river channels cut into the surrounding bedrock,
provides a "road map" for geoarchaeologists to locate artifacts
and to better interpret the history of early people and climatic
conditions in this region. The area shown is approximately 120
kilometers by 78 kilometers (74 miles by 48 miles). North is toward the
upper left. The colors in this image were obtained using the
following radar channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted and received); green represents the average of the C- and
L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); blue represents the
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received).

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mississippi River</TITLE>
<H1>Mississippi River
</H1> 
<P> 
This image of the Mississippi River in Mississippi and Louisiana shows
regions of the southern United States that are prone to
flooding. Data acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band
Synthetic Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR) system, which flew on two
space shuttle missions in April and October 1994, can help scientists
assess flooding potentials and improve land management for
future agricultural development. This image was acquired on October 9,
1994, during orbit 151 of space shuttle Endeavour. The image
is centered at about 32.75 degrees north latitude and 90.5 degrees west
longitude and covers an area of about 23 kilometers by 40
kilometers (14.2 miles by 24.8 miles). North is toward the upper right
of the image. The different colors represent the data return in
different radar channels: red is L- band, vertically transmitted and
received; green is L-band vertically transmitted and horizontally
received; and blue is C-band vertically transmitted and received. This
site along the Mississippi River lies north of Vicksburg along
the Louisiana-Mississippi state border. The river marks the stateline.
Louisiana lies above the river and Mississippi is below the river.
This region is characterized by rich farmland where a variety of crops
are grown. The town located in the extreme upper left hand
corner is Eudora, Louisiana. The long, narrow lakes which lie roughly
parallel to the river are called oxbow lakes, named for the
U-shaped harness worn by an ox. Oxbows are formed when a river changes
course, abandoning old channels in favor of a new course.
As the river changes course, the surrounding land dries out, leaving
these lakes isolated. Oxbow lakes are common in areas where rivers
flow through generally flat terrain, allowing the river to easily change
course. The green regions bordering the river are undeveloped
forested areas.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - New York City</TITLE>
<H1>New York City
</H1> 
<P> 
This is radar image of the New York city metropolitan area. The island
of Manhattan appears in the center of the image. The
green-colored rectangle on Manhattan is Central Park. This image was
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/ X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle
Endeavour on October 10, 1994. North is toward the upper right.
The area shown is 75.0 kilometers by 48.8 kilometers (46.5 miles by 30.2
miles). The image is centered at 40.7 degrees north latitude
and 73.8 degrees west longitude. In general, light blue areas correspond
to dense urban development, green areas to moderately
vegetated zones and black areas to bodies of water. The Hudson River is
the black strip that runs from the left edge to the upper right
corner of the image. It separates New Jersey, in the upper left of the
image, from New York. The Atlantic Ocean is at the bottom of the
image where two barrier islands along the southern shore of Long Island
are also visible. John F. Kennedy International Airport is
visible above these islands. Long Island Sound, separating Long Island
from Connecticut, is the dark area right of the center of the
image. Many bridges are visible in the image, including the Verrazano
Narrows, George Washington and Brooklyn bridges. The radar
illumination is from the left of the image; this causes some urban zones
to appear red because the streets are at a perpendicular angle to
the radar pulse. The colors in this image were obtained using the
following radar channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted and received); green represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted, vertically received); blue represents the C-band
(horizontally transmitted, vertically received). Radar images like this
one could be used as a tool for city planners and resource
managers to map and monitor land use patterns. The radar imaging systems
can clearly detect the variety of landscapes in the area, as
well as the density of urban development.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Star City, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Star City, Russia
</H1> 
<P> 
This radar image shows the Star City cosmonaut training center, east of
Moscow, Russia. Four American astronauts are training here for
future long-duration flights aboard the Russian Mir space station. These
joint flights are giving NASA and the Russian Space Agency
experience necessary for the construction of the international Alpha
space station, beginning in late 1997. This image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR), on its 62nd orbit on October 3, 1994. This Star City
image
is centered at 55.55 degrees north latitude and 38.0 degrees east
longitude. The area shown is approximately 32 kilometers by 49
kilometers
(20 miles by 30 miles). North is to the top in this image. The radar
illumination is from the top of the image. The image was produced using
three channels of SIR-C radar data: red indicates L-band (23 cm
wavelength, horizontally transmitted and received); green indicates
L-band
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received); blue indicates
C-band (6 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted and vertically
received).
In general, dark pink areas are agricultural; pink and light blue areas
are urban communities; black areas represent lakes and rivers; dark blue
areas are cleared forest; and light green areas are forested. The
prominent black runways just right of center are Shchelkovo Airfield,
about 4
km long. The textured pale blue-green area east and southeast of
Shchelkovo Airfield is forest. Just east of the runways is a thin
railroad line
running southeast; the Star City compound lies just east of the small
bend in the rail line. Star City contains the living quarters and
training
facilities for Russian cosmonauts and their families. Moscow's inner
loop road is visible at the lower left edge of the image. The Kremlin is
just off the left edge, on the banks of the meandering Moskva River. The
Klyazma River snakes to the southeast from the reservoir in the
upper left (shown in bright red), passing just east of Star City and
flowing off the lower right edge of the image. The dark blue band of the
Vorya River runs north-south in the upper right quadrant, east of Star
City. SIR-C/X-SAR radar images are being compared with data from
the Russian radar satellite Almaz to evaluate the usefulness of a
permanent orbital radar platform in monitoring Earth s environment and
ecology.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Angkor, Cambodia</TITLE>
<h1>Angkor, Cambodia</h1>
This is an image of  the area around the city of  Angkor, 
Cambodia.  The city houses an ancient complex of more than 
60 temples dating back to the 9th century.  The principal 
complex, Angkor Wat, is the bright square just left of the 
center of the image. It is surrounded by a reservoir that 
appears in this image as a thick black line. The larger 
bright square above Angkor Wat is another temple complex 
called Angkor Thom. Archeologists studying this image 
believe the blue-purple area slightly north of Angkor Thom 
may be previously undiscovered structures. In the lower 
right is a bright rectangle surrounded by a dark reservoir, 
which houses the temple complex Chau Srei Vibol. In its 
heyday, Angkor had a population of 1 million residents  and 
was the spiritual center for the Khmer people until it was 
abandoned in the 15th century.  The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on the 15th orbit of the space shuttle 
Endeavour on September 30, 1994. The image shows an area 
approximately 55 kilometers by 85 kilometers (34 miles by 53 
miles) that is centered at 13.43 degrees north latitude and 
103.9 degrees east longitude. The colors in this image were 
obtained using the following radar channels: red represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  The 
body of water in the south-southwest corner is Tonle Sap, 
Cambodia's great central lake. The urban area at the lower 
left of the image is the present-day town of Siem Reap. The 
adjoining lines are both modern and ancient roads and the 
remains of Angkor's vast canal system that was used for both 
irrigation and transportation. The large black rectangles 
are ancient reservoirs. Today the Angkor complex is hidden 
beneath a dense rainforest canopy, making it difficult for 
researchers on the ground to study the ancient city.  The 
SIR-C/X-SAR data are being used by archaeologists at the 
World Monuments Fund and the Royal Angkor Foundation to 
understand how the city grew, flourished and later fell into 
disuse over an 800-year period.  The data are also being 
used to help reconstruct the vast system of hydrological 
works, canals and reservoirs, which have gone out of use 
over time. Research teams from more than 11 countries will 
be using this data to study the Angkor complex. P-45156</i>

     Images from the international Space Radar Laboratory may 
help researchers find previously unknown settlements near the 
ancient city of Angkor in Cambodia.
<P>
     The radar data were obtained during the October 1994 flight 
of the space shuttle Endeavour, processed and then sent in 
January to the World Monuments Fund in New York City. The group 
had approached the radar science team about observing the Angkor 
area after the Space Radar Laboratory's first flight in April 
1994.
<P>
     "I had read about the radar mission while the April mission 
was in progress and instantly surmised that it would have 
applications to the international research efforts at Angkor," 
said John Stubbs, program director of the World Monuments Fund. 
"I didn't really know where to start, but I was hopeful NASA 
would be willing to image the area around Angkor."
<P>
     Angkor is a vast complex of more than 60 temples dating back 
to the 9th century that served as the spiritual center for the 
Khmer people.  In its heyday the city housed a population of 
about 1 million people and was supported by a massive 
hydrological system of reservoirs and canals.

     The April 1994 flight of the Space Radar Laboratory's 
complementary radars -- the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Bahia, Brazil</TITLE>
<H1>Bahia, Brazil</H1>
<P>
This is a color composite image of southern Bahia, Brazil, 
centered at 15.22 degree south latitude and 39.07 degrees 
west longitude.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on its 38th orbit of Earth on 
October 2, 1994.  The image covers an area centered over the 
Una Biological Reserve, one the largest protected areas in 
northeastern Brazil.  The 7,000-hectare reserve is 
administered by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment 
and is part of the larger Atlantic coastal forest, a narrow 
band of rain forest extending along the eastern coast of 
Brazil.  The Atlantic coastal forest of southern Bahia is 
one of the world's most threatened and diverse ecosystems. 
Due to widespread settlement, only 2 to 5 percent of the 
original forest cover remains.  Yet the region still 
contains an astounding variety of plants and animals, 
including a large number of endemic species.  More than half 
of the region's tree species and 80 percent of its animal 
species are indigenous and found nowhere else on Earth.  The 
Una Reserve is also the only federally protected habitat for 
the golden-headed lion tamarin, the yellow-breasted capuchin 
monkey and many other endangered species.  In the past few 
years, scientists from Brazilian and international 
conservation organizations have coordinated efforts to study 
the biological diversity of this region and to develop 
practical and economically viable options for preserving the 
remaining primary forests in southern Bahia.  The shuttle 
imaging radar is used in this study to identify various land 
uses and vegetation types, including remaining patches of 
primary forest, cabruca forest (cacao planted in the 
understory of the native forest), secondary forest, pasture 
and coastal mangrove.  Standard remote-sensing technology 
that relies on light reflected from the forest canopy cannot 
accurately distinguish between cabruca and undisturbed 
forest.  Optical remote sensing is also limited by the 
nearly continuous cloud cover in the region and heavy 
rainfall, which occurs more than 150 days each year.  The 
ability of the shuttle radars to "see" through the forest 
canopy to the cultivated cacao below -- independent of 
weather or sunlight conditions -- will allow researchers to 
distinguish forest from cabruca in unprecedented detail. 
This SIR-C/X-SAR image was produced by assigning red to the 
L-band, green to the C-band and blue to the X-band.  The Una 
Reserve is located in the middle of the image west of the 
coastline and slightly northwest of Comandatuba River.  The 
reserve's primary forests are easily detected by the pink 
areas in the image.  The intensity of red in these areas is 
due to the high density of forest vegetation (biomass)  
detected by the radar's L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received) channel.  Secondary forest is visible 
along the reserve's eastern border.  The Serra do Mar 
mountain range is located in the top left portion of the 
image.  Cabruca forest to the west of Una Reserve has a 
different texture and a yellow color.  The removal of 
understory in cabruca forest reduces its biomass relative to 
primary forest, which changes the L-band and C-band 
penetration depth and returns, and produces a different 
texture and color in the image.  The region along the 
Atlantic is mainly mangrove swamp, agricultural fields and 
urban areas.  The high intensity of blue in this region is a 
result of increasing X-band return in areas covered with 
swamp and low vegetation.  The image clearly separates the 
mangrove region (east of coastal Highway 001, shown in blue) 
from the taller and dryer forest west of the highway.  The 
high resolution capability of SIR-C/X-SAR imaging and the 
sensitivity of its frequency and polarization channels to 
various land covers will be used for monitoring and mapping 
areas of importance for conservation.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Chernobyl, Ukraine</TITLE>
<H1>Chernobyl, Ukraine</H1> 
<P> 
This is an image of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and 
its surroundings, centered at 51.17 north latitude and 30.15 
west longitude.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on its 16th orbit on October 1, 
1994.  The area is located on the northern border of the 
Ukraine Republic and was produced by using the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received) polarization.  The 
differences in the intensity are due to differences in 
vegetation cover, with brighter areas being indicative of 
more vegetation. These data were acquired as part of a 
collaboration between NASA and the National Space Agency of 
Ukraine in Remote Sensing and Earth Sciences.  NASA has 
included several sites provided by the Ukrainian space 
agency as targets of opportunity during the second flight of 
SIR-C/X-SAR.  The Ukrainian space agency also plans to 
conduct airborne surveys of these sites during the mission.  
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located toward the top 
of the image near the Pripyat River.  The 12-kilometer 
(7.44-mile)-long cooling pond is easily distinguishable as 
an elongated dark shape in the center near the top of the 
image.  The reactor complex is visible as the bright area to 
the extreme left of the cooling pond and the city of 
Chernobyl is the bright area just below the cooling pond 
next to the Pripyat River.  The large dark area in the 
bottom right of the image is the Kiev Reservoir just north 
of Kiev.  Also visible is the Dnieper River, which feeds 
into the Kiev Reservoir from the top of the image.  The 
Soviet government evacuated 116,000 people within 30 
kilometers (18.6 miles) of the Chernobyl reactor after the 
explosion and fire on April 26, 1986.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Colima Volcano, Mexico</TITLE>
<H1>Colima Volcano, Mexico</H1> 
<P> 
This is an image of the Colima volcano in Jalisco, Mexico, a 
vigorously active volcano that  erupted as recently as July 
1994.  The eruption partially destroyed a lava dome at the 
summit and deposited a new layer of ash on the volcano's 
southern slopes. Surrounding communities face a continuing 
threat of ashfalls and volcanic mudflows from the volcano, 
which has been designated one of 15 high-risk volcanoes for 
scientific study during the next decade.  This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space 
shuttle Endeavour on its 24th orbit on October 1, 1994. The 
image is centered at 19.4 degrees north latitude, 103.7 
degrees west longitude.  The area shown is approximately 
35.7 kilometers by 37.5 kilometers (22 miles by 23 miles). 
This single-frequency, multi-polarized SIR-C image shows: 
red as L-band horizontally transmitted and received; green 
as L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received; 
and blue as the ratio of the two channels. The summit area 
appears orange and the recent deposits fill the valleys 
along the south and southwest slopes.  Observations from 
space are helping scientists understand the behavior of 
dangerous volcanoes and will be used to mitigate the effects 
of future eruptions on surrounding populations.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Washington, D.C.</TITLE>
<H1>Washington, D.C.</H1> 
<P> 
This radar image of the Washington, D.C. area demonstrates the 
capability of  imaging radar as a useful tool for urban planners and 
managers to map and monitor land use patterns. The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 150th orbit on April 18, 
1994.  North is toward the upper right.  The Potomac River enters the 
scene at the top of the image, widens near the center of the image, then 
runs south and west off the left side of the image.  Downtown Washington 
appears near the center, just to the right of the point where the river 
widens.  The image shows an area 50.3 kilometers by 45.0 kilometers 
(31.2 miles by 27.9 miles) that is centered at 38.9 degrees north 
latitude and 77.1 degrees west longitude.  The radar illumination is 
from the left side of the image. The image shows a single channel of 
SIR-C radar data: L-band, horizontally transmitted and received.  State 
and city boundaries are also visible in the image.  Virginia is to the 
left (southwest) of the Potomac River.  Maryland and the District of 
Columbia are to the right (northeast).  The avenues that form the 
boundary between Maryland and the District of Columbia appear as bright 
lines because the radar strikes the walls of buildings along the avenues 
at a perpendicular angle.  The dark strip near the center of the image 
is the National Mall, and the Ellipse and White House grounds can be 
seen as an adjacent dark patch.  The Capital Beltway highway appears as 
a thin black strip encircling the city.  The large dark rectangle near 
the bottom of the image is Andrews Air Force Base, home of the 
presidential plane Air Force One.  Dark patches to the right of the 
image represent some of the few remaining agricultural areas in this 
rapidly expanding metropolitan area.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Glasgow, Missouri</TITLE>
<H1>Glasgow, Missouri</H1> 
<P> 
This is a false-color L-band image of an area near Glasgow, 
Missouri, centered at about 39.2 degrees north latitude and 
92.8 degrees west longitude. The image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 50th orbit on October 3, 1994.  The false-color 
composite was made by displaying the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted and received) return in red; the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received) return in 
green; and the sum of the two channels in blue. The area 
shown is approximately 37 kilometers by 25 kilometers (23 
miles by 16 miles). The radar data, coupled with pre-flood 
aerial photography and satellite data and post-flood 
topographic and field data, are being used to evaluate 
changes associated with levee breaks in landforms, where 
deposits formed during the widespread flooding in 1993 along 
the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The distinct radar 
scattering properties of farmland, sand fields and scoured 
areas will be used to inventory flood plains along the 
Missouri River and determine the processes by which these 
areas return to preflood conditions.  The image shows one 
such levee break near Glasgow, Missouri.  In the upper 
center of the radar image is a region covered by several 
meters of sand, shown as blue regions below the bend in the 
river. West (left) of this dark area, a blue gap in the 
levee tree canopy can be seen, showing the area where the 
levee failed. Radar data such as these can help scientists 
more accurately assess the potential for future flooding in 
this region and how that might impact surrounding 
communities.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Central Africa gorilla habitat</TITLE>
<H1>Central Africa gorilla habitat</H1> 
<P> 
This is a false-color composite of Central Africa, showing 
the Virunga volcano chain along the borders of Rwanda, Zaire 
and Uganda. This area is home to the endangered mountain 
gorillas.  The image was acquired on October 3, 1994, on 
orbit 58 of the space shuttle Endeavour by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR).  In this image red is the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received) polarization; green is the 
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received) polarization; 
and blue is the C-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received) polarization. The area is centered at about 2.4 
degrees south latitude and 30.8 degrees east longitude.  The 
image covers an area 56 kilometers by 70 kilometers (35 
miles by 43 miles). The dark area at the top of the image is 
Lake Kivu, which forms the border between Zaire (to the 
right) and Rwanda (to the left). In the center of the image 
is the steep cone of Nyiragongo volcano, rising 3,465 meters 
(11,369 feet) high, with its central crater now occupied by 
a lava lake. To the left are three volcanoes, Mount 
Karisimbi, rising 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) high;  Mount 
Sabinyo, rising 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) high; and Mount 
Muhavura, rising 4,100 meters (13,500 feet) high. To their 
right is Nyamuragira volcano, which is 3,053 meters (10,017 
feet) tall, with radiating lava flows dating from the 1950s 
to the late 1980s. These active volcanoes constitute a 
hazard to the towns of Goma, Zaire and the nearby Rwandan 
refugee camps, located on the shore of Lake Kivu at the top 
left.  This radar image highlights subtle differences in the 
vegetation of the region. The green patch to the center left 
of the image in the foothills of Karisimbi is a bamboo 
forest where the mountain gorillas live. The vegetation 
types in this area are an important factor in the habitat of 
mountain gorillas.  Researchers at Rutgers University in New 
Jersey and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund in London will use 
this data to produce vegetation maps of the area to aid in 
their studies of the last 650 mountain gorillas in the 
world. The faint lines above the bamboo forest are the 
result of agricultural terracing by the people who live in 
the region.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Kliuchevskoi Volcano, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Kliuchevskoi Volcano, Russia</H1> 
<P> 
This is an image of the Kliuchevskoi volcano, Kamchatka, Russia, 
which began to erupt on September 30, 1994.  Kliuchevskoi is the 
bright white peak surrounded by red slopes in the lower left 
portion of the image.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on its 25th orbit on October 1, 1994.  
The image shows an area approximately 30 kilometers by 60 
kilometers (18.5 miles by 37 miles) that is centered at 56.18 
degrees north latitude and 160.78 degrees east longitude. North 
is toward the top of the image.  The Kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world.  The volcanic zone 
sits above a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific plate is 
sinking beneath the northeast edge of the Eurasian plate. The 
Endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and photographic images 
of this region during the eruption, which will assist scientists 
in analyzing the dynamics of the current activity. The colors in 
this image were obtained using the following radar channels: red 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); 
green represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received).  The Kamchatka River runs 
from left to right across the image. An older, dormant volcanic 
region appears in green on the north side of the river.  The 
current eruption included massive ejections of gas, vapor and 
ash, which reached altitudes of 20,000 meters (65,000 feet).  
New lava flows are visible on the flanks of Kliuchevskoi, 
appearing yellow/green in the image, superimposed on the red 
surfaces in the lower center.  Melting snow triggered mudflows 
on the north flank of the volcano, which may threaten 
agricultural zones and other settlements in the valley to the 
north.

<H1>Kliuchevskoi Volcano optical/radar comparison</H1> 
<P> 
This comparison shows optical and radar imaging of Kliuchevshoi
volcano in Kamchatka, Russia, which began to erupt on September
30, 1994, as space shuttle mission STS-68 was beginning with its
Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) payload.
<P>
The optical photo at left was taken by shuttle astronauts during
the early hours of the eruption on September 30.  The ash plume,
which reached heights of more than 18 kilometers (50,000 feet), is 
emerging from a vent on the north flank of Kliuchevskoi, partially hidden 
by the plume and its shadow in this view.  The photograph is 
oriented with north toward the bottom, for comparison with 
the radar image at right acquired a few 
days later.  Near the center of the photo, a small whitish 
steam plume may be seen emanating from the growing lava dome 
of a companion volcano, Bezymianny.
<P>
In the radar image at right, Kliuchevskoi is the blue triangular peak in 
the center of the image, towards the left edge of the bright red 
area that delineates bare snow cover.  The image was 
acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on its 88th orbit on October 5, 1994.  The image 
shows an area approximately 75 kilometers by 100 kilometers 
(46 miles by 62 miles) that is centered at 56.07 degrees 
north latitude and 160.84 degrees east longitude.  North is 
toward the bottom of the image.  The radar illumination is 
from the top of the image.  The Kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world.  The volcanic 
zone sits above a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific 
plate is sinking beneath the northeast edge of the Eurasian 
plate. The Endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and 
photographic images of this region during the eruption, 
which will assist scientists in analyzing the dynamics of 
the recent activity. The colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels: red represents the L-
band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  In 
addition to Kliuchevskoi, two other active volcanoes are 
visible in the image.  Bezymianny, the circular crater above 
and to the right of Kliuchevskoi, contains a slowly growing 
lava dome.  Tolbachik is the large volcano with a dark 
summit crater near the upper right edge of the red snow 
covered area.  The Kamchatka River runs from right to left 
across the bottom of the image.  The current eruption of 
Kliuchevskoi included massive ejections of gas, vapor and 
ash, which reached altitudes of 15,000 meters (50,000 feet).  
Melting snow mixed with volcanic ash triggered mudflows on 
the flanks of the volcano.  Paths of these flows can be seen 
as thin lines in various shades of blue and green on the 
north flank in the center of the image.

<TITLE>SRL-2 Los Angeles</TITLE>
<H1>SIR-C image of Los Angeles, California</H1> 
<P> 
<P> 
This radar image shows the massive urbanization of  Los Angeles,
California.  The image extends from the Santa Monica Bay at the left
to the San Gabriel Mountains at the right.  Downtown Los Angeles is in
the center of the image.  The runways of the Los Angeles International
Airport appear as black strips at the left center of the image.  The
waterways of Marina del Rey are seen just above the airport.  The San
Gabriel Mountains and the city of Pasadena are at the right center of
the image.  Black areas on the mountains on the right are fire scars
from the 1993 Altadena fire.  The Rose Bowl is shown as a small circle
near the right center.  The complex freeway system is visible as dark
lines throughout the image.  Some city areas, such as Santa Monica in
the upper left, appear red due to the alignment of streets and
buildings to the incoming radar beam.  
<p>

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mammoth Mountain, California</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth Mountain, California</H1> 
<P> 
This false-color composite radar image of the Mammoth Mountain 
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit on 
October 3, 1994. The image is centered at 37.6 degrees north 
latitude and 119.0 degrees west longitude. The area is about 39 
kilometers by 51 kilometers (24 miles by 31 miles).  North is 
toward the bottom, about 45 degrees to the right. In this image, 
red was created using L-band (horizontally transmitted/ 
vertically received) polarization data; green was created using 
C-band (horizontally transmitted/vertically received) 
polarization data; and blue was created using C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received) polarization data. 
Crawley Lake appears dark at the center left of the image, just 
above or south of Long Valley. The Mammoth Mountain ski area is 
visible at the top right of the scene. The red areas correspond 
to forests, the dark blue areas are bare surfaces and the green 
areas are short vegetation, mainly brush. The purple areas at 
the higher elevations in the upper part of the scene are 
discontinuous patches of snow cover from a September 28 storm. 
New, very thin snow was falling before and during the second 
space shuttle pass. In parallel with the operational SIR-C data 
processing, an experimental effort is being conducted to test 
SAR data processing using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's 
massively parallel supercomputing facility, centered around the 
Cray Research T3D . These experiments will assess the abilities 
of large supercomputers to produce high throughput Synthetic 
Aperture Radar processing in preparation for upcoming data-
intensive SAR missions. The image released here was produced as 
part of this experimental effort.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mauna Loa, Hawaii</TITLE>
<h1>Mauna Loa, Hawaii</H1>
<P>
This image of the Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of 
Hawaii shows the capability of imaging radar to map lava 
flows and other volcanic structures.  Mauna Loa has erupted 
more than 35 times since the island was first visited by 
westerners in the early 1800s.  The large summit crater, 
called Mokuaweoweo Caldera, is clearly visible near the 
center of the image.  Leading away from the caldera (towards 
top right and lower center) are the two main rift zones 
shown here in orange.  Rift zones are areas of weakness 
within the upper part of the volcano that are often ripped 
open as new magma (molten rock) approaches the surface at 
the start of an eruption.  The most recent eruption of Mauna 
Loa was in March and April 1984, when segments of the 
northeast rift zones were active.  If the height of the 
volcano was measured from its base on the ocean floor 
instead of from sea level, Mauna Loa would be the tallest 
mountain on Earth.  Its peak (center of the image) rises 
more than 8 kilometers (5 miles) above the ocean floor.  The 
South Kona District, known for cultivation of macadamia nuts 
and coffee, can be seen in the lower left as white and blue 
areas along the coast.  North is toward the upper left.  The 
area shown is 41.5 by 75 kilometers (25.7 by 46.5 miles), 
centered at 19.5 degrees north latitude and 155.6 degrees 
west longitude.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/
X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 36th orbit 
on October 2, 1994.  The radar illumination is from the left 
of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained using 
the following radar channels:  red represents the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received); green represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted, vertically received); 
blue represents the C-band (horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received).  The resulting color combinations in 
this radar image are caused by differences in surface 
roughness of the lava flows.  Smoother flows, called 
pahoehoe flows, are depicted in red, and rougher flows, 
called a'a flows in volcanology terminology that originated 
in the Hawaiian language, are shown in yellow and white.  
Mauna Loa is one of 15 volcanoes worldwide that are being 
monitored by the scientific community as an "International 
Decade Volcano" because of the hazard that it represents to 
the local towns of Hilo and Kona.  The Kilauea volcano is 
located off to the right of  Mauna Loa and is not visible in 
this image.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Moscow</TITLE>
<H1>Moscow</H1>
<P>
This is a vertically polarized L-band image of the southern 
half of Moscow, an area which has been inhabited for 2,000 
years.  The image covers a diameter of approximately 50 
kilometers (31 miles) and was taken on September 30, 1994 by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The city of Moscow 
was founded about 750 years ago and today is home to about 8 
million residents. The southern half of the circular highway 
(a road that looks like a ring) can easily be identified as 
well as the roads and railways radiating out from the center 
of the city.  The city was named after the Moskwa River and 
replaced Russia's former capital, St. Petersburg, after the 
Russian Revolution in 1917. The river winding through Moscow 
shows up in various gray shades. The circular structure of 
many city roads can easily be identified, although subway 
connections covering several hundred kilometers are not 
visible in this image. The white areas within the ring road 
and outside of it are buildings of the city itself and its 
suburban towns.  Two of many airports are located in the 
west and southeast of Moscow, near the corners of the image.  
The Kremlin is located north just outside of the imaged city 
center.  It was actually built in the 16th century, when 
Ivan III was czar, and is famous for its various churches. 
In the surrounding area, light gray indicates forests, while 
the dark patches are agricultural areas.  The various shades 
from middle gray to dark gray indicate different stages of 
harvesting, ploughing and grassland.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - New Orleans, Louisiana</TITLE>
<H1>New Orleans, Louisiana</H1>
<P>



This image of  the area surrounding the city of New Orleans, 
Louisiana in the southeastern United States demonstrates the 
ability of multi-frequency imaging radar to distinguish 
different types of land cover.  The dark area in the center 
is Lake Pontchartrain. The thin line running across the lake 
is a causeway connecting New Orleans to the city of 
Mandeville.  Lake Borgne is the dark area in the lower right 
of the image.  The Mississippi River appears as a dark, wavy 
line in the lower left.  The white dots on the Mississippi 
are ships. The French Quarter is the brownish square near the 
left center of the image.  The New Orleans Airport is the 
bright spot near the center, jutting out into Lake 
Pontchartrain.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) 
during orbit 39 of space shuttle Endeavour on October 2, 
1994. The area is located at 30.10  degrees north latitude 
and 89.1 degrees west longitude. The area shown is 
approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) by 50 kilometers (30 
miles).   The colors in this image were obtained using the 
following radar channels: red represents the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received); green represents the 
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received); blue 
represents the L-band (vertically transmitted and received). 
The green areas are primarily vegetation consisting of swamp 
land and swamp forest (bayou) growing on sandy soil, while 
the pink areas are associated with reflections from buildings 
in urban and suburban areas. Different tones and colors in 
the vegetation areas will be studied by scientists to see how 
effective imaging radar data is in discriminating between 
different types of  wetlands.  Accurate maps of coastal 
wetland areas are important to ecologists studying wild fowl 
and the coastal environment.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Rabaul volcano, New Guinea</TITLE>
<H1>Rabaul volcano, New Guinea</H1>
<P>
This is a  radar image of the Rabaul volcano on the island 
of New Britain, Papua New Guinea taken almost a month after 
its September 19, 1994, eruption that killed five people and 
covered the town of  Rabaul and nearby villages with up to 
75 centimeters (30 inches) of ash.  More than 53,000 people 
have been displaced by the eruption.  The image was acquired 
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 173rd orbit on October 11, 1994.  This image is centered 
at 4.2 degrees south latitude and 152.2 degrees east 
longitude in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The area shown is 
approximately 21 kilometers by 25 kilometers (13 miles by 
15.5 miles).  North is toward the upper right. The colors in 
this image were obtained using the following radar channels: 
red represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received); green represents the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received); blue represents the C-
band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received). 
Most of the Rabaul volcano is underwater and the caldera 
(crater) creates Blanche Bay, the semi-circular body of 
water that occupies most of  the center of the image.  
Volcanic vents within the caldera are visible in the image 
and include Vulcan, on a peninsula on the west side of the 
bay, and Rabalanakaia and Tavurvur (the circular purple 
feature near the mouth of  the bay) on the east side.  Both 
Vulcan and Tavurvur were active during the 1994 eruption.  
Ash deposits appear red-orange on the image, and are most 
prominent on the south flanks of Vulcan and north and 
northwest of Tavurvur. A faint blue patch in the water in 
the center of the image is a large raft of floating pumice 
fragments that were ejected from Vulcan during the eruption 
and clog the inner bay.  Visible on the east side of the bay 
are the grid-like patterns of the streets of Rabaul and an 
airstrip, which appears as a dark northwest-trending band at 
the right-center of the image.  Ashfall and subsequent rains 
caused the collapse of most buildings in the town of Rabaul.  
Mudflows and flooding continue to pose serious threats to 
the town and surrounding villages.  Volcanologists and local 
authorities expect to use data such as this radar image to 
assist them in identifying the mechanisms of the eruption 
and future hazardous conditions that may be associated with 
the vigorously active volcano.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mt. Rainier, Washington</TITLE>
<H1>Mt. Rainier, Washington</H1> 
<P> 
This is a radar image of Mount Rainier in Washington state. The 
volcano last erupted about 150 years ago and numerous large 
floods and debris flows have originated on its slopes during the 
last century. Today the volcano is heavily mantled with glaciers 
and snowfields. More than 100,000 people live on young volcanic 
mudflows less than 10,000 years old and, consequently, are 
within the range of future, devastating mudslides. This image 
was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on its 20th orbit on October 1, 1994.  The area shown 
in the image is approximately 59 kilometers by 60 kilometers 
(36.5 miles by 37 miles).  North is toward the top left of the 
image, which was composed by assigning red and green colors to 
the L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically, and the L-
band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received. Blue 
indicates the C-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received. In addition to highlighting topographic slopes facing 
the space shuttle, SIR-C records rugged areas as brighter and 
smooth areas as darker.  The scene was illuminated by the 
shuttle's radar from the northwest so that northwest-facing 
slopes are brighter and southeast-facing slopes are dark.  
Forested regions are pale green in color; clear cuts and bare 
ground are bluish or purple; ice is dark green and white. The 
round cone at the center of the image is the 14,435-foot (4,399-
meter) active volcano, Mount Rainier.  On the lower slopes is a 
zone of rock ridges and rubble (purple to reddish) above 
coniferous forests (in yellow/green). The western boundary of 
Mount Rainier National Park is seen as a transition from 
protected, old-growth forest to heavily logged private land, a 
mosaic of recent clear cuts (bright purple/blue) and partially 
regrown timber plantations (pale blue). The prominent river seen 
curving away from the mountain at the top of the image (to the 
northwest) is the White River, and the river leaving the 
mountain at the bottom right of the image (south) is the 
Nisqually River, which flows out of the Nisqually glacier on the 
mountain.  The river leaving to the left of the mountain is the 
Carbon River, leading west and north toward heavily populated 
regions near Tacoma. The dark patch at the top right of the 
image is Bumping Lake. Other dark areas seen to the right of 
ridges throughout the image are radar shadow zones.  Radar 
images can be used to study the volcanic structure and the 
surrounding regions with linear rock boundaries and faults. In 
addition, the recovery of forested lands from natural disasters 
and the success of reforestation programs can also be monitored.  
Ultimately this data may be used to study the advance and 
retreat of glaciers and other forces of global change.

<H1>SIR-C image of San Francisco, California</H1> 
<P> 
This image of San Francisco, California shows how the radar
distingishes between densely populated urban areas and nearby areas
that are relatively unsettled.  Downtown San Francisco is at the
center and the city of Oakland is at the right across the San
Francisco Bay. Some city areas, such as the South of Market, called
the SOMA district in San Francisco, appear bright red due to the
alignment of streets and buildings to the incoming radar beam.
Various bridges in the area are also visible including the Golden Gate
Bridge (left center) at the opening of  San Francisco Bay, the Bay
Bridge (right center) connecting San Francisco and Oakland, and the
San Mateo Bridge (bottom center).  All the dark areas on the image are
relatively smooth water: the Pacific Ocean to the left, San Francisco
Bay in the center, and various reservoirs.  Two major faults bounding
the San Francisco-Oakland urban areas are visible on this image.  The
San Andreas fault, on the San Francisco peninsula, is seen in the
lower left of the image.  The fault trace is the straight feature
filled with linear reservoirs which appear dark.  The Hayward fault is
the straight feature on the right side of the image between the urban
areas and the hillier terrain to the east.  The image is about 42
kilometers by 58 kilometers (26 miles by 36 miles) with north toward
the upper right.  This area is centered at 37.83 degrees north
latitude, 122.38 degrees east longitude.
<p>
The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic
Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR)
imaging radar when it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 3,
1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German,  Italian and the United
States
space agencies, is part of  NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Taal volcano, Philippines</TITLE>
<H1>Taal volcano, Philippines</H1>
<P>
This is an image of Taal volcano, near Manila on the island 
of Luzon in the Philippines. The black area in the center is 
Taal Lake, which nearly fills the 30-kilometer-diameter (18-mile) 
caldera.  The caldera rim consists of deeply eroded 
hills and cliffs.  The large island in Taal Lake, which 
itself contains a crater lake, is known as Volcano Island.  
The bright yellow patch on the southwest side of the island 
marks the site of an explosion crater that formed during a 
deadly eruption of Taal in 1965.  The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 78th orbit on October 5, 1994.  The image shows an area 
approximately 56 kilometers by 112 kilometers (34 miles by 
68 miles) that is centered at 14.0 degrees north latitude 
and 121.0 degrees east longitude.  North is toward the upper 
right of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels: red represents the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  Since 
1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. Since early 1991, 
the volcano has been restless, with swarms of earthquakes, 
new steaming areas, ground fracturing, and increases in 
water temperature of the lake.  Volcanologists and other 
local authorities are carefully monitoring Taal to 
understand if the current activity may foretell an eruption. 
Taal is one of 15 "Decade Volcanoes" that have been 
identified by the volcanology community as presenting large 
potential hazards to population centers.  The bright area in 
the upper right of the image is the densely populated city 
of Manila, only 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the 
central crater.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Weddell Sea, Antarctica</TITLE>
<H1>Weddell Sea, Antarctica</H1> 
<P> 
This Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 
color composite shows a portion of the Weddell Sea, which is 
adjacent to the continent of Antarctica. The image shows  
extensive coverage of first-year sea ice mixtures and patches of 
open water inside the ice margin. The image covers a 100 
kilometer by 30 kilometer (62 mile by 18.5 mile) region of the 
southern ocean, centered at approximately 57 degrees south 
latitude and 3 degrees east longitude, which was acquired on 
October 3, 1994.  Data used to create this image were obtained 
using the L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received) in red; the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received) in green; and the C-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received) in blue. The sea ice, which appears rust-brown in the 
image, is composed of loosely packed floes from approximately 1 
meter to 2 meters (3 feet to 6.5 feet) thick and ranging from 1 
meter to 20 meters (3 feet to 65.5 feet) in diameter. Large 
patches of open water, shown as turquoise blue, are scattered 
throughout the area, which is typical for ice margins 
experiencing off-ice winds.  The thin, well-organized lines 
clearly visible in the ice pack are caused by radar energy 
reflected by floes riding the crest of ocean swells.  The wispy, 
black features seen throughout the image represent areas where 
new ice is forming. Sea ice, because it acts as an insulator, 
reduces the loss of heat between the relatively warm ocean and 
cold atmosphere.  This interaction is an important component of 
the global climate system.   Because of the unique combination 
of winds, currents and temperatures found in this region, ice 
can extend many hundreds of kilometers north of Antarctica each 
winter, which classifies the Weddell Sea as one of nature's 
greatest ice-making engines.  During the formation of sea ice, 
great quantities of salt are expelled from the frozen water.  
The salt increases the density of the upper layer of sea water, 
which then sinks to great depths.  Oceanographers believe this 
process forms most of the oceans' deep water.  Sea ice covering 
all of the southern oceans, including the Weddell Sea, typically 
reaches its most northerly extent in about September. As periods 
of daylight become gradually longer in the Southern Hemisphere, 
ice formation stops and the ice edge retreats southward.  By 
February, most of the sea ice surrounding Antarctica disappears. 
Imaging radar is extremely useful for studying the polar regions 
because of the long periods of darkness and extensive cloud 
cover.  The multiple frequencies of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments 
allow further study into ways of improving the separation of the 
various thickness ranges of sea ice, which are vital to 
understanding the heat balance in the ice, ocean and atmospheric 
system.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Yellowstone Park, Wyoming</TITLE>
<H1>Yellowstone Park, Wyoming</H1> 
<P> 
These two radar images show the majestic Yellowstone National 
Park, Wyoming, the oldest national park in the United States and 
home to the world's most spectacular geysers and hot springs. 
The region supports large populations of grizzly bears, elk and 
bison. In 1988, the park was burned by one of the most 
widespread fires to occur in the northern Rocky Mountains in the 
last 50 years. Surveys indicated that 793,880 acres of land 
burned. Of that, 41 percent was burned forest, with tree 
canopies totally consumed by the fire; 35 percent was a 
combination of unburned, scorched and blackened trees; 13 
percent was surface burn under an unburned canopy; 6 percent was 
non-forest burn; and 5 percent was undifferentiated burn. Six 
years later, the burned areas are still clearly visible in these 
false-color radar images obtained by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on board the space 
shuttle Endeavour. The image at the left was obtained using the 
L-band radar channel, horizontally received and vertically 
transmitted, on the shuttle's 39th orbit on October 2, 1994. The 
area shown is 45 kilometers by 71 kilometers (28 miles by 44 
miles) in size and centered at 44.6 degrees north latitude, 
110.7 degrees west longitude. North is toward the top of the 
image (to the right). Most trees in this area are lodgepole 
pines at different stages of fire succession. Yellowstone Lake 
appears as a large dark feature at the bottom of the scene.  At 
right is a map of the forest crown, showing its biomass, or 
amount of vegetation, which includes foliage and branches. The 
map was created by inverting SIR-C data and using in situ 
estimates of  crown biomass gathered by the Yellowstone National 
Biological Survey. The map is displayed on a color scale from 
blue (rivers and lakes with no biomass) to brown (non-forest 
areas with crown biomass of less than 4 tons per hectare) to 
light brown (areas of canopy burn with biomass of between 4 and 
12 tons per hectare). Yellow indicates areas of canopy burn and 
mixed burn with a biomass of between 12 to 20 tons per hectare; 
light green is mixed burn and non-burn forest with a biomass of 
20 to 35 tons per hectare; and green is non-burned forest with a 
biomass of greater than 35 tons per hectare. Forest recovery 
from the fire seems to depend on fire intensity and soil 
conditions.  In areas of severe canopy burn and poor soil 
conditions, crown biomass was still low in 1994 (indicated by 
the brown areas at the center left), whereas in areas of mixed 
burn with nutrient-rich soils, seen west of Yellowstone Lake, 
crown biomass has increased significantly in six years 
(indicated by the yellow and light green areas). Imaging fire-
affected regions with spaceborne radar illustrates SIR-C/X-SAR's 
keen abilities to monitor regrowth after a fire. Knowing the 
amount of carbon accumulated in the atmosphere by regenerating 
forest in the 20 to 50 years following a fire disturbance is 
also a significant factor in understanding the global carbon 
cycle. Measuring crown biomass is necessary to evaluate the 
effects of past and future fires in specific regions.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Baikal Forest, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Baikal Forest, Russia</H1>
<P>
This is an X-band black-and-white image of the forests east of 
the Baikal Forest in the Jablonowy Mountains of Russia.  The 
image is centered at 52.5 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees 
east longitude near the mining town of Bukatschatscha.  This 
image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
October 4, 1994, during the second flight of the spaceborne 
radar.  This area is part of an international research project 
known as the "Taiga Aerospace Investigation using Geographic 
Information System Applications." The focus of the 
investigations with respect to the SIR-C/X-SAR radar missions is 
to determine what additional information multi-frequency, multi-
polarization radar can provide to the study of the effects of 
fires in Russian boreal forests.  One of the principal areas of 
study in this research effort is monitoring the spatial and 
temporal distribution of the large-scale fires which occur in 
the Russian boreal forest, as well as the recovery of forests 
after a fire.  The northern boreal forests, called Taiga, are 
mainly spruce and fir trees.  This ecological setting is as 
important to the global carbon cycle as are the rainforests.  
The area to the east of Lake Baikal was selected as a test 
region for this study because of the large forest fires which 
have occurred in this area in the past.  For example, analysis 
of the advanced very high resolution radiometer data have shown 
that 14.5 million hectares (35.8 million acres) were affected by 
fire during the summer of 1987.  The Baikal Forest radar imaging 
pass was laid out to transect a large 1987 fire which had 
occurred just to the southeast of Lake Baikal.  This X-SAR image 
was obtained over a moderately mountainous region in 
southcentral Siberia to the east of Lake Baikal.  While much of 
the image intensity variations are the result of topographic 
effects, much of these variations are also due to differences in 
vegetation and forest cover.  This region is referred to as the 
Saibaikalsk Mountains middle taiga region of Siberia.  The 
dominant tree cover of this region is a combination of three 
coniferous species -- fir, spruce and pine -- with some 
deciduous species, aspen and birch, co-existing as understory or 
co-dominant species. Many of the differences in image intensity 
seen in this X-SAR image are due to differences in the 
distribution of tree species.  The distribution of trees 
throughout this region is very dependent on local site 
conditions. Fir and spruce are more dominant at lower elevations 
and in stream and river valleys, where higher soil moisture and 
more developed and fertile soil conditions exist.  In upland 
areas with better drainage and less developed soils, pine is the 
more dominant tree species in the overstory.  In addition to 
topography and soil conditions, another major factor in the 
development of forests in this region is the occurrence of 
wildfires.  Large wildfires (some reaching sizes of about 1 
million hectares or 2.47 million acres) are common in the 
region.  The X-SAR and SIR-C images collected over this region 
will be studied by a research team of scientists from Duke 
University in North Carolina, the Environmental Research 
Institute in Michigan and the International Forestry Institute 
in Krasnyarsk, Siberia.

<P>
This is  an X-SAR image spanning an area of approximately 20 
kilometers by 40 kilometers (12 miles by 25 miles) of the 
island of Hong Kong, the Kowloon Peninsula and the new 
territories in southern China, taken by the imaging radar on 
board the space shuttle Endeavour on October 4, 1994. North 
is toward the top left corner of the image. The Kaitak 
Airport runway on Kowloon Peninsula (center right of image) 
was built on reclaimed land and extends almost 3 kilometers 
(nearly 2 miles) into Victoria Harbor. To the south of the 
harbor lies the island of Hong Kong. The bright areas around 
the harbor are the major residential and business districts. 
Housing more than six million residents, Hong Kong is the 
most densely populated area in the world. The large number 
of objects visible in the harbor and surrounding waters are 
a variety of sea-going vessels, anchored in one of the 
busiest seaports in the Far East.

<H1>Kennedy Space Center closeup</H1>
<P>
This image was produced during radar observations taken by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar as it flew over the Gulf Stream, Florida, and past the 
Atlantic Ocean on October 7, 1994. The data were produced 
using the X-band radar frequency. Knowing ahead of time that 
this region would be included in a regularly scheduled radar 
pass, the Kennedy Space Center team, who assembled and 
integrated the SIR-C/X-SAR equipment with the Spacelab 
pallet system, designed a set of radar reflectors from 
common construction materials and formed the letters "KSC" 
on the ground adjacent to the main headquarters building at 
the entrance to the Cape Canaveral launch facility. The 
point of  light formed by the bright return from these 
reflectors are visible in the image.  Other more diffuse 
bright spots are reflections from building faces, 
roofs and other large structures at the Kennedy Space Center 
complex.  This frame covers an area of approximately 6 
kilometers by 8 kilometers (4 miles by 5 miles), which was 
just a small portion of the data taken on this particular 
pass.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - North Sea oil slick</TITLE>
<H1>North Sea oil slick</H1>
<P>
This is an X-band image of an oil slick experiment conducted in 
the North Sea, Germany. The image is centered at 54.58 degrees 
north latitude and 7.48 degrees east longitude. This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour 
on October 6, 1994, during the second flight of the spaceborne 
radar.  The experiment was designed to differentiate between 
petroleum oil spills and natural slicks floating on the sea 
surface. Two types of petroleum oil and six types of oils 
resembling natural sea surface slicks were poured on the sea 
surface from ships and a helicopter just before the space 
shuttle flew over the region. At the bottom of the image is the 
Sylt peninsula, a famous holiday resort. Twenty-six gallons (100 
liters) of diesel oil was dissipated due to wave action before 
the shuttle reached the site. The oil spill seen at the 
uppermost part of the image is about 105 gallons (400 liters) of 
heavy heating oil and the largest spill is about 58 gallons (220 
liters) of oleyl alcohol, resembling a "natural oil" like the 
remaining five spills used to imitate  natural slicks that have 
occurred offshore from various states.  The volume of these 
other oils spilled on the ocean surface during the five 
experimental spills varied from 16 gallons to 21 gallons (60 
liters to 80 liters).  The distance between neighboring spills 
was about half a mile (800 meters) at the most.  The largest 
slick later thinned out to monomolecular sheets of about 10 
millimeters, which is the dimension of a molecule. 
Oceanographers found that SIR-C/X-SAR was able to clearly 
distinguish the oil slicks from algae products dumped nearby. 
Preliminary indications are that various types of slicks may be 
distinguished, especially when other radar wavelengths are 
included in the analysis. Radar imaging of the world's oceans on 
a continuing basis may allow oceanographers in the future to 
detect and clean up oil spills much more swiftly than is 
currently possible.

<TITLE>SRL - Ubar Optical/Radar</TITLE>
<H1>Ubar Optical/Radar
</H1> 
<P> 
This pair of images from space shows a portion of the southern Empty
Quarter of the Arabian
Peninsula in the country of Oman. On the left is a radar image of the
region around the site of the
fabled Lost City of Ubar, discovered in 1992 with the aid of remote
sensing data. On the right is an
enhanced optical image taken by the shuttle astronauts. Ubar existed
from about 2800 BC to about
300 AD. and was a remote desert outpost where caravans were assembled
for the transport of
frankincense across the desert. The actual site of the fortress of the
Lost City of Ubar, currently under
excavation, is too small to show in either image. However, tracks
leading to the site, and surrounding
tracks, show as prominent, but diffuse, reddish streaks in the radar
image. Although used in modern
times, field investigations show many of these tracks were in use in
ancient times as well. Mapping of
these tracks on regional remote sensing images provided by the Landsat
satellite was a key to
recognizing the site as Ubar. The prominent magenta colored area is a
region of large sand dunes. The
green areas are limestone rocks, which form a rocky desert floor. A
major wadi, or dry stream bed,
runs across the scene and appears as a white line. The radar images, and
ongoing field investigations,
will help shed light on an early civilization about which little in
known. The radar image was taken
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) and is
centered at 18 degrees North latitude and 53 degrees East longitude. The
image covers an area about
50 kilometers by 100 kilometers (31 miles by 62 miles). The colors in
the image are assigned to
different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is
L-band, horizontally
transmitted, horizontally received; blue is C-band horizontally
transmitted, horizontally received;
green is L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received.
SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the
German, Italian and the United States space agencies, is part of NASA's
Mission to Planet Earth.

<TITLE>SRL - Patagonian Ice Fields</TITLE>
<H1>Patagonian Ice Fields
</H1> 
<P> 
This pair of images illustrates the ability of multi-parameter radar
imaging sensors such as the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band
Synthetic Aperture radar to detect climate- related changes on the
Patagonian ice fields in the Andes Mountains of Chile and
Argentina. The images show nearly the same area of the south Patagonian
ice field as it was imaged during two space shuttle flights in
1994 that were conducted five-and-a-half months apart. The images,
centered at 49.0 degrees south latitude and 73.5 degrees west
longitude, include several large outlet glaciers. The images were
acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR on board the space shuttle Endeavour
during April and October 1994. The top image was acquired on April 14,
1994, at 10:46 p.m. local time, while the bottom image was
acquired on October 5,1994, at 10:57 p.m. local time. Both were acquired
during the 77th orbit of the space shuttle. The area shown is
approximately 100 kilometers by 58 kilometers (62 miles by 36 miles)
with north toward the upper right. The colors in the images
were obtained using the following radar channels: red represents the
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green represents
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); blue represents the
L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received). The
overall dark tone of the colors in the central portion of the April
image indicates that the interior of the ice field is covered with thick
wet snow. The outlet glaciers, consisting of rough bare ice, are the
brightly colored yellow and purple lobes which terminate at calving
fronts into the dark waters of lakes and fiords. During the second
mission the temperatures were colder and the corresponding change
in snow and ice conditions is readily apparent by comparing the images.
The interior of the ice field is brighter because of increased
radar return from the dryer snow. The distinct green/orange boundary on
the ice field indicates an abrupt change in the structure of the
snowcap, a direct indication of the steep meteorological gradients known
to exist in this region. The bluer color of the outlet glaciers is
probably due to a thin snow cover. A portion of the terminus of the
outlet glacier at the top left center of the images has advanced
approximately 600 meters (1,970 feet) in the five-and-a-half months
between the two missions. Because of the persistent cloud cover
this observation was only possible by using the orbiting, remote imaging
radar system.

<TITLE>SRL- Mount Everest</TITLE>
<H1>Mount Everest</H1>
<P>

These are two comparison images of  Mount Everest and its 
surroundings, along the border of  Nepal and Tibet.  The peak 
of Mount Everest, the highest elevation on Earth at 8,848 
meters (29,028 feet), can be seen near the center of each 
image. The image at the top was acquired through thick cloud 
cover by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on April 16, 1994.  The image on the bottom is an 
optical photograph taken by the Endeavour crew under clear 
conditions during the second flight of SIR-C/X-SAR on October 
10, 1994.  Both images show an area approximately 70 
kilometers by 38 kilometers (43 miles by 24 miles) that is 
centered at 28.0 degrees north latitude and 86.9 degrees east 
longitude.   North is toward the upper left.  The colors in 
the radar image were obtained using the following radar 
channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted 
and received); green represents the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received); blue represents the C-
band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  
Radar illumination is from the top of the frame.  The optical 
photograph has been geometrically adjusted to better match 
the area shown in the radar image.  Many features of the 
Himalayan terrain are visible in both images.  Snow covered 
areas appear white in the optical photograph while the same 
areas appear bright blue in the radar image.  The radar image 
was taken in early spring and shows deep snow cover, while 
the optical  photograph was taken in late summer and shows 
minimum snow cover.  The curving and branching features seen 
in both images are glaciers.  The two wavelengths and 
multiple polarizations of the SIR-C radar are sensitive to 
characteristics of the glacier surfaces that are not detected 
by conventional photography, such as the ice roughness, water 
content and stratification.  For this reason, the glaciers 
show a variety of colors in the radar image (blue, purple, 
red, yellow, white) but only appear as gray or white in the 
photograph.  Field data from other SIR-C/X-SAR test sites, 
such as the Alpine glaciers of Austria, are being used to 
help interpret data from remote regions like Mount Everest.

<TITLE>SRL - Mammoth Mountain seasonal change</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth Mountain seasonal change</H1> 
<P> 
These two false-color composite imges of the Mammoth Mountain 
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Calif., show significant 
seasonal changes in snow cover.  The image at left was acquired 
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit on 
April 13, 1994.  The image is centered at 37.6 degrees north 
latitude and 119 degrees west longitude.  The area is about 36 
kilometers by 48 kilometers (22 miles by 29 miles).  In this 
image, red is L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received) polarization data; green is C-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received) polarization data; and blue 
is C-band (horizontally transmitted and received) polarization 
data.  The image at right was acquired on October 3, 1994, on 
the space shuttle Endeavour's 67th orbit of the second radar 
mission. Crowley Lake appears dark at the center left of the 
image, just above or south of Long Valley.  The Mammoth Mountain 
ski area is visible at the top right of the scene. The red areas 
correspond to forests, the dark blue areas are bare surfaces and 
the green areas are short vegetation, mainly brush.  The changes 
in color tone at the higher elevations (e.g. the Mammoth 
Mountain ski area) from green-blue in April to purple in 
September reflect changes in snow cover between the two 
missions.  The April mission occurred immediately following a 
moderate snow storm.  During the mission the snow evolved from a 
dry, fine-grained snowpack with few distinct layers to a wet, 
coarse-grained pack with multiple ice inclusions.  Since that 
mission, all snow in the area has melted except for small 
glaciers and permanent snowfields on the Silver Divide and near 
the headwaters of Rock Creek.  On October 3, 1994, only 
discontinuous patches of snow cover were present at very high 
elevations following the first snow storm of the season on 
September 28, 1994.  For investigations in hydrology and land-
surface climatology, seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are 
critical to the radiation and water balances.  SIR-C/X-SAR is a 
powerful tool because it is sensitive to most snowpack 
conditions and is less influenced by weather conditions than 
other remote sensing instruments, such as Landsat. In parallel 
with the operational SIR-C data processing, an experimental 
effort is being conducted to test SAR data processing using the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory's massively parallel supercomputing 
facility, centered around the Cray Research T3D.  These 
experiments will assess the abilities of large supercomputers to 
produce high throughput SAR processing in preparation for 
upcoming data-intensive SAR missions.  The images released here 
were produced as part of this experimental effort.

<TITLE>SRL - Manaus, Brazil</TITLE>
<H1>Manaus, Brazil</H1> 
<P> 
These L-band images of the Manaus region of Brazil were acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour.  The left image was acquired on

April 12, 1994, and the middle image was acquired on October 3, 1994. 
The area shown is approximately 8 kilometers by 40 kilometers (5 miles
by 25 miles). The two large rivers in this image, the Rio Negro (top) 
and the Rio Solimoes (bottom), combine at Manaus (west of the image) to
form the Amazon River. The image is centered at about 3 degrees south 
latitude and 61 degrees west longitude.  North is toward the top left of

the images. The differences in brightness between the images reflect 
changes in the scattering of the radar channel. In this case, the
changes are indicative of flooding. A flooded forest has a higher 
backscatter at L-band (horizontally transmitted and received) than an 
unflooded river. The extent of the flooding is much greater in the April

image than in the October image, and corresponds to the annual, 10-meter

(33-foot) rise and fall of the Amazon River. A third image at right 
shows the change in the April and October images and was created by 
determining which areas had significant decreases in the intensity of 
radar returns. These areas, which appear blue on the third image at 
right, show the dramatic decrease in the extent of flooded forest, 
as the level of the Amazon River falls. The flooded forest is a vital 
habitat for fish and floating meadows are an important source of 
atmospheric methane. This demonstrates the capability of SIR-C/X-SAR to
study important environmental changes that are impossible to see with 
optical sensors over regions such as the Amazon, where frequent cloud 
cover and dense forest canopies obscure monitoring of floods. Field 
studies by boat, on foot and in low-flying aircraft by the University of

California at Santa Barbara, in collaboration with Brazil's Instituto 
Nacional de Pesguisas Estaciais, during the first and second flights of
the SIR-C/X-SAR system have validated the interpretation of the radar 
images.

<TITLE>SRL - Manaus, Brazil L-band</TITLE>
<H1>Manaus, Brazil L-band</H1> 
<P> 
These two false-color images of the Manaus region of Brazil 
in South America were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on board the 
space shuttle Endeavour. The image at left was acquired on 
April 12, 1994, and the image at right was acquired on 
October 3, 1994.  The area shown is approximately 8 
kilometers by 40 kilometers (5 miles by 25 miles).  The two 
large rivers in this image, the Rio Negro (at top) and the 
Rio Solimoes (at bottom), combine at Manaus (west of the 
image) to form the Amazon River. The image is centered at 
about 3 degrees south latitude and 61 degrees west 
longitude.  North is toward the top left of the images.  The 
false colors were created by displaying three L-band 
polarization channels: red areas correspond to high 
backscatter, horizontally transmitted and received, while 
green areas correspond to high backscatter, horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received. Blue areas show low 
returns at vertical transmit/receive polarization; hence the 
bright blue colors of the smooth river surfaces can be seen. 
Using this color scheme, green areas in the image are 
heavily forested, while blue areas are either cleared forest 
or open water.  The yellow and red areas are flooded forest 
or floating meadows. The extent of the flooding is much 
greater in the April image than in the October image and 
appears to follow the 10-meter (33-foot) annual rise and 
fall of the Amazon River. The flooded forest is a vital 
habitat for fish, and floating meadows are an important 
source of atmospheric methane.  These images demonstrate the 
capability of SIR-C/X-SAR to study important environmental 
changes that are impossible to see with optical sensors over 
regions such as the Amazon, where frequent cloud cover and 
dense forest canopies block monitoring of flooding.  Field 
studies by boat, on foot and in low-flying aircraft by the

with Brazil's Instituto Nacional de Pesguisas Estaciais, 
during the first and second flights of the SIR-C/X-SAR

<TITLE>SRL - Prince Albert, Canada comparison</TITLE>
<H1>Prince Albert, Canada comparison</H1> 
<P> 
This is a comparison of images over Prince Albert, produced by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on its 20th orbit on April 10, 1994, and 
again on orbit 20 of the second flight of Endeavour on October 1, 1994.  
The area is centered at 53.91 degrees north latitude and 104.69 degrees 
west longitude and is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) north and 30 
kilometers (18.5 miles) east of the town of Prince Albert in the 
Saskatchewan province of Canada.  The image covers the area east of 
Candle Lake, between the gravel highway of 120 and west of highway 106.  
The area imaged is near the southern limit of the boreal forest.  The 
boreal forest of North America is a continuous vegetation belt at high 
latitudes stretching across the continent from the Atlantic shoreline of 
central Labrador and then westward across Canada to the interior 
mountains and central coastal plains of Alaska.  The forest is also part 
of a larger northern hemisphere circumpolar boreal forest belt. 
Coniferous trees dominate the entire forest but deciduous trees are also 
present.  During the month of April, the forest experiences seasonal 
changes from a frozen condition to a thawed condition. The trees are 
completely frozen over the winter season and the forest floor is covered 
by snow.  As the average temperature rises in the spring, the trees are 
thawed and the snow melts.  This transition has an impact on the rate of 
moisture evaporation and release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
In late September and early October, the boreal forest experiences a 
relatively different seasonal change.  At this time, the leaves on 
deciduous trees start changing color and dropping off.  The soil and 
trees are quite often moist due to frequent rainfall and cloud cover. 
The evaporation of moisture and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere also 
diminshes at this time.  SIR-C/X-SAR is sensitive to the moisture of 
soil and vegetation and can sense this freeze-thaw cycle and the summer-
fall seasonal transition over forested areas in particular.  Optical 
sensors, by contrast, are blind to these regions, which are perpetually 
obscured by thick cloud cover. These changes were detected by comparing 
the April and October color composite images of L-band data in red, C-
band data in green and X-band (vertically received and transmitted) in 
blue. The changes in intensity of each color over lakes, various forest 
stands and clear cuts in the two images is striking. Lakes such as Lake 
Heiberg, Crabtree Lake and Williams Lake, in the right middle part of 
the image, are frozen in April (appearing in bright blue) and melted 
(appearing in black) in October. The higher intensity of blue over lakes 
in April is due to low penetration of the X-band (vertically received 
and transmitted) and the radar's high sensitivity to surface features.  
Forest stands also exhibit major changes between the two images.  The 
red areas in the October image are old jack pine canopies that cause 
higher return at L-band because of their moist condition in late summer 
compared to their partially frozen condition in April (in purple).  
Similarly, in the areas near the middle of the image, where black spruce 
and mixed aspen and jack pine trees dominate, the contrast between blue 
in October and red and green in April is an indication that the top of 
the canopy (needles and branches) were frozen in April and moist in 
October.  The changes due to deforestation by logging companies or 
natural fires can also be detected by comparing the images.  For 
example, the small blue area near the intersection of Harding Road and 
Highway 120 is the result of logging which occurred after the April data 
was acquired.  The surface area of clear cut is approximately 4 
hectares, which is calculated from the high-resolution capability of the 
radar images and verified by scientists participating in fieldwork 
during the mission.

These are color composite radar images showing the area around Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The images were acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 (left image) and  October 
5,1994 (right image). The images are centered at about 15 degrees north 
latitude and 120.5 degrees east longitude. Both images were obtained 
with the same viewing geometry. The color composites were made by 
displaying the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received) in red; 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in green; 
and the C-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in 
blue.  The area shown is approximately 40 kilometers by 65 kilometers 
(25 miles by 40 miles). The main volcanic crater on Mount Pinatubo 
produced by the June 1991 eruptions and the steep slopes on the upper 
flanks of the volcano are easily seen in these images. Red on the high 
slopes shows the distribution of the ash deposited during the 1991 
eruption, which appears red because of the low cross-polarized radar 
returns at C and L bands. The dark drainages radiating away from the 
summit are the smooth mudflows, which even three years after the 
eruptions continue to flood the river valleys after heavy rain. 
Comparing the two images shows that significant changes have occured in 
the intervening five months along the Pasig-Potrero rivers (the dark 
area in the lower right of the images).  Mudflows, called "lahars," that 
occured during the 1994 monsoon season filled the river valleys, 
allowing the lahars to spread over the surrounding countryside. Three 
weeks before the second image was obtained, devastating lahars more than 
doubled the area affected in the Pasig-Potrero rivers, which is clearly 
visible as the increase in dark area on the lower right of the images. 
Migration of deposition to the east (right) has affected many 
communities. Newly affected areas included the community of Bacolor, 
Pampanga, where thousands of homes were buried in meters of hot mud and 
rock as 80,000 people fled the lahar-stricken area.  Scientists are 
closely monitoring the westward migration ( toward the left in this 
image) of the lahars as the Pasig-Potrero rivers seek to join with the 
Porac River, an area that has not seen laharic activity since the 
eruption.  This could  be devastating because the Pasig-Potrero rivers 
might be permanently redirected to lower elevations along the Porac 
River where communities are located. Ground saturation with water during 
the rainy season reveals inactive channels that were dry in the April 
image. A small lake has turned into a pond in the lower reaches of the 
Potrero River because the channels are full of lahar deposits and the 
surface runoff has no where to flow. Changes in the degree of erosion in 
ash and pumice deposits from the 1991 eruption can also be seen in the 
channels that deliver the mudflow material to the Pasig-Potrero rivers. 
The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption is well known for its near-global 
effects on the atmosphere and short-term climate due to the large amount 
of sulfur dioxide that was injected into the upper atmosphere. Locally, 
however, the effects will most likely continue to impact surrounding 
areas for as long as the next 10 to 15 years. Mudflows, quite certainly, 
will continue to pose severe hazards to adjacent areas. Radar 
observations like those obtained by SIR-C/X-SAR will play a key role in 
monitoring these changes because of the radar's ability to see in 
daylight or darkness and even in the worst weather conditions.  Radar 
imaging will be particularly useful, for example, during the monsoon 
season, when the lahars form.  Frequent imaging of these lahar fields 
will allow scientists to better predict when they are likely to begin 
flowing again and which communities might be at risk.

<TITLE>SRL - Raco, Michigan seasonal change</TITLE>
<H1>Raco, Michigan seasonal change</H1> 
<P> 
These are two false-color composites of Raco, Michigan, located 
at the eastern end of Michigan's upper peninsula, west of Sault 
Ste. Marie and south of Whitefish Bay on Lake Superior. The two 
images (centered at 46.39 degrees north latitude, 84.88 degrees 
west longitude) show significant seasonal changes in the mid-
latitude region of mixed deciduous and coniferous forests. The 
images were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-
band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the shuttle 
Endeavour on the sixth orbit of each mission. In these images, 
red is L-band (23 cm) with horizontal/vertical polarization; 
green is C-band (6 cm) with horizontal/vertical polarization; 
blue is C-band with horizontal/horizontal polarization.  The 
region shown is largely forested and includes a large portion of 
Hiawatha National Forest, as well as an agricultural region near 
the bottom of each image. In early April, the area was snow-
covered with up to 50 centimeters (19.5 inches) of snow in 
forest clearings and agricultural fields.  Buds had not yet 
broken on deciduous trees, but the trees were not frozen and sap 
was generally flowing.  Lake Superior, in the upper right, and 
the small inland lakes were frozen and snow-covered on April 9, 
1994.  By the end of September, deciduous trees were just 
beginning to change color after a relatively wet period.  Leaf 
loss was estimated at about 30 percent, depending on the 
species, and the soil was moist to wet after a heavy rainfall on 
September 28, 1994.  Most agricultural fields were covered with 
grasses of up to 60 centimeters (23 inches) in height.  In the 
two images the colors are related to the types of landcover 
(i.e. vegetation type) and the brightness is related to the 
amount of plant material and its relative moisture content.  
Significant seasonal changes between early spring and early fall 
are illustrated by this pair of images.  For the agricultural 
region near the bottom of the images, the change from snow-cover 
to moist soil with short vegetation cover is shown by the color 
change from blue to green and blue.  The green color corresponds 
to significant increases in vegetation cover and field-to-field 
differences in blue are the result of differences in surface 
roughness and soil moisture.  In the forested areas, many of the 
conifer forests appear similar in both images (red pine forests 
appear red in both images).  However, there is more blue and 
green in the September 30, 1994 image as a consequence of 
greater foilage and more moisture in the forest crowns.  Lowland 
conifer forests (spruce and northern white cedars) appear as 
bright green in both images.  Deciduous forests produce very 
strong radar returns at these frequencies and polarization 
combinations, resulting in a nearly white appearance on the 
images (the specific color mix is related to the local species 
mix).  In the September 30, 1994 image, the areas of deciduous 
forest appear darker than in the April image because of the 
weaker radar signal from the foliage in the crown layer.  The 
clear-cut areas (shown in April by the irregularly shaped dark 
areas in the center) change dramatically in appearance due to 
loss of snow cover and increases in soil moisture and vegetation 
cover by the end of September.

<TITLE>SRL - Altona, Manitoba, Canada</TITLE>
<H1>Altona, Manitoba, Canada</H1> 
<P> 
This is an X-band seasonal image of the Altona test site in 
Manitoba, Canada, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of 
Winnipeg. The image is centered at approximately 49
degrees north latitude and 97.5 degrees west longitude. This 
image was acquired by the   Spaceborne  Imaging Radar-C and 
X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)  aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on April 11, 1994, during the first 
flight of the radar system, and on October 2, 1994, during 
the second flight of SIR-C/X-SAR. The image channels have 
the following color assignements: red represents data 
acquired on April 11, 1994; green represents data acquired 
on October 2, 1994; blue represents the ratio of the two 
data sets. The test site is located in the Red River Basin 
and is characterized by rich farmland where a variety of 
crops are grown, including wheat, barley, canola, corn,  
sunflowers and sugar beets. This SIR-C/X-SAR research site 
is applying radar remote sensing to study the 
characteristics of vegetation and soil moisture. The 
seasonal comparison between the April and October 1994 data 
show the dramatic differences between surface conditions on 
the two dates. At the time of the April acquisition, almost 
all agricultural fields were bare and soil moisture levels 
were high.  In October, however, soils were drier and while 
most crops had been harvested, some standing vegetation was 
still present. The areas which are cyan in color are dark in 
April and bright in October. These represent fields of 
standing biomass (amount of vegetation in a specified area) 
and the differences in brightness within these cyan fields 
represent differences in vegetation type. The very bright 
fields in October represent standing broadleaf crops such as 
corn, which had not yet been harvested. Other standing 
vegetation which has less biomass, such as hay and grain 
fields, are less bright. The magenta indicates bare soil 
surfaces which were wetter (brighter) in April than in 
October. The variations in brightness of the magenta 
indicate differences in the degree of soil moisture change 
and differences in surface roughness. This seasonal 
composite demonstrates the sensitivity of radar to changes 
in agricultural surface conditions such as soil moisture, 
tillage, cropping and harvesting.

<TITLE>SRL - Bebedouro, Brazil</TITLE>
<H1>Bebedouro, Brazil</H1> 
<P> 
This is an X-band image showing seasonal changes at the 
hydrological test site of Bebedouro in Brazil. The image is 
centered at 9 degrees south latitude and 40.2 degrees west 
longitude. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994, during the first 
flight of the radar system, and on October 1, 1994, during the 
second mission. The swath width is approximately 16.5 kilometers 
(10.5 miles) wide. The image channels have the following color 
assignments: red represents data acquired on April 10; green 
represents data acquired on October 1; blue corresponds to the 
ratio of the two data sets. Agriculture plays an important 
economic and social role in Brazil. One of the major problems 
related to Brazilian agriculture is estimating the size of 
planting areas and their productivity.  Due to cloud cover and 
the rainy season, which occurs from November through April, 
optical and infrared Earth observations are seldom used to 
survey the region.  An additional goal of monitoring this region 
is to watch the floodplains of rivers like Rio Sao Francisco in 
order to determine suitable locations for additional 
agricultural fields.  This area belongs to the semi-arid 
northeastern region of Brazil, where estimates have suggested 
that about 10 times more land could be used for agriculture, 
including some locations which could be used for irrigation 
projects. Monitoring of soil moisture during the important 
summer crop season is of high priority for the future 
development and productivity of this region. In April the area 
was covered with vegetation because of the moisture of the soil 
and only small differences could be seen in X-band data. In 
October the run-off channels of this hilly region stand out 
quite clearly because the greenish areas indicated much less 
soil moisture and water content in plants.

<TITLE>SRL - Maly Semlyachik Volcano, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Maly Semlyachik Volcano, Russia</H1> 
<P> 
This is an X-band seasonal image of the Maly Semlyachik volcano, 
which is part of the Karymsky volcano group on Kamchatka 
peninsula, Russia. The image is centered at 54.2 degrees north 
latitude and 159.6 degrees east longitude. This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour 
on  April 9, 1994, during the first flight of the radar system, 
and on September 30, 1994, during the second flight. The image 
channels have been assigned the following colors: red 
corresponds to data acquired on April 9; green corresponds to 
data acquired on September 30; and blue corresponds to the ratio 
between data from April 9 and September 30, 1994. Kamchatka is 
twice as large as England, Scotland and Wales combined and is 
home to approximately 470,000 residents. The region is 
characterized by a chain of volcanoes stretching 800 kilometers 
(500 miles) across the countryside.  Many of the volcanoes, 
including the active Maly Semlyachik volcano in this image, have 
erupted during this century. But the most active period in 
creating the three characteristic craters of this volcano goes 
back 20,000, 12,000 and 2,000 years ago. The highest summit of 
the oldest crater reaches about 1,560 meters (1,650 feet). The 
radar images reveal the geological structures of craters and 
lava flows in order to improve scientists' knowledge of these 
sometimes vigorously active volcanoes. This seasonal composite 
also highlights the ecological differences that have occurred 
between April and October 1994.  In April the whole area was 
snow-covered and, at the coast, an ice sheet extended 
approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) into the sea. The area 
shown surrounding the volcano is covered by low vegetation much 
like scrub. Kamchatka also has extensive forests, which belong 
to the northern frontier of Taiga, the boreal forest ecosystem.  
This region plays an important role in the world's carbon cycle. 
Trees require  60 years to mature in Kamchatka's 120-day growing 
season. The forest industry is managing these forests and 
practicing selective cutting to allow younger trees time to grow 
and reseed.  X-SAR images will aid in mapping these deforested 
areas and in encouraging further recultivation efforts.

<TITLE>SRL - Mende, France</TITLE>
<H1>Mende, France</H1>
<P>
This is an X-band seasonal image of the central part of Lozere 
Departement situated south of the Massif Central in France. The 
image is 10 kilometers by 25 kilometers (6 miles by 15.5 miles) 
and is centered at approximately 44.3 degrees north latitude and 
3 degrees east longitude.  This image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 
aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 15, 1994 and on 
October 6, 1994.  The image channels have the following color 
assignments: red was acquired in April; green was acquired in 
October; and blue is the ratio of the two data sets combined.  
Seasonal differences in the vegetation are visible in pink, 
which are heaths growing in the spring.  This research area 
features two large limestone plateaus cut by the famous Gorges 
du Tarn, standing in parallel with the granite mountain range 
known as  the Cevennes Mountains nearby.  Land-use consists 
mainly of grasslands, heaths and forests.  Forest types seen in 
the images are Austrian pines, Scots pines, spruce, fir and 
beech trees.  Most forests were planted at the end of the 19th 
century through a national reforestation program aimed at 
reducing the strong erosion risks in these areas.  This program 
was so successful that today the forests are exploited for 
forest pulpwood and sawlogs, but also remain protected as 
conservation regions. The study being performed in this area 
will assess the potential of spaceborne radar remote sensing for 
temperate forest type mapping and forest resource monitoring.  
The combination of X-band SAR data with lower frequency data 
(such as the SIR-C L-band data) allows scientists to distinguish 
forest tree species and biomass, or areas of ground vegetation. 
The lessons learned from the radar images of these controlled 
forest regions can be applied to larger areas and naturally 
grown forests to help ecologists protect and maintain them.  The 
SIR-C/X-SAR images will be investigated by scientists from th 
remote sensing laboratory Cemagref in Montpellier and the 
National Foresty Board in Mende, France.

<TITLE>SRL - Oetztal, Austria</TITLE>
<H1>Oetztal, Austria</H1> 
<P> 
This is a digital elevation model that was geometrically 
coded directly onto an X-band seasonal change image of the 
Oetztal supersite in Austria.  The image is centered at 
46.82 degrees north latitude and 10.79 degrees east 
longitude.  This image is located in the Central Alps at the 
border between Switzerland, Italy and Austria, 50 kilometers 
(31 miles) southwest of Innsbruck.  It was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 and on October 
5, 1994.  It was produced by combining data from these two 
different data sets. Data obtained in April is green; data 
obtained in October appears in red and blue, and was used as 
an enhancement based on the ratio of the two data sets.  
Areas with a decrease in backscatter from April to October 
appear in light blue (cyan), such as the large 
Gepatschferner glacier seen at the left of the image center, 
and most of the other glaciers in this view.  A light blue 
hue is also visible at the east border of the dark blue Lake 
Reschensee at the upper left side.  This shows a significant 
rise in the water level.  Magenta represents areas with an 
increase of backscatter from April 10 to October 5. Yellow 
indicates areas with high radar signal response during both 
passes, such as the mountain slopes facing the radar.  Low 
radar backscatter signals refer to smooth surface (lakes) or 
radar grazing areas to radar shadow areas, seen in the 
southeast slopes.  The area is approximately 29 kilometers 
by 21 kilometers (18 miles by 13.5 miles).  The summit of 
the main peaks reaches elevations of 3,500 to 3,768 meters 
(xx feet to xx feet) above sea level.  The test site's core 
area is the glacier region of Venter Valley, which is one of 
the most intensively studied areas for glacier research in 
the world.  Research in Venter Valley (below center) 
includes studies of glacier dynamics, glacier-climate 
regions, snowpack conditions and glacier hydrology.  About 
25 percent of the core test site is covered by glaciers.  
Corner reflectors are set up for calibration.  Five corner 
reflectors can be seen on the Gepatschferner and two can be 
seen on the Vernagtferner.

<TITLE>SRL - Raco, Michigan X-band seasonal change</TITLE>
<H1>Raco, Michigan X-band seasonal change</H1> 
<P> 
This is an X-band image of seasonal changes at the ecological 
test site of Raco, Michigan, located south of Whitefish Bay on 
Lake Superior. The image is centered at about 46 degrees north 
latitude and 85 degrees west longitude. This image was acquired 
by the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar onboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on April 10th, 1994, and on October 1, 1994. The areas 
shown in red correspond to the April 10th data; the areas in 
blue correspond to data acquired on October 1, 1994; green 
indicates the ratio of data acquired on April 10 and October 1, 
1994.  The area shown is 22.7 kilometers by 53 kilometers (14 
miles by 33 miles). Lake Superior in the upper right was frozen 
in April and had small waves (ripples) on its surface in 
October.  The land area contains mostly forests and, to a lesser 
extent, agricultural regions. In April the area was covered in 
wet snow. By October, there agricultural areas were covered with 
grass.  Vegetation and soils were moist due to rainfalls three 
days before the data was acquired on October 1, 1994. The bright 
light green/yellow tones in the lower half of the image show the 
stronger reflections of the snow-covered agricultural fields.  
The pinkish color corresponds to the coniferous and deciduous 
forests.  The green area represents red pines.  These trees are 
smaller than the surrounding forest cover and allow more radar 
penetration. The area is green because the radar is sensing the 
surface, which undergoes great change from snow to grass and 
fern undergrowth between April and October.  The bright green 
triangle in the upper half of the image is an old airstrip, 
while the modern airport can be seen on the bottom right side of 
the image. The Raco site is an important location for monitoring 
seasonal changes and future global change because it is situated 
at the ecological transition zone between the boreal forests and 
the northern temperate forests.  This transitional zone is 
expected to be ecologically sensitive to anticipated global 
changes resulting from climatic warming. Baseline studies of 
vegetation are essential in monitoring these expected changes.

<H1>Washington, D.C.</H1> 
<P>
The city of Washington, D.C., is shown is this space radar image. 
Images like these are useful tools for urban planners and 
managers, who use them to map and monitor land use patterns.  
Downtown Washington is the bright area between the Potomac (upper 
center to lower left) and Anacostia (middle right) rivers.  The 
dark cross shape that is formed by the National Mall, Tidal 
Basin, the White House and Ellipse is seen in the center of the 
image. 
Arlington National Cemetery is the dark blue area on the Virginia 
(left) side of the Potomac River near the center of the image. 
The Pentagon is visible in bright white and red, south of the 
cemetery.  Due to the alignment of  the radar and the streets, 
the avenues that form the boundary between Washington and 
Maryland appear as bright red lines in the top, right and bottom 
parts of the image, parallel to the image borders.  This image is 
centered at 38.85 degrees north latitude, 77.05 degrees west 
longitude. North is toward the upper right.  The area shown is 
approximately 29 km by 26 km (18 miles by 16 miles).  Colors are 
assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar 
as follows:  Red is the L-band horizontally transmitted, 
horizontally received; green is the L-band horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received; blue is the C-band horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received. The image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture (SIR-C/X-
SAR) imaging radar when it flew aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour  on April 18, 1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the 
German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of 
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.

<H1>North Ecuador volcanoes</H1> 
<P>
A family of dormant volcanoes dominates the landscape in this 
radar image of the Andes Mountains in northern Ecuador.  The city 
of Otavalo, shown in pink, and Lake Otavalo lie within the 
triangle formed by three volcanoes in the upper part of the 
image.  These volcanoes are, clockwise from upper left, Mojanda, 
Imabura and Cusin.  A lake partially fills the summit crater of 
Mojanda and a group of lava domes can be seen on the north flank.  
Geologists believe the most recent eruption of Mojanda was about 
3,400 years ago.  Much more recent activity has occurred at 
Cayambe, the large volcano at the bottom of the image.  Massive 
mudflow deposits can be seen filling the valleys on the east 
(right) side of Cayambe. Cayambe last erupted about 600 years 
ago.  Geologists are using radar to study volcanoes in the Andes 
to determine the history of eruptions and to identify potential 
threats the volcanoes pose to local communities. This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour 
on April 14, 1994.  The image is centered at 0.1 degrees
north latitude, 78.1 degrees west longitude.  The area shown is 
approximately 50 km by 50 km (31 miles by 31 miles).  North is 
toward the upper right.  Colors are assigned to different 
frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows:  red  is 
L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received; green is L-
band horizontally transmitted, vertically received; and blue is  
C-band horizontally transmitted, horizontally received. SIR-C/X-

<H1>Sudan Collision Zone</H1> 
<P>
This is a radar image of a region in northern Sudan called the 
Keraf Suture that reveals newly discovered geologic features 
buried beneath layers of  sand. This discovery is being used to 
guide field studies of the region and has opened up new 
perspectives on old problems, such as what controls the course of 
the Nile, a question that has perplexed geologists for centuries. 
The Nile is the yellowish/green line that runs from the top to 
the bottom of the image.  A small town, Abu Dis, can be seen as 
the bright, white area on the east (right) bank of the Nile 
(about a third of the way down from the top) at the mouth of a 
dry stream valley or 'wadi' that drains into the river.  Wadis 
flowing into the Nile from both east and west stand out as dark, 
reddish branch-like drainage patterns.  The bright pink area on 
the west (left) side of the Nile is a region where rocks are 
exposed, but the area east (right) of the Nile is obscured by 
layers of sand, a few inches to several feet thick.  Virtually 
everything visible on the right side of this radar image is 
invisible when standing on the ground or when viewing photographs 
or satellite images such as the United States' Landsat or the 
French SPOT satellite. A sharp, straight fault cuts diagonally 
across the image, to the right of the Nile river.  The area 
between the fault and the Nile is part of the collision zone 
where the ancient continents of  East and West Gondwana crashed 
into each other to form the supercontinent Greater Gondwana more 
than 600 million years ago.  On this image, the Nile approaches 
but never crosses the fault, indicating that this fault seems to 
be controlling the course of the Nile in this part of  Sudan. The 
image is centered at 19.5 degrees north latitude, 33.35 degrees 
east longitude, and shows an area approximately 18 km by 20 km 
(10 miles by 12 miles).  The colors in the image are assigned to 
different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: 
Red is L-band, vertically transmitted and vertically received; 
green is L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received; and blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) 
when it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour in April 1994.

States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<H1>Pishan, China</H1>
<P>
This radar image is centered near the small town of Pishan in northwest China, about 280 km (174 miles) southeast of the city of  Kashgar along the ancient Silk Route in the Taklamakan desert of  the Xinjiang Province. Geologists are using this radar image as a map to study past climate changes and tectonics of  the area.  The irregular lavender branching patterns in the center of the image are the remains of ancient alluvial fans, gravel deposits that have accumulated at the base of the mountains during times of wetter climate. The subtle striped pattern cutting across the ancient fans are caused by thrusting of the Kun Lun Mountains north. This motion is caused by the continuing plate-tectonic collision of India with Asia.  Modern fans show up as large lavender triangles above the ancient fan deposits. Yellow areas on the modern fans are vegetated oases.  The gridded pattern results from the alignment of poplar trees that have been planted as wind breaks. The reservoir at the top of the image is part of a sophisticated irrigation system that supplies water to the oases. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour in April 1994. This image is centered at 37.4 degrees north latitude, 78.3 degrees east 
longitude and shows an area approximately 50 km by 100 km (31 miles by 62 miles). The colors are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows:  Red is L-band horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received; and blue is  C-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received.

<H1>Lisbon, Portugal</H1> 
<P>
This radar image of Lisbon, Portugal illustrates the different 
land use patterns that are present in coastal Portugal.  Lisbon, 
the national capital, lies on the north bank of the Rio Tejo 
where the river enters the Atlantic Ocean.  The city center 
appears as the bright area in the center of the image.  The green 
area west of the city center is a large city park called the 
Parque Florestal de Monsanto.  The Lisbon Airport is visible east 
of the city.   The Rio Tejo forms a large bay just east of the 
city.  Many agricultural fields are visible as a patchwork 
pattern east of the bay.  Suburban housing can be seen on the 
southern bank of the river.  Spanning the river is the Ponte 25 
de Abril, a large suspension bridge similar in architecture to 
San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.  The image was acquired on 
April 19, 1994 and is centered at 38.8 degrees north latitude, 
9.2 degrees west longitude.  North is towards the upper right.  
The image is 50 kilometers by 30 kilometers (31 miles by 19 
miles).  The colors in this image represent the following radar 
channels and polarizations:  red is L-band, horizontally 
transmitted and received; green is L-band, horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received; and blue is C-band, 
horizontally transmitted and vertically received.  SIR-C/X-SAR, a

<H1>Dublin, Ireland</H1> 
<P>
This radar image of Dublin, Ireland, shows how the radar 
distingishes between densely populated urban areas and nearby 
areas that are relatively unsettled.  In the center of the image 
is the city's natural harbor along the Irish Sea. The pinkish 
areas in the center are the densely populated parts of the city 
and the blue/green areas are the suburbs. The two ends of the 
Dublin Bay are Howth Point, the circular peninsula near the upper 
right side of the image, and Dun Laoghaire, the point to the 
south.  The small island just north of Howth is called "Ireland's 
Eye," and the larger island, near the upper right corner of the 
image is Lambay Island.  The yellow/green mountains in the lower 
left of the image (south) are the Wicklow Mountains.  The large 
lake in the lower left, nestled within these mountains, is the 
Poulaphouca Reservoir along River Liffey.  The River Liffey, the 
River Dodden and the Tolka River are the three rivers that flow 
into Dublin.  The straight features west of the city are the 
Grand Canal and the three rivers are the faint lines above and 
below these structures. The dark X-shaped feature just to the 
north of the city is the Dublin International Airport.  The image 
was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic 
Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR) when it flew aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on April 11, 1994.   This area is centered at 53.3 
degrees north latitude, 6.2 degrees west longitude. The area 
shown is approximately 55 kilometers by 42 kilometers (34 miles 
by 26 miles). The colors are assigned to different frequencies 
and polarizations of the radar as follows:  Red is L-band 
horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band 
vertically transmitted, vertically received; and blue is C-band 
vertically transmitted, vertically received.  SIR-C/X-SAR, a

<H1>North Atlantic Ocean</H1> 
<P> 
This is a radar image showing surface features on the open ocean in 
the northeast Atlantic Ocean. There is no land mass in this image. 
The purple line in the lower left of the image is the stern wake of a 
ship. The ship creating the wake is the bright white spot on the 
middle, left side of the image. The ship's wake is about 28 
kilometers (17 miles) long in this image and investigators believe 
that is because the ship may be discharging oil. The oil makes the 
wake last longer and causes it to stand out in this radar image. A 
fairly sharp boundary or front extends from the lower left to the 
upper right corner of the image and separates two distinct water 
masses that have different temperatures. The different water 
temperature affects the wind patterns on the ocean.  In this image, 
the light green area depicts rougher water with more wind, while the 
purple area is calmer water with less wind.   The dark patches are 
smooth areas of low wind, probably related to clouds along the front, 
and the bright green patches are likely due to ice crystals in the 
clouds that scatter the radar waves. The overall "fuzzy" look of this 
image is caused by long ocean waves, also called swells.  Ocean radar 
imagery allows the fine detail of ocean features and interactions to 
be seen, such as the wake, swell, ocean front and cloud effects, 
which can then be used to enhance the understanding of ocean dynamics 
on smaller and smaller scales.  The image is centered at 42.8 degrees 
north latitude, 26.2 degrees west longitude and shows an area 
approximately 35 kilometers by 65 kilometers (22 by 40 miles).  The 
colors in the image are assigned to different frequencies and 
polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L-band horizontally 
transmitted, horizontally received; green is C-band horizontally 
transmitted, horizontally received; blue is L-band vertically 
transmitted, vertically received.  This image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR) imaging radar when it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
April 11, 1994.  SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian 
and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet 
Earth.

Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The radars 
illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at 
any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. SIR-C/X-SAR 
uses three microwave wavelengths:  L-band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and 
X-band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the 
international scientific community to better understand the global 
environment and how it is changing. The SIR-C/X-SAR data, 
complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists 
clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by 
nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C 
was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. X-SAR was 
developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the German 
space agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), 
and the Italian space agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), with 
the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft und Raumfahrt e.v.(DLR), the 
major partner in science, operations, and data processing of X-SAR.

<H1>Salt Lake City, Utah</H1>
<P>
This radar image of Salt Lake City, Utah, illustrates the different land use patterns that are present in the Utah Valley.  Salt Lake City lies between the shores of the Great Salt Lake (the dark area on the left side of the image) and the Wasatch Front Range (the mountains in the upper half of the image). The Salt Lake City area is of great interest to urban planners because of the combination of lake, valley and alpine environments that coexist in the region. Much of the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake is a waterfowl management area.  The green grid pattern in the right center of  the image is Salt Lake City and its surrounding communities. The Salt Lake City airport is visible as the brown rectangle near the center of the image.  Interstate Highway 15 runs from the middle right edge to the upper left of the image.  The bright white patch east of Interstate 15 is the downtown area, including Temple Square and the state capitol. The University of Utah campus is the yellowish area that lies at the base of the mountains, east of Temple Square.  The large reservoir in the lower left center is a mine tailings pond. The semi-circular feature in the mountains at the bottom edge of the image is the Kennecott Copper Mine. The area shown is 60 kilometers by 40 kilometers (37 miles by 25 miles) and is centered at 40.6 degrees north latitude, 112.0 degrees west longitude. North is toward the upper left. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994.  The colors in this image represent the following radar channels and polarizations: red is L-band, horizontally transmitted and received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received; and blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received.

<H1>Florence, Italy</H1>
<P>
This radar image shows land use patterns in and around the city of Florence, Italy, shown here in the center of the image. Florence is situated on a plain in the Chianti Hill region of Central Italy. The Arno River flows through town and is visible as the dark line running from the upper right to the bottom center of the image. The city is home to some of the world's most famous art museums. The bridges seen crossing the Arno, shown as faint red lines in the upper right portion of the image, were all sacked during World War II with the exception of the Ponte Vecchio, which remains as Florence's only covered bridge. The large, black V-shaped feature near the center of the image is the Florence Railroad Station.   This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian, and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.  This image is centered at 43.7 degrees north latitude and 11.15 degrees east longitude with North toward the upper left of the image.  The area shown measures 20 kilometers by 17 kilometers (12.4 miles by 10.6 miles). The colors in the image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L-band horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Giza, with blowup</TITLE>
<H1>Giza, with blowup
</H1>
<P>
This radar image shows the area west of the Nile River near Cairo,
Egypt. The Nile River is the dark
band along the right side of the image and it flows approximately due
North from the bottom to the
right. The boundary between dense urbanization and the desert can be
clearly seen between the bright
and dark areas in the center of the image. This boundary represents the
approximate extent of yearly
Nile flooding which played an important part in determining where people
lived in ancient Egypt.
This land usage pattern persists to this day. The pyramids at Giza
appear as three bright triangles
aligned with the image top just at the boundary of the urbanized area.
They are also shown enlarged in
the inset box in the top left of the image. The Great Pyramid of Khufu
(Cheops in Greek) is the
northern most of the three Giza pyramids. The side-looking radar
illuminates the scene from the top,
the two sides of the pyramids facing the radar reflect most of the
energy back to the antenna and
appear radar bright; the two sides away from the radar reflect less
energy back and appear dark Two
additional pyramids can be seen left of center in the lower portion of
the image. The modern
development in the desert on the left side of the image is the Sixth of
October City, an area of
factories and residences started by Anwar Sadat to relieve urban
crowding. The image was taken on
April 19, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the shuttle Endeavour. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission
of the German,
Italian and the United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission
to Planet Earth. The image is
centered on latitude 29.72 degrees North latitude and 30.83 degrees East
longitude. The area shown is
approximately 20 kilometers by 30 kilometers. The colors in the image
are assigned to different
frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L-band
horizontally transmitted,
horizontally received; green is C-band horizontally transmitted,
horizontally received; blue is
C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Great Wall of China</TITLE>
<H1>Great Wall of China
</H1>
<P>

These radar images show two segments of the Great Wall of China in a
desert region of north-central
China, about 700 kilometers (434 miles) west of Beijing. The wall
appears as a thin orange band,
running from the top to the bottom of the left image, and from the
middle upper-left to the
lower-right of the right image. These segments of the Great Wall were
constructed in the 15th
century, during the Ming Dynasty. The wall is between 5 and 8 meters
high (16 to 26 feet) in these
areas. The entire wall is about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) long and
about 150 kilometers (93
miles) of the wall appear in these two images. The wall is easily
detected from space by radar because
its steep, smooth sides provide a prominent surface for reflection of
the radar beam. Near the center
of the left image, two dry lake beds have been developed for salt
extraction. Rectangular patterns in
both images indicate agricultural development, primarily wheat fields.
The images were acquired by
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the
space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission
of the German, Italian
and the United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to
Planet Earth. The left image is
centered at 37.7 degrees North latitude and 107.5 degrees East
longitude. The right image is centered
at 37.5 degrees North latitude and 108.1 degrees East longitude. North
is toward the upper right. Each
area shown measures 25 kilometers by 75 kilometers (15.5 miles by 45.5
miles). The colors in the
image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the
radar as follows: red is L- band
horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L- band
horizontally transmitted, vertically
received; blue is C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Vesuvius, Italy</TITLE>
<H1>Vesuvius, Italy
</H1>
<P>
Mt. Vesuvius, one of the best known volcanoes in the world primarily for
the eruption that buried the Roman city of Pompeii, is
shown in the center of this radar image. The central cone of Vesuvius is
the dark purple feature in the center of the volcano. This
cone is surrounded on the northern and eastern sides by the old crater
rim, called Mt. Somma. Recent lava flows are the pale
yellow areas on the southern and western sides of the cone. Vesuvius is
part of a large volcanic zone which includes the
Phalagrean Fields, the cluster of craters seen along the left side of
the image. The Bay of Naples, on the left side of the image, is
separated from the Gulf of Salerno, in the lower left, by the Sorrento
Peninsula. Dense urban settlement can be seen around the
volcano. The city of Naples is above and to the left of Vesuvius; the
seaport of the city can be seen in the top of the bay. Pompeii
is located just below the volcano on this image. The rapid eruption in
79 A.D. buried the victims and buildings of Pompeii under
several meters of debris and killed more than 2,000 people. Due to the
violent eruptive style and proximity to populated areas,
Vesuvius has been named by the international scientific community as one
of fifteen Decade Volcanoes which are being
intensively studied during the 1990s. The image is centered at 40.83
degrees North latitude, 14.53 degrees East longitude. It
shows an area 100 kilometers by 55 kilometers (62 miles by 34 miles.)

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Long Island optical/radar</TITLE>
<H1>Long Island optical/radar
</H1>
<P>

This pair of images of the Long Island, New York region is a comparison
of an optical photograph (top) and a radar image (bottom), both taken in
darkness in April
1994. The photograph at the top was taken by the Endeavour astronauts at
about 3 a.m. Eastern time on April 20, 1994. The image at the bottom was
acquired at
about the same time four days earlier on April 16, 1994 by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
system aboard
the space shuttle Endeavour. Both images show an area approximately 100
kilometers by 40 kilometers (62 miles by 25 miles) that is centered at
40.7 degrees
North latitude and 73.5 degrees West longitude. North is toward the
upper right. The optical image is dominated by city lights, which are
particularly bright in the
densely developed urban areas of New York City located on the left half
of the photo. The brightest white zones appear on the island of
Manhattan in the left
center, and Central Park can be seen as a darker area in the middle of
Manhattan. To the northeast (right) of the city, suburban Long Island
appears as a less densely
illuminated area, with the brightest zones occurring along major
transportation and development corridors. Since radar is an active
sensing system that provides its
own illumination, the radar image shows a great amount of surface
detail, despite the night-time acquisition. The colors in the radar
image were obtained using the
following radar channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted and received); green represents the L-band (horizontally
transmitted and vertically
received); blue represents the C- band (horizontally transmitted and
vertically received). In this image, the water surface - the Atlantic
Ocean along the bottom
edge and Long Island Sound shown at the top edge - appears red because
small waves at the surface strongly reflect the horizontally transmitted
and received
L-band radar signal. Networks of highways and railroad lines are clearly
visible in the radar image; many of them can also be seen as bright
lines in the optical
image. The runways of John F. Kennedy International Airport appear as a
dark rectangle in Jamaica Bay on the left side of the image. Developed
areas appear
generally as bright green and orange, while agricultural, protected and
undeveloped areas appear darker blue or purple. This contrast can be
seen on the barrier
islands along the south coast of Long Island, which are heavily
developed in the Rockaway and Long Beach areas south and east of Jamaica
Bay, but further to the
east, the islands are protected and undeveloped.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Western Pacific</TITLE>
<H1>Western Pacific</H1>
<P>
This radar image shows the ocean surface in a portion of the Western
Pacific Ocean. Scientists are using images like this to study the
occurrence, distribution and activity of tropical rain squalls and to
understand the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean and
the upper layer mixing in the tropical oceans, which are critical
factors for understanding the driving forces which produce the El Nino
phenomenon. The white, curved area at the top of the image is a portion
of the Ontong Java Atoll, part of the Solomon Islands group. The
yellowish green area near the bottom of the image is an intense rain
cell. This image is centered near 5.5 degrees South latitude and 159.5
degrees East longitude. The area shown is 50 kilometers by 21 kilometers
(31 miles by 13 miles). This image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 13th orbit on
April 10, 1994. The colors in the image are assigned to different
frequencies and polarizations of the SIR-C radar as follows: Red is
C-band horizontally transmitted and received; green is L-band
horizontally transmitted and vertically received and blue is L-band
horizontally transmitted and received. The large rain cell is about 15
kilometers by 15 kilometers (9 miles by 9 miles) and contains two
dark regions, one circular and one rectangular, inside it. Two smaller
reddish cells are visible closer to the atoll. The red areas may be
caused by reflection from ice particles in the colder, upper portion of
the storm cell and not from the ocean surface at all. This provides
direct evidence that it is raining within this storm cell, valuable
information which is usually very difficult to measure over more remote
regions of the ocean away from coastal-based weather systems. The dark
holes in the middle of the cell are thought to be areas of very
heavy rainfall which actually smooth out the ocean surface and result in
lower radar returns . The surrounding ocean is blue to green plus
black. Winds and currents cause the ocean surface to be rough and those
variations on the surface affect how the radar signals bounce off
the surface. The bright areas on the image correspond to areas where the
wind speed is high. The highest winds are seen as the
yellow-green region of the large rain cell. The lowest winds are seen
inside the atoll as dark areas. Outside the rain cell, the winds are
moderately low, which is indicated by the puff-like, blue patterns
surrounding the cell and extending into the atoll. The long, thin, dark
lines extending across the ocean are surface currents. Here the currents
are likely accumulating natural oils caused by small marine
biological organisms. The oils cause the small, wind-generated waves to
be reduced in size or damped which produces a smooth, dark
zone on the radar image.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Colombian volcano</TITLE>
<H1>Colombian volcano</H1>
<P>
This is a radar image of a little known volcano in northern 
Colombia.  The image  was acquired on orbit 80 of space 
shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994, by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR).  The volcano near the center of the image is located 
at 5.6 degrees north latitude, 75.0 degrees west longitude, 
about 100 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of Medellin, 
Colombia. The conspicuous dark spot is a lake at the bottom 
of an approximately 3-kilometer-wide (1.9-mile) volcanic 
collapse depression or caldera. A cone-shaped peak on the 
bottom left (northeast rim) of the caldera appears to have 
been the source for a flow of material into the caldera. 
This is the northern-most known volcano in South America and 
because of its youthful appearance, should be considered 
dormant rather than extinct. The volcano's existence 
confirms a fracture zone proposed in 1985 as the northern 
boundary of volcanism in the Andes.  The SIR-C/X-SAR image 
reveals another, older caldera further south in Colombia, 
along another proposed fracture zone. Although relatively 
conspicuous, these volcanoes have escaped widespread 
recognition because of  frequent cloud cover that hinders 
remote sensing imaging in visible wavelengths.  Four 
separate volcanoes in the Northern Andes nations of Colombia 
and Ecuador have been active during the last 10 years, 
killing more than 25,000 people, including scientists who 
were monitoring the volcanic activity. Detection and 
monitoring of volcanoes from space provides a safe way to 
investigate volcanism. The recognition of previously unknown 
volcanoes is important for hazard evaluations because a 
number of major eruptions this century have occurred at 
mountains that were not previously recognized as volcanoes.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Death Valley, California</TITLE>
<H1>Death Valley, California</H1>

<P>
This image shows Death Valley, California, centered at 36.629
degrees north latitude, 117.069 degrees west longitude.  The
image shows Furnace Creek alluvial fan and Furnace Creek Ranch at
the far right, and the sand dunes near Stove Pipe Wells at the
center.  The dark fork-shaped feature between Furnace Creek fan
and the dunes is a smooth flood-plain which encloses Cottonball
Basin.  This SIR-C/X-SAR supersite is an area of extensive field
investigations and has been visited by both Space Radar Lab
astronaut crews.  Elevations in the valley range from 70 meters
(230 feet) below sea level, the lowest in the United States, to
more than 3,300 meters (10,800 feet) above sea level.  Scientists
are using SIR-C/X-SAR data from Death Valley to help answer a
number of different questions about Earth's geology.  One
question concerns how alluvial fans are formed and change through
time under the influence of climatic changes and earthquakes. 
Alluvial fans are gravel deposits that wash down from the
mountains over time.  They are visible in the image as circular,
fan-shaped bright areas extending into the darker valley floor
from the mountains.  Information about the alluvial fans helps
scientists study Earth's ancient climate.  Scientists know the
fans are built up through climatic and tectonic processes and
they will use the SIR-C/X-SAR data to understand the nature and
rates of weathering processes on the fans, soil formation and the
transport of sand and dust by the wind.  SIR-C/X-SAR's
sensitivity to centimeter-scale (inch-scale) roughness provides
detailed maps of surface texture.  Such information can be used
to study the occurrence and movement of dust storms and sand
dunes.  The goal of these studies is to gain a better
understanding of the record of past climatic changes and the
effects of those changes on a sensitive environment.  This may
lead to a better ability to predict future response of the land
to different potential global climate-change scenarios.
<P>
Death Valley is also one of the primary calibration sites for
SIR-C/X-SAR.  The bright dots near the center of the image are
corner reflectors that have been set-up to calibrate the radar as
the shuttle passes overhead.  Thirty triangular-shaped reflectors
(they look like aluminum pyramids) have been deployed by the
calibration team from JPL over a 40- by 40-kilometer (25- by 25-
mile) area in and around Death Valley.   The calibration team
will also deploy transponders (electronic reflectors) and
receivers to measure the radar signals from SIR- C/X-SAR on the
ground.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Flevoland, The Netherlands</TITLE>
<H1>Flevoland, The Netherlands</H1>
<P>
This is a three-frequency false color image of Flevoland, The
Netherlands, centered at 52.4 degrees north latitude, 5.4 degrees
east longitude.  This image was acquired by the Spaceborne
Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
aboard space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994.  It was
produced by combining data from the X-band, C-band and L-band
radars.  The area shown is approximately 25 kilometers by 28
kilometers (15-1/2 by 17-1/2 miles).  Flevoland, which fills the
lower two-thirds of the image, is a very flat area that is made
up of reclaimed land that is used for agriculture and forestry. 
At the top of the image, across the canal from Flevoland, is an
older forest shown in red; the city of Harderwijk is shown in
white on the shore of the canal.  At this time of the year, the
agricultural fields are bare soil, and they show up in this image
in blue.  The changes in the brightness of the blue areas are
equal to the changes in roughness.  The dark blue areas are water
and the small dots in the canal are boats.  This SIR-C/X-SAR
supersite is being used for both calibration and agricultural
studies.  Several soil and crop ground-truth studies will be
conducted during the shuttle flight.  In addition, about 10
calibration devices and 10 corner reflectors have been deployed
to calibrate and monitor the radar signal.  One of these
transponders can be seen as a bright star in the lower right
quadrant of the image.  This false-color image was made using L-
band total power in the red channel, C-band total power in the
green channel, and X-band VV polarization in the blue channel.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Galapagos Islands</TITLE>
<H1>Galapagos Islands</H1>
<P>
This is an image showing part of Isla Isabela in the
western Galapagos Islands.  It was taken by the L-band radar in
HH polarization from the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar on the 40th orbit of the space shuttle 
Endeavour.  The image is centered at about 0.5 degree south 
latitude and 91 degrees west longitude and covers an area of 75
by 60 kilometers (47 by 37 miles).  The radar incidence angle at
the center of the image is about 20 degrees.
<P>
The western Galapagos Islands, which lie about 1,200 kilometers
(750 miles) west of Ecuador in the eastern Pacific, have six
active volcanoes similar to the volcanoes found in Hawaii.  Since
the time of Charles Darwin's visit to the area in 1835, there
have been over 60 recorded eruptions on these volcanoes.  This
SIR-C/X-SAR image of Alcedo and Sierra Negra volcanoes shows the 
rougher lava flows as bright features, while ash deposits and 
smooth pahoehoe lava flows appear dark.  A small portion of Isla
Fernandina is visible in the extreme upper left corner  of the
image.
<P>
The Galapagos Islands are one of the SIR-C/X-SAR supersites and
data of this area will be taken several times during the flight
to allow scientists to conduct topographic change studies and to
search for different lava flow types, ash deposits and fault
lines.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Galeras Volcano</TITLE>
<H1>Galeras Volcano</H1>
<P>
This radar image of the area surrounding the Galeras volcano in 
southern Colombia shows the ability of a multi-frequency radar to 
map volcanic structures that can be dangerous to study on the 
ground.  Galeras has erupted more than 20 times since the area 
was first visited by European explorers in the 1500s.  Volcanic 
activity levels have been high in the last five years, including 
an eruption in January 1993 that killed nine people on a 
scientific expedition to the volcano summit.  Galeras is the 
light green area near the center of the image.  The active cone, 
with a small summit pit, is the red feature nestled against the 
lower right edge of the caldera (crater) wall.  The city of 
Pasto, with a population of 300,000, is shown in orange near the 
bottom of the image, just 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the 
volcano.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/ X-SAR) aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on its 96th orbit on April 15, 1994.  
North is toward the upper right. The area shown is 49.1 by 36.0 
kilometers (30.5 by 22.3 miles), centered at 1.2 degrees north 
latitude and 77.4 degrees west longitude.  The radar illumination 
is from the top of the image.  The false colors in this image 
were created using the following radar channels:  red represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted, vertically 
received); blue represents the C-band (horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received).  Galeras is one of 15 volcanoes worldwide 
that are being monitored by the scientific community as an 
"International Decade Volcano" because of the hazard that it 
represents to the local population.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Gorilla habitat, Central Africa</TITLE>
<H1>Gorilla habitat, Central Africa</H1>
<P>
This is a false-color radar image of Central Africa, showing 
the Virunga Volcano chain along the borders of Rwanda, Zaire 
and Uganda.  This area is home to the endangered 
mountain gorillas.  This C- and L-band image was acquired on 
April 12, 1994, on orbit 58 of space shuttle Endeavour by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR).  The area is centered at about 1.75 
degrees south latitude and 29.5 degrees east longitude.  The 
image covers an area 58 kilometers by 178 kilometers (48 
miles by 178 miles).   The false-color composite is created 
by displaying the L-band HH return in red, the L-band HV 
return in green and the C-band HH return in blue.  The dark 
area in the bottom of the image is Lake Kivu, which forms 
the border between Zaire (to the left) and Rwanda (to the 
right).  The airport at Goma, Zaire is shown as a dark line 
just above the lake in the bottom left corner of the image.  
Volcanic flows from the 1977 eruption of Mt. Nyiragongo are 
shown just north of the airport.  Mt. Nyiragongo is not 
visible in this image because it is located just to the left 
of the image swath.  Very fluid lava flows from the 1977 
eruption killed 70 people.  Mt. Nyiragongo is currently 
erupting (August 1994) and will be a target of observation 
during the second flight of SIR-C/X-SAR.  The large volcano 
in the center of the image is Mt. Karisimbi (4,500 meters or 
14,800 feet).  This radar image highlights subtle 
differences in the vegetation and volcanic flows of the 
region.  The faint lines shown in the purple regions are 
believed to be the result of agriculture terracing by the 
people who live in the region.  The vegetation types are an 
important factor in the habitat of the endangered mountain 
gorillas.  Researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey 
and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund in London will use this 
data to produce vegetation maps of the area to aid in their 
study of the remaining 650 gorillas in the region.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Kilauea, Hawaii</TITLE>
<H1>Kilauea, Hawaii</H1>
<P>
This color composite C-band and L-band image of the Kilauea
volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperature Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) flying on space shuttle Endeavour.  The city of Hilo can
be seen at the top.  The image shows the different types of lava
flows around the crater Pu'u O'o.  Ash deposits which erupted in
1790 from the summit of Kilauea volcano show up as dark in this
image, and fine details associated with lava flows which erupted
in 1919 and 1974 can be seen to the south of the summit in an
area called the Ka'u Desert.  In addition, the other historic
lava flows created in 1881 and 1984 from Mauna Loa volcano (out
of view to the left of this image) can be easily seen despite the
fact that the surrounding area is covered by forest.  Such
information will be used to map the extent of such flows, which
can pose a hazard to the subdivisions of Hilo.  Highway 11 is the
linear feature running from Hilo to the Kilauea volcano.  The
Kilauea volcano has been almost continuously active for more than
the last 11 years.  Field teams that were on the ground
specifically to support these radar observations report that
there was vigorous surface activity about 400 meters (one-quarter
mile) inland from the coast.  A moving lava flow about 200 meters
(660 feet) in length was observed at the time of the shuttle
overflight, raising the possibility that subsequent images taken
during this mission will show changes in the landscape.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mammoth, California</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth, California</H1>
<P>
This image is a false-color composite of the Mammoth Mountain
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California.  The image is
centered at 37.6 degrees north latitude and 119.0 degrees west
longitude. The area is approximately 11.5 kilometers by 78.3
kilometers (7.2 by 48.7 miles) in size.  The image was acquired
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard space shuttle Endeavour on its 40th orbit,
April 11, 1994.  The city of Mammoth Lakes is visible in the
bottom right portion of the scene.  In this color representation,
red is C-band HV-polarization, green is C-band VV-polarization
and blue is the ratio of C-band VV to C-band HV.  Blue areas are
lakes or slopes facing away from the radar illumination.  Yellow
represents areas of dry, old snow as well as slopes facing
directly the radar illumination.   
<P>
At the time of the SIR-C overflight, the sky conditions were
partially cloudy, with low and cold air temperatures. Total snow
depth is about 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet).  The current snow
accumulation is only about 40 percent of the average for the
season.  The most recent snowfall in the area covered the entire
area with about 30 centimeters (14 inches) of fresh dry snow. 
Above 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) elevation the snowpack is dry.
Below that elevation, the snowpack has a layered structure.  
Snow hydrologists are using SIR-C/X-SAR data to determine both
the quantity of water held by seasonal snowpack and the amount of
snow melting.

kilometers by 40 kilometers (5 by 25 miles).  At the top of the
image are the Solimoes and Rio Negro rivers just before they
combine at Manaus to form the Amazon River.  The image is
centered at about 3 degrees south latitude, and 61 degrees west
longitude.  The false colors are created by displaying three L-
band polarization channels; red areas correspond to high
backscatter at HH polarization, while green areas exhibit high
backscatter at HV polarization.  Blue areas show low returns at
VV polarization; hence the bright blue colors of the smooth river
surfaces.  Using this coloring scheme, green areas in the image 
are heavily forested, while blue areas are either cleared forest
or open water.  The yellow and red areas are flooded forest.
Between Rio Solimoes and Rio Negro a road can be seen running
from some cleared areas (visible as blue rectangles north of Rio
Solimoes) north towards a tributary of Rio Negro.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Namibia, Africa</TITLE>
<P> 
<h1>Namibia, Africa</h1>
<p>
This is a C-band, VV polarization radar image of the Namib 
desert in southern Namibia, near the coast of South West 
Africa.  The image is centered at about 25 degrees South 
latitude, 15.5 degrees East longitude.  This image was one 
of the first acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-
Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) when it was 
taken on orbit 4 from the shuttle Endeavour on April 9, 
1994.  The area shown is approximately 78 kilometers by 20 
kilometers.   The dominant features in the image are complex 
sand dune patterns formed by the prevailing winds in this 
part of the Namib desert.  The Namib desert is an extremely 
dry area formed largely because of the influence of the cold 
Benguela ocean current that flows northward along the coast 
of Namibia.  The bright areas at the bottom of the image are 
exposed outcrops of Precambrian rocks.  This extremely 
barren area is a region rich in diamonds that through the 
centuries have washed down from the mountains.  The town of 
Luderitz is located just to the south of the area shown.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany</TITLE>
<H1>Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany</H1>
<P>
This is a false-color, three-frequency image of the
Oberpfaffenhofen supersite, southwest of Munich in southern
Germany, which shows the differences in what the three radar
bands can see on the ground.  The image covers a 27- by 36-
kilometer (17- by 22-mile) area. The center of the site is 48.09
degrees north and 11.29 degrees east.  The image was acquired by
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle Endeavour on April 13, 1994,
just after a heavy storm which covered the all area with 20
centimeters (8 inches) of snow.  The dark area in the center of
the image is Lake Ammersee.  The two smaller lakes above the
Ammersee are the Worthsee and the Pilsensee.  On the right of the
image is the tip of the Starnbergersee. The outskirt of the city
of Munich can be seen at the top of the image.  The
Oberpfaffenhofen supersite is the major test site for X-SAR
calibration and scientific experiments such as ecology, hydrology
and geology.  This color composite image is a three-frequency
overlay.  L-band total power was assigned red, the C-band total
power is shown in green and the X-band VV polarization appears
blue.  The colors on the image stress the differences between the
L-band, C-band and X-band images.  If the three frequencies were
seeing the same thing, the image will appear in black and white.
For example, the blue areas corresponds to area for which the X-
band backscatter is relatively higher than the backscatter at L-
and C-band; this behavior is characteristic of clear cuts or
shorter vegetation.  Similarly, the forested areas have a reddish
tint.  Finally, the green areas seen at the southern tip of both
the Ammersee and the Pilsensee lakes indicate a marshy area.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Oetztal, Austria</TITLE>
<H1>Oetztal, Austria</H1>
<P>
This image is a false-color composite of Oetztal, Austria located
in the Central Alps centered at 46.8 degrees north latitude,
10.70 degrees east longitude, at the border between
Switzerland, Italy and Austria.  The area
shown is 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Innsbruck, Austria.
This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and
X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space
shuttle Endeavour on its 14th orbit.  Oetztal is a SIR-C/X-SAR
hydrology supersite.  Approximately one quarter of this image is
covered by glaciers, the largest of which, Gepatschferner, is
visible as a triangular yellow patch in the center of the scene.
The summits of the main peaks reach elevations between 3,500 and
3,768 meters (11,500 and 12,362 feet) above sea level.  The
tongues of the glaciers are descending from elevated plateaus
down into narrow valleys which were formed during the last ice
age.  This color image was produced in C-band using
multi-polarization information (red=CHV, green=CVV,
blue=CVV/CHV).  The blue areas are lakes (Gepatsch dam at center
right; Lake Muta at top right) and glacier ice.  The yellow areas 
are slopes facing the radar and areas of dry snow.  Purple
corresponds to slopes facing away from the radar.  Yellow in the
valley bottom corresponds to tree covered areas.  There is 30 to
50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) of dry, fresh snow on the
glaciers, and about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the valley at
the city of Vent, Austria (center).  At these data were taken,
the weather was cold, with snow and thick fog.  The entire area
would appear white to an optical sensor because it is all covered
under a winter snowpack.  Researchers are interested in Oetztal
because knowing how glaciers shrink and grow over time is an
important indication of climatic change.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Prince Albert, Canada</TITLE>
<H1>Prince Albert, Canada</H1>
<P>
This is a false-color composite of Prince Albert, Canada,
centered at 53.91 north latitude and 104.69 west longitude.  This
image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard space shuttle
Endeavour on its 20th orbit.  The area is located 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north and 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of the town of
Prince Albert in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.  The image
covers the area east of the Candle lake, between gravel surface
highways 120 and 106 and west of 106.  The area in the middle of
the image covers the entire Nipawin (Narrow Hills) provincial
park.  The look angle of the radar is 30 degrees and the size of
the image is approximately 20 kilometers by 50 kilometers (12 by
30 miles).  The image was produced by using only the L-band.  The
three polarization channels HH, HV and VV are illustrated by red,
green and blue respectively.  The changes in the intensity of
each color are related to various surface conditions such as
variations in forest stands, frozen or thawed condition of the
surface, disturbances (fire and deforestation), and areas of
regrowth.  Most of the dark areas in the image are the ice-
covered lakes in the region.  The dark area on the top right
corner of the image is the white Gull Lake north of the
intersection of highway 120 and 913.  The right middle part of
the image shows Lake Ispuchaw and Lower Fishing Lake.  The
deforested areas are also shown by dark areas in the image. 
Since most of the logging practice at the Prince Albert area is
around the major highways, the deforested areas can be easily
detected as small geometrically shaped dark regions along the
roads.
<P>
At the time of the SIR-C/X-SAR overpass a major part of the
forest is either frozen or undergoing the spring thaw.  The L-
band HH shows a high return in the jack pine forest.  The reddish
areas in the image are old jack pine forest, 12 to 17 meters (40
to 55 feet) in height and 60 to 75 years old.  The orange-
greenish areas are young jack pine trees, 3 to 5 meters (10 to 16
feet) in height and 11 to 16 years old.  The green areas are due
To the relative high intensity of the HV channel which is
strongly correlated with the amount of biomass.  L-band HV
channel shows the biomass variations over the entire region.  
Most of the green areas, when compared to the forest cover maps
are identified as black spruce trees.   The dark blue and dark
purple colors show recently harvested or regrowth areas
respectively.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mt Pinatubo, Philippines</TITLE>
<H1>Mt Pinatubo, Philippines</H1>
<P>
This is a false color L-band and C-band image of the area around 
Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, centered at about 15 degrees 
north latitude, 120.5 degrees east longitude.  This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour
on orbit 78 on April 13, 1994.  The false-color composite is made
by displaying the L-band HH return in red, the L-band HV return
in green and the C-band HV return in blue.  The area shown is 
approximately 45 by 68 kilometers (28 by 42 miles).  The main
volcanic crater on Mount Pinatubo produced by the June 1991
eruptions, and the steep slopes on the upper flanks of the
volcano, are easily seen in this image.  The red color on the
high slopes show the rougher ash deposited during the 1991
eruption.  The dark drainages are the smooth mudflows which
continue to flood the river valleys after heavy rain.  Radar
images such as this one can be used to identify the areas flooded
by mudflows, which are difficult to distinguish visually, and to
assess the rate at which the erosion and deposition continues.  A
key aspect of the second SIR-C/X-SAR mission in August 1994 will
be to collect a second image of Pinatubo during the summer
monsoon season -- new mudflows will have occurred -- and to
evaluate the short-term changes.  The 1991 eruption of Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines is well known for its near-global
effects on the atmosphere and climate due to the large amount of
sulfur dioxide that was injected into the upper atmosphere.  What
is less widely known is that even today the volcano continues to
be a major hazard to the people who have returned to the area
around the volcano.  Dangerous mudflows (called "lahars") are
often generated by heavy rains, and these can still sweep down
river valleys and wash out roads and villages, or bury low lying
areas in several meters of mud and volcanic debris.  These
mudflows will continue to be a severe hazard around Pinatubo for
the next 10 to 15 years.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Raco, Michigan</TITLE>
<H1>Raco, Michigan</H1>
<P>
This image is a false-color composite of Raco, Michigan, centered
at 46.39 degrees north latitude, 84.88 degrees west longitude.
This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-
Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space
shuttle Endeavour on its sixth orbit and during the first full-
capability test of the instrument on April 9, 1994.  This image
was produced using both L-band and C-band data.  The area shown
is approximately 20 kilometers by 50 kilometers (12 by 30 miles). 
Raco is located at the eastern end of Michigan's upper peninsula,
west of Sault Ste. Marie and south of Whitefish Bay on Lake
Superior.  The site is located at the boundary between the boreal
forests and the northern temperate forests, a transitional zone
that is expected to be ecologically sensitive to anticipated
global changes resulting from climatic warming.  On any given
day, there is a 60 percent chance that this area will be obscured
to some extent by cloud clover which makes it difficult to image
using optical sensors.  In this color representation (red=LHH,
green=LHV, blue=CHH), darker areas in the image are smooth
surfaces such as frozen lakes and other non-forested areas.  The
colors are related to the types of trees and the brightness is
related to the amount of plant material covering the surface,
called forest biomass.  The black area in the upper right corner
is the ice-covered Lake Superior.  The blue mosaic areas in the
lower part of the image are bare agricultural fields with hay
stubble.  The large blue area to the center left of the image
corresponds to a large frozen swamp with no trees and lots of
grass trufts.  The light greenish-yellow areas are red pine trees
approximately 30 meters (100 feet) in height.  The brownish
yellow areas are jack pine trees of various ages.  The dark
patches are areas of recent clear cuts in the managed Hiawatha
National Forest.  The shore line of Lake Superior in the light
greenish blue is a mixture of aspen and birch trees.  South of
that, surrounding McNearny and Johnson lakes is a dark purple
area containing north hardwoods.  Accurate information about
land-cover is important to area resource managers and for use in
regional- to global-scale scientific models used understand
global change.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Roter Kamm crater, Namibia</TITLE>
<H1>Roter Kamm crater, Namibia</H1>
<P>
This space radar image shows the Roter Kamm impact crater in 
southwest Namibia.  The crater rim is seen in the lower 
center of the image as a radar-bright, circular feature.  
Geologists believe the crater was formed by a meteorite that 
collided with Earth approximately 5 million years ago.  The 
data were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) instrument onboard 
space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994.  The area is 
located at 27.8 degrees south latitude and 16.2 degrees east 
longitude in southern Africa.  The colors in this image were 
obtained using the following radar channels:  red represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); and blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  The 
area shown is approximately 25.5 kilometers (15.8 miles) by 
36.4 kilometers (22.5 miles), with north toward the lower 
right.  The bright white irregular feature in the lower left 
corner is a small hill of exposed rock outcrop.  Roter Kamm 
is a moderate sized impact crater, 2.5 kilometers (1.5 
miles) in diameter rim to rim, and is 130 meters (400 feet) 
deep.  However, its original floor is covered by sand 
deposits at least 100 meters (300 feet) thick.  In a 
conventional aerial photograph, the brightly colored 
surfaces immediately surrounding the crater cannot be seen 
because they are covered by sand.  The faint blue surfaces 
adjacent to the rim may indicate the presence of a layer of 
rocks ejected from the crater during the impact.  The 
darkest areas are thick windblown sand deposits which form 
dunes and sand sheets.  The sand surface is smooth relative 
to the surrounding granite and limestone rock outcrops and 
appears dark in radar image.  The green tones are related 
primarily to larger vegetation growing on sand soil, and the 
reddish tones are associated with thinly mantled limestone 
outcrops.  Studies of impact craters on the surface of the 
Earth help geologists understand the role of the impact 
process in the Earth's evolution, including effects on the 
atmosphere and on biological evolution.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Safsaf, North Africa</TITLE>
<H1>Safsaf, North Africa</H1>
<P>
This is a false-color image of the uninhabited Safsaf Oasis in
southern Egypt near the Egypt/Sudan border.  It was produced from
data obtained from the L-band and C-band radars that are part of
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle Endeavour on April 9, 1994. 
The image is centered at 22 degree north latitude, 29 degrees
east longitude.  It shows detailed structures of bedrock; the
dark blue sinuous lines are braided channels that occupy part of
an old broad river valley.  On the ground and in optical
photographs, this big valley and the channels in it are invisible
because they are entirely covered by windblown sand.  Some of
these same channels were observed in SIR-A images in 1981.  It is
hypothesized that the large valley was carved by one of several
ancient predecessor rivers that crossed this part of North
Africa, flowing westward, tens of millions of years before the
Nile River existed.  The Nile flows north about 300 kilometers
(200 miles) to the east.  The small channels are younger, and
probably formed during relatively wet climatic periods within the
past few hundred thousand years.  This image shows that the
channels are in a river valley located in an area where U.S.
Geological Survey geologists and archeologists discovered an
unsual concentration of handaxes (stone tools) used by Early Man
(Homo erectus) hundreds of thousands of years ago.  The image
clearly shows that in wetter times, the valley would have
supported game animals and vegetation.  Today, as a result of
climate change,the area in uninhabited and lacks water except for
a few scattered oases.  This color composite image was produced
from C-band and L-band horizontal polarization images.  The C-
band image was assigned red, the L-band (HH) polarization image
is shown in green, and the ratio of these two images (LHH/CHH)
appears in blue.  The primary and composite colors on the image
indicate the degree to which the C-band, H-band, their ratio --
or some combination of all three -- respond to the roughness of
the radar backscattering surface.  Using this coloring scheme,
areas that appear bright at both L-band and C-band are colored
yellow, while areas that appear brighter at L-band than C-band
appear more blue.  Detailed analysis of this scene indicates that
the separate C-band and L-band images used to produce this color
composite have a very similar overall appearance.  This suggests
that the C- band and the L-band signals are both easily
penetrating the thin 1- to 12-centimeter (0.5- to 5-inch)
"average" surface cover of loose windblown sand, and are commonly
"seeing" similar interfaces just below that cover.  This radar
interface may be at the scattered rocky outcrops on the ground
surface, but is more likely to be the shallow underlying surfaces
of river gravel or bedrock, which are generally covered by only a
few inches of windblown sand.  Virtually everything visible on

<TITLE>SRL-1 - China's Silk Road</TITLE>
<H1>China's Silk Road</H1> 
<P> 
This composite image is of an area thought to contain the 
ruins of the ancient settlement of Niya.  It is located in 
the southwest corner of the Taklamakan Desert in China's 
Sinjiang Province.  This region was part of some of China's 
earliest dynasties and from the third century BC on was 
traversed by the famous Silk Road.  The Silk Road, passing 
east-west through this image, was an ancient trade route 
that led across Central Asia's desert to Persia, Byzantium 
and Rome.  The multi-frequency, multi-polarized radar 
imagery was acquired on orbit 106 of the space shuttle 
Endeavour on April 16, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-
C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar. The image is centered at 
37.78 degrees north latitude and 82.41 degrees east 
longitude.  The area shown is approximately 35 kilometers by 
83 kilometers (22 miles by 51 miles).  The image is a 
composite of an image from an Earth-orbiting satellite 
called Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 
and a SIR-C multi-frequency, multi-polarized radar image. 
The false-color radar image was created by displaying the C-
band (horizontally transmitted and received) return in red, 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received) return in 
green, and the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received) return in blue.  The prominent 
east/west pink formation at the bottom of the image is most 
likely a ridge of loosely consolidated sedimentary rock.  
The Niya River -- the black feature in the lower right of 
the French satellite image -- meanders north-northeast until 
it clears the sedimentary ridge, at which point it abruptly 
turns northwest.  Sediment and evaporite deposits left by 
the river over millennia dominate the center and upper right 
of the radar image (in light pink).  High ground, ridges and 
dunes are seen among the riverbed meanderings as mottled 
blue.  Through image enhancement and analysis, a new feature 
probably representing a man-made canal has been discovered 
and mapped.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Lost city of Ubar</TITLE>
<H1>Lost city of Ubar</H1>
<P>
This is a radar image of the region around the site of the 
lost city of Ubar in southern Oman, on the Arabian 
Peninsula.   The ancient city was discovered in 1992 with 
the aid of remote sensing data.  Archeologists believe Ubar 
existed from about 2800 B.C. to about 300 A.D. and was a 
remote desert outpost where caravans were assembled for the 
transport of frankincense across the desert.  This image was 
acquired on orbit 65 of space shuttle Endeavour on April 13, 
1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR).  The SIR-C image shown is 
centered at 18.4 degrees north latitude and 53.6 degrees 
east longitude.  The image covers an area about 50 by 100 
kilometers (31 miles by 62 miles). The image is constructed 
from three of the available SIR-C channels and displays L-
band, HH (horizontal transmit and receive) data as red, C-
band HH as blue, and L-band HV (horizontal transmit, 
vertical receive) as green. The prominent magenta colored 
area is a region of large sand dunes, which are bright 
reflectors at both L- and C-band.  The prominent green areas 
(L-HV) are rough limestone rocks, which form a rocky desert 
floor.  A major wadi, or dry stream bed, runs across the 
middle of the image and is shown largely in white due to 
strong radar scattering in all channels displayed (L and C 
HH, L-HV).  The actual site of the fortress of the lost city 
of Ubar, currently under excavation, is near the Wadi close 
to the center of the image. The fortress is too small to be 
detected in this image.  However, tracks leading to the 
site, and surrounding tracks, appear as prominent, but 
diffuse, reddish streaks.  These tracks have been used in 
modern times, but field investigations show many of these 
tracks were in use in ancient times as well.  Mapping of 
these tracks on regional remote sensing images was a key to 
recognizing the site as Ubar in 1992.  This image, and 
ongoing field investigations, will help shed light on a 
little known early civilization.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Unzen volcano, Japan</TITLE>
<H1>Unzen volcano, Japan</H1>
<P>
This is a space radar image of the area around the Unzen 
volcano, on the west coast of Kyushu Island in southwestern 
Japan.  Unzen, which appears in this image as a large 
triangular peak with a white flank near the center of the 
peninsula, has been continuously active since a series of 
powerful eruptions began in 1991.  The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 93rd orbit on April 15, 1994.  The image shows an area 
41.5 kilometers by 32.8 kilometers (25.7 miles by 20.3 
miles) that is centered at 32.75 degrees north latitude and 
130.15 degrees east longitude.  North is toward the upper 
left of the image.  The radar illumination is from the top 
of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained using 
the following radar channels:  red represents the L-band 
(vertically transmitted and received); green represents the 
average of L-band and C-band (vertically transmitted and 
received); blue represents the C-band (vertically 
transmitted and received). Unzen is one of 15 "Decade" 
volcanoes identified by the scientific community as posing 
significant potential threats to large local populations.  
The city of Shimabara sits along the coast at the foot of 
Unzen on its east and northeast sides.  At the summit of 
Unzen a dome of thick lava has been growing continuously 
since 1991.  Collapses of the sides of this dome have 
generated deadly avalanches of hot gas and rock known as 
pyroclastic flows.  Volcanologists can use radar image data 
to monitor the growth of lava domes, to better understand 
and predict potentially hazardous collapses.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Yucatan impact crater site</TITLE>
<H1>Yucatan impact crater site</H1>
<P>
This is a radar image of the southwest portion of  the 
buried Chicxulub impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, 
Mexico.  The radar image was acquired on orbit 81 of space 
shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR).  The image is centered at 20 degrees north latitude 
and 90 degrees west longitude.  Scientists believe the 
crater was formed by an asteroid or comet which slammed into 
the Earth more than 65 million years ago.   It is this 
impact crater that has been linked to a major biological 
catastrophe where more than  50 percent of the Earth's 
species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct.  The 180- 
to 300-kilometer-diameter (110- to 180-mile) crater is 
buried by 300 to 1,000 meters (1,000 to 3,000 feet) of 
limestone.  The exact size of the crater is currently being 
debated by scientists.  This is a total power radar image 
with L-band in red, C-band in green, and the difference 
between C- and L-band in blue.  The 10-kilometer-wide (6-
mile) band of yellow and pink with blue patches along the 
top left  (northwestern side) of the image is a mangrove 
swamp.  The blue patches are islands of tropical forests 
created by freshwater springs that emerge through fractures 
in the limestone bedrock and are most abundant in the 
vicinity of the buried crater rim.  The fracture patterns 
and wetland hydrology in this region are controlled by the 
structure of the buried crater.  Scientists are using the 
SIR-C/X-SAR imagery to study wetland ecology and help 
determine the exact size of the impact crater.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia</H1>
<P>
This image from the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) was
obtained on the first day of the Space Radar Laboratory-1 (SRL-1)
mission, and shows the central part of the Kamchatka Peninsula in
Eastern Russia.  The prominent mountain to the right side of the
image is the 1,486-meter-high (4,875-foot) Karymsky volcano
located at 54.07 degrees north latitude, 159.60 degress east
longitude.  This volcano last erupted over an extended period of
time that started in 1970 and continued until late 1982.  During
this decade of activity, there were several quite large explosive
eruptions that produced pyroclastic flows, mud flows and lava
flows.  Other, more heavily eroded volcanoes can also be seen.
The Kamchatka Peninsula has many active volcanoes, including the
2,800-meter-high (9,186-foot) Bezimianny which erupted late last
year.  Other spectacular eruptions also took place from Plosky 
Tolbachik, which was the site of a major fissure eruption in
1976.  These volcanoes are particularly important to scientists
from the perspective of the environmental focus of the Mission to
Planet Earth as well as because of their role as natural hazards.
Because they are so high, and are located at a high latitude, 
the summits of some of these volcanoes actually extend into the
stratosphere -- a part of the atmosphere where volcanic aerosols
and ash can remain suspended for weeks or months, thus affecting
regional weather patterns and short-term climate.  In addition,
many of the 65 active volcanoes in this area erupt explosively,
producing ash plumes from Kamchatka that drift into the airways 
used by aircraft traveling from Alaska to Japan.  Monitoring
these volcanoes with orbital radar and other satellites is an
effective way to observe these natural hazards.  This image was
obtained on orbit 10 of the SRL-1 mission (data take 10.1) at an
incidence angle of 38.63 degrees.  The width of the image is 24
kilometers (15 miles).

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mammoth land cover map</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth land cover map</H1>
<P>
These two images were created using data from the Spaceborne
Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR). 
The image on the left is a false-color composite of the Mammoth
Mountain area in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains centered at
37.6 degrees north, 119.0 degrees west.  It was acquired onboard
space shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit on April 13, 1994.  In
the image on the left, red is C-band HV-polarization, green is C-
band HH-polarization and blue is the ratio of C-band VV-
polarization to C-band HV-polarization.  On the right is a
classification map of the surface features which was developed by
SIR-C/X-SAR science team members at the University of California,
Santa Barbara.  The area is about 23 by 46 kilometers (14 by 29
miles).  In the classification image, the colors represent the
following surfaces:
<P>
snow 
<P>
frozen lake, covered by snow
<P>
bare ground 
<P>
lake (open water)
<P>
short vegetation (mainly brush) 
<P>
sparse forest 
<P>
dense forest
<P>
Maps like this one are helpful to scientists studying snow
wettness and snow water equivelent in the snow pack.  Across the
globe, over major portions of the middle and high latitudes, and
at high elevations in the tropical latitudes, snow and alpine
glaciers are the largest contributors to run-off in rivers and to
ground-water recharge.  Snow hydrologists are using radar in an
attempt to estimate both the quantity of water held by seasonal
snow packs and the timing of snow melt.  Snow and ice also play
important roles in regional climates; understanding the processes
in seasonal snow cover is also important for studies of the
chemical balance of alpine drainage basins.  SIR-C/X-SAR is a
powerful tool because it is sensitive to most snow pack
conditions and is less influenced by weather conditions than
other remote sensing instruments, such as the Landsat satellite.

<H1>Manaus inundation map</H1>
<P>
These two images were created using data from the Spaceborne
Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR). 
On the left is a false-color image of Manaus, Brazil acquired
April 12, 1994, onboard space shuttle Endeavour.  In the center
of this image is the Solimoes River just west of Manaus before it
combines with the Rio Negro to form the Amazon River.  The scene
is around 8 by 8 kilometers (5 by 5 miles) with north toward the
top.  The radar image was produced in L-band where red areas
correspond to high backscatter at HH polarization, while green
areas exhibit high backscatter at HV polarization.  Blue areas
show low backscatter at VV polarization.  The image on the right
is a classification map showing the extent of flooding beneath
the forest canopy.  The classification map was developed by SIR-
C/X-SAR science team members at the University of California,
Santa Barbara.  The map uses the L-HH, L-HV, and L-VV images to
classify the radar image into six categories:
<P>
flooded forest
<P>
unflooded tropical rain forest 
<P>
open water, Amazon river
<P>
unflooded fields, some floating grasses
<P>
flooded shrubs 
<P>
floating and flooded grasses
<P>
Data like these help scientists evaluate flood damage on a global
scale.  Floods are highly episodic and much of the area inundated
is often tree-covered.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Raco biomass map</TITLE>
<H1>Raco biomass map</H1>
<P>
This biomass map of the Raco, Michigan, area was produced from
data acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle Endeavour. 
Biomass is the amount of plant material on an area of Earth's
surface.  Radar can directly sense the quantity and
organizational structure of the woody biomass in the forest. 
Science team members at the University of Michigan used the radar
data to estimate the standing biomass for this Raco site in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Detailed surveys of 70 forest
stands will be used to assess the accuracy of these techniques. 
The seasonal growth of terrestrial plants, and forests in
particular, leads to the temporary storage of large amounts of
carbon, which could directly affect changes in global climate.  
In order to accurately predict future global change, scientists
need detailed information about current distribution of
vegetation types and the amount of biomass present around the
globe.  Optical techniques to determine net biomass are
frustrated by chronic cloud-cover.  Imaging radar can penetrate
through cloud-cover with negligible signal losses.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Raco vegetation map</TITLE>
<H1>Raco vegetation map</H1>
<P>
This is a vegetation map of the Raco, Michigan area produced from
data acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle Endeavour.
The radar image, taken on April 9, 1994,  has been used by
science team members at the University of Michigan to produce
detailed map of land cover.    The imaged area is approximately
24 by 32 kilometers (15 by 20 miles).  The Raco airport, which is
a decommissioned military base, is easily identified by its
triangular runway structure.  An edge of Lake Superior,
approximately 44 kilometers (27 miles) west of Sault Sainte
Marie, appears in the top right of the image..  In this land
cover map each 30- by 30-meter (98- by 98-foot) spot is
identified as either a water surface, bare ground, short
vegetation, deciduous forest, lowland conifers or upland
conifers.  Different types of ground cover have different effects
on Earth's chemical, water and energy cycles.  By cataloguing
ground cover in an area, scientists expect to better understand
the processes of these cycles in a specific area.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Death Valley, California 3-D</TITLE>
<H1>Death Valley, California 3-D</H1>
<P>
This picture is a three-dimensional perspective view of Death
Valley, California.  This view was constructed by overlaying a
SIR-C radar image on a U.S. Geological Survey digital elevation
map.  The SIR-C image is centered at 36.629 degrees north
latitude and 117.069 degrees west longitude.  We are looking at
Stove Pipe Wells, which is the bright rectangle located in the
center of the picture frame.  Our vantage point is located atop a
large alluvial fan centered at the mouth of Cottonwood Canyon. 
In the foreground on the left, we can see the sand dunes near
Stove Pipe Wells.  In the background on the left, the Valley
floor gradually falls in elevation toward Badwater, the lowest
spot in the United States.  In the background on the right we can
see Tucki Mountain.  This SIR-C/X-SAR supersite is an area of
extensive field investigations and has been visited by both Space
Radar Lab astronaut crews. Elevations in the Valley range from 70
meters (230 feet) below sea level, the lowest in the United
States, to more than 3,300 meters (10,800 feet) above sea level.
Scientists are using SIR-C/X-SAR data from Death Valley to help
the answer a number of different questions about Earth's geology. 
One question concerns how alluvial fans are formed and change
through time under the influence of climatic changes and
earthquakes.  Alluvial fans are gravel deposits that wash down
from the mountains over time.  They are visible in the image as
circular, fan-shaped bright areas extending into the darker
valley floor from the mountains.  Information about the alluvial
fans helps scientists study Earth's ancient climate.  Scientists
know the fans are built up through climatic and tectonic
processes and they will use the SIR-C/X-SAR data to understand
the nature and rates of weathering processes on the fans, soil
formation and the transport of sand and dust by the wind.  SIR-
C/X-SAR's sensitivity to centimeter-scale (inch-scale) roughness
provides detailed maps of surface texture.  Such information can
be used to study the occurrence and movement of dust storms and
sand dunes.  The goal of these studies is to gain a better
understanding of the record of past climatic changes and the
effects of those changes on a sensitive environment.  This may
lead to a better ability to predict future response of the land
to different potential global climate-change scenarios.  Vertical
exaggeration is 1.87 times; exaggeration of relief is a common
tool scientists use to detect relationships between structure
(for example, faults and fractures) and topography.
<P>
Death Valley is also one of the primary calibration sites for
SIR-C/X-SAR.  In the lower right quadrant of the picture frame
two bright dots can be seen which form a line extending to Stove
Pipe Wells.  These dots are corner reflectors that have been set
up to calibrate the radar as the shuttle passes overhead.  Thirty
triangular-shaped reflectors (they look like aluminum pyramids)
have been deployed by the calibration team from JPL over a 40- by
40-kilometer (25- by 25-mile) area in and around Death Valley.  
The signatures of these reflectors were analyzed by JPL
scientists to calibrate the image used in this picture.  The
calibration team here also deployed transponders (electronic
reflectors) and receivers to measure the radar signals from SIR-
C/X-SAR on the ground.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Isla Isabela 3-D</TITLE>
<H1>Isla Isabela 3-D</H1>
<P>
This is a three-dimensional view of Isabela, one of the Galapagos
Islands located off the western coast of Ecuador, South America. 
This view was constructed by overlaying a Spaceborne Imaging
Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) image on a
digital elevation map produced by TOPSAR, a prototype airborne
interferometric radar which produces simultaneous image and
elevation data.  The vertical scale in this image is exaggerated
by a factor of 1.87.  The SIR-C/X-SAR image was taken on the 40th
orbit of space shuttle Endeavour.  The image is centered at about
0.5 degree south latitude and 91 degrees west longitude and
covers an area of 75 by 60 kilometers (47 by 37 miles).  The
radar incidence angle at the center of the image is about 20
degrees.  The western Galapagos Islands, which lie about 1,200
kilometers (750 miles) west of Ecuador in the eastern Pacific,
have six active volcanoes similar to the volcanoes found in
Hawaii and reflect the volcanic processes that occur where the
ocean floor is created.  Since the time of Charles Darwin's visit
to the area in 1835, there have been more than 60 recorded
eruptions on these volcanoes.  This SIR-C/X-SAR image of Alcedo
and Sierra Negra volcanoes shows the rougher lava flows as bright
features, while ash deposits and smooth pahoehoe lava flows
appear dark.  Vertical exaggeration of relief is a common tool
scientists use to detect relationships between structure (for
example, faults, and fractures) and topography.

<TITLE>Interferometry - Long Valley, California 3-D</TITLE>
<H1>Long Valley, California 3-D</H1>
<P>
This is a three-dimensional perspective view of Long Valley, 
California by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar on board the space shuttle 
Endeavour.  This view was constructed by overlaying a color 
composite SIR-C image on a digital elevation map.  The 
digital elevation map was produced using radar 
interferometry, a process by which radar data are acquired 
on different passes of the space shuttle and, which then, 
are compared to obtain elevation information. The data were 
acquired on April 13, 1994 and on October 3, 1994, during 
the first and second flights of the SIR-C/X-SAR radar 
instrument. The color composite radar image was produced by 
assigning red to the C-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received) polarization; green to the C-band 
(vertically transmitted and received) polarization; and blue 
to the ratio of the two data sets.  Blue areas in the image 
are smooth and yellow areas are rock outcrops with varying 
amounts of snow and vegetation.  The view is looking north 
along the northeastern edge of the Long Valley caldera, a 
volcanic collapse feature created 750,000 years ago and the 
site of continued subsurface activity.  Crowley Lake is off 
the image to the left.

<TITLE>Interferometry - San Rafael Galcier, Chile</TITLE>
<h1>San Rafael Galcier, Chile
</h1>

<P>
A NASA radar instrument has been successfully used to measure some of
the fastest moving and most inaccessible glaciers in the
world -- in Chile's huge, remote Patagonia ice fields -- demonstrating a
technique that could produce more accurate predictions of
glacial response to climate change and corresponding sea level changes.
This image, produced with interferometric measurements made
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) flown on the Space Shuttle last fall, has
provided the first detailed measurements of the mass and motion of the
San Rafael Glacier. Very few measurements have been made of
the Patagonian ice fields, which are the world's largest mid-latitude
ice masses and account for more than 60 percent of the Southern
Hemisphere's glacial area outside of Antarctica. These features make the
area essential for climatologists attempting to understand the
response of glaciers on a global scale to changes in climate, but the
region's inaccessibility and inhospitable climate have made it nearly
impossible for scientists to study its glacial topography, meteorology
and changes over time. Currently, topographic data exist for only
a few glaciers while no data exist for the vast interior of the ice
fields. Velocity has been measured on only five of the more than 100
glaciers, and the data consist of only a few single-point measurements.
The interferometry performed by the SIR-C/X-SAR was used
to generate both a digital elevation model of the glaciers and a map of
their ice motion on a pixel-per-pixel basis at very high
resolution for the first time. The data were acquired from nearly the
same position in space on October 9, 10 and 11, 1994, at L-band
frequency (24-cm wavelength), vertically transmitted and received
polarization, as the Space Shuttle Endeavor flew over several
Patagonian outlet glaciers of the San Rafael Laguna. The area shown in
these two images is 50 kilometers by 30 kilometers (30 miles
by 18 miles) in size and is centered at 46.6 degrees south latitude,
73.8 degrees west longitude. North is toward the upper right. The top
image is a digital elevation model of the scene, where color and
saturation represent terrain height (between 0 meters and 2,000 meters
or up to 6,500 feet) and brightness represents radar backscatter. Low
elevations are shown in blue and high elevations are shown in
pink. The digital elevation map of the glacier surface has a horizontal
resolution of 15 meters (50 feet) and a vertical resolution of 10
meters (30 feet). High-resolution maps like these acquired over several
years would allow scientists to calculate directly long-term
changes in the mass of the glacier. The bottom image is a map of ice
motion parallel to the radar look direction only, which is from the
top of the image. Purple indicates ice motion away from the radar at
more than 6 centimeters per day; dark blue is ice motion toward or
away at less than 6 cm per day; light blue is motion toward the radar of
6 cm to 20 cm (about  2 to 8 inches) per day; green is motion
toward the radar of 20 cm to 45 cm (about 8 to 18 inches) per day;
yellow is 45 cm to 85 cm (about 18 to 33 inches) per day;
orange is 85 cm to 180 cm (about 33 to 71 inches) per day; red is
greater than 180 cm (71 inches)per day. The velocity estimates are
accurate to within 5 millimeters per day. The largest velocities are
recorded on the San Rafael Glacier in agreement with previous
work. Other outlet glaciers exhibit ice velocities of less than 1 meter
per day. Several kilometers before its terminus, (left of center) the
velocity of the San Rafael Glacier exceeds 10 meters (32 feet) per day,
and ice motion cannot be estimated from the data. There, a
revisit time interval of less than 12 hours would have been necessary to
estimate ice motion from interferometry data. The results
however demonstrate that the radar interferometry technique permits the
monitoring of glacier characteristics unattainable by any
other means.

<TITLE>Interferometry - Fort Irwin, California</TITLE>
<H1>Fort Irwin, California</H1>
<P>
This image of Fort Irwin in California's Mojave Desert 
compares interferometric radar signatures topography -- data 
that were obtained by multiple imaging of the same region  
to produce three-dimensional elevation maps -- as it was 
obtained on October 7-8, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space 
shuttle Endeavour.  Data were acquired using the  L-band (24 
centimeter wavelength) and C-band (6 centimeter wavelength).  
The image covers an area about 25 kilometers by 70 
kilometers (15.5 miles by 43 miles).  North is to the lower 
right of the image.  The color contours shown are 
proportional to the topographic elevation. With a wavelength 
one-fourth that of the L-band, the results from the C-band 
cycle through the color contours four times faster for a 
given elevation change.  Detailed comparisions of these 
multiple frequency data over different terrain types will 
provide insights in the future into wavelength-dependent 
effects of penetration and scattering on the topography 
measurement accuracy.  Fort Irwin is an ideal site for such 
detailed digital elevation model comparisions because a 
number of high precision digital models of the area already 
exist from conventional measurements as well as from 
airborne interferometric SAR data.

kilometers by 13 kilometers (5.5 miles by 8 miles) and is 
centered at about 19.58 degrees north latitude and 155.55 
degrees west longitude. This image and a similar image taken 
during the first flight of the radar instrument on April 13, 
1994 were combined to produce the topographic information by 
means of an interferometric process. This is a process by 
which radar data acquired on different passes of the space 
shuttle is overlaid to obtain elevation information. Three 
additional images are provided showing an overlay of radar 
data with interferometric fringes; a three-dimensional image 
based on altitude lines; and, finally, a topographic view of 
the region.

<H1>Kilauea interferometry #2</H1>
<P>
Data acquired on April 13, 1994 and on October 4, 1994 from 
the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on board the space 
shuttle Endeavour were used to generate interferometric 
fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.  
The volcano is centered in this image at 19.58 degrees north 
latitude and 155.55 degrees west longitude.  The image 
covers about 9 kilometers by 13 kilometers (5.6 miles by 8 
miles).  The X-band fringes correspond clearly to the 
expected topographic image.  The yellow line indicates the 
area below which was used for the three-dimensional image 
using altitude lines.  The yellow rectangular frame fences 
the area for the final topographic image.

<P> 
This three-dimensional image of the volcano Kilauea was 
generated based on interferometric fringes derived from two 
X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar data takes on April 13, 1994 
and October 4, 1994. The altitude lines are based on 
quantitative interpolation of the topographic fringes. The 
level difference between neighboring altitude lines is 20 
meters (66 feet).  The ground area covers 12 kilometers by 4 
kilometers (7.5 miles by 2.5 miles).  The altitude 
difference in the image is about 500 meters (1,640 feet).  
The volcano is located around 19.58 degrees north latitude 
and 155.55 degrees west longitude.

<TITLE>Interferometry - Long Valley, California</TITLE>
<H1>Long Valley, California</H1>
<P>
An area near Long Valley, California, was mapped by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 13, 1994, 
during the first flight of the radar instrument, and on 
October 4, 1994, during the second flight of the radar 
instrument. The orbital configurations of the two data sets 
were ideal for interferometric combination -- that is 
overlaying the data from one image onto a second image of 
the same area to create an elevation map and obtain 
estimates of topography.  Once the topography is known, any 
radar-induced distortions can be removed and the radar data 
can be geometrically projected directly onto a standard map 
grid for use in a geographical information system. The 50 
kilometer by 50 kilometer (31 miles by 31 miles) map shown 
here is entirely derived from SIR-C L-band radar 
(horizontally transmitted and received) results. The color 
shown in this image is produced from the interferometrically 
determined elevations, while the brightness is determined by 
the radar backscatter. The map is in Universal Transverse 
Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  Elevation contour lines are 
shown every 50 meters (164 feet).  Crowley Lake is the 
dark feature near the south edge of the map.  The Adobe 
Valley in the north and the Long Valley in the south are 
separated by the Glass Mountain Ridge, which runs through 
the center of the image.  The height accuracy of the 
interferometrically derived digital elevation model is 
estimated to be 20 meters (66 feet) in this image.

<TITLE>Interferometry - Long Valley, California interferometr</TITLE>
<H1>Long Valley, California interferometry</H1>
<P>
These four images of the Long Valley region of east-central 
California illustrate the steps required to produced three 
dimensional data and topographics maps from radar 
interferometry.  All data displayed in these images were 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour during its two flights in April and October, 1994.  
The image in the upper left shows L-band (horizontally 
transmitted and received) SIR-C radar image data for an area 
34 by 59 kilometers (21 by 37 miles).  North is toward the 
upper right; the radar illumination is from the top of the 
image.  The bright areas are hilly regions that contain 
exposed bedrock and pine forest.  The darker gray areas are 
the relatively smooth, sparsely vegetated valley floors. The 
dark irregular patch near the lower left is Lake Crowley.  
The curving ridge that runs across the center of the image 
from top to bottom is the northeast rim of the Long Valley 
Caldera, a remnant crater from a massive volcanic eruption 
that occurred about 750,000 years ago.  The image in the 
upper right is an interferogram of the same area, made by 
combining SIR-C L-band data from the April and October 
flights.  The colors in this image represent the difference 
in the phase of the radar echoes obtained on the two 
flights.  Variations in the phase difference are caused by 
elevation differences.  Formation of continuous bands of 
phase differences, known as interferometric "fringes", is 
only possible if the two observations were acquired from 
nearly the same position in space.  For these April and 
October data takes, the shuttle tracks were less than 100 
meters (328 feet) apart. The image in the lower left shows a 
topographic map derived from the interferometric data.  The 
colors represent increments of elevation, as do the thin 
black contour lines, which are spaced at 50-meter (164-foot) 
elevation intervals.  Heavy contour lines show 250-meter 
intervals (820-foot).  Total relief in this area is about 
1,320 meters (4,330 feet).  Brightness variations come from 
the radar image, which has been geometrically corrected to 
remove radar distortions and rotated to have north toward 
the top.  The image in the lower right is a three-
dimensional perspective view of  the northeast rim of the 
Long Valley caldera, looking toward the northwest.  SIR-C C-
band radar image data are draped over topographic data 
derived from the interferometry processing.  No vertical 
exaggeration has been applied. Combining topographic and 
radar image data allows scientists to examine relationships 
between geologic structures and landforms, and other 
properties of the land cover, such as soil type, vegetation 
distribution and hydrologic characteristics.

<b></b><p>
<b></b>In June 1994 NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth (OMTPE) identified
the need for a broadly scoped review of the nation's civilian spaceborne
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) program, and requested the Committee on 
Earth
Studies (CES) of the Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Research Council
(NRC) to undertake such a review.  The Board was charged with answering the
following questions:<p>
<p>
(1)	Is multiparameter SAR the optimum spaceborne approach to 
characterize the
critical geophysical parameters identified by the interdisciplinary 
Spaceborne
Imaging Radar-C, X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) Earth 
science
team, and if not, are the data products nevertheless of credible utility in
Earth science? For example:<p>
<p>
*	How well can SAR be used to estimate biomass, characterize vegetation 
type,
characterize forest stand maturity, clear-cut, or regrowth?<p>
<p>
*	How well can SAR be used to characterize snow-water equivalent, 
distinguish
between new and refrozen ice, or estimate ice volume?<p>
<p>
*	How well can SAR characterize oceanographic features and parameters 
such as
internal waves, oil slicks, wave direction, and air-sea interaction?<p>
<p>
*	How well can SAR characterize soil moisture?<p>
<p>
*	How well can SAR characterize geologic features such as rock
type/composition, and surface texture?<p>
<p>
(2)	With respect to all of the above questions, how important are the 
multiple
wavelength, multi-polarizing, variable-incidence angle capabilities to these
characterizations?<p>
<p>
(3)	What is the potential of spaceborne radar interferometry in 
topographic
mapping and surface change monitoring connected with natural hazards?<p>
<p>
(4)	What is the complementary nature of a spaceborne radar 
interferometry
project to monitoring crustal strain and deploying dense arrays of Global
Positioning System (GPS) receivers in selected areas of seismic hazard?<p>
<p>
(5)	What are the priorities in SAR technology development which are 
critical
not only to NASA's maintaining leadership in spaceborne SAR technology, but 
to
providing societally relevant geophysical parameters?<p>
<p>
(6)	What is the priority of SAR science in the context of the overall national
and international Earth observing areas?<p>
<p>
(7)	With the answers to these questions as backdrop, how might the
international space program community make the best use of its resources 
while
satisfying individual programmatic requirements through joint planning and
cooperation in future SAR flight projects?<p>
<p>
(8)	What would an appropriate role be for NASA in such an international 
SAR
program?  For example:<p>
<p>
*	What would an appropriate role be for the NASA Earth Observing System 
Data
and Information System (EOSDIS) in such a program?<p>
<p>
*	How could the SIR-C/X-SAR or the EOS SAR Science Team expertise be 
used?<p>
<p>
This report was prepared as background material through a series of
discipline-oriented workshops held throughout the fall of 1994. Science
Discipline Panel workshops and meetings, held in Late October and early
November focused on Questions 1-4. The Technology Panel addressed Question 5
during two separate meetings on November 15 and 29. An Interagency panel 
formed
to help address Questions 6-8 will report separately. The Chairmen of the
Discipline Panels met on December 5, 1994 to discuss the report format and
their key findings.  Because of the broad interest in this subject, attempts
have been made to solicit input and comments on this material from as broad a
community as time allowed, including the international community. However, 
this
should only be considered a "snap-shot" of a rapidly evolving field, as new
results are reported on a continuing basis.<p>

<h1>1--Executive
Summary
</a></h1></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>
<a name="RTFToC5">INTRODUCTION</a><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
This report provides a context in which questions put forth by NASA' s Office
of Mission to Planet Earth (OMTPE) regarding the next steps in spaceborne
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) science and technology can be addressed.  It
summarizes the state-of-the-art in theory, experimental design, technology,
data analysis and utilization of SAR data for studies of the Earth, and
describes potential new applications.  <p>
<p>
This report is divided into five science chapters and a technology assessment.
The science chapters are Ecology, Hydrology, Marine Science and 
Applications,
Ice Sheets and Glaciers, and Solid Earth Sciences and Topography.  Each 
Chapter
outlines key science questions in the context of Mission to Planet Earth that
can be addressed with SAR data.  In addition, the chapters summarize the value
of existing SAR data and currently planned SAR systems, and identify gaps in
observational capabilities that need to be filled to address the scientific
questions.  Both demonstrated and potential capabilities are described, with
appropriate references cited.  Both NASA and non-NASA sources of SAR data 
are
included, and the importance of multiple wavelengths, multiple polarizations,
and variable incidence angles are substantiated for each measurement. A 
summary
of sensors is included as an Appendix. Cases where SAR provides 
complementary
data to other (non-SAR) measurement techniques are also described. <p>
<p>
The chapter on technology assessment outlines SAR technology development 
which
is critical not only to NASA's providing societally relevant geophysical
parameters, but to  maintaining competitiveness in SAR technology, and
promoting economic development. <p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC6">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
SAR data provide unique information about the health of the planet and its
biodiversity, as well as critical data for natural hazards and resource
assessments. Interferometric measurement capabilities uniquely provided by 
SAR
are required to generate global topographic maps, to monitor surface
topographic change, and to monitor glacier ice velocity and ocean features.
Multiparameter SAR data are crucial for accurate land cover classification,
measuring above-ground woody plant biomass, delineation of wetland 
inundation,
measurement of snow and soil moisture, characterization of oil slicks, and
monitoring of sea ice thickness. <p>
<p>
The suite of spaceborne SAR systems and programs currently envisioned by 
the
international community provides an important framework for addressing 
key
science issues and applications. However, additional activities, and
interferometric/multiparameter measurement capabilities are required for
long-term environmental monitoring and commercial applications. <p>
<p>
This report recommends NASA take an aggressive leadership role in an
international SAR program to meet these needs. Specific near-term steps 
should
be to:<p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Establish interagency and international SAR science teams.</b>  
These
teams would be funded to exploit data from both NASA and non-NASA sources, 
and
would be charged with development and testing/validation of new 
applications,
both scientific and commercial in nature.<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>Initiate an advanced technology effort.</b>  The initial focus of such 
a
program should be on lowering the costs of the operational elements and
exploiting the functionality of SAR. The NASA airborne radar (AIRSAR) which
flies on the NASA DC-8 should be the focus of this activity.<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Design an evolvable flight program.</b>  The long-term objective of 
such
a program is an operational interferometric, multiparameter spaceborne SAR 
for
long-term environmental monitoring and commercial applications.  
Immediate
steps toward this goal are to initiate an interferometric spaceborne mission,
and to continue multiparameter measurements through additional flights of 
the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C, X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) 
as a
free-flyer or on the Space Shuttle.<p>

<a name="RTFToC8">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
The past five years have seen significant growth in research focused on
developing approaches for using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to study
ecological processes.  During this time, we have seen the development of a
number of advanced airborne SAR systems, and the deployment of three 
spaceborne
SAR systems: ERS-1, JERS-

1,
and SIR-C/X-SAR.  Additional spaceborne SARs will be deployed through the
remainder of this decade and into the next, including ERS-2, RADARSAT, and 
ASAR
(see Appendix B).<p>
<p>
The deployment of the multi-frequency, polarimetric SIR-C/X-SAR 
instruments on
two Space Shuttle missions in April and October 1994 represents a milestone in
the history of imaging radars.  The data collected during these missions
provide an important opportunity to further evaluate the utility of imaging
radar data for examining surface characteristics important in a wide range of
ecological processes.<p>
<p>
Ecologists are generally aware of the utility of remote sensing data for
studying processes at landscape scales.  However, imaging radar data, such as
that collected by synthetic aperture radars, have received less attention than
optical data.  Hindrances to use of SAR systems have included: (1) difficulty
of understanding the information content of the complex phase and amplitude
information recorded in multifrequency, polarimetric SAR data; (2) the lack of
available, calibrated data over sites of interest; (3) the lack of accessible
computer software to exploit the information present in the data; and (4)
certain characteristics of SAR data, including relief displacement and image
speckle.  Computer software and hardware have developed to the point where 
most
of the technological constraints of using SAR data have dissipated.  In
addition, a great deal of calibrated SAR imagery exists and is being collected
by several airborne and satellite systems.  This chapter focuses on our current
understanding of the information content of SAR imagery with respect to
ecological applications, based on recent research results.<p>
<p>
In November 1994, a working group of scientists met on the campus of the
University of California (Santa Barbara) to perform a critical review of the
use of imaging radars to estimate surface characteristics important for the
study of terrestrial ecosystem processes.  The consensus of this group was that
the ability of imaging radars to detect ecologically important characteristics
of vegetated landscapes is well founded in both theory and observation.  The
working group felt the demonstrated capabilities of imaging radars for
investigating terrestrial ecosystems could best be organized into four broad
categories: (1) classification and detection of change in land cover; (2)
estimation of woody plant biomass; (3) monitoring the extent and timing of
inundation; and (4) monitoring other temporally dynamic processes, such as
freeze/thaw status and soil moisture in fire-disturbed boreal forests.<p>
<p>
This review is organized in the following manner:  First, we present a brief
review of the origins of the signatures recorded in a SAR image collected over
a vegetated terrain.  Then, we discuss each of the four topical areas,
including an overview of the scientific importance or application of the topic
area and a review of the demonstrated capabilities of SAR to provide
information necessary to provide specific inputs.  This is followed by a
discussion of the optimal system configurations for specific ecological
applications and an assessment of the capabilities of existing SAR systems
(including SIR-C/X-SAR) and those scheduled for launch in the near future to
provide information required for the application areas.  Finally, we present
recommendations for future SAR programs within the Mission to Planet Earth
(MTPE) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC9">BACKGROUND</a><p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC10">Radar
Sensing of Vegetated Landscapes:  Physical Basis
</a><p>
<p>
Microwave backscatter is highly dependent on the orientation and size
distribution of the scattering elements present within the region being 
imaged.
Because of their high moisture content, individual components of forest
canopies and other vegetative covers (e.g., leaves, branches, trunks) 
represent
discrete scattering and absorbing elements to the microwave power 
transmitted
by imaging radars.  Variations in the microwave dielectric constant of
vegetation elements or ground surface play a central role in determining the
magnitude and phase of the microwave energy which is scattered from a 
vegetated
surface and recorded and processed into a SAR image.  Factors influencing the
dielectric constant of vegetated surfaces include temperature of the scattering
medium, relative moisture content of vegetation, soil, and snow cover, and the
presence of water on vegetation.<p>
<p>
Microwave scattering from land surfaces is strongly dependent on the size and
orientation of the different elements comprising the vegetation.  At longer
radar wavelengths (P- and L-bands, 67 and 24 cm wavelengths), microwave
scattering and absorption results from interactions with the tree boles and
larger branches found within forests, as well as the ground surface.  At these
wavelengths, the smaller woody stems and the foliage act mainly as 
attenuators.
At shorter radar wavelengths, (C- and X-bands, 6 and 3 cm wavelengths),
microwave scattering and absorption results from interactions from smaller
branches and leaves and needles in the canopy.  The presence of a
water-saturated or flooded surface leads to increased double-bounce scattering
that enhances the strength of the ground-vegetation interaction term.  
Finally,
the polarization combination of the received backscatter is dependent on the
polarization of the transmitted microwave power and on the horizontal and/or
vertical orientation of the scattering elements present in the vegetation.<p>
<p>
Modeling clearly shows the differential dependence of microwave backscatter 
on
the overall structure of vegetation canopies and on the variations in the
characteristics of the ground layer.  These models treat a forest stand either
as a set of continuous horizontal layers (Richards et al., 1987; Durden et al.,
1989; Sun and Simonett, 1990; Ulaby et al., 1990; Chauhan et al., 1991) or as a
discontinuous layer with individual trees acting as distinct scattering centers
(Sun et al., 1991; McDonald and Ulaby, 1993).  Both model classes are similar
in that they calculate the same major scattering terms: (1) volume scattering
from the tree canopy (the branches and leaves/needles); (2) direct ground
scattering; (3) ground-to-trunk scattering; (4) ground-to-crown scattering; 
and
(5) ground-to-crown-to-ground scattering.  (<a href="fig2.1.gif">Figure
2-1</a> presents examples of outputs from the theoretical model of Ulaby
et al.,  1990).  Most models use formulations which assume the tree trunks and
branches can be modeled as lossy dielectric cylinders, and the leaves or
needles as dielectric discs or cylinders, respectively.<p>
<p>
A three-dimensional microwave backscatter model for forest canopies, which
allows explicit spatial arrangement of scatterers, has been published (Sun and
Ranson, 1995).  Scattering models have been exercised and validated using SAR
and scatterometer data collected over a wide range of vegetation canopies (Sun
and Simonett, 1988; Chauhan et al., 1991; Durden et al., 1989; Lang et al.,
1994; McDonald et al., 1990, 1991; Moghaddan et al., 1994; Way et al., 1994;
Ranson and Sun, 1994; Wang et al., 1993a, 1993b, 1994a).  Because of their
complexity, however, these models have not proved invertible to allow
estimation of surface and canopy characteristics needed to study specific
ecological features or processes.  The value of these models lies in their
utility in understanding the dependence of microwave backscatter on system 
and
imaging parameters (frequency, polarization, and viewing geometry of the
transmitted microwave radiation) and the basic geometric characteristics of 
the
vegetated surface being studied (<a href="fig2.2.gif">Figure 2-2</a>).  In
addition, these models have also been useful in developing an understanding 
of
the effects of temporally varying factors which influence microwave
backscatter, including soil moisture (Wang et al., 1994b), air temperature
(Rignot et al., 1994a), and flooding (Wang et al., 1995) (<a
href="fig2.3.gif">Figure 2-3</a>).  This understanding has proven
critical in developing approaches to use SAR data in algorithms to estimate
specific surface characteristics (see, e.g., Dobson et al., 1995c; Wang et al.,
1994a; Kasischke et al., 1994a; and Rignot and Way, 1994).<p>

OF SAR

<p>
<a name="RTFToC12">Land
Cover Classification
</a><p>
<p>
Ecologists use remote sensing technologies for two distinct purposes.  The
first addresses the fundamental ecological goal to understand relationships
between organisms and their environments.  To this end, remote sensing is 
used
for interpretation of landscape patterns, examination of correlations among
physical and biotic parameters, and extrapolation of known relationships to
larger spatial scales.  The second application involves using information
derived from remote sensing systems in the study of specific ecosystem
processes.<p>
<p>
Vegetation classifications make possible studies of successional rates;
landscape change; vegetation productivity and biomass; and effects of
disturbances such as flooding, fires, disease, and harvesting or logging.
These provide inputs for modeling of a variety of ecosystem processes, such as
forest succession; vegetation/atmospheric exchanges of energy and water; and
local, regional, and global-scale biogeochemical cycling.<p>
<p>
Further terrestrial applications for remotely sensed data sets include
inventory of forest resources, monitoring agricultural crops, locating
vegetation containing particular species of interest, and monitoring land use
and land-use change.  Users of land cover classifications include plant and
animal ecologists, modelers including those operating general circulation
models (GCMs), land managers, government agencies, and economic 
forecasters.
All applications require the classification of vegetation into types and the
delineation of the structural and compositional boundaries of biotic
communities.<p>
<p>
For many ecological studies, there is a need for current information on the
distribution and amount of vegetation.  This need has not been fully addressed
by a quarter century of spaceborne remote sensing systems operating in the
visible and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Collection
of visible/near-infrared imagery over ecologically important regions on a
continuous basis is often limited by cloud cover, particularly in tropical and
boreal biomes.<p>
<p>
Image classification algorithms discriminate based on features extracted from
the spectral,  spatial, or temporal domains.  Two general image classification
approaches have been applied to SAR data: (1) maximum-likelihood classifiers
including supervised and unsupervised cluster analysis and (2) knowledge-
based
techniques such as hierarchical decision trees and those based on 
determination
of dominant scattering mechanisms from electromagnetic theory.  A key issue 
for
any of these approaches is how consistent or stable the classifier is when
applied to new regions or the same region at different times.<p>
<p>
A summary of the demonstrated capabilities of SAR-derived classification is
given in <a href="tab2.1.gif">Table 2-1</a> and <a
href="fig2.4.gif">Figure 2-4</a>.  This material is not intended to be
all-inclusive, but draws examples from a number of ecosystems as recently
reported in the literature.  Manual classification of airborne SAR imagery
provided the first comprehensive mapping of many tropical areas in the 
1970's.
The most notable of these was project RADAM in Brazil.  Unsupervised
classification of digital SAR imagery is a useful tool for characterizing
landscapes without adequate vegetation maps (e.g., Pope et al., 1994).  Most
recent classification efforts have used supervised maximum likelihood
approaches; these often lead to high classification accuracies for a given
scene (de Grandi, et al., 1994; Lemoine, et al., 1994; Ranson and Sun, 1994;
Rignot and Chellappa, 1992; Rignot et al., 1993).  When applied to temporal
sequences of images, this technique implicitly incorporates ancillary 
knowledge
such as phenologic development or cropping calendars.  The extendibility of
supervised maximum likelihood techniques to regional or global scales is
impaired by the need for local training.  The knowledge-based techniques may
overcome this limitation by first classifying on the basis of explicit
relationships between radar backscatter and structural attributes (Dobson et
al., 1995b; Pierce et al., 1994; van Zyl, 1989).  These structural classes can
then be relabelled locally on the basis of known linkages between structure 
and
floristic community.  At present, such classifiers have been successfully
tested locally.<p>
<p>
SAR can clearly (1) detect major hydrologic changes such as inundation (<a
href="fig2.3.gif">Figure 2-3</a>, Ormsby et al., 1985; Morrissey et
al., 1994, 1995; Hess et al., 1995), the presence of intercepted precipitation
(Ulaby et al., 1983), and freeze/thaw status of vegetation (Rignot and Way,
1994; Way et al., 1994); (2) differentiate major structural differences in
land-cover such as forest versus clear cuts or marshes versus flooded forests
(Beaudoin et al., 1994; de Grandi et al., 1994; Dobson et al., 1995b; Drieman,
1994; Hess and Melack, 1994, Lopes et al., 1993; Lozano-Garcia and Hoffer,
1993; Pierce et al., 1994; Ranson and Sun, 1994), and (3) discriminate crop
cover on the basis of structural attributes (Foody et al., 1994; Lemoine et
al., 1994; van Zyl and Burnette, 1992).  In addition, major height classes
within a given vegetation type can be detected.  Compositional variations
within major vegetation types (physiognomic types) are not as readily
distinguished, but can be separated with use of multitemporal, multifrequency
and/or multipolarization imagery (Ahern et al., 1993; Drieman, 1994).<p>
<p>
In regions characterized by persistent cloud-cover (e.g., boreal regions,
tropical forest and much of Northern Europe), SAR may be the only viable
alternative for classification of actual land-cover.  In other regions, SAR is
very useful as it provides information on structure and moisture status that is
complementary to the information provided by optical sensing techniques
(Lozano-Garcia and Hoffer, 1993).  Moreover, SAR has a generic advantage 
over
optical sensors because atmospheric correction is not needed.  In addition, a
number of studies have shown the power of multidate imagery for enhanced
classification results (Ranson and Sun, 1994).  Orbital SAR has proven itself
to be very reliable for provision of multidate data because it is practically
insensitive to local weather conditions.  The calibration stability of existing
satellite SARs makes it possible to incorporate time-dependent ancillary
information, such as phenological development and cropping calendars, into
classification.<p>
<p>
A complication to SAR-derived land-cover classification is that imposed by
topographic relief.  In severe cases, the layover and shadowing produced by
mountainous terrain makes classification inappropriate for these regions 
unless
azimuth and viewing geometry have been carefully considered in the SAR 
sampling
strategy.  In less severe cases, the ancillary digital elevation data have been
used to generate approximate corrections for terrain effects prior to
classification.  A second limitation is the spatial resolution of a given SAR.
Landscape patches cannot be unambiguously discriminated and classified 
unless
they are much greater than the spatial resolution (for a single-look image).
In general, classification of patch sizes <~2000 m<sup>2</sup> (i.e., ~45m x
45 m) is not practical from spaceborne SAR.<p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Measuring
Above-Ground Woody Plant Biomass
</a><p>
<p>
The amount and distribution of biomass over the Earth's land surface is one of
the major uncertainties in our ability to understand the global carbon cycle
and how it may change in the future (Post, 1993).  The living and dead biomass
in both above and below-ground storage pools constitutes a major terrestrial
store of carbon.  Our knowledge of the biomass density within the Earth's
terrestrial biomes is quite limited due to the difficulty of obtaining
sufficient high quality observations that are representative of a region or
ecosystem type (Smith et al., 1993; Dixon et al., 1994).  Measurements on the
ground are very time-consuming, labor-intensive and often constrained by 
lack
of access.  The physiological activity of living biomass and the fate of dead
biomass determine the fluxes of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the
atmosphere, and, thus, the accumulation or removal of important greenhouse
gases (primarily carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere.  These
processes are fairly dynamic and subject to change in response to a variety of
environmental factors (e.g., temperature, moisture, nutrient availability) and
patterns of disturbance, both natural (e.g., fire, windthrow, insect-induced
mortality) and anthropogenic (deforestation, land degradation) (e.g., Solomon
and Cramer, 1993).<p>
<p>
Numerous studies have demonstrated that approaches using optical remotely
sensed data do not work for most terrestrial biomass densities, because there
is a saturation effect at very low levels of biomass.  Currently, radar remote
sensing appears to offer the greatest promise for obtaining estimates of
biomass via remote sensing techniques.<p>
<p>
The dependence of microwave backscatter on total above-ground biomass has 
been
documented in monospecific pine forests found in the southeastern U.S. (<a
href="fig2.5.gif">Figure 2-5</a>) and France (Dobson et al., 1992;
Kasischke et al., 1994a; LeToan et al., 1992), mixed deciduous and coniferous
forests of Maine, northern Michigan, and Alaska (Ranson et al., 1994; Dobson 
et
al., 1994; Harrell et al., 1995; Rignot et al., 1994), and coniferous forests
of the Pacific Northwest (Moghaddam et al., 1994).  These studies all show the
same results: (1) the sensitivity of microwave backscatter to biomass
variations saturates after a certain level is reached; and (2) the biomass
dependence of microwave backscatter varies as a function of radar 
wavelength
and polarization (<a href="fig2.6.gif">Figure 2-6</a>).  In
summary, the saturation point is higher for longer wavelengths, and the HV
polarization is most sensitive and VV the least.<p>
<p>
A conclusion drawn by some scientists is these single-frequency saturation
levels represent the upper limit of SAR's ability to monitor changes or
differences in aboveground biomass in forests (Waring et al., 1994).  However,
this conclusion overlooks several important considerations.  Microwave
backscatter is correlated with total biomass and various components of biomass
(e.g., branch biomass, needle biomass, bole biomass) or other physical
characteristics (e.g., tree height, basal area) (Dobson et al., 1995c; Hussin
et al., 1991; Kasischke et al., 1994a).  This should not be surprising, since
we know that different biomass components of trees are closely correlated.
Since different radar frequencies and polarization combinations are sensitive
to different layers of a forest canopy, it should be possible to use multiple
channels of SAR data to estimate total above-ground biomass.  Recent research
supports this hypothesis.<p>
<p>
Kasischke et al., (1994a) used a two-stage approach to estimate biomass of
southern pine forests using JPL AIRSAR data.  In step one, total branch 
biomass
was estimated as a function of several different radar
frequencies/polarizations.  Total biomass was then estimated from branch
biomass based upon allometric equations, and resulted in a relative error on
the order of 20% for biomass levels up to 400 t ha<sup>-1</sup>.  Ranson et
al., (1994) used a ratio of P-band HV (PHV) and C-band HV (CHV) to estimate
total biomass (up to 250 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) in mixed coniferous/deciduous
forests in Maine. This technique was applied to SIR-C/X-SAR LHV and CHV data 
to
estimate boreal forest biomass up to 200 tons/ha within <u>+</u>20 tons/ha
(Ranson and Sun, 1995). Finally, Dobson et al., (1995c) used a multi-step,
semi-empirical approach to estimate aboveground biomass from a combination 
of
channels from SIR-C data collected over a mixed coniferous/deciduous forest 
in
northern Michigan.  In this approach, different SAR frequency/polarization
combinations were used to estimate canopy-layer biomass, total height and 
total
basal area, which were then used to estimate total biomass.  Biomass estimates
up to 250 t ha<sup>-1</sup> with an uncertainty on the order of 16 t
ha<sup>-1</sup> were achieved (<a href="fig2.7.gif">Figure
2-7</a>).<p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Delineation
of Wetland Inundation and Vegetative Cover
</a><p>
<p>
The availability of SAR data from airborne and satellite platforms has provided
a unique opportunity to study dynamic wetland processes, information critical
for the study of many ecosystem processes and applications.  In this section,
we discuss using SAR for several wetlands issues, including biogenic trace gas
exchanges, monitoring the effects of rises in the average sea levels, and
monitoring disease vectors.<p>
<p>
In studies of biogenic trace gas exchange, remotely sensed data can provide
unique information on the type and distribution of wetlands and on temporal
distribution of inundation.  Uncertainties in the spatial and seasonal extent
of methane source and sink areas remain one of the greatest unknowns in the
global methane budget (Bartlett and Harriss, 1993).  Natural wetlands comprise
the largest natural source of atmospheric methane (Aselmann and Crutzen, 
1989;
Fung et al., 1991).  Hence, characterization of the areal and temporal extent
of global wetlands would greatly extend our understanding of trace gas 
exchange
from these ecosystems and of their significance to global processes.<p>
<p>
Recent results using data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON radar altimeter has 
provided
clear evidence that average sea levels are rising, at a rate of several
millimeters per year (Nerem).  These observations support evidence derived 
from
tidal gages that sea levels have been rising over the past half century.  The
distribution of different vegetation species in coastal wetlands, especially
estuaries, is highly sensitive to levels of tidal inundation.  Monitoring
changes in inundation and vegetation patterns in coastal wetlands will 
provide
a key means to monitor the progression and effects of rises in sea level.<p>
<p>
Finally, insect-borne organisms cause disease outbreaks throughout much of 
the
developing world, particularly in the southern hemisphere.  Many of these
diseases are carried and transmitted by various species of mosquitoes.  In
regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, mosquito populations increase
dramatically when breeding sites flood during prolonged episodes of high
rainfall.  Accurate maps of vegetation inundation are critical in identifying
breeding grounds for disease vectors and in predicting and monitoring 
outbreaks
of a variety of diseases.<p>
<p>
For most scientific questions involving wetlands, it is necessary to
distinguish not only flooded from non-flooded areas, but herbaceous from 
woody
vegetation.  For example, in floodplains of the central Amazon, methane
generation rates from floating meadows are much higher than those from 
flooded
forest.  Delineation of both flooding status and vegetation, with accuracies
greater than 90% for all categories, has been demonstrated using
multi-frequency, polarimetric SAR data sets for wetlands in the southeastern
United States (JPL AIRSAR) and the central Amazon (SIR-C) (Melack et al., 
1994;
Hess et al., 1995).<p>
<p>
The ability to penetrate the extensive cloud cover of northern and equatorial
latitudes and to detect standing water beneath vegetation canopies is unique to
SAR (Hess et al., 1990).  In northern Alaska, for example, cloud cover and
infrequent repeat cycles have limited the acquisition of optical satellite data
(Landsat and SPOT) to a total of two scenes for the last 20 years.  By
comparison, ~50 scenes of ERS-1 SAR data have been acquired for Barrow over 
a
two-year period, and RADARSAT will provide daily access.  Similarly, in the
equatorial regions of Manaus, Brazil, between 0 and 2 Landsat scenes are
available each year.<p>
<p>
SAR has proven useful in delineating inundation, a key indicator of the
anaerobic conditions necessary for methane production.  Backscatter from 
ERS-1
SAR acquired over Barrow, Alaska in 1991 is strongly related to the position of
the local water table and thus to methane exchange rates (<a
href="fig2.8.gif">Figure 2-8</a>;  Morrissey et al., 1994).
Backscatter from non-inundated sites was low, that from herbaceous inundated
sites was high, and that from sites with the water table at the surface was
intermediate, mirroring methane exchange rates for the region.<p>
<p>
The capability to differentiate wetland source areas and non-wetlands with 
SAR
is further enhanced by the availability of time series ERS-1 SAR data
(Kasischke et al., 1995a).  Seasonal changes in microwave backscatter for
northern wetlands and non-wetlands are shown in <a
href="fig2.9.gif">Figure 2-9</a>.  Under an extended period of
freezing temperatures in winter of 1992, radar returns for wetland and
non-wetland did not differ significantly.  Following snowmelt in the spring of
1992, backscatter for wetlands was consistently higher than that from
non-wetlands.  With the onset of colder temperatures and decreasing daylight 
in
late summer, backscatter for both wetlands and non-wetlands decreased
dramatically with freezing (Way and Rignot, 1994).  These time series SAR data
provide the only basis for an ongoing effort to map tundra wetlands on a 
global
basis because cloud cover precludes using visible/near-IR channel imagery to
monitor this biome on a continuing basis.<p>
<p>
The sensitivity of microwave backscatter to vegetation and surface make SARs 
an
attractive tool for characterizing wetland communities.  While species
composition per se usually cannot be detected with single-channel SAR, plant
communities often can be, due to differences in vegetation height, density, or
architecture.  For example, a recent study using airborne SAR data collected
over wetlands in Belize showed that a high degree of separability between the
different vegetation communities could be achieved using a variety of indices
based upon different radar frequencies and polarizations (Pope et al., 1994).
Field studies of the same Belizean marsh communities demonstrate that
vegetation species, composition,  and biomass correlate well with salinity and
nutrient gradients (Rejmankova et al., 1995).  Given these relationships, the
spatial distribution of wetland types and inundation patterns can be used to
infer much about the chemistry and flow of surface and near-surface 
waters.<p>
<p>
Studies by Tanis et al. (pri. comm., paper in review with <i>Rem. Sens.
Environ.</i>) have shown that ERS-1 SAR imagery can discriminate between
flooded and non-flooded areas in a coastal estuarine ecosystem along the Gulf
Coast of Florida.  Examination of tidal gage data revealed that the flooding
detected on the ERS-1 imagery was due to variations in tidal stage.  Techniques
were developed to map the ranges of tidal flooding based on comparison of 
ERS-1
SAR imagery collected at high and low tides.<p>
<p>
Another important issue in applied wetland ecology is the role of wetlands as
breeding sites for mosquitoes that transmit a variety of diseases.  Pope et
al., (1992) used airborne X-, C- and L-band SAR data to examine flooding in
sedge and grass-covered mosquito larval habitats in Kenya.  LHH data provided
the best flood detection in both wetland types, but CHH and LVV also provided
limited detection capability.  The radar data (backscatter magnitude only) were
not adequate for habitat mapping, which was accomplished with TM data.  In
contrast, the multifrequency, polarimetric airborne SAR data collected over 
the
wetlands in Belize (Pope et al., 1994) were capable of mapping
<i>Eleocharis</i> sp. dominated marshes, which have been shown to be 
important
breeding habitats of the malaria vector <i>Anopheles albimanus</i>  
(Rejmankova
et al., 1993).  In summary, SAR data hold great promise for malaria risk
assessment efforts in Belize and adjacent regions by providing spatial and
temporal information on the distribution and flooding status of anopheline
breeding sites.<p>

<p>
<a name="RTFToC15">Monitoring
of Dynamic Processes in High-Latitude Ecosystems
</a><p>
<p>
The need to better quantify factors influencing the carbon cycle in northern
biomes stems from several factors.  First, based on current estimates of the
present-day rates of increases in atmospheric carbon concentrations balanced
against oceanic carbon uptake, Tans et al., (1990) concluded that a Northern
Hemisphere terrestrial carbon sink on the order of 2.0 to 3.4 Gt C
yr<sup>-1</sup> is required to balance the global carbon budget.  While Tans et
al., (1990) associate this sink with temperate latitude forests, Bonan
(1991a,b) suggests this sink may actually be a consequence of an imbalance in
production and decomposition in high northern latitude ecosystems (the
terrestrial biomes in high northern latitudes account for >40% of all carbon
sequestered in living and dead biomass).  Second, it is the consensus of most
atmospheric general circulation models that significant warming of the
northern-hemisphere, high latitudes will result from a doubling of 
atmospheric
CO2 concentrations (e.g., McFarlane et al., 1992).  Given that the storage
capacity of high northern latitudes is driven by the low rates of plant
decomposition because of low annual temperatures, the projected temperature
increases in this region will have profound influences on carbon cycling in 
its
terrestrial biomes.<p>
<p>
Uptake and release of CO2 by the boreal forest may account for approximately
50% of the annual seasonal amplitude in atmospheric CO2 at Point Barrow,
Alaska, and ~30% of the seasonal amplitude at Mauna Loa (D'Arrigo et al.,
1987).   Data have shown that the seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2
concentrations in northern latitudes has increased with time.  This may 
reflect
increased metabolic activity of ecosystems in northern latitudes due to warmer
air temperatures and "CO2 fertilization" (Bacastow et al., 1985; Houghton,
1987).  Change to a warmer, drier climate may release more than 1 to 2 Gt C
yr<sup>-1</sup> to the atmosphere from boreal ecosystems due to a variety of
feedbacks (Kasischke et al., 1995b).  In addition to increasing metabolic
activity, increased high latitude temperatures may also extend the growing
season resulting in increased annual productivity, as well as periods of frost
drought which may reduce annual productivity.  Measurements of the length 
of
the growing season may significantly improve current estimates of net 
annual
CO2 flux in the boreal regions (Way et al., 1994). For coniferous species, the
summer frost-free period bounds the growing seasonal length.<p>
<p>
Fires are an extremely important factor to a variety of processes which affect
forest succession and biogeochemical cycles in boreal forests (Bonan and
Shugart, 1989; Kasischke et al., 1995b; Viereck, 1983).  Recent studies show
that global warming may increase the frequency and intensity of fires in 
boreal
forests and result in a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere
(Kasischke et al., 1995b).  Much of the carbon released will come from
increased rates of decomposition in the ground layer.  While global data sets
are not available, records from North America show that an average of 2.5
million hectares have been affected annually by fire over the past decade.
Fires in boreal forests tend to cover large areas, typically greater than 1,000
ha in size.  Fires covering 50,000 to >1,000,000 ha are not uncommon; thus,
satellite remote sensors are an ideal tool for monitoring the locations and
effects of fires in this region.<p>
<p>
The ERS-1 SAR data collected at the Alaskan SAR Facility and Canadian and
European receiving stations have provided a unique opportunity to study
high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems found in North America.  In addition to
monitoring tundra biomes, ERS-1 SAR imagery was used to study boreal forests,
focusing on issues related to the terrestrial carbon cycle.  Specifically, this
research studied the effects of changes in the length of growing season on net
seasonal fluxes of CO2 and the effects of fire on carbon cycling.<p>
<p>
A number of remote sensing instruments may be used to estimate growing 
season
length, and it is likely that a combination of sensors will provide the most
accurate information (Way et al., 1994). The Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR), for example, may provide good estimates of leaf-on 
period,
thus bounding the growing season length for deciduous species. For 
coniferous
species, growing season may be halted when air temperatures drop below
-2 degrees&nbsp;C. For closed canopy forests, canopy temperatures are within 
a
few degrees of air temperatures (Luvall and Holbo, 1989), and can be estimated
using thermal infrared emissions gathered by AVHRR. Access to these data is,
however, limited by cloud cover. A third technique is to measure the length of
the growing season by monitoring freeze/thaw transitions using imaging 
radar
data (<a href="fig2.10.gif">Figure 2-10</a>) (Way et al., 1990; Way
et al., 1994; Rignot et al., 1994; Rignot and Way, 1994). At microwave
frequencies, freezing results in a large decrease of the dielectric constant of
the dielectric constant of soil and vegetation because the crystal structure
prevents the rotation of the polar water molecules contained within the soil
and vegetation.  This phase change results in a drop in radar backscatter of
several dB.<p>
<p>
Over the past several years, scientists have developed a greater understanding
of the role of biomass burning in boreal forest in the global carbon cycle and
the need to monitor these fires on a continuing basis.  Because of their large
sizes and remote locations, satellite sensing systems are now recognized as the
only reliable means to annually locate and estimate the areal extent of fires
in boreal forests (Kasischke and French, 1994).  In 1990 and 1991, over 2
million ha of land surface were affected by fire in Alaska, with most (1.85
million ha) occurring in forested regions.  Studies have shown that these
recent fires resulted in characteristic signatures on ERS-1 SAR imagery
(Kasischke et al., 1992; 1994c).  Field research (Kasischke et al., 1995a) has
shown that the spatial and temporal signatures present on the ERS-1 SAR 
imagery
(<a href="fig2.11.gif">Figure 2-11</a>) are highly correlated with
variations in the moisture found in the top 5 to 10 cm of the soil (<a
href="fig2.12.gif">Figure 2-12</a>).<p>
<p>
Schlenter and VanCleve (1985) have shown that rates of aerobic decomposition 
in
black spruce forests are directly proportional to both temperature and soil
moisture.  Since soil temperatures increase significantly after fires in boreal
forests, the rates of soil respiration in these fire-affected forests should
also increase.  Recent field measurements (Kasischke, pers. comm.) have 
shown
this to be true in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in Alaska, where fluxes
of CH4 and CO2 were greater within the burned sites than unburned sites. 
Areas
which had high soil moistures also had significantly higher rates (by over an
order of magnitude) of CH4 and CO2 fluxes than areas of low soil moisture.  The
ability of SAR data to monitor the spatial and temporal patterns of soil
moisture therefore provides a means to more accurately quantify greenhouse 
gas
emissions from fire-disturbed forests.<p>

SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS
</a><p>
<p>
The wide range of applications discussed in this paper illustrates that there
is probably no one ideal SAR system for ecological applications.  For some
applications, existing or planned single-frequency/polarization systems may
provide an adequate data set.  For other applications these systems are
inadequate.<p>
<p>
To assess SAR system considerations for ecological applications we take the
approach of first defining the system parameters for a specific list of
applications.  We then discuss the potential of existing or planned SAR systems
for these applications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC17">Optimum
System Parameters
</a><p>
<p>
The SAR parameters which define the utility of a specific system for ecological
applications are its frequency, polarization, angle, resolution and sampling
frequency. The common frequencies used today include P-band, L-band, S-
band,
C-band and X-band.  (See Appendix B for details on SAR frequency bands and
instruments used.)  Radars typically transmit horizontally or
vertically-polarized microwave energy and can receive either polarization,
resulting in four linear polarizations - HH, HV, VH, and VV.  Today's
spaceborne SAR systems usually have a fixed center angle between 20 degrees 
and
50 degrees with images covering a few degrees from near edge to far edge.
Future systems will operate in a SCANSAR mode, with image swaths covering a
20 degrees to 50 degrees range in angles.  Today's spaceborne SARs have fairly
fine resolution (20 to 40 m), narrow swath widths (60 to 100 km), and long
sampling frequencies (20 to 40 days).  SCANSAR systems will have the ability to
cover wide areas at lower resolutions (up to 500-km swaths with 100 to 200 m
resolution) and higher sampling frequencies (every 2 to 4 days).<p>

of Existing/Planned SAR Systems
</a><p>
<p>
Three spaceborne imaging radar systems are now in operation or were 
deployed
during the last year: ERS-1, JERS-1 and SIR-C/X-SAR.  The ERS-1 SAR is a C-
band
VV (vertical transmit polarization/vertical receive polarization) launched in
the summer of 1991.  This system has a 25 m resolution and 100 km swath.  The
orbit of this system is tailored such that it has a 35-day exact repeat orbit
during the northern hemisphere summer and fall (which means it can image 
the
same ground location every 18 days or so), and a 3-

day
exact repeat orbit during the winter and spring in order to obtain frequent
coverage of the polar ice cap.  Coverage is limited to locations where ground
receiving stations are installed.  The JERS-1 SAR is an L-band HH system
launched during the summer of 1992.  It has a 25-m resolution and a 75-km
swath.  The exact repeat orbit on this system is 44 days.  Onboard recording
provides global access.  The SIR-C/X-SAR system was flown onboard NASA's 
Space
Shuttle on two ten day missions in April and October of 1994.  This system
consisted of a C- and L-band SAR system that was fully polarimetric (i.e., it
collected HH, HV, VH, and VV imagery) and an X-band SAR which collected VV
data.  The resolution of this system ranged between 10 and 40 m, and it
collected image swaths between 15 and 90 km wide.  The ground coverage of 
this
system was limited in order to image specific test sites during its two
missions.<p>
<p>
Three spaceborne SAR systems are planned for the future: ERS-2, RADARSAT, 
and
ASAR.  The ERS-2 SAR will be an exact duplicate of ERS-1, and is scheduled for
launch in early 1995.  The Canadian RADARSAT will consist of a C-band SAR 
with
HH-polarization and has a variety of modes for resolution/swath width.  The
SCANSAR mode can yield swath widths up to 500 km with a spatial resolution of
100 m.  This wide swath mode will allow imaging of the same geographic 
location
once every 2 to 3 days.  The ERS-2 follow-on, known as Advanced SAR or ASAR,
will be deployed on the planned European ENVISAT and consists of a
dual-polarized C-band SAR.  It will have both co-polarized channels (HH and
VV), but not cross-polarized (HV).  The planned "wide swath" mode has a 400-
km
swath width and 100-m resolution.<p>

<a name="RTFToC19">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
It is the consensus of the ecological working group that SAR data contain
unique information that can be exploited by the terrestrial science community
to study a wide range of physical, chemical and biological processes important
to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE), as well as the U.S. Global Change
Research Program (GCRP).  Over the past decade, NASA has taken the U.S. lead 
in
development of the technological as well as the scientific research
infrastructure related to airborne and spaceborne SAR systems.  NASA
initiatives in this area include: (1) development and operation of the JPL
AIRSAR system; (2) development and deployment (with the German and Italian
Space Agencies) of the SIR-C/X-SAR system; (3) establishment of the Alaska 
SAR
Facility to receive SAR data from satellite systems such as ERS-1, JERS-1 and
RADARSAT; and (4) sponsoring of extensive research programs to develop
techniques to use information derived from these systems to study a wide 
range
of oceanic and terrestrial processes.  The size of NASA's investment in this
area over the past decade has been significant.<p>
<p>
These NASA-sponsored programs, as well as parallel programs in other 
countries,
resulted in most of the research discussed in this paper.  Based on these
results, other U.S. government agencies are now beginning to recognize the
utility of SAR data for monitoring terrestrial surfaces and processes, and are
initiating research and development programs to exploit existing or future 
SAR
systems.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency is sponsoring
programs which will utilize SAR data as one component of a system to map and
monitor variations in forest and vegetation cover in order to derive better
estimates of the global terrestrial carbon budget.  In another program, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sponsored research to develop techniques to
monitor tidal periods and vegetation cover in coastal estuaries.<p>
<p>
It is the consensus of the ecology working group that the full utility of SAR
for ecological applications is now only emerging and that this potential will
not be fully realized within the MTPE and U.S. GCRP without a well-focused SAR
R&amp;D program within NASA.  Fully exploiting the potential of imaging 
radars
systems requires careful consideration of a number of sometimes conflicting
factors, including:<p>
<p>
(1)	The need to conduct additional remote sensing science studies to 
understand
the source of  the different types of signatures present in radar imagery.
This is particularly true in the multi-temporal data sets now being collected
by existing satellite systems such as ERS-1 and JERS-1.<p>
<p>
(2)	Based on the results of recent studies using existing satellite SAR 
systems
as well as recently collected SIR-C/X-SAR data, the need to conduct efforts to
develop and validate algorithms which use radar data to estimate specific
surface characteristics.<p>
<p>
(3)	The need to continue to develop new approaches to exploit the spatial 
and
temporal information derived from radar imagery in ecosystem and process
studies.<p>
<p>
(4)	The need to exploit the full breadth of the SIR-C/X-SAR data sets beyond
the ~50 experiments presently being conducted.  This need includes not only
providing existing experiments with adequate resources to conclude their 
work,
but also identification of additional research which could be carried out using
this unique data set.  We have not identified a compelling reason for a third
flight that is an exact repeat of the first two flights,  especially in light
of the scale of effort required to analyze the existing data set and the fact
that it is unlikely that sufficient resources will be provided to analyze these
additional data.<p>
<p>
(5)	The need to develop and implement a coherent research plan within 
NASA's
Mission to Planet Earth to fully exploit the SAR data sets being provided by
existing and planned<p>
	international SAR missions.<p>
<p>
(6)	To fully exploit the potential of SAR to meet the objectives of Mission to
Planet Earth in the area of terrestrial ecosystem science, there is a need to
develop a multi-frequency (with a minimum of two frequencies, C- and L-
bands),
polarimetric SAR system.  In the development of such a system, the tradeoffs
between resolution, swath width, and sampling frequency in terms of 
scientific
requirements versus cost considerations must carefully be considered.  
However,
if the cost of obtaining a multi-frequency, polarimetric spaceborne SAR is a
reduction of spatial resolution, such a lower- resolution system would be quite
suitable for many ecological applications.<p>
<p>
The above needs, in essence, are the primary recommendations of the ecology
working group.  The working group realizes that it would be very difficult to
encompass these recommendations in the context of existing programs within
NASA, and that they are unlikely to be implemented unless a new program is
started.  Thus, we make the following summary recommendations:<p>
<p>
(1)	NASA should consider development of a new satellite remote sensing 
system
which would contain a multi-frequency, polarimetric SAR.<p>
<p>
(2)	Even without the development of an advanced SAR system by NASA, the
existing SAR data sets as well as those which will be collected by satellite
SAR systems in the future do provide unique information for a variety of
ecological processes.  NASA should take a more proactive role in ensuring that
these data are used in an effective manner within its Mission to Planet
Earth.<p>
<p>
(3)	To achieve recommendation 2, NASA should create a multi-disciplinary 
SAR
Facility Instrument Team.  In addition to carrying out the recommendations
outlined above, this team would also serve as the advisory board for
development of the new SAR satellite system recommended above.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC21">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
The cryosphere is a major component of the hydrosphere and interacts
significantly with the global climate system, the geosphere, and the 
biosphere.
Over 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is covered seasonally by snow, and
about 10 percent is covered permanently with snow or ice.<p>
<p>
Snow and ice play important interactive roles in regional climates, because
snow has a higher albedo than any other natural surface. The earliest signs of
global climate change are likely in the polar regions and in the seasonal snow
cover and alpine glaciers. For investigations in hydrology and land-surface
climatology, seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are critical to the
radiation and water balances. Over major portions of the middle and high
latitudes, and at high elevations in the tropical latitudes, snow and alpine
glaciers are the largest contributors to runoff in rivers and to ground-water
recharge. The dual problems of estimating both the quantity of water held by
seasonal snow packs and timing of snowmelt confront snow hydrologists.
Understanding the processes in the seasonal snow cover is also important for
studies of the chemical balance of alpine drainage basins, because of
translocation of anions and cations within the snow pack and possible
concentrated release in the first phases of the melt season.<p>
<p>
Soil moisture is an environmental descriptor that integrates much of the land
surface hydrology and is the interface for interaction between the solid Earth
surface and life.  As central as this seems to man's existence and
biogeochemical cycles, it is a descriptor that has not had wide spread
application as a variable in any land process models.  There are two primary
reasons for this.  It is a difficult variable to measure, not at one point in
time, but in a consistent and spatially comprehensive basis.  Also, it exhibits
very large spatial and temporal variability; thus point measurements have had
very little meaning.  The practical result of this is that soil moisture has
not been used as measurable variable in any of our current hydrologic,
climatic, agricultural, or biogeochemical models.<p>
<p>
Both passive microwave and active microwave (SAR) techniques have 
provided
solid theoretical and experimental results that the top five cm of soil
moisture can be measured from aircraft and space platforms under a variety of
environmental conditions and through a moderate vegetation cover (<a
href="fig3.1.gif">Figures 3-1</a>, <a
href="fig3.2.gif">3-2</a>).  This section will define the science
issues and application opportunities that can be addressed by microwave 
remote
sensing of soil moisture and snow water equivalence, describe the capabilities
and limitations of the passive and SAR systems, describe the progress to date
and document the research still needed to take this technology to an
operational status.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC22">BACKGROUND</a><p>
<p>
The scientific objectives related to snow and ice identified by the National
Research Council are:<p>
<p>
*	To study the global hydrologic cycle to determine the distributions,
dimensions, properties, and relevant dynamics of snow, sea and lake ice, ice
sheets and shelves.<p>
<p>
*	To determine and understand the mechanisms for the transfers of water 
between
the major global reservoirs (glacier flow, melting, and freezing).<p>
<p>
*	To predict on appropriate time scales the distributions, volumes, and 
fluxes
associated with snow cover, sea ice, ice sheets and shelves, ground ice, and
permafrost.<p>
<p>
Although snow and ice phenomena play important roles in global processes,
difficult access hampers data collection, and conventional studies of snow and
ice cannot address the correct scales of most phenomena. In situ sampling
methods have limited utility for capturing the spatial and temporal variability
of snow and  ice processes.  Operational hydrology and climatology require
timely measurement of snow-pack parameters.<p>
<p>
The redistribution of solar energy over the globe is central to studies in
climate.  Water serves a fundamental role in this redistribution through the
energy associated with evapotranspiration, the transport of atmospheric water
vapor, and precipitation.  Residence time for atmospheric water is on the order
of a week, and for soil moisture, from a couple of days to months, which
emphasize the active nature of the hydrologic cycle.  Understanding the
importance of the land-surface hydrology to climate has  emerged as an
important research area since the mid 1960s when researchers  at the
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory placed a land hydrology component 
into
their general circulation model (GCM) (see Manabe et al., 1965; Manabe,
1969).<p>
<p>
As the sophistication of GCMs has increased, the role of the land  surface
component has become more and more important.  However, a major  weakness 
in
the current GCMs is, according to the CES-89 report, "the  adequate
parameterization of variables representing the terrestrial phase of the
hydrologic cycle..., which is primarily the result of totally inadequate
information concerning the degree of spatial variability of  precipitation,
evapotranspiration, and other components of hydrology."  This report goes
further to say "the lack of regional-scale measurements  introduces a severe
shortcoming in the testing of GCM output." <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important role that the land surface component of  a GCM
performs is the partitioning of incoming radiative energy into  sensible and
latent heat fluxes.  The major factor involved in determining  the relative
proportions of the two heat fluxes is the availability of  water, generally in
the form of soil moisture.  A number of  modeling studies have demonstrated 
the
sensitivity of soil moisture  anomalies to climate (Walker and Rowntree, 1977,
Rowntree and Bolton, 1983,  Rind, 1982, Shukla and Mintz, 1982, Delworth and
Manabe, 1989).   Researchers have reported, for instance, that soil moisture is
the  second most important forcing function, second only to the sea surface
temperature in the mid latitudes, and it becomes the most important forcing
function in the summer months.  <p>
<p>
The role of soil moisture is equally important at smaller scales. Recent
studies with mesoscale atmospheric models have similarly demonstrated a
sensitivity to spatial gradients of soil moisture.  For example, Fast and
McCorcle (1991) have shown that soil moisture gradients can induce thermally
induced circulations similar to sea breezes.  Chang and Wetzel (1991) have
concluded that the spatial variations of vegetation and soil moisture affect
the surface baroclinic structures through differential heating, which in turn
indicate the location and intensity of surface dynamic and thermodynamic
discontinuities necessary to develop severe storms.  In yet another study,
Lanicci et al., (1987) have shown that dry soil conditions over northern Mexico
and variable soil moisture conditions over the southern Great Plains can
dynamically interact to alter prestorm conditions and subsequent convective
rainfall patterns.<p>
<p>
It is still unclear whether the spatial distribution of soil moisture collected
at regional scales is useful for GCM and mesoscale modeling.  One indication in
favor is the recent study by Betts et al.,  (1994) showing that initialization
of ECMWF weather predictions on current soil moisture (during the summer of
1993 in the US Great Plains region) can lead to improved rainfall predictions.
The extreme wetness conditions, in comparison to climatological average soil
moisture, clearly was a factor in the effect.  For more normal conditions, soil
moisture anomalies will vary with the spatial and temporal scales of rain
events--scales that may be meaningful to 4-dimensional data assimilations
(4DDA) and mesoscale modeling.<p>
<p>
Based on these studies and scales ranging from GCM to mesoscale, it appears
that soil moisture will be an important hydrologic variable for
hydrometeorological modeling and validation studies.  Because of the 
ubiquitous
nature of soil moisture in many disciplines, there are numerous potential
science applications for frequent and spatially comprehensive measurements 
of
soil moisture.  However, most of these will fit under the umbrella of the
following four science issues which are the highest priority:<p>
<p>
*	To understand the role of surface soil moisture in the partitioning of
incoming radiant energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes at a variety of
scales from mesoscale to GCM scale.<p>
<p>
*	To understand the relationship between the surface 5 cm of soil 
moisture
observable by microwave techniques and the total profile (1 m or  more) soil
moisture that is accessible to plants and transpiration to the atmosphere.<p>
<p>
*	To understand how spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture are 
related
to the physical and hydrologic properties of soils.<p>
<p>
*	To understand how the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture 
can be
used to improve our ability to model runoff at a variety of scales and adapt
hydrologic models to areas of differing climate, biomes and soils, and
geology.<p>
<p>
With the potential for measuring soil moisture having been demonstrated, the
obvious question to ask is how might society use such soil moisture
measurements?  As in the science issues, there are four general areas in 
which
routine measurements of soil moisture could have major impacts on our
day-to-day lives:<p>
<p>
*	Improvements in medium range weather forecasting by incorporating 
measured
soil moisture on a 30-km grid on a daily basis.<p>
<p>
*	Agricultural applications would include on-farm uses for improving 
irrigation
scheduling and efficiencies, to improving crop yield modeling for both 
domestic
and foreign areas.  The scales of interest here would be 100 m to 1 km and
three to seven days.<p>
<p>
*	Water management applications require better quantification of water 
uses,
storages and runoff to monitor existing resources and to assist decision makers
in allocation of limited resources or coordination of relief efforts in times
of flooding.  The scales of interest here would also be 100 m to 1 km and three
to seven days.<p>
<p>
*	Climate models, particularly for annual and inter annual variability, 
need to
be able to represent the land surface hydrologic processes accurately.
Measured soil moisture can be used as a state variable and as a validity
measure for GCMs.  The scales of interest here are 1 to 10 km and 7 to 30
days.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">ROLE
OF SAR
</a><p>
<p>
Satellite remote sensing has become increasingly important to hydrologists 
and
climatologists because the data provide information on the spatial and 
temporal
distributions of parameters of climatic and hydrologic importance: snow 
covered
area, surface albedo, snow water equivalence, and snow wetness (liquid water
content). For the seasonal snow cover, remote sensing improves the 
monitoring
of existing conditions and has been incorporated into several
runoff-forecasting and management systems. Visible and near-infrared 
sensors
have been used extensively to measure snow-covered area. While the signal in
this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is sensitive to snow grain size
and impurities, it is not sensitive to wetness and is sensitive to water
equivalence only for shallow snow packs. In addition, cloud cover hampers 
data
collection from these sensors, so the opportunities for obtaining suitable data
can be infrequent. In addition to accurate measurements of snow extent and
albedo, forecasting of melt (at both continental and drainage-basin scales)
requires information about spatial and temporal distributions of snow water
equivalence and free liquid-water content.<p>
<p>
Passive microwave signals are sensitive to snow properties of hydrologic
interest. However, the spatial resolution of spaceborne passive microwave
sensors is much coarser than the natural scale of variation in mountainous
areas. Active microwave remote sensing has long promised the advantages of: 
(1)
all-weather day or night imaging capabilities; (2) high resolution suitable for
alpine regions; (3) sensitivity to most snow properties of interest to snow
hydrologists and climatologists. Over the last decade, major improvements in
technology from data acquisition and processing to quantitative interpretation
have put capabilities for advanced snow and ice measurements at our 
doorstep.<p>
<p>
For snow, recent studies (using SIR-C/X-SAR, AIRSAR, and ERS-1 data) have 
shown
a significant improvement in understanding and modeling the backscattering 
and
polarization properties as a function of snow-pack parameters. An accurate
algorithm to retrieve snow wetness, which indicates where and at what rate 
snow
is melting, has been developed and tested using C-band SIR C and JPL AIRSAR
data (<a href="fig3.3a.gif">Figures 3-3a</a>, <a
href="fig3.3b.gif">3-3b</a>). Thus, accurate information about the
spatial and temporal distributions and melting status of snow cover can be
provided for hydrological and climatic investigations and operations. Maps of
snow-covered area derived from SIR-C/X-SAR and AIRSAR now compare 
reasonably
well (85-90% accuracy) with those derived from visible imagery, which 
require
clear weather and daylight.<p>
<p>
For soil moisture, recent advances in remote sensing technology have
demonstrated that soil moisture can be measured by a variety of techniques.
However, only microwave technology has the ability to quantitatively measure
soil moisture under a variety of topographic and vegetation cover conditions,
so potentially it could be extended to routine measurements from a satellite
system. A number of experiments using sensors mounted in trucks, aircraft, 
and
spacecraft have shown that the moisture within a thin layer of soil, on the
order of 5 cm,  can be accurately measured for bare soil and thinly vegetated
surfaces.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC24">Soil
Moisture Remote Sensing
</a><p>
<p>
There are two basic microwave approaches that are typically used to measure
soil moisture.  One is passive (which is based on radiometry) and the other is
active and uses radar. Both approaches utilize the large contrast between the
dielectric constant of dry soil and water. At L-band, the dielectric constant
can vary from about 3 for dry soil to about 20 for wet soil, which can result
in a change in emissivity for passive systems from about 0.95 to 0.6 or lower
and an increase in the radar backscatter approaching 10 dB. There are also
major differences between the two systems in spatial resolution, swath width,
data rate, and power requirements. However, almost without exception, the two
systems are complementary; that<p>
is, strengths in one are matched by weaknesses in the other, and vice versa.
The advantages of passive microwave systems include frequent coverage, low 
data
rates, and (relative to active microwave) simpler data processing. The
disadvantages include poor resolution. In the case of the active microwave
systems, the advantages include high resolution, but this comes at the expense
of higher data rates and more complex processing.<p>
<p>
Measurements show that the estimated soil moisture for L-band frequencies
correlate best with soil moistures in the top 5 cm of the soil. The sensitivity
of active microwave sensors to soil moisture was demonstrated with many 
ground,
airborne, and even some spaceborne experiments ( Ulaby and Batlivala, 1976;
Ulaby, et al., 1978; Chang et al., 1980; Jackson et al., 1981; Wang et al.,
1986; Dobson and Ulaby, 1986; Lin et al., 1994a, b). Even though these
experiments have documented the sensitivity of the radar signal to soil
moisture, algorithms to invert radar measurements to infer soil moisture (Oh 
et
al., 1992; Dubois et al., 1994) must still be further evaluated over a broader
range of conditions.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC25">Difficulties
in Soil Moisture Remote Sensing
</a><p>
<p>
A significant difficulty in remotely sensing soil moisture, either with active
and passive systems,  is the effect of target characteristics other than the
soil moisture; for example surface roughness, vegetation, and topography.  The
two most important target properties are surface roughness and those related 
to
the vegetation canopy.  Applying a backscattering model, Lin et al., (1994)
have studied the sensitivity of radar signals to various land surface
parameters; specifically for L-band (1.25 GHz)  over a short grass canopy they
found that the most important parameter appears to be the surface roughness.
In most natural settings, the effect of roughness may be equal or greater than
the effect of soil moisture on the radar backscatter.  Thus, the soil moisture
problem becomes one of determining the roughness effect independently so 
that a
model can be inverted to yield a soil moisture estimate.<p>
<p>
Surface Roughness Effects:  Improved understanding of surface scattering
processes is needed to further our understanding of the role of surface
roughness in soil moisture estimation.  Thus, theoretical surface
backscattering models have been developed for this purpose; namely, the 
small
perturbation model (SPM), the physical optics model (POM) and<p>
geometrical optics model (GOM).  In a broad sense, the geometrical optics model
is best suited for very rough surface, the physical optics model is suitable
for surfaces with intermediate scales of roughness, and the small perturbation
model is suitable for smooth surfaces.  In general, these models have not
provided good predictive values in field-scale observed soil moisture, and more
research is needed into surface scattering models.  Examples of recent work 
are
Fung et al. (1992) and Oh et al. (1992).<p>
<p>
The approach adopted by Oh et al. (1992) is based on scattering behavior in
limiting cases and on experimental data.  They have developed an empirical
model in terms of the root mean square (rms) roughness height, the wave 
number,
and the relative dielectric constant.  By using this model with multipolarized
radar data, the soil moisture content and the surface roughness can be
determined.  The key to this approach is that the co-polarization ratios
(HH/VV) and cross-polarization ratios (HV/VV) which are given explicitly in
terms of the roughness and the soil dielectric constant.  In more recent work
(Dubois et al., 1995), an algorithm was derived that uses L-band HH and VV
radar cross sections only to estimate surface roughness and soil moisture. In
this case, the algorithm was tested with both airborne and spaceborne SAR 
data
and accuracies of 3-4% absolute was found for surfaces with vegetation that 
has
a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) < 0.4.  Thus, initial
results look promising when applied to bare soil and sparse vegetation.  But,
current SAR satellite sensors (ERS-1/2 and RADARSAT) are both
single-polarization instruments (C-VV and C-HH, respectively), and even when
used together cannot provide cross-polarization ratios.<p>
<p>
<p>
Vegetation Effects:  The effect of vegetation is to attenuate the microwave
emission from the soil; it also adds to the total radiative flux with its own
emission. The degree to which vegetation affects the determination of soil
moisture depends upon the wavelength, the mass and water content of 
vegetation,
and the vegetation's structural characteristics as it influences its scattering
properties.   Thus, with radar the effect of the vegetation canopy adds more
complexity to the problem.  To infer soil moisture, one must determine the soil
roughness effects and  the effects of the vegetation canopy, which is a 
complex
inference problem and may not be unique without high temporal resolution 
data
in which only soil moisture is changing.   As with the roughness case, the
effect of vegetation on the active microwave sensing of soil moisture is
greatly dependent upon the instrument incidence angle, frequency, and
polarization. The vegetation contains water along and has plant structure.
Radar backscatter is sensitive to both of these characteristics (Lin et al.,
1994a).   Therefore, the radar backscatter from a vegetated surface will have
the integrated effect of the vegetation and underlying soil.<p>
<p>
Two general approaches have been used to model the volume scattering, the 
wave
approach and the intensity (or radiative transfer) approach. Both approaches
have their constraints, especially in dealing with complex vegetation
structures. Several groups are involved in research in the area of estimating
soil moisture from active microwave data in the presence of vegetation. Few
results have been presented or published, however. Saatchi et al. (1994) 
showed
that by using C-band and L-band data, the canopy water content of grasses in
the Konza Prairie could be estimated with an accuracy of about 20%, while Lin
et al. (1994) reported an accuracy of about 6% when estimating soil moisture
over grass covered areas in<p>
England.<p>
<p>
Assuming that the effects of vegetation could be accounted for in the case of
active microwave sensors, and given the fact that the best resolution than
could be expected from a spaceborne low frequency radiometer is on the order 
of
tens of kilometers, it is clear that SAR can play an important role in
providing remotely sensed surface soil moisture maps. The optimum radar
parameters based on the demonstrated algorithms would be a  polarimetric L-
band
radar system with a resolution on the order of 100 m. There is evidence that
suggests that inferring soil moisture in vegetated areas would require some
higher frequency SAR data, either C-band or X-band.  Continued research is
needed to help resolve the effectiveness of radar data for soil moisture under
different vegetation types and densities.  One approach is using multi-
temporal
data from a satellite platform, which may provide the long term data sets
necessary to isolate the fast-changing soil moisture effects from the slowly
changing vegetation and roughness effects.  Another promising approach is
combining the SAR radar measurements with a distributed hydrologic models 
to
infer soil moisture (for example Lin et al., 1994b).<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC26">Field
Measurements of Soil Moisture
</a><p>
<p>
When deciding the usefulness of the remote sensing instruments and the 
inferred
soil moisture estimates, one has to take into account the natural spatial
variability of soil moisture. Thus, when estimating the accuracy of a
technique, estimated and in situ measured values are typically compared. In
this way, areal averages from the remotely sensed data are compared to point
measurements, and the natural variation in the measured quantity becomes a 
very
important factor in judging the performance of a given technique.<p>
<p>
In most countries, there are a number of in-situ soil moisture measurements
taken in support of operational activities related to agriculture. Two examples
of such measurements programs are the Illinois State (U.S.) Soil Moisture
Program, an 18-site measurement network in operation since 1981; and the 
long
term soil moisture measurements in the former Soviet Union and reported by
Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991). Typically these measurements are taken 
using a
neutron probe, Time Domain Reflectivity (TD) instrument, or through
labor-intensive techniques such as gravimetric measurements. Also, typically
these are made on a three-day, weekly, or longer basis and in some cases (for
agricultural experiments) only during the growing season. For example the
current Illinois network makes biweekly samples during the growing season 
and
monthly samples at other times; the data reported by Vinnikov and 
Yeserkepova
(1991) were sampled at a monthly time interval.<p>
<p>
The in-situ measurements generally provide good definition with depth, 
usually
consisting of measurements every 5 or 10 cm throughout the root zone to 
depths
of one to two meters. Thus, the profile is well defined but there is usually
not an extensive spatial sampling to detect soil moisture gradients in the
horizontal plane. A number of investigators have looked into the spatial
variability of soil properties.  Rogowski (1972) found that over a range of
soils that the coefficient of variation in the distribution of water content at
15 bars was in the range of 15 to 35%; and for experimental hydraulic
conductivity was 5 to 68%. Hawley et al., (1982) investigated the effect of
sample volume on estimated soil moisture content. Using a 2m square plot and 
10
samples, the estimated CV was in the range of 5% for the three different soil
moisture conditions investigated; implying a CV of 15-20% for a single sample,
which is consistent with the other similar studies. In addition, they concluded
that samples greater than 200g (50 cc) are needed for accurate estimates.<p>
<p>
Field scale variability (16 ha, > 40 acres) was evaluated by Bell et al.,
(1980) using data collected in 57 fields in Arizona, Kansas, and South Dakota.
The nominal standard deviation of all the data analyzed was between 2 and 3%,
soil moisture. For remote sensing studies, this means that perfect correlations
to ground observations are unlikely and that the inherent error due to
field-scale variability is of the same order of magnitude as the demonstrated
accuracies of the inversion results for both active and passive microwave
instruments.<p>
<p>
While there are direct uses for the surface soil moistures, a much wider range
of research and applications would benefit from an estimate of the profile soil
moisture. Although there is still much work to be done in this area, some basic
concepts have been proven. Kostov and Jackson (Kostov, 1993) have identified
four general approaches: statistical, knowledge-based (a priori information),
radiometric inversion, and soil water modeling. Regional profile mapping 
using
a straightforward regression approach was demonstrated in Jackson et al.,
(1987). Knowledge-based approaches have been used extensively by Reutov 
and
Shutko (1986 and 1990) and also by Jackson (1980). Recent research has 
focused
on a combination of the inversion and modeling approaches (Entekhabi et al.,
1994). Each of these approaches needs to be considered in the development of
large scale mapping programs because any one in particular may not be
compatible due to limitations caused by ancillary data requirements or the
temporal and spatial sampling.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC27">Radar
Observations for Soil Moisture
</a><p>
<p>
SAR satellites offer perhaps the best opportunity to measure soil moisture
routinely at regional scales.  Currently, the ERS-1 C-band (VV) and JERS-1
L-band SARs are operating, and the Canadian RADARSAT,  also C-band (HH), 
will
be launched in mid-1995.  Although it is believed that an L-band polarimetric
system would be optimal for soil moisture, the preliminary results from the
ERS-1 demonstrate its capability as a soil moisture instrument under ideal
conditions: bare soil, near saturation, constant roughness.  The main drawback
to the SAR systems is the lack of existing algorithms for the routine
determination of soil moisture.  However, through airborne and SIR-C remote
sensing experiments, field observations are accumulating for a diverse set of
sites.  It is hoped that these data are sufficient for developing suitable
algorithms.  It is critical that these diverse data sets be brought together in
a SAR soil moisture data base.<p>
<p>
Experimental data sets can be grouped into three classes, of which only one is
discussed in this report.  These classes are: (i) In-situ operational soil
moisture data sets, taken by water resources and agricultural agencies for a
variety of reasons.  Even though these data sets are important for hydrological
research, the lack of simultaneous remote sensing data make these soil 
moisture
measurements of limited value for the development of soil moisture remote
sensing algorithms. (ii) Remote sensing experiments with passive microwave
sensors.  Examples of these include HAPEX-MOBILHY (Hydrologic Atmospheric 
Pilot
Experiment and Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique) program in southern France 
in
1985; HAPEX-SAHEL in Niger (West Africa) in 1992; and the First ISLSCP Field
Experiment (FIFE) in Kansas in 1987.  (iii) Remote sensing experiments with 
SAR
and in some cases passive microwave sensors.  These experiments include:<p>
<p>
Mac-Hydro-90 in the Mahantango catchment (central Pennsylvania) in 1990 
which
was a multi-sensor  campaign (using the DC-8 with the three frequency
polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ,and the C-130 carrying  the 
PBMR
L-band radiometer and the NS001 thematic mapper simulator.<p>
<p>
Washita-92, conducted over the Little Washita catchment in Oklahoma in 1992,
was another multi-sensor  campaign (using the DC-8 with the three frequency
polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and the C-130 carrying the 
NS001
thematic mapper simulator, the Thermal Imaging Mapper, the Electronically
Steered Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR), a 37-GHz radiometer, and a USDA 
laser
profiler.)<p>
<p>
Mac-Europe-91, a multi-aircraft campaign DC-8 and EU-2 for remote sensing in
Europe during 1991.  Soil moisture data were collected at a number of sites
including Slapton Wood, Devon, England; Montespertoli, Tuscony, Italy; EFEDA
experiment in Spain.<p>
<p>
Shuttle Imaging Radar, SIR-C, flights in April and October 1994.  There were a
number of sites for which radar data were collected for soil moisture studies.
These sites included the Little Washita (OK, USA), Mahantango catchment (PA,
USA), Alcona (Manitoba, Canada), Zwalm catchment (Belgium), and 
Montespertoli
(Italy).<p>
<p>
It is critical that these data be made available to provide algorithm
developers a broader range of soil moisture data.<p>

<a name="RTFToC28">CURRENT
AND PLANNED SAR ASSETS AND THEIR USE
</a><p>
<p>
Several methods for mapping melting snow-covered regions have been  
developed
and tested using AIRSAR and ERS-1 imagery. Mapping wet snow and glaciers 
in
remote alpine regions using a conventional single-pass, single-polarization 
SAR
imagery requires an accurate Digital Elevation Model (DEM), but analysis of
time-series ERS-1 data sets showed significant improvement in mapping 
accuracy
and corresponding decrease in the need for a DEM. However, the capability of 
a
single-polarization SAR to study alpine snow is limited to map wet snow cover
only.  Furthermore, multi-frequency, multi-polarization SAR can effectively 
map
the extent of wet-snow regions without requiring any topographic 
information.
Numerical simulations show that a similar technique could map dry snow 
cover;
verification is ongoing. Thus, a multi-frequency, polarized SAR provides snow
mapping capability from small to large scales.  SIR-C/X-SAR also can map firn
regions, which indicates the regions of annual snow accumulation or of 
glacier
growth. This capability provides an important tool for mass-balance studies of
glaciers.<p>
<p>
The most fundamental snow cover property, in terms of water supply 
forecasting,
is the snow-water equivalence: the total amount of water the snow would yield
at a  point if it melted. This variable has been traditionally measured at
several hundred snow courses throughout the mountainous regions of the 
western
U.S. How to extrapolate these widely dispersed measurements remains a
fundamental problem in estimating the total water volume in the mountains.
Numerical simulations with multi-frequency, dual-polarization SAR have 
shown it
can monitor the spatial and temporal distributions of snow-water equivalence.
Data analysis with SIR-C/X-SAR is ongoing. With accurate estimates of
snow-covered area, detection of melting snow, and the measurement of the
spatial distribution of snow water equivalence, we will better understand the
most fundamental problems in snow hydrology: the spatial and temporal
distributions of snow properties in alpine regions.<p>
<p>
To derive the maximum benefit in terms of research or application out of
remotely sensed soil moisture, the remote sensing data must be integrated into
a geographic information system and analyzed taking into account the soil
properties and land characteristics.  Therefore, the required resolution of the
remotely sensed soil moisture data is related to the intended usage and the
ancillary data bases available for interpretation.  It makes little sense to
collect data globally at a resolution much higher than that of the ancillary
data.  It therefore appears that based on the range of projected applications
and the available ancillary data bases that a spatial resolution on the order
of 100 m to 200 m may be advantageous for processing and interpretation.  It is
true that the detail offered in higher resolution SAR data is interesting,
however, it does not seem to be really needed except for mapping and other 
less
time critical analyses.<p>
<p>
The timing and frequency of observation are very important in the valuation 
of
the remote sensing data for application and analysis.  Surface soil moisture is
diurnal in nature, generally decreasing during the day and rising slightly at
night (in the absence of precipitation).  The time of the observation will most
certainly be considered in its use.  Certain times of the day may offer certain
advantages.  For instance, to extrapolate a surface observation to the profile
using a physically based approach, Jackson (1980) has shown that a predawn
observation is advantageous.  In fact, late afternoon observations of surface
soil moisture using shorter wavelengths may provide little to no information.
An improvement in this single observation could be made by utilizing diurnal
changes, an a.m. and a p.m. observation.  For bare soils this could provide a
good estimate of the total surface flux during the day. Frequency of coverage
is a much more difficult subject.  Of course, this too is dependent on the
application.  It seems that daily coverage would be of greatest value for all
regions.  There is a significant sacrifice in increasing this, however, the
next plateau would be three days.  Observations at lower frequencies might 
only
be of selected value. <p>
<p>
Given this sampling requirement and the previous experimental results, it is
clear that the currently planned international SARs can provide little beyond
change detection for changing moisture conditions and mapping of wet alpine
snow cover only.  <p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC29">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
The recent results indicating that soil moisture and snow water equivalence
could indeed be measured accurately with spaceborne multiparameter SARs 
bring
the remote sensing one step closer to providing some important variables to
help understand and routinely monitor the hydrologic cycle.  However, even
though the status of SAR for measuring these quantities is very promising, it
is recognized that there are a number of logical steps to be taken in order for
the general scientific and public communities to benefit from this research. 
<p>
<p>
Given the previous experimental results, and the recent algorithms derived to
infer soil moisture and snow water equivalence, it is clear that single
frequency SARs can provide little beyond change detection for changing 
moisture
conditions.  It is highly doubtful whether even the magnitude of the change 
in
the soil moisture could be quantified from these types of single parameter SAR
measurements without a significant number of risky assumptions.  Therefore, 
the
logical conclusion is that the ultimate goal should certainly be an operational
spaceborne multiparameter SAR for routine soil moisture and snow water
equivalence mapping.  Recognizing that this is not likely to happen soon, we
therefore urge the continued support of the NASA multiparameter airborne 
SAR
program as a vehicle to continue the development and validation of soil
moisture, snow wetness, and snow water equivalence algorithms in the short 
term
with the long term goal the definition and launch of an operational SAR to
monitor these important variables of the hydrologic cycle.  Below we outline a
few steps we consider necessary to achieve this goal:<p>
<p>
(1)	Combine all data collected during AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR campaigns 
and
analyze their ability to determine soil moisture empirically (sigma 0 vs.
measured soil moisture) and using all available algorithms.  Develop statistics
to define how large the errors are, what type of errors, and what conditions
the analysis or algorithms work or do not work well.  Using both US and 
foreign
campaigns should provide data from more than twenty sites and numerous
conditions.<p>
<p>
(2)	Continue a vigorous research program to extend current algorithms to 
infer
soil moisture from vegetated surfaces and to refine the snow water 
equivalence
algorithms.  The emphasis should be on well coordinated campaigns involving
both active and passive microwave instruments over a variety of different
terrain types.<p>
<p>
(3)	Examine the relationship between surface measurements and profile
measurements of soil moisture to evaluate the severity of the problem, if it
exists.  Data exist to address the following question:  How well can the
profile moisture be modeled if the surface 5 cm of soil moisture can be
measured every 3 days at a precision of <u>+</u>4% by volume?  What are the
performances of various models including simple regression models?<p>
<p>
(4)	Encourage land process modelers (mesoscale, GCM and runoff) to 
attempt to
use measured soil moisture and snow water equivalence from SIR-C/X and 
AIRSAR
campaigns in their modeling.<p>

<a name="RTFToC31">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
Synthetic aperture radar images of the ocean surface very often reveal a
remarkable range of signatures inscribed on the uppermost layers of the sea.
These telltale variations in surface roughness can be interpreted in terms of
geophysical and geochemical processes occurring on or near the surface of 
the
sea.  When used collectively with (a) adequate theories of radar surface
scattering, and (b) an understanding of the underlying hydrospheric,
atmospheric or cryospheric dynamics, these images offer unparalleled and 
indeed
otherwise unattainable quantitative data on the marine environment, data that
are relevant to important questions in Earth science and marine operations.<p>
<p>
This chapter presents a summary of scientific achievements in ocean and ice
research, and lays out the potential for further advances based on research to
date.  It develops a rationale for a vigorous, continuing program that is
firmly grounded in past achievements and in new, interesting, and relevant
developments in SAR technology, hydrodynamics and scattering theory.  The
chapter develops the scientific basis for an ongoing NASA SAR program 
during
the next decade, and sets forth a prioritized sequence of space flights with
advanced instruments, along with a program of supporting research utilizing
data from space-based and aircraft-based SARs. The program keeps 
governmental
agency requirements for space-based data firmly in view.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC32">BACKGROUND</a><p>
<p>
Synthetic aperture radar was first flown on Seasat; launched in 1978, it
carried among other sensors an L-band SAR that yielded stunning day/night,
all-weather views of the Earth, its oceans and its ice cover.  This mission set
into motion a number of follow-on spaceflight programs by the former USSR, 
the
European Space Agency, Japan, and Canada, as well as secondary efforts in
airborne SAR by several other nations; in addition, the US has flown short,
widely spaced flights of Shuttle Imaging Radars A, B, and C in addition to
airborne systems.<p>
<p>
These data have resulted in a series of quantitative scientific findings and
theoretical advances in upper-ocean and lower atmosphere dynamics and in 
polar
ice studies.  Many papers have been published in the scientific and 
engineering
literature, references to the most seminal of which are cited here as examples
of the progress.  New findings that derive from the ongoing space-based SARs
continue to be reported, especially from ERS-1, which provides unparalleled
global, continuing data coverage.<p>
<p>
The strong view of the scientific community working on these problems is 
that
current single-channel, space-based SARs are yielding only a fraction of the
information available from more advanced multifrequency, multipolarization, 
and
multi-aperture configurations.  Fascinating glimpses of this have been 
provided
by the SIR-C/X SAR, as well as from aircraft instruments, especially the 
AIRSAR
on the NASA DC-8.  An example of prime importance is the potential for
measuring ocean surface current velocities on scales ranging from
estuarine/coastal to the ocean basins, using the along-track interferometric
mode of SAR - the ATISAR.  Such a capability would represent a revolutionary
advance in the understanding of ocean dynamics, and would provide the 
missing
dimension to large-scale currents derived from radar altimeter 
measurements.<p>
<p>
If properly enhanced capabilities can be realized in a spaced-based
configuration, the data on wind stress, current velocities, mesoscale current
distributions, sea-ice thickness, air-sea interchange, and similar phenomena
entering into the coupled ocean/atmosphere/ice system will be extremely
valuable in meeting objectives of Mission to Planet Earth.  The data must be
blended with other space and surface-derived information and assimilated into
numerical models or used to understand physical and chemical processes that 
can
be parametrically incorporated into such models.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC33">Scientific
Objectives
</a><p>
<p>
A national SAR program for oceans and ice can be formulated considering the
concerns of present-day ocean and atmospheric science, the history of past
achievements in SAR ocean observations, the state of development of ocean
backscatter and hydrodynamic theory, and the recent instrument advances in 
SAR
engineering.  The prime objective of a SAR program for the ocean is the
determination of surface currents for information on mesoscale phenomena 
as
related to climate modeling, surfactant dispersal and transport, coastal
dynamics, marine biology, and lateral fluxes at the ice margin.  As will be
discussed below, this capability of surface-current determination is still the
subject of intense development and experimentation.  Secondary objectives for
SAR applications include improved surface fluxes of ice-covered seas,
determination of fine-scale wind fields (especially in the coastal regime),
surveillance of surface films and slicks, and monitoring of surface and
internal gravity waves.  In the operational community, SAR data over the
coastal ocean are additionally seen as a crucially needed tool in three general
areas: regulatory functions (compliance monitoring and enforcement); 
warning of
potential threats to life, environmental quality, property and commercial
operations; and post-event measurement of impact and responses.  The 
primary
applications include search and rescue, fisheries management, monitoring of
coastline and bathymetry changes, and ship detection and routing. In most of
these areas of science and operations, further development is called for prior
to the routine generation of data products.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC34">Observational
Results
</a><p>
<p>
In some senses, the fractal-like surface of the sea and its overlying cover of
ice are simple, especially in terms of topography, composition, and texture.
Because of this, it has been possible to arrive at a reasonable understanding
of several important oceanic processes, notably internal wave dynamics,
surfactant properties, and wave spectra, by using SAR imagery in conjunction
with in-situ data and theoretical hydrodynamics.  In many cases, considerable
success has been achieved; in others, provocative but incomplete results have
been obtained; more work is clearly called for.<p>
<p>
Beyond the microphysical level, however, SAR has made significant 
contributions
to the disciplines of open-sea and coastal oceanography, marine boundary 
layer
meteorology, and sea ice dynamics. The morphology of the patterns, together
with an understanding of backscatter variations, allow one to deduce
information on a wide range of oceanic and cryospheric phenomena.  For 
example,
extremely valuable data have been obtained on surface and internal waves,
fronts, eddies, variations in bottom topography/bathymetry, upwellings,
small-scale and mesoscale currents, rainfall variations, surface wind speed 
and
stress, atmospheric convection, sea ice motions, marginal ice-zone processes,
ice age, leads, polynyas, vessel wakes, surfactant/oil distributions, and a
variety of other processes that give rise to subtle variations in surface
roughness detectable by SAR.  There are consequent polarization, frequency, 
and
incidence angle sensitivities that must be considered in assessing the specific
oceanographic value of SAR data.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC35">Theoretical
Developments
</a><p>
<p>
Theoretical approaches to SAR interpretation use quantitative analysis from
electromagnetics, liquid-state physics, hydrodynamics, scattering from 
random
media, and signal processing to interpret the imagery as two-dimensional field
measurements, not simply as patterns on the surface of the sea or the ice.  A
few examples of theoretical developments will illustrate the advance of
oceanographic SAR technology beyond simple geographical image analysis. 
The
transmitted radar signal is characterized by its amplitude, frequency, phase,
polarization, and incidence angle, and the received signal will contain
information on the properties of the scattering target that are sensitive to
those quantities and their modulations or variations.  Initially, through the
stimulus of surface wave imaging, polarimetric radar scattering theory 
advanced
significantly; early views were that specular-point scatter governs at small
incidence angles, while Bragg scatter is the mechanism of scatter at larger
angles.  Now more complete (but yet not adequate) theories suggest a mixture 
of
both processes occurs.  Such studies, together with observational results,
suggest that SAR can observe changes in the ocean wave spectrum at the 
Bragg
wavelength as small as a few percent.  SAR imaging theory has thus helped to
clarify the virtues and shortcomings of SAR as a surface wave spectrum
analyzer.  Detailed studies have been performed of the SAR Doppler spectrum 
of
waves and the potential of along-track interferometry for measuring surface
currents.  In surface hydrodynamics, the influences of currents and their
gradients on the surface waves have been advanced, as have theories for 
surface
wave/wave interactions and surface wave/internal wave interactions.  Models 
of
nonlinear soliton dynamics have been applied to internal solitary waves in 
the
sea with good agreement obtained between theory and data from SAR images 
and
in-situ observations. In ice studies, the application of ice dynamics,
rheological theory, and models of multicomponent dielectrics to ice detection
and motion have aided the understanding of sea ice.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC36">ROLE
OF SAR
</a><p>
<p>
From the previous discussions, it is clear that SAR has significant capability
for observing ocean processes.  We will indicate the types of observations that
can be made by dividing the discussion along the lines of: Open Ocean, Coastal
Ocean and Marine Operations, Marine Boundary Layer Meteorology, and Polar
Oceans, together with added comments on Applications. Examples of SAR 
imagery
and analysis are presented to illustrate results; these images are only
representative and are not necessarily major developments in and by 
themselves.
The priorities of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth are implicitly assumed here,
for which issues of Global and Regional Change are paramount.  Many of these
relate directly to climate change, since the ocean is a major component of the
climate engine.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC37">Open
Ocean
</a><p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Surface Waves.</b> The open ocean process that has been best studied 
by
SAR are long surface waves, their spatial spectra, and their refraction
patterns (Pierson, 1965).  The SAR image fidelity depends on the altitude and
velocity of the platform.  A low-altitude spacecraft (300 km or less) such as
SIR-C/X-SAR allows direct computation of wave spectra, including those
traveling in the direction of spacecraft velocity (Beal et al., 1983; 1986).
At altitudes of typical polar-orbiters (such as ERS-1), sophisticated
corrections are needed.  Wave observations in the Southern Oceans from
SIR-C/X-SAR are shown in <a href="fig4.1.gif">Figure 4-1</a>, along
with a comparison of their speed and direction obtained from (a) an on-board
processor/spectrum analyzer, and (b) the US Navy's Wave Analysis Model 
(WAM)
(Monaldo and Beal, 1994).  Satisfactory agreement is obtained in most cases,
and the remaining differences are likely more due to forecast error than to 
SAR
errors.  Long-term observations of ocean wave spectra could allow studies of
exchange of momentum between atmosphere and ocean, especially during 
storm
conditions.  In addition, wave refraction by large-scale current systems such
as the Gulf Stream is readily observed in high-resolution images, and provides
estimates of the current speed under some conditions.  In the future, a
dedicated, low-drag, low-flying SAR could be implemented that would yield
valuable operational information on long-wave spectra to forecasting 
agencies.
Such a system is a candidate for a small spacecraft (MacArthur, 1987).<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>Mesoscale Currents.</b> At the scale of the internal Rossby radius of
deformation, 10-40 km, the ocean mesoscale, important interactions between 
the
planetary boundary layer, the ocean mixed layer and quasi-geostrophic 
oceanic
dynamics occur.  These interactions control meridional fluxes of heat, global
circulation, internal variations in ocean-atmosphere, and other critical
processes.  The boundaries of oceanic mesoscale systems are imaged by SAR as
discontinuities at the current boundaries and as streak lines within the
current system.  When used in conjunction with infrared imagers such as 
AVHRR,
a synergism is realized that increases the mapping capabilities of both
sensors.  Mesoscale features include western and eastern boundary currents,
rings, eddies, fronts, equatorial waves, upwellings, and similar features.
These fluctuations, e.g., Gulf Stream rings, transport large amounts of heat
and momentum, and as such are important processes in the general 
circulation of
the ocean.  They are also key links of biological ocean processes (Schumacher
et al, 1991).  <a href="fig4.2.gif">Figure 4-2 </a>shows
multifrequency AIRSAR images of the California Current, a typical mesoscale
boundary current along the eastern edge of the Pacific Ocean.  The three 
images
were made at P, L, and C-bands and show significantly different information.
As in other applications, the SARs all-weather capability is a major asset in
observing regions of the sea covered by persistent clouds or fog, as is often
the case in this region of California.  The deployment of an along-track
interferometric SAR would make possible line-of-sight surface current
velocities which will be exceedingly valuable in understanding these 
phenomena.
Such measurements strongly complement and augment the radar altimeter's
measurements (e.g., TOPEX/POSEIDON) of time-varying geostrophic currents by
providing a quantitative determination of the surface current, not just the
geostrophic portion; these current measurements would also resolve small-
scale
processes as they would operate at much higher resolution than the altimeter.
An example is shown on the left of <a href="fig4.3.gif">Figure
4-3</a>, which illustrates two SAR current-velocity maps of the Gulf
Stream made from the NASA AIRSAR operating in its along-track 
interferometric
mode, taken during the recent ONR High-Res Experiment (Thompson et al., 
1994)
and color coded as to east (upper) and north (lower) components of velocity.
Superimposed on these are red current vectors determined by a Doppler hf 
radar
system on shore.  A comparison of the current-velocities measured by the
well-established Doppler hf system and the SAR velocities (scatter diagrams on
the right side of <a href="fig4.3.gif">Figure 4-3</a>), argues that
the SAR is measuring open-ocean surface currents with good fidelity, 
although
problems remain with establishing the zeroes of Doppler shift (Thompson and
Jensen, 1993).  In the deep sea, much spatial and temporal averaging is
possible, which would enhance the accuracy of the data.  Assuming that
open-ocean surface current velocities can ultimately be determined
satisfactorily from space-based SAR, the combination of SAR and IR imagers,
radar altimeters, and in-situ observations beneath the surface will allow the
oceanic component of fluxes of heat and momentum and their variations to be
well determined.  Such measurements would contribute strongly to the 
objectives
of Mission to Planet Earth.<p>
<p>
 (3)	<b>Surface Wind Speed/Stress</b>.  The SAR is actually an imaging
scatterometer, and one that is radiometrically calibrated can be used to
determine scalar wind speed via absolute backscatter measurements.  However,
such measurements are contaminated by surfactants, upwellings, etc., (as are
wind-scatterometer measurements) so that ancillary information is required.
Surface wind stress, waves, and surface currents are related, but in a
complicated, nonlocal fashion.  Low resolution and wide swath observations,
similar to those for currents in the open ocean, are required for the winds,
with the required resolutions being finer than the scales of frontal systems
and storm gradients at sea.  These would complement the coarse-scale winds
(10-50 km) obtained from wind scatterometers.<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Open-Ocean Internal Waves.</b>  Large solitary waves are generated 
by
flows over topographic features, generally but not exclusively near shore, and
are known to propagate for hundreds of kilometers in the open ocean.  They
contribute unknown amounts to the global internal wave spectrum.
High-resolution SAR images of such waves in the deep sea have been obtained,
but are rare, and more data are needed for survey purposes (Rufenach et al.,
1985).  If the ATISAR is implemented in a high-resolution mode, the surface
currents can be used in a model to obtain the underwater amplitude and 
current
fields.  In addition, deep bathymetric features such as mid-ocean ridges and
seamounts are suspected to be sources of open-ocean signatures, including
internal waves.  Russian work suggests that topography as deep as 5000 m may
have surface expression through formation of a "Taylor-cone;" similar 
features
are speculated to occur in convective regions of the ocean (Carsey and 
Garwood,
1993)<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC38">Coastal
Oceans and Marine Operations
</a><p>
<p>
Although coastal oceans and estuaries comprise about 10% of the Earth's
surface, they produce about 25% of global biomass production. In the coming
decades, the effects of global change and human activities will be especially
pronounced in the coastal zone "where measurements are difficult to make and
processes difficult to model because of the many more factors that influence
the system, compared to the open ocean." (OSB,  1992,  p.107), and cross-shelf
exchange processes are poorly understood.  Here the spatial scales vary from
tens of meters to kilometers and temporal scales from tens of minutes to a few
days (Liu et al., 1994a).  Surface forcing by winds and waves drive vertical
mixing throughout much of the water column, depending on season and 
geography,
and ice can play a unique role (Liu et al., 1994b).  High-resolution surface
current and wind speed observations from the ATISAR would be especially
valuable here; in a recent review (Flemming, 1995) operational users listed
surface currents and sea surface temperature fields to be the two most 
valuable
ocean data products of those discussed for development.  <a
href="fig4.4a.gif">Figures 4-4 (a)</a> and <a
href="fig4.4b.gif">4-4 (b)</a> respectively show a Seasat L-band SAR
scene taken southeast of Nantucket, Mass., in July 1978, and a Skylab
Ektachrome photograph of the same region taken several years earlier; both 
of
these display many signatures of features that typify those in coastal oceans;
the image will be used as an example for this discussion.<p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Underwater Topography. </b> The medium and fine-scale bathymetry 
of the
region is mirrored in surface roughness variations caused by tidal flow and
associated wave spectral changes over shallow areas.  A comparison of the
lighter patterns from bottom-reflected light in the photograph with the
roughness variations in the SAR image demonstrates that underwater shoals
having depths from perhaps 5 to 50 m are imaged with SAR via surface 
roughness
and radar backscatter variations.  There is a successful quantitative theory
for this process that uses a Boltzmann-like equation to describe the changes to
the surface wave spectrum that lead to the signatures.<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>Upwelling and Air-Sea Interaction.</b>  The pumping up of colder
subsurface water to the surface shows up in this image as a smoother (lower
backscatter) area east of Nantucket, the "Nantucket Upwelling," well known to
local fishermen and sailors.  Reduced sensible and latent fluxes over the
colder water because of lowered air-sea temperature differences is 
accompanied
by reduced atmospheric turbulence levels, and thus less roughness in the
regions of the cooler ocean contacting the atmosphere. In VV polarization, 
such
a pattern would appear similar to this HH-image under stable air/sea
conditions; however, under unstable conditions, the polarizations would differ
significantly, thereby identifying areas of strong evaporation.<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Internal Waves.</b>  To the east of Nantucket is a region of
quasiperiodic oscillations that are surface signatures of internal waves, or
propagating underwater motions supported by density gradients.  They are
generated by tidal flow over Georges Bank to the east through complex 
nonlinear
processes.  Such a phenomenon is better illustrated by <a
href="fig4.5.gif">Figure 4-5</a>, which is an ERS-1 C-band/VV SAR
image of the ocean near the Hudson Canyon southeast of New York; the
bathymetric contours are shown in red.  The packets of quasiperiodic
oscillations are internal solitary waves, or solitons, generated by tidal flow
near the edge of the continental shelf break (the region of highest gradient of
bathymetry).  Each semidiurnal tidal cycle (approximately 12 h) during the
spring, summer, and fall, the tidal currents flowing offshore produce a
depression of the upper layers of the sea that quickly develop into nonlinear
oscillations. As these solitons propagate, the larger waves travel faster than
the smaller ones, and there is a sorting of the waves by amplitude and hence
wavelength.  <a href="fig4.5.gif">Figure 4-5</a>
presents a history of seven packets generated by the previous 3 days of tidal
action.  The lifetimes of the solitons are of order 1 to 2 days. When they
break inshore, they resuspend bottom sediments, thus adding nutrients to the
water column, greatly enhancing biological productivity, and altering the
optical opacity of the water column significantly.<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Soloy.</b>  This Russian word describes combined upwelling and 
mixing
caused by flow against a topographic feature.  <a
href="fig4.6a.gif">Figure 4-6 (a)</a> is an S-band/HH image from the
Russian spacecraft Almaz-1, made on July 5, 1991 off the west coast of Ireland.
The soloy is occurring at an indentation in the continental shelf and is the
source of internal waves seen at the upper left.  <a
href="fig4.6b.gif">Figure 4-6 (b)</a> is a simultaneous NASA/AIRSAR
image at P, L, and C-bands/VV, taken along the swath shown in <a
href="fig4.6a.gif">Figure 4-6 (a)</a>; the lowest frame is a
color-composite of the three frequencies.<p>
<p>
(5)	<b>Coastal Wave Refraction.</b>  Surface waves in water of 
approximately
one-half their wavelength feel the effects of the bottom and undergo
refraction, focusing/ amplification, and defocusing/diminution. For example, 
in
the New York Bight, storm waves arriving from the east impact the shorelines 
of
New Jersey and Long Island quite differently.  The wave refraction patterns
must be observed during the storm in order to understand the effects 
correctly,
and this only can be provided by SAR on aircraft or spacecraft.<p>
<p>
(6)	<b>Shoreline Changes.</b>  Storm damage to coastlines and loss of land 
due
to sea level rise are significant issues in a milieu of global change.  The
SARs ability to image through clouds and storms makes it a valuable 
instrument
for observations during storms (Zhang et al., 1994).<p>
<p>
(7)	<b>Coastal Watch.</b>  Repeated SAR observations on the scale of Figures
<a href="fig4.4a.gif">4-4 a</a> and <a href="fig4.5.gif">4-5
</a>will allow monitoring of coastal and estuarine waters for a variety
of information. Essentially any process leading to a change in radar
backscatter of a few percent can be observed under normal wind conditions.
Here multiparameter SARs may be of even more importance for detecting 
subtle
changes in the coastal environment.<p>
<p>
(8)	<b>Surfactant Monitoring.</b>  Detection of natural and man-made slicks 
on
the sea is crucial to the protection of the environment and the enforcement of
regulations.  In order to demonstrate the signatures of various types of oils
and other surfactants such as oleic acids, a controlled release of oils and
surfactants in the North Sea was made recently by German scientists and 
imaged
by SIR-C/X; the slicks are readily detectable and appear as regions of
variously reduced backscatter (Wahl et al., 1993; True et al., 1994; Wismann et
al., 1993).<p>
<p>
(9)	<b>Monitoring of Shipping and Search and Rescue.</b>  Ships and ship 
wakes
are often detectable in SAR images (Griffin et al, 1992; Fu and Holt, 1992),
and the line-of-sight velocity of the vessels can be estimated from their
Doppler shifts. Wakes include both the invariant 39 degrees Kelvin wake, and 
in
stratified water, occasionally an internal wave wake.  <a
href="fig4.7.gif">Figure 4-7</a> is a summertime ERS-1 image of a
large vessel in the Skagaarak off Sweden, and shows a long, asymmetrical
internal wave wake.  Monitoring of vessels in the US Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) via hard echoes and wake detection is a possibility, although 100%
detection probability is not assured.  Similarly, support of search-and-rescue
operations is feasible via SAR or real-aperture radar (RAR) on aircraft.<p>
<p>
(10)	<b>Fisheries Support.</b>  Wind-driven offshore transport and turbulent
mixing have important effects on the larval survival and subsequent 
recruitment
of many fish species (Bakun and Parish, 1982).  Space-based SAR can locate
current boundaries, fronts (Grabak et al., 1994), convergence zones, eddies,
and ice fields, all of which influence commercially-important fish populations
(Burns et al., 1981).<p>
<p>
The addition of a current-measuring mode to a future SAR system would 
enlarge
the suite of environmental data significantly and greatly enhance the
information available for change management and regulatory enforcement as 
well
as an increased value to science.  Prediction of coastal currents via numerical
models that are tuned and initialized by current measurements of all types
(especially including SAR) is a capability that is highly desirable.  Obtaining
a two-dimensional realization of surface current velocities would add greatly
to the efficacy of marine forecasts, fish stock assessment (Fiedler et al.,
1984), vessel drift, search-and-rescue, and similar items requiring a 
knowledge
of surface drifts.<p>
<p>
Information from the combination of an advanced SAR, an ocean color 
scanner,
and a thermal-infrared scanner will be of much relevance to science and
applications in coastal waters.  There, spatial scales vary from tens of meters
to tens of kilometers, and, in shallow depths, the surface signatures visible
in imaging devices are connected more closely with subsurface conditions 
than
is the case in the deep ocean. Thus the SAR for coastal oceanography needs 
high
resolution (25 m) and a narrower swath (100 km) than its open-ocean 
equivalent.
It also needs more frequent revisit times.  These requirements argue for a US
receiving station in the contiguous 48 states having real-time processing and
analysis capabilities for the present-day SAR systems.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC39">Marine
Boundary Layer Meteorology
</a><p>
<p>
In both the open and coastal oceans, various atmospheric signatures, usually
due to wind stress and its gradients, are seen with varying sensitivities.  It
should be cautioned that these investigations are recent and are not yet fully
established capabilities.  The realization that SAR shows atmospheric effects
is only now being appreciated and still ill-understood.  The subject is an
important area of investigation in the SAR program proposed ahead.<p>
<p>
(1)	S<b>urface Wind Stress.</b>  One prospect is the quantitative 
measurement
of surface wind stress by the SAR (see Gerling, 1986; Shuchman et al., 1994;
Wackerman et al., 1994), where backscatter observations may be interpreted as
with a wind scatterometer. The development of a scatterometric SAR is in its
infancy but the promise clearly exists.  An example of such effects is shown in
<a href="fig4.8.gif">Figure 4-8</a> (Alpers, pri. comm., 1994),
which is an ERS-1 C-band image of the Straits of Messina between Italy and
Sicily made late at night.  One observes katabatic or drainage winds flowing
down mountain valleys and out to the sea.  Also visible are long, periodic
signatures paralleling the coast that are thought to be eddies, internal waves,
and atmospheric roll vortices of some type.  These atmospheric processes are
being imaged via differential roughness at the short Bragg wavelengths of the
ocean surface wave spectrum.  A number of similar atmospheric processes 
have
been investigated in SAR data (Vachon, 1994; Pri. Comm., W. Alpers and G.
Stilke paper submitted to <i>J. Geophys. Res</i>., "Observation of an undular
bore in the marine atmosphere by the synthetic aperture radar aboard the 
ERS-1
satellite.")<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>Atmospheric Convection. </b> In real aperture radar (RAR) imagery 
taken
at Ku/VV (15 GHz) frequencies, atmospheric convective cells are made 
manifest
via the variations of surface wind stress that they cause at the surface. <a
href="fig4.9.gif">Figure 4-9 </a>shows simultaneous HH (Panels 1 and
3) and VV (Panels 2 and 4) RAR images from the Russian Toros aircraft radar;
vertically polarized images show atmospheric stress variations due to the
convective cells, while horizontally polarized images show internal wave 
strain
rates.  Larger incidence angles favor the imaging of such features.  The
differences between such dual polarized images allow one to identify regions 
of
atmospheric convection over the ocean.  It may even be possible, using data
from multiparameter SARs, to make estimates of the evaporative flux 
occurring
in such unstable regions.  Such measurements would be of first-order 
importance
to atmospheric dynamics on the time scales of both weather and climate.  
Direct
space-derived estimates of evaporative flux observations are not currently 
part
of Mission to Planet Earth.<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Rain Rates.</b>  The X-band system on the SIR-C/X-SAR radar has 
recently
observed what appear to be rainfall patterns.  While not yet quantified, the
promise of high-resolution measurement of tropical rain rates is clear.  In
studies of the ENSO (El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation) phenomenon and
short-term climate variability, the determination of realistic rainfall rates
(which are measures of the release of the latent heat of evaporation to the
atmosphere) is paramount to the parameterization of numerical models of the
coupled ocean-atmosphere system.  Cloudiness and rain in the tropics are
sub-grid processes about which much remains unknown.  Their importance 
was
reaffirmed in the recent Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere/Coupled
Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA/COARE) campaign.<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Rain Patterns.</b>  In addition to rain rate measurements, it is known
that SAR can image rainfall patterns on the sea surface via (a) damping of
Bragg scatterers in the region of heavy rain, which leads to a "rain-free hole"
and (b) the increased stress of atmospheric winds in the region of downdrafts
and outflows from local rain storms, which shows up as a larger area of
increased backscatter.  It is possible that local wind speeds can also be
inferred from the backscatter variations within the storm footprint.  Again,
these observations are of small scale but of large importance to climate
studies.<p>
<p>
	The realization that SAR shows atmospheric effects is recent and still 
not
well-understood.  The area is an important one to investigate in future SAR
programs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC40">Polar
Oceans
</a><p>
<p>
In the polar oceans, the fluxes of heat, momentum, mass, and salt that result
from air-sea-ice interactions play fundamental roles in the global climate
system (Aagaard and Carmack, 1995; Maykut, 1986; Stouffer et al., 1989).  The
dynamics and thickness of the sea ice cover are the key elements of these
fluxes.  Ice motion controls the distribution of thin ice and therefore surface
exchange processes dependent on ice thickness, including heat flux to the
atmosphere, ice production, and the associated salinity production in the polar
oceans.  As ice thickens by growth and deformation, the turbulent heat 
exchange
between the ice-covered ocean and the atmosphere is reduced.  Detailed
time-series measurements of ice motion and thickness from satellite sensors 
are
essential in providing estimates of these fluxes. <p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Fluxes.</b>  At present, heat and salt fluxes may be estimated using
repeated SAR data for ice motion, radiative fluxes estimated by other means,
and modeled air temperatures and winds.  These approaches parameterize ice
thickness changes, which are notoriously difficult to measure (Bourke and
McLaren, 1992) and essentially assume that the sea is at its freezing
temperature.  While such an assumption is valid in the wintertime Arctic, it is
known to be significantly in error in the marginal seas and in much of the
Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.  The estimation of surface fluxes and
the response of the upper ocean is also important at the ice margin (Carsey 
and
Roach, 1994)<p>
<p>
	For areas in which there are significant oceanic fluxes, a direct 
measurement
of ice thickness over time is the optimal approach for deriving heat and
salinity transport.  There are good indications that ice thicknesses of less
than 100 cm can be estimated using the like-channels (HH and VV) of a
polarimetric L-Band SAR (see Drinkwater et al., 1992), as shown in <a
href="fig4.10.gif">Figure 4-10</a> (Winebrenner et al., 1995).
Copolar phases ranging from -50 degrees to +30 degrees have been observed in
ice of differing apparent thickness; such values span both lower-than-
expected
values for thick ice and higher-than-expected values for open water.  A model
has been developed that explains these variations, and it has considerable
potential for robustly estimating sea ice thickness using magnitudes and 
phases
of SAR data; cross-polarized data are not required.  Field validation and
time-series data are needed to diagnose both the polarimetric and the ice
growth models, in order to estimate ice growth over time.  This work is of
great importance for accurate estimates of surface fluxes in polar regions,
where intermediate and deep water-mass formation takes place.  For the
short-term, surface fluxes relying on repeated coverage of single-channel 
SAR
is the only solution; in future, a polarimetric L-band SAR system to directly
measure ice thickness changes is highly desirable.<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Ice Dynamics.</b>  Ice motion is a key variable for predicting ocean-
ice
fluxes. During the last several years, maps of the vector motions of Arctic sea
ice have been automatically generated from SAR data by the ASF (Kwok et al.,
1992; Holt et al., 1992).  The ice-motion algorithm identifies the same sea ice
features seen in pairs of SAR images taken three or more days apart and then
derives their absolute motion relative to a fixed geographical grid.  Ice
motion vector maps have been made of several regions of the Arctic and
Antarctic Oceans, with the densest coverage being over the Beaufort/Chukchi
Seas extending over a period of greater than two years.  Ice motion maps have
been used to examine lead dynamics (Stern et al., 1994), oceanic circulation in
the Arctic Ocean and the Weddell Sea (Kwok and Colony, 1994), and ice fluxes
through the Fram Strait (Schweiger and Rothrock, 1994).  The RADARSAT
Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) is being developed to monitor ice motion,
to determine ice age, and to infer ice growth rates and surface fluxes for the
Arctic Ocean, the marginal ice zone, and its adjoining seas (Kwok et al.,
1994).  This technology is useful and well-developed, and should be continued
and enhanced with SAR data to come.<p>
<p>
(5)	<b>Monitoring and Prediction of Iceberg Motion.</b>  Airborne and
spaceborne SAR systems are useful for monitoring icebergs, but the
detectability of icebergs depends on many factors such as the SAR system
characteristics (e.g., frequency, signal-to-noise ratio, incidence angle, and
polarization), as well as the physical characteristics of the iceberg (i.e.,
size and shape) and environmental characteristics (e.g., sea state).  Studies
have shown that higher-frequency SAR instruments provide greater radar 
return
from icebergs.  Additionally, a cross-polarized SAR system can be used to
enhance the contrast between icebergs and the oceanic background.<p>
<p>
(6)	<b>Sea and Lake Ice Coverage.</b>  Experience with ERS-1 has 
demonstrated
the utility of SAR for analysis and forecasting of sea and lake ice.  Ice
parameters obtainable from this SAR include concentration, age, location of
leads and polynyas, and ridge location and density.  Research into SAR 
imaging
suggests that in the future, multipolarization/ multifrequency SAR 
measurements
will allow acquisition of (1) improved ice-type and ice concentration data
during the spring, when melt processes complicate the interpretation of 
simple
SAR imagery (Onstott, 1992; Fetterer et al., 1994), and (2) improved
discrimination between open water, new ice, and first-year ice (Steffen and
Heinrichs, 1994). <p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC41">CURRENT
AND PLANNED SAR ASSETS AND THEIR USE
</a><p>
<p>
From the viewpoint of either a research or an operational program, the
existence of ongoing, continuous flights is essential.  However, the other side
of such a commitment is that technical capabilities, especially sensors,
advance only slowly in such programs.  Almost all of the SARs on recent
spacecraft (excepting SIR and the two Russian SARs) are single polarization,
single channel devices.  Therefore the opportunity to perform the kinds of
sophisticated analyses of SAR imagery that have been suggested above will be
quite limited. Thus, while the extra-U.S. programs will provide useful,
continuing data, the diversity of the channels, and hence the information
derivable from them, is quite limited.  Repeat data at 3 to 5-day intervals
from near-term systems are required to track and monitor ocean mesoscale 
and
ice features for operational programs such as Coastal Watch, for tracking of
storms and icebergs, and for fisheries monitoring.<p>
<p>
The analysis of SAR capabilities and ongoing programs above clearly points to
an important role that NASA should play in the future--as developer and
operator of advanced, multiparameter synthetic aperture radars that use the
data as measurements, rather than just as backscatter maps of the oceans and
sea ice.  Furthermore, it will be important for both oceanic and polar science
to have the sensors in high-inclination orbits, preferably near-polar, so that
high-latitude processes may be observed.  The orbit should be prograde so as to
precess through the day/night cycle as rapidly as possible, to avoid aliasing
diurnal effects into seasonal ones.<p>
<p>
A review of the requirements given earlier suggest that the following future
SAR configurations would serve a large percentage of the research and
operational needs of the Nation (<a href="tab4.1.gif">Table 4-1</a>).<p>
<p>
Thus this future program posits two distinct types of missions, one having
modes with both high and low resolution, each with an along-track
interferometric SAR capability; and one with a single channel looking both 
left
and right.<p>
<p>
A significant amount of research and development needs to be undertaken 
before
the ATISAR can be exploited with confidence; on the other hand, the 
SpectraSat
technology has been proven, and a program could be launched with little 
further
development.  <p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>
<a name="RTFToC42">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
It is clear from the above discussion that SAR observations are highly valuable
to the ocean and ice sciences, as well as serving numerous operational
requirements.  Very good data have been obtained on surface and internal 
waves,
coastal ocean processes, variations in bottom topography/bathymetry,
upwellings, small-scale and mesoscale currents, rainfall variations, surface
wind speed and stress, atmospheric convection, sea ice cover, marginal ice-
zone
processes, ice age, leads, polynyas, vessel wakes, surfactant/oil
distributions, and a variety of other processes leading to subtle variations in
surface roughness. Many of these observations are unique to SAR; others take
advantage of the operation of SAR under conditions of cloud cover and
nighttime.  SAR data to support scientific analysis, algorithm development, and
process modeling are now acquired from international satellites, airborne
systems, and SIR-

C/X-SAR.
 However, additional exciting scientific prospects are in the early stages of
development; of special scientific and applications interest is the
determination of surface currents in the open sea and in the coastal zone 
using
along-track interferometry. Such a capability would be of utmost importance 
in
understanding ocean circulation. Commercial and applications interests that 
may
be served include: wave and marine weather forecasting, Gulf Stream 
nowcasting,
ship routing, ship and surfactant and slick surveillance in the EEZ, fish stock
assessment, coastal monitoring, iceberg warning, and sea ice cover. <p>
<p>
Specific recommendations are:<p>
<p>
(1)	Continue with and significantly strengthen the U.S. research and
development program in SAR oceanic/atmospheric/polar science and 
applications.
The promise of SAR in these areas is considerable and needs proper support to
yield a return to the nation that is appropriate to its investment in SAR
programs to date.  A vigorous airborne SAR program with the AIRSAR is 
needed to
support multiparameter SAR sensor development investigations using
multifrequency, polarimetric, interferometric data, and to serve as a test-bed
for advanced concepts in SAR observations.<p>
<p>
(2)	Undertake a three-satellite program with a polar orbiting ATISAR, a
SIR-C/X-SAR free-flyer, and a SpectraSat being the major program elements.  
The
AIRSAR is needed throughout the program as a developmental platform and as 
a
source of scientific verification and studies.  These programs will ultimately
produce along-track interferometric data over the oceans of first-order
importance to Mission to Planet Earth, to Global Change objectives, and to
operational agencies.<p>
<p>
(3)	Provide improved access by U.S. scientists to the SAR available from
international programs.  These data sets are known to be quite good in topics
such as sea ice and mesoscale features. In addition, cooperation with foreign
space agencies in science activities and even in joint flight programs should
be sought; for example, Russian Federation boosters are capable of injecting
the SIR-C/X-SAR free-flyer into the medium altitude polar orbit desired.<p>
<p>
(4)	Maintain close cooperation with NASA and other government agencies 
having
appreciable marine responsibilities.  These include NOAA, Navy, NSF, USGS, 
EPA,
Coast Guard, and Army Corps of Engineers.  Other-agency support was highly
valuable during the evolution of Landsat and Seasat.<p>
<p>
(5)	Develop, in concert with a larger community of scientists, a more 
detailed
scientific program plan for use of SAR, in a fashion similar to the NASA space
physics and astronomy/astrophysics programs several years ago.<p>
<p>
(6)	Blend the requirements for use of SAR in oceans/atmospheres/ice with 
those
from the other Earth science disciplines to arrive at a specification for a
spacecraft program that serves a broad range of needs in Earth science and
applications.  Reports to date show significant commonality of both sensors 
and
spacecraft.<p>

<a name="RTFToC44">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
Ice sheets and glaciers form the largest component of perennial ice on this
planet.  Over 75% of the world's fresh water is presently locked up in these
frozen reservoirs.  Their extents, however, undergo considerable fluctuations.
The expansion and reduction of ice sheets and glaciers from glacial periods to
interglacial periods has been one of the most dramatic climatic signals in
Earth history.  Even on short time scales of a few years, changes in ice volume
have modulated and continue to modulate, sea level.  This has never been more
important than it is today, given the increase in economic development of
coastal areas.  Recent evidence of the rapidity with which sea level has
changed due to rapid changes in ice-sheet discharge has heightened our
awareness of the dynamic nature of this icy component of our climate.  While 
it
is certain that small glaciers are experiencing broad retreat and contributing
to sea level rise by increased melting, the contributions of the two largest
ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, which contain over 98% of the world's
ice, remain unknown.<p>
<p>
Ice sheets, by their very presence, affect global climate. Greenland and
Antarctica both are dominated by large cold ice sheets that rise to high
elevations and are among the highest albedo objects on Earth.  Despite these
similar characteristics, their effects on the climate have important
differences.  Antarctica has a nearly circular symmetry which encourages the
development of strong zonal circulations of the atmosphere and ocean around 
it.
On the other hand, Greenland sits as an obstacle to zonal circulations,
deflecting the flow of the jet stream and preventing the establishment of
strong zonal circulation.<p>
<p>
Understanding these roles of ice sheets and glaciers in climate has been the
focus of a small group of scientists for a relatively short period of time.
The size of the community and the relative "newness" of glaciology are due, in
part, to the remoteness and harsh climate of glacierized regions.  These facts
are juxtaposed with the climatic importance of ice sheets.  Satellite remote
sensing has revolutionized this branch of climate science by empowering
glaciologists with instruments capable of collecting spatially extensive, yet
detailed, data sets of critical parameters.  SAR, with its ability to collect
ice-sheet data through cloud and throughout the extended polar night has
already demonstrated unique capabilities that make it an indispensable new 
tool
for the glaciologist.  This is only the beginning: more recent techniques, such
as interferometry, have expanded the uses of SAR in glacier and ice-sheet
research even farther, and promise glaciologists increased capabilities to
collect critical data.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC45">KEY
QUESTIONS
</a><p>
<p>
There are a number of key questions being addressed by glaciologists to which
SAR data can make substantial contributions.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC46">Are
glaciers and ice sheets useful indicators of current climate change?
</a><p>
<p>
Glaciers and ice sheets most commonly occur at high elevations and in remote
areas difficult to access.  Such areas are typically not included in climate
monitoring networks.  If ways can be found to extract useful climatic
parameters from observations of the ice, then ice sheets and glaciers provide
valuable extensions of more traditional climate monitoring networks.<p>
<p>
The interplay of annual cycles of snow accumulation and melting generates a
succession of snow facies that serve as valuable indicators of the climatic
regime characteristic of any point on an ice sheet or glacier (Williams et al.,
1991).  <a href="fig5.1.gif">Figure 5-1</a> illustrates the
essential subsurface stratigraphic characteristics.  Beginning with the 
highest
elevations, areas that experience no melt comprise the dry-snow facies. At
lower elevations, melt-water percolates into the underlying, sub-freezing 
snow
pack as a network of vertical ice pipes and horizontal ice lenses, forming the
percolation facies.  The amount of melt tends to increase at lower elevations.
Eventually, melt is extensive enough that the latent heat released by the
internal refreezing process warms the snow pack to the melting temperature
throughout, and a fraction of additional melt water is retained within the snow
pack in liquid form (the remainder leaves the ice mass as runoff).  This
situation characterizes the soaked-snow facies.  At the lowest elevations is
the bare-ice facies, formed when all surface snow is removed by ablation. The
upper edge of the bare ice facies marks the snow-line at the end of the mass
balance year.<p>
<p>
As climatic conditions change, so will the positions of these boundaries.
Conveniently, the low surface slopes of glaciers (typically 10<sup>-2</sup>)
and even lower surface slopes of ice sheets (typically 10<sup>-3)</sup>
transform subtle shifts of only a few meters in the elevations of these
boundaries to large horizontal shifts on the order of a few kilometers.  In
addition to indicating the altitudinal extent and intensity of melt, these
facies differ in spectral albedo.  Thus, as facies extents change, so does the
net radiation balance of the ice sheets.<p>
<p>
Glacier length is the glaciological parameter with the longest history of
observation.  While glacier-length changes clearly illustrate that climate has
changed, glaciers (and especially ice sheets) are one of the most sluggish
climate components.  Thus, the inverse problem of detecting or inferring
climate change from measurements of ice extent is very difficult.  This 
general
view does not hold, however, on smaller, steeper mountain glaciers whose
response times are of the order of years to decades.<p>

<p>
<a name="RTFToC47">How
do the ice sheets affect atmospheric and oceanic circulations?
</a><p>
<p>
The general effects of ice sheets on the atmosphere and oceans were discussed
above.  Clearly, changes in either the albedo of the surface (through a change
in snow facies extents), or changes in the geometric shapes of the ice sheets
will alter their climatic effect and perturb the global climate system.
Usually these changes are discussed in the extreme cases of glacial periods,
when surface temperatures in central North America or Europe fell an 
average of
10 to 12 degrees Celsius, but smaller changes in ice sheets will also perturb
the climate (Dawson, 1992).  The relationship is probably highly non-linear;
the climate record from Greenland ice cores shows that dramatic climate 
changes
can occur in much less than a decade (Alley et al., 1993).<p>
<p>
Remnants of vast armadas of icebergs have been detected in the western North
Atlantic, well beyond the reach of ice sheets (Heinrich, 1988).  It has been
suggested that the melting of these icebergs would introduce a sufficient
quantity of fresh water into the North Atlantic to completely transform the
global pattern of oceanic circulation, altering the climate in every corner of
the world (Broecker and Denton, 1989).<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC48">What
is the current mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers?
</a><p>
<p>
Ice-sheet or glacier mass balance is defined as the annual difference between
mass gain and mass loss.  It is important globally because it has a dominant
effect on sea-level change.  During the last glacial maximum, global sea level
was approximately 125 meters lower, the water being locked up primarily in 
the
now-extinct Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets of the Northern 
Hemisphere
and an expanded Antarctic ice sheet (Shackleton, 1987; Denton and Hughes,
1981). Present ice volume, which is contained mostly in the Antarctic and
Greenland ice sheets, is sufficient to raise sea level approximately 80 meters
(Bader, 1961, Drewry et al., 1982).<p>
<p>
By comparison, the annual turnover in ice-sheet mass is modest. Annual snow
accumulation over the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is equivalent to an
ocean layer only 6 mm thick (Bentley and Giovenetto, 1991; Ohmura and Reeh,
1991). A nearly equivalent amount of ice is returned to the oceans through
melting and iceberg discharge. Estimates of present mass balance are poorly
constrained: the Greenland ice sheet appears relatively stable, the Antarctic
ice sheet seems to be growing slowly and the remaining small glaciers and ice
caps are wasting away rapidly (Meier, 1993).  Oddly enough, this range of
behaviors may be due to the same phenomenon: global warming.  Warmer 
summer
temperatures enhance ice melting but also increase the frequency of
precipitation events, which could result in growth of ice sheets and glaciers.
In Antarctica almost no summer melt occurs except on the Antarctic Peninsula 
so
the increased snowfall would enlarge the ice sheet.  Mountain glaciers
experience a net reduction in mass at low elevations due to the warmer 
summer
temperatures, but, in some cases, may be growing at higher elevations.  In
Greenland, the two opposing effects appear to be roughly balanced.<p>
<p>
These conclusions are based on sparse data.  A notable weakness in one or 
more
of these present estimates of mass balance is that they fail to add up to the
present rate of sea-level change, even when liberal error estimates and other
contributing effects are included (Meier, 1993).  Confidence in predictions of
future sea-level change must be tempered until we better understand the 
current
mass balance of the existing ice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC49">What
are the controls on ice flow and are there inherent instabilities in ice flow
that could lead to dramatic changes in the dynamics of ice sheets or glaciers?
</a><p>
<p>
The subject of ice dynamics ranges from deformation and recrystalization of
individual crystals, to surge-type glaciers, to the flow of the Antarctic ice
sheet.  Most of the controlling processes lie hidden within or underneath the
ice, but the effects are clearly evidenced by deformation and flow of the ice.
This topic is relevant to global climate because of the effect altered ice flow
has on ice volume and, therefore, on sea level.<p>
<p>
The ice-sheet environment determines the magnitudes of both snow 
accumulation
and melting, but ice dynamics determines the rate at which ice is delivered to
the oceans or to ablation areas.  Thus, ice dynamics is a major component of
the mass balance.  This becomes obvious when examining the record of sea 
level
since the last glacial maximum 20,000 years ago (<a
href="fig5.2.gif">Figure 5-2</a>).  During this period, sea level rose
episodically in a series of brief jumps rather than smoothly.  Geologic
evidence confirms that these jumps correspond to the partial or complete
collapses of marine-based ice sheets.  Such behavior apparently caused sea
level to rise at rates of at least 35 mm/yr, more than twenty times the present
rate of rise.   Although no such collapses have occurred for the last 4000
years, the West Antarctic ice sheet is the last marine-based ice sheet on the
planet, and it contains enough ice to raise sea level more than five meters
(Drewry et al., 1982).  There is a pressing need to determine if, when, and how
rapidly this ice sheet may collapse.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC50">How
much of the heat absorbed by the surface snow pack is retained by the ice 
mass
and how much escapes as  meltwater?
</a><p>
<p>
Warm temperatures melt surface snow, and the resulting meltwater most often
drains into the underlying snow pack.  Residual colder winter temperatures in
this snowpack conduct heat away from the meltwater.  If the residence time of
the meltwater is sufficiently long, or if the snow pack is sufficiently cold,
the meltwater refreezes.  In this case, melting recorded at the surface does
not represent mass that leaves the glacier; rather, this mass is captured at
depth within the snow pack. On the other hand, if a system of snow-pack
drainage is well developed with surface streams and moulins (vertical cavities)
that quickly transport water through the glacier or ice sheet, not only can the
initial quantity of meltwater leave the glacier, but additional melting can
occur at the interface between rushing water and the surrounding ice.<p>
<p>
The importance of these two extreme cases is apparent when viewed from the
perspective of mass balance (Pfeffer et al., 1991).  In one case none of the
surface meltwater actually leaves the glacier, while in the other case the mass
lost from the glacier is actually more than the amount of meltwater produced 
at
the surface.  The relevance of this effect to climate change lies in the fact
that different snow facies respond differently to changing temperatures.  For
example, a formerly dry-snow area that begins to experience melt will retain
most of the meltwater for many years as the system of internal drainage
(comprised of vertical ice pipes and horizontal ice lenses) develops.  However,
a percolation facies that warms will be less effective at retaining increased
amounts of meltwater, possibly delaying its eventual transformation to a
soaked-snow facies.<p>

<a name="RTFToC51">ROLE
OF SAR IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS
</a><p>
<p>
SAR provides the obvious benefits of a weather-independent, day-night 
imaging
system.  These advantages are particularly crucial in the ice-sheet and glacier
environments where persistent clouds continue to hamper data acquisitions 
by
visible imagers and where the polar night imposes a prolonged period of
darkness.  In addition, unlike visible imagers, radar penetrates the snow
surface, which provides glaciologists with a tool capable of sensing internal
properties of the ice sheet or glacier.<p>
<p>
Before ERS-1 was launched, limited SAR data of ice sheets only hinted at the
potential glaciological uses of SAR.  ERS-1 data have allowed full
demonstration of many of these uses and have expanded the glaciological
applications of SAR to even broader horizons.<p>
<p>
The list that follows identifies the key parameters of ice sheets and glaciers
that can be measured with SAR, and describes how glaciologists will be able to
use this information to answer the key questions identified above.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC52">Snow
Facies
</a><p>
<p>
Radar penetrates the snow surface, so the measured backscatter is a 
combination
of surface and volume scattering.  This characteristic enables SAR to
discriminate clearly between all the snow facies described above using
backscatter amplitude data alone.  This discrimination is most effective during
middle to late winter when surface water is absent.  Dry snow appears dark in
SAR because both surface scattering and volume scattering are low.  At lower
elevations, in the percolation facies, backscatter rises dramatically due to
volume scattering from the network of subsurface ice bodies.  The soaked-
snow
facies is composed of larger snow grains than the dry-snow facies because 
both
melt-water and warmer temperatures serve to accelerate grain growth.  Thus, 
the
soaked-snow facies is radar dark when water is present, but in winter the
backscatter increases to a level intermediate to the radar-dark dry-snow facies
and radar-bright percolation facies.  Finally, the bare-ice facies is radar
dark due to strong specular surface scattering.  <a
href="fig5.3.gif">Figure 5-3 </a>clearly shows these different snow
facies in a SAR-image mosaic of the Greenland ice sheet.  The northeast 
portion
of the dry-snow facies is slightly brighter than the rest of this facies.  This
is believed to be due to a decrease in the accumulation rate in this region
(Jezek, 1993; Ohmura and Reeh, 1991).  <a href="fig5.4.gif">Figure 5-4
</a>shows that the facies correlate closely with surface elevation.  The
ability to discriminate all the snow facies, which is impossible with visible
imagery, establishes the unique use of SAR in a monitoring program of ice
sheets for indications of climate change over their broad expanses.
SIR-C/X-SAR data of the Patagonian ice fields indicate that facies
discrimination is also possible using multifrequency data (Forster and Isacks,
1994).<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC53">Seasonal
Melt
</a><p>
<p>
Water is strongly radar-absorptive.  This permits the use of SAR for
monitoring of the summer melt season on ice sheets and glaciers. Time-series
SAR data of Greenland have demonstrated that the gradual refreezing of free
water at depth can be detected and have shown that this free-water component
exists for a surprisingly long time after the<p>
snow surface has cooled below freezing (<a href="fig5.5.gif">Figure
5-5</a>).<p>
<p>
Radar at lower frequencies penetrates more deeply into snow. Thus,
multi-frequency data permit a depth-variable view of the snowpack. This has
been most clearly demonstrated by SIR-C/X-SAR data of the Patagonian ice 
fields
(<a href="fig5.6.gif">Figure 5-6</a>).   While a capability does
not yet exist to quantify either the amount of melting or refreezing, the
multi-frequency SARs sensitivity to conditions at different depths is already
useful in monitoring the thermal and hydrologic evolution of ice sheets as
climate changes.  Future development of this capability will increase SARs
utility in this area even further.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC54">Icebergs</a><p>
<p>
Mass loss by iceberg calving exceeds mass loss by melting for the Antarctic ice
sheet and is approximately equal to the amount of surface melting for the
Greenland ice sheet (Bader, 1961).  Thus, this is a critical term in
determining ice-sheet mass balance (although it does not directly affect sea
level).  Icebergs are visible in cloud-free visible imagery, but the
requirements of a monitoring program include routine and dependable 
acquisition
of high-resolution imagery, even during the extended polar night.  These
requirements match the capabilities of SAR and make it the preferred 
instrument
for this activity.  <a href="fig5.7.gif">Figure 5-7 </a>shows that
icebergs as easily identified in SAR imagery.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC55">Surface
Morphology
</a><p>
<p>
Most surface morphological features are seen by either SAR or a visible 
imaging
system.  SAR holds the dual advantages of its all-weather, day-night capability
while visible imagers avoid image degradation caused by speckle.  Specific
features that can be identified include streams and lakes, flowbands (linear
forms stretched longitudinally in the direction of motion), ice edge, moraines
and crevasses (<a href="fig5.8.gif">Figure 5-8</a>).  The ability
to identify such features opens the door to monitoring their evolution.<p>
<p>
Lakes can be an especially good indicator of surface hydrologic activity.  They
tend to form in the same surface depressions each summer (locations fixed in
space by the flow of ice over bed undulations), and their size and numbers are
indications of the intensity of melt.  Thus, they serve as ancillary data to
the climate monitoring activity already described.<p>
<p>
Ice margins are important because they change in response to changes in the
flow of the ice.  The radar contrast at many ice margins is less distinct than
the contrast in visible imagery.  However, there are many situations where 
this
generality does not hold.  These include areas where persistent cloud cover
impedes collection of visible data, where fresh snow has covered the visible
contrast between ice and adjacent terrain, and where ice near the edge is
covered by rock or other debris.  In the last case, differences in the
polarization signatures of the moraine-covered ice and ice-free debris may
permit identification of the ice margin.<p>
<p>
Crevasses present serious hazards to field personnel but are one of the most
useful natural features for glaciological study.  Their orientations provide
information on the state of stress within the ice. A more quantitative use is
the measurement of ice motion accomplished by following unique crevasses or
crevasse patterns over time (see next section).  Additionally, SAR has
demonstrated an ability to detect crevasse fields where visible imagery cannot
(Hartl et al., 1994; Vaughan et al., 1994).  This is due to either the
detection of micro-cracks, below the resolution of the visible imagery, or from
detection of buried crevasses by penetrating through the surface layers of the
snow.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC56">Ice
Velocity
</a><p>
<p>
Ice velocity is one of the most fundamental parameters in the study of ice
dynamics.  The proven ability to obtain this information from time-sequential
imagery using a cross-correlation technique significantly expanded the 
amount
and density of such data available to glaciologists (Bindschadler and Scambos,
1991).  This technique tracks patches of the surface containing crevasses and
other surface features from one image to another by searching for the 
matching
pattern of surface features in a second image.  Displacements can be measured
to sub-pixel accuracy, but typical displacements should be at least a few
pixels to minimize the impact of systematic errors in coregistration of images
(typically 1 to 2 pixels) (Scambos et al., 1992).  Although developed initially
for visible imagery, this technique also has been shown to work with SAR
imagery (see <a href="fig5.9.gif">Figure 5-9</a>) (Fahnestock et
al., 1993).  A requirement of this technique is that the same sets of surface
features be resolvable in both images.  This requirement is not met over most
of the ice sheets, but is usually met in the most active flow regions.<p>
<p>
The application of interferometric techniques using SAR data holds the
potential of obtaining ice velocity data from any ice sheet region. The
technique utilizes the phase measurement of the backscattered radar pulse 
from
every ground pixel to make a sub-wavelength scale measurement of 
displacement
(usually a few millimeters) at every pixel (Goldstein et al., 1993).  In the
ideal case, the two images would be collected from the same point in space
(zero-baseline).  In practice, however, the baseline between observation 
points
is finite so the interferogram contains a combination of motion and 
topographic
information.  Images must be coregistered to sub-pixel accuracy and the
backscatter signatures from the same pixel in each image must be correlated 
for
the phase difference to have a physically meaningful interpretation.  Either a
different viewing geometry or metamorphic changes in the surface or 
subsurface
of a target pixel can destroy the phase correlation for a particular pixel.<p>
<p>
Successful ice-sheet interferograms have typically used time separations of
only a few days (Goldstein et al., 1993, Rignot et al., in press, Joughin et
al., in press).  <a href="fig5.10.gif">Figure 5-10</a> shows an
example of an interferogram from the Bagley Icefield in Alaska.
Interferometrically measured displacements are in the direction of view, 
which
for satellite SARs is in the range of 20 to 40 degrees from vertical.  If the
general direction of flow is known (along the regional surface gradient), one
velocity component is sufficient to estimate the total velocity.  Greater
precision in velocity requires that a second interferogram be obtained from a
different viewing angle.  This can usually be accomplished by acquiring 
image
pairs from both ascending and descending orbits.<p>
<p>
Because interferograms contain no absolute displacement information, only
velocity differences are obtained.  Nevertheless, velocity gradient data
(strain rates) are highly useful.  To obtain absolute velocities, a theoretical
minimum of two control values are needed to provide a datum and to correct 
for
along-track variations in baseline.  In practice, more control is desirable and
may be necessary.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC57">Surface
Topography
</a><p>
<p>
As mentioned above, interferometry with a non-zero baseline includes both
topographic and motion information because the measured range difference 
(in
units of phase) is the result of both surface movement and topography-
induced
parallax.  This mixture of topographic and motion information requires that 
the
topography be known with sufficient accuracy to remove its effects from the
interferometrically-determined phase differences, in order to extract ice
displacements. Fortunately, by using a third SAR image, an extremely clean
separation of the topographic and velocity signals is possible if the velocity
and topography are constant over the interval spanned by the three images 
(Kwok
and Fahnestock, in press).  <a href="fig5.11.gif">Figure 5-11</a>
shows an example of this separation.<p>
<p>
As with the interferometric velocity output, the extracted topographic output
is relative elevation, rather than absolute elevation.  In principle, a single
absolute elevation is sufficient to provide the datum for an entire
interferogram but, again, insufficient knowledge of the precise baselines for
each interferogram require that more elevation control points be used.  The
range of elevations spanned by a two-pi cycle of phase difference depends 
upon
the baseline.  For topographic relief of a particular scale, there is an
optimal range of baselines between the undesirable extremes of too short a
baseline, where insufficient parallax is achieved to resolve elevation
variations, and too long a baseline where phases decorrelate.  The accuracy of
the derived elevations also is  dependent upon the baselines of the
interferograms. In one study area, shown in <a href="fig5.12.gif">Figure
5-12</a>, relative elevation accuracies of less than 2 meters were
obtained with ERS-1 data having an effective baseline of 520 meters (Joughin 
et
al., 1994). Eventually, the flow of ice is expected to be well enough
understood that it will be possible to invert topographic and surface motion
data to obtain basal topography and basal shear stress, which are additional
parameters needed for ice-dynamics studies.<p>
<p>

<a name="RTFToC58">POSSIBLE
ADDITIONAL USES OF SAR DATA
</a><p>
<p>
The ability to make the measurements described above with SAR data was
demonstrated only after the collection of a substantial amount of ice-sheet
data by ERS-1.  The list is probably complete for the C-band, single
polarization SAR carried by ERS-1.  Before these data were available to
demonstrate these techniques, limited Seasat and airborne data could only
suggest the potentials that awaited glaciologists.  In the case of
interferometry, no mention of this now-proven technique was ever made in 
the
pre-ERS-1 ice-sheet community.  To extend this analogy, then, it probably is
impossible to predict accurately the future uses of a SAR enhanced with
additional polarizations and frequencies because multiple-frequency and
multiple-polarization data sets of ice sheets from which to extrapolate remain
very sparse.<p>
<p>
Therefore, additional necessary work is posed in the form of questions that
still need to be answered.  In the process of answering these questions, new
potential uses of SAR are likely to be discovered.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC59">Is
there a "best" SAR frequency for ice sheets and glaciers?
</a><p>
<p>
It is known that single-band data (C-band) permit almost all the analyses
summarized above because a wealth of such data has been collected, from 
which
these techniques have been developed.  Seasat provided a limited amount of
L-band data that confirmed it also can be used for snow facies, icebergs, and
surface morphology research (Bindschadler et al., 1987).  Limited airborne
P-band and X-band data have hinted that these frequencies may also be used
(Jezek et al., 1993).  Recently, Space-Shuttle-based multi-frequency (L- and
C-band), multi-polarimetric data have been added to the data pool.<p>
<p>
What has been missing is a methodical comparison of data of the same ice-
sheet
areas using different frequencies and including complex data so 
interferometric
products can be examined.  L-band and P-band penetrate deeper than C-band, 
but
the quantitative advantages and disadvantages of sensing deeper, older snow
have not been established.  A more diffuse volume-scattering component 
might
provide a more temporally stable signature of the various snow facies.
Airborne data have highlighted major differences in backscatter signatures 
when
the frequency shifts from P-band to C-band (with the intermediate L-band 
being
more like P-band) (Jezek et al., 1993).  Similar backscatter variations have
been seen in SIR-C/X-SAR data (cf. <a href="fig5.5.gif">Figure
5-5</a>) (Forster and Isacks, 1994).  These differences could lead to
techniques to derive a number of important variables including: grain-size
versus depth distributions (critical for the quantification of accumulation
rates from passive microwave data); meltwater production; and the amount of
free water retained by the snow pack (by following the depth of the winter
freezing wave as it penetrates the snow pack).<p>
<p>
Interferometric applications might be aided by lower frequencies that permit
longer baselines and have a relatively greater and more temporally stable
volume-scattering component, making them less sensitive to meteorological
events on the surface that decorrelate successive images.  However, the
increased contribution of the deeper volume scattering component could lead 
to
an enhanced geometric decorrelation sensitivity or lower signal-to-noise, thus
restricting available interferometric image pairs.<p>
<p>
P-band radar might even penetrate the full depth of some glaciers.  This would
make it possible to map subglacial topography using interferometric 
techniques.
Obtaining both surface and bed topography leads directly to ice volume--one 
of
the critical climatic parameters discussed at the outset of this chapter.  If
successful, this would substantially improve all existing ice-volume estimates
because existing data have been collected along linear ground tracks or flight
lines, so the resulting ice-thickness maps have been produced by spatial
interpolation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC60">Can
useful scientific information be obtained by studying polarization effects?
</a><p>
<p>
Limited polarization data have been used to determine the dielectric constant
and to extract the small-scale surface roughness of portions of the Greenland
ice sheet (Jezek et al., 1993).  The dielectric constant can be used to derive,
albeit indirectly,  surface albedo.  Albedo has obvious importance in the
energy balance of the ice sheet.  Surface roughness is also a necessary
consideration in exchange of energy because it affects the near-surface wind
profile.  Field measurements of surface roughness suffer from sampling
sparseness but would be a necessary component of surface-truth experiments
designed to develop the ability to remotely determine surface roughness.  
Given
that different radar frequencies are sensitive to surface roughness on
different scales, a wide spectrum of surface roughness may be obtainable.<p>
<p>
In winter, the percolation zone displays anomalous backscatter polarization
behavior.  Similar behavior has been observed elsewhere in the solar system,
ranging from icy Jovian moons to the Martian polar cap to, perhaps, a polar 
cap
on Mercury.  The common denominator seems to be ice, though not necessarily
water ice.  Anomalously polarized backscatter is, however, otherwise very rare
in the solar system. Theoretical explanations of this are speculative, but all
bear on the depth distribution of volume scattering.  In the case of the
percolation zone in Greenland, this depth distribution is linked to the
redistributions of melt water and heat.  This is of considerable interest
because melting is one of the major mass-loss mechanisms of the Greenland 
ice
sheet and could affect the salinity balance of the North Atlantic.
Understanding and using anomalously polarized backscatter as a remote-
sensing
tool could lead to a unique probe of physical properties of both terrestrial
and extraterrestrial icy regions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC61">What
are the physical processes that cause target decorrelation and what are their
relative effects?
</a><p>
<p>
It has been hypothesized that the occurrence of windstorms, snowfall, 
surface-
and depth-hoar formation, melting, and refreezing between the epochs of two 
SAR
images are meteorological events that can alter the backscatter signature from
the target sufficiently to decorrelate the phase data and prevent the
generation of interference fringes.  Few studies have been done to actually
quantify the effects of any of these events on the correlation of successive
images.  Jezek and Rignot (1994) hypothesized that spatial patterns of
decorrelation in one ERS-1 image pair of Greenland may actually be due to
variations in the distribution of snow deposited between the images.  At
C-band, 10 cm of fresh snow adds one additional wavelength (or fringe) to the
round-trip radar distance.<p>
<p>
More studies are necessary and will lead not only to guidelines for improving
the likelihood of collecting correlated image pairs from which interferometric
products can be produced, but also will produce meteorologically meaningful
data over a spatially broad scale as compared with local data provided by
sparsely distributed ice-sheet meteorological stations.  Independent views
afforded by interferometric SAR could prove valuable in interpreting the data
sets provided by passive microwave sensors or radar altimeters, both of which
also derive some of their signal from the sub-surface snow pack.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC62">WHAT
MUST BE DONE TO CONFIRM THESE POTENTIALS?
</a><p>
<p>
Most of the SAR technique-development investigations for ice-sheet and 
glacier
research require data at frequencies other than C-band.  Now that the C-band
data set is extensive enough over the ice covered areas, more limited coverage
at other frequencies can be placed into a meaningful context.  This research is
a necessary prerequisite to the development of a satellite SAR mission at any
frequency other than the proven C-band.  The fidelity and sparseness of JERS-
1
L-band data of ice sheets has failed to provide a data set capable of verifying
the utility of L-band data for glaciological studies.<p>
<p>
A critical component of the collection of data at frequencies other than C-band
is the collection of interferometric pairs spaced in time so that motion
information as well as topographic information are included in the phase
differences.  A particularly useful data set would be the collection of
interferometric triplets of a moving ice sheet in at least C-band and L-band.<p>
<p>
Ground truth is a mandatory part in the development of any new remote 
sensing
application.  This is certainly true with SAR data of ice sheets where volume
scattering is often the dominant backscatter component.  Field measurements 
are
the only certain means of documenting specific physical properties of the 
snow
pack and the temporal changes in these properties between remote data
collections.  To the extent possible, these measurements should be
contemporaneous with airborne or satellite SAR acquisitions.  Scattering
measurements made with ground-based radar systems provide a data set for
comparison with the remote measurements.  Standard techniques allow 
surface
parties to collect depth profiles of density, water content, grain size,
conductivity, permittivity, temperature, and icy inclusions.  These persons
also can record surface meteorological conditions and help optimize the
collection of SAR data from remote platforms.<p>
<p>

SAR ASSETS AND THEIR USE
</a><p>
<p>
ERS-1 has provided an invaluable SAR data set which has been used to 
establish
the scientific utility of SAR for ice-sheet and glacier research.  A few
interferometric pairs await analysis, but for the purposes of developing or
demonstrating new techniques, the use of this data set is virtually complete.
No plans exist to place ERS-1 into a short repeat cycle orbit so that
interferometric opportunities from this single satellite have probably ceased.
The continuation of the ERS series with ERS-2 and ENVISAT will allow 
monitoring
of the Greenland ice sheet snow facies to proceed.<p>
<p>
JERS-1 carries an L-band SAR.  It promised the same capabilities as ERS-1, but
damage caused by a faulty antenna deployment has compromised the quality of 
the
data.  Thus, it has not provided an adequate opportunity to assess the merits
of L-band data of ice sheets and glaciers relative to C-band.<p>
<p>
The AIRSAR facility (C-, L- and P-band antennas on a DC-8 aircraft) provides
the best existing means to collect the multi-frequency and multi-polarization
data sets needed to assess the relative merits of these different windows of
the electromagnetic spectrum.  Multiple antennas have the obvious advantage 
of
collecting simultaneous and coincident data.  From knowledge of the positions
of snow facies and surface features gleaned from the ERS-1 data set, aircraft
missions can be planned in a manner that optimizes the utility of the collected
data.<p>
<p>
A critical augmentation to AIRSAR is the ability to collect interferometric
data by navigating the aircraft with GPS real-time corrections.  This
capability will be crucial in investigations of the frequency-specific
characteristics of interferometric data.  The missions should be flown at
various times of the year during periods when particular meteorological 
events
(i.e., onset of melting and freezing, snowfall, high surface winds, etc.) are
most likely.<p>

<a name="RTFToC64">PLANNED
FUTURE MISSIONS
</a><p>
<p>
ERS-2, when launched, will continue the capability of the ERS-1 SAR.  An
exciting prospect is an ERS-1/ERS-2 tandem mission for the collection of
interferometric data.<p>
<p>
RADARSAT, carrying another C-band SAR, is planned for launch in 1995.  
After an
extended initial operational period, a scheduled orbit maneuver will afford
RADARSAT the first SAR-view of most of the Antarctic ice sheet, including the
regions south of latitude 78deg.S.  The primary goal of this maneuver is to map
the Antarctic ice sheet with SAR.  It will take approximately two weeks, less
than one orbit cycle, after which time RADARSAT will return to the nominal
north-looking configuration.  No possibilities exist for interferometric data
collection during this short period.  A second mapping may occur later in an
extended RADARSAT mission.  This mapping is exploratory, and it remains
tantalizingly impossible to predict all that may be discovered with these
data.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>
<a name="RTFToC65">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
SAR remains a technology that is grossly underutilized in proportion to its
proven capability to assist glaciologists in answering some of the most
pressing questions in their discipline.  These questions have direct relevance
to global climate and future sea-level change.<p>
<p>
SAR interferometry can provide data sets whose regional collection was never
before feasible, yet are crucial to glaciological studies.  A mission designed
to produce complete interferometric coverage of permanently ice-covered 
areas
promises extraordinary glaciological returns.<p>
<p>
The omission of large portions of the polar regions by virtually every
satellite mission to date continues a long, but undesirable, tradition that
restricts the glaciological utility of satellite data. At present more than 2/3
of the Earth's permanent ice cover cannot be viewed by existing spaceborne
SARs.  Modern awareness of the climatic importance of the polar regions must 
be
expressed in the ability of new sensors to extend their view to the poles.  As
in the case of RADARSAT, this polar view need not be available continuously,
but, unlike RADARSAT, when available, it should be for a number of repeat
cycles so that the enormous utility of SAR interferometry can be applied to the
glaciological problems of global significance.<p>
<p>
This chapter closes with the following specific recommendations:<p>
<p>
(1)	An interferometric mission at C-band should be conducted that includes
multiple-image views of all ice sheets and glaciers sufficient to yield
detailed surface topography and surface-velocity data sets.<p>
<p>
(2)	Future SAR missions should include maneuvering and data collection
capability sufficient to monitor all permanently ice-covered areas at least
once per year.<p>
<p>
(3)	Airborne and surface measurements should be carried out to assess the
relative merits of different frequencies and combinations of frequencies and
polarizations in deriving parameters needed to answer pressing glaciological
questions relevant to the global climate.<p>

<a name="RTFToC67">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
The purpose of this chapter is to delineate key science objectives in the solid
Earth sciences for future NASA orbital radar observations.  In order to
identify a future role for U.S. radars, it is necessary to specify the types of
data that are most needed by the community to answer current geological and
geodynamics questions, and to describe the surface phenomena that are best
studied using radar.  In each instance, it is pertinent to lay out a program of
radar observations and analyses that would maximize science returns at
reasonable cost.  The context for this chapter is to identify NASA's future
role in orbital radar systems following the successful completion of the SRL-1
and SRL-2 Shuttle Radar SIR-C/X-SAR experiments.  In particular, the relative
merits of potential U.S. radars compared to the current and future radar
systems to be flown by foreign agencies are addressed.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>
<a name="RTFToC68">BACKGROUND</a><p>
<p>
Research and discoveries in the solid Earth sciences over the past few decades
have revolutionized our understanding of the Earth.  For example, we now
realize that sea floor spreading and associated continental assembly and
breakup are primary modes by which the  Earth releases internal heat.  These
processes also control the locations and nature of volcanism and earthquakes.
Study of deep sea sediment cores shows that variations in solar insolation
related to changes in Earth's orbit caused Pleistocene glacial epochs.  The
role of these variations on modulation of the long term changes in Earth's
climate remains a hotly debated topic.  Research has also suggested long term
coupling between tectonics and climate, e.g., the emergence of the Tibetan
Plateau modified atmospheric circulation in ways that led to enhanced Indian
Ocean monsoons.  These enhanced monsoons caused increased weathering on 
the
Plateau, leading to increased consumption of carbon dioxide, and a Cenozoic
cooldown of the Earth.<p>
<p>
NASA's programs in geology and geodynamics have added significant results to
our increased understanding of Earth.  For example, GPS and VLBI 
measurements
of the velocities of lithospheric plates are consistent with ages inferred from
magnetic striping and geochronologies of oceanic crust.  Recently, coseismic
vertical displacements of centimeters have been measured using radar
interferometry (Massonnet et al., 1993, 1994; Zebker et al., 1994).  With
regard to continental assembly and break up, 23 digital Landsat scenes were
mosaicked, and field and isotopic data were used by Sultan et al. (1992) to
reconstruct the Nubian and Arabian Shields before opening of the Red Sea.
Results show that the great late-Proterozoic Najd transcurrent fault in fact
extends into the Nubian Shield and that the Red Sea opening was accomplished
with minimal crustal thinning. <p>
<p>
Studies of the solid Earth have also contributed in the area of global climatic
change and Earth systems science.  For example, Arvidson et al. (1994), using
SPOT stereogrammetric analyses, field work, and isotopic measurements, were
able to model the evolution of the interbedded Quaternary deposits in the
Eastern Desert, Egypt, and to show how eustatic sea level, tectonic uplift, and
climate affected landforms and deposits.  Brakenridge et al. (1994) have used
ERS-1 radar as an all-weather system to monitor flood water levels for the
great midwestern U.S. floods of 1993.<p>
<p>
Lacking in many of these studies of the solid Earth is a detailed knowledge of
the topography of the landscape, or the rate of deformation of the surface due,
for instance, to earthquakes or active volcanism.  It is with this background
of solid Earth sciences that measurement objectives for SAR are delineated in
the following sections.  Because of the increasing national relevance of
natural hazards, we also include objectives related to predicting and observing
hazards and monitoring their aftermath.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>
<a name="RTFToC69">CONTEXT
FOR U.S. RADAR MEASUREMENTS
</a><p>
<p>
The U.S. Global Change Research Program (GCRP) identified several key solid
Earth processes that have a bearing on Global Change.  These topics include
several that can be investigated with orbital radars: coastal erosion, volcanic
processes, surficial processes, and crustal motions and sea level change.  The
radar systems on board ERS-1, JERS-1 and, in the future RADARSAT and ERS-2, 
are
generally adequate for mapping these phenomena over large regions of the 
Earth
on a routine basis.  Where an image in a timely manner is all that is required,
these single-wavelength, single-polarization radars can be successfully
employed for a wide variety of solid Earth applications, including mapping
river flooding (Brakenridge 1994), mapping remote volcanoes that are 
frequently
masked by clouds and long polar nights (Rowland et al., 1994), and
paleo-drainage features in deserts (McCauley et al., 1982).<p>
<p>
Almost all solid Earth sciences studies benefit from knowledge of topography,
where the required resolution depends on the specific study, but generally in
the range of 25-30 m spatial and 2-5 m vertical (<a
href="fig6.1.gif">Figure 6-1</a>).  The measurement of topography and
topographic change with orbital radars has been demonstrated in a few 
limited
cases (<a href="fig6.2.gif">Figure 6-2</a>), but in general this
technique is still in its infancy and only limited research has been done on
the validation of the data sets.  With the exception of a one year time-series
for the Landers earthquake in California (Massonnet et al., 1994), no long-
term
studies of ground deformation have been done with radar interferometry.
However, we know from GPS measurements made at permanent sites (e.g., <a
href="fig6.3.gif">Figure 6-3</a>) that surface displacements at rates
of ~3 cm/yr. can occur in volcanic and tectonic environments.  Topographic 
data
can be used to calculate local slopes (<a href="fig6.4.gif">Figure
6-4</a>), the volumes of landforms (e.g., volcanic cones, river valleys,
or sand dunes).  Surface displacement may take place due to the rupture of a
fault line or the growth of a volcano.  In Solid Earth science it is the
measurement of topography and topographic change that we consider to be 
NASA's
role in imaging radars; these topics are the most innovative and
technologically challenging, while at the same time they also offer the
greatest scientific advances.<p>
<p>
Radar also offers geologic information on surface properties through the
strength of the back scattered radiation at whatever combination is used of
frequency, incidence angle, and polarization state.  The greatest degree of
information is obtained with multiple frequencies, incidence angles, and the
full Stokes scattering matrix (van Zyl, 1989).  This extensive information is
important in studies of surficial deposits and materials because it allows
characterization of the scattering process and separation of dielectric
constant from textural parameters.  The multi-frequency component of radar
studies in deserts is important because the different wavelengths penetrate to
different depths beneath the surface, thereby providing a crude 3-D view of
buried drainage basins in areas such as the Sahara Desert.<p>
<p>
Scattering information is important in studies of surficial materials and
processes in vegetated areas, e.g., recovery of scoured and sand-covered areas
from the 1993 midwestern U.S. floods.  In this latter case, herbaceous grasses
are encroaching on the affected areas, as are stands of cottonwoods.
Multi-temporal polarimetric SAR at C, L, and P bands allow mapping of the
vegetation density and character, and show how the underlying surfaces are
changing by wind and water-related processes  (see Chapter 2-Ecology). <p>

THEMES
</a><p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC71">Topographic
Mapping and Crustal Motions
</a><p>
<p>
Considerable excitement has been generated by interferometric SAR
investigations of the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (e.g., Massonnet et
al., 1993; Zebker et al., 1994).  Indeed the detection and quantitative
investigation of ground deformations resulting from an earthquake or a 
volcano
holds great promise for the Earth science community (Mouginis-Mark, 1994).  
The
ability to use orbital radars for topographic mapping and topographic change
detection is viewed as the single most important role that a new U.S. radar
mission could play, not withstanding other important contributions that the
data from such a system could provide for regional mapping and quantitative
studies of surface backscatter characteristics.<p>
<p>
Topographic data have been generated by combining data for Long Valley,
California, from the SRL-1 and SRL-2 missions (<a
href="fig6.2.gif">Figure 6-2</a>).  In this instance, the radar
interferometric data can be used to aid in the visualization of geologic
features such as mountain ranges and fault zones.  The topographic data 
derived
by radar interferometry are also inherently more useful than data derived 
from
stereo air photography because the derived digital elevation model (DEM) is
self-consistent.  Moreover, the interferometry technique works well in areas 
of
low topographic relief where classical stereo methods tend to fail because tie
points cannot be identified.  <p>
<p>
To develop topographic change maps requires an additional level of knowledge 
of
the surface and local meteorology.  A preliminary comparison of SRL-1 and 
SRL-2
data at the Kilauea, Hawaii volcano area (obtained in April and October 1994)
shows variations in phase at a scale of 20-50 km (<a
href="fig6.5.gif">Figure 6-5</a>) that are currently interpreted as
anomalies due to the local weather.  This effect is more clearly seen in data
collected during the last four days of the SRL-2 mission.  Here, phase
variations equivalent to surface displacement of a few centimeters appear on
successive days, but are absent when data two or three days apart are viewed
(<a href="fig6.6.gif">Figure 6-6</a>).  Although parts of the
surface can be seen to be entirely decorrelated due to the eruption of new lava
flows (<a href="fig6.7.gif">Figure 6-7</a>), the regional trends in
phase shift (<a href="fig6.6.gif">Figure 6-6</a>) have the
morphology and size that are typical of rain cells in this area.  Thus, local
meteorology may have an important influence on the analysis of radar
interferometry data.  Such effects cannot be avoided, but they can be
quantified by the use of a GPS array on the ground to provide the wet
atmosphere delay, or by the inter-comparison of several radar scenes collected
in a period of about 1 week.<p>
<p>
An important difference in approach to the exploitation of the radar
interferometry method for studying ground deformation exists within the 
Solid
Earth Panel.  For dry environments, it is clear that the 3-day repeat orbit of
ERS-1 was very useful as a demonstration of radar interferometry over arid
areas and dry glaciers.  This very short time meant that radar data could be
correlated even in vegetated regions.  In regions where fast growing 
vegetation
is found, a time gap of 8 days appears to be the longest interval between
observations that can be tolerated.  However, unpublished work by Zebker et 
al.
(1993) with ERS-1 data for volcanoes in Alaska has failed to produce the radar
correlation even using 3-day repeat coverage.  Snow and ice, and potentially
wind disturbing the surface, conspire to prevent ERS-1 data being used in this
setting.  In addition, the 23deg. incidence angle produces severe lay-over on
steep topography.  In arid zones, however, the 35-day repeat period (achieved
during the non-ice mapping phase of the ERS-1 mission) and much longer 
repeat
cycles are tolerable for interferometry.  An ERS-1 quality radar is adequate to
detect such movements, provided that before- and after-event images are
available.  Furthermore, while the 3-day repeat of ERS-1 is useful for
interferometry experiments, this mode of operation is a compromise 
concerning
coverage and repetition.  Only a small percentage of the Earth is covered in
the 3-day repeat mode (~10% coverage compared to that achieved with the 35-
day
repeat).  In addition, the "ice mapping phases" of ERS-1 have been limited to
the period between January and March, so that the interferometry coverage
available for other parts of the world may not have the appropriate temporal
coverage.  The ability to collect topographic data from radar interferometry in
one pass using a pair of antennas (which is the method used in the TOPSAR
airborne system) is an excellent way to avoid the problems of temporal
decorrelation of the surface: the interferogram is constructed from data
collected in a single pass.  There are exciting possibilities in using a
boom-mounted second antenna on the Space Shuttle to collect near-global
topography during a single mission (SRL-3).  This technique is described in
more detail below.<p>
<p>
Numerous issues remain regarding the type of radar observations that are 
needed
to enable radar interferometry experiments to be successful.  Unless a
two-antenna interferometer is flown, the temporal frequency of the repeat-
pass,
the errors due to ionospheric perturbations and atmospheric water vapor, and
the surface characteristics are all believed to be important.  None of these
issues have been rigorously investigated.  We can draw on the experience with
the ERS-1 and SIR-C/X-SAR missions to make some recommendations for the 
use of
future radars, including the possible reflight of SIR-C/X-SAR as SRL-3.
However, it is clear that a combination of orbital radar observations and GPS
measurements in the field are both required for geodynamics and topographic
analyses for two reasons.  First, as was demonstrated with the analysis of the
Landers earthquake data (Zebker et al., 1994), the radar-derived deformation
map provides only line-of-sight changes with poor temporal resolution.  GPS
data from well monumented sites are needed to provide the 3-axis ground
movement and to provide a continuous record of ground deformation against 
which
the radar data can compared.  Second, the neutral atmosphere will have a
significant effect on the radar interferometry because the moisture in the
atmosphere can induce a time delay equivalent to ground movement up to ~30 
cm,
which is far in excess of the ground movement that is typically expected along
fault lines (except during catastrophic rupture) or dormant volcanoes.  New
techniques have been developed that use the time delay information contained
within the GPS signal to determine the water vapor content of the atmosphere
(Bevis and Bussinger, 1994 unpublished data).  If such measurements were to 
be
obtained concurrent with imaging radar data for an interferometry 
experiment,
it would be possible to remove this uncertainty in the resultant radar
deformation map.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC72">Regional
Mapping
</a><p>
<p>
There is considerable interest in the geology community for a radar mission
that is devoted to mapping as much of the Earth's surface as possible.  Radar's
ability to penetrate thin sand layers in desert environments has been known
since the first Shuttle radar experiment (SIR-

A)
back in 1981.  In desert environments, the applications of a radar (whether
multi-wavelength and polarization or single wavelength and polarization) are
numerous, and include ground water hydrology (both its development and
remediation), mineral exploration (including deposits of economic value such 
as
gravels and clays), paleo-drainage mapping that can serve as indicators of
climate change, and archeological research (<a href="fig6.8.gif">Figure
6-8</a>).  In many other types of geologic settings, comparable mapping
mode radar data would also serve to characterize the Earth's environment for
comparison with future radar and (in areas that are not frequently cloud
covered) Landsat data.  In this way, a radar data base would be established
that is equivalent to the 20-year record of Landsat images, except that many
new areas, such as Indonesia, West Africa, and the Kurile/Aleutian Arc would 
be
imaged.  <p>
<p>
This approach could be particularly beneficial for inter-disciplinary studies
related to glaciers and the hydrologic cycle.  Preliminary results for the two
SIR-C/X-SAR experiments have shown that numerous features associated with
glaciers in the Andes can all be mapped.  Through the identification of
moraines, pressure ridges, outflow channels, and the snouts of the ice sheets
as a function of time, the water balance of the glacier can be determined.
This in turn helps in the analysis of the hydrology of the region and has
importance for the analysis of climate change, since the glaciers are sensitive
indicators of the net loss or build-up of ice due to changes in the local
climate.<p>
<p>
In each of these instances, it is hard to argue for the need for a new U.S.
radar.  The issue is really one of regional data coverage, rather than the
specific attributes of a SIR-C/X-SAR class radar.  Many parts of the world have
not been imaged by radar because the ERS-1 spacecraft lacks a tape recorder,
and so has to rely on a series of ground stations for direct broadcast of the
data.  With the advent of RADARSAT in 1995, such a limitation will disappear.
In addition, it would be far more economically practical, if the community 
were
to rely on ERS-1 and its successor ERS-2, to establish new ground stations
(which cost <1% of a new satellite) to capture additional data over parts of
the world where radar data are currently lacking.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC73">Quantitative
Lithologic Mapping with SAR
</a><p>
<p>
The effects of long- and short-term geologic processes on the Earth's surface
are expressed as gross compositional (lithological) differences between rock
types, as more subtle within-lithology variation (sedimentary facies,
sedimentary structures, facies migration, igneous phases, and hydrothermal
alteration), as weathering products and soils, and ultimately as differences in
the geomorphic configuration of the land surface (Sparks, 1971).  Lithologic
mapping potentially can provide information crucial to diverse issues such as
desertification, natural resources (oil and gas, minerals, and water); and
natural hazards such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and environmental
contamination.<p>
<p>
Traditionally, optical remote sensing has been used to directly characterize
lithology on the basis of composition.  There are numerous successful case
studies in the published literature.  Most of these studies, however, only
consider composition at the molecular level, and do not take into account the
gross geomorphology of the surfaces being studied.  In addition,
single-frequency SAR data has long contributed to structural and geomorphic
mapping (see Sabins, 1987, for examples).  Approaches for the extraction of
lithological information usually consist of photo interpretation (including
stereoscopic viewing when available).  While lithology typically can not be
mapped directly without additional information, photogeologic methods still
present one of the most valuable approaches towards extracting geologic
information from radar data.<p>
<p>
The new generation of polarimetric, multi-frequency SARs such as the JPL 
AIRSAR
and SIR-C/X-SAR systems, provide more powerful tools for extracting 
lithologic
information from radar data and for supplementing optical remote sensing
determinations of lithology.  Because SAR systems interact with the Earth's
surface on the 1 to 100+ cm scale, rather than the molecular scale, direct
mapping of lithology based on composition is not possible (Elachi, 1987).
Radar return is primarily controlled by the relationship between the radar
wavelength and the scale of surface roughness with respect to the radar 
signal
(cm-scale relief).  Fortunately, the surface morphology of geologic materials
is often related to the composition and weathering characteristics of the
materials forming the surface.  <a href="fig6.9.gif">Figure 6-9
</a>shows an example of this, where the roughness of alluvial fan
surfaces may be related to the parent materials and the climatic conditions
under which the fans formed.  If a fan has an average vertical relief of 6 cm,
then it might appear smooth (dark) to an L-Band radar system or rough 
(bright)
to an X-band system.  Additionally, the multi-frequency nature of these 
systems
allows for theoretical modeling and extraction of quantitative surface
roughness based on inversion of the models.  Several investigators have used
AIRSAR data and model inversions to identify areas with varying surface
roughness (van Zyl, 1989; van Zyl et al., 1991; Evans et al., 1992;
Kierein-Young, 1993; Kierein-Young and Kruse, 1992).  The multiple 
wavelengths
acquired by the AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR systems are critical to successful
lithologic mapping using surface roughness parameters, and such an analysis
would not be possible with any of the current or planned foreign radar
systems.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC74">Analysis
of Geomorphic Processes
</a><p>
<p>
Quad-pol radar data are also needed to investigate the relationship between
radar backscatter and aerodynamic roughness.  Although the original 
motivation
for this study was the analysis of sand and dust transport (still valid), the
method can also be extended to include climate modeling.  In particular,
general circulation models (GCMs) currently use only 2 or 3 (e.g., land and
ocean) values of aerodynamic roughness, simply because there have been no 
easy
means for getting good values.  Yet Sud et al. (1988) have shown that by adding
more values (e.g., land, ocean, and desert), GCM predictions change drastically
in terms of precipitation, wind regime, etc.  Consequently, the work of Greeley
and coworkers holds promise as a technique for mapping large areas to derive
aerodynamic roughness values for input to the next generation of general
circulation models.<p>
<p>
The ability of wind to initiate dust and sand storms is dependent on the
roughness of the surface at the sub-meter scale, measured by the aerodynamic
roughness (Z0).  This parameter is a measure of the drag imposed by the 
surface
on the wind and is therefore important also in general circulation models
(GCMs).  For dry, unvegetated and relatively flat surfaces, the radar
backscatter coefficient (sigma-0) is a function of surface roughness at a scale
comparable to the radar wavelength.  Studies by Greeley et al. (1988, 1991) and
Blumberg and Greeley (1993) have shown that there is a correlation between
sigma-0 and Z0.  Blumberg and Greeley (1993) developed a model to estimate Z0
from radar backscatter coefficients using AIRSAR data and found that the best
correlation is with L-Band cross-polarized data.  Concurrent measurements 
with
specialized micro-meteorology masts (<a href="fig6.10.gif">Figure
6-10</a>) to measure the wind speed, wind direction, and temperature
through the lower portion of the atmospheric boundary-layer, calibrated data
from SRL-1 for Stovepipe Wells, Death Valley, were analyzed.  These models 
were
then applied to SRL-1 data, and an estimate of Z0 was computed.  Results show
that the models could predict Z0 very closely when using calibrated data (<a
href="fig6.11.gif">Figure 6-11</a>).<p>
<p>
These observations are important because they demonstrate the importance of
obtaining calibrated, multi-wavelength and multi-polarization radar data.  Use
of ERS-1 or RADARSAT data (both C-Band single polarization systems) would 
not
have enabled the same degree of characterization of the eolian roughness of 
the
surface to have been determined.<p>
<p>
Orbital radars have also been used to map river flooding and have been 
recently
demonstrated by Brakenridge et al. (1994).  In late spring and summer of 1993,
the Upper Mississippi River experienced record-setting heavy rainfall.
Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois experienced the wettest June-July period on
record since 1895.  In Iowa, measurable rainfall fell somewhere in the state
for 33 consecutive days from June 22-July 25.  Unusually heavy rains occurred
in July, a month that is more commonly characterized by regional moisture
deficits. <p>
<p>
The radar was used to delineate the flooded agricultural fields along the
valley floor and areas of unflooded agricultural land and flooded riverine
forest.  However, the flood stages determined from ERS-1 scenes lack
close-interval sampling in time, and they are not as accurate as in-situ
recording gages.  The satellite data nevertheless offer an important spatial
perspective for particular moments in time.  Instead of a continuous local
record of rising or falling stage, a single ERS-1 image is a
time-instantaneous, spatially continuous portrait of flood stage along as much
as 100 km of valley reach.  Given favorable flood plain morphology for
measuring flood stage, longitudinal profiles of the instantaneous flood surface
can be constructed.  For this type of investigation, short repeat-time coverage
is crucial.  This coverage might be achieved using different satellites (e.g.,
ERS-2 and RADARSAT) or a spacecraft in a short-repeat orbit (although the 3-
day
repeat of ERS-1 will leave many geographic areas out of the field of view for
this part of the mission).  RADARSAT could also provide rapid site-revisit
capability, provided that the selection of identical viewing geometries is not
a requirement.<p>

COULD A NEW U.S. SAR CONTRIBUTE TO ANSWERING THESE SCIENCE QUESTIONS?
</a><p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC76">Capabilities
of Current Radars
</a><p>
<p>
For many aspects of the Solid Earth research, mapping from single radar 
images
is adequate for the identification of spatial information and general
lithologic characteristics.  Given the continuing series of radars that will be
launched through 2002 (i.e., ERS-2, RADARSAT, ENVISAT ASAR, and ALOS), it 
does
not appear to be cost effective for NASA to fly a comparable radar system.
Increasingly, it is appropriate for U.S. scientists to draw upon international
partners to provide these imaging radar data sets.<p>
<p>
However, these foreign radars have limited capabilities; this means that they
are not ideal for making interferometric measurements for three main 
reasons:<p>
<p>
(1)	The orbital characteristics of these radars are not optimized for the
collection of interferometric data.  No foreign radar is planned that would
perform the single-pass interferometry for topographic mapping 
(comparable to
the ideas for SRL-3 described  below), so that exact-repeat orbits would have
to be used.  In this case, the exact-repeat frequency varies from 3 days (for
selected areas) with the ice-mapping phase of ERS-1 to 24 days for RADARSAT 
and
35 days for the mapping phase of ERS-1.  In the short-term (for about one
year), this situation will improve because of the tandem flight of ERS-1 and
ERS-2.  Exact-repeat coverage will be achieved within one day, but the
site-revisit time, within which a second set of measurements can be made, will
still be either 3 days (limited areas) or 35 days (global coverage).  These
long-repeat times mean that surface decorrelation may take place between
observations (precluding topographic or ground deformation mapping) and 
that
transient events may be missed entirely.  A further issue is that the orbit of
the spacecraft may not be known to sufficient detail that the baseline distance
between successive orbits can be calculated for the interferometry
experiments.<p>
<p>
(2)	Single wavelength/single polarization radars (including all the 
planned
foreign radars) cannot be used to routinely determine surface topography and
topographic change due to the unknown influence of the ionosphere on the
time-delay of the radar signal.  As is the case with VLBI measurements, the
ionospheric delay can be uniquely resolved with two wavelengths.  This effect
can be reduced by collecting the radar data at night, but this would limit the
coverage and site-revisit frequency.  In addition, multi-wavelength
measurements enhance the probability that radar interferometry experiments 
can
be conducted because they allow a wider range of baseline distances to be
considered (X-band measurements require a separation of a few tens of meters,
C-band a few hundred meters, and L-band about 1 km).<p>
<p>
(3)	From the analysis of the SIR-C/X-SAR data, it is clear that for many parts
of the world the cross-pol radar data (at both C-Band and L-Band) are much 
more
useful for the analysis of the surface morphology than like-pol (HH or VV)
data.  No foreign radar has this cross-pol capability, so that lithologic
mapping with ERS-1, RADARSAT, or JERS-1 is more difficult than with
SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
<p>
It is in this context, where no foreign radar is ideal for interferometric
studies, that the idea of flying SRL-3 with an attached boom to conduct
single-pass interferometry is so exciting.  Indeed it is believed that flying
this mission concept would dramatically advance the Earth Science 
Community's
understanding of the planet.  While the details of the capabilities of a
boom-mounted system are still being investigated, the inherent height 
accuracy
of the proposed X-SAR radar interferometer would be better than 5 m vertical 
at
a spatial resolution of 25 m/pixel.  What is truly exciting is the opportunity
to collect an almost <u>global</u> (equator-ward of 62deg.) topographic map
using the wide-swath (SCANSAR) mode, which provides 50 m/pixel resolution 
and a
height accuracy better than 20 m.  In addition, a complete radar image of the
world between 62deg.N-62deg.S would also be obtained, thereby providing a
benchmark data set against which future global change could be measured.  
The
combined use of X-band at high spatial resolution and C-band in SCANSAR 
mode
would enable the quality of the two DEMs to be tested against each other, as
well as provide the regional framework (SIR-C) for detailed local (X-SAR)
studies.<p>
<p>
A major advantage of the SRL-3 topographic mission is that all of the
topographic data would be referenced to a single topographic datum.  Until 
now,
the reference surface for maps from one continent do not match the datum for
another continent (<a href="fig6.12.gif">Figure 6-12</a>).
Particularly for long-wavelength (>1,000 km) studies of the gravity field
and structure of the Earth, it is crucial to use a common datum (typically the
geoid).  The SRL-3 data would naturally be referenced to the Earth's geoid.
Thus, a whole new range of geophysical and geodynamics studies would be
possible that currently cannot be rigorously attempted.<p>
<p>
It is our opinion that there is a major leadership role that NASA can play by
flying the SRL-3 mission using a second boom-mounted antenna to perform
single-pass interferometry.  The data set so collected could be one of the most
valuable and widely used data sets NASA has <u>ever</u> collected, and would
serve as a benchmark data sets for decades to come.  In particular, this data
set would meet and <u>exceed</u> NASA's commitment to provide a global digital
topographic data base in support of the Earth Observing System (EOS) with the
added bonus that these data could be made available to the community prior to
the launch of the EOS A.M.-1 platform.  Synergism between the topographic 
data
set and other information (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, ASTER images) would greatly
facilitate studies dedicated to hydrology, ecology and land use.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC77">Development
of a New U.S. Radar Satellite
</a><p>
<p>
Development of the future U.S. radar system should be seen as incremental in
implementation, starting from the existing aircraft TOPSAR system and the 
SRL-2
interferometry experiments, and ultimately leading to a long-duration
free-flyer.  Logical steps to achieve this goal are:<p>
<p>
(1)	Continue the experimental studies of radar interferometry for 
topographic
mapping using the aircraft TOPSAR system.  Much remains to be understood 
about
the accuracy of topographic measurements at the meter to tens of meter scale,
and the effects of different ground covers (e.g., vegetation vs. bare rock) and
regional slopes.  A comparison between the topography determined at more 
than
one wavelength (including the effects of atmospheric water vapor on the time
delay of the signal) can best be investigated under the controlled conditions
of the TOPSAR experiments.  In addition, the science community needs a
short-term data source to develop expertise in the analysis of high spatial
resolution topographic data sets.<p>
<p>
(2)	The use of a boom-mounted antenna on the SRL-3 Shuttle mission.  As
described above, this new technology provides the capability to map the 
Earth's
topography (and provide an image) for all the land between 62deg.N and 
62deg.S
using single-pass interferometry.<p>
<p>
(3)	A free-flying radar could be constructed from the existing SIR-C/X-SAR
hardware, and placed into orbit by the Shuttle for a 1-2 year mission.  This
mission concept has the advantage that most of the radar technology has 
already
been developed, but the disadvantages are that the orbital inclination will be
57deg. due to the Shuttle launch, and the altitude will be relatively low
(resulting in a short-duration mission).  However, this orbit enables the
ascending and descending orbits of the Shuttle to observe the same point on 
the
ground from almost orthogonal aspect angles.  The complete 3-D topography 
could
therefore be mapped: Slopes will be well determined in at least one of the two
pairs of scenes.  This capability will not be available through the ERS-1 and
ERS-2 spacecraft because the near-polar orbits means that the ascending and
descending ground tracks intersect at narrow angles.<p>
<p>
(4)	The ultimate goal should be to launch a free-flying radar into a near 
polar
(for global coverage) with a short (<3 day) exact repeat orbit for rapid
site-revisit capability.  This system would augment the data base collected by
the SRL-3 mission or, alternatively, if SRL-3 is not flown, would establish a
baseline topographic data set in its own right.  The key difference would be
that the coverage would be global as the spacecraft would be placed in a polar
orbit, and that the spatial resolution would be uniformly high (as opposed to
some areas having the 50 m/pixel coverage provided by SIR-C operating in
SCANSAR mode).<p>
<p>
In order to avoid surface decorrelation, this free-flying radar should have two
antennas so that single-pass interferometry can be achieved.  The parameters 
of
this radar should include at least two different wavelengths (to compensate for
the ionosphere) and have a variable incidence angle (to permit rapid
retargeting of the antenna, as well as reduce lay-over in areas of high
topography).  Mission duration should be at least 3 years to enable the
derivation of a global topographic map followed by monitoring for ground
deformation at selected sites.<p>
<p>
This mission concept, with two antennas flying on co-orbital platforms, has a
great advantage.  Interferometry experiments can be conducted for the Solid
Earth investigations, and the same spacecraft can also be flown to conduct
along-track interferometry that will be of great value for the analysis of
ocean surface phenomena.  We therefore see strong synergism between the 
Solid
Earth Sciences/Topography and Marine Applications recommendations.<p>
<p>
<p><hr size=5>

<a name="RTFToC78">RECOMMENDATIONS</a><p>
<p>
(1)	Flying SRL-3 with a boom-mounted second antenna to perform single-
pass
topographic mapping would not only produce a quantum leap in our 
understanding
of the world's topography, but would also represent a significant technological
challenge in radar interferometry.  To have the greatest value, SRL-3 should
include both X-band and C-

band
interferometers to collect high and low resolution data, respectively.  It is
clear that the imaging data will also have great long-term value for global
change studies, independent of the topographic mapping.  This mission 
concept
offers outstanding possibilities for enhancing NASA's standing in the
international radar community at relatively low cost and in a short time frame
(the SRL-3 mission could fly within two years).<p>
<p>
(2)	Continue to fly the NASA airborne TOPSAR/AIRSAR.  This airborne 
system is
crucial for continued interferometry algorithm development; the TOPSAR 
hardware
is seen as the vital test-bed to develop new interferometric techniques that
ultimately will be tried on spaceborne systems.<p>
<p>
(3)	NASA needs to support a vigorous data analysis program using the SRL-2
exact-repeat data set.  Data obtained during the last four days of the mission
will enable proof-of-concept studies in interferometry over an adequate 
variety
of targets.  More importantly, different radar baselines and the effects of
local meteorology on the phase data can be investigated with this short-repeat
coverage.<p>
<p>
(4)	Utilize data from non-US radar systems to pursue science objectives to 
the
extent that these systems acquire relevant measurements, cause they will be
there and we can do some good science.  This capability would be significantly
enhanced if there are additional ground stations established around the world
to take advantage of the tandem mission of ERS-1 and ERS-2.  A crucial
component of this work with foreign radars is the need for a U.S. investigator
team to be funded to work with the data.<p>
<p>
(5)	NASA should begin to build a free-flyer satellite with interferometric
capability and cross-polarization and multiple incidence angle (nominally
20-45deg.) capabilities, to maintain U.S. involvement in unique and important
ways.  Results from this type of experiment promise to revolutionize several
fields of study related to topography and topographic change.  Single-pass
interferometry is seen as the only way to avoid meteorological errors in the
phase data, and a two wavelength SAR is needed to remove ionospheric effects.
This same instrument has a very high probability of making quantum leaps in 
our
understanding of Solid Earth and Oceanography sciences, as well as serving as
an excellent tool for hazard mitigation studies.<p>
<p>
Part of such a mission should have strong international participation so that
more than one spacecraft could be used to reduce the time interval between
observations.  A significant component of such a mission could be dedicated to
disaster-monitoring once a baseline data set has been constructed.  The ability
of the radar to have a wide swath width (up to 500 km at degraded spatial
resolution) and the capability to image any point on the Earth's surface
through the use of a steerable antenna enhances the possibility of imaging 
the
surface during the event (such as river flooding), rather than just obtaining
data once the physical process is over.<p>

<a name="RTFToC80">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
<p>
To support the scientific applications utilizing spaceborne imaging radar
systems, a set of radar technologies has been identified which can 
dramatically
lower the weight, volume, power and data rates of the radar systems.  These
smaller and lighter SAR systems can be readily accommodated in small 
spacecraft
and launch vehicles enabling significantly reduced total mission costs.  To
prioritize the technology needs, a strawman mission scenario is adopted.  It
includes global topography mapping missions using interferometric SARs and 
dual
frequency, polarimetric SAR mapping missions that will be flown starting in
2000.  Specific areas of radar technology include the antenna, RF electronics,
digital electronics and data processing.  A core radar technology development
plan is recommended to develop and demonstrate these technologies and 
integrate
them into the radar missions in a timely manner.  It is envisioned that these
technology advances can revolutionize the approach to SAR missions leading 
to
higher performance systems at significantly reduced mission costs.<p>
<p>
NASA has flown several spaceborne imaging radar missions for Earth 
observation,
starting with the pioneering L-band SAR system that flew on the SEASAT 
mission
in 1978 (Jordan, 1980).  This series of spaceborne SARs has provided an
increasing level of system capability, culminating in the SIR-C/X-SAR system
(IEEE, 1991).  This latest system is the first multi-frequency, polarimetric
SAR system designed for Earth observations from space.  It flew successfully 
on
two shuttle missions in April and October of 1994.  An extensive data set was
collected over numerous experiment sites around the globe.  The
multi-frequency, polarimetric radar measurements will be used to address
scientific investigations in the areas of geology, hydrology, ecology,
oceanography and other disciplines.<p>
<p>
<a href="fig7.1.gif">Figure 7-1</a> summarizes the key features of
the series of four spaceborne SAR systems developed and flown by NASA for 
Earth
observations.  It also summarizes the key radar system technology features,
such as frequency, polarization, transmitter/receiver approach and beam
steering capability.  In addition to these NASA systems, several other
spaceborne SAR missions are being conducted by the international 
community.
Examples of three such systems developed by ESA, Japan, and Canada are 
shown in
<a href="fig7.2a.gif">Figure 7-2a</a>.  The key system technology
features of these international SAR systems are shown in <a
href="fig7.2b.gif">Figure 7-2b</a> (IEEE, 1991).  The potential
applications of measurements from all these radar missions in a wide range of
Earth science disciplines are given in previous segments of this report.<p>
<p>
In support of the spaceborne SAR missions throughout the past two decades, 
NASA
has also been conducting airborne SAR experiments to develop geophysical
algorithms to convert the radar measurements to quantitative geophysical
parameters.  The airborne SAR system was also used to demonstrate advanced
radar system concepts such as the interferometric SAR technique (Zebker et 
al.,
1986).  The feasibility of obtaining high resolution digital topography data
using this technique has been thoroughly demonstrated on numerous 
airborne
experiments.  Furthermore, this technique has recently been extended to 
measure
minute topography changes by the differences in the interferometric SAR
measurements obtained in multiple passes over the experiment sites (Gabriel 
et
al., 1989).  The error sources associated with these techniques are now well
characterized, and a logical next step is to apply them to global measurements
from space (Zebker et al., 1994).<p>
<p>
To assist the planning of the next phase of activities for spaceborne SARs,
especially in view of the fact that there are several other SAR programs that
are ongoing in the international community, NASA has requested the National
Research Council to conduct a review of the future SAR program direction.  A
key concern for any future SAR mission is that the mission complexity and 
cost
are often driven by the mass, power, volume and data rate requirements of the
radars.  Typically, these radars demand large resources from the spacecraft as
well as the launch vehicles, leading to high mission costs.  An aggressive
program to develop key radar technologies for smaller, lighter SAR systems 
that
are more readily accommodated in small spacecraft/launch vehicles can lead 
to
significantly reduced total mission costs.  This portion of the review report
addresses the specific questions concerning SAR technology and a plan for
technology development for SAR program needs.  An ad hoc SAR Technology 
Working
Group to support this review was formed.  The specific question that this
segment of the report addresses is:  "What are the priorities in SAR technology
development which are critical not only to NASA's maintaining leadership in
spaceborne SAR technology but to providing societally relevant geophysical
parameters?" This segment summarizes the findings of the SAR Technology 
Working
Group and recommends specific, prioritized technology steps for the NASA SAR
program.<p>

<a name="RTFToC81">SCIENCE
PANEL NEEDS SUMMARY
</a><p>
<p>
The scientific application drivers for SAR measurements have been described 
in
detail in previous segments of this report and are summarized below:<p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Geology:</b> topography and topographic changes; hazard 
assessment such
as flood potential, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc.<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>Oceanography:</b> ocean currents, winds, ocean surface features, sea 
ice
thickness and coastal processes;<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Hydrology: </b> soil moisture and snow water equivalence;<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Ecology:</b>  land cover classification, inundation mapping and 
biomass
measurements;<p>
<p>
(5)	<b>Ice sheets:</b>  snow facies, seasonal melt, icebergs, surface
morphology, ice velocity and surface topography.<p>
<p>
In each of these areas, the contributions of SAR data to the geophysical
measurements are also addressed by other segments in this report.  In some
cases, the SAR systems provide a unique capability for the measurements of 
the
geophysical parameters.  In other cases, the radar results are combined with
other sensor data for the geophysical studies.  All the review panels 
recommend
the collection of a long-term, calibrated time series of SAR data for studies
of environmental changes.  The next section focuses on translating these
science drivers and their associated requirements of the SAR systems into a
strawman mission scenario.  Based on these SAR system requirements and 
mission
needs, recommendations on a technology program are given in the Radar 
System
Technology Discussions sub-section below.<p>

<a name="RTFToC82">STRAWMAN
SAR MISSION SCENARIO
</a><p>
<p>
In order to focus the science application drivers summarized in the Science
Panel Needs Summary section into SAR system requirements, we have 
constructed a
strawman spaceborne SAR mission scenario.  This strawman scenario 
addresses the
key scientific needs, as advocated in the science panel reports, and the data
to address those needs which are not presently available from the planned
international radar programs.  The scenario includes a global topography
mapping mission and a dual frequency, multi-polarization global mapping 
SAR
mission.  The global topography mission utilizes the interferometric SAR
technique for high resolution, digital topography mapping.  The dual-
frequency,
polarimetric SAR mission focuses on medium-resolution mapping of 
geophysical
parameters such as biomass and soil moisture, and provides high resolution
regional-scale measurements for selected experiment studies.  Data from this
mission scenario, together with data from other international SARs, will
provide the comprehensive, long-term data set that is required to address all
the science application issues discussed above.  This strawman scenario clearly
identifies the NASA contribution to the international SAR programs and 
provides
key measurements that will otherwise be unavailable.  It is recognized that the
mission scenario described is, indeed, a strawman.  Significant interactions
with the science community, the international SAR mission program planners 
and
NASA are required to properly define the mission scenario.  However, for the
purpose of this report, this strawman scenario and an assumed schedule for 
the
execution of this scenario will serve as guides for the identification of radar
technology needs.<p>
<p>
<a href="fig7.3.gif">Figure 7-3</a> shows a schematic drawing of a
strawman concept for the global topography mapping mission.  This concept
utilizes two L-band SAR spacecraft that fly in formation.  The formation flying
will generate the required interferometric baseline separation between the 
two
SAR antennas.  The physical separation of the interferometric baseline needs 
to
be measured to an accuracy of a few mm; the strawman approach is to utilize
differential GPS signals.  The performance characteristics of the SAR is also
shown in <a href="fig7.3.gif">Figure 7-3</a>.  Radar echoes
obtained from the two systems will be processed into SAR imagery.  The 
imagery
will then be coherently combined and the interferometric phase 
measurements
will be extracted.  These phase measurements are then converted into digital
topography information based on the baseline knowledge and other geometric
parameters.  Data from multiple orbits will be mosaicked to form a global
topography model.  It is expected that this global digital elevation model will
have horizontal posting of about 30 m and vertical height accuracy of 2 to 5 m.
This global data set will represent a major improvement in resolution beyond
topography information that is currently available.  It should be noted that
this mission concept can be readily extended to perform measurements of
topography changes using multiple passes over selected regions with nearly
repeat ground tracks.  As mentioned above, this technique has been 
demonstrated
before using similar data sets (Zebker et al., 1994).  It is envisioned that
topography change detection and measurements need to be conducted on a
continuing basis for assessment of hazards and related environmental 
changes.
The key technology driver for a set of low-cost topography mapping missions 
is
to develop a small, light  SAR system that can be accommodated in small
spacecraft and launch vehicles.<p>
<p>
<a href="fig7.4.gif">Figure 7-4</a> shows a schematic drawing for a
dual-frequency, polarimetric strawman SAR mission for global vegetation and
soil moisture studies.  An L-band SAR with quad-linear polarization, together
with an X-band SAR with dual polarization, is assumed for this mission.  The
focus of this mission is on obtaining medium resolution (200 to 300 m) global
maps at the L- and X-bands for ecological and hydrological system studies.  The
specific geophysical measurements include biomass estimates, vegetation
classification, plus soil and snow moisture.  The mission goal is to provide a
global map of these measurements once every several days for assessments of
changes in these geophysical quantities.  It is also envisioned that the SAR
systems can support observations at higher resolution (less than 20 m) over
selected areas for regional-scale experiment studies.  This system employs
advanced on-board SAR signal processing to generate the medium-resolution,
accurately calibrated polarimetric SAR imagery over the global land mass.  
This
technology will reduce the on-board data storage and downlink requirements.  
In
addition, a small, lightweight power-efficient SAR system is also required. <p>
<p>
A recent interesting SAR technique development is the use of an along-track
interferometric SAR system for measurements of ocean phenomena, especially
ocean currents.  We note that a possible mission concept for along-track
interferometric SAR ocean studies is similar to <a
href="fig7.3.gif">Figure 7-3</a>, except that, instead of flying
side-by-side, the spacecraft will fly along-track relative to each other.  This
approach does not require significant technology changes relative to the
strawman mission scenario.<p>
<p>
As a basis for planning and prioritizing the SAR technology development, we
have arbitrarily selected an assumed schedule for the two missions mentioned.
We have assumed that the global topography mapping mission will be 
developed in
the 1997 to 2000 time frame with a launch in 2000 and the dual-frequency,
polarimetric SAR mission for global mapping will be developed in the 2000 to
2003 time frame with a launch in 2003.  Of course, this schedule needs to be
reexamined in the future, but it will serve to set the requirements for the
technology development.<p>

<a name="RTFToC83">RADAR
SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY DISCUSSIONS
</a><p>
<p>
In this section, the state of the art in spaceborne SAR system technology, as
well as the technology needed to address future potential missions are
discussed.  The five main areas of discussions are: antenna, RF electronics,
digital electronics, data processors and system-level technology concepts.  For
each of these areas, the projected technology needs and their impact on the 
SAR
missions are described.  As discussed in the Recommended SAR Technology 
Program
Approach section below, an advanced radar test-bed should be developed.  Each
of the technology items discussed should be fully tested in a modular fashion
within this test-bed.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC84">Antenna
Technology Discussions
</a><p>
<p>
It is recognized that a key technology challenge in SAR systems is the antenna
system.  Due to the desire to limit the level of azimuth and range ambiguities
in the SAR signal, the physical size of the antenna used cannot be smaller 
than
certain prescribed limits.  A typical size for a spaceborne L-band SAR antenna
is 10 x 2 m.  An antenna of similar size will be required for the strawman
missions.  <a href="tab7.1.gif">Table 7-1 </a> summarizes the size and weight
of the antenna systems used in the SAR systems on SEASAT, ERS-1, JERS-1,
RADARSAT and SIR-C (Gibbons, et al., 1994; Jordan, 1980).  Although the
physical size requirements do change with frequency, orbit altitude, swath
width and required antenna gain, the antennas listed in <a
href="tab7.1.gif">Table 7-1 </a> are all large and represent challenges in
accommodation for the spacecraft and launch vehicle.  These antenna systems
also use different technology approaches.  The SIR-C/X-SAR system utilizes a
distributed phased array antenna at the L- and C-bands, and a slotted 
waveguide
antenna at the X-band (<a href="fig7.5.gif">Figure 7-5</a>).  The
L- and C-band phased arrays employ multiple transmit/receive (T/R) modules 
that
are distributed across the physical apertures of the antennas.  These
distributed T/R modules also provide electronic beam-steering capability.  The
ERS-1 and RADARSAT SAR systems utilize slotted waveguide antennas at the
C-band, and the JERS-1 SAR system utilizes a microstrip planar array at the
L-band.  For the strawman mission scenario described in the Strawman SAR
Mission Scenario section above, the key technology challenges for the 
antennas
required are: reduction in the antenna weight, accommodation of a large 
antenna
within the envelope of the launch vehicle shroud, reliability of the 
deployment
mechanism, and reduction in the loss through the antenna feed network.<p>
<p>
For the mission to be launched in 2000, a lightweight antenna with a minimal
stowed volume to fit within a small launch vehicle shroud is required.  The use
of light weight composite material to reduce the antenna weight and maintain
the required surface flatness is a key technology.  Compact deployable 
antenna
structures, with highly reliable deployment mechanisms, need further
development and demonstration.  Improvements in low loss feed network 
material
technology are desired.  As a target for this phase, a passive, L-band planar
antenna system with a size of 12 x 2 m that is suitable for the global
topography mapping mission should weigh less than 70 kg.  In addition, it is
also possible to consider using the antenna structure in the SAR system as an
additional resource for the spacecraft.  For example, the antenna structure can
serve as an integral part of the spacecraft structure, which can be used for
the mounting of other spacecraft subsystems.  This aspect should be
investigated in the detailed mission design. <p>
<p>
For the missions to be launched in 2003 and beyond, the use of inflatable
antenna technology, in the form of planar phased arrays or other suitable
reflector shapes in SAR antennas, must be developed.  This technology can
provide significant advantages in reducing the volume of the stowed antenna 
at
launch, which will allow SAR systems to fly in smaller launch vehicles.  It can
also reduce the mass of the antenna as well (Freeland et al., 1992).  <a
href="fig7.6.gif">Figure 7-6</a> shows an example of such an
inflatable reflector that is under development for a technology demonstration
flight on the Space Shuttle.  However, several key technological challenges
must be addressed before this approach can be readily adopted for SAR
applications: (1) an appropriate antenna feed approach (if the radiative
elements are on the inflated antenna surface), (2) the design concept to
provide electronic beam-steering, (3) lifetime of the material used, (4)
mechanical control of the antenna, and (5) total system reliability.  In
particular, the incorporation of electronic beam-steering capability with the
required fast beam switching time and low side-lobe level, into an inflatable
structure must be demonstrated.  Another key concern for the global SAR 
mapping
mission is that the inflatable antenna has to support dual-frequency operation
and polarimetric measurements. <p>

Electronics Technology Discussions
</a><p>
<p>
The RF subsystems of spaceborne SARs generate high power microwave 
transmitter
pulses and amplify the radar echoes received through the antenna for
digitization and processing.  A key technology is the high peak power
transmitter that is required.  The SIR-C system utilizes distributed T/R
modules, whereas the X-SAR utilizes a central transmitter/receiver system.  In
the multiple T/R module approach, the total peak transmit power is shared 
among
all the modules, and each one only needs to transmit at a relatively lower peak
power.  Furthermore, the overall system reliability is improved because the
multiple modules provide inherent redundancy.  <a
href="fig7.7.gif">Figure 7-7</a> shows an L-band T/R module used on
SIR-C.  The key technology issues for the RF electronic subsystems for future
SAR missions are substantial reduction in their weight and volumes, and
significant improvement in their power efficiency.  The power efficiency
improvement can lead to reduction in the requirements on the spacecraft 
power
subsystem with corresponding savings in mission cost.  Another concern is to
improve the reliability of these high-power RF components to reduce the risk 
of
sensor failure.  It is also important that the RF electronics operate with
stable system gains to allow accurate calibration of the radar results.<p>
<p>
Specifically, for the global topography mission at 2000, lightweight, highly
efficient solid-state transmitters at the L-band, with peak power in excess of
300 W, are required.  Silicon bipolar transistors at this power level presently
exist for L-band operation, but their power efficiency should be improved
beyond 60%.  In addition to the high-power transmitters, the low-power 
portions
of the RF subsystems, such as the exciters and receivers, should be
miniaturized by the appropriate use of MMIC technology (see schematic 
diagram
in <a href="fig7.8.gif">Figure 7-8</a>).  This can lead to drastic
reduction of system mass and volume.<p>
<p>
For the radar missions through 2010, there are several emerging technologies
that should be incorporated.  Gallium arsenide MESFET and derivatives, such as
heterostructure FETs and pseudomorphic HEMTs, should deliver several tens of
watts at C-band and perhaps X-band (<a href="fig7.9.gif">Figure
7-9</a> shows the present assessment of the available peak power per
single device in various frequencies).  Another example is the microwave 
power
module. This is a blending of solid-state and vacuum electronics with
performance benefits not attainable by either technology alone.  It combines 
a
wideband MMIC driver, an efficient miniaturized vacuum power booster, and
integrated power conditioning, into a compact, lightweight package capable of
average powers from several tens to several hundreds of watts.  It is suitable
for operation at frequencies up to the K-band (where  solid-state  devices  are
not as  efficient as  they  are  at lower frequencies; see <a
href="fig7.10.gif">Figure 7-10 </a>for an engineering model example).
It should also be noted that continuing improvement in high-power 
electronics
tubes are useful for SAR operations at higher frequencies.  Again, in all
cases, further reductions in weight and improvements in power efficiency are
key issues.  For the missions beyond 2000, the technology of performing direct
synthesis of RF drive signal from clock signals, avoiding any frequency
synthesis process, should be pursued.  By delivering the required RF drive
signals by direct synthesis, significant portions of the exciter electronics
will be eliminated, with a corresponding reduction in mass and volume. <p>
<p>
An important challenge in the development of miniaturized RF electronics is 
the
mechanical packaging technology.  The small size in the circuitry presents
significant challenges in minimizing design time, eliminating undesired RF
coupling, and allowing for proper thermal dissipation.  Furthermore, the
small-scale circuitry will present problems in electrical and performance
testing.  New methodologies for testing by non-intrusive probing techniques
should be developed and applied.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC86">Digital
Electronics Technology Discussions
</a><p>
<p>
A significant cost driver for SAR systems is that they typically generate large
volumes of data at high rates.  For example, the SIR-C/X-SAR system has five
radar channels that operate at 45 Mb/s.  For SIR-C, the digital data handling
subsystem was 145 kg in weight and consumed about 800 W of power.  Specific
technology needs in the digital electronics for future SAR systems include
substantial reduction in weight and power consumption, and increased 
automation
of system operation.<p>
<p>
For the global topography mapping mission in 2000, ASIC or FPGA technology
needs to be adopted to reduce the digital electronics system size and weight.
Examples of modules that need to be miniaturized include the digital chirp
generator, data digitizer, the formatter, and the timing and control modules.
Operating at clock rates of 50 to 100 MHz, their power consumption needs to be
reduced by a factor of 10.  Fortunately, the performance of digital
synthesizers, analog-to-digital converters, floating point multipliers and
accumulators, and high speed memories is benefiting from technology
improvements that will lower power consumption and raise clock frequencies.  
In
particular, heterojunction bipolar technology can lead to power consumption
reduction by a factor of 5 and can more than double the operation speeds.  For
example, the sampling rate of 12-bit ADCs are projected to grow from 10 MS/s 
to
over 50 MS/s, and that of 8-bit ADCs from 100 MS/s to 1 GS/s.  At the same
time, scaled CMOS and complementary gallium arsenide heterostructure FET
technology are reducing both the access time and power consumption of 
SRAMs for
high speed applications.  In addition to these technology items, use of the
multi-chip module packaging approach should also be adopted to improve the
packaging volume efficiency and system reliability.  To reduce the cost of
post-launch mission operation, the radar command and operation functions 
should
be highly automated.  The radar system controller must perform the function 
of
detailed system parameter setup; this may vary as a function of the orbital
location (e.g., PRF and data window position) as well as the gain setup of the
RF and IF portions of the radars in an automated fashion to avoid excessive
ground commanding.  Onboard selection of proper RF/IF gain based on the 
radar
echo strength, or the use of adaptive data quantization schemes such as a block
floating point quantizer is required.  These system automation issues will
allow significant reduction in mission operation costs.<p>
<p>
For the radar missions through 2010, the key digital technology item is
on-board SAR processors for missions such as the global vegetation and soil
moisture mapping mission.  Unfortunately, current programs to develop
radiation-hardened processors and memories are lagging behind the 
commercially
available products.  A radiation-hardened, 32-bit, 20-Mips processor is not yet
available, and the current radiation-hardened SRAM technology is 256K.  The
onboard SAR data processor should be small, light and consume relatively low
power (<50 to 100W).  Technology advances in digital signal processing
elements should be explored to develop a compact system architecture that is
capable of the high throughput rate required(>4 GFLOPS at a sustained rate).
This onboard processing technology can lead to dramatic decreases in 
downlink
requirements and subsequent ground data handling.  For the radar missions in
this time period, the technology of very-high-speed ADC to perform direct data
digitization at RFs from 1 to 10 GHz, followed by high-speed digital filters,
should be developed.  This approach will eliminate portions of the traditional
RF subsystem and can potentially lead to more stable system calibration with
improved system dynamic range.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC87">Data
Processing Systems 
</a><p>
<p>
At present, nearly all the spaceborne SAR missions utilize ground data
processing systems to convert the raw radar data into imagery.  The ground
processors also perform radiometric calibration, geometric rectification,
further processing of the imagery into level 2 products, and the data archive
and distribution.  There are three major hardware approaches to the 
development
of SAR processing systems: general commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) CPUs that
can provide multi-GFLOPS level of computation rate; general COTS CPU 
augmented
by special-purpose, high-computation-rate signal processing boards; and
custom-designed, special-purpose SAR processing hardware. <p>
<p>
For the radar mission in 2000, the present technology trend is to continue to
capitalize on the advancement in COTS hardware that the computer industry is
providing, and to utilize highly transportable SAR processing software to
reduce the system implementation cost.  A key technology driver continues to 
be
the front-end interface to the radar data storage input.  Significant
investments to increase the throughput, reliability and transportability of
this front-end I/O interface are required.  Other important technology
developments should occur in high-throughput geophysical product 
generation
systems.  These systems perform geophysical parameter retrieval based on the
SAR imagery and generate higher-level data products.  Although the 
geophysical
inversion algorithms are maturing, the use of high-speed computation 
systems to
analyze large data volumes of SAR need to be demonstrated.  Significant
advances have already been made in the polar ice geophysical processing, and
these system approaches need to be extended to other application areas.  An
issue that should also be addressed is the incorporation of these SAR data
sets, both at the imagery level and higher level data products, into the EOS
data systems, so that they can be readily accessed by the science community.<p>
<p>
For the SAR missions through 2010, as mentioned in the Digital electronics
technology discussions above, the use of onboard processors should allow the
generation of SAR imagery on the spacecraft.  Continuing improvements of
onboard processors should be pursued by including the radiometric and 
geometric
calibration functions that require engineering information provided with the
radar sensor.  In addition to the continuing improvements in the onboard
processor systems, further improvements in the higher level product 
generation
system technology and the development of efficient data product verification
processes need to be performed. <p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC88">Other
SAR System Technology Considerations
</a><p>
<p>
In the discussions on the science application drivers and the strawman 
mission
scenario, the radar resolution is typically envisioned to be in the range of
tens to hundreds of meters.  Indeed, the global mapping of vegetation and soil
moisture will be conducted with a resolution of 200 to 300 m.  However, for
certain applications, a high resolution data set, say, at 2 m, can provide
significant advantages.  For example, once an area of interest is mapped at low
resolution, selected segments of that area can be mapped at higher resolution
for more detailed studies.  These high-resolution data may have commercial 
and
other civilian and military applications beyond the scientific studies
discussed here.  The high resolution mapping would not be global in nature, 
but
would focus on selected regions for detailed studies.  This type of high
resolution mapping should be considered for the global topography mapping
mission, as well as for the dual-frequency, polarimetric SAR mapping mission.
Continuing improvements in the radar sensor technology, especially in high 
peak
transmit power, large system operation bandwidth and high resolution 
onboard
signal processors, would be required.<p>
<p>
Although many of the scientific studies have been using radar measurements
obtained over distinct frequencies that are widely separated, a tradeoff on the
use of a single wide-band radar system, operating over, say, 40% of the
bandwidth for some of the applications, should be examined.  This wide-band
approach can be readily accommodated in most antenna and RF system
technologies.  It eliminates the use of multiple hardware sets for the distinct
frequencies.  Of course, the penalty is that the frequency separation is only
40% or so of the RF frequency, but that may be sufficient for certain
applications.  The utility of such a system concept should be explored.<p>

<a name="RTFToC89">RECOMMENDED
SAR TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM APPROACH
</a><p>
<p>
It is recommended that an aggressive radar technology development program 
be
incorporated as part of the core NASA radar program activities.  Its primary
purpose is to reduce the mass, power, volume and data rate of the radar systems
in order to reduce the total mission cost.  In addition, prudent adoption of
these technologies in developing the radar instrument and data processing
systems can improve the system performance, increase its reliability, and 
lower
the radar system development cost.  This section summarizes the technology
development discussions in the Radar System Technology Discussions section 
into
a specific SAR technology program that is designed to address the needs for 
the
radar missions envisioned for the 2000s.<p>
<p>
For the radar mission in 2000, an aggressive technology demonstration 
program
is recommended to ensure that the technologies listed in the Radar System
Technology Discussions section above are ready and suitable for incorporation
into the radar mission.  The crucial technology demonstration studies are:<p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Antenna:</b>  a technology demonstration model that includes the 
use of
lightweight composite material for the antenna subarrays, a compact 
deployable
antenna structure with the associated deployment mechanism, and a low loss
antenna feed network using low loss material;<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>RF subsystem:</b>  development of high efficiency solid-state L-band
transmitter module and MMIC-based lightweight exciter and receiver 
modules;<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Digital electronics:</b>  development of miniaturized digital chirp
generator, timing and control module, data digitization and handling unit 
using
ASIC or FPGA technology and appropriate multi-chip module packaging 
approach;<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Data processing systems:</b>  demonstration of high-throughput,
front-end interfaces for the ingestion of radar data into state-of-the-art COTS
hardware system for SAR processing.<p>
<p>
<a href="tab7.2.gif">Table 7-2 </a>shows the projected mass breakdown of such
an advanced SAR system for the global topography mission.  It is envisioned
that the SAR system should weigh less than 100 kg, which represents a factor 
of
3 or more reduction relative to current, similar systems.  A systematic
approach to this technology demonstration process is a radar test-bed in 
which
an advanced technology radar system is built up from all technology
demonstration items.  After each technology item is tested, it will be
integrated into the test-bed for an end-to-end system-level test.  It should be
noted that many of the electronics modules listed above are applicable to
radars at different frequencies, and therefore can be used in radar systems
beyond the first strawman mission in 2000.<p>
<p>
For the radar missions in 2003 and beyond, the technology program should
include continuing improvements in the above areas and the following major
enabling technology items:<p>
<p>
(1)	<b>Antenna:</b>  technology development for an inflatable antenna 
system
that can support electronic beam-steering and multi-frequency, polarimetric 
SAR
observations;<p>
<p>
(2)	<b>RF electronics: </b> technology demonstration of microwave power 
modules
for X-band transmitters and advanced solid-state transmitters for L- and C-
band
SAR systems and development of direct RF synthesis scheme to further reduce 
the
size, weight and power consumption of the RF subsystem;<p>
<p>
(3)	<b>Digital electronics:</b>  technology demonstration for onboard SAR
processor to convert the raw SAR data into SAR imagery and development of
direct data digitization at RF with high speed ADCs<p>
<p>
(4)	<b>Data processing system:</b>  development of a high-throughput 
processing
system for higher-level data product generation.<p>
<p>
All these developments should be an integral part of the core radar technology
program.  The development schedule should ensure that they are ready to 
support
the missions in the first decade of the 2000s.  Again, these technology items
should be integrated into the radar test-bed to provide full functional
demonstration in an end-to-end fashion.  With these advances, radar missions
should be sufficiently light and small to be launched in Pegasus or other
launch vehicles of similar capabilities.  These technology advances will
fundamentally revolutionize the approach to SAR missions, leading to
higher-performance systems at significantly reduced mission costs.<p>

<h1>Standard Data Products - Processed List</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>As of Feb 23, 1995</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This list of processed standard data products are sorted by datatake id.  The
following abbreviations are used :  DT is DataTake, GMT is Greenwich Mean
Time, Lat is  the center Latitude in decimal degrees, Lon is the center Longitude in decimal
degrees, L PR# is the L-band Processing Run Number, C PR# is the C-band
Processing Run Number, and PDT is the Product Data Type (eg. SLC, MLC,
MLD, GEOC)</p>
<p>This list includes both SRL-1 and SRL-2;  you can tell by the GMT, if
it is in the 100's then it is SRL-1, if it is in the 200's then it is
SRL-2</p>
<p>For some datatakes, we do not list the center lat/lon.We will try to
update this list every couple of months.</p>
<p>This list does not include survey processed data which may be found
at the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html">EROS Data Center</a></p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A joint calibration experiment between the synthetic aperture radars (SAR)
onboard NASA/JPL's AIRSAR and Japan's NASDA J-ERS-1 satellite was performed by
co-temporally imaging Manu National Park in Peru on June 7, 1993.  (Manu
National Park is the largest tropical rain forest biosphere reserve on Earth.)
The data from both instruments were subsequently processed and calibrated at
their respective institutions. <i> In situ </i>data at the site in Peru
consisting of ground and aerial photographs, GPS coordinates, dielectric
measurements, ecological characterization, rain forest structural parameters,
and vegetation species identification were collected in early September 1993.
<p>
<p>
Some of the objectives of this experiment were to quantify the relative
calibration of AIRSAR and J-ERS-1 data,  identify ecological habitats from
radar backscatter,  and to classify backscatter response due to structural
characteristics of the rain forest.   Since temporal,  global coverage of the
J-ERS-1 L-band HH polarization SAR exists,  data from this instrument may
provide a means for both remote ecological habitat identification and the
ability to monitor the extent and conversion of rain forests as man encroaches
on ever more remote regions of the world.<p>
<p>
This paper will include a discussion of the calibration of the SAR instruments.
For a description of the structural characteristics of the rain forest in the
region that was imaged, and the ability of the L-band HH channel to
discriminate different forest structural types,  refer to [4].<p>
<p>
<b>THE JOINT AIRSAR/J-ERS-1 CALIBRATION EXPERIMENT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The primary objective of this experiment was to examine the relative
calibration of the J-ERS-1 and AIRSAR data, acquired at the same track angle on
the same day.  This is possible because the tropical rain forest in this area
is homogeneous and of wide extent.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal1.gif"><p>
Manu National Park  is a relatively pristine tropical rain forest biosphere
reserve located around the Rio Manu, a tributary of the Amazon River.     A
biological research station at Cocha Cashu has been used for many years as a
base from which to study the wildlife and forests of the park.  Many endangered
species such as the Giant River Otter and the Jaguar are protected and studied
by scientists interested in the preservation of these species and their
habitats.  Identification of their habitats is of crucial importance.  One
additional objective of this experiment, therefore, was to determine the
capability of identifying different ecological habitats with J-ERS-1 data.   A
small team was sent to Manu National Park for ground classification of forest
species identification and forest structural characteristics, and
identification of distinct signatures in the SAR data.<p>
<p>
The incidence angle of the J-ERS-1 data is approximately 35 degrees, while the
incidence angle of the AIRSAR data varies between 15 degrees and 65 degrees.
The scattering behavior changes with incidence angle, so the comparison between
AIRSAR and J-ERS-1 data will be restricted to those portions of the AIRSAR
scene that occur at the incidence angle of J-ERS-1.  See table 1 for a
comparison of the AIRSAR and J-ERS-1 instruments.<p>
<p>
The data collected at this site include a high resolution J-ERS-1 SAR image
processed by NASDA;  16 AIRSAR "compressed Stokes Matrix" scenes;   8 "synoptic
single channel " scenes;  ground and aerial photographs;  GPS coordinates of
distinctive features such as river bends, unusual radar signatures, and human
habitats;  dielectric measurements of trees;   ecological characterization of
regions with distinct radar signatures;  rain forest structural parameters;
and vegetation species identification along the Rio Manu.<p>
<p>
<b>CALIBRATION OF J-ERS-1 DATA - RAIN FOREST ANALYSIS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The J-ERS-1 data was processed and calibrated by the NASDA processing facility.
The data has been resampled to the ground range projection, and has had a
radiometric correction applied, consisting of the effect of the antenna
pattern, the effect of changing surface area with changing incidence angle, the
gains of the system, and the calibration from RCS (radar cross section) to
normalized RCS (s<sup>o</sup>).  The data was calibrated in an absolute sense
by the NASDA processing facility (a calibration constant is supplied).  The
antenna pattern correction was verified by analysis of tropical rain forest
data. [1]<p>
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal2.gif"><p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b>  Noise Estimate<p>
<p>
Analysis of the J-ERS-1 and AIRSAR rain forest data revealed the following
calibration results:<p>
<p>
Noise level estimates for NASDA products were calculated as a function of slant
range by selecting the darkest regions (rivers, lakes) present in two full
resolution images of the Manaus region obtained in July and October of 1993
(image ID c0171a14 and c0230b19).  Figure 1 shows the noise following a
parabolic pattern which is expected due to radiometric correction.  The noise
level at its lowest peak is not far from the nominal -20.5 dBm^2, and averages
over the entire range at roughly -17.5 dBm^2.<p>
<p>
As a function of range,  the Sensitivity Time Control (STC) function sometimes
results in calibration errors with an order of magnitude of 0.3 dB [2].  The
STC is used to increase the dynamic range of the received signal before it is
quantized by the SAR's 3-bit ADC.  A quick examination of J-ERS-1 images of
Delta Junction, Alaska processed and calibrated at the Alaska SAR Facility
(ASF) did not show any sign of this error.  This error may therefore be
correctable during processing.  This error manifests itself as slight light and
dark bands in the range direction.  The locations of these bands are somewhat
predictable, and in some cases an empirical approximate correction may reduce
the magnitude of the error.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal3.gif"><p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.  </b>Range calibration analysis<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal4.gif"><b></b><p>
<b>Table 2.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
If we average several columns of data (corresponding to the range direction)
for all azimuth samples for an entire image, and then plot the result, we
observe,  in addition to the above mentioned STC errors, random slopes to the
data.  This is probably due to inaccurate knowledge of the roll angle of the
SAR sensor, resulting in a slightly shifted in range antenna pattern
correction.  For example, figure 2 is a plot of the average backscatter as a
function of range for three scenes acquired of Manu National Park.  For the
datatake from June 1993, the plot is fairly flat, but for the two scenes from
August of 1992, we see a gradual decrease in backscatter with range.  In
addition, we see that there is an offset of at least 1 db between the two
dates, which could be either seasonal change in the backscatter, or a
calibration offset.  We caution that the three scenes are not of the same area,
and so limited conclusions about this offset can be made.  However, the change
in slope is probably due to a different amount of error in the roll angle
estimate for the two dates.  Other rain forest data sets that we have examined
have shown the backscatter slope with range varying between positive and
negative values, corroborating this conclusion.  We observe no trend in the
along track (azimuth) direction.<p>
<p>
Table 2 indicates the scene from which the curves of figure 2 were obtained.<p>
<p>
The short term stability of the instrument was examined by comparing rain
forest measurements made within seconds of each other, and several months
apart.  Adjacent images along the same track, and from parallel nearby tracks
were characterized by the average over the whole image and compared.  Since
these scenes are not identical to each other, this analysis is not definitive;
there may be features in the image which result in some inherent difference
between the scenes.  However, the scenes were chosen to be dominated by rain
forest, with a minimum of river, urban, and mountainous areas.  The result is
shown in figure 3.  This plot shows that within a given short interval of time,
the different scenes are very consistent with each other, and could be due
solely to variations in the actual backscatter for each scene.  However, over
many months, there can be significant differences which may be due to time
dependent calibration offsets which have not been accounted for during
processing.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal5.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.</b>  Stability analysis.<p>
<p>
Finally, a comparison was made between AIRSAR L-band HH  and J-ERS-1 rain
forest images obtained over Manu National Park, Peru (both obtained on June 7,
1993).  AIRSAR measurements of the backscatter were made at an incidence angle
of 35 degrees, to agree with the incidence angle of J-ERS-1.  Then, the same
area was measured in the J-ERS-1 image.  Several hundred backscatter
measurements from each instrument were averaged for each of three forest types.
The results are shown in table 3.  This table shows that for the time of the
June 7, 1993 data takes, the AIRSAR and J-ERS-1 instruments were about 1 db
different in terms of calibration.<p>
<p>

<p>
<b>CALIBRATION OF J-ERS-1 DATA -  CORNER REFLECTOR MEASUREMENTS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The AIRSAR compressed Stokes matrix data was calibrated by the AIRSAR processor
as described in [3].  Prior to and immediately after the deployment to South
America, AIRSAR several times imaged the Rosamond Dry Lake calibration array.
This calibration array consists of trihedral corner reflectors oriented towards
the airborne radar.  In September 1993, AIRSAR imaged an array of corner
reflectors at Kerang, Australia.  There are four to five trihedral corner
reflectors in each calibration array.  The results after calibration of the
gain of the corner reflectors are tabulated in table 4.  Using the calibration
coefficients required for this calibration, the AIRSAR data collected during
the South American deployment were calibrated as described in [3].  This
calibration includes absolute calibration, HH - VV Channel imbalance
calibration, HH-VV phase calibration, cross-talk removal,  and radiometric
calibrations such as antenna pattern removal, system gains, and the effect of
changing surface area as a function of incidence angle.  The analysis of the
AIRSAR data is difficult, as a wide range of incidence angles are imaged within
one scene, due to the low altitude of the aircraft.  For this analysis, only
data near the incidence angle of J-ERS-1 were used.  Table 3 indicates that the
L-band radar is calibrated to within about half a dB at the time of the
overflight of the Rio Manu watershed.<p>

<b>Table 4.</b>  AIRSAR absolute calibration residuals (L-band)<p>
<p>
J-ERS-1 data was also acquired over the Rosamond Dry Lake calibration array in
Southern California, (the same array that is used by AIRSAR to determine
absolute calibration offsets), and at a calibration array deployed near Manaus,
Brazil.  The area was imaged on April 30, 1993 at the Rosamond array, and on
July 6, 1993 at the Manaus array.  The J-ERS-1 pass over the Rosamond Dry Lake
is an ascending pass, while all other passes are descending.<p>
<p>
Analysis of the return from 8 foot trihedral corner reflectors present in full
resolution images of the Edwards Air Force Base and Manaus, Brazil calibration
sites generated the results of Table 5.  In this table, Km represents the
measured calibration offset for each corner reflector for NASDA format data
while Kp represents the projected calibration offset provided by NASDA.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal7.gif"><tt>Km-Kp
average   = -0.41 dB</tt><p>
<tt>Km-Kp std. dev. =  0.55 dB</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<b>Table 5.   </b>J-ERS-1 corner reflector measurements<p>
<p>
To obtain Km, a 21 by 21 pixel box centered around the peak of the point
target's return is selected.  The noise and background level estimated from the
non shaded area in Figure 1 is subtracted from the sum of the shaded portion
which contains the point target's impulse response plus the contribution of
noise and background return.  The resulting impulse response is then used along
with the point target's theoretical radar cross section and the image pixel
spacing to calculate the calibration offset Km.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="cal8.gif"><p>
<p>
<b>Figure 4.  </b>Corner Reflector Analysis<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
This indicates that at the time J-ERS-1 imaged the corner reflectors at the
calibration array in Rosamond, the instrument was very close to being
calibrated.  This is somewhat in disagreement with the rain forest
measurements.  However, as figure 3 showed, there are some long term drifts in
the calibration of the J-ERS-1 instrument that may account for the
differences.<p>
<p>
<b>J-ERS-1 IMPULSE RESPONSE ANALYSIS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The impulse response analysis was also performed to analyze the return from the
corner reflectors present in the Edwards and Manaus images mentioned above.
Table 6 presents the results of this analysis which show the resolutions to be
close to nominal, while the PSLR values suggest that the quality of the images
is better than -10 dB.<p>

<a href="plate1.gif">Plate 1. <em>(374Kbytes)</em></a>
This image of Manu National Park, Peru was acquired on June 7, 1993 by the
J-ERS-1 SAR.  In the center of the image, the Madre de Dios River flows from
the West to the East, eventually joining the Amazon river.<p>
<p>
<a href="plate2.jpg">Plate 2. <em>(1.8Mbytes)</em></a>   This Manu National Park, Peru mosaic of AIRSAR synoptically
processed L-band HH polarization data corresponds to the JERS-1 image acquired
on the same date (see plate 1).The image was made from seven flight lines by
AIRSAR.  Five of the flight lines were ascending paths looking toward the West,
while two were decending passes looking toward the East.    Each swath has
incidence angles varying from 10 degrees to 60 degrees.  The natural falloff in
backscatter values with range was not removed.  The rivers flow downstream from
the West to the East, and eventually meet with the Amazon river.  The largest
river in the image is the Madre de Dios.  At the far left of the image is the
Manu river, which meets the Madre de Dios river near the village of Boca Manu.

<b>SPACEBORNE IMAGING RADAR FOR MONITORING THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT - AN
EDUCATIONAL PACKAGE </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A Freeman and K. Crandall</b><p>
<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b><p>
<b>California Institute of Technology</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced an educational package
entitled 'The SIR-C Education Program' (SIR-CED), designed as a two- to
three-week module for middle school and high school students. The SIR-CED
package has also been used to teach college-level undergraduates, particularly
those taking non-science majors, and by engineers and scientists with an
interest in radar imaging, but who are not necessarily imaging radar
specialists. The package includes two educational CD-ROMs called the SIR-C
Education Pre-launch CD-ROM, Volume ID SIRCED01 and the SIR-C Education
Post-launch CD-ROM, Volume ID SIRCED02. In the SIR-CED program students receive
some training in understanding, displaying and analyzing radar images, then may
choose their own research project to explore further. Students are given access
to the same data and data analysis tools used by scientists who utilize radar
images in their studies. <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../gif/SIR-CED02intro2.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>The SIR-C/X-SAR imaging radar flying over Los Angeles</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	SIR-C stands for Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and is the acronym used  for a
radar instrument built to fly on the Space Shuttle and take radar 'pictures' of
the Earth, like the one shown above. SIR-C flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour
in April and October of 1994. Radar images generated by SIR-C are being used by
scientists to help understand some of the global processes which affect the
Earth's environment, such as deforestation in the Amazon, desertification south
of the Sahara, and soil moisture retention in the mid-West United States.<p>
<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>	Imaging radars provide a unique way of looking at the Earth and other
planetary bodies. An imaging radar works very like a flash camera in that it
provides its own light to illuminate an area of interest and take a snapshot
picture, but at radio wavelengths. The chief advantages of using radar are its
ability to 'see' at night and through thick cloud cover. There are currently
several operational spaceborne and airborne imaging radars being used for
remote sensing of the Earth's environment, with more to come in the near
future.<p>
<p>
	SIR-C/X-SAR's unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its
capability to measure, from space, the radar signature of the surface at three
different wavelengths (24 cm, 6 cm and 3 cm), and to make measurements for
different polarizations at two of those wavelengths. SIR-C image data will help
scientists understand the physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar
images at just one wavelength/polarization, such as those produced by an
earlier NASA imaging radar on board the SEASAT satellite, or those generated by
the European ERS-1 or the Japanese JERS-1. Investigators on the SIR-C/X-SAR
Science team will use the radar image data from SIR-C/X-SAR to make
measurements of the following:<p>
<p>
	*  Vegetation type, extent and deforestation<p>
	*  Soil moisture content<p>
	*  Ocean dynamics, wave and surface wind speeds and directions<p>
	*  Volcanism and tectonic activity<p>
	*  Soil erosion and desertification<p>
<p>
	SIR-C is combined with another imaging radar called the X-band Synthetic
Aperture Radar or X-SAR. SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint project of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA) and
the Italian Space Agency (ASI). You'll find out more about SIR-C, X-SAR and how
scientists use imaging radar on the SIR-CED CD-ROMs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>World Wide Web sites</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	To find out even more about imaging radar activities at JPL, World Wide Web
users can take a look at the NASA/JPL Imaging Radar Home Page. The radar group
at JPL have set up a World Wide Web server site, which can be accessed using a
browse tool such as NCSA's Mosaic. The URL for the site is: <p>
<p>
<b>	<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/</a> </b><p>
<b></b><p>
The site contains up-to-date information on the imaging radar program at JPL,
radar images and results from the two SIR-C missions, sample data and videos,
information on how to get radar images and software for displaying radar
images, plus links to other sites which distribute radar images, including a
World Wide Web site known as AskEric, maintained by Syracuse University, which
has the Teachers' Guide and Lesson Plans from SIR-CED on-line at URL:<p>
<p>
<b><a href="http://ericir.syr.edu/NASA/nasa.html">
http://ericir.syr.edu/NASA/nasa.html</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>How to use the SIR-CED CD-ROMs</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The SIR-CED CD-ROMs can be opened using a CD reader on Macintosh, SUN,
and IBM PC computers. They contain a User's guide, a guide for teachers, lesson
plans, and images from sites all around the world covered by SIR-C. Software
for displaying the images provided on all three supported computer platforms is
included on the CD. The comprehensive data set incorporated into the SIR-CED
CD-ROM may also be useful for some engineers and scientists, who wish to
explore the potential of radar observation. The CDs are designed so that they
can be used separately, so you don't have to have both of them to begin using
the SIR-CED program. You'll find a description below of the contents of each of
the two SIR-CED CD-ROMs, plus some frequently asked questions.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SIRCED01</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The SIRCED01 CD-ROM contains a pre-launch look at the SIR-C/X-SAR mission, the
sites to be covered and the science planned for the mission. To access the
CD-ROM, you'll need a computer with a CD-ROM drive connected to it and properly
installed. The SIR-CED CD-ROMs can be opened on Macintosh, PC, SUN and Indigo
computer systems. Place the CD-ROM in the caddy of your CD drive, then gently
insert the caddy into the drive itself, and off you go. On the Macintosh
computer, when you open up the SIRCED01 CD-ROM, you should see three folders
and six files arranged something like this:<p>
<IMG SRC="../gif/SIR-CED02intro3.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Top level file organization of the SIRCED01 CD-ROM</i><p>

<p>
<b>SIRCED02</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The SIRCED02 CD-ROM contains actual results and data from the two SIR-C/X-SAR
missions. Some new features included on this second SIR-CED CD-ROM are movie
visualizations from the missions and the data produced during them, a 'roadmap'
to the CD-ROM which uses the Mosaic browse tool, a simplified top level
directory structure, plus a sample project. Otherwise, the organization of the
second SIR-CED CD-ROM is very similar to the first. To access the CD-ROM,
you'll need a computer with a CD-ROM drive connected to it and properly
installed. The SIR-CED CD-ROMs can be opened on Macintosh, PC, SUN and Indigo
computer systems. Place the CD-ROM in the caddy of your CD drive, then gently
insert the caddy into the drive itself, and off you go. On the Macintosh
computer, when you open up the SIRCED02 CD-ROM, you should see four folders and
two files arranged something like this:<p>

<p>
 In the summers of '92 and '93, through the combined efforts of the
Johns 
Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth and Earthwatch's Challenge Awards
program, 
eleven students from across the country worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory assembling the crew notebook for shuttle mission STS-59, the
Space 
Radar Laboratory.(SRL)
This April, three of those students followed up on 
that, working at Johnson Space Center in Houston (Mission Control) as
crew 
support during the actual mission.

bgcolor="#ffffff"><b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The <b>CEOS Reader Software Package</b> contains the following software:<p>
<p>
- CEOS_READER which reads SIR-C data from tape, copies data to disk, reads
headers and outputs ASCII header files to disk.<p>
<p>
- DCOMP contains subroutines for decompression and recompression of SIR-C data.
For any format SIR-C data or AIRSAR format data, DCOMP will synthesize any
polarization from quad pol data or a given polarization from dual and single
pol data to a byte image.  DCOMP also multilooks data to the desired amount.<p>
<p>
- CVERT software which converts data between different AIRSAR and SIR-C data
formats.  CVERT also multilooks data to the desired amount.<p>
<p>
- SIRC-REG software displays and co-registers SIR-C, XSAR, AIRSAR, and byte
image data with and IDL graphical interface.<p>
<p>
- RAVEN software runs with an IDL graphical interface and synthesizes any
polarization from quad pol data, and calculates polarization signatures,
performs statistical analysis.  RAVEN works with both SIR-C and AIRSAR format
data.<p>
<p>
<p>
The <b>SIRC Utilities Software</b>, which is part of the CEOS Reader Software
Package, is written in IDL and includes the following programs:<p>
<p>
- SIRC_Synth:  Image synthesis from decompressed SIR-C data.  Allows the user
to synthesize trial byte images using subsampled data.  When the user approves
the look of the trial image, an image is synthesized from the original data.<p>
<p>
- SIRC_GetImgInf:  Prints out the number of samples, number of records, data
format and mode given the SIRC ascii header.<p>
<p>
- SIRC_Extract:  Draw polygons on a SIR-C image.  Compute stats on values
inside the polygons.<p>
<p>
- ViewByte:  Display a byte image.  Scales the image to fit on the screen if
necessary.<p>
<p>
- ViewRGB:  Displays a 3 color overlay given three byte images.  Scales the
image to fit the screen if necessary.<p>

<b>SIR-C Sample Data Set</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>by Bruce Chapman, Anthony Freeman, and Patti Barrett</b><p>
<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Spaceborne Imaging Radar - C (<b>SIR-C</b>) is a unique imaging
system designed to look at the Earth's environment using radars of different
wavelength and polarizations.  <b>SIR-C</b> was flown on the Space Shuttle
Endeavour in April and October, 1994 and collected data over many sites of
scientific interest around the globe.  To find out more about <b>SIR-C</b>,
take a look at the NASA/JPL imaging radar home page on the World Wide Web at
<b>
<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/</a>
</b> .<p>
<p>
<b>SIR-C</b> data is stored in a special format unique to fully polarimetric
(<i>i.e</i>. both horizontal and vertical transmit and receive polarizations)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (<b>SAR)</b> data, and achieves an efficient
compression ratio with little loss in information. In addition,  the Committee
on Earth Observing Systems (<b>CEOS</b>) has defined a structure for <b>SAR</b>
data and the headers that accompany it.  A <b>CEOS</b> data set consists of 3
files : a leader file, an image file, and a trailer file.  In addition, each
tape has a volume descriptor.  This structure, called the <b>CEOS</b> format,
defines the file structure of the <b>SIR-C</b> data as it is found on
<b>CEOS</b> format tapes. <p>
<p>
	This document briefly describes two tapes : a <b>CEOS</b> format tape and a
tar (unix) tape.  The <b>CEOS</b> format tape is similar to data normally
distributed by NASA.  The tar tape contains this document, two other readme
files describing the data format in detail, and 6 directories containing
<b>SIR-C SAR </b>data from the <b>CEOS</b> tape in various formats, after being
decoded by JPL developed <b>CEOS</b> reader software.<p>
<p>
Software has been written to read this data from tape, write it to disk, decode
the <b>CEOS </b>headers, decompress the data, average the data, synthesize byte
images, and convert between various other common formats.  This software may be
obtained from the <b>SIR-C</b> project by contacting Ellen O'Leary at the Radar
Data Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, USA 91109 (fax :
1-818-393-2640).  (Software information may also be found at the World Wide Web
server for NASA/JPL imaging radar data at 
<b>
<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/</a>
</b>)<p>
<p>
This sample data set has been prepared to illustrate the data formats of
<b>SIR-C  </b>data.  Example data from each of the following has been
prepared:<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Single Look Complex </b> (<b>SLC</b>) -  <u>Compressed Scattering Matrix
data. </u> May be single (4 bytes per pixel), dual (6 bytes per pixel), or Quad
(10 bytes per pixel) pol.  (Example data is quad pol, meaning that four
polarizations are included.)<p>
<p>
<b>Multi Look Complex</b> (<b>MLC</b>) -  <u>Compressed cross-products of the
Stokes Matrix data.</u>  May be dual (5 bytes per pixel), or Quad (10 bytes per
pixel).  (Example data is quad pol.)<p>
<p>
<b>Multi Look Detected </b>(<b>MLD</b>) -  <u>Compressed single pol power
values </u>(2 bytes per pixel).<p>
<p>
<p>
A detailed description of these data formats may be found in the <b>SIR-C
</b>data format description file (<b><i>Readme.dataformat</i></b>).<p>
<p>
<b>CEOS</b> data  consists of the <b>CEOS</b> leader file, the <b>CEOS</b>
imagery file, and the <b>CEOS</b> trailer file.  In addition, each <b>CEOS</b>
tape contains a volume descriptor record.  A detailed description of the
<b>CEOS</b> format may be found in the <b>SIR-C CEOS</b> description file
(<b><i>Readme.ceosdesc</i></b>).<p>
<p>
<p>
Two tapes are provided with this document.  One tape is a tar (unix) tape, and
should be tar'd to disk.  Contained within this tape are this readme file; the
above mentioned readme files : (<b><i>Readme.dataformat, Readme.ceosdesc)
</i></b>;<b><i>  </i></b>and 6 directories (one for each wavelength and data
type <b>MLC</b>, <b>MLD</b>, or <b>SLC</b>).  Within each directory are the
decoded <b>CEOS</b> files, and gif images of the data file, along with
miscellaneous output files. The other tape is a <b>CEOS</b> tape, and contains
just the <b>CEOS</b> files described in <b><i>Readme.ceosdesc</i></b>.  <p>
<p>
Two examples of each data format were created, one for each wavelength (L-band
= 24 cm,  and C-band = 6 cm).  The scene for all examples are of Stovepipe
Wells, Death Valley, California. The <b>CEOS</b> tape contains the following:<p>
<p>
Product 1 :	pr10141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>
	pr10141_img_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>image </i>file) <u>L-band <b>SLC</b> data 220
MB</u><p>
 	pr10141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
Product 2 : 	pr10142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>
	pr10142_img_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>image </i>file) <u>C-band <b>SLC</b> data 220
MB</u><p>
 	pr10142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
Product 3 :	pr50141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>
	pr50141_img_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>image </i>file) <u>L-band <b>MLC</b> data 13
MB</u><p>
 	pr50141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
Product 4 :	pr50142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>
	pr50142_img_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>image</i> file) <u>C-band <b>MLC</b> data 13
MB</u><p>
<u></u> 	pr50142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
Product 5 :	pr70141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>
	pr70141_img_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>image</i> file) <u>L-band  <b>MLD</b> data 3
MB</u><p>
<u></u> 	pr70141_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
Product 6 :	pr70142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>leader</i> file) <p>

MB</u><p>
<u></u> 	pr70142_ldr_ceos (<b>CEOS</b> <i>trailer</i> file) <p>
<p>
The<b> MLC</b> and <b>MLD</b> sample data were generated from calibrated
<b>SLC</b> data.  It will differ in minor ways from actual <b>MLC</b> and
<b>MLD</b> <b>CEOS</b> data tapes as distributed by NASA:<p>
<p>
<b>1.  	</b>The data is approximately projected onto a flat Earth surface.  The
pixel spacing (36 meters)  is different from the standard (NASA distributed)
pixel spacing (12.5 meters).  The number of independent samples averaged to
form each pixel (number of looks) is 18, rather than the standard ~5 looks.  <p>
<p>
<b>2. </b>	The file names of the data are simulated processing run numbers.
The <b>CEOS</b> headers assume that the processing run number is 10141 and
10142.  Auxiliary files such as histogram files generated by the ceos_reader
software will therefore be named pr10141_histoplot_*<p>
<p>
<b>3. </b> 	A normal <b>CEOS</b> tape will have only one data type (<b>SLC</b>,
<b>MLC</b>, or <b>MLD</b>) on a tape.<p>
<p>
<b>4. </b> 	The <b>MLD</b> data set is single polarization data (H transmit, H
receive) that was extracted from the fully polarimetric <b>SLC</b> data.<p>
<p>
<b>5. </b> 	The <b>SLC</b> data is the highest resolution data format,
typically with resolution of 8 meters.  For NASA-supplied <b>SIR-C CEOS MLD</b>
or <b>MLC</b> data, the resolution will usually be 18 meters.  For the
<b>MLC</b> and <b>MLD</b> data provided on this sample data set,  the
<b>CEOS</b> header indicates that the resolution is 0.0 meters, rather than the
actual 60 meters.<p>

description</title></head><body><b>SIR-C Standard Data  Formats</b><p>
<b>by Bruce Chapman and Anthony Freeman, Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	For each pixel in a SIR-C image, we obtain a measurement of the "single-look"
(not averaged) "scattering matrix" <b>S</b>, which represents the reflectivity
of the area being observed at a given radar wavelength.  Each of the four
complex elements of this matrix  is the <b>amplitude</b> and <b>phase</b> of
the backscattered radiation as measured at one of four orthogonal
transmit/receive polarizations : Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive (HH);
Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive (HV); Vertical transmit, Horizontal
receive (VH);  and Vertical transmit, Vertical receive (VV).  These are
denoted:<p>
<p>
	Shh	Svh<p>
	Shv	Svv<p>
<p>
(Sometimes,  only two polarizations are acquired, and this is known as the dual
pol mode.  Occasionally, only one transmit/receive polarization measurement is
made, and this is known as the single pol mode.  When all four transmit/receive
polarizations are acquired, this is known as the quad pol mode.  The particular
mode selected for any given data take is determined by the scientific
requirements at that site. )<p>
<p>
	When we "multilook" (average) the data, we save only the cross-products of
elements of this matrix (e.g. ShhShh* where * means complex conjugate).  These
complex cross-products preserve most of the important amplitude and phase
information that is needed to analyze the data.<p>
	For SIR-C  there are three possible data formats:<p>
<p>
		1) compressed cross-products data (MLC)  (Multilook data)<p>
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel; or dual-pol, 5 bytes per pixel <p>
<p>
		2) compressed detected data (MLD)  (Multilook data)<p>
			 single-pol, 2 bytes per pixel<p>
<p>
		3) compressed scattering matrix data (SLC)  (Singlelook data)<p>
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel; or dual-pol, 6 bytes per pixel;  or
single-pol, 4 bytes per pixel <p>
<p>
	In the following descriptions:<p>
	<p>
		<b>sign( ) </b>will return the sign of the argument ( +/- 1) <p>
<p>
		<b>nint( ) </b>will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of
its argument.  <p>
<p>
		<b>int( ) </b>will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value
to integer is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value
is less than zero, subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this
is <u>not </u>the same as FORTRAN int( ).<p>
<p>
	To indicate the real part of a complex number, <b>Re</b> is used.  To indicate
the imaginary part of a complex  number, <b>Im</b> is used.  sqrt indicates
taking the square root.<p>
<p>
	The image data has a variable number of lines and pixels (range samples).
Each pixel of data will be between 2 and 10 bytes long.  The bytes of each
pixel are numbered such that byte(1) is the first byte, byte(2) is the second
byte, etc.  <p>
<p>
	For analysis of radar backscatter signatures, most users will be able to use
the MLC or MLD data.  In studying imaging radar interferometry, the SLC data
<b>MUST</b> be used.<b>Single Look Complex data</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	There are three<b> </b>data products for complex scattering matrix data,
depending on polarization mode.<p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "SLC" quad-pol data </b>- 10 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (pixels) (found in CEOS header), in which range
increases with sample (pixel) number.  There are a variable number of lines per
file (found in CEOS header), in which each line corresponds to different
azimuth or along track locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes
of data preceding each line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix
bytes after the file has been stripped by the JPL CEOS_READER software).
There are also separate  CEOS leader and trailer (header) files.  This data is
single look complex scattering matrix data.  <p>
<p>
	 Each pixel of data will be 10 bytes long.  The following description of
decoding the scattering matrix for each pixel assumes that byte(1) of a pixel
is the first byte, byte(2) is the second byte, etc.  The total power (when
decompressing) is :<p>
<p>
		TP =  <b>0.25</b> ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup>) <p>
<p>
	(This number is meaningful only for Quad-pol data, and is the sum of the
<b>power</b> of the elements of the scattering matrix divided by 4.)  The real
and imaginary parts of each of the elements of the scattering matrix are given
as shown below  (using the following scale factor):<p>
<p>
		ysca =  sqrt{ [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup> }<p>
<p>
		<b>Re</b>(SHH) = byte(3) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Im</b>(SHH) = byte(4) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Re</b>(SHV) = byte(5) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Im</b>(SHV) = byte(6) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Re</b>(SVH) = byte(7) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Im</b>(SVH) = byte(8) ysca/127<p>
		<b>Re</b>(SVV) = byte(9) ysca/127<p>
			<b>Im</b>(SVV) = byte(10) ysca/127<p>
<p>
	The  above quantities are dimensionless, but they are the square root of power
ratios.   If it is desired to compress the scattering matrix to this 10 byte
format, the following operations should be performed:<p>
<p>
	Byte(1) :  int{log2 (SHHSHH<sup>*</sup> + SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> +
SVHSVH<sup>*</sup>+ SVVSVV<sup>*</sup>)}<p>
	Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}<p>
<p>
	where<p>
		Mantissa =  (SHHSHH<sup>*</sup> + SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> + SVHSVH<sup>*</sup>+
SVVSVV<sup>*</sup>) / 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup><p>
<sup></sup><p>
	Then, using the following scale factor, we compress the real and imaginary
parts of the scattering matrix:	<p>
	qsca =  sqrt{ [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup> }<p>
<p>
	Byte(3) : nint{127 <b>Re</b>(SHH)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(4) : nint{127<b> Im</b>(SHH)/qsca}<p>
 	Byte(5) : nint{127 <b>Re</b>(SHV)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(6) : nint{127 <b>Im</b>(SHV)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(7) : nint{127 <b>Re</b>(SVH)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(8) : nint{127<b> Im</b>(SVH)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(9) : nint{127 <b>Re</b>(SVV)/qsca}<p>
	Byte(10) : nint{127 <b>Im</b>(SVV)/qsca}<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "SLC" dual-pol data</b> - 6 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (found in CEOS header), in which range increases with
sample number.  There are a variable number of lines per file (found in CEOS
header), in which each line corresponds to different azimuth or along track
locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes of data preceding each
line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix bytes after the file has
been stripped by the JPL CEOS_READER software).    There are also separate
CEOS leader and trailer (header) files.  This data is single look complex
scattering matrix data.    The compression format is the same as for the
quad-pol data format above, except that only 6 of the 10 bytes are present.
The bytes present depend on the polarization mode :<p>
<p>
	HH and VV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,3,4,9,10<p>
	HH and HV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,3,4,5,6<p>
	VH and VV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,7,8,9,10<p>
<p>
Where the numbers refer to the byte numbering used for quad pol data above.<p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "SLC" single-pol data</b> - 4 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (pixels) (found in CEOS header), in which range
increases with sample (pixel) number.  There are a variable number of lines per
file (found in CEOS header), in which each line corresponds to different
azimuth or along track locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes
of data preceding each line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix
bytes after the file has been stripped by the JPL CEOS_READER software).
There are also separate  CEOS leader and trailer (header) files.  This data is
single look complex scattering matrix data.   The compression format is the
same as for the quad-pol data format, except that only 4 of the10 bytes are
present.  The bytes present depend on the polarization mode:<p>
<p>
	HH polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,3,4<p>
	VV polarization mode : bytes 1,2,9,10<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>Where the numbers refer to the byte numbering used for quad pol
data above.<p>
<b>Multi Look Complex data</b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>	There are <b>two</b> possible data formats for cross-products
data, depending on polarization mode.<p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "MLC" quad-pol data</b> - 10 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (found in CEOS header), in which range increases with
sample number.  There are a variable number of lines per file (found in CEOS
header), in which each line corresponds to different azimuth or along track
locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes of data preceding each
line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix bytes after the file has
been stripped by the JPL CEOS_READER software).    There are also separate
CEOS leader and trailer (header) files.   This data is multi look complex
cross-product data.   The data has been symmetrized such that SHV = 0.5 (SHV
+SVH).  <p>
<p>
 Each pixel of data will be 10 bytes long.  The following description of
decoding the cross-products of the scattering matrix for each pixel assumes
that byte(1) of a pixel is the first byte, byte(2) is the second byte, etc.
The total power (when  decompressing) is :<p>
<p>
		TP =  <b>0.25</b> ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup>)<p>
<p>
	(This number is meaningful only for Quad-pol data, and is the sum of the power
of the elements of the scattering matrix divided by 4.)  The crossproducts of
the scattering matrix are given as shown below  (using the following scale
factor):<p>
<p>
		qsca = [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup><p>
<p>
		SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> = qsca[ (byte(3) + 127)/255]^<sup>2</sup><p>
<sup></sup>		SVVSVV<sup>*</sup> = qsca[ (byte(4) + 127)/255]<sup></sup><p>
<sup>		</sup>SHHSHH<sup>*</sup> =<sup> </sup>qsca -<sup> </sup>SVVSVV<sup>*
</sup>- 2 SHVSHV<sup>*</sup><p>
<sup></sup>			Re(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(5))
[byte(5)/127]^<sup>2</sup>}<p>
			Im(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(6))
[byte(6)/127]^<sup>2</sup>}<p>
			Re(SHHSVV<sup>*</sup>) =   qsca  [byte(7)/254]<p>
			Im(SHHSVV<sup>*</sup>) =   qsca  [byte(8)/254]<p>
			Re(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(9))
[byte(9)/127]^<sup>2</sup>}<p>
		Im(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(10))
[byte(10)/127]^<sup>2</sup>}<p>
<p>
	The  above quantities are dimensionless, but they are power ratios.  If it is
desired to compress the cross-products to this 10 byte format, the following
operations should be performed:<p>
<p>
	Byte(1) :  int{log2(SHHSHH<sup>*</sup> + 2SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> +
SVVSVV<sup>*</sup>)}<p>
	Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}<p>
	Mantissa = (SHHSHH<sup>*</sup> + 2SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> + SVVSVV<sup>*</sup>) /
2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup>)<p>
<p>
Then we compress the real and imaginary parts of the scattering matrix:	<p>
<p>
	Byte(3) : nint{255 sqrt(SHVSHV<sup>*</sup> / qsca)} - 127<p>
	Byte(4) : nint{255 (SVVSVV<sup>*</sup> / qsca)} - 127<p>
	Byte(5) : 127 nint{sign[<b>Re</b>(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>)]
sqrt(2|<b>Re</b>(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>) | / qsca)}	<p>
	Byte(6) : 127
nint{sign[<b>Im</b>(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>)]sqrt(2|Im(SHHSHV<sup>*</sup>) | /
qsca)}<p>
	Byte(7) : nint{127 (2<b>Re</b>(SHHSVV<sup>*</sup> )  / qsca)}<p>
	Byte(8) : nint{127 (2<b>Im</b>(SHHSVV<sup>*</sup> )  / qsca)}<p>
	Byte(9) :
127nint{sign[<b>Re</b>(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>)]sqrt(2|<b>Re</b>(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>)
| / qsca)}<p>
	Byte(10) :
127nint{sign[<b>Im</b>(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>)]sqrt(2|<b>Im</b>(SHVSVV<sup>*</sup>)
| / qsca)}<p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "MLC" dual-pol data</b> - 5 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (found in CEOS header), in which range increases with
sample number.  There are a variable number of lines per file (found in CEOS
header), in which each line corresponds to different azimuth or along track
locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes of data preceding each
line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix bytes after the file has

CEOS leader and trailer (header )files.   This data is multi look complex
cross-product data.   The data has been symmetrized such that SHV = 0.5 (SHV

except that only 5 of the 10 bytes are present.  The bytes present depend on
the polarization mode :<p>
<p>
	HH and VV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,4,7,8<p>
	HH and HV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,3,5,6<p>
	VH and VV polarization mode  : bytes 1,2,3,9,10<p>
<p>
Where the numbers refer to the byte numbering used for quad pol data above.<p>
<p>
<b>Multi Look Detected data</b><p>
<b></b>	<p>
	There is  one Multilook detected data product : <p>
<p>
	<b>SIR-C "MLD" single pol data</b> - 2 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file
for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of a variable
number of  range samples (found in CEOS header), in which range increases with
sample number.  There are a variable number of lines per file (found in CEOS
header), in which each line corresponds to different azimuth or along track
locations.  The CEOS format data has the 12 prefix bytes of data preceding each
line of data.  (There are no header lines or prefix bytes after the file has
been stripped by the JPL CEOS_READER software).    There are also separate
CEOS leader and trailer (header) files.    This data is multi look detected
power values.  The polarization will be either HH , HV, VH, or VV, depending on
mode.<p>
<p>
 	Each pixel of data will be 2 bytes long.  The following description of
decoding the cross-products of the scattering matrix for each pixel assumes
that byte(1) of a pixel is the first byte, byte(2) is the second byte.  The
total power (when  decompressing) is :<p>
<p>
		pow  =   ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup>)<p>
<p>
	The  above quantity is dimensionless, but it is a  power ratio.  If it is
desired to compress the cross-products to this 2 byte format, the following
operations should be performed:<p>
<p>
	Byte(1) :  int{log2(SXYSXY<sup>*</sup>)}<p>
	Byte(2) : nint{254[SXYSXY<sup>*</sup>/2^<sup>Byte(1)</sup>  - 1.5]}<p>

Title: The NASA/JPL Aircraft Topographic Synthetic Aperture
         Radar (TOPSAR) System for Rapid Production of Digital
         Terrain Models

We have developed an aircraft radar interferometer, TOPSAR, that
uses a synthetic aperture radar and interferometry to rapidly
produce topographic maps of the earth. In some applications, this
radar technique has the potential of replacing traditional
photogrammetry which uses aerial photography. In other
applications, this aircraft radar interferometer system can map areas
inaccessible to aerial photography because of darkness or weather.
Our aircraft radar is a processor to a possible satellite system, which
can produce a global digital topographic map of the earth.

We operate a C-band (6 cm wavelength) radar interferometer as an
adjunct to the JPL Aircraft Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR)
system that routinely acquires multi-polarization SAR images at P-
band (70 cm wavelength), at L-band (25 cm wavelength) and at C-
band. The TOPSAR/AIRSAR system flies on the DC-8 Airborne
Laboratory operated by the NASA Ames Research Center. The
TOPSAR system is implemented via two antennas mounted nearly
vertically on the left side of the DC-8 aircraft with a 2.6 meter
baseline spacing. Interferometric maps of the surface are constructed
by comparing the phase differences between SAR images from the
two antennas.  Statistical elevation errors for the TOPSAR system
range from 1.0 meters for flat land to 3.0 meters for mountainous
areas. Horizontal resolutions are 5 to 10 meters.

(NOTE-Jan Martin and/or Jakob van Zyl can provide you with details
of the output  Format, ordering products, etc.)

Typical data acquisitions are for areas of 10 km across-track (i.e. in
range) and up to 50 km along track (i.e. in azimuth). Analysis of
radar data obtained in the Galapagos Islands (Islas Fernandina and
Isabella) demonstrated that these 10 km-by-50 km topographic
maps could be mosaicked together for an area of about 50 km-by-
50 km. We improved the TOPSAR aircraft radar system in 1994 by
installing a new tightly-coupled Global Positioning/Inertia Navigation
System (GPS/INS) unit. This improved our topographic data and
enabled mosaicking via dead reckoning.

These aircraft observations are a precursor for a possible earth-
orbiting TOPographic SATellite (TOPSAT), which is currently in
premission studies at JPL. Current TOPSAT plans call for two nearly
identical spacecraft that will be launched and operated in tandem.
The L-band (25 cm wavelength) radar system on the TOPSAT two
satellites will be able to acquire a global topographic map of the
earth with height resolution of 2 to 5 meters for ground resolution
pixels with sizes of 30 meters.

<h1>NASA/JPL AIRSAR</h1>
<p>
The NASA/JPL AIRSAR is a side-looking imaging radar system which
utilizes the Synthetic Aperture principle to obtain high resolution images which
represent the
radar backscatter of the imaged surface at different frequencies and
polarizations.  The image coordinates are usually slant or ground range and
azimuth.  Slant
 range is a measure of the radial distance of the image object from the
radar.
Ground range is a measure of the distance of the object from a point
directly below the aircraft.  Near range in the images is closest to the aircraft
and far range is furthest away.  The azimuth dimension in the images is parallel
to the line described by the track of the aircraft (see figure).  The spatial
resolution
 of the AIRSAR images, which determines how far apart two objects have
to be in
order to separate them in the image, is on the order of 12 x 12 meters.
Note that this is not the same as the range or azimuth pixel spacing which is
contained
 in the variable format header of the AIRSAR data.
</p><p>
The information contained in each pixel of the AIRSAR data represents
the radar
backscatter for all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical
transmit and receive polarizations (i.e. HH, HV, VH, and VV).  The data is in
compressed Stokes matrix format, which has 10 bytes per pixel. From this data format
it is possible to synthesize a number of different radar backscatter
measurements. The MacSigma0 and MacMultiView software packages allow the synthesis of
images and analysis of data for some of the more important radar backscatter
measurements for
 AIRSAR data. Each pixel contains information about the radar
backscatter for a
single frequency only.  Other image files may be available which contain
informa
tion about the radar backscatter at different frequencies.  The radar
backscatter measurement is a strong function of incidence angle, which is defined
as:
</p><p>
        qi = cos-1(h/(R0+iDR))

</p><p>
where h is the altitude of the aircraft (typically about 8 km), R0 is
near range
 in the image (typically 8-10 km), DR is the size of the (slant) range
pixels in
 meters and i is the line number of the object in the image.  The
incidence angle is defined with respect to the normal to the EarthM-Us surface.  The
above expression is strictly valid for a flat Earth only.  Radar backscatter
usually has
a tendency to decrease as the incidence angle increases.  This effect
can often
be seen in AIRSAR images, where the incidence angle is typically in the
range of
 0 to 70 degrees.  The smaller incidence angles correspond to near range
in the
AIRSAR data, while the larger incidence angles correspond to far range.

Much of the data produced by the AIRSAR is now calibrated, so that the
radar backscatter measurements are in normalized radar cross section format
(m2/m2) or s0
. s0 is the radar cross section (measured in m2) normalized by the area
of the measurement, which in this case is the pixel area in square meters.
Results obtained using uncalibrated AIRSAR data should be treated with caution.  If a
trihedral corner reflector is deployed within the imaged scene and a few simple
measurements about that reflector are known, then there are facilities in the
MacSigma0
 and POLCAL software to lend assistance.
</p><p>
The direct measurements of radar backscatter which are made by the
AIRSAR systems are the elements of the scattering matrix: Shh, Shv, Svh and Svv,
which represent the backscatter for each pixel in response to the 4 different
combinations of H and V transmit and receive polarizations.  Shv is the scattering
matrix term
 for H transmit, V receive, for example.  The scattering matrix
measurements are
 complex numbers, with amplitude and phase.
</p><p>
The Shv and Svh measurements are equal by the principle of backscatter
reciprocity.  In AIRSAR data, only the Shv term is retained.  The AIRSAR data is
issued in compressed Stokes matrix format.  An intermediate step in forming the
Stokes matrix for each pixel is to form the cross-products:

        (1) Shh Shh* ( shh0)
</p><p>
        (2) Shv Shv*  (shv0)
</p><p>
        (3) Svv Svv*  (svv0)
</p><p>
        (4) Shh Svv*
</p><p>
        (5) Shh Shv*
</p><p>
        (6) Shv Svv*
</p><p>

These cross-products can be recovered from the Stokes matrix data
format, which
can be considered as a type of coding.  The first three are s0
measurements.  The last three are complex numbers, with amplitude expressed in s0 and a
phase term which can be expressed in degrees.  The phase is between -180 and 180
degrees.
</p><p>
  In displaying the ShhSvv* term using MacSigma0, for example, the
amplitude is
displayed as a grey scale, the phase as a color representation.
</p><p>
Experience with AIRSAR data has shown that the first four of the above
cross-products contain the most information about the imaged surface.
</p><P>
The reader interested in more background information on radar
polarimetry is referred to the papers listed.

The following diagram may clarify some of the geometric terms mentioned

<h2>Compressed Stokes Matrix Data Format</h2>

</p><P>
The compressed Stokes matrix data format is composed of 10 bytes per
pixel preceded by two ASCII headers, the .i.variable format header;.i.compressed
Stokes matrix format: variable format header; and the .i.M-RoldM-S
header;.i.compressed Stokes matrix format:"old" header;.  Both the variable format header and
the M-RoldM-S header are composed of 50-character fields where one character is
saved per
 byte. In general, a compressed Stokes matrix data file looks like the
following
:


</P><P>

The following information is contained in the variable format header:

where M-TNNNNNNNNM-U represents a right-justified integer value,
M-TXXXX.XXXXM-U
 represents a right-justified real number, and M-TCCCCCCCCM-U represents
a character string.  The number of bytes per sample (field 5) must be 10 and
fields 11
and 13 must point to the M-RoldM-S header (described below) and the
beginning of
 the data respectively.
</P><P>
The contents of fields 14 through 16 vary depending on which AIRSAR
processor wa
s used and may not exist at all.  It was originally intended that they
would be
used to keep track of the relative location of the data set being
examined with
respect to the M-RoriginalM-S data set.

</P><P>
The M-RoldM-S header is composed of approximately 160 50-character
fields and co
ntains information recorded during the acquisition of the data and
information a
dded during correlation and possibly calibration.  In versions of the
SAR correl
ator prior to 1990,  this is the only header saved with each data set
(it is sav
ed in the 1025th line of the file).  With the addition of the variable
format he
ader, this header became the M-RoldM-S header.

</P><P>
The user header does not usually exist on data obtained direct from JPL.

<b></b><p>
<b>UNIX</b><p>
<b> Bruce Chapman, JPL</b><p>
<b>bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
	(For information about obtaining JPL developed software, please contact
Ellen O'Leary at ellen.oleary@jpl.nasa.gov)<p>
<p>
	The current version of the software is found on tape version 2.0 (March 24,
1995) and contains : CEOS_READER version 2.0, dcomp version 3.0, and cvert
version 2.0).<p>
	This guide will follow a cookbook type approach to loading software to disk,
compiling the code, loading the data to disk, creating the ASCII CEOS header
files, reading the ASCII CEOS header files for the decompression software,
multilooking the data, synthesizing a byte image, and converting between SIR-C
and AIRSAR formats.  The examples given are for a unix system, in particular a
DEC alpha computer running OSF/1, but it should be very similar for any unix
workstation.  On a VAX/VMS system, there are more significant differences, but
they are described in the manuals for the software.<p>
	At the end of the software demonstration description, there is a printout of
all the ASCII files that were created.<p>
	The steps that are taken by each user depend on what they want to do with the
data.  <b>DO NOT BLINDLY DO EVERYTHING IN THIS GUIDE, THINK ABOUT WHAT PRODUCT
YOU WANT AT THE END (A MULTILOOKED IMAGE, A BYTE IMAGE, AN AIRSAR FORMAT IMAGE,
ETC.)</b><p>
<hr size=5>
<b></b>	You need a C  compiler for the CEOS_READER software, and a fortran77
compiler for the dcomp and cvert programs.  You need IDL from RSI, Inc.,  to
run Raven, the SIR-C utility programs, or SIRC-REG.  You will also probably
need an image display program like xv.<p>
<p>
<u>Loading ceos_reader and decompression software, and SIR-C/AIRSAR conversion
software</u><p>
<u></u><p>
1.  make executables<p>
	a.  <b>mkdir</b> a directory for software, <b>cd</b> to directory<p>
	b. <b>tar</b> -xvf /dev/rmt0h  (rmt0h is the tape device name)<p>
	c.  this creates three subdirectories directories :  <b>ceos_reader</b>,
<b>cvert</b>, and <b>dcomp</b><p>
	d.  <b>cd</b> to each directory and make the executables  (C and fortran77).<p>
		1.  in the <b>ceos_reader</b> directory, the command is<p>
		<p>
<i>			&gt;  make -f  ceos_reader.make</i><p>
<i></i><p>
		2.  the user may have to modify this make file if acc (ansi C) is not
defined, or define acc.<p>
<p>
		3.  in the <b>cvert</b> and <b>dcomp</b> directory, the command is<p>
			<p>
<i>			&gt; make</i><p>
<i></i><p>
2.  add directory of software executables to path, or create aliases.<p>
<hr size=5>
<u>What next :</u><p>
<u></u><p>
1.  If you have the program Macsigma0 (which currently is only available on a
Macintosh computer) , then you may want to convert the SIR-C format data to
AIRSAR format.<p>
<p>
	a.   run the CEOS_READER program to copy the data from tape to disk, and
create ASCII CEOS headers.<p>
<p>
	b.  read the ASC II header files with dcomp or cvert.<p>
<p>
	c.  if you have SLC data, then first multilook the data ( I recommend
multilooking the data so that it is approximately in the ground range
projection).  Then, convert it to AIRSAR CM format.  If you have MLC data, you
may still want to multilook the data as the AIRSAR format is limited to 1024
samples.  Then, convert it to the AIRSAR CM format.<p>
<p>
	d.  copy the data to your macintosh computer<p>
<p>
	e.  Macsigma0 displays and performs simple analysis of the data with an easy
user interface.  Macsigma0 is on the SIR-C education pre-flight CD-ROM.<p>
<p>
2.  If you have IDL (interactive display language from RSI, Inc.) :<p>
<p>
	a.  run the CEOS_READER program to copy the data from tape to disk, and create
ASCII CEOS headers.<p>
<p>
	b.  run utility programs to read the headers and synthesize byte images (with
image display).<p>
<p>
	c. or run Raven, which displays and performs simple analysis of the data with
an easy user interface.<p>
<p>
	d.   If you have X-SAR data, and want to co-register it to the SIR-C data,
then run SIRC-REG.<p>
<p>
3.  If you have only simple display software<p>
<p>
	a.   run the CEOS_READER program to copy the data from tape to disk, and
create ASCII CEOS headers.<p>
<p>
	b.  read the ASC II header files with dcomp or cvert.<p>
<p>
	c.  run dcomp to multilook the data (if you want to average the data down.<p>
<p>
	d.  run dcomp to synthesize  a "vicar" labeled byte image.  A byte image with
a vicar label may be displayed with the public domain xv software (version
2.x).  Or, some software may input "raw" byte images and display them.<p>
<p>
4.  Some commercial software vendors support or will support the SIR-C CEOS
format, such as PCI software from PCI, Envi from IDL, or ARC/info from ESRI.<p>
<p>
5.  This guide does not provide information about using interferometry data.<p>
<p>
6.  Refer to the software manuals for using IDL programs such as Raven.<p>
<p>
<hr size=5>
<u>read data from tape and create ASCII CEOS header files</u><p>
<u></u><p>
1.   run <b>ceos_reader</b> software to copy a data set to disk<p>

<h1>What is SIR-C/X-SAR?</h1>
<hr>
SIR-C/X-SAR stands for  Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture
Radar. SIR-C/X-SAR is an imaging radar system scheduled for launch aboard the
NASA Space Shuttle in 1994. It consists of a radar antenna structure and
associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the Space
Shuttle's cargo bay. On take-off, the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in the
graphic on the next page. After the Space Shuttle has reached a stable Earth
orbit, the cargo bay doors will be opened , the antenna structure will be
deployed, and SIR-C/X-SAR will be switched on, to begin using its
state-of-the-art radar technology to image the earth's surface. Radar images
generated by SIR-C/X-SAR will be used by scientists to help understand some of
the processes which affect the earth's environment, such as deforestation in
the Amazon, desertification south of the Sahara, and soil moisture retention in
the Mid-West.<p>
<p>

<h2>The SIR-C/X-SAR Project</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space
Agency (ASI). It is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars,
beginning with SEASAT in 1978, continuing with SIR-A (1981), Germany's
Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment (1983), and SIR-B (1984). It is a precursor
to the Earth Observing System (EOS) imaging radar system planned for the end of
the decade. <p>
<b></b><p>
<h2>Science Objectives</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C/X-SAR's unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its
capability to measure, from space, the radar signature of the surface at three
different wavelengths, and to make measurements for different polarizations at
two of those wavelengths. SIR-C image data will help scientists understand the
physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one
wavelength/polarization, such as those produced by SEASAT. Investigators on the
SIR-C/X-SAR Science team will use the radar image data from SIR-C/X-SAR to make
measurements of the following:<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Vegetation type, extent and deforestation<p>
<li>Soil moisture content<p>
<li>Ocean dynamics, wave and surface wind speeds and directions<p>
<li>Volcanism and tectonic activity<p>
<li>Soil erosion and desertification<p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrument Description</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna structure actually consists of three individual
antennas, one operating at L-band (23.5cm wavelength), one at C-band (5.8cm
wavelength) and the third at X-band (3cm wavelength). The L-band and C-band
antennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontal
and vertical polarizations.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/SIRCdesc3.gif"><p>
<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna is the most massive piece of hardware (at a total of
10,500 kilograms) ever assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and measures
12 meters by 4 meters. The SIR-C instrument was built by JPL and the Ball
Communication Systems Division for NASA and provides the L-band and C-band
measurements at different polarizations. The L-band and C-band antennas employ
phased array technology, which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjusted
electronically. The X-SAR  instrument is built by the Dornier and  Alenia
Spazio companies for DARA and ASI and operates at a single frequency, X-band.
The X-SAR antenna is a slotted waveguide type, which uses a mechanical tilt to
change the beam pointing direction. <p>
<p>
<p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Image Data</h2>
<hr>
	During a week-long Shuttle flight, SIR-C/X-SAR will image an area of roughly
50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface. This corresponds to a
total of 50 hours of data. The peak data rate will be 225 megabits (or
225,000,000 bits) per second. The data collected will be processed into images
with resolution selectable from 10 to 200 meters. The width of the area mapped
out by the radar will vary from 15 to 90 kilometers, depending on how the radar
is operated, and the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing. Data
from SIR-C/X-SAR will be used to develop automatic techniques for extracting
information from radar image data, in preparation for the EOS SAR mission later
in the decade.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/SIRCdesc4.gif"><p>
<p>
This schematic diagram shows the SIR-C/X-SAR antennas illuminating an area on
the ground, and mapping out a swath as the Shuttle moves forward. The area
shown is a SEASAT image of Los Angeles, California. North is to the right of
the image shown.<p>
<p>
<h2>More About SIR-C/X-SAR</h2>
<hr>
	The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian
Space Agency (ASI).  The experiment is the next step forward in NASA's
Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) program that began with the Seasat Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) in 1978, and continued with SIR-A in 1981 and SIR-B in
1984. The program will eventually lead to TOPSAT, a mission to measure
topography globally, and the Earth Observing System (EOS) SAR later in this
decade.  The program also benefits from experience gained with the Magellan
Mission to Venus, other international spaceborne radar programs (e.g. ERS-1,
JERS-1), and prototype aircraft sensors such as the JPL Airborne SAR
(AIRSAR).<p>
<p>
	SIR-C will provide increased capability over SEASAT, SIR-A, and SIR-B by
acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths
([[lambda]]): L- band ([[lambda]] = 23.5 cm) and C-band ([[lambda]] = 5.8 cm).
These vertically- and horizontally-polarized transmitted waves will be received
on two separate channels, so that SIR-C will provide images of the magnitude of
radar backscatter for four polarization combinations: HH
(Horizontally-transmitted, Horizontally-received), VV (Vertically-transmitted,
Vertically-received), HV, and VH; and also data on the relative phase
difference between the HH, VV, VH, and HV returns.  This allows derivation of
the complete scattering matrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis.  From this
scattering matrix, every polarization configuration (linear, circular or
elliptical) can be generated during ground processing.  The radar polarimetric
data will yield more detailed information about the surface geometric
structure, vegetation cover, and subsurface discontinuities than image
brightness alone.  <p>
<p>
	Germany's imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote Sensing
Experiment (MRSE) flown aboard the Shuttle.  This X-band radar was flown on the
first SPACELAB mission in 1983.  The program was continued by development of
the X-SAR, for which cooperation with Italy was initiated.  X-SAR, will operate
at X-band ([[lambda]] = 3.1 cm) with VV polarization, resulting in a
three-frequency capability for the total SIR-C/X-SAR system.  Because radar
backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in size to the
radar wavelength, this multi-frequency capability will provide information
about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with
previous single-wavelength experiments.<p>
<b></b><p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrumentation</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C will provide multi-frequency, multi-polarization radar data.  The SIR-C
instrument is composed of several subsystems: the antenna array, the
transmitter, the receivers, the data-handling subsystem, and the ground SAR
processor.  The antenna is composed of two planar arrays, one for L-band and
one for C-band.  Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dual-polarized
microstrip antenna radiators, with each polarization port fed by a separate
corporate feed network.  The overall size of the SIR-C antenna is 12.0 x 3.7
meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels. <p>
<p>
<b>Model of the SIR-C/X-SAR antenna</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/SIRCdesc5.gif"><p>
<p>
	Unlike previous SIR missions, the SIR-C radar beam is formed from hundreds of
small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar
antenna.  By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters, the beam can
be electronically steered in the range direction +/-23deg. from the nominal
40deg. off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna.
This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence
angles.  <p>
<p>
	X-SAR will provide VV polarization images using a passive slotted waveguide
antenna measuring 12.0 x 0.4 meters.  Other X-SAR components include a
traveling wave tube as transmitter, an exciter, receiver, and data handling
subsystem.  A mechanical  tilt mechanism will point the X-SAR antenna to angles
between 15 and 60deg., in the same direction as the L-band and C-band beams.
<p>
<p>
	Both SIR-C and X-SAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or together.
Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on either
side of the shuttle nadir (ground) track.  The width of the imaged swath on the
ground varies from 15 to 90 kilometers (9 to 56 miles) depending on the
orientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode. Table 1 presents a
summary of the SIR-C/X-SAR system characteristics.<p>

<h3>1. 	Who has used the SIR-CED materials?</h3>

We have distributed over 7,000 copies of the first version of this CD-ROM
(SIRCED01) to educators
teaching at middle school, high school and college undergraduate level. We have
received samples of SIR-CED projects done by students in grades as low as 5 to
7 and positive feedback from many other teachers who have used the SIR-CED
materials in the classroom. From phone calls, e-mails, and faxes sent in to us
by people who have used the first disk, we have compiled this list of
frequently asked questions.<p>
<p>
The first SIR-CED CD-ROM has also been used to teach college-level
undergraduates, particularly those taking non-science majors, and by engineers
and scientists with an interest in radar imaging, but who are not necessarily
imaging radar specialists.<p>

A second version of this CD-ROM (SIRCED02) was produced for Macintosh-only 
computers and a similar number was distributed (approximately 7,000 copies).
<p>

There was demand to make this CD available on other platforms.
So another version of the SIRCED02 CD-ROM was created and is called
<b><i>SIRCED03, PC Special Edition</i></b>. This CD was made especially
for PC computers but it is also readable on Macintosh and Unix platforms.

<h3>2. 	How is this CD (SIRCED03) different 
from your earlier CD (SIRCED01)?</h3>

SIRCED03 is a <i>post-launch</i> look at the same areas of the Earth 
covered by our <i>pre-launch</i> CD (SIRCED01), with a lot more new sites 
added. Most of the features from our first CD (SIRCED01) can be 
found on the second CD. For example, you'll find the pre-SIRC 
launch data from the first CD in directories labeled PreSIRC for those 
sites where that data was available.<p> 

There are actually two different versions of the post-launch CD. 
One is a Macintosh-only CD (SIRCED02) and the other is for
PC computers (SIRCED03, <i>PC Special Edition</i>).
The PC version of the CD can also be read by Macintoshes and Unix
machines.
<p>

The <i>PC Special Edition</i> CD has <b>vastly improved HTML pages</b>,
both in content and aesthetically. It is now much easier to move around
and understand the information on the CD. There are new radar pictures
included on this CD which were not available before.
The <i>PC Special Edition</i> CD can also be read by
Macintosh and Unix platforms.<p>

For a more detailed
description of <i>SIRCED03, PC Special Edition</i>, see
<a href="HOWTOUSE.HTM">How Do I Use The CD?</a>

<h3>3. 	How do I use the Lesson Plans?</h3>

Use the Lesson Guide sheets as handouts for your students or use the
overhead slides to prompt classroom discussion. The Lesson Guides work 
best when combined with the overhead slides so that students 
learn a little (from the teacher presenting the 
slides), then think a little (by going over the Lesson Guide materials). 
You can also supplement your classroom presentations with 
materials from the Teacher's Guide.
<p>
Select the materials that you think will work best for your class. This
 will depend on their grade level, ability and what kind of computer 
equipment is available in your classroom. In the one-computer 
classroom, try to do the computer exercises as a joint class effort,
 with students guiding your hand (or mouse). If you have a computer
 lab, have the students copy the data and/or software
 they will use for any one lesson onto their own disk.
This makes finding files a lot easier.
<p>
There's an easy way to use the lessons on SIRCED03. The directory
 /DOCUMENTS/HTML
contains all the HTML files used in the lesson plans, divided up
 into 5 modules. The directory for each module contains the lessons, 
 presentation materials and Teacher's Guide for that module.
You may access these files through 
<a href="../../DOCUMENT/HTML/CONTENTS.HTM">
a top level HTML directory.
</a>
<p>

<h3>4. 	How can I print the Lesson Plans?</h3>

All lesson plans have been converted to HTML format and can be
viewed by any World Wide Web browser like Netscape.
You may print the lesson plans through Netscape. Select the
<b>File | Print...</b> menu commands to print the current document
that is displayed.
<p>

<h3>5. 	How do I find my way around the Teacher's Guide documents on the
disks?</h3>

<a href="../../DOCUMENT/HTML/TEACHERS/CONTENTS.HTM">
A Table of Contents 
</a>
can be found in the file 
/DOCUMENT/HTML/TEACHERS/CONTENTS.HTM. There are similar 
files in the /DOCUMENT/HTML/LESSONS and /DOCUMENT/HTML/SLIDES directories. 
The Teacher's Guide
is divided up into an introduction and five 
modules. Each module is
divided further into sections. 
For example, module 1, section B introduces the
idea of viewing the Earth from space. This material can be found in the file
MOD1SECB.HTM which is contained in the directory
DOCUMENT/HTML/TEACHERS/MODULE01.<p>
<p>

<h3>6. 	There's a lot of stuff on the CD-ROM. 
Am I expected to go through all of it?</h3>

No. Pick and choose the things you want to use and tailor the materials
to the capabilities of your class. The Teacher's Guide is meant as a reference
book, not a text book, and should be used by the teacher to get up to speed on
imaging radar and SIR-C and as a source book to answer student's questions.
Only the images in the directory 
/DATA/MODS1TO5 are meant to be seen by all students.
The images in other directories are provided for the 
independent projects described in module 5.
<p>

<h3>7. 	How do I open files on the SIRCED03 disk?</h3>

There are six types of files on SIRCED03 with the following file extensions: 
.htm, .gif, .stk, .txt, .mov, .pic<p>
<p>
Files ending in .htm or .gif can be opened from Netscape.
<p>
Files ending in .stk can be opened from within the
 application Sigma0 which is included on SIRCED03 in the
/SOFTWARE directory. See
<a href="SOFTWARE/SIGMAUSE.HTM">How Do I Use The Sigma0 Program?</a>
for more information.
<p>
Files ending in .txt are plain ASCII text files and can be
read from Netscape. The files contain just raw text.
<p>
Files ending in .mov can be played by the Quicktime movie player.
<p>
Files ending in .pic can be displayed by the Picture Viewer program
which is part of the Quicktime movie package.
<p>

<h3>8. (Macintosh Only) I get an error message when 
I click on some of the 
aliases on the CD. What's the problem?</h3>
<p>
 On some demo versions of this CD, we could not get all of the 
aliases which help you navigate around the directories 
and files to work. We found that this problem went away on 
machines that had Quicktime 2.0 in their extension 
directories (we don't know why!) If the aliases don't 
work on your machine, try installing Quicktime 2.0, 
which can be obtained from most Mac dealerships.  
Alternatively, use the Get Info option (under the File menu) 
to find out which original file or directory the alias is 
pointing to. Sorry, but we could not provide Quicktime 2.0 
on the CD due to licensing problems. <p>

<h3>9. (Macintosh Only) When I try to run the NIH Image program 
(e.g. by double-clicking on a
.<i>pic</i>  file) I get a message telling me my 
Macintosh does not have a
floating-point unit. What should I do?</h3>

SIRCED03 contains the newer NIH Image version 1.61b7 which should run 
for both the Power PC and for 68k machines. 

<h3>10. (Macintosh Only) How do I learn more about the 
Image Display software?</h3>

User manuals are provided for the software in the 
Software directory. You'll find
them in the same directories as the software itself. These manuals can be
read using Microsoft Word or a similar word processing program.
<p>
The entire 
<a href="../../DOCUMENT/SIGMA0/SIGMA0.HTM">
Sigma0 User's Guide
</a>
for both Mac and PC is available on
this CD. Also, the NIH Image User's Guide and 
<a href="../../DOCUMENT/HTML/TEACHERS/INTRO/NIHTUTOR.HTM">
tutorial
</a>
is available
on this CD too.
<p>

<h3>11. (Macintosh Only) When using the Macintosh display 
programs, I often get messages telling
me I'm out of memory. What should I do?</h3>

Memory management for the Macintosh programs is discussed in the Teachers
Guide. 
<p>

<h3>12. We only have one CD drive at my school. How can I use the SIR-CED
material on the CDs in my classroom?</h3>

The majority of the files on the SIR-CED CD-ROMs are less than 1.4 MBytes
in size. This was deliberately done so that files (text, images, programs)
could be copied onto floppy disks without too much difficulty 
(the exception to this is the movie files).
If you only have one CD-drive,
you have several options:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Use an overhead projector and a Liquid Crystal Display connected to the
computer or a computer hook-up to a large TV screen with the CD drive to 
display the images, etc. in class.<p>

<li>If you have a classroom where several computers are connected by a
local
area network using a server, place the files you want to use in a 
directory on the
server which can be accessed by all the computers on the network.<p>

<li>Copy the files you want to use off the CD onto floppy disks and then copy
those files over to each machine in the classroom.
</ol>

<h3>13. We don't have a CD-ROM drive at all in my school. What should we
do?</h3>

Buy one if you can. Using CD-ROM technology is the best 
way to get hold of large volumes of data (the Internet is still too 
slow for most users and will be for the foreseeable future).
 Most new computers come with CD-ROM drives these days and 
CD-ROM drives have been offered for as little as $100 in computer 
magazines.<p>

If you can't get a CD-ROM drive but you have an Internet connection, you can
access some of our educational materials developed for the SIR-CED program
 through our World Wide Web site, the NASA/JPL Imaging Radar Home Page,
located at URL:
<p>
<ul>
<a href="HTTP://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/companion/">
http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/companion/
</a>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>14.	We use PC's at my school. How do I 
display the images on the SIR-CED
CD-ROM?</h3>

This version of the CD was prepared especially for the IBM-PC and
compatible computers. You should have no problem displaying the
images once the included software is properly installed.
For more information on hardware and software requirements, see
<a href="HOWTOUSE.HTM">How Do I Use The CD?</a>
For information on the software included with the CD, see
<a href="SOFTWARE/SOFTWARE.HTM">Included Software in the
SIR-C CD-ROM 3, PC Special Edition.</a>

<h3>15.	Where can I find out more?</h3>

We have set up a companion World Wide Web server site to this 
CD at:<p>
<ul>
<a href="HTTP://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/companion/">
The NASA/JPL Imaging Radar Home Page<br>
http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/companion/
</a>
</ul>
<p>

which you can access using Netscape or NCSA's Mosaic browse 
program. You will find more information about NASA/JPL's imaging
 radar program there, as well as the latest images, sample data, 
information on software availability and updates on the SIR-CED 
program. 
<p>

NASA has also set up a wonderful World Wide Web site for 
students and educators called Spacelink, which brings together all 
of NASA's educational material at one site. The URL is:<p>

<ul>
<a href="HTTP://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/">
Spacelink Home Page<br>
http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/
</a>
</ul>

<h3>16. Were there any educational activities 
during the SIR-C flights?</h3>

Yes. Some schools took part in ground data collection activities at the
 SIR-C supersites in the USA. Unfortunately, only a very few students 
can benefit from this experience. To reach a wider audience, during 
each SIR-C flight and after, examples of the latest greatest results, 
including images, were posted to the JPL FTP site 
(jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov or 137.78.104.2). NASA Select television
broadcast live coverage of both flights and some of these broadcasts 
are occasionally repeated. For schools that have satellite dishes, 
satellite transmission will be on Spacenet 2, transponder 5, 
located at 69 degrees West with horizontal polarization. 
Broadcast frequency will be 3880.0 Megahertz, audio on 6.8 
Megahertz. Some cable companies also carry NASA Select as part of
their educational programming.
<p>

<h3>17. Do you plan to produce any more CD's?</h3>

Other than this <i>PC Special Edition</i> CD, the answer is no.
SIRCED03 is the last SIR-CED CD-ROM for now, 
although JPL will certainly
produce more educational CDs in the future, 
based around different projects and
subjects.
<p>

<h3>18. Where can I get hold of more copies of the SIR-CED CD's?</h3>

Both of the SIR-CED CD-ROMs are being distributed by the 
EROS Data Center free of charge. Their address is:

<p>
This information sheet explains how NASA photographs, slides, mission
status information, and CD-ROMs produced by the SIR-C/X-SAR Project at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory,  can be obtained by scientists, educators, and the
general public.   SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint US/German/Italian mission which flew
aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April and October, 1994 as part of the
Space Radar Laboratory. <p>
<p>
The Space Radar Laboratory, part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, studied how
our global environment is changing.  From the unique vantage point of space,
SIR-C/X-SAR observed and monitored large-scale environmental processes with a
focus on climate change.  The spaceborne data, complemented by aircraft and
ground studies, give scientists highly detailed information to help them
distinguish natural environmental changes from those that are the result of
human activity.  <p>

<h2>Digital Data</h2>

SIR-C survey image data are available on CD-ROMs from the U.S.
Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC).   The EDC is the Earth Observing
System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Land Processes Distributed Active
Archive Center (Land Processes DAAC).  <p>
<p>
The survey data are also posted on the EDC World Wide Web site listed above.<p>
<p>
Survey data are uncalibrated, low resolution (50 m) images of entire data
takes.  One CD contains up to twelve data takes.  These data are suitable for
determining the extent of area coverage,
interpreting landforms, and for use in requesting high resolution standard
digital frame products.  SIR-C standard digital image data will be available on
8 mm tapes from the EDC in early 1995.  Standard products are data frames (50
or 100 km in length) that are calibrated and that are higher resolution (~10-45
m) than the survey products.   For information, contact: <p>

The data on this CD-ROM is the culmination ofa decade of work by NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the German SpaceAgency (DARA), the Italian Space Agency (ASI), and many privates companies,universities, and government agencies.<p><p>Flown twice on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during 1994, SIR-C is the next stepin NASA's Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) program. This program began in 1978with the Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and continued with SIR-A in 1981and SIR-B in 1984. This program will eventually lead to TOPSAT, a mission tomeasure global topography (the height of the Earth's surface and specificlocations) and the Earth Observing System (EOS) SAR.<p><p>In addition to NASA's missions mentioned above, the SIR-C program also benefitsfrom the Magellan mission to Venus, other international spaceborne SAR programs(e.g. ERS-1 andJERS-1), and airborne SAR sensors such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory<a href="HTTP://www-airsar.jpl.nasa.gov/">Airborne SAR (AIRSAR).</a><p>Building on the results from these missions, scientists are now using this datato enhance their knowledge of how Earth's land, oceans, and climate interactwith each other. These scientists have waited a decade for this data and nowwe are presenting it to you.<p><p>As you have learned in your studies, science is an iterative, or repetitive,process. A scientist poses a question that will be studied. An experiment isconducted where data is collected. The data is then analyzed in an attempt toanswer the question. Whether or not the question was answered, furtherexperiments are conducted. This allows scientists to collect more data insupport of their findings. Eventually, the scientist's findings are presentedto a group of colleagues. This, however, is not the end of the process. Otherscientists will take these findings and explore new scientific questions andapplications.<p><p>You will learn how to use the scientific process as you work through <a href="../../DOCUMENT/HTML/CONTENTS.HTM">the lesson plans. </a>Working through the lessons in the order they are presented on the CD isnot necessary. However, by doing so, you will learn about NASA's Mission toPlanet Earth program. Questions such as <i>how do we study the Earth as a system?,why do we take this approach in studying the Earth?,</i>and <i>how do we use the datagathered from SIR-C to assist us? </i>will be addressed. Finally, you will learnhow radar data can be used to assist in managing Earth's resources.<p><p>As you proceed through the lessons, you will study specific examples of the Earth.You'll learn about the physical characteristic of radar, how radar instrumentswork, and how radar data is used. At the end of your study, you willhave gained a better understanding of how the dynamic processes of Earthinteract. Our objective is for you to have fun while learning about radar andthe Earth.<p></font><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td><A HREF="HOWTOUSE.HTM">How Do I Use The CD?</A>   </td>   <td><A HREF="../GUIDTOUR.HTM">Guided Tour</A>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<H1>HOW TO OBTAIN SPACEBORNE IMAGING RADAR-C/X-BAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SIR-C/X-SAR) MATERIALS
</H1>
</B>
<HR>
<P>
This information sheet explains how NASA photographs, slides, mission status information, and CD-ROMs produced by the SIR-C/X-SAR Project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  can be obtained by educators and the general public.   SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint US/German/Italian mission which will fly aboard the space shuttle in April and August, 1994 as part of the Space Radar Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The Space Radar Laboratory, part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, is studying how our global environment is changing.  From the unique vantage point of space, SIR-C/X-SAR will observe, monitor, and assess large-scale environmental processes with a focus on climate change.  The spaceborne data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists highly detailed information which will help them distinguish natural environmental changes from those that are the result of human activity.

Comparison of SIR-C Simulated and Measured SIR-C SAR Image Spectra with Ocean
Wave Spectra Derived from Buoys and Wave Production Models in the North Sea<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Carry out measurements of two-dimensional ocean wave spectra by a pitch and
roll buoy from the Forschungsplatform Nordsee (German Research Platform North
Sea) and from a ship of the German Hydrographic Office in the North Sea.
Collaborate with of North Sea oil rig operators to obtain wave spectra from
these sites. <p>
<p>
	b)	A third generation wave prediction model (WAMODEL) will be applied to
forecast, respectively hindcast, the wavefields in the North Sea from the
measured wind history during the SIR-C overflight.  The WAMODEL has a
resolution of 0.5 degrees longitude and 0.25 degrees latitude.  This model
(Komen and Zambreski, 1986; Bauer et al., 1988) seems to be accurate in
predicting two-dimensional ocean wave spectra in the North Sea and will be
refined for the SIR-C mission. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Compare two-dimensional wave spectra measured by buoys and calculated from
the wave prediction model (WAMODEL) over the entire North Sea (and Atlantic)
with the X-, C-, and L-Band SAR image intensity spectra of SIR-C. <p>
<p>
	b)	Apply SAR imaging theory (Alpers and Rufenach, 1979, Alpers et al., 1981;
Alpers, 1983; Alpers and Bruning, 1988; Alpers et al., 1986; Bruning et al.,
1988a, 1988b) to the measured and predicted ocean wave spectra to predict the
X-, C-, and L-Band SAR image spectra of SIR-C. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Determine the accuracy of the SAR wave imaging theory to both measured and
predicted 		ocean wave spectra in the North Sea.<p>
<p>
	b)	Determination of the optimum hydrologic and meterologic conditions for
routine mapping of sea bottom topography using SAR data.<p>

Wave Dynamics in the Southern Ocean<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Construct a spatially continuous daily estimate of the directional wave
energy transport across the only pure ocean circumpolar route on the planet, a
route that is just to the south of the net source function (i.e., south of the
maximum wind zone).<p>
<p>
	b)	Determine the temporal and spatial variability of the directional wave
transport in the study area over the mission.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Collect a total of 96 three-minute data-takes with C-band HH polarization,
south-looking at 25deg. incidence angle.  This geometry will permit the
acquisition of a contiguous sequence of six complete circumpolar data sets at
58deg.S, nearly centered on the narrow Drake passage. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	From this data set, and by extending our L-band algorithms developed and
verified with SIR-B, we will:<p>
<p>
	a)	Estimate the angular distribution of total wave energy flux through the
58deg.S latitude circle and partition the total energy into sixteen 22.5deg.
longitude zones;<p>
<p>
	b)	Determine the temporal and spatial variability of the directional wave
energy transport in each of the 22.5deg. zones over the total mission duration;
and<p>
<p>
	c)	Calculate the angular distribution of total wave energy transport versus
longitude by normalizing the (relative) spectra with the mean monthly wave
height determined from Geosat altimeter averages, which are essentially
invariant from year to year (based on 1985 to 1987 data). <p>

Multi-Incidence Angle/Multi-Frequency Effect in Satellite SAR Imagery
Pertaining to Vegetation Characterization and Hydrology<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Evaluate the range of incidence angles over which radar backscatter is
predominately from the underlying soil, the vegetation canopy, and a
combination of the two as a function of frequency and polarization; develop
models to characterize the backscatter.<p>
<p>
	b)	Evaluate the synergism of VIR and SIR-C/X-SAR data for crop type
discrimination and as an input to remote sensing/meteorological crop yield
models.<p>
<p>
	c)	Evaluate SIR-C/X-SAR data for soil moisture and as an input to watershed
run-off prediction models.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Acquisition of multi-frequency, multi-incidence angle, multi-polarization
SIR-C/X-SAR data in a summer month for vegetation condition and soil moisture
assessment, and in a winter month for assessment of snowpack characteristics.<p>
<p>
	b)	Use ARCs and a ground-based scatterometer for absolute calibration of
SIR-C/X-SAR imagery.<p>
<p>
	c)	Collect airborne SAR, satellite VIR imagery, and intensive ground data
collection to support SIR-C/X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
	d)	Statistical and graphical evaluation of summer SIR-C imagery to isolate
changes in backscatter as functions of frequency, incidence angle, and
polarization; identify optimum imaging parameters for vegetation
characterization and soil moisture assessment.<p>
<p>
	e)	Statistical comparison of near-coincident and temporally different SAR and
VIR imagery to determine the degree of synergism/redundancy between the two
data types for crop discrimination and condition assessment.<p>
<p>
	f)	Introduction of SAR and VIR imagery (alone and in combination) as
surrogates for Leaf Area Index (LAI) in crop yield models and for soil moisture
in watershed runoff hydrologic models.<p>
<p>
	g)	Statistical and graphical evaluation of winter SIR-C imagery for snowpack
characteristics; assess the feasibility of using SAR imagery as an input to
watershed runoff models during periods of snow melt.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	At L-band and at small incidence angles for X- and C-band the radar
backscatter will be predominantly correlated to soil parameters.<p>
<p>
	b)	Crop yield model performance will improve with the introduction of SAR
radar backscatter values as a surrogate for LAI.<p>
<p>
	c)	SAR and VIR data used together will improve crop discrimination over the
use of VIR data acquired at a non-optimal period in vegetation development.<p>
<p>
	d)	SAR data will be highly correlated to soil moisture at small incidence
angles and, as an input to watershed runoff models, will improve the
predictions.<p>

Contribution of SAR for Estimating Soil Erosion<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVE<p>
<p>
	a)	This research aims to evaluate SAR potential in the study of soil erosion
problems.<p>
<p>
	b)	Investigate the contributions of SAR images in reconstructing different
stages of transport and redeposition of material on watershed slopes, using
models which take into consideration several parameters of soil surface
(moisture content, roughness, vegetation cover, etc.) that can be extracted
from radar backscattering.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Extraction of hydrological parameters from SAR data.<p>
<p>
	b)	Validation of erosion models based on SAR data.<p>
<p>
	c)	During the SIR-C/X-SAR mission, the following ground truth parameters will
be measured in two sub-areas of the Montespertoli test site chosen for detailed
experiments:<p>

<p>
	a)	Estimate snow-covered area and distribution of snow water equivalence over
alpine drainage basins.  Surface material may be trees that are taller than the

or bedrock, or glacier ice.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Estimate spectral albedo of snow cover.<p>
<p>
	c)	Model spatial distribution of snow surface energy exchange, melt rate, and
snow metamorphism intensively during two-to-four-week periods around
SIR-C/X-SAR flights, and less intensively during rest of snow season.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Use three frequencies on SIR-C/X-SAR to estimate snow water equivalence for
dry snow and possibly for wet snow.  Use co-registered digital elevation data,
derived from low-altitude aerial photographs, from SPOT stereographic coverage,
or contour maps, to correct for topographic effects in radar data.  Validate
measurements with intensive snow surveys coincident with SIR-C flights, and
with scatterometer measurements at one site.  To insure that results are not
site-specific, field and satellite investigations will be carried out in three
different mountain ranges with different climates: Sierra Nevada (California),
Swiss Alps, and Tien Shan (Xinjiang, northwest China).  We also plan to acquire
satellite data, but no field measurement s, for a test site in the Himalaya
(Tibet, southwest China).<p>
<p>
	b)	Use optical sensor data to estimate grain size of surface snow layer and
its contamination by impurities (e.g. dust or soot).  Use these parameters to
extend albedo throughout the solar spectrum.  AVIRIS data will be requested for
US. sites and Landsat data for foreign sites.<p>
<p>
	c)	Use frequencies from SIR-C/X-SAR, especially 9.6 GHz, to detect wet snow
and estimate liquid-water content, and possibly to identify dry snowpacks with
a wet surface layer and wet snowpacks with a dry surface layer.<p>
<p>
	d)	Use satellite or aircraft data, local micrometeorological data, and digital
elevation grids to derive basin-wide energy balance model of snowpack.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Evaluate the ability to continuously monitor and model processes in the
Earth's alpine snow cover, thus demonstrating the possibility of achieving an
important objective that could be supported by the Earth Observing System
(EOS).<p>
<p>
	b)	SIR-C measurements of the snow cover will be carefully calibrated with
physical measurements of snow characteristics, thus providing excellent data

Alluvial Fan Evolution in the Western Great Basin<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Describe systematic morphologic changes with surface age in terms of
multiparameter radar backscatter for dated chronosequences on alluvial fans at
one or two sites in the western Great Basin.  Compare these changes to chemical
weathering patterns observed for the same fans using visible/near-infrared
(VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) images.<p>
<p>
	b)	Construct a depositional and weathering history for the studied alluvial
fans based on SAR, other images, and field investigations; use this to
constrain paleoclimatic interpretations for the Great Basin.  Use project as
prototype for paleoclimate study of entire Great Basin or other geomorphic
provinces, where multiparameter SAR data can be acquired regionally.<p>
<p>
	c)	Test the application of spectral mixing analysis on multiparameter SAR
images of alluvial fans in arid and semiarid regions.  Define radar endmembers
(from the spectral mixing analysis) physically, in terms of Bragg scattering,
volume scattering, specular and corner reflectors, and dielectric constant,
etc.  Develop and test mixing models for comparative analysis of images
spanning multiple spectral regions.  <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>

	a)	Select study site(s) in Owens Valley/Death Valley to exploit existing
geomorphic, soils, and geochronology data, for a sequence of alluvial fans
deposited during the last 0.5 Ma.<p>
<p>
	b)	Compare spectral differences in VNIR, TIR, and SIR-C SAR images in terms of
systematic chemical and morphological differences predicted by current
weathering models, given the known ages of the fan surfaces.  Make precise
measurements of integrated weathering rates for each dated surface, which can
then be analyzed jointly to construct a history of weathering rates and rate
changes for selected parameters (e.g., oxidation, hydration, clast
disintegration and aeolian silt redistribution).<p>
<p>
	c)	Interpret weathering-rate history in terms of climatic factors that promote
weathering (e.g., temperatures, precipitation and excess moisture, wind
velocity).  <p>
<p>
	d)	Collect and independently analyze VNIR, TIR, and airborne SAR images of the
study site(s) prior to the mission to test spectral mixing models applied to

II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	We propose to use Landes forest, near Bordeaux, South East of France as a test
site.  Previous work in this area has established an existing dataset.
Inversion algorithms developed on the test-site will be applied to SIR-C/X-SAR
data acquired on other sites in the world including coniferous forest sites.
It is proposed to relate SIR-C/X-SAR data to vegetation parameters and to
develop an inversion algorithm as follows:<p>
<p>
	a)	Theoretical model(s) will be developed and validated by experiments
performed with airborne and laboratory systems.<p>

Analysis of Optical and Microwave Data to Assess Dynamics of Mexican Tropical
Rain Forest<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
		The major objective of this research are to analyze the effect of structural
differences and successional stages of the tropical forest, on multispectral,
multipolarized and multiple incidence angle data.  <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Monitor deforestation processes in tropical regions, in terms of the actual
distribution and the dynamics of deforestation.  This requires assessing the
temporal variations of the forest.<p>
<p>
	b)	Monitoring phenological variation during the annual cycle, as well as
long-term analysis.  This can only be accomplished by establishing data bases
that provide accurate information in a timely manner.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
			This research will provide basic information about the relationship between
forest parameters and spectral response, radar return, and signal polarization.
This project will also derive methodologies that will enable the estimation of
tropical deforestation and distinguish the primary forest from the different
successional stages. <p>

The Exploration and Reconstruction of the Middle to Late Cenozoic Drainages of
the Sahara by Means of the SIR-C Mapping<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR data in a synoptic mode with other remotely sensed data,
field, and cartographic data to map relic Cenozoic drainage systems across the
Sahara from the Red Sea Hills, Egypt, to the Chad Basin and Atlantic Ocean.<p>
<p>
	b)	Demonstrate applicability of SIR data, used with Landsat, SPOT and
high-altitude photographic data, as a new, cost-effective remote geophysical
tool for exploration geology. <p>
<p>
	c)	Produce a major report on the distribution of paleodrainages in the Sahara,
their relations to the basic tectonic elements of North Africa (basins and
swells), and their economic potential.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Obtain ancillary  data including local maps, seismic and drill hole logs,
and reports of local researchers, with help of Egyptian and French
co-investigators.<p>
<p>
	b)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR along with Landsat, SPOT, and other data to map Tertiary
stream courses in areas obscured by windblown sand along gaps between
identified paleodrainage segments.  Apply results of SIR-A/B image data
analyses for well-documented sites in Egypt and Sudan to the interpretation of
SIR-C/X-SAR radar images along putative courses of paleodrainages.  Analysis of
headcut patterns in the Mesozoic and older rocks of this region are the key to
this work.<p>
<p>
	c)	Conduct field investigations at critical sites where Cenozoic fluvial
deposits (e.g., old stream sand and gravels) are known or are likely to occur.
(Outside support from local and US. agencies in African countries will be
solicited for detailed subsurface exploration work.)<p>
<p>
	d)	Assess SIR-C signal behavior as it affects our subsurface mapping
capability.  Fully utilize SIR-C/X-SAR regioal mapping capability.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Major contribution to the knowledge of erosional events from middle to late
Tertiary time, which gave rise to the Quaternary geomorphology of North Africa.
Hot humid conditions prevailed during most of the Tertiary, whereas progressive
desiccation set in during the Quaternary.  The effects of this major climatic
shift were to preserve the evidence for earlier geologic events beneath a
veneer of windblown sand.  SIR-C/X-SAR's ability to see through these dry sands
makes our proposed work feasible.<p>
<p>
	b)	A major report will be prepared with accompanying maps that we hope will
have broad scientific and economic applications (for both the public and
private sectors).  Prior work in this region has been limited in scope and
uneven in quality because of the regions heritage of political fragmentation.
SIR-C/X-SAR provides an opportunity for a multi-national effort of regional
synthesis for the Saudi Arabian Peninsula.<p>

types, in the presence and absence of standing water.<p>
<p>
	c)	Exploit the multitemporal capability of SIR-C/X-SAR to isolate the effect
of standing water under the forest canopy from the effect of vegetation by

stages, and leaf-on/leaf-off status.<p>
<p>
	d)	Determine detectability threshold of discontinuous floodplain inundation.

U. S. Navy Investigations<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	As part of the SIR-C/X-SAR experiment, the US. Navy intends to conduct
several scientific remote sensing investigations through extensive synthetic

<p>
	b)	To determine how much the vertical antenna pattern changes after launch to

needed on all future space radars. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Measure backscatter from areas that are uniform in the large scale,

The Eruptive Styles of Basaltic Shield Volcanoes from Shuttle Imaging Radar-C
(SIR-C) and X-SAR Data<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
	a)	To provide a comprehensive understanding of  the distribution of volcanic
materials on classic examples of basaltic shield volcanoes in Hawaii, Reunion
Island (Indian Ocean) and Galapagos (Eastern Pacific).<p>
<p>
	b) 	Interpret the preserved eruptive history of each volcano, draw contrasts
between each test site in terms of the role of the tectonic setting on basaltic
volcanism, and make inferences about the internal structure of the volcano and
its magma chamber. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Develop criteria for the discrimination of volcanic materials (lava flow
types and ash deposits) using multi-parameter SIR-C/X-SAR data.  Determine the
optimum frequencies, polarizations and incidence angles from the first
SIR-C/X-SAR mission, and obtain data for each volcano during the second mission
in mapping-mode with fixed radar parameters.  Aircraft SAR data from NASA's
DC-8 will be used to help develop these optimum radar parameters, as will field
measurements of local topography and dielectric constant.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Investigate the complete radar scattering matrix for the volcanic surfaces,
using the phase information contained within the quad-pol SIR-C data.  The
radar data will be used to map the distribution of volcanic materials, and
these maps will then be interpreted by both photogeologic and field methods to
assess the style(s) of emplacement of lava flows and ash deposits at each test
site.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED  RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a) 	If Kilauea volcano is still active during the mission, we expect to test
the first near real-time tracking of an active lava flow using radar.  Radar
scattering work in Hawaii will allow us to quantify the types of lavas seen on
other terrestrial volcanoes, thereby permitting an assessment of the eruption
rate of magma on some less well studied volcanoes.	<p>
<p>
	b)	Work in the Galapagos will permit details of the structure and eruptive
history of the seven active volcanoes to be interpreted and compared to active
volcanoes in Hawaii and the Reunion Islands.  Maps of lava flows, craters,
fissures, etc. of the volcanoes in Kamchatka will greatly improve our knowledge
of these poorly known volcanoes.<p>
<p>
	c)	Compare the roles of tectonic setting and spatial variations in activity in
a way that has not been possible before using a uniform data set for physically
separated landforms. <p>
<p>
	d)	To obtain this regional view, we will develop radar scattering models that
enable us to take local test data and extrapolate these observations to the
regional scale.  Such methods are deemed to be particularly important as the
geologic community prepares itself not only to study geographically-isolated
terrestrial landforms using ERS-1, JERS-1, and EOS data sets, but also in the
analysis of planetary volcanic terrains such as those investigated on Venus by
NASA's Magellan spacecraft.<p>

I.	OBJECTIVES<p>

		The proposed experiments will evaluate the capabilities of multiple parameter
spaceborne SAR in geological, agricultural, and oceanological applications at
the Campanian Test Site (Southern Italy).<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
		The proposed research aims at a large scale and multidisciplinary study of
the whole region, using the specific acquaintances and synergistic studies of

SAR data and optical imagery is planned.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
		It is expected that by using L, C, and X band imagery, all the necessary
information on the geometry of the area will be obtained.  The aim of the
research is a regional reconstruction of the structural and volcano tectonics
setting and its correlation with plate-tectonics and earthquake epicenter.
This will permit the drawing of updated structural and hydrogeological maps.<p>

Global Biodiversity:  Assessment of Habitat Change and Species Extinctions with
Multiparameter Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
	a)	Study the impact of tropical forest fragmentation on local populations of
endangered and threatened species of certain mammals, butterflies, birds, and
plants.  Vegetation information from SIR-C/X-SAR data over three
tropical-forest intensive-study sites will aid an independent, broader study of
forest fragmentation and its effects on biodiversity.<p>
<p>
	b)	Add the unique, detailed information on forest fragmentation from
spacecraft-based SAR to the broader study begun in 1988. <p>
<p>
	c)	Use imaging data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Advanced Very-High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to assess on a biome scale, but with less spatial
resolution than that of the SIR-C/X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
	d)	Evaluate the use of the unique information about forest distributions and
stand conditions expected from multiparameter synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
relative to that from the MSS and AVHRR. <p>
<p>
II.  APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Species diversity and population dynamics are affected by the size, degree
of isolation, and condition of forest habitats.(e.g., due to cultural
deforestation or natural disturbances such as fire).  The broader project will
predict the changes in endangerment status of mammals, birds, butterflies, and
certain plant groups in the subject tropical areas.  To assess the impact of
remotely-sensed forest changes, the investigators in the broader study will use
a combination of ecological simulation modeling, biogeographic theory, a global
georeferenced database of species occurrence, abundance, and habitat
preferences, and field data on the response of subject species to habitat
fragmentation. <p>
<p>
	b)	While much information is expected from the independent study through the
use of data from the MSS and AVHRR, SIR-C/X-SAR data will provide unique
information about forest conditions.  A biome-wide study using SAR could not be
done with the limited SIR-C/X-SAR data (taken over two one-week periods); this
broader application of SAR data, if proven feasible in the SIR-C/X-SAR project,
would have to await EOS SAR or other long-term radar systems to be in Earth
orbit in the 1990's and beyond. <p>
<p>
		1.	Specifically, data from the multiparameter SIR-C SAR [especially from
L-band multipolarization channels] will be useful in distinguishing between
closed forest (100% canopy closure), woodland (50-99% canopy closure), open
woodland (10-49% canopy closure), shrub land, and grassland.  Furthermore, we
expect quantitative information on early forest regrowth.<p>
<p>
		2.	Recent results (Ulaby, et al., 1986) from studies of textural information
in a block of SAR pixels suggests that forests of different types and stages of
maturity may have qualitative differences in textural properties useful for
forest-habitat characterization.  Differentiation of successional stages of
recovery in the tropics will add to model precision, both for the biodiversity
project and for other research goals.  Also, if standing water exists beneath
forests, L-band SAR data often responds (presents a brighter image) in a way
that such areas can be delineated.<p>
<p>
III.  ANTICIPATED RESULTS <p>
<p>
	a)	Provide valuable, relatively high spatial resolution information about
forest fragmentation conditions for use in refining such estimates based on MSS
and AVHRR data. <p>
<p>
	b)	Provide valuable insight into the extended and broader area usage of
spacecraft SAR data (e.g., from the EOS SAR) for studies of tropical forest
type classification, biodiversity, and species loss in future years (i.e.,
during the EOS era). <p>
<p>
	c)	Promote the use of remotely-sensed data for the study of an important
ecological issue -- the impact of cultural activities on forest habitats and on
the threatened and endangered species that reside in these. <p>

data.  These data will be used to identify coherent structures and establish
relationships between turbulent flow statistics. <p>
<p>
		2.	A higher-order closure model describing the soil-plant atmosphere
continuum will be used to interpret the data. <p>
<p>
	b)	We will determine the feasibility of using SIR-C/X-SAR data for measuring
the canopy structure in field experiments coupled with (a). <p>
<p>
		1.	SIR-C/X-SAR data will be corrected.  Microwave and TM (or other optical
data) will be used to produce a canopy structure map. <p>
<p>
		2.	The utility of SIR-C/X-SAR, ground-based microwave, and aircraft-based SAR
data will be evaluated using conventional measures of canopy structure. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS <p>
<p>
	a)	The fluxes of gases, momentum, and heat from vegetated surfaces will be
estimated with greater accuracy using the results of the micrometeorological
experiments. <p>
<p>
	b)	The effects of canopy structure and roughness on turbulence and fluxes will
be established. <p>
<p>
	c)	Limitations of using microwave data to measure plant structure will be
identified.  Recommendations for future instrument usage and design will be
made. <p>

nominally winter SIR-C/X-SAR flight, and is centered upon the edge of the
marginal ice zone off the coast of Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean.  The
second site corresponds to a nominally summer SIR-C/X-SAR flight, and is off
the West coast of Vancouver Island near the entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait in
the Pacific Ocean.  The third site is in the Tasman Sea and the fourth site is
the East Australia Current.  These four study sites will present a variety of
ocean features and conditions for study in a multi-sensor experiment.  <p>
<p>
	b)	The ocean wave analysis will center around conversion of SAR imagery into
reliable directional wave height spectra.  Particular emphasis will be placed
upon inter-sensor comparisons, and the inclusion of optimal SAR processing
schemes such as adaptive multi-look processing and the explicit inclusion of
noncoherent scene motion effects.  <p>
<p>
	c)	Mesoscale ocean features will be tracked via AVHRR imagery and subsequently
searched for in the resulting SAR imagery.  Internal gravity wave signatures
will be analyzed for wavelength and corresponding propagation velocities will
be compared with those predicted by <i>in situ</i> CTD surveys.  Wind
signatures will be searched for in the data and correlated with the winds
predicted by surface pressure maps.  Ship detection exercises will be based
upon observations of the research vessels present in the study site, and any
chance observations of icebergs in the winter study site.  <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Improved understanding of the SAR imaging of ocean surface waves,
particularly the dependence of aspects of the SAR geometry, operating
configurations, and SAR processing upon the image fidelity of surface gravity
waves with an azimuthal wavenumber component.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Optimal SAR geometries and processing schemes for the observation of
internal waves, mesoscale features, wind signatures, and hard targets in sea
clutter will be established.<p>

Imaging Radar Data Analysis for Forest Ecosystem Modeling<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
		The overall objective of this proposed work is to capitalize on and develop
the unique advantages of satellite imaging radar data combined with models of
forest ecosystem dynamics for characterizing northern/boreal forest ecosystems,
especially with regard to the interpretation of landscape patterns and
processes at local and regional scales.  Specific objectives are: <p>
<p>
	a)	Use radar observations to help infer where landscape pattern and process
ecosystem models succeed or fail at regional spatial scales and inter-annual
temporal scales. <p>
<p>
	b)	Use radar data to check potentially observable forest ecosystem model
predicted attributes.<p>
<p>
	c)	Use radar observations and models to extract biophysical properties of
forest canopies, soils and hydrologic parameters used in our forest ecosystem
models. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Use standard SAR image processing and analysis techniques (e.g., to first
extract radar channels and then map the changes in composition, species and gap
size distributions) to characterize ecosystem states over selected and modeled
study sites.  AIRSAR aircraft missions over our intensive sites will be used to
guide our later satellite radar analyses.<p>
<p>
	b)	Analyses of field and aircraft data collected over our study sites will be
used to explore quasi-statistical relationships between measured response and
ecosystem attributes.  These relationships may then be applied to satellite
collected data to make more detailed checks on ecosystem model performance. <p>
<p>
	c)	Physically based radar models will be applied to existing and field
collected data over subsets of our study sites to examine radar and optical
scattering from different scene components, useful for objectives a) and b)
above, and to develop model inversion strategies for selected ecosystem model
input parameters. <p>
<p>
III. 	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	The utility of space-borne SAR for guiding the conditions under which
ecosystem model assumptions can be relaxed, or conversely, where new mechanisms
must be incorporated into models applied at these relatively unexplored spatial
scales will be demonstrated. <p>
<p>
	b)	A further tool for evaluating detailed model processes will be explored
especially in the regional spatial domain where more traditional methods are
difficult to apply. <p>
<p>
	c)	Extract canopy structural parameters from radar observations which can be
applied to optical radiative transfer models important for calculating the
internal and external radiation regime, or vice versa.<p>

	<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To determine the optimum SIR sensor configuration for detection of desert
duricrust and to use this understanding to reconstruct the paleoclimatic
history of two large desert regions in Africa.  <p>
<p>
	b)	To determine the ability of SIR-C/X-SAR (alone and synergistically with

<p>
	a)	Conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR study at the Bebedouro Irrigation Project in

SIR-C Studies of the Precambrian Hamisana and Nakasib Structures, NE Sudan, in
Arid Regions of Low Relief and in the Subsurface<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Develop techniques for optimizing structural analysis of basement trends in
arid regions with extremely subdued topography and/or thin aeolian cover.<p>
<p>
	b)	Apply results of a) to map the southern extension of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and the western extension of Nakasib Suture.<p>
<p>
	c)	Apply results of b) to constrain the roles of terrane accretion and
strike-slip re-organization for late Precambrian crustal evolution in NE
Africa.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Pre- and post-mission field studies will focus on defining the major
basement structures of the NE Sudan to determine their deformational history
and orientation of structural fabrics.<p>
<p>
	b)	Interface with ongoing LANDSAT TM and field studies of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and initiate similar studies for the Nakasib Suture.  Ancillary data is
also requested (i.e., hand-held photography, large format camera).<p>
<p>
	c)	During the first SIR-C/X-SAR flight, we will determine the best
configuration of radar parameters for resolving the structures in the study
area.  The following will assist in this determination.<p>
<p>
		1.	Dual frequency (L-and C-band or L- and X-band), like polarized (V-V or
H-H).  Penetration is inversely proportional to frequency, so comparison of L
with C- or X-bands should allow discrimination of surface vs. subsurface
effects.<p>
<p>
		2.	Single frequency (L-band), dual polarization (V-V or H-H) and (V-H or
H-V).  This will allow examination of possible polarization effects in
subsurface and near-surface features.<p>
<p>
		3.	Incidence angle should be as high as possible, to mimic as much as
possible a SEASAT imaging configuration.  This will maximize weak returns off
the subsurface and will enhance subtle topographic features in this low relief
terrain.  Some of these may have structural significance due to preferential
erosion.<p>
<p>
	d)	Second flight experiment should get coverage over the same area using
approaches iv) a) and b), to the extent possible to determine the best
configuration for the subsequent experiment.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Better understanding of the southern continuation of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and the western continuation of the Nakasib Suture and the sequence of
deformational events (collisions, strike slip faulting, etc) that led to the
formation of the continental crust of this poorly known region.  This will
better constrain models linking the major basement structures of NE Africa and
those of the Mozambique Belt of East Africa.<p>
<p>
	b)	Better understanding of the imaging techniques necessary for elucidating
buried and low-relief structures in arid terrains.<p>
<p>
	c)	Better understanding of the radar signature of suture zones and strike-slip
zones of deformation in terrains and climates analogous to those expected on
planetary surfaces such as Venus.<p>

The Evaluation of SIR-C Imagery for Surficial Sediment Mapping and Groundwater
Management in Australia<p>
<p>
I.  OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To assess the utility of multipolarization multifrequency spaceborne radar
for  surficial  sediment  mapping  (4.2.5.3.  lithology, rock weathering and
geochronology, Science Plan) and groundwater management (4.3.5.1, arid regimes,
Science Plan) in a variety of Australian environments. <p>
<p>
	b)	To establish the utility of the SIR-C imagery for recognizing basement
structures (4.2.5.4, tectonics and geologic boundaries, Science Plan) by
mapping drape-related fractures in overlying surficial sediments. <p>
<p>
II.  APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Sites have been selected across Australia so as to cover a range of
sedimentary environments from arid to temperate. <p>
<p>
	b)	Sites at Kerang, Palm Valley, Fowlers Gap, Cooper Creek, Lake Eyre and
Condobolin contain Precambrian and Devonian sediment outcrops, Tertiary and
Quaternary sediments, and fresh and saltwater lake systems.  A large data base
of remotely sensed imagery covering these regions is already available. <p>
<p>
	c)	The study will involve image analysis and enhancement.  Detailed ground
investigations will involve petrology, surface roughness determinations,
moisture measurements, dielectric constant determinations, salinity analyses,
and signal calibration. <p>
<p>
	d)	Studies will be extended along swath into differing hydrological
environments each with particular water-management problems.  Sites within the
Murray Darling Basin, Cooper Creek/Diamantina Rivers and Simpson Desert will be
included. <p>
<p>
	e)	Block faulting in Devonian to Cretaceous age sediments in petroleum bearing
sediments in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins is propagated upwards into
overlying Tertiary to recent sediment cover.  Comparative studies of these
drape-related features employing lineament analyses from several remotely
sensed data bases and the SIR-C/X-SAR imagery will be carried out at
along-swath study sites. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Map surficial deposits of different type and age by surface roughness,
sub-surface volume scattering, cross-polarization returns and phase difference
images.  These maps will have important consequences for the recognition of
potential aquifer materials in arid and semi-arid regions. <p>
<p>
	b)	Map seepage zones in areas of internal drainage and saltlake formation
using variations in dielectric constant to determine moisture contents and
conducting salt layers.  These maps will be important to understanding natural
salt-lake systems and salinity management in irrigation areas such as the
Murray Darling Basin and elsewhere in the world. <p>
<p>
	c)	Demonstrate that spaceborne radar is a powerful tool for mapping basement
tectonic features through overlying surficial sediments.  While having
implications for petroleum exploration, this will also be important for
recognizing high permeability zones for the siting of water wells. <p>
<p>
	d)	Test the effect on varying amounts of vegetation cover on our ability to
achieve these results. <p>

Polarimetric Radar Observations of Forest State for Determination of Ecosystem
Process<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	The objectives of this research are to test the hypotheses that
ecologically significant forest state parameters may be estimated from SAR
data.  These include estimation of above ground biomass, plant water status,
and near surface soil moisture under certain forest conditions.<p>
<p>
	b)	Test hypotheses in the northern hardwoods forest community, refine them if
necessary, and establish techniques for retrieving this information from
orbital SARs such as SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	The study will be conducted in three phases as follows:<p>
<p>
		1.  Monitor the dielectric and geometric properties of selected forest
canopies on a diurnal and seasonal basis.  Use these values to simulate radar
backscatter as a function of frequency, polarization, incidence angle, and
range into the canopy as a function of time using the Michigan Microwave Canopy
Scattering Model (MIMICS).  Simulations will be evaluated on the basis of
concurrent multifrequency, polarimetric backscatter observations using
AIRSAR.<p>
<p>
		2.  Refine initial hypotheses on the basis of sensitivity studies generated
using MIMICS for a range of forest stand conditions existing at the test site
area near the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS).  Studies will
use databases established at UMBS over the last 78 years.  An airborne SAR
program will be conducted prior to SIR-C/X-SAR to test these hypotheses under
heterogeneous field conditions and evaluate retrieval techniques derived from
inversions of the MIMICS model.<p>
<p>
		3.  Demonstrate the utility and the lateral geographic extendibility of these
retrieval techniques beyond the study region using SIR-C/X-SAR data.  Issues of
sensor calibration are critical to this phase and on-site external calibration
techniques will therefore be applied throughout the experimental program.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Determination of the dynamic range of radar backscatter from northern
hardwood canopies in response to diurnal, daily, and seasonal dynamics.<p>
<p>
	b)	Validation of a robust forest canopy scattering model (MIMICS) which can
then be applied to other forest conditions.<p>
<p>
	c)	Definition of the retrieval techniques and their respective accuracies.
Evaluate the limitations for each hypothesis.<p>

<p>
	c)	The multiangle capability and/or a slight shift between successive orbits
will provide images of the test area under different illumination angles. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>

campaigns to design, test, and operate a set of ad-hoc multifrequency
instrumentation for SAR calibration and data validation.<p>

processor parameters.<p>
<p>

SIR-C Measurements of Soil Moisture, Vegetation and Surface Roughness, and
their Hydrological Application<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Analysis of SIR-C/X-SAR response to soil moisture, vegetation and surface
roughness and development of an algorithm to retrieve these parameters.<p>
<p>
	b)	Combination of the visible and near-infrared data and the SIR-C/X-SAR data
to improve the range and accuracy of vegetation classification.<p>
<p>
	c)	Testing of theoretical models for microwave propagation with SIR-C/X-SAR
and microwave radiometric measurements over rough surfaces.<p>
<p>
	d)	Evaluation of a water balance model using SIR-C/X-SAR derived soil moisture
values and other ancillary data. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Selection of a test site which would provide a wide spectrum of soil
moisture, vegetation and surface roughness for SIR-C/X-SAR observations.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Request of aircraft polarimeter and radiometer flights before and during
the SIR-C/X-SAR mission. <p>
<p>
	c)	Activities of the ground truth data collection, as well as other relevant
satellite and ancillary data acquisitions.<p>
<p>
	d)	Processing of data from SIR-C/X-SAR, satellite, and aircraft flights.
Analysis of microwave signatures with respect to surface parameters leading to
algorithm development for parameter retrieval.  Evaluation of a generalized
water balance model using the retrieved soil moisture and other ancillary
data.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	The relationship between surface parameters and imaging radar signatures
will be established.  An algorithm based on this relationship to retrieve the
surface parameters will be developed. <p>
<p>
	b)	Verify that an imaging radar system with multiple frequencies and
polarizations is an efficient tool for vegetation classification.  Assessment
will be made of the classification scheme improvement when visible and
near-infrared data are included. <p>
<p>

Information Extraction from Shuttle Radar Images for Forest Applications<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVE<p>
<p>
	a)	The experiment will attempt to extract all possible information from
shuttle borne radar images (SAR) for areas with forest stands.<p>
<p>
	b)	Use extracted information to evaluate/characterize forest parameters
including differentiation between coniferous and deciduous forests, tree stand
geometry, seasonal changes.  Specific radar-tree interaction schemes including
dependence of leaf/needle geometry and alignment to radar backscatter will also
be investigated.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Forested areas to be studied in the experiment will comprise the range from
non-forest/deforested areas to bushland areas, reforested areas and finally,
small groves to large woodlands. <p>
<p>
	b)	The experiment and the proposed data processing algorithms will utilize
mainly the X-band SAR data in one polarization, but will also take advantage of
the SIR-C L- and C-band data with different polarization and look-angles. <p>
<p>
	c)	The experiment will use geocoded images to co-register the radar data with
other geocoded satellite-borne images including multiband TM data and high
resolution  SPOT data.  The strong dependence of radar data on topographic
relief will make the incorporation of digital elevation models (DEM) necessary.
<p>
<p>
	d)	To obtain information for forest applications the principal backscatter
mechanisms of microwaves with trees, trunks, leaves, and needles must be known.
Three main parameters can be identified:<p>
<p>
		1.	<i>Radar parameters:</i> These are wavelength, polarization and incidence
angle.  The SIR-C/X-SAR mission will vary all parameters, delivering a maximum
flexibility to the investigators. <p>
<p>
		2.	<i>Target parameters:</i>  These can be further sub-divided in geometric
parameters such as roughness, density, pattern, height, and dielectric property
parameters which are mainly influenced by the moisture content of the canopy.
Especially the tree/forest geometry could allow a classification of different
species from SAR images. <p>
<p>
		3.	<i>Underlying soil parameters:</i>  Mainly the surface roughness and the
dielectric properties of the soil which are governed by humidity. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Differentiation of forested and non-forested areas with an assessment of
the accuracy of separation.<p>
<p>
	b)	Information on the tree stand geometry, age classes of trees, and seasonal
changes.<p>

SIR-C Radar Investigations of Volcanism and Tectonism in the Northern Andes<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVE<p>
<p>
	a)	Increase understanding of the volcano-tectonic history of the Northern
Andes of Colombia and Ecuador by testing and extending the volcano-tectonic
segmentation model proposed by Hall and Wood (1985).<p>
<p>
	b)	Develop radar models for detecting and mapping pyroclastic and mudflow
deposits at Ruiz and other dangerous volcanoes of the Northern Andes.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR images to examine areas identified by Hall and Wood as
having anomalous volcano-tectonic characteristics; e.g., determine if young
volcanoes uncertainly glimpsed in Landsat images of south-central Colombia
exist; search for caldera (?) source of extensive, young ashflows in southern
Ecuador; map tectonic details of surface area above apparent collision of
adjacent subducted slabs.<p>
<p>
	b)	For forested volcanic areas, develop statistical characterizations of
terrain morphologies (canopy morphologies) to recognize and classify
volcaniclastic terranes of various ages.  For vegetation-free areas, develop
theoretical scattering models based on the statistical roughness
characteristics of volcaniclastic terranes of different ages.  These models
will be tested against the multi-wavelength, quad-polarized radar signatures of
the volcanic terranes at Ruiz volcano (eruptions in 1986, 1945, 1595),
Do&ntilde;a Juana (1897), Guagua Pichincha (1660), Cotopaxi (1877), and
Tungurahua (1916).<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Greatly improve geologic knowledge of poorly mapped, frequently
cloud-covered, volcanically active arc.<p>
<p>
	b)	Discover currently unknown source structure for large, 14,000 year old
ashflow deposit in southern Ecuador.<p>
<p>
	c)	Increase understanding of a seismically unusal subduction setting.<p>
<p>
	d)	Develop an optimal interpretation of radar data for detection and mapping
of pyroclastic/lahar deposits in tropical environments.<p>
<p>
	e)	Improve understanding of distribution and character of poorly mapped
deposits at Ruiz and other explosive volcanoes in the area.<p>
<p>
	f)	Recognize prehistoric Ruiz-like deposits around other North Andean
volcanoes and hence increase awareness of volcanic hazards.<p>

Multifrequency Imaging Radar Polarimetry:  Geophysical Factors from Penetration
Phenomena<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To model, experimental]y characterize, and verify penetration phenomena in
hyperarid and vegetated regions using the SIR-C/X-SAR multiparameter radar
system and groundbased receivers.<p>
<p>
	b)	To invert measured radar backscatter as a function of frequency and
polarization in terms of geophysical parameters of the surface, subsurface and
vegetation canopy such as surface roughness, subsurface geomorphology, or tree
height and density.<p>
 <p>
	c)	To display subsurface and within-canopy features in an image format, thus
easing the interpretability of the results. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	The approach we propose is utilization of multifrequency polarimetry to
separate and characterize the radar return into surface and volume scattering
components.  Specifically, we will:<p>
<p>
	a)	Model the backscatter from hyperarid and vegetated areas in terms of the
geophysical parameters describing in particular subsurface and within-canopy
structure and composition. <p>
<p>
	b)	Collect SIR-C and supporting aircraft multifrequency polarimetric data.  <p>
<p>
	c)	Separate the measured return into surface and subsurface or within-canopy
parts based on polarimetric behavior as a function of frequency. <p>
<p>
	d)	Deploy ground receivers during the experiment to measure field strengths at
both vertical and horizontal polarizations.  These in situ measurements will
constrain and confirm our theoretical models. <p>
<p>
	e)	Invert the measured scattering characteristics in terms of the modeled
geophysical parameters. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	An increased understanding of penetration phenomena in scattering.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Identification of sources for backscatter in hyperarid subsurface imaging,
and quantitative assessment of the relative contribution of canopy top, volume,
and ground surface scattering components to the return signal from vegetation
canopies. <p>
<p>
	c)	Solutions for descriptive geophysical parameters in the supersites studied.
These results would be of great use to any investigators interpreting images
acquired over similar targets by SIR-C or any other radar system. <p>

Student Report One

<p>
<p>
<p>



April 10, 1994

<p>
Alicyn Campbell
<br>
Jonathan Woodring
<br>
Aaron Moshiashwili
<p>

    In the summers of '92 and '93, through the combined efforts of the Johns 
Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth and Earthwatch's Challenge Awards program, 
eleven students from across the country worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory assembling the crew notebook for shuttle mission STS-59, the Space 
Radar Laboratory.(SRL)  This April, three of those students are following up on 
that, working at Johnson Space Center in Houston (Mission Control) as crew 
support during the actual mission.

<p>
    This mission is the first in a series that will be wholly devoted to 
looking back at planet Earth, as opposed to looking outward at other planets 
and areas. The SRL is being carried by the Space Shuttle Endeavor and consists 
of three different instruments created to image and monitor the state of planet 
Earth -- MAPS, SIR-C and X-SAR. MAPS, or, Mapping Air Pollution from Space, was 
created by NASA at Langley Research Center in Langley, Virginia. It will be 
recording and gauging the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the earth's 
atmosphere. 
<p>
    Also on board is SIR-C/X-SAR, the first multi-frequency, multi-polarization 
radar ever to take images of earth from space. SIR-C, the first half of this 
dual unit, was created and assembled by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, California. SIR stands for Shuttle Imaging Radar, and C designates it 
as the third such radar to have been sent into space. What distinguishes it 
from other such radars is that SIR-C utilizes two frequencies of radar, the L 
and C bands, and can collect the returns, or 'backscatter,' in up to four 
different ways, known as polarizations. Each different band and polarization 
will give dramatically different results and reveal different information about 
the area being scanned.
<p>
    X-SAR, the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar, is the other half of this dual 
unit. Unlike SIR-C, X-SAR only operates on one frequency (X band) but X-SAR 
also has the ability to record multiple polarizations (editors note:
X-SAR only collects V transmit, V Receive). X-SAR is attached to the 
SIR-C unit, but it was created by a coalition of the Italian space agency, ASI, 
and DARA, the German space agency.
<p>
    The radar draws from the shuttle's power source and can see through the 
clouds, (and just about any other kind of weather disturbance) and can operate 
during day or night. Together they make a multifrequency radar capable of 
imaging the earth more precisely and effectively than ever before. In fact, the 
total amount of data to be recorded on this mission is estimated to be about 32 
terabits, or a stack of encyclopediae twenty thousand volumes high.

<p>
    As of today, the Shuttle mission seems to be going along quite smoothly. X-
SAR had a few problems when it started up, but they were easily corrected and 
the radar is now working as expected. The first SIR-C images have been released 
and already are providing new insight into the state of the earth. For example, 
one of the images released, of Raco Michigan already displays differences from 
previous AIRSAR data.(AIRSAR is Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar -- a less 
powerful unit built along the same lines and mounted on an aircraft used by 
NASA) The Raco images will be used not only for in-depth study of the area's 
ecology, but for the radar's calibration as well as to hopefully develop new 
algorithms to help us further understand the massive amounts of data the SRL is 
giving us.

                Student Report : Day Two
<p>

    As of today, the mission is continuing smoothly. We've gotten some 
incredible footage, both radar and video, beamed down to us from Endeavor. We 
found out that our first report actually made it to the site that it was 
intended for on the Net, and we got an incredible tour of Mission Control. One 
thing that I thought deserved passing along -- in the control room, there is 
one plaque on the wall for each shuttle mission that has gone up. After each 
mission is over, the member of the flight team who made the most important 
mission-critical decision gets the honor of placing the plaque on the wall. 
During one mission, for example, a snap judgment call on the part of the 
booster specialist prevented the mission from having to abort from the air, an 
extremely hazardous operation. Instead, they got the shuttle into orbit, 
corrected the problem, and the mission was a success. Guess who put up that 
plaque? 
<p>
    Tonight, Alicyn is going to experience the highlight of the mission, at 
least for the students -- starting tonight with her, continuing two nights from 
now with Jon, and two days after that with Aaron, we are all going to get a 
chance to actually talk on the ground-air loop with the astronauts.
<p>
    Speaking of the loops, let me describe a little about the communication 
system that they use here at JSC during the mission. We're working in a room 
called the EOL, or Earth Observations Lab, and over in one of the corners there 
is a touch-screen monitor and a headset. On the monitor are about 18 different 
little "buttons," and each of them represents a communications "loop". At any 
time, we can monitor as many loops as we like, listening for anyone trying to 
call us or just trying to get the most up to date reports on each section's 
work. If we hear, for example, "Earth Obs, this is POCC COMM on Data PC." we 
know that POCC COMM (The Payload Communications officer, one of only two 
positions allowed to speak with the astronauts) wants to talk with us. So we 
push the Data PC loop button once, and change it from "monitor" to "talk." Then 
we can talk into the headset and communicate with POCC COMM, or MAPS Science, 
or any of the other stations. Some of our loops are monitor-only; AG1, the Air-
Ground loop to the astronauts, for example, is for POCC COMM and CAPCOM alone. 
(CAPCOM is the other position that can talk to the crew.) Because of the loops, 
a huge room like Mission Control is almost so quiet that you can hear a pin 
drop -- if you need to talk, you talk to that one person across the headset 
instead of shouting across the room. There are no ringing phones, and we can 
pay attention to several different things at the same time, as well as catching 
the transmissions between the astronauts and Mission Control.
<p>
    So Alicyn will be the first of the students to talk to the astronauts, and 
one of the very few people in the world to be so privileged during a mission. 
We have already been extensively briefed for this -- mission control is VERY 
serious about what gets said over that voice loop. Before she talks tonight, 
Alicyn will go through another briefing, and has to submit what she's going to 
say at least two hours in advance of the actual talk. It's a little extreme, 
yes, but the astronauts spend pretty much every waking minute working on 
getting all the data they possibly can, so taking even five minutes out is a 
significant demand. I don't know about you, but we don't think that this is 
terribly onerous; they're giving us an incredible chance, and I think that any 
of us would gladly agree to all of this and much more to get a chance to get on-
line with the Shuttle. 
<p>
    So, tomorrow Alicyn will give you the report from after her talk with the 
Endeavor, and we'll once again report on what's going on here at JSC. Same Net-
time, same Net-channel ...

April 13, 1994
<p>

	Allright. It's MET 04/03:10, (Mission Elapsed Time four days three 
hours ten minutes) flight day five, and time for our third report. 
Alicyn's talk with the astronauts went famously -- in fact, everyone 
here was so impressed that we've been invited into the Mission 
Control Center, the brain of the entire place. We've seen it on TV, and 
we've even looked in from the viewing room right next door, but it's 
not the same. A little later, Alicyn will tell you what went on.
<p>
	To start out with today, I thought that we would give you all out 
in Netland some idea of where we are and what we actually do here. 
We're working in a room called EOL, the Earth Observations Lab, and 
its immediate area. In this room, there is sophisticated equipment 
for monitoring the weather of the world. For those of you who like to 
know the tech angles, (I know I do) the equipment is, from the 
ground up : 5 TVs, a VCR, a laserdisk player, a MAC IIfx with two 
monitors and more memory than I can shake a stick at, a venerable 
386sx-33, an impressive 486dx-66, a PS2/70, a 386-33 notebook 
that we are in constant connection with a naval weather database 
called NODDS with, a Silicon Graphics Indy, and, on the floor, the most 
incredible piece of equipment in the whole lab -- a Silicon Graphics 
Crimson. This is a computer designed to run hyper-powerful 
graphics applications. We use it to get satellite weather pictures, 
manipulate them, and use them to examine weather under the 
shuttle's flight path. There's also a few racks of computers that I 
have no idea about whatsoever. We've also got a light table for 
viewing photos and a thermal printer hooked up to one of the TVs. 
<p>
	But I had promised to tell you what we do here. Earth Obs is 
usually a minor support position, but STS-59 (the mission 
designation for this project) is the first step in NASA's Mission To 
Planet Earth. So Earth Obs becomes a lot more important -- we (the 
students) monitor world events to search out "targets of 
opportunity," places on the world where something is happening 
realtime that the astronauts should be aware of, either to take photos 
of or, if it's significant enough, to take radar data of. There are a 
dozen little things that we have to do every day -- keep track of 
what's going on in the mission over the NASA select TV channel; 
digging up photos from older shuttle missions to get another view of 
the areas that are being studied on this mission; we take notes at the 
daily weather briefing to send over to whoever needs it. We 
correlate data; we investigate sites. 
<p>
	There's surprisingly much to be done here, even though we're 
only in college and most of the people here have doctorates. 
Everyone here has been incredibly supportive, though. Case in point. 
Pat Jaklitch runs the lab, and has a background in about four 
seperate fields of science including computers and meteorology, and 
she seems not to mind us underfoot, so I guess we're doing 
something right. 

<p>
	Allright! Now we've got what you've been waiting for. This is 
Alicyn Campbell's report on her conversation with the crew of the 
Endeavour.

<p>
	Alicyn : As of today, I am extremely pleased to report that the 
mission is still continuing smoothly.  The phenomenal success of this 
Mission to Planet Earth has made an already exciting opportunity to 
be here at JSC even more rewarding. 
<p>
	Yesterday evening I had my discussion with the crew from the 
POCC COMM. It took place at approximately 7:30 PM, and was an 
unbelievable experience. As nervous as I was, the days (and weeks) 
of anxiety became worth it to have the chance to talk to the crew in 
space about what they were seeing in regards to supersites and a 
mission I've spent time and effort on. The supportiveness of 
everyone here at JSC, too, made the experience all the more 
impressive. The continual faith shown by JoBea and others in me and 
my ability makes experiences like this even more worthwhile. When 
I think of the opportunities which have already been made available 
to me at the age of eighteen, sometimes all of this doesn't even seem 
real. 
<p>
	The sites I have been working on for the past two summers were 
in the disciplines of ecology, hydrology, and oceanography; but as a 
biology major and environmentalist, the sites in the Amazon (namely 
Manaus) have become closest to my heart. I had the chance to 
update the crew on what I have been doing here at JSC with the 
Manaus site, and tell them about the first SIR-C image of the area. 
Additionally, I was able to inquire about what they've seen so far, 
and how they're manipulating the extensive amount of camera 
equipment on the Shuttle to take images of the sites.
<p>
	The opportunity to be at the Johnson Space Center for the 
duration of the mission is an amazing one. I've spent the past two 
summers working with JoBea Way of the Jet Propulsion Lab on a 
crew notebook, and learning about the sites to be targeted in this 
mission. To be involved in the mission and able to see the goals of 
the project come to fruition so successfully is definitely an 
extraordinary feeling. As an environmental monitoring tool, SIR-C is 
one of the most important devices we as young people will have to 
combat the damage being done to the planet we will soon inherit as 
adults. Knowledge is vital in the struggle to preserve planet earth, 
and this mission is the first of many that will contribute to providing 
that information. The Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) will have a real 
impact in shaping what we've learned, and are yet to learn about our 
changing planet, and SIR-C/X-SAR is the first step. It is an honor and 
a privilege for me to be here in Houston for STS 59, contributing my 
time and myself to the mission to planet earth.

April 14, 1994                                   Flight Day Six
<p>
Student Report Four
<p>

    The mission is still moving along according to plan. The shuttle, as 
always, has had minor problems, as is to be expected of anything that complex, 
but nothing big enough to bother the mission. In fact, the biggest problem so 
far has been bubbles in the crew's water supply.  We are continuing to locate 
target sites of opportunity, and monitor what's going on in the world. 
Yesterday, (because of Alicyn's spectacular talk with the crew) we were 
fortunate enough to get to see the Mission Control Center up close. We were 
escorted in, and were able to sit and listen in with the CAPCOM and ask 
questions. The CAPCOM is the only station besides POCC COMM where individuals 
on the ground can talk to the crew in space. While POCC COMM's are usually 
scientists from the project, CAPCOMs are astronauts. CAPCOM is a crew/ground 
relations position; CAPCOM, being astronauts themselves, know intimately what 
it's like up in the shuttle, and can better understand the needs of the 
astronauts. The CAPCOM on duty had flown twice before, and also was a CAPCOM on 
the Hubble repair mission, as well as being one of the backup astronauts for 
that mission. We were really lucky to get to go in to the Mission Control 
Center, and it was an amazing experience. We work pretty long hours, but the 
rewards are worth it by far.
<p>
    We've given you a lot of background on our mission, on what we do and why 
we've been doing it, but two things we haven't mentioned are the two most 
important people on our trip. The first is Scott Milroy. He works with CTY, the 
Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, and he coordinates the Challenge 
Awards, the program that got us all started along the road that eventually led 
us here. He's in Houston with us, as both a chaperone and as a friend. Plus, 
he's the only one old enough to rent a car.
<p>
    The other person is JoBea Way, whose name we've mentioned several times in 
the past but whose role we've never fully qualified. She's the JPL scientist 
who has been our sponsor and our mentor for the last several years. Alicyn 
started working with her three years ago, for her original Challenge Awards 
project in Alaska. Alicyn and Jon both worked with JoBea two years ago, for 
their first Challenge Awards Graduate project, for a week here at JSC and a 
week at JPL. The year after that, Aaron (as well as four others) joined them 
for six weeks at JPL, putting together one of the training notebooks that the 
crew used for this mission. JoBea is incredibly enthusiastic about everything 
she does, and especially our involvement in this project. She has been working 
up to this mission for years, and seems to be about as excited as we are about 
being here. If it wasn't for her incredible support and dedication, we would 
never have had this chance. Honestly, not enough can be said in praise of 
either Scott or Jobea, as well as Ben Holt, an oceanographer at JPL, who has 
worked very closely with us; the Durfee Foundation, a philanthropic 
organization which has funded this experience from the start; or any of the 
hundred and a half other people who have helped make this what it is.
<p>
    Yesterday JoBea participated in a press conference updating the progress of 
the ecology sites on the mission. She showed some of the SIR-C images that have 
been downloaded so far, and they looked great. She also used some of the things 
that we've put together (maps, photo mosaics, etc.). It was really exciting to 
see work we did contributing to the mission, and to see someone we know so well 
giving the press the mission status update. 
<p>
    Another exciting event will take place this evening. At approximately 5:26 
PM CDT, or Mission Elapsed Time 05/13:20, our second student/crew discussion 
will take place. This time it's Jon's turn, and everyone expects him to do 
wonderfully. For those of you who happen to get it, the cable channel NASA 
Select carries our conversations live. In tomorrow's student report we will 
have Jon's report from his discussion. 
<p>
    Meanwhile, we're putting together a videotape from all the footage that the 
Shuttle has beamed down. There's a video camera on board Endeavor, and through 
the two TDRS satellites we can (and certainly do!) receive live video of the 
Earth (and happenings on-board the shuttle) much of the time. So we're going 
through the tapes to find the best views, and assemble them into a coherent 
videotape to be sent out. If you have any interest in that kind of thing at 
all, we're going to try to make the tape available to the public -- you'll get 
more updates on that as it develops. All I can say about it is that the sunrise 
over the edge of the Earth is one of the most incredibly beautiful sights I've 
ever seen. Maybe someday I won't have to watch it from a video screen...

Student Report Five

<p>
    The first paragraph of this report is getting boring and repetitive -- 
every day all we tell you is how flawlessly the mission is going. But, then 
again, it's better that we've got nothing to say than to be constantly telling 
you about everything that's going wrong. So, let's repeat it. The mission is 
going flawlessly. In fact, things are going so well that two data takes have 
been added in -- both 'targets of opportunity' that we've talked about -- 
Bangladesh and the Mississippi River.  We're particularly happy about this 
because those are sites that we've found over the last couple of days. There's 
a big difference between working a support position, however important it is, 
and actually seeing the mission change because of data you provided. 
<p>
    Yesterday, our second crew/student discussion took place. Jon did a great 
job, and everything went well. We'll let Jon summarize his discussion and give 
his impressions later. Currently, the third talk is scheduled for tomorrow 
morning. Aaron Moshiashwili will be the one speaking to the astronauts. He'll 
bring you highlights after his discussion, but probably not until the next day -
- we're going to take the day off.
<p>
    If you have the capabilities, right next door to the directory that these 
reports are in, in the \sircxsar\images directory, are JPEG images of the SIR-C 
images that have been downloaded from the shuttle. There's a text file to go 
along with each that explains what they are, and they look spectacular. 
<p>
    Security at JSC is interesting, to say the least. I know that most people 
have never really worked at a secure installation, so this is worth reporting. 
First of all, we all have two badges. The first one is a paper badge in a 
plastic holder that clips on to clothing. This badge says that we have 
temporary access to JSC, that the badge expires on the 29th of April, and that 
we are authorized to enter buildings eight, (which contains the photo lab and 
other stuff we need to use) thirty-one (which houses EOL) and building 30. 
(where  Mission Control is located) We need to be wearing this badge at all 
times. 
<p>
    The other badge is only for Mission Control, (there are other parts of 
Building 30 that we can get into without this badge) which has a magnetic 
stripe on the back and says, in big letters, ESCORT REQUIRED. Only people who 
have been through at least 1 mission simulation are allowed freely through 
Mission Control during a mission. Security is tight during a mission. They 
close all the computers off from the Internet, and even from the other sites on 
JSC -- no chances are taken. To get into Mission Control, you have to go 
through one of three huge steel doors, with no handles on either side. Each of 
the doors has next to it a unit that includes a camera, a mirror (behind which 
I know not what) a magnetic stripe reader, a buzzer for security, and a keypad. 
Each of the badges has a number that goes with it, a number that is written 
down ONCE, memorized, and then destroyed. To get in, we need to have someone 
with full access with us; they announce our names to security, we put our 
badges in the reader, punch in our numbers, step back, and our escort does the 
same. If everyone in the group did it right, the door opens. 
<p>
    Building 31 is pretty much the same as any other research lab. If you 
didn't notice the rooms with labels like SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION DIVISION, you 
could easily think you were in any of the better colleges in the country. But 
building thirty is different. There's just something about it that says 
something serious is going on in this building. We've all noticed that even 
though we know we are cleared to be in it, we all feel like at any moment a 
security guard could come up and drag us away. It's scary, and it's exciting in 
a way -- by the same token, we're somewhere where few people ever get to see. 
And until that security guard shows up and kicks us out, we're going to enjoy 
it.
<p>
    Working in a lab with this kind of technology is incredible. The feeling of 
being informed about something (and, by informed, I mean nearly totally 
informed) is strange. If I want to know something about the weather, I can find 
it out. Normally, my knowledge of the weather is restricted to what I see 
outside. Now, if I want to know what it looks like outside in Sri Lanka, I can 
find out in five minutes. If I want to see what the cloud cover looks over 
Australia, or the sea surface temperature in the Gulf area, all it takes is for 
me to move over to another terminal and check it out. I'm told that even with 
all this, we're just looking at the surface of the world weather situation, but 
to a layman like me, every question I could conceive of asking can be answered 
right here. 
<p>
    That's another new feeling, the feeling of having the power of information 
backing you. It's frightening, but a different kind of frightening than being 
in Mission Control. It's kind of like the feeling you get looking out off a 
cliff. Remember the old adage, about the more you know, the more you realize 
how much there is that you don't know? Well, I've never been as aware of how 
much there is that I don't know as I am now. You could spend a lifetime and 
maybe understand meteorology. Another one and maybe you'd understand radar 
science. One more and be able to figure the inner workings of one or two of the 
systems on the Shuttle. And we're among people here who HAVE spent their lives 
getting that kind of knowledge. It's a spectacularly humbling experience.

<p>
    Now, on a less philosophical note, here's Jon with his report on his 
conversation with the Shuttle.
<p>
    Speaking with the astronauts was a really great experience, a once in a 
lifetime experience that not many people get to achieve, and I'm glad that I 
was one of the very few lucky people.  At first, I was very nervous and 
apprehensive about speaking with the astronauts, because everyone is listening 
in on you while you talk on A/G 1, throughout all of JSC and on NASA Select, 
and a person becomes very aware that this is not the time to make a mistake 
when so many people are watching.  Also, since this was a very special 
experience, I was afraid of making a mistake, because embarrassing myself in 
front of multitudes is one of my nightmares, but that's beside the point.  
Plus, everyone is nervous about what I might say in over A/G 1 to the 
astronauts, because speaking with the astronauts is a very sensitive area 
during a mission.  As soon as the discussion began, and Mikey (Mike Kobrick) 
helped me out with my talk, I lost my inhibition and talked with the astronauts 
like it was an every day sort of thing, nothing out of the ordinary.
<p>
    My talk was basically an Earth observations update, I made a long comment 
on how the mission was proceeding from my point of view.  I spoke with them on 
how grateful we all were for the great job the astronauts on the Endeavor were 
doing on the SRL, since this was the first mission dedicated to Earth 
observations, and something new to them about reporting on what they saw from 
space, not just commenting that "it was pretty".  I went on to mention that I 
had worked over the last two summers preparing a handbook for the astronauts 
(the reason that we're lucky enough to be attending STS-59) in the areas of the 
Raco supersite, BOREAS sites, and the oceanographic sites.  After that, I went 
on to tell the astronauts how their work and the data from the SRL was 
excellent and in the future we could extend radar science and hopefully 
understand our world better through radar science.  I continued and I got to 
get some input back from Endeavor astronaut, Linda Godwin.
<p>
    All in all it was a great experience, and it was all very normal and 
natural after I began talking to them, like it was an everyday thing to do.  
There really isn't much more I can say about the experience, as I am a person 
of few words, other than I really enjoyed it and glad I had the chance to do 
it.  I thank all the people at JSC, JPL, my fellow students, CTY, SIR-C/X-SAR, 
MAPS, everyone else, and JoBea, Mike, and Ben in particular for allowing me the 
chance to sit in on STS-59 and allowing me to speak with the astronauts.  
Thanks to everyone.

Student Report Six
<p>

	Well, we're getting close. Today's Sunday, and the Shuttle lands on Tuesday. Things 
are still going well. In fact, by Friday, the amount of data that the scientists here were 
expecting to be collected had been. A conservative estimate has to be made, because of all 
the different things that can happen, but for the people down here, it's like having an extra 
four days to take data. Aaron hasn't spoken yet -- it was rescheduled for 5:00 today. 
Tomorrow you'll get that report. 
<p>
	We had a very good time on our day off, thank you very much. We visited Houston 
and liked it less than immensely, and then visited Galveston and didn't hate it but it still 
wasn't that great. It was a day off, though, which all of us needed. All of us have jobs of 
one sort or another, but none of us are used to working ten or twelve hour shifts starting at 
seven in the morning. The work is fun, but it gets to you. 
<p>
	Although history takes no notice of such things, it's kind of exciting for a bunch of 
college freshmen to think that because of research they did, something on a Shuttle mission 
changed. Because of our reports of flooding in Bangladesh and the Mississippi River area, 
SIR-C has taken data of those areas. It's infinitesimal compared to the scope of the 
mission, but because of us, the shuttle made a maneuver. Yes, it's stupid, but I know that I 
get a thrill out of it. Our part in it was collecting data on the affected areas. We monitored 
the papers, and when we noticed the targets of opportunities, we put together reports with 
everything from the path that the radar would take to previous radar data to complete 
weather forecasts to satellite pictures. And although it won't give us immortality, it's still 
cool.
<p>
	I don't know what you think of what JSC looks like, but I know that the first time I 
walked onto JPL, it destroyed every expectation that I had. JSC is easily the size of a small 
town. It is big enough to have its own roads, and I don't mean just a glorified driveway, 
either. There are a lot of roads here, and all of them are good-sized. To walk from one side 
to another would probably take fifteen or twenty minutes. There are enough parking spaces 
to fit 5,000 JSC employees and 12,000 outside contractors, from Lockheed to Boeing. 
There are about 120 buildings, all told, and none of them are anything that could be 
described as small. The grounds are very well-kept, though. All the grass is green, and 
there's a fair-sized pond right out of Building Eight. And there's quite a lot of grass. In 
fact, there are many parks that would envy JSC's spaciousness. I think that a popular 
conception is that a place like JSC would feel sterile, but it's actually quite a nice place. 
(with the exception, of Mission Control, which is still a nice place, but really is sterile.)
<p>
	Actually, there are places on JSC (and JPL) that really ARE sterile. They're called the 
Clean Rooms, and that's just what they are. They're fabrication facilities, and the nature of 
the equipment that is being build in them is such that they have to be reduced to a level of 
sterility equaled by no other place on Earth. These are the places you think of when you 
think "NASA complex" -- enormous rooms, rooms so big that trucks can drive into them 
easily. Pure white rooms, with a bunch of scientists with face masks, white outfits, clip 
boards, and lots of delicate tools put together some of the most complex equipment ever 
assembled. 
<p>
	To get into the Clean Room where SIR-C/X-SAR was assembled, Jon and Alicyn went 
through a chamber that blew all of the dust off of their clothing and vacuumed it up, and 
another area where they had to step on stuff which removed all the dirt from their shoes. 
Inside, a stream of air is constantly blowing through the room to get rid of any free-floating 
dust. And that room was relatively dirty by Clean Room standards. It was a level 100,000 
room, which means that for every cubic (Something; I'm honestly not sure. I think meter, 
but it could just as easily be foot or yard) there are only 100,000 particles of dust. NASA 
has Clean Rooms that go all the way down to level 1 -- a single particle of dust for every 
cubic whatever. That we have the technology to do that -- to take a room and remove all 
traces of the Earth outside of it, to make it an absolutely artificial environment -- is 
incredibly impressive. I can't imagine the rooms themselves, however, being anything but 
depressing, and maybe even frightening. On the other hand, these literally ARE the rooms 
where dreams are built ... that's far from depressing. But it's still an environment entirely 
different from that which Man was meant to inhabit. Powerful stuff.
<p>
	We've been here for a week, now, and a lot has changed. While last Sunday it was 
comfortable working here nearly alone, now it feels empty  There's no-one here to answer 
questions, no odd requests for information coming in over the loop. It's a lot less hectic, 
but there's a less to do. It's different. It's the weekend. Everyone but us is home resting. 
Oh well, two days left.
<p>
	I wish that there was more to tell you. Friday we mostly did research, finding out what 
people need to know. Fun work, and important to the people who need the data, but not 
worth writing about. I guess that the report ends here -- tomorrow we'll at least have 
Aaron's report. Until then ...

Student Report Seven
<p>

	This is it, folks. Endeavor lands tomorrow, and we're going home either tomorrow or 
Wednesday. What a long, strange trip it's been ...
<p>
	Y'know, we've been writing these things for a week and a half now, and I wonder if 
anyone has been reading them. I'm going to post our E-Mail addresses at the end of this, 
so that if you get the urge -- to say hi, to ask further questions, or just to tell us that you 
read these things -- you can. 
<p>
	Yesterday was Aaron's air-ground link with Endeavor, and we'll let him speak up later. 
First, yesterday's report talked a lot about the outside of JSC, which is interesting, but kind 
of superfluous. The really incredible stuff is what's IN the buildings.
<p>
	You already know about the Clean Rooms, Mission Control, and EOL. The only other 
place that we've got personal experience with is Building Eight. Half of building eight is 
the on-site medical facility. The other half, the half we've used has video and photo labs, 
and a computer set up to print photos from laser disk. 
<p>
	I've got to diverge from my divergence for a bit to tell you about the photos. An 
average shuttle mission comes home with three to five thousand frames of photographic 
film, from cameras high enough quality that they can take detailed Earth pictures from 
orbit. These pictures are all developed, numbered, cataloged according to latitude \ 
longitude, main visible features, etc. This information is stored in a database at JSC called 
sseop.jsc.nasa.gov, which is public access. NASA also publishes laser disks which 
contain several tens of thousands of shuttle photos apiece, which makes it slightly easier to 
find, let's say, the photos from STS-42, roll 97, frame 143.
<p>
	That's the only other building that we know from personal experience. However, 
we've been told about a lot of incredible stuff, which hopefully we'll get to see once the 
shuttle has landed. There's a building which is set up to run simulations in Mission 
Control. It has the capabilities to feed data into Mission Control that exactly replicates a 
shuttle mission, and they can go through any number of "anomalies," to see how well the 
ground crew is prepared for them. Unless you have participated in a simulation, you're not 
allowed through Mission Control unescorted during a mission.
<p>
	Astronaut training goes on here, and I assume they've also got the standard battery of 
equipment that you've seen in The Right Stuff. However, I'm told that they have a full 
array of VR equipment. The American government is just about the biggest user of VR in 
the world, for just such applications like this. The equipment they use today probably saves 
them thousands of dollars per astronaut in materials used for training. 
<p>
	A slight divergence, and then we'll go to Aaron. If anyone out there in Netland is 
interested in working on a shuttle mission, this is for you. STS 68, the second SRL 
mission, is flying in August. By then, we would like to have a network of people across 
the country (or even across the world, if possible) on-line to JSC during the mission. If 
any of these people knew of anything interesting going on in their area (flooding, fires, 
anything major that could be seen from space and might make a difference to the radar) 
they'd write in to us with a report of what they knew, where they were, any and all 
information that they thought pertinent. Our information here is limited by what gets put on 
the Net or in the newspapers. If it's something like a volcano eruption or an earthquake, 
we're not likely to get any information until it's over, and while aftermath is probably 
interesting, it doesn't give us any more information about the way the world works. So, if 
you're interested in helping out a shuttle mission, write to either Aaron or Jon.
<p>
	And now, to wrap up the series, here's Aaron with what happened last night.

<p>
	STOP THE PRESSES! Before Aaron says a word, we've forgotten to thank the six 
most important people in the entire mission!

<p>
	Thank you, Shuttle Commander Sidney Gutierrez.
<p>
	Thank you, Mission Specialist Michael Clifford.
<p>
	Thank you, Pilot Kevin Chilton.
<p>
	Thank you, Mission Specialist Thomas Jones.
<p>
	Thank you, Payload Commander Linda Godwin.
<p>
	Thank you, Mission Specialist Jay Apt.
<p>

	These six are the astronauts who served aboard the Endeavour (we've been leaving out 
the u in Endeavour all week. Oops.) for STS-59, the Space Radar Laboratory. It was their 
incredible dedication and hard work that enabled this mission to go so spectacularly 
smoothly. And we almost forgot to thank them. Shame on us. Now back to our regularly 
scheduled report.

<p>
	Here we go. To start out, I was talking to Linda Godwin, the Payload Commander. It 
was kind of neat because I also talked to her once before, last summer at JPL. No particular 
amenities were exchanged; the format of our conversations with the crew are a long 
comment, then several smaller comments with space for response. I told her about how I 
worked two years ago in the field on the upper peninsula of Michigan, on one of the sites 
that they have imaged. I told her about what an incredible experience it was, getting away 
from a science class to do something like that, or like working at JSC. The feeling is 
absolutely different. Learning on the job like this is incredible. What I'm doing matters, 
and that makes all the difference in the world. If something goes wrong in a high school 
physics class, nobody cares. Here, when someone asks you to find something out and they 
need it in an hour for the shuttle flyby, you don't get a chance to do it over. And you do 
NOT fail. If you did screw up, I don't really think that anyone would care; they plan for 
that, and it happens. But that's not what happens. You do it. You do the best job possible. 
And if it involves learning some radar science, or meteorology, or computer science, well, 
them's the breaks.
<p>
	I love it.
<p>
	Anyway, once I got done with that, I noted that I had been wondering how different the 
training had been for this mission as opposed to her others, and she was nice enough to 
oblige me by telling me. Pretty much the same thing happened when I wondered what 
differences she noticed in the state of the world between yesterday and a week before that. 
All in all, it was fun and informative, and I got a real kick out of talking to the shuttle.

<p>
	OK, folks, here's where we get off. It's been fun -- we all learned a little, and nobody 
got hurt. I hope that you've enjoyed reading these things as much as we've enjoyed writing 
them. We encourage correspondence -- that's how you learn, and learning's how you 
grow. 

<p>
	Signing off,

 INTRODUCTION
</a><p>
<p>
	The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian
Space Agency (ASI).  The experiment is the next step in NASA's Spaceborne
Imaging Radar (SIR) program that began with the Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR) in 1978, and continued with SIR-A in 1981 and SIR-B in 1984. The program
will eventually lead to TOPSAT, a mission to measure topography globally, and
the Earth Observing System (EOS) SAR later in this decade.  The program also
benefits from the Magellan Mission to Venus, other international spaceborne
radar programs (e.g. ERS-1, JERS-1), and prototype aircraft sensors such as the
JPL Airborne SAR (AIRSAR).<p>
	SIR-C will provide increased capability over Seasat, SIR-A, and SIR-B by
acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths
([[lambda]]): L- band ([[lambda]] = 23.5 cm) and C-band ([[lambda]] = 5.8 cm).
These vertically- and horizontally-polarized transmitted waves will be received
on two separate channels, so that SIR-C will provide images of the magnitude of
radar backscatter for four polarization combinations: HH
(<u>H</u>orizontally-transmitted, <u>H</u>orizontally-received), VV
(<u>V</u>ertically-transmitted, <u>V</u>ertically-received), HV, and HV; and
also data on the relative phase difference between the HH, VV, VH, and HV
returns.  This allows derivation of the complete scattering matrix of a scene
on a pixel by pixel basis.  From this scattering matrix, every polarization
configuration (linear, circular or elliptical) can be generated during ground
processing.  The radar polarimetric data will yield more detailed information
about the surface geometric structure, vegetation cover, and subsurface
discontinuities than image brightness alone (e.g. Elachi et al., 1990;  Evans
et al., 1986, 1988; Durden et al., 1989; van Zyl et al., 1987; van Zyl, 1989;
Zebker and Norikane, 1987).  <p>
	Germany's imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote Sensing
Experiment (MRSE) flown aboard the Shuttle.  This multimode X-band radar was
flown on the first SPACELAB mission in 1983.  The program was continued by
development of the X-SAR, for which cooperation with Italy was initiated.
X-SAR, will operate at X-band ([[lambda]] = 3.1 cm) with VV polarization,
resulting in a three-frequency capability for the total SIR-C/X-SAR system.
Because radar backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in
size to the radar wavelength, this multifrequency capability will provide
information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not
discernable with previous single-frequency experiments.<p>
	This document describes the science investigations that will be conducted with
SIR-C/X-SAR.  Investigations centered around SIR-C/X-SAR Supersites and Backup
Supersites are described in Section IV and V; the investigations of each
principal investigator are described in Section V.  The SIR-C/X-SAR
instrumentation and overall science objectives are described in Sections II and
III respectively and provide background for the science investigation
descriptions in the later sections. <p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC2">II.
 SIR-C/X-SAR INSTRUMENTATION
</a><p>
	SIR-C will provide multifrequency, multipolarization radar data.  The SIR-C
instrument is composed of several subsystems: the antenna array, the exciter,
the receivers, the data-handling subsystem, and the ground SAR processer.  The
antenna is composed of two planar arrays, one for L-band and one for C-band
.  Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dual-polarized
microstrip antenna radiators, with each polarization port fed by a separate
corporate feed network.  The overall size of the SIR-C antenna is 12.0 x 3.7
meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels.<p>
	Unlike previous SIR missions, the SIR-C radar beam is formed from hundreds of
small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar
antenna.  By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters, the beam can
be electronically steered in the range direction +/-23deg. from the nominal
40deg. off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna.
This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence
angles.  <p>
	X-SAR will provide VV polarizaton images using a passive slotted waveguide
antenna measuring 12.0 x 0.4 meters .  This antenna will be
mechanically deployed once the shuttle has attained a stable earth orbit.
Other X-SAR components include a travelling wave tube as transmitter, an
exciter, receiver, and data handling subsystem.  A mechanical  tilt mechanism
will point the X-SAR antenna to angles between 15 and 60deg., in alignment with
the L-band and C-band beams.  <p>
	Both SIR-C and X-SAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or in
conjunction with each other.  Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow
data to be acquired on either side of the shuttle nadir track.  The width of
the ground swath varies from 15 to 90 kilometers (9 to 56 miles) depending on
the orientation of the ant enna beams and the operational mode.  Table 1
presents a summary of SIR-C/X-SAR system characteristics.<p>

 SIR-C/X-SAR SCIENCE OBJECTIVES
</a><p>
	The sensitivity of imaging radar to surface and, in some cases, subsurface
geometry, and electrical properties can provide information about land and
ocean surfaces and vegetation cover that is unique or complementary to
measurements made by sensors operating in the visible, near infrared, and
thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  SAR provides its
own illumination and can therefore produce reliable multitemporal data
independent of weather or solar illumination, through all seasons, and at any
latitude.  It should be noted that 3-dimensional features are enhanced, in
comparison with optical imaging sensors, due to the side-looking illumination
and imaging geometry.  Radar waves penetrate clouds and, under certain
conditions, vegetation canopies, ice, and dry alluvial or aeolian soil, making
it possible to explore near-surface zones that are not accessible with other
remote sensing techniques.  SIR-C/X-SAR will form a joint payload with MAPS
(Measuring Air Pollution from Space) as part of the Space Radar Laboratory
(SRL) mission.  Therefore, the SRL mission will provide measurements of both
the earth's surface and the earth's atmosphere.<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR mission extends the capability of an aircraft campaign by
providing regional scale data on a rapid temporal scale.  The mission design
also enables areas to be imaged at multiple aspect and incidence angles,
important parameters for studying many land and ocean processes.  The extensive
surface measurement campaigns will provide critical data to be used in
development of algorithms needed to produce key geophysical products for
assessing global change issues.  By having multiple flights, insights on
seasonal variations for the key science issues will also be provided.  Such
validation and algorithm development studies will be critical for developing
the EOS SAR requirements and mission design.<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team, made up of 49 team members and 3 team associates
(Table 2), was selected in 1988.  The Science Team has selected over 400 sites
(Table 3) as possible targets for the SIR-C/X-SAR radar.  Although each
SIR-C/X-SAR team member was selected to carry out a specific scientific
investigation, several central themes have emerged for the overall SIR-C/X-SAR
mission.  These research topics include the global carbon cycle; the hydrologic
cycle; paleoclimate and geologic processes; ocean circulation and air-sea
interactions; and advanced technology.  To address these research areas, the
concept of Supersites, at which data acquisition will be focused, has been
developed.<p>

<p>
<u>Explanation of Site IDs</u><p>
<u></u><p>
All SIR-C/X-SAR sites have been assigned a three character Site ID.  The first
character of the Site ID indicates the primary discipline of the investigations
for that site as follows:<p>
<p>
	C	=	Calibration<p>
	E	=	Ecology<p>
	G 	= 	Geology<p>
	H	=	Hydrology<p>
	M	=	ElectroMagnetic Theory<p>
	N	=	Oceanography<p>
	T	=	Targets of Opportunity<p>
<p>
The second character of the Site ID is used to designate if the site is a
Supersite, Backup Supersite, or Non-Supersite as follows:<p>
	<p>
	S 	=	Supersite<p>
	B	=	Backup Supersite<p>
	any other character	=	Non-Supersite<p>
<p>
The third character of the Site ID is simply used for additional
identification.<p>
<p>
<p>
IV.  SIR-C/X-SAR SUPERSITES
</a><p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team has selected nineteen supersites for intensive
coverage during the mission.  In addition, fifteen backup supersites have been
selected for added redundancy should operating parameters change during the
mission.  Interdisciplinary studies will occur at each Supersite.  Table 4
lists the Supersites and Backup Supersites and their locations 
; each Supersite and Backup Supersite is discussed in detail in
Sections III and IV, respectively.<p>
	Nominally, 50 hours of SIR-C/X-SAR data will be recorded onboard  the shuttle
during each flight.  A limited amount of these data will be transmitted to
ground receivers for near-real-time digital processing during the mission.
Supersites will drive radar parameters and look directions during the mission
and will receive priority for survey and standard product processing following
the mission.  <p>
	Supersites from which data will be collected to address the global carbon and
hydrologic cycles include tropical forests in the Amazon Basin, boreal forests
in northern Michigan, and temperate forests in North Carolina.  Supersites in
which data will be collected to address the hydrologic cycle include areas of
Brazil, Italy, and the midwestern United States.  Paleoclimate and geologic
process studies will be focused in arid North Africa, semi-arid areas in the
southwest U.S., tetonically-active areas in the south central Andes, and the
volcanically active Galapagos Islands.  Oceanography experiments will be
focused in the Gulf Stream, the East North Atlantic, and in the Southern Ocean.
Calibration ground equipment will be deployed at supersites in southern
Germany, The Netherlands, and Australia, and at other Supersites.  Pertinent
data, including the geographic locations of calibration devices at the
supersites, will be archived for use with SIR-C/X-SAR data by future
investigators. <p>

<b><u>Site Description:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The Andes Mountains of South America provide an ideal laboratory to study the
effects of  both modern and Quaternary climate changes.  The mountain belt
traverses a latitudinal transect of over 60deg. from equatorial to sub-polar
regions.  Since at least four million years ago, the glaciers and icesheets of
the Andes have expanded and contracted in response to the Earth's changing
climate.  These changes have left an indelible geomorphic signature on the
landscape that can be used to reconstruct changes in temperature and
precipitation that caused the glacial advances and retreats.  In addition, the
modern glacier movements in the Andes provide a valuable record of historic and
ongoing climate change in the region.  During the last 100 years, most glaciers
along the entire range of the Andes have shown marked retreat.<p>
	The Patagonian Lake District in Argentina and Chile is of special interest
because it includes South America's most extensive modern, as well as past,
glaciers and ice fields.  The region's glacial history is one of the most
studied in all of the Andes (e.g., Caldenius, 1932; Mercer, 1976, 1983; Morner
and Sylwan, 1989).  Throughout the Quaternary, the Patagonian ice caps and
glaciers have had the largest volume of ice in the southern hemisphere outside
of Antarctica (and only exceeded by the ice fields of southeast Alaska and the
Karakorum in the northern Hemisphere).  Previous glaciations produced a series
of extensive moraines, the earliest of which is at least 700,000 years old.
From these moraines it is possible to infer the extent and timing of the
previous glaciations and thereby reconstruct the history of climate change in
this region.<p>
	The semi-arid climate of the region resulting in sparse vegetation and slow
weathering rates make it possible to use SIR-C/X-SAR to estimate moraine
chronology from space.  Moraine sequences can be differentiated with SAR
because of the correlation of surface roughness with moraine age.  Older
moraines become smoother through time as a result of boulder weathering and
soil development; in contrast, the angular and more dense boulder distribution
of the younger moraines presents a rougher surface.  The ability of SAR to
categorize moraines based on age has been demonstrated through analysis of
airborne SAR images of the Mono Basin moraines in California.  The area was
chosen as a "proof-of-concept site" because of its similarity to the Patagonian
site with expressions of multiple glaciation and sparse vegetation.<p>
	The Mono Basin moraines are well studied with established chronologies and
have been dated by cosmogenic exposure with <sup>36</sup>Cl.  In an effort to
further constrain the timing of glaciations and provide calibration for the
radar measurements, the Cornell Andes Project collected samples from boulders
on all four of the major moraine sequences in the Patagonian Lago
Buenos Aires area.  These samples are now being dated with the <sup>36</sup>Cl
exposure dating technique.<p>
	SIR-C/X-SAR images of the moraines in the Andes will be analyzed with the
techniques established by the Cornell Andes Project to obtain ages for the
moraines.  The site will act as a moraine age "calibration site" for the Andes
enabling SAR dating technique to be extended to other Andean moraines imaged by
SIR-C/X-SAR and future SAR missions.  From this cornerstone location an
extensive glacial chronology for the Andes may be constructed from spaceborne
satellites supplying new information regarding the dynamics of past global
climate change.<p>
	The two Patagonian ice caps adjacent to the supersite (and criss-crossed by
the SIR-C/X-SAR swaths) are among the least studied of the earth's major alpine
snow and ice field due to remoteness and cloud cover, although some work has
been done (e.g. Aniya, 1988).  SIR-C/X-SAR images across the Patagonian Lake
District will provide a powerful means to determine the present-day glacier and
snowline extents, and to estimate equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) on glaciers
by differentiation of snow and ice facies.  Estimation of the modern regime,
required for comparison with Quaternary condition to infer paleotemperatures
and paleoprecipitation, will also contribute important baseline data for
measurements of future changes in this climatically sensitive region.<p>

<b><u>Site Description:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	This experiment will be conducted at the Bebedouro Irrigation Project,
located in the northern Rio S&atilde;o Francisco valley, northeast Brazil, in
the state of Pernambuco, approximately 42 km north of Petrolina
.  The irrigated area is 1750 ha; the size of individual fields varies
between 5 and 12 ha.  The regional climate is classified after K&ouml;ppen as
Bsh'w-type, with a minimum air temperature of 14deg.C and a maximum temperature
of 39deg.C,  and an average annual precipitation of 391.5 mm; the relative
humidity varies from 56.7 to 67.1% and the annual evaporation is 2106 mm (De
Faria, et al., 1982).<p>
	Agriculture plays an important economic and social role in Brazil.  One of the
major problems related to Brazilian agriculture is estimating planting areas
and their productivities.  Remote sensing techniques (Landsat-MSS, TM, and
SPOT) have been useful for performing this work.  Summer crops (December/April)
account for more than 90% of the agricultural production.  Due to the
coincidence of the summer growing season and the rainy season (precipitation
above 1200 mm at the crop-producing region in southern and southeastern
Brazil),  it is difficult to obtain useful remote sensing data at the visible
and infrared wavelengths on a regular basis.  Spaceborne microwave remote
sensing techniques are considered a potential alternative to solving this
problem.<p>
	Floodplains of major Brazilian rivers have high potential for the expansion of
Brazilian agriculture.  This is especially true in semi-arid regions in
northeastern Brazil where long drought periods cause many social and economic
problems.  According to M. Alves da Silva, et al., 1981, there are
approximately 800,000 ha of floodplains suitable for irrigation at the Rio
S&atilde;o Francisco valley (a Brazilian south-north flowing river system).  Of
these, approximately 90,000 ha are operational and 75,000 ha are being
implemented.  The Bebedouro test site includes an experimental irrigation
project which is managed by EMBRAPA/CPATSA (Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa
Agropecu&aacute;ria/Centro de Pesquisa Agropecu&aacute;ria do Tr&oacute;pico
Semi-&Aacute;rido).  According to studies performed at CPATSA (M. Alves da
Silva, et al., 1981), a major hydrologic problem related to these floodplains
is salinization due to improper irrigation practices.<p>
	Within this context, irrigation techniques that integrate hydrological data
are of great relevance.  Microwave remote sensing techniques are of special
interest to estimate surficial soil moisture, one of the fundamental components
of the hydrological cycle.  The multiparameter characteristics of the
SIR-C/X-SAR experiment, as described in the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C Science
Plan (1986) and the X-SAR Science Plan, are well suited for the experiment to
be conducted at Bebedouro. <p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Develop an algorithm to monitor the hydrological cycle over
agricultural areas based on  SAR imagery and meteorological data.<p>
<p>
		b)	Develop algorithms to classify and enhance digital SAR images.  These
algorithms would be helpful for applications with future spaceborne SAR systems
(EOS, ERS-1, RADARSAT).<p>
<p>
		c)	Verify the possibility of discriminating among cultures present at the
test site by the time of the SIR-C/X-SAR experiment and to confirm the
qualitative attenuation properties of the vegetation cover as related to the
radar parameters frequency, polarization, and angle of incidence.<p>
<p>

soil/vegetation descriptors.<p>

<p>
		e)	Soil samples (about 10 ha; 100 samples/day) from the 0-5 cm layers from
the center of the site will be acquired for soil moisture measurements
following the gravimetric method of Wang, et al, 1986.  These data will be used
to calibrate SIR-C/X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
		f)	Acquisition of other relevant agronomic parameters, such as density of
seeding, soil type (pedological maps), roughness, and estimation or measurement
of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of cultures.<p>
<p>
		g)	Acquisition of characteristic curves of the soils available at CPATSA, of
a soil-water profile (by neutron probe sampler), and of the suction potential
profile (by tensiometers) to confirm the actual characteristic curves and
estimate the representative water content of the soil (W2).<p>
<p>
		Ancillary data from airborne and spaceborne sensors will include:<p>
<p>
		a)	Surface temperature (1 km x 1 km pixel) from AVHRR/NOAA-7 and ancillary
data set to fit the two layer bare soil models (six images/day can be
registered at INPE facilities).<p>

<b></b>	The Little Washita River Watershed covers 235.6 square miles and is a
tributary of the Washita River in southwest Oklahoma  (Fig. 1).  The watershed
is in the southern part of the Great Plains of the United States.  The climate
is classified as moist and subhumid; the average annual rainfall was 29.42
inches for the 24 years of data collection by the Agricultural Research
Service.  Summers are typically long, hot, and relatively dry, and winters are
typically short, temperate, and dry but are usually very cold for a few weeks.
Much of the annual precipitation and most of the large floods occur in the
spring and fall.  A more detailed review of the climate and its variability for
this watershed and the surrounding area is presented by the Staff, Water
Quality and Watershed Research Laboratory (1983) (Allen, P. B. and Naney, J.
W., 1991).<p>
	The Little Washita River Watershed in southwest Oklahoma is unique in that
over a period of several years it has had an unusually large amount of soil and
water conservation treatment and research.  In 1936 the eastern portion of the
watershed was chosen as part of a national demonstration project for soil
erosion control.  In the late 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps did
extensive erosion control work, including terracing, drop-structure building,
gully plugging, and tree planting.  Since establishing county offices in the
1940's, the U. S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) has applied extensive soil and water conservation structures and
measures, including terraces, diversions, farm ponds, floodwater-retarding
reservoirs, gully plugging and smoothing, scrub timber removal, and land use
planning.<p>
	In 1961, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, in compliance with U. S.
Senate Document 59 (1959), began collecting hydrologic data on the Little
Washita River Watershed and other watersheds in the vicinity to determine the
downstream hydrologic impacts of the SCS floodwater-retarding reservoirs.  This
data collection process involved an intensive rain gauge network and a stream
gauging station near the watershed outlet that provided data on continuous
flow, suspended sediment transport, and, for a few years, water quality.  Data
on groundwater levels and channel geometry were also collected to determine
possible effects of the treatment program.<p>
	In 1978, this watershed was one of seven watersheds chosen across the nation
for the Model Implementation Project (MIP), which was jointly sponsored and
administrated by the USDA and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The
main objective of the MIP was to demonstrate the effects of intensive land
conservation treatments on water quality in watersheds that are larger than
about 25 square miles.<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Objectives:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Determine and compare soil moisture patterns within one or more
humid watersheds using SAR data, ground-based measurements, and hydrologic
modeling.<p>
<p>
		b)	Characterize the hydrologic regime within a catchment and identify the
runoff producing characteristics of humid zone watersheds.<p>
<p>
		c)	Use radar data as the basis for scaling up from small scale, near-point
process models to larger scale water balance models necessary to define and
quantify the land phase of GCMs.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Analyze the SIR-C/X-SAR response to soil moisture, vegetation, and
surface roughness.<p>
<p>
		b)	Combine the visible and near-infrared data with the SIR-C/X-SAR data to
improve the range and accuracy of vegetation classification.<p>
<p>
		c)	Test theoretical models for microwave propagation with SIR-C/X-SAR and
microwave radiometric measurements over rough surfaces.<p>
<p>
		d)	Evaluate a water balance model using SIR-C/X-SAR derived soil moisture
values and other ancillary data.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.	a)	WASHITA-92 is a Multisensor Airborne Campaign (MAC) for hydrology
(MACHYDRO) that was conducted at the Chickasha supersite during the period of
June 8-18, 1992.  This experiment emphasized the microwave sensors on the two
NASA aircraft; the C-130 and the DC-8.  Listed below are the instruments flown
by the two aircraft.<p>
<p>

				Laser Profiler (from the USDA)<p>
<p>
		<cite>DC-8</cite>	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) - C-, L-, and P- bands,

<p>
	b)	During WASHITA-92 a large number of field measurements were made to support
and to provide detailed hydrologic data for analysis.  Approximately sixty
people, scientists, students, and technicians took part in these ground data
collection activities.  The field data collected included both the routine
hydrology data (rainfall, runoff, met data) and special data for the
experiment, including:<p>
<p>
				Micrometerological measurements (eddy correlation, Bowen ratio, etc.)<p>
				Boundary layer profiling (radiosondes)<p>
				Land cover and vegetation mapping<p>
				Surface roughness<p>
				Profile soil and surface soil moisture (grid and transects)<p>
				Bulk density measurements<p>
				Reflectance and emissivity<p>
				Truck based L-band radar and trihedral corner reflectors<p>
				Salinity and lake water temperature<p>
				Satellite data (SPOT, ERS-1, AVHRR)<p>
	c)	The meterological conditions during the experiment enabled us to follow a
long but gradual dry-down of the soil moisture.  Previous to the first flights
(June 10), there had been 26 consecutive days of rain in Oklahoma and
conditions were extremely wet with a considerable amount of standing water.
The last rain over the watershed occurred on the morning of June 9 and good
drying conditions prevailed until after the last flight on June 18.<p>
<p>
	d)	The WASHITA-92 experiment will provide a good background to the up-coming
SIR-C/X-SAR missions.  During the mission, many of the same measurements will
be made but the emphasis will be on a few detailed measurements at selected
sites.  These will be used to verify the radar performance and to provide the
bridge between the WASHITA-92 and the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments.<p>

<b><u>Site Description:</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Death Valley is a north-south trending fault-bounded valley in the southern
Great Basin of the United States.  Elevations range from 70 m below sea level
to more than 3300 m above sea level (Telescope Peak). Climate and vegetation
vary accordingly, from subalpine pine forest at higher elevations, to arid
creosote on the piedmonts, to sparse salt-tolerant plants in the valley bottom.
Surficial process investigations are concentrating mostly on the piedmont and
valley floor. They include studies of the formation of alluvial fans through
climatic and tectonic effects, the nature and rates of weathering processes on
the fans, soil formation, and the transport of sand and dust by the wind. These
are long-term studies with the goal of better understanding the record of past
climatic changes and the effects of those changes on a sensitive environment.
This may lead to a better ability to predict future response of the land to
different potential global climate-change scenarios.<p>
 	Death Valley is a good site for development and testing of techniques for
remote lithologic mapping because of the wide range of rock types exposed in a
range of environments. The Panamint Mountains, bounding the valley on the west
and the Grapevine Mountains in the north part of the valley, are composed of a
variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock types. In addition, there
are known areas of alteration that have created economic deposits of minerals.
<p>
	As part of the secondary objectives, Death Valley has been used as a test site
for the development of radar interferometric techniques. At present, both
Seasat and TOPSAR data sets are available and ERS-1 interferometer images will
be acquired in 1993. In addition, a SPOT stereo-pair has been acquired and is
being reduced to digital topography for comparison to the interferometric data.
These data are now being used in the studies described above. Soils have
developed in Death Valley in a wide range of salinity. This makes possible
studies of the radar signature of soils that have suffered a buildup of salt- a
growing problem in marginal lands. Finally, at the north end of the valley lies
Ubehebe Crater, a series of volcanic craters (maars) created by explosion with
very little associated lava. Volcanologists can study the radar signatures of
the craters and explosive deposits. <p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Duke Forest is located immediately west- southwest of Durham, North
Carolina.  There are 3400 ha within the Duke Forest, 800 of which are old-field
loblolly pine stands.  The ages of these pine stands range from 1 to greater
than 100 years, and represent the successional stages of southern pine species.
Numerous ecological studies have been performed on test stands within the Duke
Forest, the earliest being in the 1930's.  Thus, much of the baseline
understanding of ecology of these forests already exists.	<p>
	The need to develop remote sensing techniques to monitor and study temperate
forest ecosystems is especially compelling.  The fact that such forests occupy
approximately 36 percent of the earth's forested land surface should itself
provide sufficient justification for such development.  Add to this the fact
these forests produce over 75 percent of the forest products (timber and fiber)
used by human society, and the social and economic justification for
understanding their status and dynamics on a regional and global scale becomes
clear.<p>
	In addition, temperate forests are especially important in studies of trace
gas fluxes from the earth's surface.  Most temperate forests have been
disturbed to a lesser or greater extent over the past two centuries, and are in
various stages of succession.  This fact greatly affects their carbon
source-sink relationships, and may contribute greatly to fluxes in carbon
dioxide.  Recent studies (e.g. Tans, et al., 1990) indicate that an
understanding of the carbon dynamics of temperate region forests may be crucial
to balancing the earth's carbon budget.<p>
	Radar remote sensing studies at the Duke Forest began in earnest in 1989, when
a comprehensive data set was collected by the NADC/ERIM and the NASA/JPL
airborne SARs as part of a three-year study funded by NASA Headquarters.  In
addition, ground-truth has been collected for some 100 different forest stands
to support analysis of the SAR data.  Analysis of these data sets is just being
completed, and the results are in the process of being published.<p>
	The Duke Forest is also a test site being imaged by the ERS-1 SAR, as part of
the ESA-sanctioned ERS-1 Forestry Experiment, and JERS-1 SAR, as part of a
NASDA-sanctioned JERS-1 Validation Experiment.  As part of these studies, a
corner reflector array (6 trihedral reflectors) has been deployed in and around
Duke Forest, and test sites specifically designed for these experiments are
being established.  These test sites will be monitored throughout 1992 and
1993.  The results of these two research activities will aid in refining the
experimental design for the SIR-C/X-SAR Duke Forest Experiment.<p>
<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The focus of the experiments being conducted at the Duke Forest, North
Carolina site is to refine our understanding of microwave scattering from
forested terrains, and to develop algorithms to predict aboveground biomass of
coniferous forests utilizing spaceborne SAR data.<p>
	The Davis and Kasischke studies focus on development of techniques to utilize
SAR data in nutrient cycling models for temperate forests in the southeastern
U.S.  The Kasischke study is focusing on upland forests.  These ecosystems
process studies will be aided by the theoretical modeling studies of forest
structure and biomass being performed in the Davis study.  Duke Forest, in the
Piedmont region of North Carolina, will also support investigations by
Kasischke in his research being conducted as part of the EOS SAR Facility
Instrument Team.<p>
<p>
	Specifically, the following objectives will be addressed:<p>
<p>
I.		a)	Validate a radar tree scattering model using scatterometer and SAR data
collected over old-field loblolly pine stands. <p>
<p>
		b)	Determine what short-term physiological changes within loblolly pine
forests result in significant changes in radar backscatter signature. <p>
<p>
		c)	Develop a model that predicts the total aboveground biomass as a function
of multifrequency, multipolarization radar signature. <p>
<p>
		d)	Evaluate utility of biomass estimation algorithm utilizing SIR-C/X-SAR

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The supersite is defined by coordinates 45deg. to 54deg. north and
10deg. to 20deg. west, lying west of the British Isles and the Bay of Biscay
and including a section of the European continental shelf break.<p>
	The site has been selected to be readily accessible from the European coast
and to combine good wave statistics with a useful imaging geometry from
ascending and descending SIR-C/X-SAR passes.  From studies with the SEASAT
radar altimeter and from long-term weather station data, the region has been
shown to have a high probability of significant wave heights in excess of two
meters.  Although more northern sites have even more reliable waves, at
latitudes above 54deg., we rapidly lose the scientific benefit of swaths
acquired on successive ascending and descending orbits crossing at large
angles.  At latitudes below 45deg., wave statistics become less dependable for
a relatively short duration Shuttle mission.  The supersite is also within
reception range of European ground stations for "Image Mode" data fro the ERS-1
C-band SAR.  This will offer a chance to obtain imagery at very much higher
range-to-velocity ratios than are possible with SIR-C.<p>
	A successful wave imaging experiment was conducted close to the chosen site as
part of the SIR-B mission in 1984.  As with that experiment, the <i>in situ</i>
data collection will be mobile and will use ship-deployed instrumentation at
the positions of SIR-C/X-SAR crossing swaths which will move from day to day
during the mission.  The selection of experiment sites coincident with pairs of
crossing swaths will allow the relatively rapid re-imaging of similar
wavefields from different radar illumination directions.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	Improve our understanding of ocean-wave imaging by synthetic-aperture
radar (SAR).<p>
<p>
		b)	Test the assumptions of backscattering theory with regard to short-wave
properties.<p>
<p>
		c)	Develop new techniques for retrieving ocean-wave spectra from
multi-parameter SAR.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Determine the relative contributions from proposed mechanisms for the
imaging of ocean surface waves by SARs.<p>
<p>
		b)	Establish the dependence upon geometry, radar frequency, ocean wave
height, and wind speed and direction of the loss of azimuth resolution
associated with SAR wave imaging.<p>
<p>
		c)	Select a set of SAR parameters (geometry, frequency, polarization) that
maximizes the fidelity of SAR derived, two-dimensional ocean wave spectra in
the context of azimuth resolution limits.<p>
<p>
III.		a)	Apply a forecast and hindcast wave prediction model to the wavefields
in the North Atlantic from the measured wind history during the SIR-C/X-SAR
overflight.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The core of the experiment in the East-North Atlantic will be mobile, based
around ship-deployed wave and meteorological instrumentation, which will
include directional wave buoys.  The ship will travel to sites of crossing
swaths on successive days at which rapid re-imaging of similar wavefields from
different radar look directions will take place.  Supporting wave data will
come from hindcast modeling.<p>

<b><u>Crew Observations</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
1)	Crew Journal: Locate and sketch internal waves.  Document ocean state and
weather conditions at the site.<p>
<p>
2)	Cameras: Linhoff and Hasselblad will be used to photograph internal waves;
low angle sun glint images are requested.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Coverage Requirements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The minimum requirements for the East-North Atlantic supersite are four (4)
crossing tracks.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Anticipated Results</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	An accurate empirical model of the dependence of wave-imaging transfer
function on radar frequency, polarization, and incidence angle.<p>
<p>
		b)	A greater understanding of the roles of short-wave straining and of
scatterer motions in providing mechanisms for imaging long waves.<p>
<p>
		c)	An improved knowledge of conditions under which non-linear imaging limits
the wave information recoverable from SAR data.<p>
<p>
		d)	Optimum procedures for recovering wave information and recommendations for
SAR-system parameters for future missions.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Determination of a composite SAR wave imaging model including the
effects of all relevant imaging mechanisms.<p>
<p>
		b)	Determination of whether azimuth resolution degradation is alleviated at
higher radar frequencies than L-band.<p>
<p>
		c)	Recommendations for SAR geometry, frequency, and polarization to maximize
the fidelity of SAR derived wave spectra and alleviate the loss of azimuth
resolution associated with high sea states.<p>
III.		a)	Determination of the accuracy of the SAR imaging theory for three
frequencies through comparison of the measured and predicted ocean wave
spectra.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Flevoland test site is in a polder of 30 by 60 km located in the
center of the Netherlands; the polder was reclaimed from a former sea in 1968.
The topography is almost perfectly flat, and the general altitude is three
meters below sea level.  Because of its short history, the landscape of the
polder is quite simple, which is an advantage in remote sensing images
interpretation.  It mainly shows straight roads, farm houses, agricultural
fields, forest areas, and only a few urban areas.  The forest areas consist of
young deciduous trees planted in a regular row pattern.  The agricultural
fields are cultivated by private as well as state farms.  The fields cultivated
by state farmers are large compared to fields cultivated by private farmers.
The state farms are meant to prepare the "naked sea bottom" for full
agricultural use by cultivating them on a non-commercial basis.  After this
initial phase, the fields will be given to private farmers.  By 1996, all
fields now owned by the state farms will be divided among private farmers,
implying smaller agricultural fields.<p>
	The areas of main interest are found in the southern part of the polder.  They
include an agricultural area and a forested area, each measuring approximately
10 by 10 km.  The agricultural area is centered around the coordinates
52.33deg. N and 5.45deg. E and mainly contains fields cultivated by state
farmers.  The forested area is centered around the coordinates 52.31deg. N and
5.49deg. E.<p>
	To compare the results from this typical young forest ("Horsterwold") with an
older forest , a second forest site ("Speulderbos") has been chosen on
neighboring "old" land.  Speulderbos  is located on an ice-pushed ridge with an
altitude varying from 40 to 55 m above sea level.  It is centered around the
coordinates 52.16deg. N and 5.67deg. E and contains both deciduous and
coniferous trees.  The ages of the deciduous trees are up to 150 years old.<p>
	The test site has been used extensively since 1984 for various remote sensing
experiments and was a part of the SIR-B experiment.  More recently, it was used
in the Maestro 1989 and the MAC Europe 1991 campaigns, during which it was
monitored several times by the NASA/JPL SAR.  Three high precision C-band
transponders owned by ESA/ESTEC are located in the Flevopolder which are used
to calibrate ERS-1 SAR data.  As a consequence, the site was (and is) imaged
quite often by the ERS-1.  For example, the site was imaged every three days in
the August-December 1991 period.  The JERS-1 imaged the site also regularly in
1993 because of the presence of some L-band transponders.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Calibration and quality assessment of the SAR data acquired.<p>
<p>
		b)	Determination of crop type classification success with multi-frequency,
polarimetric data.<p>
II.		a)	Assess the accuracy at which the SIR-C/X-SAR standard data products can
be calibrated.<p>
<p>
		b)	Study the cross-calibration between three independent multi-polarization
systems:  SIR-C, the NASA/JPL DC-8 SAR, and the University of Michigan
ground-based polarimetric scatterometer.<p>
<p>
		c)	Evaluate the calibration "stability" of the SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
<p>
		d)	Develop a cost-effective calibration plan which includes development of
inexpensive polarimetric active calibrators.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Flevoland will be used as a calibration site for the European Remote Sensing
experiment (ERS-1).  It is likely that corner reflectors deployed for ERS-1
will remain at the site for use by SIR-C/X-SAR calibration.<p>
<p>
I.		a)	Ground truth measurements of miscellaneous soil and crop parameters.<p>
<p>
		b)	Compilation of a crop type map.<p>
<p>
		c)	Deployment of corner reflectors and C- and L-band transponders.<p>
<p>
		d)	An underflight with the Dutch polarimetric C-band SAR system PHARUS will
possibly be done.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Deploy inexpensive trihedral corner reflectors to characterize
co-polarized channel imbalance in magnitude and phase over an area wider than
that covered by the active calibrators in the primary calibration area. <p>

The minimum coverage requirements for this supersite are four (4) passes,

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Much remains to be discovered about the volcanoes of the western
Galapagos Islands.  There are seven shield volcanoes in this area (Fernandina,
Ecuador, Wolf, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negra, and Azul) which collectively have
erupted more than sixty times this century.  Unlike Hawaii, these volcanoes are
infrequently studied due to their inaccessibility and delicate ecology.  In
addition, the rugged terrain, lack of water and field support make these
volcanoes difficult to map and study in the field.<p>
	Volcanoes in Galapagos are spaced 10-25 km apart, and the stress fields
between volcanoes has not influenced the formation of adjacent volcanoes to the
extent seen in Hawaiian volcanoes.  The identification of proto-rift zones may
indicate that the inside of the volcano has preferred lines of weakness that
permit easy eruption of lava.  These lines of weakness may be influenced by the
regional structure of the islands rather than the shape of the individual
volcano.  The derived radar maps may help us decide between these two models.<p>
		The northern flanks of Wolf Volcano, and most of the flanks of Alcedo
Volcano, are either covered with vegetation (we are told it's approximately 0.5
m high) or ash deposits (&lt;1 m thick).  In Landsat and SPOT data, these areas
are bland; however, we see evidence for changes in the location of rift zones
on Wolf and, from field work, buried lava flows on Alcedo have been identified
and may be visible in radar images.  Identification of rift zone location
changes would permit the long-term (1,000s to 10,000s of years) evolution of
the volcanoes to be determined for the first time.<p>
	The flanks of all the volcanoes, but particularly Fernandina, Wolf, and
Darwin, are in places very steep (approximately 30-50deg.).  Many lava flows
descend the slopes of these volcanoes and may show wide variations in lava
texture.  Such textures are usually used to indicate flow rheology and mass
eruption rate (pahoehoe is fluid lava erupted at a low mass eruption rate, a'a
is more viscous and has a high mass eruption rate).  The calderas of
Fernandina, Wolf, Darwin, and Azul volcanoes experience multiple collapse
events and produce deep (approximately 1 km) summit craters.<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Study the relative importance of rift zones versus radial
fissures in volcano evolution;<p>
<p>
		b)	Verify radar-penetration capability; if verified SIR-C/X-SAR data will
permit the regional extent of lava flows to be mapped and the temporal change
in vent locations to be identified. <p>
<p>
		c)	Mapping the spatial variability of lava flow types with respect to slope
differences will generate new insights into the flow characteristics, as well
as show where high volume eruptions occurred.<p>
<p>
		d)	Radar will permit spatter ramparts, fissures, and faults around the summit
to be mapped.  These maps will enable the structure of the summits to be
identified and correlated with areas of recent summit collapse.  In turn this
will help identify the regional structural characteristics of the volcanoes.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Evaluate the multiple capabilities of spaceborne SAR in geological and
oceanological applications in the Galapagos area.<p>
<p>
III.		a)	Developing radar models for detecting and mapping active
volcanoes.<b></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Due to the inaccessibility of the Galapagos Islands, field work is not planned
in conjunction with the SIR-C/X-SAR mission.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Crew Observations</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>1)	Crew Journal: Describe volcanic activity at the site and locate other
areas where volcanic activity is seen from orbit for future possible data
takes.  Note variations in albedo when lava flow fields are seen from different
angles.  <p>
<p>
2)	Cameras: Linhoff and Hasselblad will be used to photograph the site and
other volcanoes visible from orbit at multiple viewing angles.  A telephoto
lens used with the Hasselblad is also requested.  Low sun angle images are
needed to see shadows of subtle topographic features on the ground.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Coverage Requirements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The minimum coverage requirement for the Galapagos is three (3) passes.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Anticipated Results</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	A more complete regional view of the eruptive history will be obtained
for seven classic shield volcanoes.  This will enable the role of the tectonic
setting and spatial variations in activity to be compared using a uniform data
set for landforms physically separated by thousands of kilometers which has
never before been possible; <p>
<p>
		b)	Develop radar scattering models that enable us to take local test data and
extrapolate these observations to the regional scale  Such methods are deemed
to be particularly important as the geologic community prepares not only to
study geographically isolated terrestrial landforms using ERS-1, JERS-1, and
EOS data sets, but also to analyze planetary volcanic terrains such as those on
Venus (imaged by NASA's Magellan spacecraft).<p>
<p>
II.		a)	To update structural and hydrogeological maps by regional
reconstruction of the structural and volcano-tectonics setting and its
correlation with plate-tectonics and earthquakes epicenters.<p>
<p>
III.		a)	Greatly improve geologic knowledge of poorly mapped, frequently
cloud-covered, volcanically active arc.<p>
<p>
		b)	Develop an optimal interpretation of radar data for detection and mapping
of pyroclastic/ lahar deposits in tropical environments.<p>
<p>
		c)	Improve understanding of distribution and character of poorly mapped
deposits at the Galapagos volcanoes.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Gulf Stream Supersite is located within corners (42deg.N, 75deg.W),
(36deg.N, 65deg.W), (30deg.N, 73deg.W), with nominal center at 36deg.N,
73deg.W.  This is an ideal site because of its convenient location adjacent to
the East Coast of the U. S. and the ease of deploying buoys, ships, and
aircraft  to support high quality sea-truth and calibration for the SIR-C/X-SAR
passes in 1993-1996.  Such support includes USNS Ago ships and Naval Research
Laboratory (NRL) and NAWC/P-3 aircraft.<p>
	Gulf Stream dynamics in this area have been intensively investigated and
modeled over the years by the U. S. Navy, other government agencies (i.e.,
NOAA, NASA, EPA, NSF), and a number of academic institutions (i.e. University
of Rhode Island, Harvard University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Johns Hopkins University).  Models have reached an advanced state and can be
used in remote sensing investigations on current-wave interactions with
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), with SIR-C/X-SAR L-, C-, and X-band data, and
from other present and future spaceborne SAR systems such as ERS-1, JERS-1,
ERS-2, ALMAZ, RADARSAT, and EOS.<p>
	The Gulf Stream is a natural laboratory with a variety of oceanic features of
basic and applied research interest.  These features include: internal waves,
fronts, rips, mesoscale eddies, and others which are continuously shed by Gulf
Stream meanders.  "Slick-like" and bathymetry-related surface features are also
abundant over the continental shelf at the site.  The U. S. Navy and NRL have a
number of projects addressing scientific and applied research relating to the
Gulf Stream.  For example, the Office of Navy Research (ONR) and the NRL have a
five year ARI on High Resolution Remote Sensing ('91-'95) in the Gulf Stream
region for understanding radar imaging of submesoscale oceanic features.  The
first experiment in this program was performed in September 1991 and a second
field experiment is planned for July-September 1993.  Preliminary experiments
were conducted during 17-21 July 1990 and 2-4 October 1990.<p>
	The Department of the Interior Mineral Management Service also has a
comprehensive three-year program starting in 1992 to understand the
oceanography of Cape Hatteras out to 200 km east of the Cape.  The program
involves measurements and modeling that should provide additional sea-truth
from buoys and ships.  Hence, extensive buoy, ship, and aircraft support will
be available during the SIR-C/X-SAR mission for sea-truth and calibration.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	The general objectives of the U. S. Navy SIR-C/X-SAR program is to
provide data for verifying SAR performance models for measurement of oceanic
processes; contribute to the detailed knowledge of aircraft and satellite SAR
as a function of frequency, incidence angle, aspect angle, sampling/integration
time, other system parameters; and support existing research programs in
descriptive and physical oceanography.<p>
<p>
		b)	Specific scientific investigations to be conducted include: radar imaging
of submesoscale oceanic features, refraction of waves by variable currents, the
perturbation of ship wakes by currents and the origin of "slick-like" features.
<p>
<p>
		c)	SIR-C/X-SAR PIs from several institutions, including NRL, ONR, NSWC,
JHU/APL, NAWC, University of Southern Mississippi, and JPL, are interested in
performing scientific and applied research in Gulf Stream Supersite .  These
investigators include: G. R. Valenzuela, S. A. Mango, R. P. Mied, A. R.
Ochadlick, W. C. Keller, O. H. Shemdin, R. Beal,  F. Monaldo, D. Sheres, P. M.
Smith, R. C. Bachman, F. Herr, C. Luther, and R. Goldstein.  Others are welcome
to participate in the research as well.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>The exact plan for operations and deployment of ground/sea truth
instruments during SIR-C/X-SAR passes at Gulf Stream Supersite is dependent on
the resources and funding, the amount of which is presently not known.  In the
meantime, we can state that high quality ground/sea truth will be provided at
the Gulf Stream Supersite from at least one dedicated Navy AGOR oceanographic
ship, two Navy airplanes, and a number of National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)
buoys which are permanently deployed for the National Weather Service (NWS) off
the East Coast of the U. S.  Furthermore, the Minerals Management Service of
the U. S. Department of the Interior has a comprehensive field and modeling
program that should provide valuable data out to 200 km from the coast from
moored buoys, ARGOS drifters, and ship surveys.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Kerang region of Australia is part of the lower Loddon Valley which
merges into the southern side of the Murray Valley, located some 500 km west of
Canberra.  The terrain is remarkable for its flatness, falling gently to the
north, and is mostly divided into large agricultural fields.  The Kerang region
produces food, fiber, and fodder and serves as a valuable source of livestock.
Agriculture away from the immediate vicinity of the river channels is dependent
on irrigation.  The wetlands in the river valleys support wildlife and
recreation areas.<p>
	The Murray basin is a Cenozoic sedimentary basin with over 300 meters of
marine and lacustrine sediments.  The region around Kerang is characterized by
aeolian and lacustrine sands, the latter showing numerous prior stream courses.
There are numerous natural ground water discharge areas in the Kerang region
and irrigation has raised the water table in adjacent regions, resulting in
salinization of upper soil horizons.  The salts are derived from "ancient"
saline ground water at depth rather than from the present day Murray river.
Better irrigation practices can minimize the salinization problem but require
the ability to recognize the presence of elevated water tables at an early
stage.<p>
	Because of the flatness, the region is suitable as a primary calibration site
for SIR-C/X-SAR.  To support this effort, Australian scientists and engineers
have offered to supply, deploy, and operate calibration equipment in the Kerang
region.  In addition, other important SIR-C/X-SAR objectives of this experiment
are to determine the utility of SAR images to map surficial sediments and to
map elevated water tables and saline soils to allow for better control of the
salinity problem.<p>

structures.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>II.		a)	Assess the accuracy at which the SIR-C/X-SAR standard data

<p>
		e)	Test the hypothesis that spectral mixing analysis can be applied to
multiparameter SAR images of alluvial fans in arid and semiarid regions.<p>
<p>

scattering, specular and corner reflectors, and dielectric constant, etc..<p>
<p>
		g)	Develop and test mixing models for comparative analysis of images spanning
multiple spectral regions.<p>
<p>
V.		a)	Carry out a technical and geophysical investigation of scanning-beam,
beam-limited altimetry using SIR-C/X-SAR at vertical incidence over a
well-characterized desert test site.<p>
<p>

SAR-interferometry and SAR-stereo over the selected desert test site.<p>
<p>

processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition in arid regions.<p>
<p>
		e)	Develop and validate analysis techniques for the study and monitoring of
desert processes.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	A record of the recent history of borehole water tables, soil moisture
contents, chemical composition, field determined dielectric properties, and
visible, near, and mid-IR signatures is currently being acquired.  At the time
of the overpasses, surveys will be made of the following parameters:<p>
<p>
	*	soil moisture/chemical composition/dielectric properties;<p>
	*	water tables and recharge rates in boreholes;	<p>
	*	ground and air temperatures;<p>
	*	soil resitivities; and<p>
	*	vegetation cover and vigor<p>
<p>
		b)	As near as possible to the mission, it is planned to acquire coincident
GEOSCAN imagery (including the near and mid-infrared) and Landsat Thematic

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>The Amazon and its floodplain is the world's largest river system,
draining 37% of South America and discharging about 20% of the freshwater
reaching the world's oceans.  Bordering the middle reach of the river is a very
large floodplain with thousands of lakes - a freshwater habitat with
exceptional biological diversity and increasing economic importance.  The
dominant seasonal pattern in the central Amazon basin is a ten-meter rise and
fall of river level.  As the waters rise, a mosaic of flooded forests, floating
grasses, and open water forms on the floodplain, which functions as a capacitor
and reaction vessel for the energy and nutrient fluxes that sustain its
fertility.  Recent attempts to model the carbon biogeochemistry of large
tropical rivers have shown that the fluxes between the floodplain and river are
likely to be significant.  The mosaic of flooded forest, lakes, and floating
macrophytes in the central Amazon floodplain makes a significant contribution
to tropospheric methane.  The fishery potential of large rive4rs is closely
tied to the area of floodplain and the magnitude and duration of inundation.
The majority of fishes harvested in the Amazon basin obtain nutrition in
flooded forests or from organic matter derived from floodplain phytoplankton.<p>
	Manaus lies at the confluence of the Solim&otilde;es and Negro rivers, which
combine to form the Amazon River.  The Solim&otilde;es River is rich in
dissolved nutrients and suspended sediments and has extensive, fertile
floodplains.  A hydrologically and geomorphologically defined floodplain reach
is located about 150 km west of Manaus; the largest lake in the reach is called
Cabaliana, hence this section is referred to as the Cabliana floodplain.  The
Negro River is nutrient-poor and contains high concentrations of dissolved
organic carbon, hence it is called a black water river.  About 100 km from
Manaus, a large, forested archipelago (Anavilhanas) bagins and extends another
100 km  upriver.  <p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	Develop a procedure for recovering the presence, absence, and patchy
presence of water and its spatial distribution under diverse types of
vegetation canopies.<p>
<p>
		b)	Modify, extend, and verify the Santa Barbara vegetation radar model for
different floodplain vegetation types and densities.<p>
<p>
		c)	Couple the above modeling and discrimination procedures for floodwater
detection and delineation for input to conceptual flood stage/flood area
hydrologic models.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Study the impact of tropical forest fragmentation on the populations of
endangered and threatened species of certain mammals, butterflies, birds, and
plants in these habitats.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The test site at Montespertoli is representative of the Thyrrenian
slope of Apennines.  Bedrock in the area is comprised of Pliocene marine and
lacustrine sediments and is intensively affected by erosion and mass movements.
More than half the site area is hilly (average height of about 250 m), with
agricultural fields and little urbanization.  In the past 20 years, the
hillsides have been extensively altered to make vineyards accessible to
mechanized farm equipment that requires slope uniformity.  The northern part of
the area is characterized by the flat alluvial wetlands of the Arno River,
agricultural fields (colza, corn, sunflower, sugarbeet, and reed), and
urbanization.  The average field dimensions are about 4-5 ha.  Hillsides in the
southern part of the area is occupied by croplands (mostly vineyards,
oliveyards, wheat, and grass) and woodlands.   The average annual rainfall is
904 mm, and the average air temperature is 15deg.C.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Evaluate SAR potential in the study of soil erosion problems.<p>
<p>
		b)	Investigate the contributions of SAR images in reconstructing different
stages of transport and redeposition of material on watershed slopes, using

(moisture content, roughness, vegetation cover, etc.) that can be extracted
from radar backscattering.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Evaluate the usefulness of radar-derived parameters in surface
hydrology.<p>

below will be measured in the two sub-areas of the test site chosen for
detailed experiments (Pesa Virginio).<p>
<p>
		<u>Soil</u><p>
		*	soil moisture content (gravimetric and volumetric) at different depths
(5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 cm) using a hand augers and in different parts of each
field;<p>
		*	dielectric constant of soils using dielectric probes at different
frequencies;<p>

		*	crop classification (crop type, variety);<p>
		*	sowing date, phenological stage of plants, crop conditions, % weed cover;<p>
		*	height and density of plants;<p>
		*	number and dimension (length and width) of leaves, diameter of stems;<p>
		*	leaf area index (m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>); and<p>
		*	plant water content (computed as the difference between fresh and dry
weight; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of different plant constituents (leaves, stems, ears,
etc.).<p>
<p>
		b)	Selected parameters (soil moisture, crop classification, phenological
stage, plant height and width) will be measured over the whole area.  In
addition, sediment transport will be measured at a station on the Virginio
stream, along with stream and rainfall measurements.  Texture, as well as other
soil characteristics have already been determined.  A DTM has been prepared for
some areas of Pesa and Virginio basins (Cerbaia and Lucardo zones).  Some
meterological data (air temperature and humidity, rainfall) are available from
three meterological stations in the area.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	The proposal is based on comparison between radar observation and well
documented ground truth within a watershed.<p>
<p>
		b)	The radar data will be compared to ground data using existing surface/wave

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>The SIR-C/X-SAR supersite at Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, near Munich, is
centered at the Oberpfaffenhofen DLR area (48.09deg. latitude, 11.29deg.
longitude).  DLR has good communication facilities, numerous processors,
laboratories, and the technical/technological infrastructure to support
sophisticated calibration experiments in the area.  Therefore, a couple of
years ago, we selected this area as a calibration test site.  Additionally, due
to site characteristics such as agricultural fields, grassland, forests,
cities, and lakes, scientists from other institutions will use this test site
for land use experiments.  Land use studies are predominantly focused on
agricultural, forest, and hydrological investigations.<p>
To meet mission conditions for SIR-C/X-SAR, ERS-1, JERS-1, and PRIRODA, the
test site area will be extended up to about 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>.<p>
	In August 1989, the first DC-8/E-SAR airborne SAR campaign took place at the
Oberpfaffenhofen test site.  For calibration purposes, forty-two trihedral and
four dihedral corner reflectors, one C-band ARC and one C-band receiver
prototype were deployed within the SAR swaths.  Both SAR systems were operated
at three different incidence angles (30deg., 45deg., 55deg.), requiring
realignment of all the calibration devices after each flight path.
Additionally, ground truth measurements were conducted during the SAR campaign.
Our calibration analyses covered all the main measurement objectives including
absolute, polarimetric, cross-track, and cross-sensor calibration.  Another
team is correcting for geometrical distortions to obtain geocoded SAR images.
<p>
	Calibration activities continued during the second DC-8/E-SAR campaign (July
1991) at this site.  In addition, a first attempt was made at determining the
cross-track inflight antenna pattern.  For this purpose, eighteen C-band
receivers and nine C-band ARCs with receiving paths were located across track
within the -10 dB points covering a distance of about 35 km.  A GPS receiver
was used to survey the ground receivers and to synchronize their internal
clocks.  The procedure applied to the receiver data was successful in obtaining
the desired cross-track inflight antenna pattern.  Antenna squint angle, as
well as misalignment between A and V patterns and pulse shapes, could also be
determined by this method.  During this campaign, ground truth measurements
included documenting plant geometry, moisture content, biomass, and forest
stand determination.<p>
	For spaceborne SAR missions like SIR-C/X-SAR, X-band and L-band receivers and
ARCs will be deployed.  This equipment  includes twenty receivers and five ARCs
for each frequency band.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Determine error sources and their relative contributions to the
absolute calibration accuracy of the overall system.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Extract all possible information from shuttle-borne radar images for
areas with forest stands.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>III.		a)	Assess the accuracy at which the SIR-C/X-SAR standard data
products can be calibrated;<p>
<p>
		b)	Study the cross-calibration between three independent multi-polarization
systems:  SIR-C, the NASA/JPL DC-8 SAR, and the University of Michigan
ground-based polarimetric scatterometer;<p>
<p>
		c)	Evaluate the calibration "stability" of the SIR-C/X-SAR; <p>
<p>
		d)	Develop a cost-effective calibration plan which includes the development
of inexpensive polarimetric active calibrators.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	A series of five different experiments covering internal and external
procedures are planned.  Oberpfaffenhofen and its surrounding area will serve
as a master test site.  The five experiments are: 1)  Internal calibration; 2)
Measurement of operational SAR antenna pattern; 3) Absolute calibration of SAR
image data; 4) Mutual radiative coupling of clutter surrounded calibration
targets; and 5) Attenuation of microwaves caused by woodlands.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>II.		a)	Classification results will be based mainly on SAR information,
however, non-satellite data (air photos, soil maps, forest maps, and ground
truth) will be used as reference data and to verify the results.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>III.		a)	Calibrate all the calibrators at standard ranges prior
to deployment.<p>
<p>
		b)	Use polarimetric active radar calibrators to estimate end-to-end
polarization distortion of the SIR-C system.  Use the estimated distortion
parameters to extract a "best estimate" of the polarization scattering matrix
of other targets on the ground.<p>
<p>
		c)	Deploy inexpensive trihedral corner reflectors to characterize
co-polarized channel imbalance in magnitude and phase over an area wider than
that covered by the active calibrators in the primary calibration area.<p>
<p>
		d)	Use multi-polarization ground receivers to record the system transmit
azimuth pattern at several elevation cuts and to estimate the transmit
polarization distortion.<p>
<p>
		e)	Use calibrated multi-polarization ground scatterometers to provide <i>in
situ </i>data over extended targets and compare them with SIR-C/X-SAR data of
the same targets.<p>
<p>
		f)	Evolve a cost-effective calibration strategy by comparing the
"calibrated'' results obtained utilizing different calibration philosophies.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The &#205;tztal test site is located in the Central Alps of Tyrol,
Austria, north of the main east-west ridge of the divide between the rivers Inn
and Danube, which drain to the Black Sea, and the river Etsch, which drains to
the Mediterranean Sea.  The mountains of upper &#205;tztal are composed of
paragneisses with subordinate amphibolites and orthogneiss.  The summits of the
main peaks reach elevations of 3500 to 3768 meters above sea level.  About 25%
of the test site is covered by glaciers; the largest glacier is Gepatschferner
which covers 17 km<sup>2</sup>.   The firn areas of the large glaciers are
located on plateaus above 2900 meters.  These relatively level areas are
considered to be relic landforms from the Miocene Epoch.  The tongues of the
large glaciers descend from the firn fields down into narrow valleys, which
formed during the last ice age.  Cirques below mountains ridges are frequently
occupied by small cirque glaciers.  <p>
	The treeline is at about 2100 meters above sea level.  The highest perenially
occupied farm house of the Austrian Alps, "Rofenhof", is at 2010 meters above
the village of Vent.  During the summer season, the Alpine grassland, up to the
highest altitudes, is used as a grazing ground as it has been since
pre-historic times.  This is also known from the discovery of the 5000 year old
man in the ice in this area.  The ice-free areas above treeline are partly
covered by alpine grasses and dwarf shrubs, and partly by bare rocks and
glacial moraines.  Due to terrain steepness and geomorphological conditions,
many slopes are subject to erosion during the snowmelt season and during
periods of intense summer rainfall, as evidenced by severe flashfloods in
recent years.  Whether ski resorts enhance flashfloods is a matter of
controversy.<p>
	The test site's core area is the glacier region of the Venter Tal, which is
one of the most intensively studied areas for glacier research in the world.
Research in the Venter Tal include studies of glacier dynamics, glacier-climate
relations, and snow and glacier hydrology.  After dangerous outbreaks of
glacier-dammed lakes, the first scientific glacier observations were reported
in 1772 (Hoinkes, 1969).  Continuous glacier surveys were initiated in the Vent
valley in the 1890s, resulting in a valuable record of glacier-climate
interactions (Kuhn, 1980).  In addition to scientific research on glaciers and
snow cover, these phenomena are also important to water management, water power
production, and flood and avalanche protection.  Permanent equipment for snow
and glacier research includes two reseach stations at high altitudes, runoff
gauges, and meteorological stations.  The Institute of High Alpine Research of
the University of Innsbruck is in Obergurgl, a ski resort at 1900 meters, is in
the outer part of the test site.  For several decades, this institute has been
the base for extensive studies of high alpine ecology, including research on
alpine plant physiology, environmental impacts of tourism, recultivation of
erosion areas, properties of alpine and sub-alpine ecosystems, and post-glacial
climate history (Moser and Peterson, 1981; Patzelt, 1988).<p>
	The fragile ecosystems of high alpine areas call for detailed studies of the
environmental processes to assess the potential impact of climate change and of
direct effects of human activities, as well as to establish the basis for
better management of renewble and non-renewable resources.  Earth observation
from space is able to fulfill the need for improved information on ecology and
hydrology of high alpine areas all over the world (Rott, 1990).  For adequate
use of remote sensing data, we believe it is crucially important to understand
the relations between satellite measurements and physical targets properties
and to develop standard algorithms for satellite data analysis.  These goals
are best achieved in test areas where extensive field measurements are carried
out and proper validation of data analysis methods is possible.<p>
	For this reason, &#205;tztal has been chosen as a model site for applications
of multiple parameter SAR in high alpine areas, with emphasis on hydrology and
glacier applications.  Previous campaigns in the test site with airborne SAR
include the Canadian SAR-580, the AIRSAR of NASA/JPL, and the E-SAR of the
German Aerospace Research Establishment.  These campaigns were accompanied by
extensive field measurements and were able to demonstrate the usefulness of SAR
for these applications (Rott, 1984; Rott and M&auml;tzler, 1987; Rott and
Davis, 1993; Shi et al., 1991).  Drastic temporal changes in the backscattering
properties of snow and glacier areas were observed in single channel C-band SAR
data of the European ERS-1 satellite, acquired through 1992 in five-week
intervals (Rott and Nagler, 1993).  Significant advancements in the development
of inversion procedures for deriving physical properties of snow and ice from
spaceborne SAR observations and for deriving automated procedures for target
classification in complex terrain are expected from the SIR-C/X-SAR experiment
in &#205;tztal.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Using surveyed test sites in the Alps, monitor glacier
properties, map the seasonal snow cover, map geological and erosional features,

equivalence over alpine drainage basins.<p>
<p>
		b)	Estimate spectral albedo of snow cover.<p>
<p>

snow metamorphism.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	The physical properties and the back scattering signatures of the main
targets will be measured on the ground and compared with the multi-parameter
SAR signatures. <p>
<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Raco supersite is at the eastern end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
It is contained within a box defined by 46deg.40'N to 45deg.50'N latitude by
83deg.50'W to 85deg.10'W longitude; center coordinates are 46deg.15'N latitude
and 84deg.30'W longitude.  The site is located at the ecotone between the
boreal forests and northern temperate forests, a transitional zone that is
expected to be ecologically sensitive to anticipated global changes resulting
from climatic warming.  Baseline studies of vegetation communities are
essential in monitoring such changes.<p>
	The site contains most boreal forests species as well as many of the temperate
species, thus studies here serve to link studies performed well to the north
and south.  The distribution of forest communities is largely determined by a
soil-controlled resource gradient established by glacial deposits such as
moraines and outwash.  Landscape patch sizes are large; homogeneous forest
stands typically exceed 4 ha in size.  Represented communities include northern
hardwoods (sugar maple, red maple, beech, eastern hemlock, balsam fir), pines
(jack pine, red pine, white pine), conifer bogs (black spruce, white spruce,
northern white cedar, tamarack), hardwood swamps (red maple, white birch,
aspen), and extensive areas of disturbance-induced pioneer species (trembling
and bigtooth aspens).  Importantly for development of robust radar scattering
models for forests, these species represent two major branching architectures
(excurrent and decurrent tree forms) and leaf types (broadleaf and
needle-leaf).<p>
	The site is not totally forested.  Numerous large areas of prairie and
hayfields provide areas of relatively low biomass for biomass and soil moisture
studies.  These areas are scattered across the expected SIR-C/X-SAR image
swath, and also provide sites for the deployment of point calibration targets.
Arrays of trihedral reflectors and active transponders are deployed for this
purpose over a 70 km x 100 km region and use both grass-covered surfaces and
several large airfields.  The target arrays are being used by US and Canadian
teams for cross-calibration of the JPL AIRSAR, CCRS airborne SAR, ERS-1, and
SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
	The site has been imaged by the JPL AIRSAR (April and July 1990, June 1991),
the CCRS airborne SAR (June 1989, October 1991), Seasat, JERS-1, and ERS-1.
Located at the intersection of the ERS-1 ascending and descending nodes, the
site was often imaged twice per day (at 12:30 and eleven hours later at 23:30).
This multitemporal coverage provided by ERS-1 during its commissioning and
multidisciplinary phases (with 3-day and 35-day repeat intervals, respectively)
will complement the shorter, more intensive observation periods provided by
SIR-C/X-SAR; and thus provides an excellent basis for examination of seasonal
change over time scales which the shuttle-based SAR cannot match.<p>
	Over the last three years, a major investment has been made to develop the
site for SIR-C/X-SAR and ERS-1 forest studies.  The University of Michigan, in
cooperation with Michigan Technological University, the United States Forest
Service, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has established a
series of well characterized forest "training" stands as a stratified sample of
the various forest communities.  At present, 30 stands (each 4 ha) have been
inventoried using a 10% sample population for characterizing relatively static
properties such as tree height, diameter, and stem count (by specie).  By
launch date, it is anticipated that approximately 100 forest stands will be
inventoried.  Allometric equations, based upon destructive sampling of the
various species, are used to estimate aboveground biomass on a per tree basis
and then summed within a stand to yield measures of dry biomass contained
within tree trunks, branches, and foliage.  Additional measurements include:
tree architecture, leaf size and total leaf area, soil properties, and organic
litter.  Global Position System (GPS) coordinates have been obtained for the
corners and sampling grid within each forest stand.  These coordinates define
one overlay in a Geographic Information System (GIS) for a 60-km x 60-km area
which also contains overlays of digital elevation, surface geology, soils,
land-use, land-cover, transportation networks, surface hydrology, and forest
inventories.  This GIS is linked to a relational data base containing time
varying quantities for each stand such a leaf area, snow cover, soil and
vegetation water status and microwave dielectric properties, etc.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Validate a vector, radiative transfer model (MIMICS) for
estimating radar backscatter from forested terrain.  Use this model to simulate
expected SIR-C/X-SAR sensitivity to forest biophysical properties such as
aboveground standing biomass and canopy water status and to surface hydrologic
properties.<p>
<p>
		b)	Develop inversion techniques for estimation of forest biophysical and
hydrologic properties from SIR-C/X-SAR data using MIMICS simulations and
airborne SAR data.<p>
<p>
		c)	Test and evaluate the inversion techniques using SIR-C/X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Model, experimentally characterize, and verify penetration phenomena in
hyperarid and vegetated regions using the SIR-C multiparameter radar system and
ground-based receivers.<p>
<p>
		b)	Invert measured radar backscatter as a function of frequency and
polarization in terms of geophysical parameters of the surface, subsurface and
vegetation canopy such as surface roughness, subsurface geomorphology, or tree
height and density.<p>
<p>
		c)	Display subsurface and within-canopy features in an image format, thus
easing the interpretability of the results.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
III.		a)	Demonstrate the applicability of the random medium model in simulating
SIR-C Supersite imagery.<p>
<p>
		b)	Analyze and interpret SIR-C imagery for remote sensing applications.<p>
<p>
		c)	Investigate seasonal variations and atmospheric effects.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	For the thirty forest stands, the following properties are measured: <p>
			*	 stocking density, height and diameter by specie; <p>
			*	 leaf area index; <p>
			*	 soil type; <p>
			*	 litter depth and <p>
			*	 surface roughness<p>
<p>
			Where appropriate, these measurements are updated to reflect changes
resulting from interannual growth, phenologic development or disturbances.
Meterologic conditions are monitored at Sault Ste. Marie and Strongs, MI.
Additional moisture-related quantities are measured in conjunction with SAR
operations and include: (1) snow extent, depth, density, temperature, and
liquid water content; (2) soil moisture, density, and dielectric properties;
(3) moisture content and density of the litter layer and; (4) moisture and
dielectric properties of vegetation components (bark, sapwood, branches and
foliage).<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Deploy ground receivers during the experiment to measure field
strengths at both vertical and horizontal polarizations.  These in situ
measurements will constrain and confirm our theoretical models. <p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Crew Observations</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
1)	Crew Journal:  Document cloud types, presence of rain clouds, and extent of
cloud cover, clearcutting activities, presence of fires and/or smoke,  and snow
extent.<p>
<p>
2) 	Cameras: Linhoff and Hasselblad will be used to photograph the cloud cover,
forests, and vegetation at the site.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Coverage Requirements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>			</b>Minimum coverage requirements for the Raco, Michigan site are three
(3) ascending and three (3) descending at a range of incidence angles.  Both
day and night observations are highly desirable in order to evaluate effects of
daily max./min. moisture and temperature conditions on SAR data.  A launch
window of 0600 to 0900 hours is ideal.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Anticipated Results</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	Improve understanding of radar scattering by forests as demonstrated by
modifications to and validation of a vector, radiative transfer model (MIMICS)
as a robust approach for prediction of radar backscatter from a variety of
forest and tree architectures.<p>
<p>
		b)	Ascertain the dynamic range of radar backscatter from northern deciduous
and coniferous forests in response to diurnal, daily, and seasonal dynamics of
the canopy layer and the surface.<p>
<p>
		c)	Define and evaluate techniques using SAR data to retrieve estimates of
cover type, canopy structure, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and plant
water status for forested conditions.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	An increased understanding of penetration phenomena in scattering.<p>
<p>
		b)	Identification of sources for backscatter in hyperarid subsurface imaging,
and quantitative assessment of the relative contribution of canopy top, volume,
and ground surface scattering components to the return signal from vegetation
canopies.<p>

images acquired over similar targets by SIR-C/X-SAR or any other radar
system.<p>

<b></b>III.		a)	Predicted multi-frequency, multi-incident angle, fully
polarimetric supersite imagery prior to the actual SIR-C/X-SAR mission.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Safsaf area is part of a flat plain, mostly mantled by sand sheet,
that extends from south-central Egypt into northwest Sudan.  This plain is also
known as the Selima Sand Sheet or the Misaha surface.  The bounding coordinates
of the coverage required for this experiment are (approximately):<p>
<p>
	N 21deg., E 27deg.					N 25deg.15', E 32deg.15'<p>
	N 26deg., E 30deg.40'					N 24deg.30', E 33deg.25'<p>
	N 25deg.30', E 30deg.30'				N 15deg., E 26deg.30'<p>
	N 27deg.45', E 33deg.15'				N 15deg.40', E 25deg.15'<p>
	N 27deg.30', E 33deg.45'				N 20deg., E 28deg.30'<p>
<p>
	This rectangular area has one "leg" (part of one pass) extending across the
Nile and the Red Sea Hills to the coast; this extra leg covers localities for
contingency deployment of the radar reflectors.	<p>
	The Safsaf area lies along the SIR-A swath on which the penetration of dry
surficial sands by the L-band signal, and our consequent delineation of
subjacent materials and paleodrainage patterns, were first demonstrated.  More
than 100 pits were dug in the Safsaf area by hand and by backhoe in 1982, 1983,
and 1984.  This field work confirmed the shallow subsurface geologic units
defined on the SIR-A images and provided data for models to explain the radar
response of the calcareous duricrust (calcrete or caliche) in which
paleodrainage patterns were preserved.  Other sand-buried, subjacent materials
whose radar responses can be studied are several types of bedrock, including a
metamorphic core complex, limestone, sandstone, and a wide range of sediments.
In terms of its radar characteristics, Safsaf is the best-known area in the
hyperarid core of the Sahara.  It is the classic locality in which to test the
radar responses to be recorded by the SIR-C/X-SAR sensors.<p>
	Additional science in the Safsaf area include penetration studies to quantify
the depth to which radar sensors can image subsurface features.  Since SIR-A
images have already illustrated sand-buried targets in the region, Safsaf is a
good candidate for additional investigations by SIR-C/X-SAR.  During
SIR-C/X-SAR, ground field equipment will be deployed as part of a quantitative
experiment to characterize the penetration depth.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Determine the optimum SAR sensor configuration for detection of
desert duricrust and to use this understanding to reconstruct the paleoclimatic
history of two large desert regions in Africa.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The Sahara, an area the size of the USA, became desert about 2 Ma, but
prior to that was apparently well-laced with major drainage networks.  With
increasing dominance of the wind, the sands in the channels and floodplains of
the rivers were reworked into thin sheets and scattered dunefields.  These
widespread aeolian deposits masked the Tertiary continental history of the
region and hid many of the relict river systems from view until the advent of
SIR-A.<p>
	Several targets in the Sahara have been selected as sites for the SIR-C/X-SAR
mission.<p>
<p>
<u>Eastern Sahara:  Wadi Howar to Nile Valley and Gilf Kebir</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Location</u>:  This area is adjacent to the Safsaf Calibration Supersite.
It covers areas crucial for mapping paleodrainages between the Nile and Chad
Basins.  It is an irregularly shaped area whose corner coordinates are:<p>
	N 19deg.30', E 21deg.					N 20deg., E 28deg.30'<p>
	N 25deg., E 25deg.20'					N 22deg., E 30'<p>
	N 21deg., E 27deg.					N 14deg.30', E 24deg.30'<p>
	N 15deg.15', E 23deg.10'				N 17deg.15', E 24deg.40'<p>
<u>Science</u>:  The radar rivers discovered on the SIR-A image swath across
Egypt and Sudan are thought to extend into the Chad Basin and then into the
Atlantic Ocean (McCauley et al., 1986 a, b).  This Trans-African Drainage
hypothesis will be tested by examination of SIR-C/X-SAR imagery for evidence of
continuation of the radar rivers' distinctive patterns in the shallow
subsurface of Libya, Chad, and Sudan.  This application of SIR-C/X-SAR for
geological exploration is extremely important because of its potential for
locating shallow groundwater in the sand-buried alluvial valleys of this
impoverished region.  Such previously unknown water resources (and other
mineral resources) have been found in the radar river valleys of southern Egypt
and also in buried river valleys discovered by random and (and expensive)
wildcat drilling efforts in Libya (McCauley et al., 1986 a).<p>
<p>
This area covers part of the probable course, now mostly obscured by windblown
sand, of Wadi Howar, a relict river that in wetter times flowed across northern
Sudan and is thought by some to be a tributary to the Nile.  The paleo-flow
direction is uncertain and controversial; Wadi Howar may be an independent,
pre-Nile, consequent stream.  SIR-C/X-SAR coverage may provide a means to
discriminate among sizes of river gravels in buried fluvial deposits, and thus
determine the "run" and the relation of Wadi Howar to the Nile River, if any.
This region is of critical interest to all Paleodrainage Project members; areas
around the Gilf Kebir Plateau and in the Nile Valley southwest of Aswan are
well known to McCauley, Breed, and Issawi and the Wadi Howar area is a
specialty of Prof. Pachur and his group in Berlin, and Maxwell.<p>
<p>
<u>Central Sahara:  Wadi Tafassasset</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Location</u>:  This area along the border of northern Niger with
southeastern Algeria includes the course of Wadi Tafassasset, one of several
relict tributary drainages that formerly flowed to the Niger River, but are now
mostly defunct and obscured by sand sheets and dunes.<p>
<p>
<u>Science</u>:  The Tafassasset area is bounded (approximately) by latitudes
20deg. and 24deg.30'N, and by longitudes 7deg.30' and 11deg.30'E (see map).
This area has been studied by French geologists, including H. Faure, using
conventional geologic field methods.  Faure's group is presently using SPOT
imagery to map the drainage patterns that are visible in certain places; other,
key areas are obscured by sand and will only be mappable from the SIR-C/X-SAR
coverage.  SIR-C/X-SAR has the potential to greatly increase our knowledge of
the evolutionary history of this part of the Central Sahara in relation to
paleoclimatic conditions, regional tectonics, and the capture and reversal of
the Niger River system.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Objectives</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>I.		a)	Major objectives are the utilization of multiple-polarization,

SPOT and high-altitude photographic data, for exploration geology.<p>
<p>
		c)	Produce a major report on the distribution of paleodrainages in the
Sahara, their relations to the basic tectonic elements of North Africa (basins
and swells), and their economic potential.<p>
<p>
III.		a)	Determine the optimum SIR sensor configuration for detection of desert
duricrust and to use this understanding to reconstruct the paleoclimatic
history of two large desert regions in Africa.<p>
<p>
IV.		a)	Model, experimentally characterize, and verify penetration phenomena in
hyperarid and vegetated regions using the SIR-C multiparameter radar system and
ground-based receivers.<p>
<p>
		b)	Invert measured radar backscatter as a function of frequency and
polarization in terms of geophysical parameters of the surface and subsurface
such as surface roughness and subsurface geomorphology.<p>
<p>
		c)	Display subsurface features in an image format, thus easing the
interpretability of the results.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>V.		a)	Demonstrate the applicability of the random medium model in
simulating SIR-C Supersite imagery.<p>
<p>
		b)	Analyze and interpret SIR-C imagery for remote sensing applications.<p>
<p>
		c)	Investigate seasonal variations and atmospheric effects.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Field Measurements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I. 		a)	Field observations will be carried out to collect ground truth data on
joint systems, fold structures, fault systems, rock types, thickness of sand
layer over paleodrainages, dune dimensions and orientation, and vegetation
density.<p>
<p>
II.		a) 	Testpits will be excavated and documented to determine the
distribution and composition of buried fluvial deposits located by their radar
signatures on SIR-C/X-SAR images, for reconstruction of paleodrainage systems
and potential aquifers.<p>

<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Crew Observations</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
1)	Crew Journal: Document dust storms and vegetation extent.  Sketch any
drainage patterns at the site.<p>
<p>
2)	Cameras: Linhoff and Hasselblad will obtain low sun angle photographs of the
desert.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><u>Coverage Requirements</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
1)	Coverage of the Eastern Sahara area requires eight short swaths, with 10%
side overlaps (total length approximately 5,000 km).  All coverage for the
Paleodrainage Experiment should be in Mode 11, with the widest possible
swath.<p>
<p>
2)	Two "boxes" are shown on the map, representing both orientations of the
potential SIR-C/X-SAR coverage.  The NW-SE, narrower but longer rectangle would
be best for tracking the course of the Tafassasset paleodrainage system from
the Djanet (Ft. Charlet) area into the sand-covered desert (Tenere du
Tafassasset and Erg of Bilma).  The corner coordinates of that box are:<p>
<p>
	N 21deg.45', E 7deg.50'			N 20deg., E 12deg.<p>
	N 22deg.45', E 9deg.20'			N 19deg., E 10deg.40'<p>
<p>
	Coverage of that box would require two short swaths, each 500 km long, with
10% overlap (again in Mode 11).<p>
<p>
<b><u>Anticipated Results</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
I.		a)	Significant new data on joint systems and fold structures, as well as
some of the major fault systems.<p>
<p>
		b)	Exploration of Pleistocene paleodrainage system with major implications
for regional hydrology.<p>
<p>
		c)	Contributions to the archaeological geology by way of ancient irrigation
channels and now buried settlements.<p>
<p>
II.		a)	Major contribution to the knowledge of the nature and scope of the
erosional events from middle to later Tertiary time, which gave rise to the
present (Quaternary) geomorphology of North Africa.<p>
<p>
		b)	A major report will be prepared with accompanying maps that we hope will
have broad scientific and economic applications (for both the public and
private sectors).<p>
<p>
III.		a)	An improved understanding of radar backscatter and penetration in
hyperarid-to-semiarid terrains that was initiated during our SIR-A/B

imaging.<p>

<b><u>Site Description</u>:</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>SIR-C/X-SAR's two experiments involving rain offer a unique challenge
to the operation of the radar during the flight.  Whereas all other experiments
can be reasonably tied to a specific area on the surface of the Earth, the rain
experiments only require that a reasonably "deep" rainstorm be in progress.
The requirement is a difficult one because weather targets are transitory in
both space and time and cannot be scheduled.  The probability of observing a
good target depends on the correlation time of the weather event, the average
frequency of events, and the number of independent looks at the target.  Since
the planning process for the Shuttle flight requires a fixed location, the rain
experiments have been chosen to concentrate on an area where longer correlation
times may exist.  Such areas associated with monsoons and tropical convective
systems near the Intertropical Convergence Zone and mid-latitude mesoscale
convective complexes, which naturally leads one to either the western or
eastern Pacific.<p>
	Given the additional necessity of being seasonally independent and other
mission planning realities, a large area in the western Pacific was chosen for
the "rain supersite".  This area has the additional advantage of containing a
weather monitoring station at  Guam and  of being relatively  low in contention
with other SIR-C/X-SAR sites.<p>

about 80 kilometers south of Winnipeg in western Canada.  This test site is
about 4 x 20 miles in size with approximately  700-800 fields contained in the
area.  It is located in the Red River Basin and is characterized by rich
farmland where a variety of crops are grown including wheat, barley, canola,
corn, sunflower, and sugar beets.  The soils were developed under tall-grass
prairie and meadow-grass on sandy to silty lacustrine and deltaic sediments
with smooth, very gently sloping topography.  Recent clay overwash from shallow
runways occurs as a surface mantle in a number of locations within the site.
Due to soil fertility, the original vegetation has largely disappeared and has
been replaced by arable agriculture and windbreaks.  Native wooded areas occur
adjacent to streams, shallow water runways, and homestead locations.<p>

	The Gran Pantanal is an extensive (ca 150,000 km<sup>2</sup>) floodplain on
the upper Paraguay River, located mostly in Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul state).
The tropical climate, marked seasonality in rainfall, and generally flat relief
create a mosaic of savanna interspersed with permanent water bodies and patches
of semi-deciduous forest, much of which is subject to inundation during part of
the year.  The inundation cycle within this huge floodplain is very complex,
since the rivers contributing to the flooding have varying seasonal flood peaks
.  A wide variety of vegetation types occur, including dense forest, woody
savanna, bush savanna, and floating meadows.<p>
<p>
The objectives of the SIR-C/X-SAR investigations at this site include:<p>
	Identification of the radar signatures of the major floodplain habitats: open
water, floating grasses, mixed floating macrophytes, flooded dicot forests of
varying stature and palm stands.<p>
	Assessment of the degree to which the presence or absence of standing water
can be detected under flooding plain vegetation, and whether water-saturated
and flooded grassland environments are distinguishable.<p>
	Estimate regional inundation as input to ongoing biogeochemical studies.<p>
	Apply models of radar backscatter to tropical floodplains.<p>

	Two experiments will be conducted at the Eastern Pacific test site.  The first
will determine the effect of precipitation on SIR-C and X-SAR measurements.
These radar data will be analyzed using radiative transfer models to provide
profiles of the attenuation coefficient (<i>a</i>).  The use of <i>a-R</i>
relationships will then be used to derive the vertical profile of the rain rate
(<i>R</i>).  Dual-frequency radar data provided by SIR-C/X-SAR will overcome
beam-filling problems and provide information on the spatial distribution of
ice and liquid water in the clouds.<p>
	The second experiment involves several proof-of-concept experiments for remote
sensing of precipitation by the SIR-C/X-SAR.  These experiments will
significantly increase the understanding of the ability of spaceborne synthetic
aperture radar to conduct global measurement and monitor precipitation.<p>

	This study will examine the small-scale velocity structure of the front
separating cold Pacific equatorial water from warmer tropical water to the
north.  This front develops as instability waves in the autumn during non-El
Ni&ntilde;o years when the North Equatorial Current is most intense.  The waves
have lengths of about 1200 km and propagate westward at about 0.5 m/s.  As
these waves are major contributors to heat and momentum fluxes in these
regions, it is important to understand the mechanisms responsible for their
growth and their effects on thermohaline structure on the equatorial current
systems.  In addition, it is important to study the processes that mix the
narrow cold filaments with the surrounding warm tropical water; these are at
present largely unknown.<p>
	SIR-C/X-SAR images will be used to map the interaction of swell and current
shear, convergence zones, and small-scale variability in surface wind stress
and to use AVHRR images of sea surface temperature to locate thermal
boundaries.  Real-time AVHRR images will be collected at the University of
Hawaii receiving station.  <p>
	SAR images using multiple frequencies are needed to locate and assess the wave
structure at the current shear zones.  Ocean-truth measurements will be
attempted using ships of opportunity during the SIR-C/X-SAR flights and include
temperature, salinity, density, and velocity.  The latitudes of the fronts can
vary between 1deg.N and 7deg.N within 130deg.W and 180deg.W longitude.
Frequent SAR sampling, both spatially and temporally, is needed to determine
front locations, frontal wavelengths, and wave propagation velocity, and to
compensate for high and low wind periods which may preclude detection of the
wave/current interaction.<p>

	The  Hawaiian test site centers on the Ka'u Desert, which extends from the
summit of Kilauea Volcano along the Southwest Rift Zone towards the ocean.
Bordered by Mauna Loa Volcano to the Northwest and the Koae Fault system to the
Southeast, the Ka'u desert contains many lava morphologies and ash deposits
that are expected on other volcanoes (Gaddis and Mouginis-Mark, 1987).<p>
	Rift zone eruptions in Hawaii produce different lava flow morphologies and
erupt at the surface at different rates compared to the summit activity (Wadge,
1981; Rowland, 1987; Rowland and Walker, 1987).  Some structural features
associated with the rift zones of Mauna Loa appear to reflect the interaction
between magma injection into the upper parts of the volcano, gravitational
slumping of the edifice, and the buttressing of the flanks by adjacent
volcanoes (Lipman, 1980).  By using SIR-C/X-SAR data to map the spatial
distribution of fractures, and the variation in flow types and ash deposits
produced along the rift zones of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes, changes in
eruption style may be related to dike propagation and the internal structure of
the volcanoes (Ryan et al., 1981; Head and Wilson, 1987).<p>

models and reconstructions of the tectonic history of the area.  This work will
test the hypotheses that:  1) Chronologies developed at a few widely separated

surface-age maps using remote sensing data;  2) These maps contain information
about the temporal and spatial distribution of climate changes that can be
related to other global climate records; and 3) The surface-age maps can be
used to date fault movements over a large area of northwestern China.<p>

of desert piedmont surfaces and landforms of different ages using laboratory,
field, and remote sensing data in a few widely separated test sites in
northwestern China where chronological control is available or can be
developed; 2) Use the spectral signatures to map the distribution and correlate
the ages of surfaces and landforms related to past climate changes; 3)
Determine the history of Quaternary climate change for the region based on the
maps and ages; 4) Determine the ages of Quaternary movements on some of the
large, active faults in northwestern China; and 5) Compare the types, rates,

and remote sensing studies since 1989.  In addition, over the past several
years extensive atmospheric monitoring activities have been supported by the
Spruce Fir Cooperative, National Acidic Deposition Project and the Mountain
Cloud Chemistry program.  NASA Headquarters-sponsored Forest Ecosystem
Dynamics-Multisensor Aircraft Campaign (FED-MAC) experiments were conducted at
the Howland site during August-September 1989, March, July, and September 1990
and June 1991.  Airborne JPL AIRSAR (C-, L-, and P-band) were acquired during
1989, 1990, and 1991.  Additional aircraft measurements, including ER-2 AVIRIS,
C-130 ASAS, and NS001 and UH-1 helicopter optical radiometers have been
acquired.  Data from aircraft and field measurements have been cataloged in a
computerized data base which is available through the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics
Project at Goddard Space Flight Center Biospheric Sciences Branch.<p>
	On or near the Howland site, there are a variety of different aged clearing,
small plantations, and larger expanses of natural forest cover.  This natural
forest is transitional boreal with major forest types of spruce-hemlock,
hemlock-mixed hardwoods and mixed hardwood.  Because of the glacial history of
the area, soil drainage classes vary from well-drained to very poorly-drained
over limited distances producing a complex mosaic of forest communities.  In
addition, significant areas of bogs and wetlands occur throughout the area.
This variety of forest ecosystem types within a localized area was the primary
factor for the selection of this site.  Another important consideration was the
excellent logistics in place to support field and aircraft activities.<p>
	Extensive forest canopy and soil characteristics for numerous forest stands
have been acquired for the site.  Sample plot measurements for 60 stands
include DBH, height, height to live crown, angle of bole, leaf area index
estimates and soil organic analysis.  A stem map was created in 1989 for a 200
x 150 meter area of spruce-hemlock forest.  Tree architecture measurements for
spruce and hemlock, including bole, branch, and needle angle distributions were
acquired.  Additional forest stand measurements are being acquired as needed.<p>

series of aircraft flights with a P-,  L-,  and C-band polarimeter (a synthetic

watersheds using SAR data, ground-based measurements, and hydrologic
modeling;<p>
2)	To use radar-derived soil moisture patterns to characterize the hydrologic

	The major goal of the proposed work is to model the spatial distribution of
snow surface energy exchange, snow metamorphism, and snow melt in alpine
drainage basins.  For hydrologic and land surface climate investigations in
alpine areas, seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are important parameters.
Over major portions of the middle and high latitudes, and at high elevations in
the tropical latitudes, snow and alpine glaciers are the largest contributors
to runoff in rivers and to ground water recharge.  Snow and ice also play
important interactive roles in the regional climates because snow has a higher
albedo than any other natural surface.  Understanding processes in the seasonal
snow cover is also important for studies of the chemical balance of alpine
drainage basins because of translocation of anions and cations within the
snowpack and possible concentrated release in the first phases of the melt
season.<p>
	The instrument site at Mammoth Mountain ski area is on the eastern slope of
the south-central Sierra Nevada at an elevation of 2930 m, approximately 50 km
northwest of Bishop, California.  A snow study plot has been maintained there
since 1978.  Year-round access to the instrument site is provided by the ski
area's gondola and lift system, and summer access by automobile is possible.
The site is an open, high altitude area characterized by high winds and dry
snow, and is typical of the Sierra Nevada's alpine region.  Wind speeds of 30
meters per second are not uncommon.  Vegetation is sparse with only a few large
trees 50 to 200 meters away.  Mean winter air temperature is approximately
-5deg.C, and mean annual maximum snow water equivalent is about 0.8 m.
Snowfall usually begins in early November, and the snowpack often persists well
into May.  The site is instrumented with complete automatic meteorological
capabilities, radiometers, a snow pillow, and snow lysimeters.  At this site,
it is possible to carry out a complete energy budget from the beginning of the
accumulation season until the end of the snow melt season.<p>

	Despite the considerable number of variables that contribute to SIR-C/X-SAR
image formation, the data can reveal system descriptors by studying the system
response to known point or extended targets within the scene.  Even if
restricted to SAR application on land, it can be stated that the only effective
calibration is one performed at the total system level, e.g. from input scene
to output image or from input spectra to output spectra.  The ultimate
justification of this study is to prove the effectiveness of calibration to
provide the end-users with consistent data-sets.<p>
	This test site in southern Italy, near Matera, was chosen because it offers
several advantages.  A new National Research Council Institute, devoted to
space activities and connected to the National Space Plan, has been completed
in this area.  In December 1987, SAR processing activities started in this
research center where a Laser Ranging Station has been fully operative since
1985.  Further advantages are:  1) the existence of detailed and current
topographic surveys for the area; 2) the proximity of powerful computing
facilities; 3) the foreseen SAR Processing Facilities that could process
SIR-C/X-SAR raw data; 4) public and private institutions in the area conducting
environmental and agricultural studies; and 5) the morphological and land cover

	Two-dimensional ocean wave spectra will be measured using a pitch and roll
buoy from a German Hydrographic Office ship located in the North Sea.  There
will also be collaboration with North Sea oil rig operators to obtain wave

	In addition to these in-situ measurements of ocean wave spectra, a third
generation wave prediction model, called the WAMODEL, will be applied to
forecast, resp. hindcast, the wavefields in the North Sea from the measured
wind history during the SIR-C overflight.  The two-dimensional wave spectra
measured by the buoys and calculated from the WAMODEL over the entire North Sea
(and Atlantic) will be compared with the X-, C- and L-band SAR image intensity
spectra of SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
		The second experiment will investigate the possibilities and limitations of
mapping sea bottom topography with SIR-C/X-SAR imagery.  Detailed knowledge of
shallow sea bottom topography is important for studying coastal zone
management, coastal erosion, environmental development, operational guidance of
shipping traffic, fisheries and offshore activities.  This work will be
conducted in collarboration with Delft Hydraulics (Netherlands) and Gordon
Keyte.  <p>
	Radar images have great potential for revealing large scale horizontal
structures including underwater banks and sand waves.  Although no accurate
depth information can be obtained from SAR imagery, it does provide a synoptic
view of a large area.  Such overviews are useful to select spatial and temporal
sampling of the region involved and are an indispensable tool for optimizing
bathymetric surveys.<p>
	There is a broad consensus that imaging of sea bottom topography is due to
modulation of surface roughness by the interaction of tidal currents and sea
bottom topography.  It is likely that radar images revealing sea bottom
topography can provide information about the dynamic behavior and evolution of
bottom structures.<p>

an improved understanding of the interactions between the boreal forest biome
and the atmosphere in order to clarify their roles in global change.<p>
	Specific objectives are:  1) Improve our understanding of the processes which
govern the exchanges of energy, water, heat, carbon, and trace gases between
boreal forest ecosystems and the atmosphere, with particular reference to those
that may be sensitive to global change; and 2) to develop and validate remote
sensing algorithms for transferring our understanding of the above processes
from local to regional scales.	 In particular, BOREAS will address three major
scientific issues:  1) the biogeochemical functioning of the boreal forest,
including controls on carbon storage and partitioning and the seasonal and
spatial variability of trace gas fluxes; 2) the sensitivity of the boreal
forest biome to changes in the physical climate system; and 3) the biophysical
feedbacks to the climate system due to ecological changes in the functioning of

Sea) and from a ship of the German Hydrographic Office in the North Sea.
Collaborate with of North Sea oil rig operators to obtain wave spectra from

	b)	A third generation wave prediction model (WAMODEL) will be applied to
forecast, respectively hindcast, the wavefields in the North Sea from the
measured wind history during the SIR-C overflight.  The WAMODEL has a
resolution of 0.5 degrees longitude and 0.25 degrees latitude.  This model
(Komen and Zambreski, 1986; Bauer et al., 1988) seems to be accurate in
predicting two-dimensional ocean wave spectra in the North Sea and will be
refined for the SIR-C mission. <p>

with the X-, C-, and L-Band SAR image intensity spectra of SIR-C. <p>
<p>
	b)	Apply SAR imaging theory (Alpers and Rufenach, 1979, Alpers et al., 1981;
Alpers, 1983; Alpers and Bruning, 1988; Alpers et al., 1986; Bruning et al.,

dry snow and possibly for wet snow.  Use co-registered digital elevation data,
derived from low-altitude aerial photographs, from SPOT stereographic coverage,
or contour maps, to correct for topographic effects in radar data.  Validate
measurements with intensive snow surveys coincident with SIR-C flights, and
with scatterometer measurements at one site.  To insure that results are not
site-specific, field and satellite investigations will be carried out in three
different mountain ranges with different climates: Sierra Nevada (California),
Swiss Alps, and Tien Shan (Xinjiang, northwest China).  We also plan to acquire
satellite data, but no field measurement s, for a test site in the Himalaya
(Tibet, southwest China).<p>
<p>

its contamination by impurities (e.g. dust or soot).  Use these parameters to
extend albedo throughout the solar spectrum.  AVIRIS data will be requested for
US. sites and Landsat data for foreign sites.<p>
<p>
	c)	Use frequencies from SIR-C/X-SAR, especially 9.6 GHz, to detect wet snow
and estimate liquid-water content, and possibly to identify dry snowpacks with
a wet surface layer and wet snowpacks with a dry surface layer.<p>

	d)	Use satellite or aircraft data, local micrometeorological data, and digital
elevation grids to derive basin-wide energy balance model of snowpack.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Evaluate the ability to continuously monitor and model processes in the
Earth's alpine snow cover, thus demonstrating the possibility of achieving an
important objective that could be supported by the Earth Observing System
(EOS).<p>

Alluvial Fan Evolution in the Western Great Basin<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Describe systematic morphologic changes with surface age in terms of
multiparameter radar backscatter for dated chronosequences on alluvial fans at
one or two sites in the western Great Basin.  Compare these changes to chemical
weathering patterns observed for the same fans using visible/near-infrared
(VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) images.<p>
<p>
	b)	Construct a depositional and weathering history for the studied alluvial
fans based on SAR, other images, and field investigations; use this to
constrain paleoclimatic interpretations for the Great Basin.  Use project as
prototype for paleoclimate study of entire Great Basin or other geomorphic
provinces, where multiparameter SAR data can be acquired regionally.<p>
<p>
	c)	Test the application of spectral mixing analysis on multiparameter SAR
images of alluvial fans in arid and semiarid regions.  Define radar endmembers
(from the spectral mixing analysis) physically, in terms of Bragg scattering,
volume scattering, specular and corner reflectors, and dielectric constant,
etc.  Develop and test mixing models for comparative analysis of images
spanning multiple spectral regions.  <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Select study site(s) in Owens Valley/Death Valley to exploit existing
geomorphic, soils, and geochronology data, for a sequence of alluvial fans
deposited during the last 0.5 Ma.<p>
<p>
	b)	Compare spectral differences in VNIR, TIR, and SIR-C SAR images in terms of
systematic chemical and morphological differences predicted by current
weathering models, given the known ages of the fan surfaces.  Make precise
measurements of integrated weathering rates for each dated surface, which can
then be analyzed jointly to construct a history of weathering rates and rate
changes for selected parameters (e.g., oxidation, hydration, clast
disintegration and aeolian silt redistribution).<p>
<p>
	c)	Interpret weathering-rate history in terms of climatic factors that promote
weathering (e.g., temperatures, precipitation and excess moisture, wind
velocity).  <p>
<p>
	d)	Collect and independently analyze VNIR, TIR, and airborne SAR images of the
study site(s) prior to the mission to test spectral mixing models applied to
radar images alone and with other images.<p>
<p>
	e)	Coregister all SIR-C/X-SAR images to digital terrain models, and jointly
analyze them using the "hierarchical" or multi-level spectral mixing model.<p>
<p>
	f) 	Separately analyze data from limited spectral regions that are affected by
one physical process (e.g., absorption by iron oxide in VNIR data, or
scattering due to surface roughness in radar wavelengths).  This will be
followed by analysis comparing and contrasting results for processes affecting
more than one spectral region (e.g., topographic texture affects VNIR data by
shading, and affects radar data by scattering).<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	New technique for "unmixing" multiparameter radar images into meaningful
components (e.g., volume-scattering surfaces or "vegetation," Bragg-scattering
surfaces, etc.).<p>
<p>
	b)	An alternative to "extended spectral signatures" for joint analysis of
disparate images spanning multiple spectral regions.<p>
<p>
	c)	Better history of bajada surface evolution than available from chemical
weathering studies alone.<p>
<p>
	d)	Improved knowledge of Pleistocene paleoclimate in the western Great
Basin.<p>
<p>
	e)	Test predictive models for climate/paleoclimate and for inferences from
paleoecological studies.<p>

<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Separate topographic maps of the forested site from L- and C-band data.
Measurement of canopy height from the difference between these data sets.  Use
ground truth data to assess the validity of two frequency interferometry for
monitoring canopy height in forested areas.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Detect changes of less than one centimeter in the surface of the fields at
the farm site.  Such changes are expected to depend mostly on the moisture
content of the fields, through either dielectric constant changes or physical
swelling of the surface induced by water.<p>
<p>
	c)	Since surface disturbances at the desert test site are not expected to
occur between successive SIR-C overflights, it is expected that phase changes
due to changes in local tropospheric water vapor may be detectable by
differential interferometry.<p>
<p>
	d)	Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of topography derived from

Relating Radar Backscatter Responses to Woody and Foliar Biomass of Pine
Forests<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Demonstrate the use of spaceborne SAR images to detect forest parameters
(biomass of different parts of the canopy). <p>
<p>
	b)	Increase the understanding of the interaction between microwaves and
vegetation canopies. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	We propose to use Landes forest, near Bordeaux, South East of France as a test
site.  Previous work in this area has established an existing dataset.
Inversion algorithms developed on the test-site will be applied to SIR-C/X-SAR
data acquired on other sites in the world including coniferous forest sites.
It is proposed to relate SIR-C/X-SAR data to vegetation parameters and to
develop an inversion algorithm as follows:<p>
<p>
	a)	Theoretical model(s) will be developed and validated by experiments
performed with airborne and laboratory systems.<p>
<p>
	b)	The output of validated theoretical model(s) will be used : <p>
<p>
		1.  to study the sensitivity of radar backscattering measurements to
vegetation parameters;<p>
		2.  to define validity domains of selected invertible semi-empirical models;
and<p>
		3.  to compute the fitting parameters of semi-empirical models.  <p>
<p>
	c)	Inversion algorithms will be developed in specified domains of validity. <p>
<p>
	d)	Applications on SIR-C/X-SAR data. <p>
<p>
	e)	Interactive process to refine the algorithm. <p>
<p>
III.  ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	 a)	A demonstration of the use of multifrequency, multipolarization, and
multi-incidence angle SIR-C/X-SAR data to probe different parts of a forest
canopy.  Based on past results, we expect to have simple (therefore
convertible) models relating the radar responses to total, woody, and foliar
biomass of pine forests.  These parameters are indicators of forest
productivity, tree disease, and stress conditions, and are required for forest
and ecosystem monitoring.<p>

<p>
	a)	Demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, quantitative measurements of rainfall

Analysis of Optical and Microwave Data to Assess Dynamics of Mexican Tropical
Rain Forest<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
		The major objective of this research are to analyze the effect of structural
differences and successional stages of the tropical forest, on multispectral,
multipolarized and multiple incidence angle data.  <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Monitor deforestation processes in tropical regions, in terms of the actual
distribution and the dynamics of deforestation.  This requires assessing the
temporal variations of the forest.<p>
<p>
	b)	Monitoring phenological variation during the annual cycle, as well as

that provide accurate information in a timely manner.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
			This research will provide basic information about the relationship between
forest parameters and spectral response, radar return, and signal polarization.

The Exploration and Reconstruction of the Middle to Late Cenozoic Drainages of
the Sahara by Means of the SIR-C Mapping<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR data in a synoptic mode with other remotely sensed data,
field, and cartographic data to map relic Cenozoic drainage systems across the
Sahara from the Red Sea Hills, Egypt, to the Chad Basin and Atlantic Ocean.<p>
<p>
	b)	Demonstrate applicability of SIR data, used with Landsat, SPOT and
high-altitude photographic data, as a new, cost-effective remote geophysical
tool for exploration geology. <p>
<p>
	c)	Produce a major report on the distribution of paleodrainages in the Sahara,
their relations to the basic tectonic elements of North Africa (basins and
swells), and their economic potential.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Obtain ancillary  data including local maps, seismic and drill hole logs,
and reports of local researchers, with help of Egyptian and French
co-investigators.<p>
<p>
	b)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR along with Landsat, SPOT, and other data to map Tertiary
stream courses in areas obscured by windblown sand along gaps between
identified paleodrainage segments.  Apply results of SIR-A/B image data
analyses for well-documented sites in Egypt and Sudan to the interpretation of
SIR-C/X-SAR radar images along putative courses of paleodrainages.  Analysis of
headcut patterns in the Mesozoic and older rocks of this region are the key to
this work.<p>
<p>
	c)	Conduct field investigations at critical sites where Cenozoic fluvial
deposits (e.g., old stream sand and gravels) are known or are likely to occur.
(Outside support from local and US. agencies in African countries will be
solicited for detailed subsurface exploration work.)<p>
<p>
	d)	Assess SIR-C signal behavior as it affects our subsurface mapping
capability.  Fully utilize SIR-C/X-SAR regioal mapping capability.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Major contribution to the knowledge of erosional events from middle to late
Tertiary time, which gave rise to the Quaternary geomorphology of North Africa.
Hot humid conditions prevailed during most of the Tertiary, whereas progressive
desiccation set in during the Quaternary.  The effects of this major climatic
shift were to preserve the evidence for earlier geologic events beneath a
veneer of windblown sand.  SIR-C/X-SAR's ability to see through these dry sands
makes our proposed work feasible.<p>
<p>
	b)	A major report will be prepared with accompanying maps that we hope will
have broad scientific and economic applications (for both the public and
private sectors).  Prior work in this region has been limited in scope and
uneven in quality because of the regions heritage of political fragmentation.
SIR-C/X-SAR provides an opportunity for a multi-national effort of regional
synthesis for the Saudi Arabian Peninsula.<p>

<p>
	c)	Exploit the multitemporal capability of SIR-C/X-SAR to isolate the effect
of standing water under the forest canopy from the effect of vegetation by

The Eruptive Styles of Basaltic Shield Volcanoes from Shuttle Imaging Radar-C
(SIR-C) and X-SAR Data<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
	a)	To provide a comprehensive understanding of  the distribution of volcanic
materials on classic examples of basaltic shield volcanoes in Hawaii, Reunion
Island (Indian Ocean) and Galapagos (Eastern Pacific).<p>
<p>
	b) 	Interpret the preserved eruptive history of each volcano, draw contrasts
between each test site in terms of the role of the tectonic setting on basaltic
volcanism, and make inferences about the internal structure of the volcano and
its magma chamber. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Develop criteria for the discrimination of volcanic materials (lava flow
types and ash deposits) using multi-parameter SIR-C/X-SAR data.  Determine the
optimum frequencies, polarizations and incidence angles from the first
SIR-C/X-SAR mission, and obtain data for each volcano during the second mission
in mapping-mode with fixed radar parameters.  Aircraft SAR data from NASA's
DC-8 will be used to help develop these optimum radar parameters, as will field
measurements of local topography and dielectric constant.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Investigate the complete radar scattering matrix for the volcanic surfaces,
using the phase information contained within the quad-pol SIR-C data.  The
radar data will be used to map the distribution of volcanic materials, and
these maps will then be interpreted by both photogeologic and field methods to
assess the style(s) of emplacement of lava flows and ash deposits at each test
site.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED  RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a) 	If Kilauea volcano is still active during the mission, we expect to test
the first near real-time tracking of an active lava flow using radar.  Radar
scattering work in Hawaii will allow us to quantify the types of lavas seen on
other terrestrial volcanoes, thereby permitting an assessment of the eruption
rate of magma on some less well studied volcanoes.	<p>
<p>
	b)	Work in the Galapagos will permit details of the structure and eruptive
history of the seven active volcanoes to be interpreted and compared to active
volcanoes in Hawaii and the Reunion Islands.  Maps of lava flows, craters,
fissures, etc. of the volcanoes in Kamchatka will greatly improve our knowledge
of these poorly known volcanoes.<p>
<p>
	c)	Compare the roles of tectonic setting and spatial variations in activity in
a way that has not been possible before using a uniform data set for physically
separated landforms. <p>
<p>
	d)	To obtain this regional view, we will develop radar scattering models that
enable us to take local test data and extrapolate these observations to the
regional scale.  Such methods are deemed to be particularly important as the
geologic community prepares itself not only to study geographically-isolated
terrestrial landforms using ERS-1, JERS-1, and EOS data sets, but also in the
analysis of planetary volcanic terrains such as those investigated on Venus by
NASA's Magellan spacecraft.<p>

information on the geometry of the area will be obtained.  The aim of the
research is a regional reconstruction of the structural and volcano tectonics
setting and its correlation with plate-tectonics and earthquake epicenter.
This will permit the drawing of updated structural and hydrogeological maps.<p>

Global Biodiversity:  Assessment of Habitat Change and Species Extinctions with
Multiparameter Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
	a)	Study the impact of tropical forest fragmentation on local populations of
endangered and threatened species of certain mammals, butterflies, birds, and
plants.  Vegetation information from SIR-C/X-SAR data over three
tropical-forest intensive-study sites will aid an independent, broader study of
forest fragmentation and its effects on biodiversity.<p>
<p>
	b)	Add the unique, detailed information on forest fragmentation from
spacecraft-based SAR to the broader study begun in 1988. <p>
<p>
	c)	Use imaging data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Advanced Very-High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to assess on a biome scale, but with less spatial
resolution than that of the SIR-C/X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
	d)	Evaluate the use of the unique information about forest distributions and
stand conditions expected from multiparameter synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
relative to that from the MSS and AVHRR. <p>
<p>
II.  APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Species diversity and population dynamics are affected by the size, degree
of isolation, and condition of forest habitats.(e.g., due to cultural
deforestation or natural disturbances such as fire).  The broader project will
predict the changes in endangerment status of mammals, birds, butterflies, and
certain plant groups in the subject tropical areas.  To assess the impact of
remotely-sensed forest changes, the investigators in the broader study will use
a combination of ecological simulation modeling, biogeographic theory, a global
georeferenced database of species occurrence, abundance, and habitat
preferences, and field data on the response of subject species to habitat
fragmentation. <p>
<p>
	b)	While much information is expected from the independent study through the
use of data from the MSS and AVHRR, SIR-C/X-SAR data will provide unique
information about forest conditions.  A biome-wide study using SAR could not be
done with the limited SIR-C/X-SAR data (taken over two one-week periods); this
broader application of SAR data, if proven feasible in the SIR-C/X-SAR project,
would have to await EOS SAR or other long-term radar systems to be in Earth
orbit in the 1990's and beyond. <p>
<p>
		1.	Specifically, data from the multiparameter SIR-C SAR [especially from
L-band multipolarization channels] will be useful in distinguishing between
closed forest (100% canopy closure), woodland (50-99% canopy closure), open
woodland (10-49% canopy closure), shrub land, and grassland.  Furthermore, we
expect quantitative information on early forest regrowth.<p>
<p>
		2.	Recent results (Ulaby, et al., 1986) from studies of textural information
in a block of SAR pixels suggests that forests of different types and stages of
maturity may have qualitative differences in textural properties useful for
forest-habitat characterization.  Differentiation of successional stages of
recovery in the tropics will add to model precision, both for the biodiversity
project and for other research goals.  Also, if standing water exists beneath
forests, L-band SAR data often responds (presents a brighter image) in a way
that such areas can be delineated.<p>
<p>
III.  ANTICIPATED RESULTS <p>

Synthetic Aperture Radar Ocean Imaging Physics<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Gain a better understanding of SAR ocean surface imaging physics by
comparing SIR-C/X-SAR data, coincident airborne SAR under flights, perhaps
coincident ERS-1 SAR data, and <i>in situ </i>directional wave spectrum
measurements and ocean observations.<p>
<p>
	b)	Study surface gravity waves, internal waves, mesoscale features, wind
signatures, and ship detection.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Four study sites will be selected.  The first site corresponds to a
nominally winter SIR-C/X-SAR flight, and is centered upon the edge of the
marginal ice zone off the coast of Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean.  The
second site corresponds to a nominally summer SIR-C/X-SAR flight, and is off
the West coast of Vancouver Island near the entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait in
the Pacific Ocean.  The third site is in the Tasman Sea and the fourth site is
the East Australia Current.  These four study sites will present a variety of
ocean features and conditions for study in a multi-sensor experiment.  <p>
<p>
	b)	The ocean wave analysis will center around conversion of SAR imagery into
reliable directional wave height spectra.  Particular emphasis will be placed
upon inter-sensor comparisons, and the inclusion of optimal SAR processing
schemes such as adaptive multi-look processing and the explicit inclusion of
noncoherent scene motion effects.  <p>
<p>
	c)	Mesoscale ocean features will be tracked via AVHRR imagery and subsequently
searched for in the resulting SAR imagery.  Internal gravity wave signatures
will be analyzed for wavelength and corresponding propagation velocities will
be compared with those predicted by <i>in situ</i> CTD surveys.  Wind
signatures will be searched for in the data and correlated with the winds
predicted by surface pressure maps.  Ship detection exercises will be based
upon observations of the research vessels present in the study site, and any
chance observations of icebergs in the winter study site.  <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Improved understanding of the SAR imaging of ocean surface waves,
particularly the dependence of aspects of the SAR geometry, operating
configurations, and SAR processing upon the image fidelity of surface gravity
waves with an azimuthal wavenumber component.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Optimal SAR geometries and processing schemes for the observation of
internal waves, mesoscale features, wind signatures, and hard targets in sea
clutter will be established.<p>

Imaging Radar Data Analysis for Forest Ecosystem Modeling<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES <p>
<p>
		The overall objective of this proposed work is to capitalize on and develop
the unique advantages of satellite imaging radar data combined with models of
forest ecosystem dynamics for characterizing northern/boreal forest ecosystems,
especially with regard to the interpretation of landscape patterns and
processes at local and regional scales.  Specific objectives are: <p>
<p>
	a)	Use radar observations to help infer where landscape pattern and process
ecosystem models succeed or fail at regional spatial scales and inter-annual
temporal scales. <p>
<p>
	b)	Use radar data to check potentially observable forest ecosystem model
predicted attributes.<p>
<p>
	c)	Use radar observations and models to extract biophysical properties of
forest canopies, soils and hydrologic parameters used in our forest ecosystem
models. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH <p>
<p>
	a)	Use standard SAR image processing and analysis techniques (e.g., to first
extract radar channels and then map the changes in composition, species and gap
size distributions) to characterize ecosystem states over selected and modeled
study sites.  AIRSAR aircraft missions over our intensive sites will be used to
guide our later satellite radar analyses.<p>
<p>
	b)	Analyses of field and aircraft data collected over our study sites will be
used to explore quasi-statistical relationships between measured response and
ecosystem attributes.  These relationships may then be applied to satellite
collected data to make more detailed checks on ecosystem model performance. <p>
<p>
	c)	Physically based radar models will be applied to existing and field
collected data over subsets of our study sites to examine radar and optical
scattering from different scene components, useful for objectives a) and b)
above, and to develop model inversion strategies for selected ecosystem model
input parameters. <p>
<p>
III. 	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	The utility of space-borne SAR for guiding the conditions under which
ecosystem model assumptions can be relaxed, or conversely, where new mechanisms
must be incorporated into models applied at these relatively unexplored spatial
scales will be demonstrated. <p>
<p>
	b)	A further tool for evaluating detailed model processes will be explored
especially in the regional spatial domain where more traditional methods are
difficult to apply. <p>
<p>
	c)	Extract canopy structural parameters from radar observations which can be
applied to optical radiative transfer models important for calculating the
internal and external radiation regime, or vice versa.<p>

	<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To determine the optimum SIR sensor configuration for detection of desert

SIR-C Studies of the Precambrian Hamisana and Nakasib Structures, NE Sudan, in
Arid Regions of Low Relief and in the Subsurface<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	Develop techniques for optimizing structural analysis of basement trends in
arid regions with extremely subdued topography and/or thin aeolian cover.<p>
<p>
	b)	Apply results of a) to map the southern extension of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and the western extension of Nakasib Suture.<p>
<p>
	c)	Apply results of b) to constrain the roles of terrane accretion and
strike-slip re-organization for late Precambrian crustal evolution in NE
Africa.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Pre- and post-mission field studies will focus on defining the major
basement structures of the NE Sudan to determine their deformational history
and orientation of structural fabrics.<p>
<p>
	b)	Interface with ongoing LANDSAT TM and field studies of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and initiate similar studies for the Nakasib Suture.  Ancillary data is
also requested (i.e., hand-held photography, large format camera).<p>
<p>
	c)	During the first SIR-C/X-SAR flight, we will determine the best
configuration of radar parameters for resolving the structures in the study
area.  The following will assist in this determination.<p>
<p>
		1.	Dual frequency (L-and C-band or L- and X-band), like polarized (V-V or
H-H).  Penetration is inversely proportional to frequency, so comparison of L
with C- or X-bands should allow discrimination of surface vs. subsurface
effects.<p>
<p>
		2.	Single frequency (L-band), dual polarization (V-V or H-H) and (V-H or
H-V).  This will allow examination of possible polarization effects in
subsurface and near-surface features.<p>
<p>
		3.	Incidence angle should be as high as possible, to mimic as much as
possible a SEASAT imaging configuration.  This will maximize weak returns off
the subsurface and will enhance subtle topographic features in this low relief
terrain.  Some of these may have structural significance due to preferential
erosion.<p>
<p>
	d)	Second flight experiment should get coverage over the same area using
approaches iv) a) and b), to the extent possible to determine the best
configuration for the subsequent experiment.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Better understanding of the southern continuation of the Hamisana Shear
Zone and the western continuation of the Nakasib Suture and the sequence of
deformational events (collisions, strike slip faulting, etc) that led to the
formation of the continental crust of this poorly known region.  This will
better constrain models linking the major basement structures of NE Africa and
those of the Mozambique Belt of East Africa.<p>
<p>
	b)	Better understanding of the imaging techniques necessary for elucidating
buried and low-relief structures in arid terrains.<p>
<p>
	c)	Better understanding of the radar signature of suture zones and strike-slip
zones of deformation in terrains and climates analogous to those expected on
planetary surfaces such as Venus.<p>

The Evaluation of SIR-C Imagery for Surficial Sediment Mapping and Groundwater
Management in Australia<p>
<p>
I.  OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To assess the utility of multipolarization multifrequency spaceborne radar
for  surficial  sediment  mapping  (4.2.5.3.  lithology, rock weathering and
geochronology, Science Plan) and groundwater management (4.3.5.1, arid regimes,
Science Plan) in a variety of Australian environments. <p>
<p>
	b)	To establish the utility of the SIR-C imagery for recognizing basement
structures (4.2.5.4, tectonics and geologic boundaries, Science Plan) by
mapping drape-related fractures in overlying surficial sediments. <p>
<p>
II.  APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Sites have been selected across Australia so as to cover a range of
sedimentary environments from arid to temperate. <p>
<p>
	b)	Sites at Kerang, Palm Valley, Fowlers Gap, Cooper Creek, Lake Eyre and
Condobolin contain Precambrian and Devonian sediment outcrops, Tertiary and
Quaternary sediments, and fresh and saltwater lake systems.  A large data base
of remotely sensed imagery covering these regions is already available. <p>
<p>
	c)	The study will involve image analysis and enhancement.  Detailed ground
investigations will involve petrology, surface roughness determinations,
moisture measurements, dielectric constant determinations, salinity analyses,
and signal calibration. <p>
<p>
	d)	Studies will be extended along swath into differing hydrological
environments each with particular water-management problems.  Sites within the
Murray Darling Basin, Cooper Creek/Diamantina Rivers and Simpson Desert will be
included. <p>
<p>
	e)	Block faulting in Devonian to Cretaceous age sediments in petroleum bearing
sediments in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins is propagated upwards into
overlying Tertiary to recent sediment cover.  Comparative studies of these
drape-related features employing lineament analyses from several remotely
sensed data bases and the SIR-C/X-SAR imagery will be carried out at
along-swath study sites. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Map surficial deposits of different type and age by surface roughness,
sub-surface volume scattering, cross-polarization returns and phase difference
images.  These maps will have important consequences for the recognition of
potential aquifer materials in arid and semi-arid regions. <p>
<p>
	b)	Map seepage zones in areas of internal drainage and saltlake formation
using variations in dielectric constant to determine moisture contents and
conducting salt layers.  These maps will be important to understanding natural
salt-lake systems and salinity management in irrigation areas such as the
Murray Darling Basin and elsewhere in the world. <p>
<p>
	c)	Demonstrate that spaceborne radar is a powerful tool for mapping basement
tectonic features through overlying surficial sediments.  While having
implications for petroleum exploration, this will also be important for
recognizing high permeability zones for the siting of water wells. <p>
<p>
	d)	Test the effect on varying amounts of vegetation cover on our ability to
achieve these results. <p>

Polarimetric Radar Observations of Forest State for Determination of Ecosystem
Process<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	The objectives of this research are to test the hypotheses that
ecologically significant forest state parameters may be estimated from SAR
data.  These include estimation of above ground biomass, plant water status,
and near surface soil moisture under certain forest conditions.<p>
<p>
	b)	Test hypotheses in the northern hardwoods forest community, refine them if
necessary, and establish techniques for retrieving this information from
orbital SARs such as SIR-C/X-SAR.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	The study will be conducted in three phases as follows:<p>
<p>
		1.  Monitor the dielectric and geometric properties of selected forest
canopies on a diurnal and seasonal basis.  Use these values to simulate radar
backscatter as a function of frequency, polarization, incidence angle, and
range into the canopy as a function of time using the Michigan Microwave Canopy
Scattering Model (MIMICS).  Simulations will be evaluated on the basis of
concurrent multifrequency, polarimetric backscatter observations using
AIRSAR.<p>
<p>
		2.  Refine initial hypotheses on the basis of sensitivity studies generated
using MIMICS for a range of forest stand conditions existing at the test site
area near the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS).  Studies will
use databases established at UMBS over the last 78 years.  An airborne SAR
program will be conducted prior to SIR-C/X-SAR to test these hypotheses under
heterogeneous field conditions and evaluate retrieval techniques derived from
inversions of the MIMICS model.<p>
<p>
		3.  Demonstrate the utility and the lateral geographic extendibility of these
retrieval techniques beyond the study region using SIR-C/X-SAR data.  Issues of
sensor calibration are critical to this phase and on-site external calibration
techniques will therefore be applied throughout the experimental program.<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Determination of the dynamic range of radar backscatter from northern
hardwood canopies in response to diurnal, daily, and seasonal dynamics.<p>
<p>
	b)	Validation of a robust forest canopy scattering model (MIMICS) which can
then be applied to other forest conditions.<p>
<p>
	c)	Definition of the retrieval techniques and their respective accuracies.
Evaluate the limitations for each hypothesis.<p>

I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>

<p>
	b)	This instrumentation will be accurately calibrated, using an anecoic
chamber and an antenna range.  Prototypes of the instrumentation will be
field-tested during the future airborne SAR campaigns in preparation for the
SIR-C/X-SAR missions.<p>
<p>
	c)	The multiangle capability and/or a slight shift between successive orbits
will provide images of the test area under different illumination angles. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>

campaigns to design, test, and operate a set of ad-hoc multifrequency
instrumentation for SAR calibration and data validation.<p>
<p>
	b)	Integration of the calibration data with raw SAR data for fine tuning of
processor parameters.<p>
<p>
	c)	Evaluation of the potential of SAR interferometry for topographic mapping,
based on point targets of known radar cross-section (RCS), geographic
coordinates, and phase behavior.<p>
<p>
	d)	Improvement of the existing RCS databases.<p>

<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Selection of a test site which would provide a wide spectrum of soil
moisture, vegetation and surface roughness for SIR-C/X-SAR observations.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Request of aircraft polarimeter and radiometer flights before and during

Information Extraction from Shuttle Radar Images for Forest Applications<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVE<p>
<p>
	a)	The experiment will attempt to extract all possible information from
shuttle borne radar images (SAR) for areas with forest stands.<p>
<p>
	b)	Use extracted information to evaluate/characterize forest parameters
including differentiation between coniferous and deciduous forests, tree stand
geometry, seasonal changes.  Specific radar-tree interaction schemes including
dependence of leaf/needle geometry and alignment to radar backscatter will also
be investigated.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Forested areas to be studied in the experiment will comprise the range from
non-forest/deforested areas to bushland areas, reforested areas and finally,
small groves to large woodlands. <p>
<p>
	b)	The experiment and the proposed data processing algorithms will utilize
mainly the X-band SAR data in one polarization, but will also take advantage of
the SIR-C L- and C-band data with different polarization and look-angles. <p>
<p>
	c)	The experiment will use geocoded images to co-register the radar data with
other geocoded satellite-borne images including multiband TM data and high
resolution  SPOT data.  The strong dependence of radar data on topographic
relief will make the incorporation of digital elevation models (DEM) necessary.
<p>
<p>
	d)	To obtain information for forest applications the principal backscatter
mechanisms of microwaves with trees, trunks, leaves, and needles must be known.
Three main parameters can be identified:<p>
<p>
		1.	<i>Radar parameters:</i> These are wavelength, polarization and incidence
angle.  The SIR-C/X-SAR mission will vary all parameters, delivering a maximum
flexibility to the investigators. <p>
<p>
		2.	<i>Target parameters:</i>  These can be further sub-divided in geometric
parameters such as roughness, density, pattern, height, and dielectric property
parameters which are mainly influenced by the moisture content of the canopy.
Especially the tree/forest geometry could allow a classification of different
species from SAR images. <p>
<p>
		3.	<i>Underlying soil parameters:</i>  Mainly the surface roughness and the
dielectric properties of the soil which are governed by humidity. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Differentiation of forested and non-forested areas with an assessment of
the accuracy of separation.<p>
<p>
	b)	Information on the tree stand geometry, age classes of trees, and seasonal
changes.<p>

SIR-C Radar Investigations of Volcanism and Tectonism in the Northern Andes<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVE<p>
<p>
	a)	Increase understanding of the volcano-tectonic history of the Northern
Andes of Colombia and Ecuador by testing and extending the volcano-tectonic
segmentation model proposed by Hall and Wood (1985).<p>
<p>
	b)	Develop radar models for detecting and mapping pyroclastic and mudflow
deposits at Ruiz and other dangerous volcanoes of the Northern Andes.<p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	a)	Use SIR-C/X-SAR images to examine areas identified by Hall and Wood as
having anomalous volcano-tectonic characteristics; e.g., determine if young
volcanoes uncertainly glimpsed in Landsat images of south-central Colombia
exist; search for caldera (?) source of extensive, young ashflows in southern
Ecuador; map tectonic details of surface area above apparent collision of
adjacent subducted slabs.<p>
<p>
	b)	For forested volcanic areas, develop statistical characterizations of
terrain morphologies (canopy morphologies) to recognize and classify
volcaniclastic terranes of various ages.  For vegetation-free areas, develop
theoretical scattering models based on the statistical roughness
characteristics of volcaniclastic terranes of different ages.  These models
will be tested against the multi-wavelength, quad-polarized radar signatures of
the volcanic terranes at Ruiz volcano (eruptions in 1986, 1945, 1595),
Do&ntilde;a Juana (1897), Guagua Pichincha (1660), Cotopaxi (1877), and
Tungurahua (1916).<p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	Greatly improve geologic knowledge of poorly mapped, frequently
cloud-covered, volcanically active arc.<p>
<p>
	b)	Discover currently unknown source structure for large, 14,000 year old
ashflow deposit in southern Ecuador.<p>
<p>
	c)	Increase understanding of a seismically unusal subduction setting.<p>
<p>
	d)	Develop an optimal interpretation of radar data for detection and mapping
of pyroclastic/lahar deposits in tropical environments.<p>
<p>
	e)	Improve understanding of distribution and character of poorly mapped
deposits at Ruiz and other explosive volcanoes in the area.<p>
<p>
	f)	Recognize prehistoric Ruiz-like deposits around other North Andean
volcanoes and hence increase awareness of volcanic hazards.<p>

Multifrequency Imaging Radar Polarimetry:  Geophysical Factors from Penetration
Phenomena<p>
<p>
I.	OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
	a)	To model, experimental]y characterize, and verify penetration phenomena in
hyperarid and vegetated regions using the SIR-C/X-SAR multiparameter radar
system and groundbased receivers.<p>
<p>
	b)	To invert measured radar backscatter as a function of frequency and
polarization in terms of geophysical parameters of the surface, subsurface and
vegetation canopy such as surface roughness, subsurface geomorphology, or tree
height and density.<p>
 <p>
	c)	To display subsurface and within-canopy features in an image format, thus
easing the interpretability of the results. <p>
<p>
II.	APPROACH<p>
<p>
	The approach we propose is utilization of multifrequency polarimetry to
separate and characterize the radar return into surface and volume scattering
components.  Specifically, we will:<p>
<p>
	a)	Model the backscatter from hyperarid and vegetated areas in terms of the
geophysical parameters describing in particular subsurface and within-canopy
structure and composition. <p>
<p>
	b)	Collect SIR-C and supporting aircraft multifrequency polarimetric data.  <p>
<p>
	c)	Separate the measured return into surface and subsurface or within-canopy
parts based on polarimetric behavior as a function of frequency. <p>
<p>
	d)	Deploy ground receivers during the experiment to measure field strengths at
both vertical and horizontal polarizations.  These in situ measurements will
constrain and confirm our theoretical models. <p>
<p>
	e)	Invert the measured scattering characteristics in terms of the modeled
geophysical parameters. <p>
<p>
III.	ANTICIPATED RESULTS<p>
<p>
	a)	An increased understanding of penetration phenomena in scattering.  <p>
<p>
	b)	Identification of sources for backscatter in hyperarid subsurface imaging,
and quantitative assessment of the relative contribution of canopy top, volume,
and ground surface scattering components to the return signal from vegetation
canopies. <p>
<p>
	c)	Solutions for descriptive geophysical parameters in the supersites studied.
These results would be of great use to any investigators interpreting images
acquired over similar targets by SIR-C or any other radar system. <p>

Introduction
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
	The JPL/NASA Spaceborne Imaging Radar - C (SIR-C) flew on two missions  of the
Space Shuttle Endeavour during 1994  - STS-59 in April 1994, and STS-68 in
Sept-Oct 1994.  These two successful missions resulted in a large number of
images of the surface of the Earth.  These images are what the surface of the
Earth looks like at two radio frequencies ("L-band" and "C-Band").   <p>
	Each frequency of the SIR-C radar consisted of a fully polarimetric radar.
This means that the SIR-C radar obtained between one and four  "channels" of
data (where the actual number of channels obtained for a given datatake depend
on the commands to the radar during the missions)- these different channels of
data are sensitive to the scattering mechanisms that occur when the radio waves
are reflected back to the radar.  <p>
	A third frequency ("X-band") was provided by the XSAR radar - the data from
this radar is not compressed, and this software should not be used on it.
Information about the XSAR data can be found at
http://www.dfd.dlr.de/xsar/Welcome.html .  Together, SIR-C and XSAR comprised
the Shuttle Radar Laboratory 1 and 2  (SRL-1, SRL-2) on STS-59 and STS-68,
respectively.<p>
	The SIR-C data from these missions were processed on the ground from the raw
signal data and were saved to CEOS format compressed data files (CEOS is an
internationally recognized format for remote sensing data).  One file per
frequency was generated.   The compression is necessary to save the different
polarization channels in the smallest possible number of bytes of disk space.
Even with this compression, these data files are typically hundreds of
megabytes of digital data;   thousands of square kilometers of Earth at  pixel
spacings as little as 5 meters are saved in this unique data structure,
designed specifically for polarimetric SAR data.<p>
	Many users of SIR-C data are not radar "experts" and just want to see what the
image looks like (even radar experts want to do that!).   Many users do not
want to worry about the file compression or how to decompress the data. (For
users that are interested in more sophisticated analysis of the data,  JPL and
others have developed additional software tools - information about some of
these products may be found at http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software.html).<p>
	The SIR-C project defined a new data product called db-byte files to satisfy
the above concerns.  These files are now created along with the CEOS compressed
image files (as of February 2, 1996).  The software described in this manual is
meant to create these db-byte files from CEOS data products, especially for
those datatakes  processed prior to February 2, 1996.<p>
	The db_byte_cr program will read in a compressed image file and some ascii
header files and create a db-byte image for each polarimetric channel present.
These "db-byte" files do not contain all the polarimetric information that the
compressed files have, and because they are 8 bit images, information has been
lost,  but they are smaller (tens of megabytes, typically), and many software
packages can display and analyze them. <p>
	The db_byte_cr program assumes that the CEOS leader and image file have been
decoded and written to your computers hard disk by another JPL  computer
program called ceos_reader (more information about this program can be found at
http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software.html).  Instructions on how to do this
pre-processing step are provided in this manual.<p>
	The db_byte_cr program will create a separate byte (sometimes called "raw")
image file for each polarization channel present.  Each file will start with a
VICAR label. VICAR stands for Video Image Communication and Retrieval - more
information about this header format can be found at
http://www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/vicar.html .  The SIR-C db-byte vicar label will
be described in this manual.  This ASCII header to the file may be used to
determine how to display it.<p>
	The db-byte file created yields more than just a pretty picture.  Each  Data
Number (DN) , i.e. byte pixel value,  corresponds to a "sigma0" value.   These
DN's ranges from 0 to 255 or -127 to 128 , depending on whether or not it is
interpreted with a sign bit or not .  These DN's are mapped to sigma0 values
between -40.2 dB to +10.8 dB (most natural targets will fall within this
range).  Sigma0 is a measure of the radar  brightness of the target.
Therefore, the db-byte images can be used for limited scientific analysis.
However, each increment in DN will correspond to a 0.2 db increment in Sigma0,
so users should be cautious of the quantization noise when doing any
quantitative analysis.  <b>The db-byte software assumes that the data is
calibrated.  If the data is not calibrated, then an uncalibrated byte image of
the amplitude will be created instead.  This will be indicated during program
execution and also within the vicar header of the file.</b><p>
	Because dB is a logarithmic scale, the db-byte images will be stretched in a
log fashion.  Some image processing programs can help stretch the data in other
ways if desired (the log stretch is not optimum for display!).  In order to
convert the dB values to linear power ratio values, simply raise 10 to the
power of one tenth the dB value.<p>
	If the radar was "right looking" the data will appear to be a mirror image of
the ground in the CEOS compressed data files.  Therefore, to avoid this
problem, if the radar is right-looking, the image is flipped left/right for the
db-byte files (except for geocoded data products which are already flipped).<p>
	A simple program to read the db-byte files and convert individual pixel
coordinates to db values is included with this package.  This program is called
db_byte_read.<p>
	The db_byte_cr and the db_byte_read programs are written in standard FORTRAN
77, and should work on any computer, though I have only tried it on UNIX
operating systems.  If you have the source code rather than an executable for
your computer, a makefile has been  included with the software for compilation
ease.<p>
	At the Imaging Radar Home Page (http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/), more
information can be obtained about how to get SIR-C data, software updates and
information, educational materials, and a technical bulletin board in which you
may ask the radar community questions about SAR data.<p>
	Please contact the author if you need any assistance.<p>
<b>2. How to Get Data 
<a name="RTFToC2">2</b>.
<b>How to get data 
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Obviously, before this software is of much use, you will have to obtain
or already have SIR-C data.  There are several types of data available -
information about how to obtain SIR-C  is available at the imaging radar home
page http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/scienceapps/data.html .<p>
<p>
	Survey data :  This data is available over the web, and may be accessed from
http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html .  This data comes on CD-ROM,
and are byte images with no header.  This data is lower resolution, and only
one frequency.  All the data from the two SIR-C missions is available in this
format.<p>
	Precision data :  This data may be ordered over the web from the EROS data
center as well (http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/precision/), but the
files are two large for file transfer over the internet - the data will be sent
on 8mm tape (the only format available).  This is the data that the db_byte_cr
software assumes that you have (in the CEOS format).  The precision data
consists of compressed radar data.  Not all the SIR-C data has been processed
to this level.<p>
	db-byte data :  db-byte data is a new data product.  The db_byte_read software
will read pixel values from these files as well.  They are very similar to the
output from the db_byte_cr program, but the vicar headers are slightly
different.  This data product is now available from the Eros Data Center (URL
TBD as I write this - check the imaging radar home page at
http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/scienceapps/data.html).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3. Pre-processing by the CEOS_READER Software 
<a name="RTFToC3">3</b>.
<b>Pre-processing by the CEOS_READER Software 
</a></b><p>
<p>
	<p>
	Before converting the SIR-C CEOS compressed image files to the db-byte
format, the user will have to run the ceos_reader program.  This program reads
the SIR-C CEOS format tape, decodes the headers, writes the data to disk, and
strips the image file of its header and its 12 byte CEOS prefix.  These decoded
files are the ones required by the db_byte_cr software.  The ceos_reader
program is available by license from JPL - please take a look at the imaging
radar home page http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software.html  for more

	First, make sure that you have SIR-C compressed image files on a CEOS tape -
If you have a CD-ROM, then it is NOT a CEOS tape, and you do not need to use
the ceos_reader or db_byte_cr.  The CEOS tapes are on 8mm tapes (2 or 5 Gbyte
format), and say that they are ceos tapes on the label.  Another type of tape
is an "archive tape" - this type of tape is a UNIX tar tape and needs a
different version of the software -  the person who gave you this tape should
be able to tell you what software you will need.<p>
	So, now we know that you have a ceos tape, an 8 mm tape drive, a UNIX
computer,  and plenty of disk space.  Now, you should run the ceos_reader
software :<p>
<p>
<u>read data from tape and create ASCII CEOS header files</u><p>
<u></u><p>
1.   run <b>ceos_reader</b> software to copy a data set to disk<p>
	a.  make a directory on a disk with plenty of disk space for the data<p>
	b.  run <b>ceos_reader</b><p>
<p>
<i>		&gt; ceos_reader tape=/dev/nrmt0h</i><p>
<i>		1 - continue</i><p>
<i>		1 - product menu</i><p>
<i>		3 - copy</i><p>
<i>		return</i><p>
<i>		return</i><p>
<i>		return</i><p>
<i>		0</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	c.  this command copies the ceos header files and the image file to disk<p>
d.  if there is more than one ceos data set on the tape, run the ceos_reader
again without rewinding.<p>
e.  /dev/nrmt0h is the tape device.<p>
<p>
2.  run <b>ceos_reader</b> create ASCII header files<p>
	a.  run <b>ceos_reader</b><p>
		<p>
<i>		&gt;  ceos_reader disk=pr10542_img_ceos</i><p>
<i>		1 - continue</i><p>
<i>		2 - file</i><p>
<i>		3 - decode/save</i><p>
<i>		return</i><p>
<i>		return</i><p>

	b. similarly execute (and proceed as before)<p>

<i>  		&gt;  ceos_reader disk=pr10542_tlr_ceos</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	</i>c.  this creates the ASCII CEOS header files<p>
	d.  It is also possible to do this directly from the tape files - see the
manual for the ceos_reader software.<p>

<b>4. db_byte_cr</b>  <b>Program Execution
<a name="RTFToC4">4.
db_byte_cr</b> <b>Program Execution
</a></b><p>
<p>
	Each SIR-C datatake has a "processing run number" associated with it.  This
number is a five digit number, usually beginning with a 1 or a 4, where 1
denotes data from SRL-1, and 4 denotes data from SRL-2.<p>
	Before running the db_byte_cr program, first do a directory listing, and make
sure the following files are present :<p>
<p>
prXXXXX_img_ceos_image<p>
prXXXXX_img_ceos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_ldr_ceos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_radioplot_ZXY	(Z=wavelength band, XY = polarization)	<p>
<p>
where XXXXX is the processing run number. (if the CEOS image files have been
geocoded, the filenames will have ceos replaced with geos). These files were
created by the ceos_reader software.  The first file is the actual compressed
image file and should be very large (hundreds of megabytes in most cases),
while the other two are ascii header files - you can display them with the UNIX
more command. There will be one radioplot file per available polarization (HH,
HV, VH, or VV) and band (L or C). Other files should be present as well, but
these files are the only ones that db_byte_cr needs.  If all three are not
present, then the db_byte_cr program will not work.<p>
<p>
<u>Create the db-byte files from the decoded CEOS files</u><p>
<u></u>	1.   <b>run db_byte_cr</b><p>
<b></b>	 &gt;<i>db_byte_cr</i><p>
<i></i>	<i>10542</i>	(processing run number)<p>
	<i>0</i>		(a UNIX computer other than DEC or SGI)<p>
<p>
	The db_byte_cr program will now calculate and create the available db-byte
files - if you have single pol data, you will get one output db-byte file, if
you have dual pol data, you will get two output db-byte files, and if you have
quad-pol data, you will get three db-byte files (a db-byte file will NOT be
made for the vh channel since it is very similar to the hv channel.)<p>
	The names of the output files will be :<p>
<p>
prXXXXX_vicar_byte_xy<p>
<p>
where x and y are the transmit and receive polarization's (either h or v).<p>
<b>5. VICAR Header Description </b><p>

VICAR Header Description 
</a></b><p>
	The vicar header will be at the start of every db-byte file.  VICAR stands for
Video Image Communication and Retrieval - more information about this header
format can be found at http://www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/vicar.html .  <p>
	Most of the contents of the vicar label that are specific to the db-byte files
are self-explanatory.  The first dozen or so elements are required by the vicar
definition and define the size of the file, for instance the number of samples
(NS) and the number of lines (NL).  Here is an example vicar label to a db-byte
file:<p>

	The vicar header is an ascii header.  It is included so that users can get a
brief description of the file.  In addition, the semi-public domain program XV
(versions 2.21 and 3.10 but NOT v3.00) can display these files as is.  In
addition, if you use the UNIX more command, you will be able to read the vicar
label.<p>
	If you want to display the db-byte files with programs other than XV
(described in the previous chapter), typically you just need to get an image
processing program that accepts raw, byte images - Many commercial packages
have this option.  The "width" of the image is the number of samples (NS in the
vicar label), and the "height" of the image is the number of lines (NL in the
vicar label).<p>
	The vicar label is allocated to take up to 1400 bytes of the file.  In
addition, if the vicar label is shorter than the length of the line, then it
will be padded with spaces to fill the line.  If each line is less than 1400
bytes, the remainder will be written to the following lines, with the last line
padded with spaces to fill the line.<p>
	When processing the SIR-C data to the compressed image format, sometimes these
db-byte files were created along with the compressed image files.  However, due
to technical reasons, the vicar label created by db_byte_cr  has slightly
differents contents.  The number of lines and samples is the same.<p>
	If the data is NOT calibrated, this will be indicated within the vicar label
under several categories.<p>
	<p>
<b>6. Explanation of DN Values 
<a name="RTFToC6">6.</b>
<b>Explanation of DN Values 
</a></b><p>
<b>	</b>The DN values follow the vicar label in the file.  The definition of
the file is meant to satisfy users quantitative as well as qualitative needs :
The DN values are coded to the db value of the radar backscattered cross
section (sigma0), so that some limited quantitative analysis can be performed;
as well as being image values that can be displayed and printed.  <p>
	Each DN  is an 8 bit number that ranges from 0 to 255 (or, if interpreted as
having a sign bit, -127 to 128).  If you interpreted as having a sign bit, you
should first translate it to unsigned (0 to 255).<p>
	A DN of 0 corresponds to a db value of -40.2 db.  Each unit change in DN
corresponds to a change of 0.2 db.  A DN of 255 therefore corresponds to +10.8
db.  Therefore, values can be converted from DN to db by the following formula
:<p>
<p>
	db-value=-40.2 + 0.2 * DN	<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>These db values are a power ratio and were obtained by measuring the
ratio of the backscattered energy to that of an isotropic scatterer. <p>
	<b>The db-byte software assumes that the data is calibrated. </b> If the data
is not calibrated, then an uncalibrated byte image of the amplitude will be
created instead.  This will be indicated during program execution and also
within the vicar header of the file<b>.  There is no formula to convert these
uncalibrated byte values to db.</b>  If the data is uncalibrated, the byte
files generated should not be used for quantitative analysis, but for display
purposes only.  Some data from the SIR-C data is NOT calibrated, so be sure
that you know whether or not the data is calibrated before attempting to
analyze the data.<p>
	In db-byte files created by the SIR-C processor, a DN of 0 indicates filler
data (or sigma0's less than -40db).  However, from the precision data products
filler data can not be distinguished from sigma0's less than -40db.<p>
	Values below -40db and above 10.8 db will be saturated.<p>

	This appendix will describe the 5 most common data formats for SIR-C data.  It
does not describe the CEOS format or the CEOS header definitions.  For that,
users should refer to the CEOS data file definitions [3].  For SIR-C  there are
three possible <b>compressed</b> data formats and two 8 bit formats:<p>
<p>
	Appendix A.1  compressed cross-products data (MLC)  (Multilook data) CEOS
format<p>
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel<p>
		 	 dual-pol 5 bytes per pixel <p>
<p>
	Appendix A.2  compressed detected data (MLD)  (Multilook data) CEOS  format<p>
			 single-pol, 2 bytes per pixel<p>
<p>
	Appendix A.3  compressed scattering matrix data (SLC)  (Singlelook data) CEOS
format<p>
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel<p>
			 dual-pol, 6 bytes per pixel<p>
			 single-pol, 4 bytes per pixel <p>
<p>
	Appendix A.4 db-byte data<p>
			quad, dual, and single pol - 1 byte per pixel (coded to db)<p>
<p>
	Appendix A.5 survey data<p>
			One polarization onle - 1 byte per pixel<p>
<p>
	In the following descriptions:<p>
	<p>
		<b>sign( ) </b>will return the sign of the argument ( +/- 1) <p>
<p>
		<b>nint( ) </b>will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of
its argument.  <p>
<p>
		<b>int( ) </b>will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value
to integer is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value
is less than zero, subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this
is <u>not </u>the same as FORTRAN int( ).<p>

</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The db-byte format is an 8 bit representation of each available channel of
data (hh, hv, vh, or vv - though if quad pol only hv and not vh is created) per
frequency.  Each file will start with a VICAR label. VICAR stands for Video
Image Communication and Retrieval - more information about this header format
can be found at http://www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/vicar.html .<p>
	The names of the db-byte  files will be :<p>
<b>prXXXXX_vicar_byte_xy</b><p>
<b></b>	where x and y are the transmit and receive polarization's (either h or
v).<p>
	Each  Data Number (DN) value corresponds to a "sigma0" value.   These  DN's
ranges from 0 to 255 or -127 to 128 , depending of whether or not it is
interpreted with a sign bit or not .  These DN's are mapped to sigma0 values
between -40.2 dB to +10.8 dB (most natural targets will fall within this
range).  Sigma0 is a measure of the brightness of the target.  Therefore, the
db-byte images can be used for limited scientific analysis.  However, each
increment in DN will correspond to a 0.2 db increment in Sigma0, so users
should be cautious of the quantization noise when doing any quantitative
analysis.  <p>

is uncalibrated, this is indicated in the vicar label  "uncalibrated byte image
of Amplitude (not Power)".  In that case, the DN's will not correspond to db
values, and quantitative analysis of the data is not recommended.<p>
	The number of samples (bytes) per line may be found in the vicar label (NS),
as well as the number of lines (NL) - <b>the number of lines includes the vicar
header, as the vicar header overwrites the first line or so of the data</b>.
The file will then be structured as :<p>
<p>
-------------<p>
header (1400 bytes + fill to NS bytes)<p>
data line -&gt; NS bytes<p>
.<p>
.<p>
.<p>
NL - number of vicar lines of data<p>
-------------<p>
<p>
	The header may take more than one line.  In any case, the end of the header
will filled to the end of the line (NS bytes).<p>
	To convert from DN to sigma0 (db) :<p>
<p>
	<b>db-value=-40.2 + 0.2 * DN</b>	<b></b><p>
<b></b>	<p>
	In db-byte files created by the SIR-C processor, a DN of 0 indicates filler
data (or sigma0's less than -40db).  However, from the precision data products
filler data can not be distinguished from sigma0's less than -40db.  Values
below -40db and above 10.8 db will be saturated.<p>
	If the radar was "right looking" the data will appear to be a mirror image of
the ground in the CEOS compressed data files.  Therefore, to avoid this
problem, if the radar is right-looking, the image is flipped left/right for the
db-byte files.<p>
	Most of the contents of the vicar label that are specific to the db-byte files
are self-explanatory.  The first dozen or so elements are required by the vicar
definition and define the size of the file, for instance the number of samples
(NS) and the number of lines (NL).  Here is an example vicar label to a db-byte
file:<p>

	It is an ASCII header, and may be displayed with the unix more command.  The
SIR-C processor sometimes created these db-byte files were created along with
precision data products.  However, due to technical reasons, the vicar label
created by db_byte_cr  has slightly differents contents than the one created by
the SIR-C processor.  The number of lines and samples is the same.<p>
<b>Appendix A. 5 Survey Format
<a name="RTFToC13">
Appendix A. 5 Survey Format 
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The survey data product is simply one channel of data (one polarization
channel of one frequency, usually L-band HH pol), low resolution (50 m pixel
spacing), in an unsigned 8 bit data format.  This data format is not calibrated
- the byte values can not be converted to sigma0 (db).<p>
	Each line is 2000 bytes long (ie. width is 2000 bytes).  The number of lines
(ie. height) is variable.   Each byte value represents the brightness, with 0
the lowest, and 255  the highest.  This is often called a "raw" data format.
<p>
	Along with image data, this data format includes annotation.  This annotation
is self-explanatory. <p>
	This data is available on cd-rom or over the World Wide Web at
http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/survey.html .<p>
<b>Appendix B:  Using Archive Tapes 
<a name="RTFToC14">Appendix
B: Using Archive Tapes 
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	When using SIR-C archive tapes, the ceos_reader software will not function.
Therefore, the program ceos_rd must be used.  Information on obtaining this
software is at http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software.html .<p>
	The archive tapes are not available for general distribution.  These archive
tapes are used for generating the CEOS tape which are used for general
distribution.  However, there may be some users that will find themselves with
an archive tape.  The tar tapes consist of the CEOS format files, but they are
not CEOS format tapes.<p>
	The archive tapes are unix tar format tapes.  Therefore, the first thing to do
is tar the three CEOS files per processing run number to your computer hard
disk.<p>
	Then, you should run the ceos_rd program.  This program should be executed as
follows :<p>
<p>
	&gt;ceos_rd XXXXX<p>
<p>
	where XXXXX is the processing run number.  The output will be several new
files, some of which will be :<p>
<p>
prXXXXX_img_ceos_image<p>
prXXXXX_img_ceos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_ldr_ceos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_radioplot_ZXY	(Z=wavelength band, XY = polarization - one for each
possible combination)	<p>
<p>
	Then, run the db_byte_cr program as described earlier in this manual.<p>
	If the data has been geocoded, then CEOS files are created for both the
geocoded and non-geocoded data.  By defaul t, the  ceos_rd program only decodes
the geocoded data, if both are on the disk.  the db-byte software in turn first
looks for non-geocoded data files decoded by the ceos_rd program, then for
geocoded products.  File names required for geocoded data products are:<p>
prXXXXX_img_geos_image<p>
prXXXXX_img_geos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_ldr_geos_ascii<p>
prXXXXX_radioplot_ZXY	(Z=wavelength band, XY = polarization- one for each
possible combination)	<p>
<p>
Follow the procedure below for creating db-byte files for geocoded data
products :<p>
<p>
<b>Procedure for Geocoded data products</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>1)  db-byte files for geocoded data only<p>
	- tar geos files to disk (<b>OK if ceos files also on disk</b>)<p>
	- run ceos_rd as above<p>
	- run db_byte_cr as above<p>
		*** geos db-byte files created<p>
2)  db-byte files for non-geocoded data only<p>
	- tar ceos files to disk (<b>geos files must not be present</b>!)<p>
	- run ceos_rd as above<p>
	- run db_byte_cr as above<p>
		*** ceos db-byte files created<p>
3) db-byte files for both  geocoded and non-geocoded data <p>
	- tar ceos and geos files to disk<p>
	- run ceos_rd program as above<p>
	- run db_byte program as above<p>
		*** geos db-byte files created<p>

The symmetrized Stokes matrix may be formed from the cross-products of the

<p>
	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* + 2ShvShv*) / 4.0<p>
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0<p>

<p>
	The cross-products in terms of the symmetrized Stokes matrix elements are :<p>
<p>
	ShhShh* = 2m(1,2) + 2m(1,1) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)<p>
	ShvShv* = m(3,3) + m(4,4)<p>
	SvvSvv* = 2m(1,1) - 2m(1,2) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)<p>
	ShhShv* = complex( m(1,3) + m(2,3), -m(1,4) - m(2, 4) )<p>
	ShhSvv* = complex(  m(3,3) - m(4,4), -2m(3,4) )<p>
	ShvSvv* = complex( m(1,3) - m(2,3), -m(1,4) + m(2,4) )<p>

	If you have received source code rather than an executable for your computer,
then the software must be compiled.  This software is written in standard
FORTRAN77.	<p>
	On most UNIX computers, the FORTRAN compiler is called 'F77'.  No options
should be necessary to compile the software described here, other than the file
names that follow these commands.<p>
	To link the main programs and generate the executable file, on UNIX computers
the 'f77' command performs this function also.<p>
	A makefile has been provided to compile the code.  In order to execute the
makefile, simply type make in the directory with the makefile and the source
code.  An executable will be created.<p>

<H1>Ground Measurements</H1>
<HR>
<P></P>
In order to calibrate the radar data, scietists and engineers 
 have deployed calibration
targets at sites around the world.  At Death Valley, California, we
placed <a href="../gif/Reflectr.gif"><strong>corner reflectors</strong>
<em> (108k)</em></a> and <a
href="../gif/LPARC.gif"><strong>transponders</strong><em> (72k)</em></a> 
on flat level areas near Stovepipe
Wells.</p>
<p>Corner reflectors have a known radar brightness.  Therefore, during
calibration of the data, we compare the measured brightness of the
corner reflector with the theoretical brightness to obtain the
calibration offset.  The radar data is then corrected by this factor.
The phase between polarizations, and the relative amplitudes, may be
similarly corrected.  A typical radar signature of a corner reflector
looks like <a href="../gif/Impulse.gif"><strong>this</strong> <em>(99k)</em></a>.</p>
<p>Transponders receive the radar  signal and amplify and retransmit it
back to the radar.  These devices may also be used during
calibration.</p>
<p>At Death Valley, a team also deployed <a href="../gif/RCVR.gif">
<strong>ground receivers and
transmitters</strong><em>(108k)</em></a>.  
These devices were used to measure the antenna gain
pattern and offsets between different channels in the along track
direction.  They will also be used during SRL-2 to measure attenuation
of the radar signal by rainforest canopies.</p>

<TITLE>Ground Measurements</TITLE>
<H1>Ground Measurements</H1>
<HR>
<P></P>
In order to calibrate the radar data, scietists and engineers 
 have deployed calibration
targets at sites around the world.  At Death Valley, California, we
placed <a href="../gif/Reflectr.gif"><strong>corner reflectors</strong>
<em> (108k)</em></a> and <a
href="../gif/LPARC.gif"><strong>transponders</strong><em> (72k)</em></a> 
on flat level areas near Stovepipe
Wells.</p>
<p>Corner reflectors have a known radar brightness.  Therefore, during
calibration of the data, we compare the measured brightness of the
corner reflector with the theoretical brightness to obtain the
calibration offset.  The radar data is then corrected by this factor.
The phase between polarizations, and the relative amplitudes, may be
similarly corrected.  A typical radar signature of a corner reflector
looks like <a href="../gif/Impulse.gif"><strong>this</strong> <em>(99k)</em></a>.</p>
<p>Transponders receive the radar  signal and amplify and retransmit it
back to the radar.  These devices may also be used during
calibration.</p>
<p>At Death Valley, a team also deployed <a href="../gif/RCVR.gif">
<strong>ground receivers and
transmitters</strong><em>(108k)</em></a>.  
These devices were used to measure the antenna gain
pattern and offsets between different channels in the along track
direction.  They will also be used during SRL-2 to measure attenuation
of the radar signal by rainforest canopies.</p>

Mission Objectives

     SIR-C/X-SAR, part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, is 
studying how our global environment is changing.  From the unique 
vantage point of space, the radar system will observe, monitor 
and assess large-scale environmental processes with a focus on 
climate change.  The spaceborne data, complemented by aircraft 
and ground studies, will give scientists highly detailed 
information that will help them distinguish natural environmental 
changes from those that are the result of human activity.  NASA 
will distribute the Mission to Planet Earth data to the 
international scientific community so that this essential 
research is available worldwide to people who are trying to make 
informed decisions about protecting their environment.


Why Radar?

     The unique feature of imaging radar is its ability to 
collect data over virtually any region at any time, regardless of 
weather or sunlight conditions.   Some radar waves can penetrate 
clouds, and under certain conditions, can also see through 
vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand.  In many cases, radar is 
the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of 
Earth's surface.

     Radar is a lowercase acronym for radio detection and 
ranging.  A synthetic aperture radar transmits pulses of 
microwave energy toward Earth and measures the strength and time 
delay of the energy that is scattered back to the antenna.  In 
the case of SIR-C/X-SAR, the motion of the shuttle is used to 
"synthesize" an antenna (the aperture) that is much longer in 
length than the actual antenna hardware.  A longer antenna 
produces images of finer resolution.

     Conditions on the Earth's surface influence how much radar 
energy is reflected  back to the antenna.  An area with a variety 
of surface types, such as hills, trees and large rocks, will 
generally reflect more energy back to the radar than a less 
complex area such as a desert.  The resulting radar image of the 
varied terrain will be brighter overall than the image of the 
simpler area.  The three frequencies of SIR-C/X-SAR will enable 
scientists to view three different scales of features in the 
images.

 
Results of STS-59 

     Launched April 9, 1994, SIR-C/X-SAR collected a total of 65 
hours of data during the 10 day mission, roughly corresponding to 
66 million square kilometers (26 million square miles).   All 
data were stored onboard the shuttle using a new generation of 
high-density, digital, rotary-head tape recorders.   The data 
filled 166 digital tape cartridges (similar to VCR tape 
cassettes).  Twenty-five of those tapes were filled with X-SAR 
data. 

     The mission returned 47 terabits of data (47 by 10^12 bits 
of data) or the equivalent of 30,000 encyclopedia volumes.   To 
think of it another way, each of the radars generates 45 million 
bits of data per second.  When all the radars are operating they 
produce 225 million bits of data per second, or the equivalent of 
45 simultaneously operating television stations.  The raw data 
was processed into images using JPL's digital SAR processor and 
by processors developed by Germany and Italy for the X-SAR data. 
  
     SIR-C data were downlinked, processed, and released to the 
science team via the Internet within 24 hours after launch.  X-
SAR data were processed in survey mode and displayed in real time 
on NASA Select Television.

     
Science

     The STS-59 mission achieved 100 percent of the SIR-C/X-SAR 
science objectives during the April 1994 flight.  In addition to 
taking high resolution data at all of the planned sites, the 
science team was able to adjust their timeline and observe events 
as they were happening on the ground.  SIR-C/X-SAR took data of 
the severe flooding that inundated the mid-western United States 
and Germany, as well as, three different views of tropical 
Cyclone Odille as it formed in the Pacific Ocean.   Scientists 
also acquired a series of radar images over Canada documenting 
the annual spring thaw of snow, ice and soil.

      Scientists are using SIR-C/X-SAR data to study how our 
global environment is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR radar data 
provides information about how many of Earth's complex "systems" 
-- those processes that control the movement of land, water, 
carbon and heat -- work together to make this a livable planet.  
The science team is particularly interested in studying the 
amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands 
areas, geologic features such as rock types and their 
distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind 
speed.   STS-68 will fly over the same sites that were studied by 
STS-59 so that scientists will be able to study any changes that 
may have occurred in those areas between the missions. 

     There are more than 400 sites on Earth where data will be 
taken during the mission.  Nineteen of those have been designated 
as "supersites," making them the highest priority targets and the 
focal point for many of the scientific investigators.  There are 
an additional 15 backup supersites.  If problems should occur 
during the flight that would drastically reduce the team's 
ability to collect data, the supersite data will take precedence 
over other data acquisition.    

     During STS-59 the scientists who were working in the Payload 
Operations Control Center in Houston were in daily communication 
with the researchers who were part of the "ground truth" teams.  
 The ground teams at several of the supersites made simultaneous 
measurements of vegetation, soil moisture, sea state, snow and 
weather conditions during the mission.  Data was also collected 
from aircraft and ships to ensure an accurate interpretation of 
the radar data taken from space.  In addition, the astronauts 
recorded their personal observations of weather and environmental 
conditions in coordination with SIR-C/X-SAR operations.


Supersites

     The supersites were chosen to represent different 
environments within each scientific discipline, and they are 
areas where intensive field work will occur before, during and 
after the flight.  
 
     Ecology

          Manaus, Brazil
          Raco, Michigan
          Duke Forest, North Carolina

     Ecologists study life on Earth and how different species of 
animals and plants interact with one another and their local 
environment. SIR-C/X-SAR ecology investigations are focused on 
mapping wetlands, deforestation and flooding under forest 
canopies over the tropical forests of the Amazon basin in South 
America and over the temperate forests of North America and 
Central Europe.  Scientists are also studying wetlands and are 
using the data to validate computer models to determine 
vegetation type, seasonal freeze/thaw transitions, and biomass.  
The radar images will be used to study land use, the volume, 
types and extent of vegetation and the effects of fires, floods 
and clear-cutting.

     Using early-release data, science team members have already 
generated both tree classification and vegetation biomass maps of 
the Raco, Michigan site and a 
freeze/thaw map over the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan backup 
supersite.  A map of flooding near Manaus, Brazil has also been 
produced, as the first step toward improving models of both 
flooding and wetlands under dense forest canopies.

     SIR-C/X-SAR's three radar frequencies interact with the 
vegetation on different scales, providing three independent views 
of the forest.  The radar's multi-polarization ability allows 
scientists to look beneath the thick vegetation canopy of the 
forest in these often cloud-covered regions of the world to study 
the trunks of the trees, which reflect the vertical waves as well 
as the tree branches, which reflect the horizontal waves.  These 
data give scientists a more complete picture of the conditions on 
the ground.

     Seasonal changes in the forest will be studied by comparing 
data from the two SIR-C/X-SAR flights in April and October.  For 
example, data from two previous imaging radar missions showed a 
decrease in the amount of forests along the Mississippi River 
between 1978 and 1981.  Deforestation threatens both temperate 
and tropical forests around the world.  SIR-C/X-SAR data will be 
used along with ground data to understand the impact of the loss 
of forests on local populations of plants and animals.  By 
studying the short-term and long-term changes in forests, 
scientists can determine what effects changing environmental 
conditions and land use have on the forests and, in turn, on 
global climate change.

     Hydrology

          Chickasha, Oklahoma
          Otztal, Austria
          Bebedouro, Brazil
          Montespertoli, Italy

     Hydrologist study how water flows on land.  In addition to 
swamps, lakes, rivers, snow and ice, an important part of the 
global water cycle is the large amounts of water stored as soil 
moisture and in vegetation.  This "hidden" water plays a major 
role in determining whether a region is wet or dry, and it also 
influences the way energy is distributed around the globe.  

     SIR-C/X-SAR hydrology investigations are focused on Brazil, 
Italy and Oklahoma, where the radar data will be used to 
determine soil moisture patterns.  These studies will help 
scientists develop ways to estimate soil moisture and evaporation 
rates over large areas, which will ultimately be incorporated 
into computer models to help predict a region's water cycle.  
Eventually, continuous radar monitoring of an area's water 
resources would help farmers determine the best type of crops to 
plant, where to plant them and when.

     Another significant part of hydrology is snow cover.  Using 
data from STS-59, investigators generated a snow and ice 
classification map over the Oetztal, Austria supersite and a snow 
wetness map of the Mammoth Mountain, Calif. backup supersite. 
Spring snow melt often determines the annual runoff cycle and the 
resulting water supply, ground water and reservoir replenishment 
rates.  For many areas, long-term or ground-based snow cover data 
do not exist, and radar data is the only way to collect this 
information.   SIR-C/X-SAR acquired snow cover data over Mammoth 
Lakes, Calif., the Austrian Alps and northwest China.  The 
shorter wavelength X-band data is useful to scientists for 
determining snow type, while the longer wavelengths of L-band and 
C-band helps them estimate snow volume.   These data will help 
communities determine how much water will be available for human 
and agriculture use.   In October, the emphasis will shift to the 
Patagonian district in Southern Chile, which contains the largest 
modern glaciers and ice fields in South America.

     Wetlands are often highly desirable places for humans to 
live and work, and  they are also home to delicate ecosystems 
that are especially vulnerable to changes introduced by humans.  
Wetlands are the source of many trace gases that play an 
important part in the global atmospheric cycle.  SIR-C/X-SAR will 
be able to determine the extent and limits of selected wetlands 
areas because radar is extremely sensitive to the presence of 
standing water, even under vegetation cover.  Data from the 
multiple flights of SIR-C/X-SAR will help scientists monitor how 
the wetlands conditions are changing.

     Oceanography

          The Gulf Stream (mid-Atlantic region)
          East-North Atlantic Ocean
          Southern Ocean

     Oceanographers study how waves move through the ocean and 
how the air and sea interact.  The ocean is a reservoir for heat 
and energy, and the air-sea interaction moves this heat and 
energy around the globe regulating the Earth's climate.  The Gulf 
Stream off the East Coast of North America is a major ocean 
current that transports heat from the equator toward the poles.

     The relatively low altitude of the shuttle is particularly 
advantageous for oceanography investigations since the SIR-C/X-
SAR radars are more sensitive to ocean features than satellites 
in higher orbits. Oceanographers are using data from SIR-C/X-SAR 
to study surface and internal waves and wave/current nteractions. 
In addition, extensive wave energy information was collected over 
the Southern Ocean by an associated experiment provided by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. These data will help 
scientists study how the Earth's climate is moderated by the 
ocean.       

     Geology

          Galapagos Islands
          Sahara Desert
          Death Valley, Calif.
          Andes Mountains, Chile

     Geologists study the present surface of the Earth.  By 
observing older rocks they can determine how an area came to be 
and what it may have looked liked in the past.  SIR-C/X-SAR is 
mapping geologic structures and variations in rock types over 
large areas, as well as areas of volcanic activity and erosion.  
These data are especially useful in areas of heavy vegetation and 
continuous cloud cover, where field work is often difficult.  

     The longer L-band radar wavelength are particularly useful 
for looking beneath surfaces.  SIR-C/X-SAR obtained penetration 
data of the Sahara desert that show braided channels beneath an 
old river valley.  On the ground and in optical photographs, this 
big valley and the channels in it are invisible because they are 
entirely covered by windblown sand.  Some of these same channels 
were observed in SIR-A images in 1981.  It is hypothesized that 
the large valley was carved by one of several ancient predecessor 
rivers that crossed this part of North Africa, flowing westward, 
tens of millions of years before the Nile River existed.  The 
Nile flows north about 300 kilometers (200 miles) to the east of 
the area observed by the radar.

     The existence of hidden river channels indicates that 
portions of the Sahara have undergone significant climate change 
and have evolved from an area of flowing streams to what is now 
an arid desert.  SIR-C/X-SAR is also studying other geologic 
features that record past climate changes.  In areas of Death 
Valley, Calif., western China and the Patagonia region of the 
southern Andes, the radar mapped alluvial fans.  Alluvial fans 
are gravel deposits that wash down from the mountains.  They are 
found throughout the semi-arid deserts of the world in areas 
where there is a significant amount of tectonic activity.  The 
gravel builds up at the base of the mountains during periods of 
overall wetter climate.  The radar is sensitive to these rocky 
and rough surfaces that allows scientists to study the history of 
past climate and the relative age of surfaces.  As an area ages, 
it is exposed to weathering.  This changes its roughness 
characteristics.   Mapping areas of past climate change will give 
scientists a stronger base from which to monitor and predict 
future climate changes.     

     During STS-59, SIR-C/X-SAR took radar images of several 
volcanoes, including Mt. Pinatubo and the volcanoes of the 
Galapagos Islands.  These radar images are helping scientists 
identify the different types of lava flows and their ages.  A key 
objective of STS-68 will be to obtain a second image of Mt. 
Pinatubo during the summer monsoon season that is likely to 
produce new mudflows and to evaluate whatever short-term changes 
may have occurred.

     Calibration

          Flevoland, The Netherlands
          Kerang, Australia
          Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany
          Western Pacific Ocean
     
     Ground equipment consisting of calibration devices called 
corner reflectors and receivers were deployed in southern 
Germany, The Netherlands, Australia and Death Valley, Calif. to 
measure the amount of radar energy obtained at the ground during 
the flight.  This information is being used calibrate the radar 
data.

     Rain Experiment

     Data were also taken during STS-59 to support the two SIR-
C/X-SAR experiments designed to image rain.  These experiments 
took place over the Western Pacific Ocean, an area scientists 
call the "rainiest place on Earth."  

     Although radar can penetrate clouds, it is important to 
understand how rain can change conditions on the ground and thus 
change the radar image.  At the shorter wavelengths of X-band and 
C-band, rain may reduce the strength of the radar or scatter the 
signals significantly.  

     The rain experiments offer a unique challenge to the 
operation of the radar during flight.  All the other experiments 
can be reasonably tied to a specific area, while the rain 
experiments only require that a "deep" rainstorm be in progress. 
 Weather targets are transitory in both space and time and cannot 
be scheduled, so finding a good target of opportunity is a 
gamble.  Scientists chose the western Pacific because there is a 
high probability that it will be raining there when the shuttle 
passes over it.   


Interferometry -- A New Technology

     One of the bonuses of flying SIR-C/X-SAR for a second time, 
is the opportunity to demonstrate a new technology from the 
shuttle platform, called interferometry.   Scientists will 
conduct the experiment during the last three days of the flight 
using subsequent passes of SIR-C/X-SAR over the same areas on the 
Earth.   Investigators hope it will be possible to generate 
digital elevation models (topography) of the Earth's surface if 
the shuttle orbit can be repeated with sufficient precision. Once 
topography is determined, a third interferometric pass can be 
used to determine what, if any, topographic change has occurred 
in the intervening time between radar overpasses.  This 
demonstration will be carried out in preparation for TOPSAT, a 
mission planned for later this decade to measure global 
topography and centimeter-scale topographic change using laser 
and radar Interferometry.  The focus of these experiments is to 
improve our assessments of natural hazards such as  flooding, 
subsidence, mudflows and volcanic eruptions.   For example, the 
topography of mountain glaciers is important because it directly 
reflects ice-flow dynamics and is closely linked to global 
climate and sea level change.  Monitoring mountain glaciers on a 
global basis will give scientists important information on the 
rate of global warming.   In addition, topographic data can also 
be used to reduce the risk of natural disasters by monitoring 
lava flows, flooding and earthquake faults.


Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR)

     The main payload for the STS-68 Space Radar Laboratory is 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(SIR-C/X-SAR), a sophisticated set of radars that fills nearly 
all of Endeavour's cargo bay.  This is the second flight for SIR-
C/X-SAR.  The first flight took place in April 1994.       

     SIR-C, built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ball 
Communications Systems Division for NASA, is a two-frequency 
radar including L-band (23-cm wavelength) and C-band (6-cm 
wavelength).  SIR-C is the first spaceborne radar with the 
ability to transmit and receive horizontally and vertically 
polarized waves at both frequencies.   The multi-frequency, 
multi-polarization capability creates a new and more powerful 
tool for studying the world.  A good way to understand this is to 
think of visual images:  Color pictures have more information 
about a subject than do black and white pictures, just like 
multi-frequency, multi-polarization radar images contain more 
information about the surface than single frequency, single 
polarization radar images.

     The SIR-C antenna is the most massive piece of flight 
hardware ever built at JPL.  Its mass is 10,500 kg (23,100 lbs) 
and it measures 12 meters by 4 meters (39.4 feet by 13.1 feet).  
The instrument is composed of several subsystems:  the antenna 
array, the transmitter, the receivers, the data-handling 
subsystem and the ground processor.  The antenna consists of 
three leaves, and each is divided into four subpanels.  

     Unlike previous SIR missions, the SIR-C radar beam is formed 
from hundreds of small transmitters embedded in the surface of 
the radar antenna.  By properly adjusting the energy from these 
transmitters, the beam can be electronically steered without 
physically moving the large radar antenna.  This feature, 
combined with the roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle, will 
allow images to be acquired from 15-to 55- degree angles of 
incidence.   Advancements in radar technology will allow SIR-C to 
acquire simultaneous images at L-band and C-band frequencies with 
HH, VV, HV, and VH polarizations.    

    Polarization describes how the radar wave travels in space.  
For example, when data is acquired with HH polarization, the wave 
is transmitted from the antenna in the horizontal plane and the 
antenna receives the backscattered radiation in the
horizontal plane.  With HV polarization, the wave is transmitted 
horizontally, but is received by the antenna in the vertical 
plane.  It is the interaction between the transmitted waves and 
the Earth's surface that determines the polarization of the waves 
received by the antenna.  Multi-polarization data contain more 
specific information about surface conditions than single 
polarization data.  Multi-polarization data are particularly 
useful to scientists studying vegetation because the data allow 
them to see different types of crops and to measure the volume of 
trees contained under the canopy of a forest. 

     X-SAR is built by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies 
for the German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer 
Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian space agency, 
Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).  It is a single-polarization 
radar operating at X-band (3-cm wavelength).
      
     X-SAR uses a slotted-waveguide antenna, which is finely 
tuned to produce a narrow, pencil-thin beam of energy.  The X-SAR 
antenna is mounted on a supporting structure that is tilted 
mechanically to align the X-band beam with the L-band and C-band 
beams.  X-SAR will provide VV polarization images.

     Both SIR-C and X-SAR can be operated as either stand-alone 
radars or in conjunction with each other.  The width of the 
ground swath varies from 15 to 90 kilometers (9 to 56 miles), 
depending on the orientation of the antenna beams.  The
resolution of the radars can be varied from 10 to 200 meters (33 
to 656 feet.)  


Previous Radar Missions

     Since the late 1970s a variety of NASA satellite missions 
have used imaging radar to study Earth and our planetary 
neighbors.  Perhaps the most familiar example of NASA's success 
using imaging radar is the Magellan mission to Venus.  Magellan's 
radar pierced the dense clouds covering Venus to map the entire 
surface of the planet, revealing a world that had been hidden to 
humans for centuries.

     SIR-C is the latest in a series of Earth observing imaging 
radar missions that began in June 1978 with the launch of Seasat 
SAR and continued with SIR-A in November 1981 and with SIR-B in 
October 1984.  Both the SIR-A and SIR-B sensors were derived from 
the Seasat SAR, and all three were capable of transmitting and
receiving horizontally polarized radiation at L-band frequency.

     The major difference between the Seasat and SIR-A sensors 
was the orientation of the radar's antenna with respect to 
Earth's surface.  Microwave radiation transmitted by Seasat 
struck the surface at a fixed angle of approximately 23 degrees 
from the local zenith direction.  SIR-A was designed to view the 
surface at a fixed 50 degree angle.  

     SIR-B improved upon both those missions because its antenna 
could be mechanically tilted.  This allowed SIR-B to obtain 
multiple radar images of a given target at different angles 
during successive shuttle orbits.  

     The X-SAR antenna is a follow-on to Germany's Microwave 
Remote Sensing Experiment (MRSE), which was flown aboard the 
first shuttle Spacelab mission in 1983.  
     These early missions had a tremendous impact on the 
international remote sensing community when SIR-A discovered 
ancient river beds hidden beneath the sands of the Sahara, and 
SIR-B data led explorers to the Lost City of Ubar in Oman.


Data Acquisition Plans for  STS-68

     Portions of data will be downlinked to the ground in near-
real time via NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System 
(TDRSS).   However, only one channel of data can be downlinked or 
played back at a time.  This is not a problem for X-SAR since it 
only has one channel of data.   SIR-C has up to four channels of 
data, and each channel must be played back separately.

     Historically, processing SAR data has required a great deal 
of computer time on special-purpose computer systems.  
SIR-C/X-SAR scientists will benefit, however, from rapid advances 
in computer technology that make it possible to process the 
images with a standard parallel super computer.   Yet even with 
these advances, it will still take five months to produce survey 
images from the large volume of data acquired.  Detailed 
processing will take another nine months to complete.  Data will 
be exchanged among Italy, Germany and the United States to meet 
the needs of the science investigators.

     NASA/JPL will attempt to release some radar images to the 
press during the shuttle flight.  The images will be processed at 
JPL and sent electronically via Internet to the Johnson Space 
Center, where the image will be released on NASA Select 
Television.  Hard copy prints will be released simultaneously to 
the wire services at JPL.   


Science Team

     An international team of 49 science investigators and three 
associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments.  Thirteen 
nations are represented, including:  Australia, Austria, Brazil, 
Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, 
Saudi Arabia and the United States.

     Dr. Diane Evans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the U.S. 
project scientist.  Dr. Herwig Ottl of DLR is the German project 
scientist and Prof. Mario Calamia of the University of Florence 
is the Italian project scientist.


Management

     The SIR-C mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory for NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth.  Michael 
Sander is the JPL project manager.

     X-SAR is managed by the Joint Project Office (JPO) located 
near Bonn, Germany.  Rolf Werninghaus of DARA is the project 
manager and Dr. Paolo Ammendola of ASI is the deputy project 
manager.

This record stores the 4x4 polarimetric calibration matrix and the absolute
calibration coefficient..  The functions include channel balancing, phase
calibration, and cross-talk removal.  Whenever the polarimetric calibration
function has not been performed, as in the case of single pol data, the
calibration matrix is the identity matrix.<p>

	For SIR-C  there are three possible data formats:

		1) compressed cross-products data (MLC)  (Multilook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
		 	 dual-pol 5 bytes per pixel 

		2) compressed detected data (MLD)  (Multilook data)
			 single-pol, 2 bytes per pixel

		3) compressed scattering matrix data (SLC)  (Singlelook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
			 dual-pol, 6 bytes per pixel
			 single-pol, 4 bytes per pixel 

	In the following descriptions:
	
		sign( ) will return the sign of the argument (  1) 

		nint( ) will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument.  

		int( ) will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value is less than zero, 
subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN 
int( ).



Single Look Complex data


	There are three data products for complex scattering matrix data, depending of 
polarization mode.


	SIR-C "SLC" quad-pol data - 10 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader.   The standard output 
product by the GDPS will not have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each 
line.  There will be separate header files.  This data will be single look complex scattering 
matrix data.  This is the only format that is supported by the SIR-C calibration processor 
during phase 1.  There is no symmetrization of the data.  There is no general scale factor.

 10 bytes per pixel - quad-pol data, with:
	 Byte(1) :  int{log2 (SHHSHH* + SHVSHV* + SVHSVH*+ SVVSVV*)}
	 Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}

		Mantissa =  (SHHSHH* + SHVSHV* + SVHSVH*+ SVVSVV*) / 
2Byte(1)
		qsca =  sqrt{ [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1) }

	 Byte(3) : nint{127 Re(SHH)/qsca}
	 Byte(4) : nint{127 Im(SHH)/qsca}
 	 Byte(5) : nint{127 Re(SHV)/qsca}
	 Byte(6) : nint{127 Im(SHV)/qsca}
	 Byte(7) : nint{127 Re(SVH)/qsca}
	 Byte(8) : nint{127 Im(SVH)/qsca}
	 Byte(9) : nint{127 Re(SVV)/qsca}
	 Byte(10) : nint{127 Im(SVV)/qsca}

	 The total power (when  decompressing) is :

		TP =  0.25 ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2Byte(1)) 

	and the remaining terms are given by :

		ysca =  sqrt{ [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1) }

		Re(SHH) = byte(3) ysca/127
		Im(SHH) = byte(4) ysca/127
		Re(SHV) = byte(5) ysca/127
		Im(SHV) = byte(6) ysca/127
		Re(SVH) = byte(7) ysca/127
		Im(SVH) = byte(8) ysca/127
		Re(SVV) = byte(9) ysca/127
		Im(SVV) = byte(10) ysca/127


	SIR-C "SLC" dual-pol data - 6 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader. The standard output 
product by the GDPS will not have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each 
line.  There will be separate header files.  This data will be single look complex scattering 
matrix data.  The compression format is the same as for the quad-pol data format, except 
that not all 10 bytes are present.  The bytes present depend on the polarization mode.
	HH and VV polarizations : bytes 1,2,3,4,9,10
	HH and HV polarizations : bytes 1,2,3,4,5,6
	VH and VV polarizations : bytes 1,2,7,8,9,10

	SIR-C "SLC" single-pol data - 4 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader. The standard output 
product by the GDPS will have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each line.  
There will be separate header files.  This data will be single look complex scattering 
matrix data.  The compression format is the same as for the quad-pol data format, except 
that not all 10 bytes are present.  The bytes present depend on the polarization mode.

	HH polarization : bytes 1,2,3,4
	VV polarization : bytes 1,2,9,10

This image shows Death Valley, California, centered at 36.
degrees north latitude, 117. degrees west longitude.  The radar
frequency used in obtaining this image is 1.2 Ghz (L-band).The
image shows 
the sand dunes near Stove Pipe Wells at the
center.  
This SIR-C/X-SAR supersite is an area of extensive field
investigations and has been visited by both Space Radar Lab
astronaut crews.  Elevations in the valley range from 70 meters
(230 feet) below sea level, the lowest in the United States, to
more than 3,300 meters (10,800 feet) above sea level.  Scientists
are using SIR-C/X-SAR data from Death Valley to help answer a
number of different questions about Earth's geology.  One
question concerns how alluvial fans are formed and change through
time under the influence of climatic changes and earthquakes. 
Alluvial fans are gravel deposits that wash down from the
mountains over time.  They are visible in the image as circular,
fan-shaped bright areas extending into the darker valley floor
from the mountains.  Information about the alluvial fans helps
scientists study Earth's ancient climate.  Scientists know the
fans are built up through climatic and tectonic processes and
they will use the SIR-C/X-SAR data to understand the nature and
rates of weathering processes on the fans, soil formation and the
transport of sand and dust by the wind.  SIR-C/X-SAR's
sensitivity to centimeter-scale (inch-scale) roughness provides
detailed maps of surface texture.  Such information can be used
to study the occurrence and movement of dust storms and sand
dunes.  The goal of these studies is to gain a better
understanding of the record of past climatic changes and the
effects of those changes on a sensitive environment.  This may
lead to a better ability to predict future response of the land
to different potential global climate-change scenarios.
</p>
<P>
Death Valley is also one of the primary calibration sites for
SIR-C/X-SAR.  The bright dots near the center of the image are
corner reflectors that have been set-up to calibrate the radar as
the shuttle passes overhead.  Thirty triangular-shaped reflectors
(they look like aluminum pyramids) have been deployed by the
calibration team from JPL over a 40- by 40-kilometer (25- by 25-
mile) area in and around Death Valley.   The calibration team
will also deploy transponders (electronic reflectors) and
receivers to measure the radar signals from SIR- C/X-SAR on the
ground.

SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.  The
radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed
observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight
conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths:  L-
band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm).  The multi-
frequency data will be used by the international scientific
community to better understand the global environment and how it
is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and
ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those
environmental changes which are caused by nature and those
changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed
by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  X-SAR was developed by the
Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the German space agency,
Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the
Italian space agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

AIRSAR Data Compression Formats


	For AIRSAR data, there are four possible formats :  

		1) compressed stokes matrix data 
			(multilook,quad-pol, low-res, 10 bytes/pixel)
		2) compressed scattering matrix (730 processor) data 
			(single look,quad-pol,10 bytes/pixel)
		3) compressed scattering matrix (3.5 processor) data 
			(single look,quad-pol, low-res, 10 bytes/pixel)
		4) uncompressed synoptic amplitude data 
			(vax real*4, single pol, low-res, 4 bytes/pixel)
	In the following descriptions:
	
		sign( ) will return the sign of the argument (  1) 

		nint( ) will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument.  

		int( ) will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value is less than zero, 
subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN 
int( ).

		gen_fac is the AIRSAR general scale factor whose value is recorded in the 
header of the oldheader, field 133.




Stokes matrix data

	AIRSAR compressed Stokes matrix "CM" quad-pol data - 10 bytes per pixel.   
Consists of one file for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of each file consists of 1024 
azimuth samples.  There are 750 or 1282 lines depending on the processor, each 
corresponding to progressively greater range from the radar.  The azimuth pixel spacing 
is 12.1 meters for the pre-1993 prf, and 8 meters for the 1993 and later prf.  The range 
pixel spacing is 6.66 meters (assumes 20 MHz data).  The first two or three lines in the 
file are header lines.  The data has been symmetrized such that SHV = 0.5 (SHV +SVH), 
and is usually calibrated.  For the "730 processor", the data has been multilooked by 4, 
while for the "3.5 processor", the data has been multilooked by 16.  

 10 bytes per pixel - quad-pol data, with:
	 Byte(1) :  int{log2(M11)}
	 Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}
		Mantissa = (M11) / 2Byte(1))
		qsca = gen_fac [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1)
	 Byte(3) : nint{127 M12/qsca}
	 Byte(4) : nint{127 sign(M13/qsca) sqrt(M13/qsca)}
	 Byte(5) : nint{127 sign(M14/qsca) sqrt(M14/qsca)}
	 Byte(6) : nint{127 sign(M23/qsca) sqrt(M23/qsca)}
	 Byte(7) : nint{127 sign(M24/qsca) sqrt(M24/qsca)}
	 Byte(8) : nint{127 M33/qsca}
	 Byte(9) : nint{127 M34/qsca}
	 Byte(10) : nint{127 M44/qsca}
	The total power is :
		TP = M11 = gen_fac ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2Byte(1)) 
	The remaining terms are given by :

		M12 = M11 byte(3) /127
		M13 = sign(byte(4)) M11 (byte(4) /127)**2
		M14 = sign(byte(5)) M11 (byte(5) /127)**2
		M23 = sign(byte(6)) M11 (byte(6) /127)**2
		M24 = sign(byte(7)) M11 (byte(7) /127)**2
		M33 = M11 byte(8) /127
		M34 = M11 byte(9) /127
		M44 = M11 byte(10) /127
		M22 = M11 - M33 - M44

	The difference between the AIRSAR 'CM' data and SIR-C MLC data is chiefly 
that, for AIRSAR, the elements of the Stokes Matrix are stored directly to each 
compressed byte;  while for SIR-C, the cross-products (that when combined appropriately 
comprise the Stokes matrix) are stored.  In addition, the AIRSAR data employs a general 
scale factor, while SIR-C does not.  And finally, the value stored in the first two bytes by 
AIRSAR is the total power divided by the general scale factor, while the value stored in 
the first two bytes by SIR-C is four times the total power.



The Stokes matrix and Cross-Products

The symmetrized Stokes matrix may be formed from the cross-products of the scattering 
matrix that are stored by SIR-C in the MLC format as follows:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* + 2ShvShv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = m(1,2)
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* +SvvSvv* - 2ShvShv* ) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(ShvSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = m(1,3)
	m(3,2) = m(2,3)
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(3,4) = -Im(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(4,1) = m(1,4)
	m(4,2) = m(2,4)
	m(4,3) = m(3,4)
	m(4,4) = (ShvShv* - Re(ShhSvv*) )/ 2.0

	The cross-products in terms of the symmetrized Stokes matrix elements are :

	ShhShh* = 2m(1,2) + 2m(1,1) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShvShv* = m(3,3) + m(4,4)
	SvvSvv* = 2m(1,1) - 2m(1,2) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShhShv* = complex( m(1,3) + m(2,3), -m(1,4) - m(2, 4) )
	ShhSvv* = complex(  m(3,3) - m(4,4), -2m(3,4) )
	ShvSvv* = complex( m(1,3) - m(2,3), -m(1,4) + m(2,4) )
 

	For SLC data, the Stokes matrix will not be symmetrized.  The unsymmetrized 
Stokes Matrix is given by:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* + SvhSvh* + SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - ShvShv* + SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* - SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* - ShvShv* - SvhSvh*) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(SvhSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = (Re(ShhSvh*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,2) = ( Re(ShhSvh*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0

RAVENV 2.0 has been expanded in scope, allowing for many types of images to beexamined and providing a more versatile means of extracting vital informationfrom the image data sets.  RAVEN was created using the IDL environment, whichallows for a relatively easy means of developing applications for visualizingdatasets in an interactive, window-based environment.<p><p>The <i>cube</i> is the basic image file used by RAVEN.  It is essentially abuilding block of images arranged in <i>band sequential </i>(BSQ) order, toppedby a header.  Originally, the cube file was intended to hold only AIRSAR imagesand  was capable of containing information from just one bandset.  Thecapability of RAVEN has increased since its changes began from the Version 1.0prototype and the cube file now has the potential of containing many bandsetsfrom many different sources such as SIR-C, SPOT, and synthesized byte images.<p><p>Images can now be arranged in many different ways, to reflect research acrossdifferent frequency bands, different points in time, and differentpolarizations and relationships relating to the same site.  This versatilitycomes about through the new scheme of <i>editing</i> the cube to create theneeded arrangement of images and new ways of displaying and viewing imagedata.<p><p>The new RAVEN now keeps all images in memory for fast transition from one imageto the next, and allows for a <i>new</i> form of visualization across images:simultaneous zoom.  This allows for multiple zoom windows, each showing ablow-up of a different image, to be shown on the screen at the same time.  Thewindows are slaved together so that they all point to the same location withthe same magnification.  The benefits of having the images in memory may extendbeyond what is already provided in the current version of RAVEN.<p><p><b>0.1:  What's in RAVEN v 2.0</b><p><b></b><p>* Reads AIRSAR, SIR-C, or byte data<p>* Cube building and editing<p>* Memory calculator that tells how big a cube can be given the memory in yoursystem and the size of the area you want to look at.<p>* Synthesizes AIRSAR and SIR-C data files<p>* Reads and processes byte files<p>* Image display<p>* Color slicing by dn, dB, phase, correlation coefficient<p>* Contrast Enhancement<p>* Multiple zoom windows<p>* RGB color:  24-bit true color or 8-bit pseudo color<p>* Computes statistics for a region of interest (mean, standard deviation,kurtosis as well as the average incidence angle and wavelength).

Section1.1 will explain how to get RAVEN set up on your account and how to execute it.This should require only a small amount of preparation on your part.<p><p><b>1.0:  Key Terms</b><p><b></b><p>There are frequent references in this manual made to things such as<i>cubes</i>, <i>source files</i>, <i>widgets</i>, <i>headers</i>, and<i>images</i>.  Since it is essential for you to understand these concepts tolearn and use RAVEN, their definitions are presented here.<p><p>What's an Image??<p><p>An <i>image</i>, at least in the case of RAVEN, is a two-dimensional array ofbyte data, providing one byte for each pixel, signaling a grey value intensityfrom zero to 255.  The two dimensions are arranged by <i>samples</i> and<i>lines</i>, which is known as the <i>raster format</i>.  What results is asquare picture, showing visually what is seen by the remote sensor.  Images cancome from many sources, whether it be microwave sensors, infra-red sensors,visible-band cameras, or radar sensors.  Ultimately, an image is like apicture, displaying spatial relationships between points of data.<p><p>What's a Header??<p><p>A <i>header</i> is a string of characters in an image file that lists keyparameters relating to an image or group of images.  It allows the user or aprogram to adjust their settings to accommodate the image(s).  The RAVEN cubeuses a header which gives information on the cube itself and on each of theimages that the cube contains.<p><p>What's a Cube??<p><p>A <i>cube</i> is simply a byte file, albeit a fairly large one in manyinstances, which contains a collection of related images.  The images arerelated in that they are coregistered to each other and refer to the samespatial location.  The user must see to it that the source files to be used forthe cube are coregistered beforehand.  RAVEN does not perform image warping orcoregistration.  <p><p>The cube starts off with a header, which is of a predefined size, containingcharacter string data relating to cube properties and the attributes of eachimage in the cube.  What follows is a sequential ordering of byte images,listing the data for one complete image before starting with the next.  Thecube is loaded into memory as one large package when RAVEN starts up the mainimage viewing functions.  From there, the user can select individual imagesfrom the cube for viewing, with polarimetric data being back referenced to therelated source file on disk when necessary. <p><p>What's a Source File??<p><p>A <i>source file</i> is the data file from which the byte images are generatedand can take many forms.  For instance, AIRSAR images come from a source filethat has a 30,000 byte header and represents data for each pixel by a 10 bytecompressed Stokes matrix.  Source files used by RAVEN are identified by theirfilenames.  The type that the source file is (i.e. AIRSAR, SIR-C, byte, etc.)is known by the four letter tag added to the filename.  Most images in the cubehave a source file that they reference.  The source file that each image pointsto is listed in the header of the cube.<p><p>What's a Widget??<p><p>A <i>widget</i> is a graphical object which appears on the screen and performsa specific function for the user.  There are many types of widgets that aperson may have at their disposal when running a widget-driven application.Some display images and plots, some allow for text entry, and others arebuttons that can be pushed to activate a process.  In all, a widget provides anew, more tactile method of performing tasks in an application, removing theneed of memorizing text command sets.<p><p><p><b>1.1:  Setting Up RAVEN</b><p><b></b><p>	There are a few items that need to be set up before you can begin using RAVEN.These items are described below.<p><p>1.1-0  You Need IDL<p><p>	RAVEN runs in IDL (Interactive Data Language, from Research Systems, Inc.) andthis environment must be properly installed on the machine before trying to runRAVEN.  RAVEN requires IDL v. 3.5. <p><p>1.1-1  RAVEN Startup Commands<p><p>	You <b>must</b> add four environment variables to your .cshrc file, namelyRAVEN_DIR, RAVEN_SOURCE_DIR, RAVEN_CUBE_DIR, and RAVEN_DAT_DIR.  Here's adescription of what you need: <p><p>	<tt>RAVEN_DIR </tt>is an environment variable that points to the location ofthe RAVEN executable.  Whenever you run RAVEN, this is the directory it looksfor.  It needs to point to the directory that contains the file raven.idl.<p><p>	<tt>RAVEN_SOURCE_DIR </tt>points to the directory where the source code is.This is merely placed there for the convenience of RAVEN developers and thosemaintaining RAVEN.<p><p>	<tt>RAVEN_CUBE_DIR </tt>tells RAVEN the default directory of the cube files.In this particular case, the variable is meant for the convenience of the userand also gives RAVEN a first hint of where to look for cube files.<p><p>	<tt>RAVEN_DAT_DIR </tt>points to the location of the source files that a RAVENsession must reference.  <b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The default directory shown by thisvariable must contain ALL of the source files for the cube that you intend torun.  RAVEN looks to this directory ONLY.  <p><p>Type this set of commands (with the appropriate modifications for your needs)at some point after any IDL related settings in the file:<p><p><tt>	#...for RAVEN</tt><p><tt>	setenv RAVEN_DIR <i>/usr/local/raven/Raven_idl</i></tt><p><tt> 	setenv RAVEN_SOURCE_DIR <i>/usr/local/raven/Raven_source</i></tt><p><tt>	setenv RAVEN_CUBE_DIR <i>/data/raven_cube</i></tt><p><tt>	setenv RAVEN_DAT_DIR <i>/data/raven_data</i></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	#...raven startup from the shell</tt><p><tt>	alias raven "idl $RAVEN_DIR/raven.startup"</tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt></tt>This should be sufficient information to get RAVEN running properly.<p><p>Again, remember that the directories shown above are examples and may notactually be the correct directories for your system.  Also note that you arefree to change the variables RAVEN_CUBE_DIR and RAVEN_DAT_DIR to suit yourneeds.  Have them point to directories where you will be placing source filesand cube files (you can also point them to the same directory).<p><p>As a final note, be sure that you save the changes that you made to your .cshrcfile.  To have these changes take effect immediately, you can do one of twothings:  <b>a)</b> you can re-run of the .cshrc commands by typing<tt> source.cshrc </tt>at the shell prompt, or <b>b)</b> you can log out completely fromthe system and log in again, thus causing the new .cshrc to be executed.Either way should give you the same results.<p><p>You are now ready to run RAVEN and can simply do so by typing<tt> raven </tt>atthe shell prompt (do not enter IDL and then run raven - this causes raven todrop out).<p><p>1.1-2  Preparing Source Files<p><p><b>Files that will be used by RAVEN must follow a specific syntax</b>.  Here isan example source filename of an AIRSAR C-band Stokes matrix file:<p><p><tt>cm3217.airc</tt><p><tt></tt><p>The portion of the filename before the dot (".") is the <i>name</i> and theportion after the dot is the <i>tag</i>.  For best results, in terms oflegibility when running RAVEN, the name should not be longer than eightcharacters, using some shorthand code to uniquely identify the file.  The tagwill always be four characters.  The tag is important in that it identifies the<i>type</i> of source file that it is.  RAVEN, knowing the type of file, canthen process the data correctly.  If RAVEN does not recognize the tag, it willlabel it as UNKNOWN and will not be able to process it.<p><p>It will be your responsibility to ensure that the proper tags are placed onyour source files.  A preliminary list of tags are placed here.  Note that onlythe AIRSAR tags are currently used and that further tags will become availablein time.<p><p><tt>			.airc</tt> -- AIRSAR C-band Stokes matrix file<p><tt>			.airl</tt> -- AIRSAR L-band Stokes matrix file<p><tt>			.airp</tt> -- AIRSAR P-band Stokes matrix file<p><tt>			.sirc</tt> -- SIR-C file (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)<p><tt>			.byte</tt> -- simple generated byte file <p><p>1.1-3  A Note on Cube Files<p><p>Cube files have a tag too:  <tt>.cub </tt>.  This allows RAVEN to filter outother non-cube files from the 'Choose cube filename' widget (see Section 2.1-0)for your convenience.  It also lets RAVEN know that it is looking at a cubefile.  Be sure that all of your cube files have the .cub tag on them.<p><p>1.1-4 X-window Defaults<p><p>Here are some example entries that may make RAVEN run better in terms ofX-window displays.  These additions are made to your .Xdefaults file.  If youdo not have one already, feel free to create it.  These variables were set forusing RAVEN in Motif.  If running a different window system, you may want tocheck with your system administrator to see if the entries need to be changed.Also, you may make changes or additions to suit your tastes (such as changingthe widget colors, etc.).<p><p>	<tt>Idl*background:  #8900e500a000</tt><p><tt>	idl*foreground:  #000000000000</tt><p><tt>	*clientAutoPlace:  off</tt><p><tt>	idl.retain:  2</tt><p><p>There is also additional information on .Xdefaults settings in the IDLReference Guide.<tt></tt><p><tt></tt><p><b>Chapter 2:</b><p><b>RAVEN Initialization</b><p><b></b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u></b>In this user guide, many example widget menus are presented whichshow what the widget under discussion looks like.  Don't worry if your widgetsdo not look exactly like the example.  You may be using a different windowsystem from the window system which was used to create the examples (which wasMotif).<p><p>After typing<tt> raven </tt>at the shell prompt, you will soon see a window popup, which is the <b>RAVEN Initialization</b> menu.  This is the starting pointin any RAVEN session.  The idea here is to either:  <b>a)</b> <i>build</i> anew cube, <b>b)</b> <i>load</i> an existing cube, or <b>c) </b><i>edit </i>anexisiting cube for RAVEN to process.  In any case, RAVEN will not continue intothe image viewing functions until a cube has been specified from this menu.<p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u>2.0:  The Initialization Menu</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p><b><u>             </u></b><IMG SRC="r11.gif"><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u></b><p><p>The Initialization Menu is divided into four sections.  The first section,located at the top of the menu, simply contains an informative message.  Thesecond section, called 'Build New Cube', is the starting point for creating abrand new cube.  The third section, called 'Load Existing Cube', allows youspecify which cube you want to load into memory for use by RAVEN.  The lastsection, called 'Edit Existing Cube', is the entry point for modifying a cubethat you've already created.  Finally, the 'Quit Raven' button at the bottom ofthe menu will exit of RAVEN if you select it with the mouse.<p><p>Note that once you build a cube or edit a cube, you still need to actually loadit into memory.  After you've built a new cube or editted an existing one,you'll notice the cube name you last worked with is automatically placed in thewindow in the 'Load Existing Cube' section.  All you need to do now is simplyselect the 'Load It' button to load the cube into memory and enter the mainpart of RAVEN. <p><p><b>2.1:  Building a Cube</b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u></b>To build a new cube, select the 'Build It' button on theInitialization menu.  This causes the 'Build New Cube' menu to pop up on thescreen.  Cube creation requires the following items:  a source file needs to bespecified;  the images you wish to synthesize need to be specified;  theportion of the image you want to work with needs to be specified.  An outputcube filename is given and the cube is then created.  Keep in mind that whenyou're building a cube, you're dealing with only one source file, for example3908.airc.  If you want to synthesize images from 3908.airp and add them to thecube, you have to load your finished cube into the 'Edit Existing Cube' sectionon the Initialization menu and add new images to the cube from there.<p><p>2.1-0 Entering the Source Filename<p><p>The source filename is input at the top of the 'Build New Cube' menu and it canbe entered in two ways.  <p><p>The first way is to select the square button located at the top left corner ofthe menu.  This button causes the 'Choose Filename' menu to pop up.  This popup menu allows you to select the source filename with your mouse.  The fieldnext to the 'Path:' label shows the current directory you're in.   The leftwindow allows you to traverse to a new directory by selecting an item in thewindow.  The right window shows you all the files RAVEN recognizes as potentialsource files.  Select one of the files to be the source file, and the selectionwill be echoed in the narrow 'Selection:' window at the bottom the the menu.Select the 'ok' button to accept your choice and get back to the 'Build NewCube' menu.  You will see that you're selection has been automatically enteredin the text field at the top of the 'Build New Cube' menu.  You will see themessage 'Processing Image Options'.<p><p>The second way to enter the source filename is by simply typing it directlyinto the text widget at the top of the 'Build New Cube' menu.  After typing thename <p><p>                              <IMG SRC="r12.gif"><p><p>of the source file, keep the mouse pointer inside the text widget field and hitthe return key.  You will see the message 'Processing Image Options'.<p><p>At this point, the following four things happen.  1) The rest of the 'Build NewCube' menu becomes sensitized.  2) RAVEN detects the source type and dimensionsof the image in the data file writes this information underneath the sourcefile text widget.  3) RAVEN then writes a list of all the types of synthesizedimages that are available from this source type.  This list is written in thewidget with the label 'Available Images'.  4) RAVEN fills in the dimensions inthe label that starts with 'Maximum dimensions in image' located in the middleof the menu.<p><p>2.1-1 Selecting Images<p><p>The 'Available Images' list contains all of the images that can be synthesizedfrom the source file.  The scrollbars can be used to view all of the items, aswith any list widget.Clicking on an item in this list moves a copy of the imagename over to the 'Selected Images' list.  The 'Selected Images' list displaysthe available images that were selected for synthesis.  Only these images willbe synthesized from the list of available images.  To deselect a selected imageitem, just click on the name in the list.<p><p>2.1-2 Memory Calculation<p><p>This window gives the user a <i>rough</i> idea of how many images could be putinto the cube before the system cannot contain all of the cube contents inmemory.  It is merely a calculator and only gives a rough estimate of thenumber of images that can still be added, based on the size of the images, thenumber of the images, and a given estimate of available memory.  Theinformation provided in this window changes every time you add/delete an imagein the 'Selected Images' list or when you change the image region (as describedbelow).<p><p>2.1-3 Specifying a Region<p><p>RAVEN allows you to define a region of the image that you want to work with.You define the region by specifying the x and y offset from the (0,0) point inthe image, and specifying the number of samples and lines the region is tohave.  The values entered into the 'Image offset' text widgets located in thelower have of the menu represents how many pixels the synthesized images shouldbe shifted from the top corner (0,0) of the source file.  This allows the userto omit certain parts of source file data and to extract a smaller subset imagefrom the source file.  The X-axis is considered the sample (horizontal) axisand the Y-axis is the line (vertical) axis.  The maximum allowable dimensionsof the resultant images are reduced according to the amount of offsetspecified.  Update this label by pressing the &lt;REURN&gt; key after you'veentered the offsets. <p><p>The values entered in the 'Number of samples/Number of lines' text widgets arethe dimensions of the resultant images, constrained according to the offsetvalues given.  The image size can be anywhere from (1,1) to the maximumdimensions of the source file.  Pressing &lt;RETURN&gt; after an entry herewill activate the 'Memory Calculation' window.<p><p>2.1-4 Specifying the Output Cube Filename<p><p>The cube will be saved to the directory and filename specified in thiswidget.<p><p>2.1-5  Build the Cube<p><p>Pressing the 'Build Cube' button will cause the cube to be formed, with headerconstruction followed by byte image synthesis.  If a cube with the specifiedcube name already exists, an error message will be returned, warning the userthat another filename needs to be specified.  Also, a cube cannot beconstructed until the number of samples and the number of lines have beengiven.<p><p>2.1-6  Synthesizing an Image<p><p>Building a cube will require image synthesis (unless you're only reading inbyte data).  The synthesization process is as follows.  <p><p>For AIRSAR, RAVEN will open the source data file, de-compress the data, andcompute floating point data for the image from the uncompressed AIRSAR data.Once this is done, a menu called 'Synthesize Byte Image: xx Polarization' willpop up.  This menu contains an image window, a line of informative text, andbuttons.  <p><p>          <IMG SRC="r13.gif"><p><p>The synthesized byte image is displayed in the window and you can change howthe image looks by changing the scale factor and selecting the 'Execute' button(the scale factor is the number of standard deviations used in creating thebyte image).  The text window to the right of the 'Execute' button tells youwhat the equation that creates the byte image looks like.  You cannot edit thisequation.  When you are finished with this image, select the 'Keep' button.This will cause the currently displayed byte image to be written to the cube.<p><p>For SIR-C images, the following menu will pop up:<p><p>                         <IMG SRC="r14.gif"><p><p>In order to synthesize a SIR-C image, RAVEN needs to create a 'common blockheader file' (unless one already exists).  The common block header file iscreated from one of the SIR-C CEOS ascii header files, which is an output ofthe CEOS Tape Reader Program.  The name of this header typically has a syntaxthat looks like pr01556_img_ceos_ascii.  Also output from the SIR-C CEOS TapeReader program is the SIR-C image file.  <b>Note that the image file will haveto have been changed to xxxxx.sirx to have been recognized by RAVEN</b>.  <p><p>2.1-7  Canceling Out of the Menu.<p><p>The user can exit from the 'Build New Cube' menu at any time after entering asource file by pressing the 'Cancel' button.<p><p><b>2.2:  Loading a Cube</b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u></b>Now look at the 'Load Existing Cube' section of the RAVENInitialization menu.  Loading a cube causes the cube file specified in the textwidget to be loaded into memory, resulting in the exiting of the RavenInitialization menu and the activation of the main RAVEN analysis environment.Remember that even though you may have built a cube or edited a cube, you stillhave to load it into memory.<p><p>There are three ways for a cube filename to be entered into the text widget.First, you can click the button located next to the 'Enter cube name below:'label.  This causes the 'Choose Filename' menu to pop up.  Select a cube name,press the 'OK' button,  and you'll see the cube filename you chose has beenautomatically written into the text widget.<p><p>The second way to enter a cube name in the text widget is to type it directlyinto the text widget.<p><p>The third way a cube filename is entered into the text widget comes frombuilding or editing a cube.  Whatever cube file is used in building or editingis automatically put into text widget.<p><p>Once you're happy with the cube filename that's written in the text widget,select the 'Load It' button.  This will load the cube into memory, destroy theInitialization menu, and start up the RAVEN analysis environment.<p><p><b>2.3:  Editing a Cube</b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u></u></b>Now look at the 'Edit Existing Cube' section of the RAVENInitialization menu.<p>Editing causes the cube file shown in the text widget to be readied forediting.  Editing a cube consists of  adding to or deleting images from thecube.<p><p>First, you need to enter a cube filename into the text widget.  You can do thisby either using the 'Choose Filename' pop-up menu (click the button next to the'Enter cube name below:' label) or type the cube filename directly into thetext widget.  Once you've done this, select the 'Edit It' button.  This willcause the 'Edit Cube' menu to pop up.<p><p>2.3-0  The Edit Cube Menu<p><p>This menu lets the user add images to the selected cube or delete images thatare already in the cube.  The 'Edit Cube' menu consists of an informationsection, a 'Cancel' button, a 'Delete Images' section, and an 'Add Images'section.<p><p>        <IMG SRC="r15.gif"><p><p><p>When the 'Edit It' button is pressed on the 'Initialization' menu, the cubeheader is read and critical values from the header are displayed at the top ofthe 'Edit Cube' menu.  Next to the information is the 'Cancel' button.Pressing this button will cancel the 'Edit Cube' menu and return the user tothe 'Initialization' menu.<p><p>Only one of the edit operations may be performed per editing session.  Eitherthe user adds selected images by pressing the 'Add to Cube' button OR deletesselected images by pressing the 'Delete' button.<p><p>Note the 'Memory Calculation' window only relates to the 'Add Images' sectionand does not display values reflecting any changes made in the 'Delete Images'section.  Think of 'Add Images' and 'Delete Images' as two distinct andseparate functions, running independently of each other.<p><p>2.3-1  Deleting Images<p><p>Look at the 'Delete Images' section of the 'Edit Cube' menu.  This sectionconsists of a list widget called 'Current Images', a list widget called 'Imagesto Delete', and a 'Delete' button.  The 'Current Images' list is a list of allthe images that are currently in the cube.  Selecting an item from this listwill remove it and place it in the 'Images to Delete' list so it will betargeted for deletion.  Selecting a list item from the 'Images to Delete' listwill put it back in the 'Current Images' list and remove it from the 'Images toDelete' list.<p><p>Pressing the 'Delete' button will result in the deletion of all of the imagesin the 'Images to Delete' list.  Note that there is no double-checking on thisprocess.  Once the 'Delete' button is pushed, the images are effectively gone.The user will then be returned to the 'Raven Initialization' window.<p><p>2.3-2  Adding Images<p><p>The 'Add Images' section of the 'Edit Cube' menu is essentially the same as the'Build New Cube' menu (see  Section 2.1) except that there is no need forspecifying image offsets and dimensions, since the values were previouslydefined when the cube was created.	<p><p><p><b>Chapter 3:</b><p><b>RAVEN High-Level Overview</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p><b></b>Once the 'Load It' button is pressed in the 'Initialization' menu, thatwindow is erased and what soon appears is a message window indicating that thecube you selected is being opened.  As long as everything loads okay, you willbegin to see the picture shown below, which essentially fills the entirescreen.  	All the windows can be moved around on the screen and seated whereuseful.  The first and foremost window is the main image window, which containsthe official RAVEN title at the top and the full size image displayed inside.The other windows you should see are the Zoom, Image Selection, and maybe theFull Image Roam (if your image can't completely fit on your computer screen).You will also see the RAVEN Control menu.<p><p>               <IMG SRC="r16.gif"><p><b></b><p><b>3.0:  Main Image Window</b><p><b></b><p> The main image window is sized to the image when the RAVEN Main Process startsup and will be smaller for smaller images.<p><p>Although not noticeable in the picture, a box resides on top of the image,indicating the region that is currently being examined by the Zoom window andpossibly by other processes.  This box can be moved by clicking a differentlocation on the image with the mouse.  The Zoom window will then respond bychanging its magnified view to encompass the newly-placed box region.<p><p><b>3.1:  Control Menu</b><p><b></b><p> This menu provides access to all of the basic RAVEN functions on a singleplatform.  A Status Board supplies information about the current image that'sbeing displayed.  list widget is given to aid in keeping windows visible.  Aset of buttons activates primary RAVEN processes.  Included is a window,displaying the current status of RAVEN, indicating the current image shown andother cube-related specifics.<p><p><IMG SRC="r17.gif"><p><p>In the middle of the Control Menu are the button widgets.  Selecting a buttonstarts up a specific operation.  Buttons with italicized labels have pull-downmenus associated with them.  This section of menu buttons contains thefunctions for analyzing polarimetric data.  The first is the 'Statistics' menu,which contains the means of collecting and displaying basic statistics of animage set by selecting individual pixels or selecting a polygonal region ofinterest.  The 'Graph' menu contains functions for plotting data points derivedfrom generated statistics.  The 'Model' menu contains functions that will allowfor models and simulations to be performed based on generated data.<p><p>Also on the Control menu is list widget called 'Current Windows'.  Contained inthis list are all of the windows that are currently up.  Clicking on an item inthe list will bring the corresponding window to the front of all the otherwindows.  This is helpful when you have lost a window and it is hiddensomewhere behind another one.  It also acts as a roster of the windows that youcurrently have active.  Note that not all of the windows and platforms used inRAVEN are registered in this list, merely because of their temporary nature.<p><p><b>3.2:  Main Zoom Window</b><p><b></b><p>The main 'Zoom' window shows a subsection of an image at varying levels ofmagnification.  The main zoom window has the label 'Image Window' displayed onone line, followed by coordinates on the next line, followed by pixel data.The area encompassed by the zoom window is indicated by the green box cornerson the main image window.  As the zoom level is changed larger or smaller, thebox corners change the area that they delineate on the image window.  <p>                                      <IMG SRC="r18.gif"><p><p>The user can zoom out up to 1X magnification by pressing the left mouse buttonwhile the cursor is in the zoom display.   The right mouse button allows formagnification increases up to 16X magnification.  The zoom value is shown inthe bottom left-hand corner of the zoom display.  The user can point to a pixelin the zoom display, and upon pressing the middle button, the zoom will centeron this point, with the crosshairs lining up on that pixel.  The data shownbelow the window always refers to the pixel currently in the crosshairs.  Thegreen box corners in the image window will move accordingly.<p><p>Also, clicking any location in the main image window will cause the zoom windowto pan to that location.  When RGB overlays are used, the zoom window will alsodisplay a three-color overlay, with the three separate pixel values displayedsimultaneously below the zoom display.<p><p><b>3.3:  Full Image Roam Window</b><p><b></b><p> This window allows the user to change the main image window's current viewfrom one section of a very large image to another.  This window only appears ifthe dimensions of the cube image exceed that of the display.  In order to slideto a different area, simply hold down the left mouse button in the window andslide the "box" outline to encompass the region of interest.  After a moment,the main image window will shift to the specified region.<p><p>                                         <IMG SRC="r19.gif"><p><p>The image shown in the 'Full Image Roam' window is effectively a sub-sample ofthe original image, scaled to fit in the small window space.<p><p><b>3.4:  Image Selection Menu</b><p><b></b><p>This is an important part of RAVEN because it allows the user to switch viewsfrom one image in the cube to another at the touch of a button.<p><p>                           <IMG SRC="r110.gif"><p><p>At the top of this platform is a list, showing all of the images present in thecube.  Below that are three sections for specifying an image name for display.Each of the sections is used for calling a certain display type, whether it bea normal grey scale, or a three-color overlay, or an image-specific zoomwindow.<p>Along the bottom are the activation buttons.  Only one is sensitive at any onetime and reflects which selection is currently active.<p><p><b>Chapter 4:</b><p><b>RAVEN Statistics Toolkit</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>Selecting the Statistics button on the 'Control' menu will cause a pulldown menu to be displayed.  There are two items to choose from on the pull downmenu, 'Preferences' and 'Make Patches'.

This menu contains three sections,an information message at the top, a band (image) selection section in themiddle, and an output units selector at the bottom. <p><p>                                    <IMG SRC="r111.gif">21<p><p>The band selection section of the menu contains two text windows, 'Select ABand:' and 'Bands Selected:'.  In this section, band is another name for image.Clicking on a band name in the 'Select a Band:' text window will cause thatband name to appear in the 'Bands Selected:' text window.  All the bands in the'Bands Selected' text window will have statistics computed on them when youcreate patch statistics in the 'Make Patches' menu.  You can de-select a bandby clicking on it.<p><p>You specify what units you want your output to be in by clicking on theavailable units in the 'Select Output Units' section.  Note that you shouldonly chose 'Phase' for phase images and 'Corr. Coeff.' for correlationcoefficient bands.<p><p><b>4.1:  Make Patches</b><p><b></b><p>4.1-0  The 'Make Patches' Menu<p><p>Selecting the 'Make Patches' line item in the 'Statistics' button causes the'Statistics:  Make Patches' menu to pop up.  This menu contains five sectionsand a 'Cancel' button.<p><p>          <IMG SRC="r112.gif"><p><p>The first section is the Message text window.  This window provides informationthat guides you through the steps you need to take to make a patch.<p><p>The second section, located at the top right portion of the menu, lets youspecify how you want to create a patch.  If you click on the image windowbutton, you will create a patch from a window that is the same size and has thesame display as the image window.  If you click on the zoom window button, youwill create a patch from a window that is the same size and has the samedisplay as the zoom window.  If you click on the 'read patch file' button, youwill be prompted to supply the name of an already existing file that containsdata which defines one or more patches (the next paragraph tells how you createa patch file).<p><p>The third section asks whether you want to save all the patches you will createin this session to an output (ie. patch) file.  The default is 'NO'.  If youclick on 'YES', the text window in this section will become sensitized, and youneed to enter supply a filename for the patch file that will be created.<p><p>Once you've supplied all the information for sections one through 3, you thentell RAVEN you want to make the patch.  You do this by clicking on the 'MakeNew Patches' button.<p><p>4.1-1  Making a Patch<p><b></b><p><b></b>When you click on the 'Make New Patches' button in the 'Statistics: MakePatches' menu, a new menu pops up, titled 'Patch Selection'.  This menuconsists of an image window at the top and widget buttons at the bottom.<p>You can create a patch in two ways - as a single point or by outlining apolygon around the region.<p><p>         <IMG SRC="r113.gif"><p><p>To define a single point, do the following:<p>1)  At the bottom of the menu under label 'Selection Modes', select the 'Pixel'button.<p>2)  With your mouse, go into the image and select your pixel point.  You canselect more than one pixel point.<p>3)  To delete the last pixel in last-drawn-first-deleted order, press themiddle mouse button.<p><p>To outline a polygon, do the following:<p>1)   At the bottom of the menu under label 'Selection Modes', select the'Polygon' button (this is the default mode).<p>2)  With your mouse, go into the image and locate the region you want tooutline.<p>3) Using the left mouse button, click on points that outline the region.  Youwill notice a line is drawn from one point to the next.  To delete the lastsegment of the polygon, press the middle mouse button.  To close off thepolygon, press the third mouse button.<p>4)  To delete the last polygon in last-drawn-first-deleted order, make sureyour polygon is closed off and press the middle mouse button.<p><p>To get rid of all the patches you made, press the 'Clear All Pixels' buttons.<p><p>If you're happy with the patches you made and want to continue, press the'Accept Selected Pixels' button.  This will cause the 'Patch Selection' menu todisappear and re-activate the 'Statistics: Make Patches' menu.  Next, RAVENthen computes statistics for each patch you created.  Statistics are computedfor the patch areas in each of the bands you selected in the 'Statistics:Preferences' menu.  Statistics on the patch area include the mean, standarddeviation, kurtosis, average incidence angle, and it also specifies thewavelength of the band.<p><p><p><b>Chapter 5:</b><p><b>RAVEN Graph Toolkit</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>The graph toolkit provides several functions for analyzing your data.When you press the 'Graph' button on the 'Control' panel, a pull-down menu isdisplayed.  Your choices are 'Profile', 'Histogram', 'Co/Cross Pol &amp; Sig0',and 'Polarization Sig.'.<p><p><b>5.0:  Profile</b><p><b></b><p>The profile function allows you to draw a line segment on the display image andexamine the values of the pixels along that line segment.  Selecting the'Profile' line item in the 'Graph' button causes a pop-up menu called 'GraphToolkit: Profile' to be displayed.  <p><p><IMG SRC="r114.gif"><p><p>At the top of the menu, you can specify whether you wan t the values of theprofile displayed in dn, dB, or amplitude.  Note that some of these choices maybe greyed out depending on the type of image that is currently displayed.  Forexample, you can't get dB from a byte image.<p><p>Next, you can specify if you want the values of the profile vertices  to besaved to an output file.  You must select 'YES' or 'NO'.  <p><p>Finally, you must specify if you want to save the profile vertices and valuesto a file. <p>If you press 'YES', you are prompted to supply the name of the output file inthe newly sensitized text widget.  After supplying the filename, keep the mousecursor in the text widget window and press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key.  <p><p>Having specified 'YES' or 'NO', a message is written into the message box inthe middle of the menu.  It tells you to put the mouse in the image displaywindow and pick the two endpoints of the line segment (use the left mousebutton).  You'll see the profile written into the black window on the profilemenu.<p><p>Exit this function by putting your mouse in the image display window andpressing the third mouse button.<p><b></b><p><b>5.1:  Histogram</b><p><b></b><p>This function reads in a patch data file and displays a plot of dn, dB, oramplitude vs. Number of Pixels.  Selecting the 'Histogram' line item in the'Graph' button causes a pop up menu to appear.  <p><p>              <IMG SRC="r115.gif"><p><p>Supply the name of the patch data file, press the &lt;RETURN&gt; key, and the'Graph Toolkit:  Patch Histogram' menu will appear.  At the top of the menu isthe name of the data file being used.  Below that is the plot window, and belowthat are the buttons you use to select the output units for the plot.  Belowthat you'll find buttons that correspond to the number of patches that arefound in the patch data file.  When you press on a patch button, the histogramfor that patch will be displayed.<p><p>                           <IMG SRC="r116.gif"><p><b></b><p><b></b><p><b>5.2:  Co/Cross Polarization and Sigma0 Plots</b><p><b></b><p>This function requires an AIRSAR triplet (P-, L- and C-bands) and displaysthree types of plots:  a 3-dimensional co-polarization cross-section plot of apixel point, a 3-dimensional cross-polarization cross-section plot of a pixelpoint, and a plot of the sigma0 values (in P-, L- and C-band) for the pixelpoint.  <p><p>Select the 'Co/Cross &amp; Sig0' line item in the 'Graph' button on the'Control' panel.  This causes a pop-up menu called 'AIRSAR Images' to bedisplayed.  Use this menu to pick which triplet you want to look at.  Selectthe 'Done' button when you're ready with your choice.<p><p>Once you hit the 'Done' button, the plots will be displayed.  At the bottom ofboth the co- and cross-polarization plots are the buttons labeled '1', '2', and'3'.  Look at the main title bar of the plots window to see what these labelscorrespond to.<p>Selecting the '1', '2', or '3' buttons will bring up the various cross-sectionplots.  If you select a new point in the main image display window, all threeplots will be updated.<p><p><IMG SRC="r117.gif"><b>1</b><p><b></b><p><b>5.3:  Polarization Signatures</b><p><b></b><p>This function displays the co-polarized and cross-polarized polarizationsignatures for a given pixel or a patch as both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensionalsurfaces.  <p><p><p>5.3-0  Making a Polarization Signature<p><p>Select the 'Polarization Sig.' line item in the 'Graph' button causes a pop-upmenu called 'RADAR Images' to be displayed.  If you want to select an AIRSARimage in your cube click on the 'AIRSAR' button (likewise for SIR-C).<p>A list appears under the 'Select and Image' label, and you are to select thedata file you want to create the signature from.  When you've selected theimage, press the 'Done' button.<p><p>                                           <IMG SRC="r118.gif"><p><p>Next, a menu pops up called 'Polarization Signature:  Input Mode'.  <p><p>                  <IMG SRC="r119.gif"><p><p>This menu allows you to specify how you want to define the region you will bemaking a polarization signature for.  You can select from the zoom window, theimage window, or you can read in a patch file.  If you select zoom or image,the patch creation window appears and you can make your patch (see section 4.1for how to make a patch).  Once you've created the patch and accepted it, thepatch creation menu will disappear and a new menu containing the plots willappear.<p><p>If you select that you want to use patches from a patch file, you will beprompted to supply the name of the patch file.  Once you've entered thefilename in the text widget at the bottom of the 'Polarization Signature:Input Mode' menu, put the mouse cursor in the text widget window and press the&lt;RETURN&gt; key.  The will cause the pop-up menu to disappear, and thepolarization signature menu appears.  At the bottom of the menu you will seebuttons associated with the number of patches that are in the patch data file.By pressing on a patch number, you will see the plots appear for that patch.<p><p>5.3-1  The Polarization Signature Menu<p><p>This menu consists of windows for displaying the 2-D and 3-D plots as well asbuttons called 'Save', 'Color', and 'Close'.<p><p>                         <IMG SRC="r120.gif"><p><p>The 'Save' button is a pull-down menu containing two choices, 'Data File' and'Postscript File'.  If you select 'Data File',  the displayed polarizationplots will be saved to a binary file as two 181 x 91 arrays of floating pointnumbers.  Selecting 'Postscript File' will save the polarization signatureplots a postscript file.<p><p>Pressing the 'Color' button will toggle the 2-dimensional images to ablue-to-red (cool-to-hot) density slice, and the 3-dimensional surfaces toshaded surfaces with the same density slice.<p><p>Pressing the 'Close' button removes this menu from the screen.<p><p><b>Chapter 6:</b><p><b>RAVEN Model Toolkit</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p><b></b>Not yet implemented.<p><p><p><b>Chapter 7:</b><p><b>RAVEN Color Slicing</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>Color slicing causes a user-specified range of grey values in the image tochange to a different color.  This range can be specified in terms of dB, dn,phase, or correlation coefficient.  Once a range of values is selected and acolor picked for that range, any pixel on the image that falls in the rangewill change to the chosen color, marking out that range of values.  Note thatthe 'Color Slicing' button on the 'Control' menu displays a pull-down menu withdB, dn, phase, and corr. coeff. as the line items.  Some of these line itemswill be greyed out (ie. de-sensitized) depending on the type of image in thedisplay window.  For example, color slicing by phase only makes sense withphase images.  So if the image in the main display window is not a phase image,color slicing by phase will not be an available choice.  Note that colorslicing is done with respect to the image that is currently displayed in themain image window.  Only one 'Color Slicing' window may be brought up at anyone time.  The old window must be closed before attempting to bring up a newone.<p><p>If you are currently displaying an image in color, the 'Color Slicing' buttonis desensitized so that you can't invoke it.  The results returned would bemeaningless.  If 'Color Slicing' has been activated followed by color RGBoverlay, the color slicing will still take effect, creating meaninglessgarbage.  This is a pattern to be avoided.<p><p><b>7.0:  The Color Slicing Menu</b><p><b></b><p>The color slicing menu contains the following items.<p><p>               <IMG SRC="r121.gif"><p><p><p>At the top of the menu is some text that specifies the name of the image thatwill be color sliced and the range of values that the image contains.  <p><p>Next, there are two labels called 'Min xx' and 'Max xx' (xx = the type of colorslicing done), each with it's own text window.  You specify the lower and upperend of the range using these windows.  The range of values is confined to therange shown at the top of the menu.  Also, you are not allowed to enter aminimum value that is larger than the maximum value entry and vice versa.<p><p>The 'Color' button is a pull down menu that contains 16 color choices.  Eachrange that you pick must have a unique color associated with it, and you selecta color using this pull down menu.  This means that you can have up to 16ranges active at the same time.  You'll notice the box to the right of the'Color' button will change to the color that you select from the list.  If youdon't like the color, simply return to the menu and select another one.  Colorsthat get picked and assigned to a range will become desensitized in the colorlist.  This provision ensures that you don't use the same color twice for twodifferent slices.  When selecting a color, you might notice some of the darkareas on your image all of a sudden change to the color you selected for aslice.  Don't worry - this is not a permanent.  It's merely a side effect ofaltering the color table so that your color selection is visible to you.You'll also notice that the cursor moves immediately to the square color windowafter you select a color.  This is because changes to the color table won'tbecome visible <i>until</i> the mouse cursor is passed over a display window.Call it a feature.<p><p>The big window in the middle of the menu is a text widget.  This window willshow which ranges are active and the color associated with the range.<p><p>Below the range list window is a bar displaying all of the color table valuesfrom the minimum value to the maximum value.  This allows the user to see whatthe color table looks like at any given time as color slices are added or othercolor table modes are invoked.<p><p>The control buttons that direct the color slicing are at the bottom of themenu.  You may notice that when you press any of these buttons (except 'Exit'),the cursor is moved to this color bar.  This makes the color table changesimmediately visible.  <p><p><b>7.1:  The Control Buttons</b><p><b></b><p>7.1-0  Add Range<p><p>Pressing this button will create a color slice based on the minimum and maximumvalues and the chosen color.  Note that the color slice can only become activeif the minimum and maximum values are given in the entry boxes AND a color hasbeen selected.  You'll see the color slice information written in the rangelist in the middle of the menu.<p><p>If the user presses the 'Add Range' button when there is not a complete colorslice entry available, the image will toggle between the displaying colorslices and not displaying color slices.  This allows the user to flash back andforth between color slicing and the basic image for comparison.<p><p>7.1-1  Delete Range<p><p>To delete a color slice, select a color slice range from the range list withyour mouse.  Now press the 'Delete Range' button.  Pressing this button afterclicking an item in the range list will delete the slice from the image andremove it from the list.  Once deleted, it cannot be brought back.<p><p>7.1-2  Clear All Ranges<p><p>Pressing this button resets the color table and removes all color slices.Consider this a "reset" button.<p><p>7.1-3  Cool to Hot<p><p>This button alters the color table so that intensity values are displayed as acolor spectrum between the lowest value, blue, and the highest value, red.This button can also toggle between Cool to Hot mode and the previous displaymode whether it was the color sliced display or the normal display.<p><p>7.1-4  Blu-Red Phase<p><p>This button will only be visible if you're color slicing a phase image (inwhich values range from negative pi to positive pi).  The color table dithersfrom an intense red value to blue and then to red again.  The red values arethe +/- pi values and the blue represents values around zero radians.  Like the'Cool to Hot' button, this button can toggle between display modes as well.<p><p>7.1-5  Exit<p><p>Pressing this button exits the user from the 'Color Slicing' menu.  Any colorslices still in effect will remain until the user resets the color table byinvoking 'Color Slicing' again or selecting the 'Reset Contrast' button in the'Image <p>Contrast' menu.<p><p><b>7.2:  8-bit vs. 24-bit Color Slicing</b><p><b></b><p>In color slicing, we use a dn range of 0-255.  However, for 8 bit systems thereare never 255 free slots in the color table to work with.  The system willallocate some slots in the color table for it's own needs.  Because 256 colorslots are not available (the system generally allocates around 30 color tableslots for it's own use), this color slicing program will allocate all the<i>available</i> color table slots while in color slicing mode.  This meansthat the original RAVEN color table set up at the beginning of the program isover-written.  The user will notice the cross-hairs change color, and themagnification number in the zoom window also changes color.  The user will alsosee a slight shift in the displayed image because the image will have to beredisplayed using the higher resolution color table (ie. the image isredisplayed using more shades than before).  The original color table and imagewill be re-established when color slicing is finished.  This program scales dnvalues from range 0-255 into 0-num_available_colors (unless minimum dn value isimage is not = 0, in which case RAVEN shifts the values up the color table bythe value of the minimum dn), so the user thinks they're actually working withthe range 0-255. <p>  <p>For 24-bit systems, there are many slots available in the color table soscaling usually won't need to be done.<p><p><b>7.3:  About Slicing by dn, dB, Phase, and Correlation Coefficient</b><p><b></b><p>Whether you're doing color slicing by dB, phase, or correlation coefficient,the values must ultimately be expressed in dn in order to put the color sliceon the image (which is in dn).  So keep in mind that your color slicing is notexact.  For example, say a range of dB values is given, showing the minimum andmaximum possible values that the user can specify.  Due to statisticalclipping, these numbers do not reflect the true extent of the dB range of theimage, but refer simply to the dB range pointing sufficiently to all of thegrey scale values.<p><p><b>Chapter 8:</b><p><b>RAVEN Contrast</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>The contrast functions allow you to enhance the variation of grey scale valuesin the image.  Features in the image will then show up more clearly.  Also, youcan reset the image to its original intensity from this menu.  When you selectthe 'Contrast' button from the 'Control' menu, you can select one of twochoices, 'Vary Histogram Equ.' or 'Reset Contrast'.<p><p><b>8.0:  Vary Histogram Equ.  (Histogram Equalization)</b><p><b></b><p>Pressing this menu button brings up a window showing a plot of the histogramequalization function to be used.  The user varies the level of histogramequalization from 0 to 100 percent by moving the cursor horizontally in theplot window.  You will see the results in the image display.  Press the thirdmouse button to set the contrast level.  Note that only the color table isaltered - the data remains the same.<p><p><b>8.1:  Reset Contrast</b><p><b></b><p>This button will set the color table back to the RAVEN default, which is colortable 0 (linear grey scale).  Use this button any time while running RAVEN toreset the display when it has been altered by histogram equalization or colorslicing functions.<p><p><p><b>Chapter 9:</b><p><b>RAVEN Show Cube Header</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>Guess what the 'Show Cube Header' button on the 'Control' menu does.  Press itand find out.<p><p>                             <IMG SRC="r122.gif"><p><p><b>Chapter 10:</b><p><b>RAVEN Output Byte Image</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>You're cube contains byte images, and you can the write byte data for any imagein the cube to a file.  You do this by selecting the 'Output Byte Image' buttonon the 'Control' menu.  Once you've selected this button, a menu pops up called'Output Byte Image' and this menu consists of three sections.  <p><p>                 <IMG SRC="r123.gif"><p><p>In the first section, you select which byte image you want to write to a fileby selecting the name of the image in the 'Select a byte image:' list widget.This action will cause the name of the selected band to be echoed in the'Selected Image' box, and it also causes a default output filename to bewritten in the output filename text widget located in the next section on themenu.<p><p>The second section requires you to fill in the name of the output file.  If youdon't like the default name that gets put in there, just move your mouse intothe box and type in the name you want.<p><p>Once you've supplied the information in sections one and two, tell RAVEN towrite the data to the file by selecting the 'Do It!' button in the thirdsection.  Next to this button is a little message window that tells you whatRAVEN is doing.<p><p>Note that there is NO header written to this byte file.  This means that youhave to keep track of the number of lines and samples that define the size ofthe image.<p><p><b>Chapter 11:</b><p><b>RAVEN Image Selection Menu</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>The 'Image Selection' menu allows the user to switch views from one image inthe cube to another or create multiple zoom windows (one for any band in thecube you wish).<p><p>This menu contains five sections.  The first section contains a list of all theimages that are in your cube.  The second section contains a button, the label'Grey', and a text widget.  This section controls which image becomes thecurrent grey-scale image in the image display window.  The third sectioncontains three lines, where each line contains a button, the label 'Red','Green', or 'Blue', and a text widget.  This section controls which images areincluded in a three color overlay.  The fourth section contains a button, thelabel 'Zoom', and a text widget.  Use this section to specify which image youwant a zoom window created for.  The last section contains control buttonswhich execute based on the image names in the text widgets.  Only one issensitive at any one time and reflects which selection is currently active.<p><p><b>11.0:  Grey Scale </b><p><b></b><p>To put a grey scale image on the display, press the 'Grey' button.  Note thatthe 'Load Grey' button at the bottom of the menu is now sensitized.  Now selectan image from the image list.  The name of the selected image is shown in thetext field and may be changed by selecting a new item from the list above.Press the 'Load Grey' button and after a moment of processing, the selectedimage will be displayed.<p><p><b>11.1:  Color</b><p><b></b><p>This is similar to procedure for grey scale.  This time, the user has<i>three</i> colors to specify images for.  Click the button of the color youwant to select an image for and pick an image from the list above.  Once all ofthe colors have the desired choices, click the now active 'Load Color' buttonto bring up the overlay.  If your display monitor can make use of 24-bit color,pressing the 'Load Color' button will cause a pull down menu to appear.  Fromthis pull down menu, you can select if you want your color image to make use of8-bit or 24-bit color.  <p><p><b>11.2:  Multiple Zoom</b><p><b></b><p>RAVEN v 2.0 has the capability of displaying many zoom windows on the screen,all at the same time.  These additional zoom windows are <i>image-specific</i>,meaning that the user specifies the image that is being zoomed for each of thewindows.  Only one image-specific zoom window can be displayed per image.<p><p>To select an image to be zoomed, click the 'Zoom' button, select the image fromthe list widget, and then press the 'Load Zoom' button to bring up the zoomwindow.  All of the zoom windows are slaved to each other so that they examinethe same location and have the same zoom factor.  However, since each showsdata from a different image, the user will see different relationships of thesame region simultaneously.  Note that the image-specific zoom windows areslightly different than the default zoom window.  First of all, the extrawindows have a 'Quit' button.  Pressing this button will cause the window to bederegistered from RAVEN.  The main zoom window which has the label 'ImageWindow' cannot be exited and remains on the screen.<p><p>Also, you will note that the default zoom window is not image-specific, but isinstead <i>display</i>-specific.  This zoom window always displays datareferring the to currently displayed image.  When a new image is displayed inthe main image window, the default zoom window follows suit.  The other zoomwindows do not change, since they point to a particular image in all cases.<p><p>The default zoom window also is the only window that will display RGB overlays,mimicking the main image window when it performs a color overlay.<p><p><b>Chapter 12:</b><p><b>RAVEN Reporting Bugs</b><p><b></b><p><b></b><p>As RAVEN v 2.0 is a beta release, there are bound to be bugs and manysuggestions for improvement.  <p><p>To send a <b>bug</b> report, do the following:<p>1)  Address e-mail to raven@kahn.jpl.nasa.gov.<p>2)  Start off the Subject: line with 'Bug:   xxxxxxx' .

<title>How Do I Use The Sigma0 Program?</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"
      alink="#00FF00">

<font size=+1>

<center>
<IMG SRC="../../CEDLOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]">
<H1>How Do I Use The Sigma0 Program?</H1>
</center>

<a href="../../../DOCUMENT/SIGMA0/SIGMA0.HTM">
The entire <i>User's Guide to Sigma0</i>
</a>
is available. This guide covers both versions for the PC and Mac.
<p>

<i>
<b>Mac Users, Please Note:</b> The instructions below were meant for 
the PC compatible
version of <i>Sigma0</i>. However, <i>Sigma0</i> users for the Mac
can also follow the description below. Sigma0 works very similarly
on both the PC and Mac.
</i>
<p>

The basic requirements to run the <i>Sigma0</i>
program are an IBM-PC or compatible computer 
that will support an eight bit color monitor and that has at 
least 4 megabytes of RAM. 
The following instructions
assume the user has a basic knowledge of computer operations, 
such as copying, scrolling, and opening programs. 
These instructions are meant only to get you started on the 
programs. The best
way to go through them is with a computer and the 
CD readily in hand. Complete
instructions are included in the documentation files in the 
<i>Software</i> directory.

<h2>Sigma0 for the PC</h2>

	<i>Sigma0</i> was developed in order for scientists to be able to
easily interact with and display radar images. 
<p>

<i><b>Please note:</b> At the time of
this writing, the beta version of Sigma0 was included in the CD and,
while functional, it does contain software bugs. JPL provides this
software "AS IS" and makes no guarantees as to its fitness
for any particular purpose.
</i>
<p>

<h3>Installing Sigma0 on the PC</h3>

For instructions on how to install <i>Sigma0,</i> see the
<a href="../../../SOFTWARE/SIGMA0/README.TXT">
README.TXT file 
</a>
in the /SOFTWARE/SIGMA0 directory of the CD.

<h3>Displaying an Image</h3>

Some images on the SIR-CED CD-ROM
are in <i>Compressed Stokes</i> format and are
identified as *.STK.
Run <i>Sigma0</i> from the Program Manager in MS-Windows.
Choosing the menu items <b>File | Open Cmprsd Stokes</b>
will allow you to read and display a compressed stokes file.
<p>

Choose the TESTDATA.STK image file 
from the /SOFTWARE/SIGMA0/TESTDATA directory.
You will now be presented with a histogram and another blank window.
Click OK. The histogram will disappear and an image will be displayed.
<p>

Place the cursor on a dark portion and look at the top of the image.
You will see numbers representing the X and Y coordinates as well as a number
representing the radar backscatter value or <img src="SIGMA0.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0]">.
These
numbers tell you your location in the image and how reflective the surface was
to the radar. A large negative <img src="SIGMA0.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0]">indicates very low
reflectivity and appears as quite dark whereas a number close to zero indicates
very high reflectivity and will be quite light. 
The <img src="SIGMA0.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0]"> values are used by scientists who analyze radar
images. 
<p>

Close the file via <b>File | Close</b> and then open it again via
<b>File | Open Cmprsd Stokes.</b>
Again select
<b>HH</b>  and the histogram will appear. This time, however, move the tip of
the cursor to the gray bar underneath the histogram:  <p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="HISTOGRA.GIF" alt="[HISTOGRAM]">
</center>
<p>

Click and hold down the cursor while moving it to the left, until it is located
about one half to two thirds of the way from the left of the bar. Click
<b>OK</b>.  Notice how much more contrast is evident in this image. 
<P>
Now let's draw out a box around one of those areas. Move the cursor to a
location left and above the area you want to study. Click and hold the mouse
and move it downward  and to the right. You should see a green box.
Go to <b>Image | Zoom In.</b> Notice that this acts like a
magnifying glass. Zoom in several times. You will continue to enlarge the area
of interest. Draw out the window (box on bottom right) so that you can still
see a lot of the image. After you have zoomed several times, you will notice
that the command <b>Image |  Display Sigma 0s </b>becomes darkened<b>.  </b>Drag
down and select it. You will now see all the <img src="SIGMA0.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0]">
 printed in
the boxes.  <p>

Zoom out now using <b>Image |  Normal Size</b> or <b> Image |  Zoom Out. </b>You
will find that <b>Zoom Out</b> is especially useful for large images - it is
the equivalent of <b>Scale to Fit Window</b> in NIH Image.  <p>
Draw a small box again in a dark area. Go to <b>Statistics |  Mean and std dev.
</b>This produces a window which gives the mean value of <img src="SIGMA0.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0]">.
in the selected box as well as the standard deviation. You will note that this
can be saved as text and printed.<p>

We believe these instructions should get you up and running. 
<p>

GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!
<P>

The following instructionspresuppose basic knowledge of computer operations, such as copying, scrolling,and opening programs. Although the Macintosh programs will work with System 6,we have assumed in writing the instructions and the Lesson Guides that System 7will be available for most computers.<i>(If you are uncertain of what Systemyou are running, click  and hold on the Apple at the top left ofthe Menu bar.  The first line should read: </i> <b>About this Mac.  </b><i>Ifthis does not appear, you are running System 6.)</i>   <p>These instructions are meant only to get you started on the programs.  Thebest way to go through them is with a computer and the CD readily to hand.Complete instructions are included in the documentation files in the Softwaredirectory. <p><h2> NIH Image (for the MAC)</h2><b>NIH Image</b> was developed by the National Institutes of Health to allowscientists to study medical and biological systems.  It has since been adoptedfor other scientific applications, such as in the Planetary Data Systems CDseries.  Many of its features are quite specialized but many are similar tostandard Macintosh paint programs.  <p><b>1. <u>Getting started.</u></b>  We suggest that you copy <b>NIH Image</b>to the hard disks of all computers that will be used withthe Modules.  You will notice that when you copy the programs, <b>NIH Image</b>assumes the name <b>Image</b>. Wehave provided <b>NIH Image</b> version 1.57 on the SIRCED02 CD-ROM.  You willfind both a Power PC version of <b>NIH Image 1.57</b> (PPC) and a version forolder Macintoshes (68k) in the <b>Software</b> folder on the CD. <p>The Lesson Guides presuppose that you have followed the next instructions.  Wehave designed them to make it as easy as possible for you and your students tolocate the programs and the images that will be used.   You should make aliasesof the two principal programs and place the aliases on the desktop (System 7only).  This helps students locate the programs immediately and it also helpskeep them from inadvertently crashing the system by poking around looking forthe programs.  You will notice that the <b>NIH Image</b> icon is a microscope.<b><cite>To make an alias:</cite></b><i> Click on the name or icon of theprogram; Go to the  Menu Bar; Click on <b>File</b>; Drag the mouse to  <b>MakeAlias </b>and click. The alias will appear directly adjacent to the icon forthe original file.  Drag the  alias to the desktop.  When you  double-click onthe alias it will open the  original file.  </i><p><i></i><b>2. <u>Opening an image.</u> </b> You also need to place a folder onthe desk top labeled <b><u>Today's Images</u></b> and copy the images for anymodule into that folder.<p><b><cite>To make a folder:</cite><i>  File: New Folder.</i></b><i>   A newfolder will appear labeled "UNTITLED  FOLDER".  Drag this to the desktop.Click once on its name and wait.  A box will eventually appear around it.  Typethe name  </i><b><cite>Today's Images</cite><i> i</i></b><i>n the box.<b></b></i><p><i></i>Copy the images in the Module01 folder Images(Documents<b>:</b>Module01.txt<b>:</b>Image) into a temporaryfolder like <b><u>Today'sImages</u></b>.  Double click on the folder .  You should see several imageicons.  Double click on the icon <b>GalOptic.pic</b>.  This will open both the<b>NIH Image</b> program and the image  of earth taken from Galileo.  <p><b><u>To open a second image</u>  File:Open</b>.  You will be presented with awindow which shows several images.  Open as many as the memory can handle.Close them by clicking in the box in the upper left hand corner or by going to<b>File:Close.</b><p><b>3. <u>Image too Large for Screen.</u>  </b>Image and screen sizes vary.Some images may be too large to fit on the available screen.  In this case, youhave two options: <p>a) You can shrink the image by going to the Menu bar: <b>Options: Scale to FitWindow</b>.  Or you may click once in the small box at the top right of thetitle bar (the bar that says <b>GalOptic.pic)</b>.  <p>b) You may prefer to keep the image the same size and move it around on thescreen.  To do this, go to <b>Tools</b> (on the left hand side of the screen).Click the mouse on <IMG SRC="IMGSTA2.GIF">(second icon down on the left).  Now bring the mouse to the center of thescreen, click and hold it, and drag it up and to the left.  The image shouldmove with it. <p><IMG SRC="IMGSTA3.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMGSTA4.GIF"><p><p><p><p><b>4. <u>Enhancing an image</u>  </b>Open<b> TestImag.pic</b>  <b>NIH Image</b>displays images as 256 shades of gray or as 256 colors. In either case, eachshade or color has its own digital number (<b>DN</b>).  Go to the Look Up Tableor <b>LUT </b>(left side of screen)<b> </b>and bring the cursor from the bottomof the <b>LUT</b> to the top.  Look at the <b>Info</b> window as you do this.(If it is hidden, you may bring it up by clicking on <b>Windows:Info.)</b> Youshould see the <b>DN</b>s next to the word Values vary from  0 to 255 as youmove the cursor up and down the table. Move your cursor around <b>TestImag.pic.</b>This is an image of an area of tropical rain forest in Belize, CentralAmerica.  Notice that the DNs are very high in the dark portions and they comeclose to zero in the very light portions.  Notice also that the <b>Info</b>window also shows the X and Y coordinates of the tip of the cursor (or thecenter of the crossbar). This allows you to reference a particular pixel in theimage. <p>Often it is the case that most of the gray shades have DN values bunchedtogether and it is difficult to see much contrast. To see how heavily the pixelvalues are clustered you may go to <b>Analyze: Show Histogram.  </b>You willsee a histogram showing the number of pixels that have the DNs from 0 to 255,as below: <p><IMG SRC="IMGSTA5.GIF"><p>Now run the cursor along the base of the histogram and look at the <b>Info</b>window.<b>  </b>Notice how<b> </b>the values are clustered between DNs 167 and187.  You will often want to  improve the amount of contrast on your images byspreading out the DN values.  You may do this in several ways.<p>Go to <b>Tools</b> and double click on the rectangular selection tool <IMG SRC="IMGSTA6.GIF">(top right). This selects the entire image (you should see "ANTS" marchingaround the outside of the image.)  Now go to <b>Process: Enhance Contrast.</b>This will change the contrast just a little. Try <b>Process: Equalize.</b>Is there a more dramatic change? Now click on the image. The ants shoulddisappear. Then, go to <b>Process:Apply LUT. </b>Try <b>Analyze:Show Histogram</b>again. Notice how the histogram has changed. <b>NIH Image</b> spreads outthe number of pixels allocated to each gray value to make an image easier toread. You may experiment with enhancing contrast by doing several things. Drawout a box <i>(click and hold the mouse as you move down and to the right)</i>in an area where you would like to see more contrast.  Look at thehistogram before and after you Apply LUT. You may also move the graphic toolsaround by fooling with the <b>Map</b> at bottom left.<p><b>5. <u>Getting back to an original image.</u></b>  Often you will find thatyou or your student has made undesired changes in an image.  You will be happyto know that you will never change the original as stored in the CD.  Usually,however, you can redisplay the original image on your disk by going to:<b>File:Revert to Saved.  </b>If this does not work, get it from the CD. <p><b>6. </b> <b><u>Finding images to open.</u></b>  Occasionally, you will be inthe <b>NIH Image</b> program and you will need to move from one folder toanother.  For example, you may be in the NIH Image folder and need to get adesktop folder or to the CD.  Go to <b>File:Open</b> and this box will come upon the screen:<p><IMG SRC="IMGSTA7.GIF"><p>Notice that there are no choices shown in the window. To find your way tofolders which will offer you choices, you should bring the cursor to the arrownext to the words <b>NIH Image, </b>and click and hold<b>. </b>A menu will popdown.  Continue to hold while pulling down to the desired folder, such as<b>Today's Images (</b>or you may click on the <b>Desktop</b> icon next to thewindow). You should see a selection of folders. Continue to open them (doubleclick) until you reach the folder and image you wish.  You may have as manyimages open as you have available memory. An efficient way of viewing severalimages is to go to <b>Windows:Tile Images </b>or<b> Windows:CascadeImages.</b><p><p><b>TIFF </b>and <b>PICT. </b>These are the two file formats that are openeddirectly by the command <b>Open</b> as used in <b>NIH Image</b>. Many othersorts of images can be opened as well, by using the command <b>Import</b>, asyou will see later in  Module 3 activities. <p><b>7.  <u>Enlarging an image.</u></b>  Bring up an image, go to <b>Tools,</b>and click on the magnifying glass <IMG SRC="IMGSTA8.GIF">.Now bring the cursor to a section of the image that you would like to enlarge.Click on that section. You can see the image has enlarged.  If you clickseveral times, you will note that the image gets larger and larger until youreach the limit of its resolution. Notice that the pixel itself enlarges.  Movethe mouse around and verify that the <b>DN</b> remains the same for the entirepixel as it is enlarged.<p><b>Returning to the original size. </b>Hold down the Option key on the keyboardas you click in the window or double click on  <IMG SRC="IMGSTA9.GIF">.<p><b>Deselecting the magnifying glass.</b>  Click on another tool icon to get outof the magnifying glass mode.<p><b>8 <u>Changing from grayscale to color</u></b> Bring up <b>TestImag.pic</b>Go to <b>Options: Color Tables.  </b>Move the cursor to the right and clickon <b>Fire 1.</b>  Then try the other available selections.  Select a pixel andcheck its DN as you go from one Color Table to another.  Now bring up<b>EARTHGAL.PIC.</b>  Go to <b>Options:Grayscale.  </b>Now check the othercolor tables.   <p><b>9.<u> Saving changes</u>  NIH Image</b> will not save changes to an imageunless you tell it to do so.  If you would like to save an altered version ofthe image you have been working with, go to <b>File:Save As.  </b>A window willpop up that will ask you to give the file a name and will give you severalchoices.  Name the file and consider where you wish to save. it.  You may wishto establish a Desktop folder named <b>Saved Images </b>for students to puttheir work into.  <i>(Click on Desktop on the right of the Image window.  Clickon <b>Saved Images.  </b>Then click on <b>Open</b>.  Finally Click on<b>Save.)</b> </i><p><i></i><b>Closing images and exiting the program.  File: Close and File:Quit.</b>If you have forgotten to save your changes, Image will give you aprompt.<i></i><p><i></i>You will discover many features to <b>NIH image</b> as you go along.  Weurge you to read the documentation (<b>About NIH Image</b>) and to explore thefeatures.  If you encounter problems with memory, be sure to read the nextsection as well as the section in the documentation on memory thoroughly.<p><p><p><b>*  Memory management in NIH IMAGE<u> </u></b><p>Image processing, by its nature,  is very memory intensive.Sooner or later you will get a message that memory is low.  You will get thismessage for one of two reasons: there is a problem with "EXTERNAL MEMORY" or aproblem with "INTERNAL MEMORY".  Dealing with these problems can be extremelyfrustrating.  What follows is first a description of what the various memoryterms mean and steps to follow in setting the memory and trouble shooting theproblems.  Then we will address some common memory messages and give somesteps.<p>1) <b>External Memory</b> We use this term to refer to the amount of memorythat the program occupies on your computer when it is open. Typically, when youhave a problem with this, either the program won't start up or you will receivethe following sort of Memory Message:<p><IMG SRC="IMGSTA10.GIF"><p>Since images tend to be very large, programs that work with them often need tooccupy lots of memory.  If you have a problem with external memory, you willneed to make more memory available to the program or you will need to reducethe amount of memory the program needs.   Ideally, you should have at leastthree times as much memory available for <b>NIH Image</b> as the size of thelargest image you will use. However, you can run the program with substantiallyless. There are a number of steps you should follow.<p>a) Sometimes there is a simple solution. You may have several other programsopen. Close everything that is open but <b>NIH Image</b>. <i>(</i> <i>You canfind out what else is running by clicking and holding on the icon at the topright of your screen., next to the question mark).  </i><p><i></i>b) Sometimes, due to the fact that memory can be "SPLIT" by previousapplications, you will need to close everything, restart the computer, and thenopen <b>NIH Image</b>.<p>b) You may still have a problem because your computer does not have enoughRAM. You can find out how much memory <b>NIH Image</b> is currently using byclosing the program, highlighting the <b>Image</b> icon, and going to: <p><b> File: Get Info.</b>  (<i>If you have clicked on the Alias, you must nowclick on Find Original and then on File:Get Info again.)</i>   You will see twoboxes at the bottom:<p>Suggested Size: 4000K Minimum Preferred Size: 4000K*<p> * This is called Current Size in some earlier versions of Image <p> You may change the size of the memory the program requires by changing thenumber in the Current Size box. You may change this number up or down,according to your needs. <b>Click at the top left of the Get Info window toclose it and implement the changes the memory allocation for NIH Image you havemade.</b><p>2) <b>Internal Memory</b> You will occasionally receive the followingmessage:<p><IMG SRC="IMGSTA11.GIF"><p><p>We are referring to the Clipboard and Undo buffers when we refer to InternalMemory. Image processing programs have many tools with which you can change theappearance of images that are being displayed. <b>NIH</b> <b>Image</b> keeps acopy of the original image in a buffer within the program, in order to provideyou the opportunity to Undo any changes you make.  It also keeps space to putitems into the Clipboard for standard Copy and Paste operations. If yourbuffers are too small, you may be unable to complete an operation or, aftercompleting the operation, you may be unable to return to the original image.On the other hand, if you have set the buffers too large, you may receivethreatening messages when you open the program. In general, you may ignore thelatter.<p>  To set the Internal Memory, do the following. After opening <b>Image </b>youshould go to <b>Options: Preferences</b>. Then go to <b>Undo &amp; Clipboard</b>buffer, double click in the box, and change the number.  Recall thatideally your buffer should be at least the size of the largest image you areworking with (but see below about <b>PICT</b> images). If you are low on<b>RAM,</b> you will not be able to get that high but you will increase whatyou are able to do by increasing the size of the buffers as much as you can.Then quit and restart <b>NIH Image </b>(you must do this in order for thechanges to take effect). Increasing the Internal Memory changes the ExternalMemory requirements. Thus, you should consider whether you will need toincrease the <b>Current Memory</b> to get rid of those annoying message boxes.Now, open up the program again. You should now be able to display most images.<p><b>3) Typical problems</b><p>a) The program won't open.  Try:<p> i) Closing all other applications<p> ii) Closing all applications and restarting the computer<p> iii) Reducing Preferred Memory<p>  iv) Running Virtual Memory (Check your System Manual or   ControlPanels:Memory) for this.  If you are able to run virtual   memory it will slowyour computer considerably but it will   allow you to do some things you wouldnot otherwise be able   to do.<p>b) You get messages that your Undo&amp;Clipboard Buffers are too small.  Youincrease their size and you get messages saying "CAN'T ALLOCATE THE UNDO &AMP;CLIPBOARD BUFFERS". Neither of these will be a problem if you only wish to lookat an image. If you wish to process it you need to increase the size of thePreferred Memory.<p>c) You changed the size of the Preferred Memory and it hasn't had any effect.Did you close the Get Info box after you typed in the size change? If so, tryincreasing it again.  <p>d) You open a few images and then run out of memory. Quit <b>NIH Image</b> andincrease the Preferred Memory, or decrease the memory allocated to the Undo&amp; Clipboard buffers.<p>e) You attempt to use one of the Tools and nothing happens. You need toincrease the memory allocated to the Undo &amp; Clipboard buffers.<p>f) The memory seems to have been set right.  Then you attempt to open a<b>PICT</b> image that should be 300K in size and you can't open it.<b>PICT</b> images are compressed - that is , they occupy less space whenstored on your disk than they do when opened up and displayed  In fact,  theycan occupy as much as 16 times as much memory when they are opened up.  if youare having a problem with them, you need to increase the Preferred Memory. <p>g) Nothing works.  Quit the program and go to the beach.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">      Teacher's Guide      </a>   </td>   <td>      <a href="../../../../ROADMAP/REFERMAP/FAQ.HTM">      Frequently Asked Questions      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<A NAME = "WHERE">
<H2>Where is the software?</H2>
</A>

All the software is located, naturally enough, in the <i>Software</i> 
directory at the top level of the CD directory.  

<A NAME = "HOW">
<H2>How is the software organized?</H2>

It's organized by software package, each having it's own 
directory containing the application and associated files.  

In the <i>Main</i> group, run the <i>File Manager.</i>
Go to the CD and browse the <i>Software</i> directory.  
You'll see few directories and/or files. 
Let's briefly go over what each software package does:<p>

<ul type=circle>
<li><i>MultiSpec</i> imaging software. For more information,
access the WWW site at
<a href="HTTP://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/~biehl/MultiSpec/">
http://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/~biehl/MultiSpec/</a>.
It is requested you register your copy of MultiSpec at the above website.
<p>

<li><i>Netscape 2.0</i> is the World Wide Web Browser 
    that you are now using in this Guided Tour.<br>
    <a href="../../../SOFTWARE/NETSCAPE/README.TXT">
    Installation instructions
    </a>
    are available.
<p>

<li><i>Quicktime Movie Player</i> is a 
    program for running Quicktime movies.<br>
    <a href="../../../SOFTWARE/QUICKTIM/README.TXT">
    Installation instructions
    </a>
    are available. 
<p>

<li><i>Picture Viewer</i>,
    a program that will read and display Macintosh PICT files on the PC.
    This program is part of the <i>Quicktime Movie</i> package listed
    above.
<P>

<li><i>Sigma0 1.0B for the PC</i> was written at the 
    Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  
    It is used for viewing and analyzing radar data especially
    compressed stokes image data.
    For a more detailed look at the Sigma0 program, see
    <A HREF = "SIGMAUSE.HTM">
    How Do I Use The Sigma0 Program?</A><p>

    <a href="../../../SOFTWARE/SIGMA0/README.TXT">
    Installation instructions
    </a>
    for <i>Sigma0</i> are available.
<p>


    <i><b>Please note:</b> At the time of this writing, this Sigma0
    is a beta version and still contains software bugs.
    JPL provides this software "AS IS" and 
    makes no guarantees as to its fitness for any particular purpose.</i>

</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, <i>NIH Image</i> is not provided with the PC version
of this CD. The main reason is no <i>NIH Image</i> version exists 
that will run under MS-Windows 3.1.

Radar image datagenerated by the SIR-C team will be compressed in several slightly differentformats to reduce the disk space usage requirements.  <p>	The software described in this user guide is designed to be used to decompressthe various SIR-C data formats.   These subroutines are provided to enableusers to quickly analyze and obtain results from SIR-C data.<p>	A separate CEOS reader software package is provided for reading the CEOSheaders.  This program is called CEOS_READER, has its own user guide, andaccompanies this software package.<p>	The software described in this user guide is intended to be copied andmodified by SIR-C investigators, and incorporated into analysis software thatthey may write.  In order to analyze SIR-C data, the data <b>must</b> bedecompressed to floating point numbers.  The floating point numbers may then beinterpreted by the investigator, converted to byte values, or used by existingsoftware packages for data analysis.  The software described here is not asubstitute for image display, analysis, or calibration software such as RAVEN,or POLCAL.<p>	The FORTRAN77 software described in this user guide is for converting SIR-Ccompressed format data to floating point values.  Input data may be multilookcomplex (MLC), multilook detected (MLD), or single look complex (SLC).  Thedecompression software converts the compressed format data to floating pointvalues.  These floating point values are either the elements of the scatteringmatrix (SLC data);  or 'crossproducts', which may be combined to form theStokes matrix (see appendix C).  See [1-2]  for a description of the Stokesmatrix and the cross-product format.  The recompression software is included incase the user wants to compress floating point values <u>back</u> to thecompressed format.<p>	There are four main programs included for demonstration purposes.  Thedecompression and recompression routines are all subroutines called by theseprograms. <p>	Each of these main programs sets up the appropriate lookup tables,decompresses the input image  file to floating point values, and types out somevalues for verification purposes.  Code for writing the recompressed  data backto the same file has been commented out, but is included so that investigatorswill see how to recompress data.  Due to round-off errors, the recompressedbytes might not be exactly the same as the original data file.  The purpose ofthese programs is to demonstrate how the compression subroutines work.  Theintent is that investigators would copy this software to their analysissoftware, and modify it for their needs.<p>	In addition to these demonstration programs, a program has been included inthis package for creating a byte image file from any format SIR-C data orAIRSAR CM or scattering matrix format data.  For quad-pol data, the user isallowed to synthesize any polarization into the byte image file.  For dual andsingle pol data, the user is allowed to select the polarization of the byteimage.  A subset of the data may be specified.  Software is <b>not</b> providedfor displaying these images. <p>	A program has also been included for multilooking any SIR-C or AIRSAR formatdata set.  The amount of multilooking in both range and azimuth is selectableby the user.<p>	Following a description of the software is a description of the compressionequations for SIR-C format data.  AIRSAR format data is discussed in  appendixA, as many SIR-C users may have experience and/or software for analysing AIRSARdata.    Software is provided here for converting from AIRSAR to SIR-C formatdata.  In appendix C is a description of the Stokes matrix in terms of thecrossproducts.  The difference between the AIRSAR 'CM' data and SIR-C MLC datais chiefly that, for AIRSAR, the elements of the Stokes Matrix are storeddirectly to each compressed byte;  while for SIR-C, the cross-products (whichwhen combined appropriately comprise the Stokes matrix) are stored.  Inaddition, the AIRSAR data employs a general scale factor, while SIR-C does not.<p>	See [3] for a description of the CEOS headers.  These subroutines assume thatthe first 12 bytes of each line of the input image file that have CEOS prefixinformation have been stripped off.  If this is not the case, the softwaredescribed here will yield erroneous results.<p> <p>	WARNING:  If the image data file has 12 bytes of prefix per line, and theexisting readit_CEOS subroutine is used, completely incorrect values willresult!  Software provided to the members of the SIR-C science team to transferdata from tape to disk, called CEOS_READER, strips off these bytes, but thedata files stored on the CEOS formatted tapes <b><u>do</u></b> have these 12bytes of header at the beginning of each line.<p><p>	Each 10 bytes of compressed MLC data yields 80 bytes of floating point values,linear combinations of which result in 36 bytes of floating point valuescorresponding to the nine independent values of the Stokes matrix.  Given thelarge data volume of the data sets from SIR-C, it is recommended that, ifpossible, data be decompressed only as needed.<p>	Makefiles for unix computers are included for compiling and linking thesoftware.  For VAX/VMS computers, .com files are included for compilation andlinking.  All of the software may be compiled and linked by using a single'make' command on a UNIX OS, which will use the included Makefile.  On aVAX/VMS computer, @all.com will compile and link all of the software.<p>	Please contact the author if you need any assistance.<p><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC2">2.Data Compression Software Description</a></u></b><p><b><u></u></b><p>	Each of the example main programs described in this section read two files.The first file contains some image parameters, and is created by the user.These parameters may be obtained from the CEOS headers associated with theimage file.  An example of this ASCII file is :<p><p>4,0,40960,4096,8192,10<p><p>These values correspond to the input image file.  This is the only line in thefile.  For the example above:<p>	4 : 	quad-pol SLC data	datatype	<p>	0 : 	quad-pol	datamode<p>	40960 :	the input image record length in bytes	reclen<p>	4096 : 	the number of samples	nsamp<p>	8192 :	the number of lines	nline<p>	10 : 	the number of bytes per sample	nbytes<p><p>A program has been supplied which will read the ASCII CEOS files that arecreated by the CEOS_READER software, and create this common block input file.This program is called create_in.f .  See appendix B for the a detaileddescription of these parameters and how they may be determined withoutcreate_in.f .  NOTE:  as is discussed in appendix B, the record length reclenshould be divided by <b>4</b> on some DEC computers.  This is because, on someDEC computers, the record length is in words, not bytes, and a word is 4 bytes.The program create_in will do this for you, when you tell it that you are usinga DEC computer.<p>	The second input file is the SIR-C input compressed image file name, and iscopied (using software that the SIR-C project will distribute with thissoftware) from a tape that the SIR-C project provides.<p><p>	All of the software was written in standard FORTRAN 77 as much as possible,and should work on any computer platform that meets the requirements of theCEOS tape reader software.      The demonstration programs are :<p><p>CREATE_IN	This program creates the common block file (with a user generatedname) that contains parameters to be used during compression.<p><p><p>SLC  	This program demonstrates the compression algorithms for Single LookComplex (SLC) data.    The user is prompted for the name of the common blockfile, and then for the name of the compressed SLC image file.<p><p>SLC-CROSS	This program  demonstrates the compression algorithms for  SingleLook Complex data.    This program is basically identical to SLC, except thatit also calculates the cross-products of the scattering matrix.<p><p>MLC	This program  demonstrates the compression algorithms for Multi LookComplex (MLC) data.    The user is prompted for the name of the common blockfile, and then for the name of the compressed MLC image file.<p><p><p>MLD	This program  demonstrates the compression algorithms for Multi LookDetected (MLD) data.    The user is prompted for the name of the common blockfile, and then for the name of the compressed MLD image file.<p><p><p>	The subroutines used in the decompression and recompression of the SIR-C dataare:<p><p><p>FASTSLC_SETUP	This subroutine calculates the lookup tables for SLCdecompression.<p><p>FASTSLC_D	This subroutine decompresses SLC data to floating point valuescorresponding to the elements of the scattering matrix.<p><p>FASTSCL_CROSS	This subroutine calculates the crossproducts of SLC scatteringmatrix elements that may be combined to give the elements of the Stokesmatrix.<p><p>FASTMLC_SETUP	This subroutine calculates the lookup tables for MLCdecompression.<p><p>FASTMLC_D	This subroutine decompresses MLC data to floating point valuescorresponding to crossproducts that may be combined to give the Stokesmatrix.<p><p>FASTMLD_SETUP	This subroutine calculates the lookup table for MLDdecompression.  FASTMLC_SETUP gives the same lookup table.<p><p>FASTMLD_D	This subroutine decompresses MLD data to floating point valuescorresponding to the detected power for this single pol dataset.<p><p>RECMPSLC	This subroutine compresses floating point scattering matrix elementsto the SIR-C compressed SLC format.<p><p>RECMPMLC	This subroutine compresses floating point crossproducts to the SIR-Ccompressed MLC format.<p><p>RECMPMLD	This subroutine compresses floating point detected values to the SIR-Ccompressed MLD format.<p><p>READIT_CEOS	This subroutine reads in one line of compressed CEOS format data.This subroutine assumes that there are no 12 non-data bytes at the beginning ofevery line.<p><p>WRITEIT_CEOS	This subroutine writes out one line of compressed CEOS-like formatdata.<p><p>READASCII_IMG	This subroutine reads some quantities from the ASCII CEOS headercreated by the program  CEOS_READER, prxxxxx_img_ceos_ascii.<p><p>	Many of these subroutines also include a file 'inc.inc'.  This file contains acommon block corresponding to image parameters read out of one of the inputfiles.<p>	<u>In order to compile and link these programs</u>, the software must first becopied to the users computer disk, into one directory.  The following unixcommand may then be used to compile and link the programs:<p><p>&gt; <b>make</b><p><b></b><p>	This command will compile and link all of the programs.  Likewise, all of themain programs may be created with the appropriate make file.  MAKESLC, MAKEMLC,MAKEMLD, MAKESLC_CROSS, and  MAKECREATE_IN,  will compile and link SLC, MLC,MLD, SLC_CROSS, and CREATE_IN, respectively.  <p>	On a VAX/VMS computer, command files have been included for compiling andlinking the software.  For example, the following command file could beexecuted :<p><p>&gt; <b>@all.com</b><p><p>	This command file would compile all the necessary subroutines and link themain programs.  SLC.COM, MLC.COM, MLD.COM, SLC_CROSS.COM, and CREATE_IN.COMwill compile and link SLC, MLC, MLD, SLC_CROSS, and CREATE_IN, respectively.<p>	Alternatively, the subroutines could to be individually compiled, and linkedto the main programs.  Examination of the make files or .com files willindicate which subroutines are required for each main program.  Appendix Ddescribes in more detail how to compile and link each main program.<p><b><u><a name="RTFToC3">3.Data Compression Examples</a></u></b><p><p>	Assume we have received an SLC quad-pol dataset, pr09999 .

Commented out from this demonstration program is a subroutinethat would write out the recompressed values.  Due to round-off errors, thesecompressed values might not be exactly the same as those input.<p><p>	Decompression of MLC and MLD data is very similar to the above.  Dual andsingle pol data formats are handled internally to the software, and executionof the software is the same.<p><b><u><a name="RTFToC4">4.Multilook of Data</a></u></b><p>	The datafiles from SIR-C will usually be quite large.  The radar swath  on theground, and the size of each image pixel in range and azimuth (samples andlines) will depend on the mode that the radar was operating in, and in theprocessing of the data that occurred.    For various reasons, the scientistusing this data may wish to have the data that they have received multilooked(averaged) by a selected amount in either range or azimuth.  For instance, theuser may want to multilook the data to reduce speckle, to make the datasetsmaller and more easily displayed, or to make SLC pixels more square in theground projection.  This multilooking is performed by finding the average ofthe cross-products of the Stokes matrix.<p>	Unlike the MLC and MLD format data that is produced during normal processingof SIR-C data, the multilook data sets created here from SLC data are<b>NOT</b> in the ground range projection.  SLC data is in the slant rangeprojection, in which samples in range correspond to distance from the radar,rather than distance on the ground from the nadir point of the radar, and thengeo-rectified to surface coordinates (i.e. ground range projection).  Even ifthe SLC data has square pixels, because it is in the slant range projection,they will not be square pixels on the ground.   Likewise, with any SLC datamultilooked to MLC or MLD format with the MULTILOOK program, the ground pixelsize of the resulting files will differ from the slant range pixel sizes.  MLCand MLD data that is multilooked with this program will, of course, still be inthe ground range projection, but, depending on the relative amount ofmultilooking in the range and azimuth direction,  may or may not have squarepixels. <p>	A program has been supplied that reads the ASCII CEOS leader file that theCEOS_READER software generates, and prints out miscellaneous information aboutthe file, such as incidence angle of the scene, the pixel spacings, scene name,etc from this leader file.  In addition, for SLC data (which is in the slantrange projection), it prints out a table indicating which multilooking optionswill result in somewhat square (but not exactly) ground pixels, and theresulting image pixel dimensions. This program also writes this information toa file.

This data set no longer corresponds to the CEOS headers in itsdimensions, which is why the new common block header file pr09995ml.input wascreated.<p>	On a DEC computer, the output record length must be evenly divisible by 4.  Ifit is not, then MULTILOOK will reduce the number of samples of the output untilthe record length is divisible by 4.  The program will know if this isnecessary by examination of the input record length (which will be 1/4 of thenumber of samples for a DEC computer) and the output number of samples.<p>	If MLC data is being multilooked, the result will be an MLC data set.  If MLDdata is being multilooked, then the result will be an MLD data set.  However,if an SLC data set is being multilooked, then, for quad pol and dual pol data,the output will be MLC quad or dual pol data;  and if the input data is SLCsingle pol data, then the result will be MLD data.<p>	There is a make file for compiling and linking this program.  It is calledMAKEMULTILOOK.  For a VMS computer, there is a .com file for the same purpose,multilook.com.  This program calls the decompression software describedpreviously.<p>	The MULTILOOK  program may also be used to multilook AIRSAR 'CM' compressedStokes matrix data and AIRSAR compressed scattering matrix data.  The CM datais multilooked and converted to MLC format, and the scattering matrix data ismultilooked and converted to MLC format.  It is assumed that the AIRSAR data isthe normal quad pol data format.  See section 6 for <p>a more complete description for using AIRSAR data.<p><p>	The main programs for multilooking data are:<p><p>	MULTILOOK -  This program multilooks any format SIR-C or AIRSAR data set toMLC or MLD format.  It generates a new common block header file thatcorresponds to this new data set.  It does not make corresponding CEOS headerfiles.  It does not resample SLC data to ground range.  It can be used toconvert AIRSAR CM data to MLC format, or AIRSAR SLC data to MLC format.<p>	INFO  -  This program reads in the SIR-C CEOS ASCII leader file that theCEOS_READER software generates, and saves to a file and to the screen variousparameters of<p>the data set.  It also calculates the effect of multilooking on the data interms of image dimensions and pixel spacings, to help the user choosemultilooking factors.<p><p>	A Subroutine that is called by these programs that is not described elsewhereis:<p><p>	READASCII_LDR - This program reads the ASCII CEOS leader file, and examinesthe Data Set Summary record, where many parameters of the scene may be found,decodes them, and saves them to a file.<p><p><b><u></u></b><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC5">5.Byte Image Generation</a></u></b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b></b>	Software is included in this package for creating a byte image of theamplitude of the data file from any format of SIR-C data or AIRSAR data.Depending on the format of the data, the user may select which polarization toconvert to a byte image.  For single pol data, there is no choice.  For dualpol data, the user may select either the total power, or one of the twochannels.  For quad pol data, the user may synthesize any transmit and receivepolarization to convert to a byte image file.  In order to synthesize anytransmit and receive polarization from quad-pol data, the following operationis performed :<p><p>p = Sr M St<p><p>	Where p is the power value for the chosen transmit and receive Stokes vectorsSt and Sr , and M is the Stokes matrix.  The Stokes vectors are given by<p><p>S =BBC[(Ahs4co1(1.0,cos(2[[psi]])*cos(2[[xi]]),sin(2[[psi]])*cos(2[[xi]]),sin(2[[xi])))<p><p>where [[psi]] is the orientations angle, and [[xi]] is the ellipticity angle ofthe polarization ellipse in degrees.  See [4] for further information.<p>	The following table lists common transmit and receive polarizations and thecorresponding orientation and ellipticity angles in degrees, where H ishorizontal polarization, V is vertical polarization, L is left circularpolarization, and R is right circular polarization.<p><p>polarization	[[psi]]t	[[xi]]t	[[psi]]r	[[xi]]r<p>HH	0	0	0	0<p>HV	0	0	0	90<p>VH	0	90	0	0<p>VV	0	90	0	90<p>LL	45	135	45	135<p>RR	45	45	45	45<p><p>where [[psi]]t is the transmit orientation angle, [[xi]]t is the transmitellipticity angle, [[psi]]r is the receive orientation angle, and [[xi]]rreceive ellipticity angle.  In addition, we may define the total power Pt  asthe sum of the powers for all four measured polarizations divided by 4 .<p><p>	In other words, given the transmit and receive orientation and ellipticityangles, we may synthesize the power for any transmit and receive polarizationwe like from the stokes matrix of the target.  We use the square root of thisquantity to convert to a byte image.<p>	The program BYTE_IMAGE has been provided for this purpose.  This program readsin any format of data, decompresses the data, synthesizes the desiredpolarization (for quad-pol data) or chooses the desired polarization (for dualand single pol data), determines a scale factor for the byte image file, scalesthe image to byte values and writes the result out to a file.  The user mayalso optionally select a subset of the data to be converted to a byte image.<p>	BYTE_IMAGE is composed of the following, in addition to decompressionsubroutines described in the previous chapter:<p><p>BYTE_IMAGE	This is the main program.  It prompts the user for file names,determines allowable polarizations, prompts the user for desired polarization,reads and calls subroutines for decompressing the data, calls subroutines forsynthesizing the appropriate polarization, determines a scale factor which maybe modified by the user, scales the data to bytes, and writes the result out toa file.<p><p>STOKES_SLC	This subroutine calculates the Stokes matrix from the cross-productsof the scattering matrix.<p><p>STOKES_MLC	This subroutine calculates the Stokes matrix from the cross-productsof the scattering matrix (for symmetrized data).<p><p>SYNTH	This subroutine synthesizes the power in a chosen polarization.<p>	<p>	MAKEBYTE_IMAGE is the unix make file for compiling and linking this program,as described in chapter 2, and BYTE_IMAGE.COM is the VAX/VMS command file forcompiling and linking the program.<p>	An example of the execution of using this program follows.

AIRSAR is a NASA/JPL multipolarization, three frequency (C-band, L-band,and P-band) airborne SAR.  AIRSAR data is stored in a slightly different formatthat SIR-C data.  There are no CEOS headers.  The standard product is currently16 look data, in which the Stokes matrix is compressed and stored directly,rather than the cross-products of the Stokes matrix that the SIR-C projectstores.  This format is known as AIRSAR CM data.  This data is NOT resampled tothe ground range  projection, but is in the slant range projection, which isthe natural projection of the SAR.  Another product that is distributed is thecompressed scattering matrix data, which is very similar to the SLC dataformat, but is not identical.  This data is also not resampled to ground rangeprojection.<p>	Another difference between AIRSAR data and SIR-C data is that AIRSAR data is'cornerturned' with respect to SIR-C data.  For SIR-C data, the range(cross-track distance) to each sample in the data file increases horizontallywith pixel sample number in the file, and azimuth (along-track) distanceincreases vertically with pixel line number in the file.  However, AIRSAR datais 'cornerturned' from SIR-C format data, with pixel samples of decreasingazimuth (along-track), and pixel lines of increasing range (cross-track).  <p>	AIRSAR data may have up to three lines of header information at the beginningof the file.  These three headers are called the newheader, the oldheader, andthe parameter header, respectively.  The program CREATE_IN_AIRSAR reads thenewheader to obtain image dimension information and to write that informationto an ASCII common block header file, for use with the software hereindescribed.  The subroutine AIRSAR_HDR reads the oldheader for just one value,the general scale factor, which is used in compressing the data.<p>	Some users may have existing software for  reading AIRSAR data, and analyzingit.  Therefore,  software is included here for converting MLC quad pol data toAIRSAR cm format, called MLC_TO_AIRSAR.  This conversion consists of selectinga region in the MLC image to convert, cornerturning the data, decompressing thecross-products, compressing the stokes matrix to the AIRSAR format, and writingnecessary AIRSAR header values to the first two  lines of the file.  Noparameter header is created, and only a few oldheader values are written.  Thenewheader is written in its entirety. The compression scale  factor in theoldheader is crucial for determing the sigma naught values, but its location inthe oldheader is somewhat non-standard.  However, its value written by theprogram MLC_TO_AIRSAR is always 1.0.  Other values that may be required willhave to be determined from the CEOS headers by the user.   If a quad pol SLCdata set must be converted to the AIRSAR cm format, the user should first usethe MULTILOOK program to multilook the data to the MLC format.  One requirmentfor AIRSAR data is that the record length must be 10240 bytes (in azimuth).Therefore, after any multilooking, there should be at least 1024 lines of MLCdata in azimuth.  In addition, AIRSAR cm format data is only defined for quadpol data.<p>	If the user has AIRSAR data to manipulate, the ASCII common block header filemay be created from either CREATE_IN_AIRSAR or by manually entering the values(see Appendix B).  Then, the user may use one of three programs:<p><p>	MULTILOOK - This program may be used to multilook the data any number oflooks, Both SIR-C format data and AIRSAR format data.  The result will bestored in the MLC data format.  The data is NOT resampled to the ground rangeprojection.  There will be no CEOS headers created, though a common blockheader file will be created corresponding to this new data file.<p><p>	BYTE_IMAGE - This program may be used to create a byte image of either AIRSARdata format.<p><p>	AIRSAR_SCAT2SLC  -  This program may be used to convert the AIRSAR scatteringmatrix format data to the SIR-C SLC data format.  There will be no CEOS headerscreated, though a common block header file will be created corresponding tothis new data file.<p><p>	If the user wishes to convert AIRSAR data to SIR-C format, the following maybe done: for AIRSAR CM data, the program MULTILOOK may be run, in which, if nomultilooking is desired, a multilook of 1 in both directions may be calculated.The resulting data file will simply be the AIRSAR file in SIR-C MLC format(with no ground range resampling).  For AIRSAR scattering matrix data, theprogram AIRSAR_SCAT2SLC will convert the data format to SLC format.  Ifmultilooking is desired, the program MULTILOOK may be run, and the desiredmultilook data will be converted to MLC format.<p><p>	The following programs have been written specifically for AIRSAR format data:<p><p>	CREATE_IN_AIRSAR - This program reads the AIRSAR newheader, extracts thedimensions of the file, and writes it to an ASCII common block header file usedby all of the other software.<p><p>	AIRSAR_SCAT2SLC -  This program converts AIRSAR scattering matrix format datato SIR-C SLC format data.  It also creates an ASCII common block header fileused by all of the other software.<p>	<p>	The following subroutines have been written to decompress and read AIRSARdata:<p><p>	FASTCM_SETUP -  This subroutine sets up the look up tables for decompressionof AIRSAR CM data.  It requires as input the general scale factor.<p><p>	FASTSCAT_SETUP -  This subroutine sets up the look up tables for decompressionof AIRSAR scattering matrix data.  It requires as input the general scalefactor.<p><p>	FASTCM_D -  This subroutine decompresses AIRSAR CM format data, using thelookup tables generated by FASTCM_SETUP.<p><p>	UNSTOKES - This subroutine calculates the cross products of the Stokes matrixfrom the elements of the Stokes matrix.  This makes it possible for AIRSAR CMdata to be transparently used in other software.  This subroutine is called byFASTCM_D.<p><p>	FASTSCAT_D -  This subroutine decompresses AIRSAR scattering matrix formatdata, using the lookup tables generated by FASTSCAT_SETUP.<p><p>	AIRSAR_HDR -  This subroutine attempts to read the AIRSAR general scale factorfrom the oldheader.  If it is not able to decode the value, it prints thestring that it should occur in, and asks the user to input the value.  AIRSARscattering matrix data has the general scale factor in a slightly differentspot than CM data, and subsequently, has difficulty decoding the value.<p><p>	The following program may be used to  convert MLC quad pol data to AIRSAR CMformat.<p><p>	MLC_TO_AIRSAR  -  This program will convert a subset of an MLC quad pol dataset to AIRSAR CM data set.  The newheader will be written in its entirety, anda few values will be written to the oldheader.  The MLC data selected iscornerturned to be in agreement with the AIRSAR cm format.  There must beexactly 1024 azimuth lines converted.<p><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC7">7.Miscellaneous Software</a></u></b><p><b><u></u></b>	<p>	There are a few programs included here for relatively rare ,specializedapplications:<p><p>	Cornerturn (transpose) any format data.<p><p>	Convert compressed format data to floating point files, and floating pointfiles to cmpressed files.<p>	Convert dual pol SLC data to quad pol SLC data by either assuming that HV=VHand HH=VV, or that the HV=VH=HH-6dB (depending on mode).<p><p>	Convert quad pol SLC data to dual pol SLC data by eliminating twopolarizations.<p>	<p>	All of these programs are included here for testing purposes only.

Scientific investigations are proceeding quickly, andthere is a demand for a fast turnaround of results. <p>	Many investigators have experience using data from the airborne prototype ofSIR-C, called AIRSAR, which is a NASA/JPL quad-pol multi-frequency radar flownaboard a DC-8 aircraft.  AIRSAR has imaged many of the SIR-C supersites.  Someinvestigators have written software for analyzing AIRSAR data, or use programssuch as Macsigma0 which were written for AIRSAR data.<p>	This users guide describes FORTRAN77 software that converts AIRSAR data toSIR-C format, or converts SIR-C data to AIRSAR format.  It also describes howto read headers from both AIRSAR and SIR-C data.  For a complete description ofthe AIRSAR system, see [1].  For a complete description of the SIR-C headersand data formats, see [2,3].<p>	A separate CEOS reader software package is provided for reading the CEOSheaders and decompressing SIR-C data.  See [4] for details.  The softwaredescribed here is not a substitute for image display, analysis, or calibrationsoftware such as RAVEN, or POLCAL.<p>	There are many differences between AIRSAR format data and SIR-C format data,even though the data itself is very similar.<p><p>	1.  AIRSAR and SIR-C store header information differently.  AIRSAR headerinformation is found in the first three lines of the data files.  SIR-C headerand data are stored according to CEOS conventions.  SIR-C headers are stored inseparate files, in addition to the data file. <p><p>	2.  AIRSAR and SIR-C save different but related data quantities.  Both dataformats are compressed.  AIRSAR stores the Stokes Matrix, while SIR-C storesthe cross-products of the scattering matrix that make up the Stokes Matrix.<p><p>	3.  AIRSAR has a scale factor for the whole image, while SIR-C does not.  Thisscale factor is used to calibrate AIRSAR data to sigma0 values.<p><p>	4.  AIRSAR data is usually quad pol data, while SIR-C may be quad pol, dualpol, or single pol data.<p><p>	5.  AIRSAR data is usually in the "slant range" projection, while SIR-C datamay be in either the slant range projection or the "ground range" projection.<p><p>	6.  AIRSAR data (except synoptic) and SIR-C data are stored in the data filessuch that the cross track direction and along track directions are rotated 90degrees from one another.<p><p>	See [3] for a description of the CEOS headers.  The software described in thismanual assume that the first 12 bytes of each line of the input image file thathave CEOS prefix information have been stripped off.  If this is not the case,the software described here will yield erroneous results.<p> <p>	WARNING:  Software provided to the members of the SIR-C science team totransfer data from tape to disk, called CEOS_READER, is required before runningthe software for converting SIR-C data to AIRSAR format.  The CEOS_READERsoftware strips off the CEOS prefix bytes from the SIR-C data and writes theresults to disk.  If the CEOS prefix bytes are not stripped off, incorrectvalues will result.<p><p>	Makefiles for unix computers are included for compiling and linking thesoftware.  For VAX/VMS computers, .com files are included for compilation andlinking.  All of the software may be compiled and linked by using a single'make' command on a UNIX OS, which will use the included Makefile.  On aVAX/VMS computer, @all.com will compile and link the software.<p>	Please contact the author if you need any assistance.<p><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC2">2.Data Format Description</a></u></b><p><b><u></u></b><p><b>	AIRSAR data :</b><p><b></b>	<p>	AIRSAR data comes in three different data formats : CM (compressed Stokes), CCor CS (compressed complex/compressed scattering matrix), and SY (synoptic).The file name will begin with the two letter combination indicating the datatype.  In general, CM data and compressed scattering matrix data have 1024samples, unless modified by users and either 750 or 1279 lines.  SY data has1280 samples, unless modified by users, and 5088 lines.<p>	AIRSAR CM data is the most common AIRSAR format.  CM data is the compressedStokes Matrix format, in which multilooked, quad-pol AIRSAR data is stored.See Appendix B for a detailed description of the data compression of AIRSARdata.  The file structure is shown in figure 1.  During the history of AIRSAR,the header has changed slightly.  Until 1990, there were only two header linesof data, and the data was multilooked by a factor of 4 (processor version lessthan 3.0).  Since then, there have been three header lines, the data ismultilooked by 16, and the number of lines increased from 750 to 1279(processor version greater than 3.5).  In all cases, the number of samples hasbeen 1024, and each compressed Stokes Matrix pixel is 10 bytes.  AIRSAR CM datamay be converted to SIR-C MLC format (compression scale factor is applied todata).<p><IMG SRC="cvert2.gif"><p><p>	Figure 1.  AIRSAR CM data file structure<p><p>	The format of the AIRSAR headers is described in [1].  The first header lineis known as the 'new header', and contains quantities such as the number oflines and number of samples.  The second line is known as the "oldheader", andcontains miscellaneous quantities, the most important of which is the general(or compression) scale factor.  This number is an overall scaling factor usedto scale (i.e. calibrate) the data.  The third line, which exists for dataprocessed after 1990, is called the "parameter header", and contains manylabeled processing and calibration parameters.<p><p>	AIRSAR scattering matrix data is also an available AIRSAR format.  Scatteringmatrix data contains the compressed quad pol complex scattering matrixelements. See Appendix B for a detailed description of the data compression ofAIRSAR data.  The file structure is shown in figure 2.  Scattering matrix datahas not been multilooked.  This data may be converted to SIR-C SLC data, or itmay be multilooked and converted to MLC format with the included software. <p><p><IMG SRC="cvert3.gif"><p><p>	Figure 2.  AIRSAR scattering matrix data file structure<p><p>	AIRSAR synoptic data is another available AIRSAR format.  Synoptic datacontains the uncompressed single pol amplitude for each pixel.   The filestructure is shown in figure 3.  Synoptic data,unlike the CM and scatteringmatrix data, is not compressed, and there is no scale factor in the header.This data may be converted to SIR-C MLD format.<p><p><IMG SRC="cvert4.gif"><p><p>	Figure 3.  AIRSAR synoptic data file structure<p><p>	Airsar synoptic data is written on a VAX computer in unformatted floatingpoint format.  If this program is not run on a VAX computer, the synoptic datamust first be converted to the unformatted floating point format of thecomputer that this software is running on.  A program to do this conversion wasseparately developed [8].<p><p><b>	SIR-C data:</b><p><b></b><p>	The SIR-C data format has more flexibility than AIRSAR data.  It may have anynumber of lines or samples.  It may be in the ground range or slant rangeprojection.  It may be single pol, dual pol, or quad pol.<p><p><IMG SRC="cvert5.gif"><p><p>	Figure 4.  SIR-C data format<p><p>	A detailed description of SIR-C MLC data may be found in Appendix A.  Moregenerally, the SIR-C MLC data is "multilook complex data", which means that ithas been multilooked by some factor, and contains the cross-products of thescattering matrix in a compressed format.  The Stokes matrix may be determinedfrom the cross-products.  This data may be dual pol, or quad pol.  If it isquad pol, then the data may be converted to AIRSAR CM format.  If the data isdual pol, the software described here can not currently convert the data toAIRSAR format.<p>	MLC data is generally resampled to the ground range projection, but this isnot a requirement of the data format.  For instance, SIR-C SLC data may bemultilooked and stored as MLC data, or AIRSAR data may be stored as MLC data,but both are generally not in the ground range projection.<p>	Every SIR-C data take will consist of three files :  the leader file, theimage file, and the trailer file.  The CEOS reader software [4] reads thesefiles and creates several output files, including ascii header files, and animage file with the 12 CEOS prefix bytes removed.  THIS IS THE IMAGE FILE THATTHE SOFTWARE DESCRIBED HERE REQUIRES AS INPUT.  If the original CEOS files fromthe SIR-C tape are used, the software will not correctly decode the data.  Thisimage file is just data, with no header lines.<p><p>	SIR-C SLC data is "Single Look Complex" data that has not been multilooked, orresampled to a ground range projection.  It is similar to the AIRSAR scatteringmatrix data format.  Like the MLC data, it is stored with the CEOS conventions.See appendix A for a detailed description of the data compression format.  Thisdata may be single pol, dual pol, or quad pol.  If the data is quad pol, it maybe converted to AIRSAR scattering matrix format.  It may also be converted toAIRSAR CM format, by multilooking the data.  If the data is single pol or dualpol data, the software described here can not currently convert the data toAIRSAR format.<p><p>	SIR-C MLD data is "Multilook Detected" data that has been multilooked, and issingle pol.  It is normally in the ground range projection.  It is similar tothe AIRSAR synoptic format, except that it is compressed to 2 bytes per pixel.See appendix A for a detailed description.  This data format may be convertedonly to the AIRSAR synoptic format.<p><b><u><a name="RTFToC3">3.Software Description</a></u></b><p>	<p>	Before using this software, if SIR-C data is going to be converted to AIRSARformat, the data must be copied from the CEOS tape by the tape reader softwareas described in [4].  The user should make sure that the ASCII CEOS headers aresaved to disk along with the image file.<p>	The software described in this guide is a menu driven program that allows theuser to choose which options are desired.  See Appendix E for a description ofhow to compile and link the FORTRAN77 code.  The program is called CVERT, andit performs the following functions:<p><p>	1.  Reads SIR-C ASCII headers <p>		-    Two files may be created by CVERT.  One file is the common block headerfile that every module requires.  The other file is not required, butsummarizes important quantities from the CEOS headers, gives some guidelinesfor multiloooking,and contains header information required by AIRSAR header.See appendix C for a description of the common block header file.<p>	2.  Reads AIRSAR headers<p>		-  reads AIRSAR headers to create common block header file required forconversions.  See appendix C for a description of the common block headerfile.<p>	3.  Manually input header values<p>		-  Manually input values to create common block header file.  See appendix Cfor a description of the common block header file.<p>	4.  Convert AIRSAR CM data to SIR-C MLC data format<p>		-  No CEOS header files are created.  However, the resulting file may bemanipulated by the DCOMP software described in [4].<p>	5.  Convert AIRSAR scattering matrix data to SIR-C SLC data format<p>		-  No CEOS header files are created.  However, the resulting file may bemanipulated by the DCOMP software described in [4].<p>	6.  Convert AIRSAR synoptic data to SIR-C MLD data format<p>		-  No CEOS header files are created.  However, the resulting file may bemanipulated by the DCOMP software described in [4].  The synoptic file iswritten on a VAX computer in real floating point format, and must be convertedto the floating point format of the computer that this program is running on,if it is not a VAX [8].<p>	7.  Convert SIR-C MLC data to AIRSAR CM  data format<p>		-  Convert SIR-C MLC data to AIRSAR CM format with a "minimum" header that iscreated from  input values.  Only the AIRSAR "newheader" and "oldheader" arecreated.<p>	8.  Convert SIR-C SLC data to AIRSAR scattering matrix  data format  <p>		(NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)<p>	9.  Convert SIR-C SLC data to AIRSAR CM data format <p>		- No multilooking is performed.  The cross products are determined from thescattering matrix values, and the Stokes matrix is stored to the AIRSAR CMformat.<p> 	10.  Convert SIR-C MLD data to AIRSAR synoptic data format<p>		(NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)<p><p>	11.  Multilook SIR-C or AIRSAR data<p>		-  multilook either SIR-C or AIRSAR data.  Result is always SIR-C MLCformat.<p><p>	When converting SIR-C data to AIRSAR format, the AIRSAR headers must becreated.  In order to simplify, only the minimum number of entries are saved inthe AIRSAR headers.  It is not guaranteed that the AIRSAR header will agreeexactly with the standard AIRSAR header.  For instance, the altitude issignificantly greater for SIR-C, so all values are stored in kilometers ratherthan meters, including the pixel spacing.  This, unfortunately, is required bythe AIRSAR header format.<p><p>	The inputs to the CVERT program are the following:<p><p>	1.  The common block header file : This file is required for all conversionroutines.  This  file contains the characteristics of the data type and theimage dimensions, and is described in more detail in appendix C.  This file maybe created in three ways :  1)  reading the ASCII SIR-C CEOS files and creatingfile.  2)  reading the AIRSAR headers and creating file.  3)  manual input.<p><p>	2.  The data file to be converted :  This  file should not have the 12 byteCEOS prefix.  If the data is AIRSAR synoptic, it should be in the floatingpoint format for that computer.<p><p>	3.  When converting from SIR-C to AIRSAR format, parameters such as the pixelspacing and altitude must be entered.  These values may be found in the SIR-CASCII header files, or  from the .info file that may be created by this program(see above).<p><p>	The outputs of the CVERT program are the following:<p><p>	1.  Common block header file  :  When converting data types, CVERT willcalculate and write out the common block header file corresponding to theconverted data file.  If further conversion is required, this common blockheader file should be used.<p><p>	2.  Informational file : This file may be created from the ASCII SIR-C CEOSfiles that are created by the CEOS_READER program [4].   It is not required forfile conversion, but it does contain values that should be written to theAIRSAR headers.  When converting SIR-C data to AIRSAR format, the user will beprompted for values.  These values may be found in this file.  The next versionof this software will do this automatically.<p><p>	3.  The converted data file.  This file will be structured according to thedescription found in appendices A and B.  There is no required name conventionfor the input or output files.<p><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC4">4.Examples</a></u></b><p><b><u><a name="RTFToC5">4.1SIR-C to AIRSAR conversions</a></u></b><p><b><u></u></b><p>	If the data conversion is from SIR-C to AIRSAR, then the ASCII CEOS headersshould be read to determine quantities for both the common block header file,and the .info file that contains items that must be entered into the AIRSARheader.    The ASCII headers are created from the CEOS files by the CEOS_READERprogram [4]. <p>	After the common block header file and .info file have been created then theuser has options depending on input data format, and the desired output.<p><p>	If the input data is SLC quad pol data, then the user may:<p>	1. Multilook the data to SIR-C MLC format<p>	3. Convert the data directly to AIRSAR CM format (multilooking of 1).<p>	4.  Convert the data directly to AIRSAR scattering matrix format. (THIS OPTIONIS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) .<p><p>	If the input data is MLC quad pol, then the user may:<p>	1. Multilook the data to the same SIR-C MLC format.<p>	3.  Convert the data  AIRSAR CM format.<p><p>	For example, the following will show the user reading the ASCII headers,multilooking the SLC data to approximately ground range projection,  and thenconverting the resulting MLC data to AIRSAR CM format.   <p><p>(inputs are in <b>bold</b>, explanatory comments in <i>italics</i>, programexecution in normal type)<p><p> &gt;<b>cvert</b><p><b></b><p><b></b>   ******************************************************<p>   *    Copyright (c) 1994, California Institute of     <p>   *    Technology.

<h2>
     MISSION STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN
<br>
     DAY 10: O HRS AND DAY 11 0 HRS MISSION ELAPSED TIME
</h2><p>
     SUMMARY-Operations continued very smoothly. the decision was made
to
     continue interferometry data takes, but to allow the orbit to
slowly
     begin drifting to develop a data set with a large variety of
     baselines. Tests were run to help develop confidence in the
recorded
     now occupying the position of PHRR 1. The spare recorder and power
    supply had been put into this position to replace the original
     recorder in this position. It was determined that the spare was
     recording properly, but had a cross speed playback tracking
problem.
     The tapes being recorded were good.
     The SIR-C electronics were switched to the backup units to
     evaluate their health as an engineering check.
     36 tapes of X-SAR data were recorded  and 163 SIR-C tapes were
     recorded.
     SIR-C and X-SAR were shut down at 18:30 HRS MET and 12:00 HRS
     MET.  The crew began their descent and landing preparations which
     include stowing the Ku band communications antenna, closing the
cargo
     bay doors and stowing cameras, film, and other items.
     At the time of this report it is still unclear whether the
     landing will take place at the Kennedy Space Center or the Dryden
     facility. Weather is expected to be marginal at Kennedy.
     The final science press briefing was held.. The emphasis  was  on
     the interferometry results, which include detection of  change
between
     the April and October flights in the Long Valley Caldera in
California
     and  the Kiluaea area. in Hawaii. The Kiluaea changes were on the
     order of 10 cm and appear to be substantiated by independent GPS
     measurements.

<h2>Project updates 8,9,10</h2>
<h3>
SIR-C/X-SAR STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING
DAY 8:0 HRS TO DAY 9:0 HRS MISSION ELAPSED TIME
</h3>
<p>
The interferometry imaging activities began 5 hours into the day with
Data Take 118.1. Activities have proceeded according to plan
throughout this period without any significant issues. A total of 107
SIR-C tapes and 25 X-SAR tapes have been recorded.
</p><p>
Images of the oil slick along with full and close coverage images of
KSC were received for press release. A SIR-C calibration update was
received and the system has continued to be stable in terms of channel
amplitude and phase balances. The cross talk between horizontal and
vertical polarizations has remained low. To date, 3 image frames with
corner reflectors and 6 without have been analyzed and calibrated

</p><p>
ANOMALIES- One tape threading and one tape loading anomaly occurred.


</p><p>
<hr>
<h3>
SIR-C/X-SAR STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING
DAY 9:0 HRS TO DAY 10:0 HRS MISSION ELAPSED TIME
</h3>
<p>
SUMMARY-The interferometry imaging activities have proceeded according
to plan throughout this period . A total of 129 SIR-C tapes and 31
X-SAR tapes have been recorded.

</p><p>
Early indications are that the one day repeat targeting is
exceptionally accurate. A top of the orbit pass over Canada covering
some 200km had a repeat pass separation on the order of 70 m. Other
passes throughout the day averaged about 200 m separation.

</p><p>
Activity in the data procesing coninues at an intense  pace. Images of
Moscow, San Francisco, Otzal, the Weddell Sea and others are being
prepared for release. A topgraphic map of Mammoth is being prepared.
An image of Mammoth, Mt. was processed on the  Cray T3D supercomputer
at JPL as a (successful)  experiment.  A joint Italian/German team
working at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany has been working to
prepare interferometric SAR products .

</p><p>
ANOMALIES-

</p><p>
7 hours into the day, PHRR 1 began to exhibit high error rates.
Subsequent data playback tests from this recorder indicated it was
failing to record properly. All SIR-C recording was switched over to
PHRR 2. Since the last playback from that recorder occurred some 12
hours prior to the failed playback, all the data takes recorded since
then are suspect. Of the 29 repeat pass targets imaged during the PHRR
1 suspect performance period only 3 will be lost in the event that
data cannot be recovered from the tapes. PHRR 1 will be replaced by
the spare at the start of day 10.

</p><p>
8 hours 33 minutes into the day, C-band center leaf panel #2 failed in
the same manner as #6 causing loss of the V-pol transmitters within
the panel. As a consequence of these two failures, 1db of SNR will be
lost from the typical 10-15db of SNR for C band V-pol data. Adequate
performance margin still remains to accomplish the required imaging
science.


</p><p>
<hr>
<h3>
SIR-C/X-SAR STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING
DAY 10:0 HRS TO DAY11:0 HRS MISSION ELAPSED TIME
</h3><p>

SUMMARY-The interferometry imaging activities have proceeded according
to plan throughout this period . A total of 155 SIR-C tapes and 36
X-SAR tapes have been recorded, nearly 25 more than STS-59.

</p><p>
Activity in data processing continues at an intense pace. X-SAR images
recently released or planned for release include: Baikal Lake in
Russia; Mende, France(STS 59-68 seasonal change); Kennedy Space
Center, Florida: Oetztal, Austria (STS-59-68 seasonal change); and
Kilauea, Hawaii (3 dimensional and fringe images from STS 59-68 data).
SIR-C images for release include: Long Valley , California
(3-dimensional view); Kilauea, Hawaii (deformation map);,and possibly
Fort Irwin, California (L and C band interferogram comparisons).

</p><p>
The decision as made to extend the interferometry phase of the mission
to recapture some data takes which may have been lost due to the
malfunctioning PHRR 1. After that, the orbits will be allowed to
gradually diverge to extend the interferometry baseline. Operations
will be shut down in 18 hrs as part of the preparation for the deorbit
mission phase.


</p><p>
ANOMALIES-

</p><p>
After replacing PHRR 1 with the spare PHRR, the new PHRR 1 exhibited
high bit errors on playback. A special cross play test was conducted
at MET 009/18:56 using PHRR 1 recorded data for playback on PHRR 2.
Results were that PHRR 1 was recording properly. The cross playback
errors at 45 MHZ were, however, higher than the other recorders. This
could force some special efforts to be employed to recover the
recorded data on the ground. Use of PHRR 1 will be minimized in the
future due to this situation.

<h2>MISSION CONTROL CENTER</h2>
<p>
STS-68 Status Report #11
</p><p>
Thursday, October 6, 1994, 8 a.m. CDT

</p><p>
Endeavour's small steering jets are now back in continuous operation
and 
Space Radar Laboratory observations are continuing on schedule after

Mission Control sent a software update to the shuttle about 3:30 a.m.

today.
</p><p>

The software patch accommodated a failed temperature sensor in one of

the vernier jets and allows Endeavours onboard computers to track the

operation of the jet via a second sensor located near the failed
sensor.  
While the patch was being developed and tested in simulators,

observations by the Space Radar Laboratory continued at a reduced
pace.

</p><p>
These small jets were used only when Mission Control had solid, stable

communications with the orbiter when ground controllers could monitor

the jet firings.  The jets were turned off when communications with
the 
shuttle were unavailable or intermittent, a common occurrence during

standard shuttle operations.
</p><p>

The observations using the radar systems that were missed while the

software patch was being put in place, had been performed at least
once 
previously during the mission and are scheduled for observation again

later in the flight.  SRL scientists say the impact of the temporary

pause is minimal on the scientific investigations under way.
</p><p>

One observation completed during the night was of a controlled oil
spill 
in the North Sea designed to test the radars ability to discern oil

spills from the naturally produced film caused by fish and plankton in

the water.  In addition to the 106 gallons of diesel oil placed in the

water, 26 gallons of algae products were placed in the water nearby
for 
radar comparison.  The ground team expected to have the oil spill

cleaned up within about two hours using oil-recovery ships in the
area.
</p><p>

The experiment was conducted to prove the usefulness of radar systems
to 
more rapidly detect spills allowing quicker clean up.

The STS-68 mission remains scheduled to end on Monday with a landing

at Kennedy Space Center.  Mission managers will assess the orbiter's

consumable supplies and decide later this week if Endeavour can stay
in 
space an additional day.

</p><p>

<h2>MISSION CONTROL CENTER</h2>
<p>
STS-68 Status Report #12
</p><p>

Thursday, October 6, 1994, 5 p.m. CDT

</p><p>
Endeavour's astronauts this afternoon sent down spectacular videotape
views of
the west coast of California recorded as the shuttle passed about 115
nautical
miles overhead on its 103rd orbit. The scenes covered the San Joaquin
Valley,
San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, Los Angeles, Vandenberg Air Force
Base and
San Diego Bay.

</p><p>
During the next few days, scientists will test a new technique called
"interferometry" as the earth observations data collection continues.
The
technique is expected to yield topographic information of
unprecedented
clarity by using slightly different shuttle positions to provide
three-dimensional images of the terrain below.

</p><p>
Among the Space Radar Laboratory observations today were the North
Sea, where
scientists intentionally released small oil and algae spills to see
how well
the SRL-2 instruments could track them, as well as observations of
Bebedouro,
Brazil; the Western and Northeast Pacific Ocean; Chickasha, Oklahoma;
the Gulf
of Mexico; Ruiz, Colombia; Sena Madureira, Brazil; Weddell Sea; the
Kliuchevskoi Volcano in
Kamchatmka; Stovepipe Wells, California; and the Galapagos Islands.

</p><p>
Earlier today, the Mission Management Team extended STS-68 by one day
to allow
additional science. Endeavour is now expected to land at the Kennedy
Space
Center at about 10:36 a.m. Tuesday.

</p><p>
The orbiter continues to perform well. The only problem reported
during the
day was the failure of  a primary reaction control system jet. The jet
problem
is not expected to have any effect on the mission since the orbiter
has two
other jets thrusting in the same direction.

</p><p>
Endeavour is currently in an 118 by 115 n.m. orbit, but upcoming
maneuvers
will begin to lower the orbit to about 112 n.m. in support of the
interferometry experiments.

is from 05/06:49 to 05/21:30.  Most datatakes were
unsuccessful during this period, although efforts appear
to have been successful to obtain quality data on DT 88.2
(Kliuchevskoi April/October comparison) and DT 96.2
(North Sea intentional oil slick experiment).  As soon
as the MET clock rolls over to Day 6, we will forward
a report of datatakes acquired during the vernier anomaly.

 <h2>SIR-C/X-SAR MISSION STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD
  DAY 5: 0 HRS TO DAY 6: 0 HRS, MISSION ELAPSED TIME</h2>
<p></p>
SUMMARY- Normal data taking operations were interrupted for
approximately fourteen hours due to a malfunctioning sensor in one of
the Orbiter's vernier thrusters. The alternative attitude control
options could support degraded data taking operations, but only at a
large increase in propellant consumption. The decision was made to
suspend any attempts to take data in a routine manner, allow the
orbiter to operate in a wide attitude control dead band and take data
for super sites only. It is unlikely that the data acquired under
these conditions (ten degree dead band) are easily processable or
correctly targetted.
<p></p>
     The only exception to this strategy was a period of time when the
orbiter was operated under a new strategy that allowed operation of
the verniers, but under a very carefully managed set of conditions
that could also lead to a large use of propellant. The data acquired
under these conditions was in support of an experiment conducted by
Germany in the North Sea to measure the radar signature of different
weight and types of oils released into the North Sea under carefully
controlled and monitored conditions. This experiment had been delayed
by one day due to high wind conditions. The data were returned in real
time, processed and found to be highly useful.
<p></p>
     All told, approximately three per cent of the mission's planned
data takes were affected with significantly less impact to the science
due both to the redundant data take strategy for the mission timeline
and the possibility of operating for an eleventh day.
<p></p>
     Data processing continues to be very exciting. Scenes show very
clearly recent  mud flows from Mt. Pinatubo. Data have been acquired
which can be used to examine several other volcanoes for recent
changes. The interferometry data from the day four, Mammoth Mt.,
California data take have been processed into perspective scenes, a
high resolution Digital Elevation Model and a contour terrain map.
<p></p>
<p></p>
ANOMALIES- Several instances of tape cassette load problems were noted
in the PHRR.

STS-68 Status Report #6
</p><p>

Monday, October 3, 1994, 15 p.m. CDT
</p><p>

Endeavour's payload bay cameras sent to Earth dramatic video of the
western coast of Oregon and the length of California and the Baja
Peninsula that scientists will compare with radar images downlinked
from Space Radar Laboratory-2 instruments earlier in the flight.

</p><p>
The observations were part of a continuing effort to watch the Earth
below for evidence of environmental changes that have occurred since
the last SRL mission in April. The overall goal of the mission to
better understand the differences in changes caused by natural
processes and compare them to changes brought about by human activity.

</p><p>
Radar data was recorded today over much of the East Coast of the
United States, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Manitoba, Canada, and
French Guyana.

</p><p>
Special readings were taken with the Measurement of Air Pollution by
Satellite instrument as intentionally set fires were monitored by
scientists from the University of Iowa and the Canadian Forest
Service. The wind field and thermal evolution of the fires will be
analyzed to provide a better interpretation of carbon monoxide
emissions from the burning forest and to help calibrate color infrared
photography taken by the STS-68 crew. These fires were planned in
advance of the mission, and would have been set for forest management
purposes even if the shuttle mission were not in progress.

</p><p>
Astronauts relayed information about storms, lightning, fires and
clear cutting to the SRL science team that will be used to help
understand the radar images and MAPS data on carbon monoxide levels in
the atmosphere.

</p><p>
The Red Team -- Commander Mike Baker, Pilot Terry Wilcutt and Mission
Specialist Jeff Wisoff -- is about to hand over to the Blue Team --
Payload Commander Tom Jones and Mission Specialists Dan Bursch and
Steve Smith -- as around-the-clock observations continue.

</p><p>
There are no systems problems aboard Endeavour as the spacecraft
circles the Earth at an altitude of 119 nautical miles.

</p><p>
The start of Columbia's ferry flight from Florida to California has
been delayed until later this week.  One of the orbiter's windows will
be removed and placed on Atlantis which was found to have a tiny
scratch in one of the overhead windows.

STS-68 Status Report #7

</p><p>
Tuesday, October 4, 1994, 9 a.m. CDT

</p><p>
STS-68 crew members this morning performed two slight maneuvers to
fine-tune Endeavour's orbit to mirror its track on the first Space
Radar Laboratory mission to support a new experiment called
interferometry. 

</p><p>
The trim burns adjust the orbit to within 30 feet of where it was in
April which will allow scientists to make near identical measurements
with the radar equipment to develop a three dimensional comparison of
environmental changes during the six months separating the two
missions -- STS-59 and STS-68. 

</p><p>
Radar images over the Sahara desert and the North Atlantic will help
scientists evaluate global changes and how they affect the climates in
other areas of the world. 

</p><p>
Also today, Payload Commander Tom Jones discussed the significance of
radar systems and the Earth's environment in an interview with ABC's
Good Morning America. 

</p><p>
The STS-68 mission remains scheduled to end on Monday with a landing
at the Kennedy Space Center.  Mission managers will assess the
orbiter's consumables and decide later this week if Endeavour can stay
in space an additional day. 

</p><p>
The earlier trim burns placed Endeavour in a 117 by 115 nautical mile
orbit, circling the earth every one hour 28 minutes.  The vehicle
continues to operate in excellent shape with no systems problems being
tracked by the flight control teams in Mission Control.

STS-68 Status Report #8

</p><p>
Tuesday, October 4, 1994, 5 p.m. CDT

</p><p>
Space Radar Laboratory-2 scientists adjusted their observation plans
to take advantage of an opportunity to train their instruments on the
islands of Japan following a Tuesday night earthquake there.

</p><p>
Endeavour passed over the Sarobetsu, Japan, calibration site about
3:30 p.m. CDT, and the Synthetic Aperture Radar sent down real-time
data of the area below, allowing scientists to look for changes in the
coastline of the islands that may have been due to the large tsunami
waves associated with the quake.  The Spaceborne Imaging Radar also
recorded data on the area.

</p><p>
STS-68 crew members continued to perform slight maneuvers to fine tune
Endeavour's orbit to intersect its track on the SRL-1 mission to
support a new experiment called interferometry.  The trim burns
adjusted the orbit to within 30 feet of where it was in April as it
passed over the Mammoth Mountain, Calif., backup supersite.  This
should allow scientists to make nearly identical measurements with the
radar equipment to develop a three dimensional comparison of
environmental changes during the six months separating STS-59 and
STS-68.

</p><p>
Radar images over the Sahara desert and the North Atlantic will help
scientists evaluate global changes and how they affect the climates in
other areas of the world.  

</p><p>
Also today, Payload Commander Tom Jones discussed the significance of
radar systems and the Earth's environment in an interview with ABC's
Good Morning America.  Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff discussed the
mission with CONUS Communications Syndicate affiliates WTKR-TV in his
hometown of Norfolk, Va., and the All-News Channel in Minneapolis.

</p><p>
The STS-68 mission remains scheduled to end on Monday with a landing
at the Kennedy Space Center.  Mission managers will assess the
orbiter's consumables and decide later this week if Endeavour can stay
in space an additional day.

</p><p>
The earlier trim burns placed Endeavour in a 118 by 116 nautical mile
orbit, circling the earth every one hour 29 minutes.  The vehicle
continues to operate in excellent shape with no systems problems being
tracked by the flight control teams in Mission Control.

 <h2>SIR-C/X-SAR MISSION STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD FROM
MET DAY 3: 0 HRS TO MET DAY 4: 0 HRS</h2>
<p>
SUMMARY- Total system performance continues to be excellent. Passes
over the calibration sites show the radars to be performing very well
and consistent with the last mission. Beam alignment between the
horizontal and vertical patterns, between the X, L and C band beams is
very similar to the last mission as well.  X-SAR  has turned on the
instrument's  Automatic Gain Control (AGC)  circuit for six passes.
The AGC  feature operated as expected. Data take targeting has been
very precise, on the order of 600 feet difference from flight one to
flight two for those scenes where identical passes were planned.
</p><p>
     Forty seven SIR-C tapes have been recorded and eleven X-SAR tapes
have been recorded.  
</p><p>
     Data analysis is proceeding as planned at the processors located
at JPL, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany (DLR), JSC and Matera, Italy. The
mission-to-mission interferometry experiment has yielded two possible
sites, Mammoth and the Galapagos Islands. Data from the Galapagos pass
was successfully processed to yield  interference fringes at L band by
the JPL processor. Predicted separation between the pass on flight one
and the pass on flight two was 1200 meters. This has been
substantiated by the processing of the data. The Mammoth pass may not
yield fringes due to the very large separation. Maneuvers were planned
and executed which place the orbiter on a flight path which will
provide another set of passes with separation as little as  50 to 200
meters during data take 67.1 which will take place at the start of MET
day 4.
</p><p>
     Poor weather conditions in the North Sea (high winds) have forced
the delay of the X-SAR  oil spill experiment by one day to Thursday
morning.

STS-68 Status Report #5
</h2>

<p>
Monday, October 3, 1994, 10 a.m. Central Time
</p><p>
Endeavour's Space Radar Laboratory equipment continued to search the
Earth's land masses and oceans for environmental changes that have
occurred since the last SRL mission in April. 

</p><p>
Split into two three-member teams, the astronauts divide their time
between monitoring orbiter systems and providing assistance with the
data
acquisition by the science instruments that make up the Space Radar
Laboratory. 

</p><p>
The Red Team of Mike Baker, Terry Wilcutt and Jeff Wisoff will be on
duty
throughout much of the day while the Blue Team of Steve Smith, Dan
Bursch
and Tom Jones sleeps. 

</p><p>
Radar data gathering today included much of the East Coast of the
United
States, current patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as
other bodies of water, desert areas in Africa, and mountainous regions
around the world. 

</p><p>
Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff pinpointed storms, lightning and fires
and
relayed the information to the SRL science team.  His observations
help
correlate and corroborate data collected from the science instruments,
including the Measurement of Air Pollu tion by Satellite, which
measures
carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere. 

</p><p>
Taking such measurements on this flight helps understand changes in
the
distribution of carbon monoxide as well as other seasonal changes in
the
environment that have occurred since Endeavour's last mission in
April.

STS -68 STATUS REPORT #3
<br>

<p></p>
Saturday, October 1, 1994, 9 a.m. Central

<p></p>
Environmental studies continued throughout Saturday morning aboard
Endeavour as six astronauts working around the clock in two shifts
assisted the Space Radar Laboratory science team on the ground with
real-time observations from space. 

<p></p>
While Commander Mike Baker and Pilot Terry Wilcutt made attitude
adjustments of the orbiter to assist in precisely pointing the radar
systems, Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff provided running commentary
and
tape recording assistance for the many ground sites as Endeavour
passed
overhead at an altitude of 119 nautical miles. 

<p></p>
The STS-68 mission's three other crew members -- Steve Smith, Dan
Bursch
and Tom Jones -- perform the same duties on the opposite shift,
beginning
at about 4:30 this afternoon. 

<p></p>
Late Friday night, Tom Jones sent down some video of a volcano
erupting in
Kamchatka.  The experiment scientists reported the volcano began
erupting
a couple of weeks ago, but the latest "burst" from the Kliuchevskoi
(pronounced clue-chev-skoy) volcano occurred about eight hours after
Endeavour's 6:16 a.m. launch Friday. 

<p></p>
The SRL team is planning a series of data takes using the radar
equipment
as Endeavour moves over that area of the world. Those images will be
compared with similar radar images gathered during the STS-59 mission
in
April, prior to the volcanic activity. 

<p></p>
Other radar data gathering of the Earth's surface today included the
desert regions of Africa, both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and
mountainous regions of the East and West coasts of the United States.


<p></p>
Early Saturday, Mike Baker sent down a short video tape of smudges and
streaks he noticed shortly after launch on several of the forward
flight
deck windows.  None of the streaks would hamper visual observations
during
entry and landing slated for Monday, Oct. 10. 

<p></p>
All systems remain stable aboard Endeavour with no problems being
tracked
by the flight control teams in Mission Control.  The current orbit is
119
by 117 nautical miles. 

<p></p>
Weather conditions have delayed the start of Columbia's ferry flight
from
Florida which was planned for this weekend. The flight is not expected
before Monday at the earliest.

STS-68 STATUS REPORT #4
<br>

Sunday, October 2, 1994, 9 a.m. Central
<br>
<p>
Around the clock observations continue by Endeavour's crew in support
of 
the second mission this year dedicated to radar mapping of
environmental 
changes around the world.
</p>
<p></p>
Split into two three-member teams, the astronauts divide their time
between 
monitoring orbiter systems and providing assistance with the data
takes of 
the science instruments that make up the Space Radar Laboratory.

<p></p>
The Red Team of Mike Baker, Terry Wilcutt and Jeff Wisoff will be on
duty 
throughout much of the day while the Blue Team of Steve Smith, Dan
Bursch 
and Tom Jones rests.

<p></p>
Radar data gathering today included forest areas of North Carolina,
ocean 
current patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, desert areas in
Africa, 
and mountainous regions of the East and West coasts of the United
States.

<p></p>
There are no systems problems aboard Endeavour on its seventh mission
in 
space as the orbiter circles the Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude
of 
119 nautical miles.

<p></p>
The start of Columbia's ferry flight from Florida to California has
been 
delayed until later this week.
