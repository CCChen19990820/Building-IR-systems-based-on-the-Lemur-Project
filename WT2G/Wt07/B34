<H3>III.  THE ARKANSAS PHASE</H3>

     The Special Committee devoted considerable attention and resources to investigating allegations of improprieties in Arkansas since 1978.  The allegations fell into three broad categories:  (1) allegations concerning the Clintons' personal finances; (2) allegations concerning Governor Clinton's conduct as Governor of Arkansas; and (3) allegations concerning Mrs. Clinton's work as a Rose Law Firm attorney.  After months of exhaustive investigation into Arkansas-related matters -- including more than 100 sworn depositions and 20 days of public hearings -- the allegations of improprieties remain unsupported by the evidence.  On the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that no improprieties occurred in connection with any of these areas of inquiry.
<H4>  A.  The Loans Used to Purchase the Whitewater Property</H4>
<P>  1.  Background
<P>On August 2, 1978, the McDougals and the Clintons purchased approximately 230 acres of undeveloped land in Flippin, Arkansas from a group of local investors known as the 101 River Development Corporation.  The property was bounded on one side by Arkansas Route 101 and on the other side by the White River.  Because the White River area was popular with sportsmen, James McDougal envisioned the property as a retirement and vacation development.  He named it Whitewater Estates.
<P>The McDougals and the Clintons paid $202,611 for the Whitewater property, slightly less than $900 per acre.  They financed this purchase with two loans: a loan for $182,611 from the Citizens Bank and Trust of Flippin ("Citizens Bank") and a $20,000 loan from Union National Bank of Little Rock ("Union National").  It has been alleged that the Clintons and the McDougals received special treatment from Citizens Bank and Union National due to the fact that  Clinton was the Arkansas Attorney General and a candidate for Governor when the loan was made.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that the loans did not receive special treatment.
<P>  2.  The Citizens Bank Loan
<P>As noted above, the Clintons and McDougals borrowed $182,611.20 from Citizens Bank on August 2, 1978 to purchase the Whitewater property.  The loan was a six month demand note bearing interest at 10%  This loan was renewed and extended nine times before being repaid in full on May 12, 1992.
<P>Frank Burge, Robert Ritter and James Patterson -- the most senior officials at Citizens Bank at or about the time the loan made -- all testified that the loan received no special treatment.*   Citizens Bank routinely made real estate loans for the development of unimproved land -- such as Whitewater Estates.  Patterson testified that Citizens Bank "was a heavy real estate lender"1 and that the bank had made loans to other developers who bought tracts of land in the 200-acre range and then subdivided the land for resale.2   In fact, the bank sometimes provided 100 percent financing for real estate investments similar to Whitewater Estates.**  
<P>There was no special treatment in the decision to approve the loan.  Burge testified that:
<P>to be quite candid with you, I don't think Bill Clinton added one real big impact point in the approval of that loan.  The approval of that loan was basically that . . .  if the loan had problems, McDougal had ample resources, cash flow-wise, to service that debt for any purpose, that Clinton added to the loan the basic character, that I just didn't believe . . . that a sitting governor would let a loan go in default and be foreclosed on.3
Burge testified that the Clinton/McDougal loan was approved because, at that time McDougal was a "prominent" real estate developer who "had proven his ability to borrow money and repay the debt in a timely fashion," and who had had "success in remarketing property."  Moreover, Burge testified that the Citizens Bank board believed that Attorney General Clinton had the financial ability to discharge the loan or service the debt.4  Similarly, Patterson testified that, "We gave no preference to that loan" and "they were treated exactly like any other customer."5  Patterson later added, "This was just the most ultimate, normal deal in the world."6  Ritter was not told by his board of directors to handle the loan differently than he might have handled other loans.7<P>  The evidence also established that the loan carried standard terms and conditions for Citizens Bank loans.  First, the interest rate for the loan (and the subsequent renewals) was consistent with the market rate in Arkansas at the time.  According to Ritter, "All of [the loans] were at the limit of usury at that time,"8 which was 10 percent.   Second, a six-month demand note was consistent with the Citizens Bank loan portfolio.9  Ritter testified that the notes were short-term and demandable
<P>probably because of the opportunity to renew all of them at the time of usury changes in Arkansas.  So when that would have occurred, and it did, then it was a matter of renewing all those notes at a higher rate.  Basically, the whole portfolio looked of that nature, with six-month renewal notes or six month notes or one-year notes.10  
<P>
In other words, Citizens Bank insisted upon short term loans to maximize its potential interest income.  Borrowers -- including the McDougals and the Clintons -- would have preferred longer terms, but the bank did not offer them.  
<P>Finally, there was nothing unusual about the performance of the loan.  When asked if other loans performed better than the Whitewater loan, Burge said, "I wouldn't say it was better.  I think it was difficult as well for those other people.  During that period of time of those first few years, interest rates went to 21 percent and it was a struggle for all of them."11
<P>Citizens Bank anticipated repayment of the loan from proceeds of Whitewater Estates land sales.  According to Burge, "we anticipated that they would had ample cash sales and ample contract and deed sales to discharge the debt in a timely fashion."12  Burge explained that, "I looked for the land sales to be the primary source of payment.  And I would be safe to say that the secondary source of repayment would have been  McDougal."  He also noted that James McDougal was the borrower "with the deep pockets."13  Moreover, Burge said that "I would assume that we would have made the loan to  McDougal on a stand-alone basis."14  Patterson also testified that the bank expected to be repaid out of the proceeds of subsequent resale of the property.15  Burge testified that he believed "McDougal has ample resources, cash flow-wise, to service that debt for any purpose."16
<P>In sum, according to Burge, the Citizens Bank loan to the McDougals and Clintons was "a normal deal"17 made on the "exact same terms we made to every borrower."18
<P> 3.  The Union National Bank Loan
<P>On June 19, 1978, Attorney General Clinton and James McDougal borrowed $20,000 from Union National.  The loan was a one-year unsecured demand note with an interest rate of 10 percent.  Union National extended the loan three times between June and December 1979.  With each extension, the interest rate rose: first from 10% to 10.5% in June 1979; then from 10.5% to 11.5% in September 1979; and finally from 11.5% to 13% in December 1979.  The loan was repaid in full on June 23, 1980.*
<P>The allegation has been made that Attorney General Clinton solicited the loan and that he received special treatment.  The evidence, however, does not support this allegation.  Union National Vice President Paul Berry testified that he approached Attorney General Clinton about borrowing the money after Clinton stated that he was considering purchasing land near the White River.  Berry testified that "I discussed whether or not [Clinton and James McDougal] were going to [buy the property] and I said if you make the decision to do so, we would like to -- it would be my guess that we would like to make that loan."19  Berry described this statement as a "routine remark" that he made to potential customers to generate business for the Union National.20   In contrast to claims that Attorney General Clinton sought the Union National loan,  Berry's testimony demonstrates that the bank solicited Clinton's loan business.
<P>Berry further testified that Attorney General Clinton and James McDougal received no special treatment regarding the loan.  Berry described the loan as "relatively small,"21  and noted that Union National routinely provided similar unsecured loans under the "prestige banking" program, which served as a marketing device to encourage young professionals to conduct business with the bank.22  Moreover, Clinton and McDougal already had accounts with the bank at the time of the loan, and Berry recalled that McDougal already was a loan customer.
<P>Following his conversation with Attorney General Clinton, Berry went to the chief lending officer Don Denton to discuss a possible loan:
<P>I was in the main lobby at this point and Mr. Denton's office was in -- just off the main lobby on the same floor and I routinely spoke to members of the loan department about customers that I had solicited their business (sic), and in the course of the conversation, if they mentioned a credit need, as part of my duties, I reported such credit needs for existing or potential customers to the loan department.  And I mentioned this to Mr. Denton or -- and I am sure I apprised him of this potential credit need.23
<P>
Denton has claimed that he was pressured by senior bank officials to make the loan to Clinton.  Berry, however, testified that he did not order Denton -- a high ranking official at the bank -- to make the loan, nor did he convey any message from the bank's president about the loan.24  Berry simply believed that making the loan was "good business" for the bank,25 which then earned most of its profits from the loans.  Finally, Denton's actions at the time of the loan are not consistent with his recent allegations.  Denton never expressed any objections about the loan.  Berry was unaware that Denton had any reservations about the loan, and Denton testified that he never voiced any concerns or objections about the loan to bank officials or during loan committee meetings.26  Denton testified that if he had attended the officers' loan review committee meeting at which the McDougal-Clinton loan was discussed, he would have "raised some questions," but admitted that "I probably would have taken no action beyond asking questions."27
<P>There is no question that Union National anticipated repayment of loan.  Denton testified Union National wanted to make a profit and expected loans -- including those made to top political officials in the state -- to be repaid.28  He assumed that the bank expected Clinton and McDougal to repay their Union National loan and he noted that the loan was in fact repaid in full.29  
<P>Union Bank was a national bank, and therefore not subject to state banking regulation.30  Denton also testified that neither the Attorney General31 nor the Governor32 had any direct regulatory role over the bank.  Thus, Union National had no reason to fear retaliation from Clinton, as either Attorney General or Governor, for refusing to approve or renew the loan or requiring repayment.
<P> 4.  The Clintons were passive investors in Whitewater
<P>The testimony of Citizens Bank and Union National officials demonstrated that the Clintons were passive investors in the Whitewater project.  The senior banking officials who authorized or managed the loan had little, if any, contact with the Clintons.
<P>Burge testified that he dealt primarily with James McDougal and viewed him as the "primary partner . . . the one that seemed to be knowledgeable of all facets of each of the partners."33  He added that "it was always my contention and understanding that McDougal was handling that transaction.  He was the, if you will, point person or the conduit that all information and correspondence was channelled through."34  Burge received all financial information from James McDougal.35  Burge had no contact with Mrs. Clinton and dealt with Attorney General Clinton only on one occasion: when Clinton authorized Burge to answer media inquiries regarding the loan.36 
<P>Ritter dealt primarily with James McDougal because he was "a fellow banker" and was the easiest to reach of the group.37  Ritter could not recall the Clintons ever calling him directly about the status of the loan.38  Patterson could not recall ever meeting the Clintons, although he recalled that James McDougal had come to the bank on several occasions and was in the area while the land was being developed.39  Denton dealt solely with McDougal and never communicated with Governor Clinton about the Union Bank loan.40
<P>The bankers' testimony is consistent with the Clintons' interrogatory responses to the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1995.  President Clinton, for example, recalled signing for the Citizens Bank and Union National loans.41  He has testified, however, that the Clintons did not visit Whitewater Estates before they bought the property with the McDougals,42 that "the books and records of the project were kept by the McDougals," that the Clintons "relied upon the McDougals to tell us when we needed to make a financial contribution to the venture,"43 and that the Clintons "relied upon the McDougals to conduct or supervise sales and marketing" of the lots.44  Similarly, Mrs. Clinton stated that: 
<P>the McDougals exercised control over the management and operation of [Whitewater Development Corporation] for the period of its active existence.  My husband and I did not receive annual reports or regular financial summaries and were not informed of all actions taken in the name of [Whitewater Development Corporation].  As was contemplated from the inception of the venture, we were passive investors and relied upon the McDougals to manage and operate it.45

<P>The Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report concluded that the Clintons did not play an active role in the activities connected with the real estate development.  The report states in part that:
<P>For the relevant period (ending in 1986), the evidence suggests that the McDougals and not the Clintons managed Whitewater.  The evidence does not suggest that the Clintons had managerial control over the enterprise, or received annual reports or regular financial summaries.  Instead, and as the Clintons suggest, their main contact with Whitewater seems to have consisted of signing loan extensions or renewals.46
<P>
Moreover, after listing every document the Clintons had been provided in connection with the Whitewater investment, the Pillsbury report concluded that, "on this record, there is no basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything of substance about the McDougals' advances to Whitewater, the source of the funds used to make those advances or the sources of the funds used to make payments on the bank debt."47  Bruce Ericson, a primary author of the Pillsbury report, accepted Mrs. Clinton's statement that the Clintons "`had little knowledge [of] and no control over the Whitewater project.'"48

<H3>  B.  The Extensions of the Loans</H3>

<P> After the Clintons and McDougals incorporated Whitewater Development Company, Inc. ("WWDC") in June 1979, they transferred the land to the corporation, subject to the Citizens Bank mortgage.  By the end of 1984 Citizens Bank had renewed or extended the loan six times.  In 1985, however, Twin City Bankshares ("TCB"), a bank holding company that had purchased Citizens Bank, transformed it into First Ozark National Bank.  Thereafter, Whitewater loan renewals were handled by First Ozark.  First Ozark also renewed the loan several times.  In all Citizens Bank  and First Ozark renewed or extended the loan nine times before it was paid off on May 12, 1992. 
<P>The Committee devoted considerable attention to the First Ozark loan renewals in 1987 and 1988.  In particular, the Committee explored: (1) whether the loan received special treatment; and (2) whether the loan renewals were connected in any way to banking legislation enacted by the State of Arkansas in 1987 and 1988 that may have benefitted First Ozark's parent company, Twin City Bankshares.  
<P>The evidence demonstrated that the Whitewater loan did not receive any special treatment.  The loan was fully collateralized and was personally guaranteed by the Clintons and the McDougals.  In addition, beginning in 1985, the bank received all income from lot sales.  Also, although these two loan renewals (out of the total of nine renewals) occurred about the same time as the banking legislation, the evidence demonstrated that there was no connection between the loan renewals and the banking legislation.
<P> 1.  Extension of Loan by Citizens Bank
<P>Citizens Bank Assistant Vice President Ron Proctor assumed responsibility for the Whitewater loan when he joined the bank in 1983.*  By then, the loan already had been renewed or extended several times, and the loan balance had been reduced from more than $182,000 to approximately $125,000.  The loan was structured as a single pay loan.  No payments were due during the term of the loan; however, a balloon payment including accrued interest was due when the loan matured.  This loan structure was common for commercial loans in Arkansas at that time.49  Arkansas usury statutes capped interest rates below the market rate for long term commercial loans.50  As such, banks commonly made short term loans that were renewed at new interest rates reflecting changes in market conditions.
<P>From the time Proctor became involved, the Whitewater loan was secured by the land.  In addition, the Clintons and McDougals were personally responsible for the loan.  Proctor therefore considered First Ozark to be well protected.51  As such, the loan was routinely extended in October 1983 and renewed in December 1984 (at which point the balance had been reduced to approximately $100,000).52  The 1984 renewal was for two years, until December 3, 1986.  
<P><P>a.  Ozark Air's purchase of the Whitewater property
<P>On May 4, 1985, Chris Wade's Ozark Air Service purchased all the unsold Whitewater land.  When Wade informed Proctor of the purchase, he asked Proctor to assign the loan to him and to release the Clintons and McDougals.*  Proctor testified he was pleased that Wade had purchased the land.  Wade was a local real estate businessman, and Proctor though he might be able to sell the lots faster than McDougal.53  Wade also had served on the board of Citizens Bank.  Proctor had the impression that the Clintons and McDougals wanted to withdraw from the Whitewater investment, and that Wade was helping them do so.54  Proctor's first concern was the bank, however; accordingly, he refused to release the Clintons or the McDougals from their personal liability until the loan was paid in full.55  This conflicts with any claim that the bank gave the Clintons special treatment.  On the contrary, the bank declined to release the Clintons from personal liability for the loan even though Wade was prepared to assume that liability after he purchased the property.
<P><P>b.  The 1987 loan renewal
<P>When the Whitewater loan matured in December 1986, the McDougals again sought to renew the loan.  At this point, the loan balance had been reduced to approximately $53,000.56  The Clintons were not involved in renewing the Whitewater loan at this time;*  Proctor's primary contact on the loan was Susan McDougal.57  
<P>As the loan officer responsible for the Whitewater loan, Proctor was required to review the loan renewal application and make a recommendation.  As part of this review process, Proctor decided to reevaluate the collateral for the loan, the Whitewater property, which had not been appraised since the original loan was made in 1978.58  To do so, Proctor visited the Whitewater property in January 1987.  According to Proctor's file notes dated January 6, 1987, he valued the land at $750 per acre.59  This was less than the original appraisal of $1,100 per acre, due in part to the ill-kept condition of the property.**  The reduced valuation was Proctor's best informed estimate.  He had no technical training in appraisal.60  A formal appraisal was not prepared.***
<P>Proctor testified that although he would have preferred that the value of the land had not declined over the life of the loan, he was not concerned about repayment because the loan did not really depend on the collateral.61  The escrow payments that the bank was receiving were adequate and the loan also was guaranteed by the Clintons and the McDougals.  Proctor therefore assigned the loan a risk rating of 3 (out of 6).62  
<P>It has been alleged that a risk rating of 3 was unusual, and meant "the bank should start preparing for a default, but still hoped the loan would perform."63   Proctor and First Ozark President Wes Strange both testified that this was incorrect.64  First, a 3 rating did not signify potential default.  On the contrary, Proctor stated that a 3 rating signified a "standard loan with normal risk."65  Strange agreed that a risk rating of 3 signified a "normal loan."66  He explained that:  "A 3-rated loan was a standard acceptable credit in the bank with no particular problem."67  Even Vernon Dewey -- the junior bank officer who made that allegation -- ultimately conceded that a 3 rating was in the "middle of the rating scale," and did not signify a loan that was about to go into default.68  Second, a risk rating of 3 was common, not unusual.  Proctor estimated that 80% or 85% of the bank's loans were risk rated 3.69  Strange described Proctor's estimate as "very close."70  In fact, every commercial loan approved on January 8, 1987 (the day the Whitewater loan renewal was approved) was assigned a risk rating of 3.71  
<P>First Ozark's officers loan committee held its regular weekly meeting on January 8, 1987.  The attendees included Proctor, Strange, and Dewey.  Susan Sisk, TCB's representative on the loan committee, did not attend.72
<P>Fourteen loans were considered at the meeting.  The Whitewater loan renewal was one of eight commercial loans on the agenda.  Based on Proctor's recommendation, the committee approved the loan renewal.73  Once again, this demonstrates that the Whitewater loan did not receive special treatment.  Although the minutes do not state who supported the renewal, a single negative vote would have caused the loan to be declined.74  Therefore, the loan presumably received approval.*  
<P>Although the loan committee approved the loan on January 8, 1987, the actual renewal was subject to three conditions:  
<P>1.  All sales proceeds (less commissions) applied to note.
<P>2.  All contracts to be maintained here at [First Ozark National Bank].
<P>3.  Need new financials.75
<P>
Although the loan's fundamentals were adequate for renewal, the bank would not finalize the loan until it was further protected.
<P>The committee's conditions were met before the loan was formally renewed on March 26, 1987.  First, the renewed loan included an assignment of escrow in the bank's favor.  As such, payments from sales were made into an escrow account, and the proceeds of the escrow account were pledged and paid to the bank.  Second, the sales contracts were provided to First Ozark.  Finally, the Clintons submitted an updated financial statement on March 24, 1987, which First Ozark received on March 26, 1987.* 
<P>The loan had a twelve month term and carried a interest rate of 10.5% -- the same rate carried by every other loan approved at the meeting on January 8, 1987.76  As noted above, all eight of the commercial loans approved that day had risk ratings of 3.77
<P><P>c.  The Clintons' March 24, 1987 Financial Statement
<P>The circumstances under which the bank obtained the Clintons' financial statement have been the subject of considerable attention.  Proctor and Twin City Bank president Ed Penick both testified that they attended a First Ozark board meeting at which the bank's desire to obtain the Clintons' financial statement was discussed.78  Proctor does not recall how the subject arose.79  Penick recalls that the Whitewater loan was on a list of loans with file documentation deficiencies.80  The board routinely reviewed such lists.81  
<P>During the foregoing discussion, Penick offered to help procure a financial statement.*  Specifically, Penick said he would speak with Margaret Davenport (now Margaret Eldridge) -- a Twin City Bank officer who was friendly with Mrs. Clinton -- and ask her to speak with Mrs. Clinton.82  Penick then wrote to Mrs. Clinton and enclosed a form financial statement.83  Penick, however, does not recall speaking with Davenport.84  Davenport similarly testified that she did not speak with Penick or with Mrs. Clinton.85  However, a handwritten note on Mrs. Clinton's stationery references "Notes of Tk w/ M. Davenport."  The note -- which is dated "1987" in the upper right hand corner -- recounts the status of the Whitewater loan as of October 1986.86  Thus, Davenport may have spoken with Mrs. Clinton regarding the Whitewater loan, but has since forgotten having done so.
<P>In any event, on March 26, 1987, the bank received a financial statement for the Clintons.  The statement -- which is dated March 24, 1987 -- appears to be a form supplied by the bank.87<P>  The Committee devoted considerable attention to the Clintons' financial statements.  Much of the Committee's inquiry tracked allegations in Blood Sport.  First, the book made much of the fact that the bank approved the 1984 Whitewater loan renewal without an updated financial statement for the Clintons, and that the bank gave preliminary approval to the 1987 renewal before it received a financial statement.  In particular, the book cites Dewey for the proposition that the Whitewater loan was "the only one in the bank's portfolio" that lacked fully updated financial statements, and suggests that this represents special treatment for the Clintons.88  
<P>The evidence, however, simply does not support the suggestion of favoritism.  As an initial matter, Proctor estimated that 40% of the loans in First Ozark's portfolio lacked fully updated financial statements from the borrowers.89  Penick and Strange agreed that it was not unusual for a loan to lack fully updated financial statements.90  Moreover, when confronted with Proctor's testimony, Dewey conceded that "it was not the only loan in the bank lacking financial information but this loan sticks out in my mind because of who the borrowers were."91
<P>Similarly, Blood Sport reported that Dewey was so troubled by the lack of updated financial statements that he "insisted that the matter be brought to the bank's board of directors, and argued that the loan should be called."92  Once again, this raises the implication that the bank afforded special treatment to the Clintons.  This statement also was at odds with the evidence.  Dewey testified that he never argued to the board of directors that the loan should be called; in fact, he never told a single director -- during a meeting or elsewhere -- that the loan should be called.93  Proctor was the only person whom Dewey recalled telling that the loan should be called, and Proctor denied that Dewey did so.94  
<P>Moreover, Proctor testified that financial statements were less significant with respect to the Whitewater loan than many other loans.95  Unlike many other loans at the time, the Whitewater loan was performing; the balance already had been reduced from $182,000 to $52,000.  Also, the bank had ample security for the loan because it was receiving payments from an escrow fund and the loan was secured by the land itself (as well as the personal liability of the McDougals and the Clintons).96  Thus, the bank did not need the Clinton's updated financial statement to analyze the loan.
<P>Second, it was suggested in Blood Sport that the bank made repeated efforts to procure a financial statement, which were ignored by the Clintons.  In particular, the book asserts that Dewey stated that he had "written the Clintons repeatedly asking, then demanding, that they provide a financial disclosure."97  Under oath, however, Dewey conceded that he never wrote to the Clintons or communicated with them in any way on any subject.98  Nor did Proctor contact the Clintons directly at this time.99  In fact, the only person who recalls having contacted the Clintons directly was Penick, who sent Mrs. Clinton a blank Twin City Bank financial form shortly before the Clintons submitted such a form on March 24, 1987.100
<P>In any event, there was no reason for the Clintons to avoid submitting a financial statement to First Ozark.  The Clintons previously had submitted financial statements to First Ozark and other banks that identified and valued their Whitewater investment.  Governor Clinton also had submitted state-mandated financial disclosure forms that identified the Whitewater investment.
<P>Finally, the Clintons' valuation of the Whitewater investment on their financial statement has been the subject of substantial discussion, particularly in Blood Sport.  According to the book, Whitewater "[c]uriously" is not referred to by name in the assets portion of the document, but the Clintons listed two assets that may refer to Whitewater:  $50,000 in accounts receivable and a partial interest in real estate valued at $50,000.101  It therefore concluded that the valued their Whitewater investment at $100,000.*
<P>The book then challenged the accuracy of this valuation.  As noted earlier, in 1985, the unsold Whitewater lots had been conveyed to Chris Wade's Ozark Air.  Wade still owed WWDC approximately $25,500 in that transaction, of which the Clintons were due half, or $12,750.  In addition, the Clintons owned half of Whitewater's $60,000 in accounts receivable from before the sale to Wade; approximately $30,000.  Thus, Blood Sport concludes that the Clintons' share of Whitewater was worth a total of approximately $42,750 -- less than half of the $100,000 value the Clintons supposedly assigned to the property.102
<P>Apparently, Stewart reviewed only the first page of the two page financial statement.**  The second page of the financial statement lists Whitewater as an asset valued at $100,000,103 but it also lists the Clintons' portion of the Whitewater loan as a $70,000 liability.  Thus, the net valuation of the Whitewater investment on the financial statement is actually $30,000 -- less than the $42,750 value that Blood Sport calculated.  Consequently, it appears that the Clintons may actually have undervalued their Whitewater investment.104  In any event, the whole issue is spurious because the bank already had complete information about both the value of the assets and the amount of the liabilities associated with Whitewater.  They only needed a completed form for their loan files, and they were not looking to that form for information about a loan they had made which was collateralized by property they had inspected.
<P>Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that the Clintons intentionally misrepresented the value.  David Kendall has described the valuations as the Clintons' "best estimate."  In this regard, it should be noted that $100,000 is approximately half of the original purchase price for the Whitewater property.  In any event, the Clintons were consistent in their valuation of Whitewater.  As noted previously, in the First Ozark financial statement, the Clintons value their Whitewater investment at approximately $100,000.105  A financial statement that the Clintons provided to Security Bank of Paragould about the same time assigns a similar value to the Whitewater investment.106  So does a financial statement submitted to the Bank of Cherry Valley in April 1983.107  Thus, it appears that the Clintons simply assigned the same value to their Whitewater investment that they had always assigned to it.*
<P><P>d.  The 1988 Renewal
<P>On November 20, 1987, about midway through the term of the 1987 renewal, Proctor wrote to Susan McDougal to request an updated financial statement for the McDougals.108  As the loan approached maturity, he repeated the request by letter dated February 24, 1988, this time requesting an updated statement for the Clintons also.109  The McDougals apparently did not respond to either letter.**
<P>On April 12, 1988, Wes Strange wrote to Mrs. Clinton about renewing the Whitewater loan.110  This was a change in procedure; previously, the bank had worked through the McDougals.  By this time, however, the McDougals had left Arkansas and moved to California.111  First Ozark's efforts to locate them had proved unsuccessful.  Strange thus sought Mrs. Clinton's help in contacting the McDougals.112
<P>Mrs. Clinton made several attempts to contact the McDougals.  On June 9, 1988, she sent them a certified letter recounting her efforts to reach Mrs. McDougal, and asking them to contact her to discuss the loan extension.  In a "Blind P.S." to Strange, Mrs. Clinton added:  "Wes, I do not know what else to do.  If you have any suggestions, please give me a call.  Thanks."113  By July 13, 1988, Mrs. Clinton apparently had given up trying to reach the McDougals.  She wrote to Strange:  "I am enclosing the renewal note you sent for Bill's and my signature.  Despite repeated efforts, I have been unable to reach the McDougals."114
<P>On July 15, 1988, Proctor prepared a request for waiver of financial statements for WWDC and the guarantors -- that is, the Clintons and McDougals.  In his request, Proctor explained that statements were not necessary because:
<P>1)<P>Payments on loan are derived from escrow contracts controlled by [First Ozark National Bank]; and 
<P>2)<P>Collateral is sufficient to cover the loan.

The request for a loan documentation waiver was approved by Strange.115
<P>According to Proctor, his request for a loan documentation waiver was not unusual.116  By this time, the loan balance had been paid down to approximately $36,000.117  Moreover, the loan was supported by an income stream from the escrow account and was collateralized by the land.  In addition, the waiver request reflected the bank's recognition that the McDougals could not be found.*  In any event, First Ozark did not relieve the Clintons or McDougals of liability for the loan; the bank merely waived a paperwork requirement.118  
<P>Also on July 15, 1988, Proctor approved the renewal of the Whitewater loan for 39 months.  Strange also approved the renewal.119  Because the loan amount was only $36,000, the loan did not require further approval.
<P>On July 19, 1988, Strange forwarded the renewal note to Mrs. Clinton for signing.120  On July 27, 1988, Mrs. Clinton returned the renewal note signed by her and the Governor to Strange.121
<P> 3.  Branch Banking Legislation
<P>Until 1987, a state-chartered bank in Arkansas could operate branches only in the community in which it was chartered.  Savings and loans had no such restriction.  Legislation enacted in 1987 and 1988 broadened opportunities for state-chartered banks to operate branches outside their immediate communities.  Twin City Bankshares ("TCB"), the parent company of First Ozark National Bank, supported the 1987 and 1988 legislation.  It has been suggested that a relationship existed between First Ozark's renewal of the Whitewater loan in 1987 and 1988 and the Clinton Administration's support for branch banking legislation.  There is no evidence to support this allegation.  The only connection between the Whitewater loan renewals and the branch banking legislation was a coincidence of timing.

<P><P>a.  Act 539 of 1987
<P>By 1986, opposition to the geographic restriction on state-chartered banks in Arkansas was growing.  For example, on May 27, 1986, TCB's president Ed Penick met with State Bank Commissioner Marlin Jackson to discuss TCB's application to open new branches in North Little Rock, the community in which it was chartered.122  According to Penick's file notes:
<P>The Commissioner also mentioned that, in his opinion, it was time for somebody to foster legislation to permit county-wide branching.  The legislation could be restricted to counties with over 100,000 population so that only Pulaski County would be affected.  He felt there was a good chance the legislation would be approved.  . . .  

<P>It would be interesting to casually feel out our state delegation to determine if there would be support for county-wide branching, but I'm not too optimistic here either knowing the influence of [State Senator] Max Howell and the close association he has with Pat Wilson.123

This memorandum demonstrates that the Clinton Administration supported branch banking legislation long before the 1987 Whitewater loan renewal.  The memorandum also shows that the Clinton Administration proposed branch banking legislation to TCB; TCB did not propose the legislation to the administration.  TCB may have favored the idea, but the Clinton Administration's interest preceded the maturity of the Whitewater loan by six months.  Thus, it is implausible that the Governor's support for the legislation was connected to the loan renewal in any way.
<P>In any event, on April 1, 1987, the Arkansas Legislature passed Act 539, which permitted state-chartered banks in counties with populations greater than 200,000 to operate branches virtually anywhere in their county.  The only limitation was that a bank could not open a branch within 300 feet of the main branch of another bank.124  Act 539 passed overwhelmingly:  80 to 10 in the House and 23 to 10 in the Senate.
<P>At the time, only one Arkansas county had a population greater than 200,000; Pulaski County, which contains Little Rock and North Little Rock.  Although the Act permitted any bank in Pulaski County to expand outside its immediate community, as a practical matter, there was less incentive for Little Rock banks to expand outside the city than for banks outside Little Rock to expand into the city.  
<P>Twin City Banks -- which was owned by Twin City Bankshares -- was the largest state-chartered bank in Arkansas.  It also was the only major bank chartered in North Little Rock.  It has been suggested that a connection existed between First Ozark's renewal of the Whitewater loan in March 1987 and the passage of Act 539 in April 1987.125  There is no evidence to support this allegation.  On the contrary, every single witness has denied any connection between the loan renewal and Act 539.*  Ron Proctor saw "no connection at all between the two"126, and Penick when it was suggested to him at a hearing that there was a "quid pro quo for support of the banking legislation" said "absolutely not."127  Therefore, the evidence demonstrated no connection between the renewal of the Whitewater loan in 1987 and the enactment of Act 539.
<P><P>b.  The Omnibus Banking Bill of 1988
<P>Notwithstanding the passage of Act 539, TCB's efforts to open new branches encountered opposition.  Most significantly, TCB's main competitor, First Commercial Bank, sued to overturn five permits that Bank Commissioner Bill Ford granted TCB to open branches in Little Rock.  First Commercial claimed that the Act constituted unconstitutional "local" legislation because it affected only Pulaski County.128
<P>While the litigation was pending, a federal court in Mississippi overturned a regulatory system similar to that in Arkansas (in which S&Ls could branch statewide, but federally-chartered and state-chartered banks could not).129  In essence, the court compelled Mississippi to permit federally-chartered banks to branch statewide, which gave them a significant competitive advantage over state-chartered banks -- and threatened Mississippi's dual charter system.130  
<P>At the time, Arkansas also had a dual charter system.  The Mississippi decision thus raised alarm among bankers and regulators that Arkansas would face a similar suit.  To prevent judicial intervention, the banking community put together a comprehensive overhaul of the State's banking laws called the Omnibus Banking Bill of 1988.131  This bill was introduced and enacted during a special legislative session that Governor Clinton called in July 1988.  Among other reforms, the Omnibus Bill authorized statewide branching by state-chartered banks.  This provision replaced Act 539 and rendered First Commercial's litigation moot.
<P>Again, the only connection between the Omnibus Banking Bill of 1988 and First Ozark's renewal of the Whitewater loan is a coincidence of timing.  The 1988 legislation was enacted on July 15, 1988, the same day that First Ozark waived the documentation requirement for the Whitewater loan and four days before the loan was renewed.  However, no witness has testified to any knowledge of a connection between these events.  In fact, every single witness has denied that a connection exists.  
<P>Wayne Hartsfield, President of the Arkansas Bankers Association and the person who coordinated the drafting of the 1988 legislation, testified that he had no reason to believe the 1988 legislation was unduly influenced by TCB or any other bank.132  Hartsfield stated that the bill's provisions were the product of a consensus among bank chief executives, and that he had no reason to believe that TCB had any special influence with the Governor or his staff.133  There is no evidence to the contrary.

<H3>  C.  Subsequent Events Related to the Whitewater Property</H3>
<P> 1.  The Lot 13 Loan
<P>The Majority raised questions about a loan to Mrs. Clinton from Madison Bank and Trust ("MBT"), previously known as the Bank of Kingston, when she borrowed $30,000 to build a model home on Whitewater Estates lot 13.  The Majority has alleged that this loan violated a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") restriction on MBT loans outside the bank's designated loan territory.*  The evidence did not support this allegations.
<P>MBT President Gary Bunch testified that there was nothing unusual about the terms of Mrs. Clinton's loan.  The amount of the loan, $30,000, was not unusually large for the bank at that time.134  Mrs. Clinton's loan was a demand note, like "90 percent or more" of MBT's loans at that time.135   Moreover, MBT obviously was not providing Mrs. Clinton with special treatment by setting an interest rate of 20 percent for the loan.136  
<P>Bunch also testified that there was nothing unusual about the fact that Mrs. Clinton lived outside MBT's loan territory.  MBT made numerous out-of-territory loans in addition to Mrs. Clinton's loan.137  In addition, the FDIC, MBT's federal regulator, expressly permitted MBT to make out-of-territory loans under certain conditions.138  There is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton's loan was not in compliance with those conditions.139   Moreover, even if Mrs. Clinton's loan were in violation of the FDIC order -- which has not been demonstrated -- there is no reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton knew or should have known of any regulatory violation.140  The cease and desist order was a confidential agreement between the bank and the FDIC, and MBT officials did not disclose the terms of the order to the bank's borrowers.141<P>  Furthermore, there is no evidence of irregularities in connection with the extension of credit to Mrs. Clinton.  Bunch refuted allegations that the Clintons ever refused to provide any information to MBT.142  According to Bunch, any absence of proper loan documentation in the loan file was the fault of the bank, not the Clintons.143   In short, there is nothing to suggest that Mrs. Clinton ever received any special treatment with respect to this loan.
<P> 2.  The Clintons' Sale of Their Interest in Whitewater Development Corporation
<P>On December 22, 1992, James McDougal bought the Clintons' remaining interest in WWDC for $1,000.144   By this time, WWDC had sold all of its remaining lots and had no prospect of ever becoming a profitable enterprise.*  Because McDougal had become destitute, Jim Blair, General Counsel for Tysons Foods, loaned McDougal $1,000 to his longtime friend to complete the transaction.145  Blair did not inform the Clintons that he loaned this money to McDougal, and there is no evidence that the Clintons were aware of the loan at that time.146

<H3>  D.  Whitewater Tax Issues</H3>
<P>The Special Committee conducted a limited review of matters pertaining to the Clintons' treatment of the Whitewater investment on their personal income tax returns and to the corporate tax filings of Whitewater Development Company, Inc.  The Committee's review of these matters, while not exhaustive, was sufficient to establish that (1) the Clintons' tax treatment of the Whitewater investment on their personal tax returns was appropriate based upon the limited information about the investment that they received and (2) the information about the investment they received was, in many instances, incomplete or incorrect, which resulted in some  unintentional errors in the Clintons' personal tax returns.  As discussed below, these conclusion are consistent with findings of other investigations of the Whitewater investment, particularly the Pillsbury Madison & Sutro investigation (discussed in this report below) and the review of Whitewater accounting and tax matters conducted for the Clintons by Denver attorney James M. Lyons in March 1992.
<P> 1.  Background
<P>As discussed above, the McDougals and the Clintons funded the August 1978 purchase of the Whitewater property with two bank loans.  The $182,611.20 Citizens Bank & Trust loan was secured by a first mortgage on the Whitewater property and was executed by Mr. and Mrs. McDougal and Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, all four of whom were personally obligated to repay the loan.147  The $20,000 Union National Bank loan was an unsecured personal loan to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton.148  The proceeds from these two loans were used to purchase the Whitewater property.149  The property was deeded to the McDougals and the Clintons, as individuals, and a deed was recorded in the Marion County, Arkansas, land title records reflecting that the McDougals and the Clintons were the owners of the property.150
<P>In June 1979 Charles James, the accountant who kept the books for Whitewater and other real estate developments controlled by James McDougal,151 incorporated Whitewater Development Company, Inc. (hereinafter "WWDC" or "the corporation").152  On September 30, 1979, the McDougals and the Clintons deeded all 230 acres of the Whitewater property to the corporation.153  The bank loans that had been used to acquire the property were not assumed by the corporation.  Those loans remained in the names of the McDougals and the Clintons, and they remained personally and individually obligated to repay those loans.154
<P> 2.  The Clintons Interest Deductions for Interest Payments They Made on the Whitewater Loans

<P>From 1978 until 1986 the business affairs of the Whitewater development were managed by James and Susan McDougal, assisted by Charles James.155  The Clintons made some interest payments on the Whitewater bank loans out of their personal funds and claimed deductions on their personal tax returns for those payments.*  The Clintons claimed the following deductions
for interest payments on the Whitewater loans that they made out of their personal funds:
<PRE>
                    1978                    $10,131*      
                    1979**                  $11,753
                    1980                    $13,350         </PRE>  
    <P> In addition to the interest payments on the land acquisition loans, the Clintons made interest payments on a personal loan relating to the model home on Whitewater Lot 13 that is discussed in section II.C, above.  In December 1980, Mrs. Clinton borrowed $30,000 from the Bank of Kingston to pay for the model home.156   In December 1981 Lot 13 and the model home were sold in an installment sale.  The monthly payments by the buyer, while not sufficient to cover principal and interest payments on the Bank of Kingston loan, were used to service that loan, with additional payments by WWDC used to cover the debt service shortfall.   The Clintons claimed no tax deductions for the interest payments on the Bank of Kingston loan.
    <P> In September 1983 Governor Clinton obtained a $20,800 personal loan from the Security Bank of Paragould.157  The proceeds of that loan were applied towards paying off the Bank of Kingston loan.158  The Security Bank of Paragould loan also was serviced with the monthly payments from the Lot 13 installment sale and additional payments by WWDC.  From 1984-1988, the Clintons claimed*** the following interest deductions for the Security Bank of Paragould loan:
                       <PRE>
                         1984          $2,811
                         1985          $2,322
                         1986          $1,636
                         1987          $2,561
                         1988          $1,474 </PRE>
 <P>    The deductions described above are the only tax deductions claimed by the Clintons for interest payments on Whitewater-related loans.  During the time period in which these payments were made and the deductions were claimed, taxpayers were permitted to claim tax deductions for interest payments on personal bank loans.  Thus the Clintons were legally entitled to claim tax deductions for interest payments they made, and they did not knowingly claim any tax deductions beyond their personal expenses related to the Whitewater investment (some unintentional errors, attributable to poor recordkeeping for the Whitewater investments, are discussed below).
<P>The latter point is significant.  Unlike many real estate investors during this time period, the Clintons did not claim personal tax deductions for corporate losses incurred by WWDC.*  The Clintons' tax treatment of the Whitewater investment was conservative* and reflected the economic substance of the transaction -- they only claimed tax deductions when they made legally deductible payments with their own funds.  Moreover, the Clintons' tax returns for the years in which they were investors in Whitewater were prepared by certified public accountants who had worked for the Internal Revenue Service before entering private practice.159  Norton, who was the Clintons' tax preparer for the first six years of the Whitewater investment, testified160 that the Clintons did not enter into the Whitewater investment as a tax shelter.**  The Special Committee found no evidence that the Clintons ever sought to obtain any improper tax benefits from their investment in Whitewater.***  
<P> 3.  The Clintons Have Corrected Past Errors in Their Personal Tax Returns that Resulted from Inadequate Information
<P>As discussed above, the Special Committee's investigation of the Whitewater investment has confirmed what other investigations of Whitewater have found:  Records for the Whitewater investment were not properly maintained by the McDougals during the years they managed the investment, and the Clintons did not receive regular and complete information about the investment from the McDougals.  This poor recordkeeping and reporting resulted in some  unintentional errors on the Clintons' personal tax filings.  The Clintons have acknowledged and corrected those errors, even where they had no legal obligation to do so.  The problems that led to those errors and the corrections the Clintons have made are discussed below
<P>There is no question that from 1978 through 1986 the McDougals managed the Whitewater investment and the Clintons had no involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the enterprise.*  It also is clear that the McDougals did not keep careful records for the Whitewater development.  Charles James, the accountant who kept the books for Whitewater and the McDougals' other real estate projects through 1986, testified that at the end of a tax year James McDougal would sometimes bring him a box of loose records, including checks, receipts, and other documents, and ask him to prepare the WWDC tax returns.161  There is no evidence that the Clintons ever received any regular reports or briefings on Whitewater, and the available evidence suggests that the Clintons knew very little about the investment before 1986.**  James also testified that he does not believe he provided copies of the WWDC corporate tax returns to the Clintons during the period in which he prepared the returns.162   Consistent with James's recollection, there is no evidence that the Clintons signed the WWDC corporate tax returns in this time period.
<P>It is not surprising, in light of the poor quality of the Whitewater records and the lack of information provided to the Clintons, that some unintentional errors were made in the preparation of the Clintons' personal income tax returns.  Where the existence of errors has been established, the Clintons have corrected the errors and made payments for all past due amounts and interest.
<P>In December 1993 the Clintons corrected errors in their 1984 and 1985 personal tax returns relating to deductions of interest payments on Whitewater loans.  Based upon information first obtained in connection with the preparation of the Lyons Report, it appeared that an interest deduction of $2,811 claimed by the Clintons on their 1984 personal tax return,163 that resulted in tax savings of $1,181, had also been claimed on the 1984 WWDC corporate tax return.164  Even though they were under no legal obligation to do so, in December 1993 the Clintons paid over $2,700 in back taxes and interest to correct this error.
<P>A similar error on the Clintons' 1985 personal tax return also was corrected in December 1993.  An interest deduction of $2,322 claimed by the Clintons on their 1985 personal tax return,165 that resulted in tax savings of $975, had also been claimed on the 1985 WWDC corporate tax return.166  Again, even though they were under no legal obligation to do so, the Clintons paid over $2,000 in additional taxes and interest to correct this error.  
<P>Both of these errors resulted from inadequate communication of Whitewater financial information.  The Clintons and their tax preparer were unaware in 1984 and 1985 that the same deductions had been claimed on the WWDC corporate returns.167   James, who prepared the WWDC tax returns for those years, testified that he recalls providing WWDC tax information to McDougal, but he does not recall ever discussing Whitewater financial matters with the Clintons while he was the Whitewater accountant.168  Better communication and coordination between the tax preparers for the Clintons and the corporation would have prevented these errors.  The important point is that there is no reason to believe that the Clintons knew at the time that incorrect deductions had been included in their returns.
<P>In May 1996, in response to questions about Whitewater tax issues in an August 1995 report prepared for the Republican staff of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Clintons made additional corrections of unintentional errors* relating to Whitewater in their personal tax returns.  The three tax experts who conducted the May 1996 Review concluded that the evidence indicates that the vast bulk of the Clintons' Whitewater-related deductions were appropriate.  The experts found that:  (1) there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a $9,000 interest deduction on the Clintons' 1980 federal income tax return was improper; (2) the Clintons appear to have properly deducted $2,400 of interest on their 1979 tax return; (3) a $5,691 WWDC payment for a loan did not result, based on available evidence, in additional income to the Clintons in 1982; and (4) a $1,474 interest deduction on the Clintons' 1988 federal income tax return was proper.  The experts also found minor erroneous deductions taken in 1984 and 1987 ($144 for real estate taxes in 1984 and $1,665 for 1987 interest), which resulted in additional federal income tax liability of $701.  They also found an additional 1988 capital gain of $1,673 on the Lot 13 transaction that should have been reported.  This capital gain resulted in additional federal income tax liability of $563.  Finally, timing differences for interest deductions related to 1978 and 1979 result in an additional net federal tax liability of $19.  The Clintons paid $2,910 in additional taxes and interest to correct these errors.
<P>All of the corrections described above were to address unintentional errors in the Clintons' personal tax returns that resulted from inadequate information about the investment.  The Special Committee found no evidence that either the Clintons or their personal tax preparers, both of whom were former Internal Revenue Service agents, knew or should have known of these errors at the time the returns were filed.  In all cases where the existence of an error has been established, the Clintons have, at their own initiative, paid additional taxes and interest, even though they had no legal duty to do so.
<P> 4.  The Clintons Had No Reason to Report Any Personal Income from the Whitewater Investment
<P>The Special Committee also reviewed whether or not the Clintons received actual or imputed income from the Whitewater investment that they had a legal obligation to report on their personal income tax returns.  As has been the case with all other investigations of Whitewater, the Special Committee found that the Clintons received no return on their Whitewater investment.  Simply put, Whitewater never made money.
<P>At the Committee's public hearing on May 15, 1996, James and Norton confirmed that the Clintons never received any dividends or other income distributions from WWDC.169  The WWDC tax returns report accumulated tax losses of $115,000 for the years 1980-1992.  As is further discussed below, the Clintons never sought to claim any personal tax deductions for these losses.  (The Clintons paid a total of about $510,000 in personal federal income taxes in this period.)  In November 1986 James McDougal sent the Clintons a letter stating that up to that time Whitewater had lost approximately $90,000.170  This letter is significant for a number of reasons,* but for present purposes the most important point concerning the letter is that it evidences the fact that the Clintons were told by the individual who was managing the development that the venture had lost a large amount of money.  Accordingly, the Clintons had no reason to believe that they should have recognized any income from the Whitewater investment.
<P>Some esoteric tax theories have been advanced for the proposition that the Clintons should have recognized income on their personal tax returns in connection with the transfer of the Whitewater property to WWDC and the subsequent payments on the land acquisition loans that were made with WWDC corporate funds or funds contributed by the McDougals.171  These theories are not supported by the evidence obtained by the Special Committee.  The two tax professionals who were responsible for the tax returns of WWDC and the Clintons during the early years of the investment rejected these theories.  James testified that the formation of the corporation did not have any tax consequences, except that the corporation would be required to pay taxes if it was profitable (as noted above, it never was profitable).172  Norton testified that he had no reason to report any personal income associated with the WWDC for the Clintons during the period in which he prepared their tax returns.173  
<P>James and Norton are not alone in rejecting the suggestion that, while Whitewater never was profitable, the Clintons nonetheless should have recognized income of some kind from their Whitewater investment.  Leslie A. Patten, the certified public accountant who reviewed the entire accounting history of the Whitewater investment for the Clintons, in March 1992, testified that he considered that issue when he conducted his review and concluded that the Clintons need not have recognized income from Whitewater.174  At his deposition, Mr. Patten was asked if the McDougals or the Clintons had any income that should have been recognized for tax purposes after the land was conveyed to WWDC.  He answered, "No, and there should not have been."175<P>  Consistent with the position of all the witnesses examined by the Special Committee, the three tax experts who conducted the May 1996 review of Whitewater tax issues for David Kendall, the Clintons' personal counsel, also concluded that the Clintons did not incur any income from the Whitewater investment.  The experts considered whether the Clintons had "possible additional unreported income" from Whitewater because the Clintons contributed less than the McDougals (and McDougal-related entities) toward Whitewater expenses.176  The tax experts rejected this theory:  "Although [WWDC] may have had a negative net worth [arising out of the payments by the McDougals and entities they controlled]. . . this had no significance for Mr. and Mrs. Clinton as shareholders, because they were not entitled to deduct any portion of this loss and they did not realize any taxable gain on the disposition of their stock for federal income tax purposes (beyond the $1,000 [they received for the stock], which they reported in its entirety)."177  In less technical terms, the contributions by the McDougals (or companies controlled by the McDougals) to make payments of Whitewater expenses did not result in any taxable income to the Clintons as shareholders in WWDC.*
<P>It is not surprising that the tax experts and the witnesses examined by the Special Committee come to the same conclusion on this issue.  The theory that the Clintons should have recognized income from a money-losing investment flies in the face of logic and common sense.  The Clintons put money into Whitewater, but never took any money out of the investment.**  The proceeds of the Whitewater land acquisition loans were invested in the business, through the land purchase, and the Clintons did not use any portion of the proceeds of those loans for their personal benefit.  Both logic and legal analysis support the conclusion that payments of principal and interest on those loans, whether using corporate funds or funds contributed by other shareholders (the McDougals), did not result in any taxable income to the Clintons.   
<P> 5.  The Clintons Have Not Sought to Take Advantage of Whitewater Losses That They Might Have Claimed on Their Personal Tax Returns

<P>As discussed in section II.D. above, in December 1992 the Clintons sold their stock in Whitewater to James McDougal for $1,000.  The Clintons had invested about $40,500* in Whitewater and had never received any return on their investment.  As a technical matter, the Clintons were entitled to recognize a capital loss on the sale of their stock, but because of the poor quality of the Whitewater records and the resulting difficulty of establishing their tax basis in the investment,** they reported the entire $1,000 as a capital gain.178   The Clintons were entitled to recognize the capital loss they incurred when they sold their interest in the investment, but they chose not to do so, instead taking the most conservative possible approach and treating the entire $1,000 as a capital gain.  Moreover, as discussed above, the Clintons never sought to use any of WWDC's losses to offset their personal income (at a time when the tax laws would have permitted them to do so and many real estate investments were structured for that purpose).  These actions demonstrate the conservative approach taken by the Clintons throughout the entire period of the Whitewater investment.   
<P>  Finally, and perhaps most significant, as noted above, by the time the Clintons sold their interest in the corporation, WWDC had accumulated tax losses of $115,000.  During the period that the Clintons were investors in Whitewater they paid about $510,000 in personal federal income taxes.  The Clintons did not seek to claim personal tax deductions for any of the WWDC tax losses during this period, even though, as the tax experts who prepared the May 1996 Report noted, with better tax advice they could have claimed some of these losses.  This fact alone demonstrates that the Clintons were conservative in their tax treatment of the Whitewater investment and were not trying to minimize or avoid taxes with the investment.
<P>In short, the Special Committee found no evidence that the Clintons entered into the Whitewater investment as a tax shelter or ever sought to use the investment as a means to avoid paying their personal income taxes.

<H3> E.  Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan</H3>
<P> 1.  Reports on Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Make No Finding of Improper or Illegal Activity by President or Mrs. Clinton
<P>
<P>Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan  has been the subject of extensive investigations over the past decade. These investigations include examinations by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) in 1986; reviews by an independent third party real estate consultant in 1987 and 1988 pursuant to a Cease and Desist order by the FHLBB; indictments issued by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas in 1989; a Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) civil investigation in 1990; an RTC criminal investigation in 1991; and a report by the law firm Pillsbury Madison & Sutro retained by the RTC to investigate potential civil claims against Madison by the RTC.  None of these reports made any finding of illegal or improper activity by the President or Mrs. Clinton relating to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.   
<P>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board conducted an extensive examination of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association in March 1986.179  The examination found conflicts of interest among members of the board of directors of Madison, failure of management to operate Madison in a safe and sound manner, investments in questionable land development projects, excessive growth in liabilities, questionable accounting practices, incomplete and inaccurate records, inadequate internal controls, and excessive compensation to executives.180 While the examination cites by name members of the board and management of Madison for engaging in improper practices, then Governor and Mrs. Clinton are not mentioned in the report.  Pursuant to the findings of the FHLBB examination, the board of directors of Madison consented to a Cease and Desist order which became effective on August 15, 1986 and addressed most of the problems cited in the examination.181  The Cease and Desist order specifically required the board of directors to engage an independent third party real estate consultant, subject to the prior approval of the FHLBB's Supervisory Agent, to review and evaluate the association's real estate and loan and investment portfolio.182  The scope and content of the review and evaluation was also subject to the approval of the Supervisory Agent.183 
<P>The law firm of Borod and Huggins was engaged to conduct the review and evaluation. Jeffrey Gerrish, an attorney with the firm, served as lead counsel in conducting the review. The preliminary investigative report issued on March 3, 1987 found that for the period 1982 through 1986 covered by the report, numerous regulatory violations and breaches of fiduciary duty on the part of directors and officers of Madison Guaranty occurred, and that criminal violations may have occurred as well.184  However, the report makes no mention of then Governor or Mrs. Clinton.  
<P>The board of Madison Guaranty commissioned a continuation of the initial investigation into the factual basis for certain of the losses incurred by Madison Guaranty.  The board requested that its scope be expanded in anticipation of litigation against several of the insiders, friends, and associates of insiders at Madison.185  The lead counsel on this investigation was again Jeffrey Gerrish, now with the law firm of Gerrish and McCreary. 
<P>The report, submitted on August 31, 1988, set forth six potential causes of action involving, in one or all of the claims, fourteen specified individuals. The claims include potential claims for directors liability, RICO, and fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation.186 Then Governor and Mrs. Clinton are not mentioned in the report. 
<P>In November 1989, Charles Banks, U. S Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, brought indictments against James McDougal, the major stockholder in Madison Guaranty, David Henley, an employee of Madison Financial Corporation, and Jim Henley, a salesman on commission for various Madison Financial developments, for alleged violations of law in regard to Madison Guaranty.187  An indictment was also brought against John Latham, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Madison Guaranty, in February 1990.188  None of the indictments mention then Governor and Mrs. Clinton. 
<P>When the RTC placed Madison Guaranty into conservatorship in 1989, it inherited an accounting malpractice case which Madison had brought against the accounting firm of Frost and Company.189  Frost had audited Madison's financial statement in 1984 and 1985. When the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's 1986 examination of Madison found significant accounting deficiencies, Madison sued Frost for malpractice.190  In February 1991, April Breslaw, a Senior Attorney for the RTC, wrote a memo proposing to settle the pending accounting malpractice case. The memo reviewed the facts of the case and argued that the settlement offered was as much as the RTC was likely to recover by going to court.191  The memo made no mention of the Clintons. 
<P>In addition, the RTC undertook a civil investigation of Madison Guaranty to determine if there was ground to bring a civil action against the directors and officers of Madison Guaranty.  April Breslaw drafted a memo recommending that the RTC terminate the directors' and officers' liability investigation for Madison Guaranty. The memo listed nine individuals who might be held culpable for the failure of the association, but concluded that the potential recovery was insufficient to make a liability claim economically justifiable and recommended a close-out of the investigation.192  The memo also contained no references to the Clintons.
<P>In September, 1992,  L. Richard Iorio, a Field Investigations Officer for the RTC, sent to Charles Banks, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty . The referral was prepared by Jean Lewis, Criminal Investigator for the RTC. It listed three individuals as suspected of criminal violations - James McDougal, Susan McDougal, and Lisa Anspaugh. Among the suspected violations were check kiting, bank fraud, and forgery.193
<P>The referral also listed 12 companies each of which maintained a checking account at Madison Guaranty. One of those companies was Whitewater Development Corporation. It also listed seven individuals, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, who were principals in one or more of those companies. The report also listed the Clintons as witnesses who might have information about the suspected violation.194  No allegation of wrongdoing was made toward the Clintons.
<P>Finally, the RTC retained the law firm of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro in January 1994 to investigate potential civil claims on behalf of the RTC relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater Development Corporation. In April 1995, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro released a preliminary report on Whitewater that described the history of the venture and its relationship to Madison Guaranty. In regard to the involvement of the Clintons as investors in Whitewater, the report stated:
<P>The available evidence shows only that the Clintons knew of the existence of at least some of the bank debt incurred by Whitewater and its shareholders, signed some promissory notes and loan extension, and on occasions made payments on bank debt or taxes out of their personal checking account.  The evidence also suggests that the Clintons had little direct involvement in Whitewater's's financial management until 1988, by which all of the lots had been sold and McDougal had suffered a nervous breakdown.195

<P>The report also found that "So far as can be determined from the available documentary evidence, little Whitewater financial information was transmitted to the Clintons."196  The report recommended that no further resources be expended on the Whitewater part of this investigation.197 
<P>In December 1995, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro released a supplemental report on Whitewater. In regard to the role of the Clintons as investors in Whitewater, the report stated:
<P>Putting aside for the moment the legal significance of the phrase "passive investor," the evidence is essentially consistent with this assertion. For the relevant period (ending in 1986), the evidence suggests that the McDougals and not the Clintons had managerial control over the enterprise, or received annual reports or regular financial summaries. Instead, as the Clintons suggest, their main contact with Whitewater seems to have consisted of signing loan extensions and renewals.198 
<P>
The report further stated that:

<P>There is no basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything of substance about McDougal's advances to Whitewater, the source of the funds used to make those advances or the source of the funds used to make payments on bank debt.199
<P>
The report concluded that: 

<P>There is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind of primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. This investigation had revealed no evidence to support any such claims. Nor would the record support any claim of secondary or derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others."200

<P>In addition to the report by Pillsbury, the House Banking Committee held four days of hearings on August 7, 8, 9, and 10, 1995. The Committee undertook a review of the matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater and released numerous documents to the public.
<P>The Office of Independent Counsel has also been investigating Whitewater and its relationship to Madison Guaranty. It has entered into a number of plea agreements with individuals who were targets of its investigation.  A well-publicized trial was recently completed in Arkansas which dealt with matters relating to Madison Guaranty. One of the prosecutors in the trial for the Office of Independent Counsel, W. Ray Jahn, in his closing statement at the trial, said that: "The man occupying the position of the Office of the Presidency is not on trial here. There's been no allegations of wrongdoing on the part of David Hale directed toward even the President."201<P>
<P> 2.  Madison Guaranty in the Context of the Nationwide S&L Crisis

<P>Given all of the attention that has been directed toward the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, it is worthwhile to consider the failure of Madison in the larger context of the national crisis that confronted the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.
<P>According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), over 1300 federally insured savings and loans failed in the United States between 1980 and 1995 with total assets of over $600 billion.202  In the state of Arkansas during that same period, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), the federal agency responsible for supervising federally insured savings and loans, 22 savings and loans failed with total assets of over $6.8 billion.203  Madison Guaranty, with assets of $114 million, was the eleventh largest failed Arkansas savings and loans.204
<P>The most intensive analysis of the failure of Madison Guaranty, entitled "The Condition and Regulation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association in the 1980's and Its Seizure in 1989", was  prepared for the House Banking Committee by James Barth and Dan Brumbaugh, Jr.205  That report points out that Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association was a stockholder owned, state-chartered Arkansas savings and loan whose deposits were insured by the Federal Savings and Loan insurance Corporation ("FSLIC"), whose successor agency is the FDIC.206
<P>The report points out that Madison was only one of 12 federally insured savings and loans in  Arkansas that was seized in 1989.207  Further, although Madison had been reporting insolvency since the end of 1987, ten of the eleven other institutions seized in 1989 had been reporting insolvency longer.208  The report also points out that:
<P>According to the most recent estimates of the RTC, Madison cost an estimated $73 million to resolve. Four other Arkansas Savings and loans that were insolvent in 1989 were resolved at greater -- and in some instances substantially greater -- cost, and they are all federally chartered institutions.  First Federal of Arkansas cost $833 million, Savers Savings Association $645 million, Independence $314 million, and Landmark Savings $91 million. Overall... Madison cost only 3.3% of the total estimated resolution cost of institutions, which like itself, were open but insolvent in Arkansas in part of 1989 before being seized.209

<P> In order to place the failure of Madison Guaranty further into perspective, it is worth noting that Madison was located in the Ninth District of the Federal Home Loan bank System, which encompasses the five states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas.210  According to the report,  by 1986 50% of the savings and loans (a total of 246 institutions) in that district were reporting losses, and 65 percent (a total of 311 institutions) did so in 1987.211  As the report states:
<P>At year-end 1987, there were 186 institutions in the Ninth district reporting insolvency based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The institutions had $60 billion in assets and were reporting negative tangible of $16 billion and negative income of $7.3 billion. At this time, Madison's $111 million in assets represented two one hundredths of one percent of the total assets of insolvent institutions in the ninth district, and its $12 million negative capital represented eight one thousandths of one percent of the total negative capital reported in the district.212

<P>The report pointed out that 36 percent of the nation's insolvent institutions with 33 percent of the assets were in the ninth district.213  The report also stated:
<P>A conclusion that Madison was somehow unique in its collapse and the costs that it imposed on federal taxpayers because it received special treatment or leniency from state regulators does not appear to be supported by the information we have reviewed.214

<H3>  F.  The Treatment of the McDougals and their Business Enterprises by Arkansas State Agencies</H3>

     The McDougals operated several business enterprises in Arkansas during the 1980s, including Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, Madison Bank & Trust, and various real estate developments.*  The activities of these business enterprises brought the McDougals into frequent contact with state regulatory agencies.  
<P>The allegation has been raised that the McDougals and their business enterprises obtained favored treatment from state regulators due to the McDougals' relationship with Governor Clinton.  In particular, it has been alleged that Governor Clinton influenced state actions to benefit the McDougals.  It also has been suggested that the McDougals provided financial benefits to the Clintons in return for the allegedly favorable treatment. 
<P>The record, however, is at odds with the allegations.  The evidence demonstrated that the McDougals did not receive favored treatment from state agencies; state officials treated the McDougals and their business enterprises properly and appropriately, in the normal course of business.  The evidence further demonstrated that Governor Clinton did not intervene with state officials in the McDougals' behalf, or assist the McDougals in their dealings with state agencies.  Finally, the record does not support the allegation that the McDougals provided improper financial benefits to the Clintons.

<H3>G. The Treatment of the McDougals's and their business enterprises by Arkansas state agencies</H3>

<P> 1.  Treatment of the Whitewater Investment

<P>James McDougal was not involved in any state-related business until he purchased a majority interest in the Bank of Kingston in 1980.215  Prior to that time, McDougal had worked as a Senate aide and a real estate developer.216
<P> 2.  There is No Evidence that Arkansas State Agency Leases of Offices from Madison Guaranty Were Improper
<P>Between April 1984 and November 1985, the State of Arkansas entered into three leases for office space in Little Rock buildings owned by Madison Financial Corporation ("MFC"), a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty.  On April 10, 1984 the Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") leased office space in the Madison Guaranty Building at 1501 Main Street.  On August 13, 1985, AHDA's successor agency -- the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA") -- leased additional space in the same building.  Finally, on November 7, 1985, the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration leased a small building at 1520 Main Street from MFC.  
<P>The Special Committee has investigated whether any of the leases were signed because of Governor Clinton's relationship with James McDougal, Madison Guaranty's owner.  In particular, the Committee has sought to determine whether the leases were related to a fundraiser that McDougal held for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty on April 5, 1985.  The evidence collected by the Committee establishes that the leases were entirely proper and appropriate, and were entered into in the normal course of business.  There is no evidence that Governor Clinton or anyone acting on his behalf caused or directed the leases to be signed, or that Madison Guaranty received any special consideration.  Moreover, the State first leased space at Madison Guaranty at least a year before the fundraiser took place.  Thus, there is no basis to connect the fundraiser with the leases, and no reason to believe that the leases entailed a quid pro quo of any kind.
<P><P>a.  The AHDA Lease at Madison Guaranty
<P>The Arkansas Housing Development Agency was created in 1977 to issue bonds and use the proceeds to make housing loans to lower and middle income families.  At the time, AHDA was authorized to issue $15 million in bonds.  In 1979, as part of a broad economic development effort, AHDA's bond issuance authority was increased to $600 million -- which caused the agency to grow dramatically.  
<P>In 1979, AHDA moved into the Donaghey Building at 7th and Main Streets in Little Rock.  By 1983, however, the Donaghey Building space had become inadequate.  AHDA was forced to occupy noncontiguous offices that were separated by 75 yards.217  Also, the space was too small to house the agency, which had grown as its bond issuance authority increased.218  Although AHDA tried to obtain additional space within the Donaghey Building, this proved impossible.219  Accordingly, in June 1983, AHDA's Board authorized Executive Director Linda Trent to take steps to relocate the agency.
<P>AHDA's efforts to move continued when Wooten Epes became Executive Director in September 1983.  Epes placed Deputy Director C.E. Anderson in charge of the search process.  Anderson contacted Arkansas State Building Services ("SBS").220  This was standard procedure; SBS oversees leasing for all Arkansas state agencies, schools and universities.221  
<P>Upon receiving AHDA's request, SBS publicly announced AHDA's space requirements, advertised for bid proposals, and began accepting solicitations.222  SBS received a number of proposals.  Even so, Epes recalled that "there just weren't that many options" that satisfied AHDA's most basic requirements.223  He noted:
<P>I couldn't find what I wanted, and that was within our price range anyway.  We needed a pretty good chunk of space in one block and that was generally the problem, finding that and finding it in a low cost building.224
<P>
In addition, AHDA preferred a downtown Little Rock location, near other State agencies and support services.225  
<P>SBS considered nearly 20 possible locations for AHDA, but it proved difficult to find suitable space.  Old World Plaza, for example, was in North Little Rock and was not handicapped accessible.  The Executive Building, Evergreen Place, and Plaza West were located five miles outside downtown Little Rock.  The Continental Building was unrenovated.  The Spring Building, the Pyramid Building, Commercial National Bank Building, and the Heritage Center could not provide sufficient space on a single floor.  The Tower Building was too expensive.  In addition, many of the buildings could not provide sufficient parking for AHDA employees.226
<P>Although none of the available choices was ideal, AHDA needed to move as soon as possible because its current location was inadequate.  Accordingly, on October 31, 1983, AHDA asked SBS for authority to negotiate a lease at 1300 Brookwood Drive (which was located three or four miles from downtown).  At the time, AHDA anticipated leasing 5800 square feet of office space at a rate of $6.50 per square foot -- a total cost of $37,700 per year.  However, efforts to negotiate a satisfactory lease with the Brookwood building's owner proved unsuccessful.  The "final proposal" from the Brookwood building's owner was $8.60 per square foot -- a total cost of $49,880 per year.  In light of the higher than expected cost, AHDA and SBS "concurred in the rejection" of the Brookwood proposal.*  The Governor's office played no part in the rejection of the Brookwood proposal.
<P>Meanwhile, in January or February 1984, Madison Guaranty submitted a proposal to SBS.  Shortly thereafter, Susan McDougal visited SBS to propose the Madison Guaranty Building as a potential site for AHDA.  McDougal met with Mallard and Leasing Supervisor Helen Herr in his office.**  This was not unusual; as Mallard observed: "You have meetings with everybody that you lease buildings from or lease buildings to."227  Herr confirmed that building owners regularly visited SBS to promote their properties, and agreed that the meeting with Susan McDougal was "just a regular part of [SBS's] business."228  
<P>Following the meeting, Mallard asked Herr to look into the Madison Guaranty Building as a site for AHDA.  Once again, this was common practice.  Herr stated:
<P>People contacted [Mallard] a lot about different buildings that they had available, and he would bring it to [the leasing officials'] attention.229  
<P>
Herr testified that Mallard did not ask her to treat the Madison Guaranty proposal any differently from any other proposal and that she did not do so.230   
<P>As Mallard requested, Herr visited the Madison Guaranty Building with AHDA Deputy Director Anderson.231  Anderson raised two principal concerns about the Madison Guaranty Building as a site for the agency.232  First, the building was located in the Quapaw Quarter, an older section of downtown Little Rock adjacent to the Governor's mansion.  Although the Quapaw Quarter was undergoing redevelopment, some AHDA employees worried that the neighborhood was unsafe.233  Second, AHDA had grown and expected to grow further.  AHDA thus wanted to ensure that the Madison Guaranty space was large enough to accommodate the expected growth.234  
<P>Anderson's first concern -- the location of the Madison Guaranty Building -- actually provided an inducement to lease there because State policy called for using State agencies to revitalize downtown Little Rock.  This was especially significant for AHDA, the agency with primary responsibility for economic development.235  As such, the decision to move AHDA to the Madison Guaranty Building was consistent with both State policy and the mission of the agency.  
<P>Bob Nash, Governor Clinton's senior economic development adviser, testified that the State actively promoted development in "deteriorating" parts of the State such as the Quapaw  Quarter.236  Betsey Wright, Governor Clinton's chief of staff, confirmed that the State had a policy "that all things being equal and where economically feasible, that we would help keep downtown Little Rock alive."237
<P>Similarly, SBS Director Mallard testified that SBS had a longstanding policy to promote development downtown, which predated his service at SBS.238  In fact, SBS' governing board had made this policy explicit.  He stated:
<P>It was an official policy of and it was a set policy when I [came] on board as director, that we try to lease any of the space in the downtown buildings that we could.  And that had been concurred with by a state building service council, which council . . . I served under.239  

<P>As a practical matter, this policy predisposed Mallard and SBS to lease space in the Quapaw Quarter whenever possible.  In this regard, Mallard testified that: 
<P>It had been a bad area at one time, just like all of Downtown Little Rock was fast becoming, and we [were] encouraged by our council and all of the downtown real estate community to lease all those buildings we could lease.  And we tried, every time we made a lease, we tried to - we tried to lease from downtown areas.240

<P>SBS Leasing Supervisor Herr also testified that the State's revitalization policy played a role in the site selection for AHDA.  Herr testified:
<P>Quapaw Quarter was a historic area and there was a separate agency charged with maintaining the integrity of the area, so I was well aware of the push and the need to develop that area.241
<P>
Moreover, Herr agreed that the policy was "a good thing."242
<P>Even AHDA Director Epes acknowledged that Governor Clinton rightfully was concerned about improving the Quapaw Quarter, which encompassed a 10 block radius around the governor's mansion.  He stated:
<P>[Governor Clinton] felt like the state needed to try to have a presence in this part of town because there was an ongoing effort to revitalize and redevelop that part of Main Street in Little Rock. It was only a few blocks from the Governor's mansion, and it was kind of a part of town that needed redeveloping, and he felt that this might help that process.243

<P>In addition, witnesses uniformly testified that safety concerns regarding the Quapaw Quarter were exaggerated.  For example, Mallard testified that the neighborhood was improving.244  Helen Herr, the SBS leasing manager, stated that the employees were "overreacting."245  AHDA Director Epes testified that he felt obligated to present his employees' security concerns to SBS and the Governor's office, but did not share those concerns.  He stated: "[M]y own concerns were not that strong because I didn't live very far from there."246  Bob Nash -- the member of the Governor's staff to whom Epes raised the concerns -- worked in the Quapaw Quarter for seven years before joining the Governor's staff.247  He considered the concerns "sincere but unfounded."248  Nash explained:
<P>I figured that it was just a lack of understanding or a perception that because an area was low-income that it automatically was not as safe as other areas, and I just don't believe that.  . . .  I did not think that it was a security problem in that area, because again, the governor's mansion is in that area and a lot of other people have moved into that general area and restored old homes.  It was coming back.249  
<P>
Betsey Wright shared Nash's assessment, adding that such concerns commonly were "racist in [their bearing," and that the State had an obligation not to accommodate them.250
<P>In any event, any reasonable security concerns were alleviated when Madison Guaranty agreed to fence in the parking lot and to hire a security guard.251  Notably, during AHDA's three and one half year tenancy in the Madison Guaranty Building, not a single serious crime was reported.252
<P>Anderson's second concern -- the physical layout of the Madison Guaranty space -- also proved to be a positive factor.  Glen Cox, an SBS architect, toured the space and drafted floor plans that demonstrated that the Madison Guaranty building had sufficient space for AHDA's needs.253  This assessment was confirmed sixteen months later when Madison Guaranty made additional space in the building available to AHDA.  As such, the Madison Guaranty space was not only large enough to accommodate AHDA's current needs, but offered space for expansion.
<P>Moreover, much of the office space offered to AHDA was old and in poor condition.  The Madison Guaranty Building, by contrast, was undergoing a complete renovation at the time.  The renovation assured ADHA of high quality space that it could design to its own specifications.  In the end, therefore, AHDA received newly renovated, custom-designed office space.
<P>After satisfying himself that AHDA's concerns had been addressed, SBS Director Mallard decided to move AHDA to the Madison Guaranty Building.  Mallard testified that he made the decision solely on the merits, without any pressure from the Governor's office.254  The record supports Mallard's testimony that he made the leasing decision unilaterally.  For example, Epes recalled that SBS made the decision to move the agency to Madison, and testified that he was not aware of any pressure from the Governor's office.255  AHDA Board Chairman Mort Hardwicke stated similarly that no one from the Governor's office tried to influence him or any other AHDA official.256  Finally, Bob Nash, Governor Clinton's liaison with AHDA, testified that, to his knowledge, no one in the Governor's office was involved in the decision.257  
<P>In a March 5, 1984 letter, Epes advised Herr that AHDA "rejected" Mallard's decision to move the agency to the Madison Guaranty Building.*  The letter raised three concerns:  (1) the Madison proposal was $7,000 more expensive than the Brookwood proposal, in part because Madison included a flat charge for utilities, which AHDA could not control; (2) AHDA preferred to stay "in a downtown location, preferably within walking distance of our attorneys;" and (3) the Madison space did not provide for anticipated personnel growth.  The letter made no mention of employee security or the neighborhood.258  
<P>Although it is not clear exactly how SBS evaluated AHDA's expressed concerns, it is clear that the concerns were meritless.  First, with respect to price, the Madison Guaranty space actually cost less than the Brookwood space on a per square foot basis -- the higher total price arose because Madison Guaranty offered AHDA 6852 square feet of space, whereas Brookwood offered only 5,780 square feet.  In addition, SBS negotiated a provision in the Madison Guaranty lease which permitted an annual adjustment in the cost of utilities based on actual usage, thus giving AHDA control of a significant cost component.  Second, Madison Guaranty was downtown (albeit not in the central business district where the cost of a lease would have been prohibitive in any event).  AHDA's concerns regarding Madison Guaranty's location are puzzling in light of the agency's efforts to move to Brookwood Drive.  According to Epes, the Brookwood Drive building was in West Little Rock, three or four miles from downtown, which would not have been a convenient location for AHDA.  Third, the Madison Guaranty space plainly permitted further growth, because AHDA leased 1,500 additional square feet from Madison in August 1985.  In any event, it is clear that SBS was not convinced by AHDA's arguments.  Shortly thereafter, SBS advised AHDA that it would have to move into the Madison Guaranty Building despite the objections stated in the March 5, 1984 letter.  
<P>Following SBS' decision, AHDA made a final effort to avoid moving to Madison Guaranty.  At Epes' request, Mallard met with Bob Nash, Governor Clinton's liaison with AHDA.259  Although Epes initiated the meeting, he did not attend;  Deputy Director Anderson and two Board members represented AHDA.*  Mallard did not recall precisely when the meeting occurred, but believed it to have been "fairly close" to the time the lease was signed in early April 1984.260
<P>According to Mallard -- the only witness who testified about the meeting -- the meeting was brief.  AHDA restated its concerns about the neighborhood around the Madison Guaranty Building.  Mallard responded that:
<P>[W]e felt that this building was more suitable to their needs and we were trying to keep all the agencies in the downtown area.  And we were just trying to help downtown Little Rock stay viable and stay alive.  At that time there was so many vacant buildings.261
<P>
Mallard then "declined again" to reverse his decision "and that was the end of the meeting."262  Nash did not express any opinion about the Madison Guaranty lease, either on behalf of himself or the Governor's office.263 
<P>Sometime later, AHDA Board Chairman Hardwicke approached Epes and offered to set up a meeting with Governor Clinton to press their case.  Epes agreed, and a meeting ensued.264  Epes recalls that he was accompanied by Hardwicke and that a gubernatorial staffer also may have attended the meeting.  (Hardwicke did not remember the meeting; he could not even confirm that it took place.)265  
<P>Only Epes remembered anything that was said at the meeting, and his recollection was limited and general.  In sum, Epes testified that he apprised Governor Clinton of his staff's safety concerns,* but that Governor Clinton believed the concerns could be addressed.266  Epes added that Governor Clinton said the State needed to have a presence in the downtown area, and that he was interested in revitalizing the area.267  (As noted above, Betsey Wright and Bob Nash both testified that revitalization of downtown Little Rock was a priority for Governor Clinton and that state agencies were an integral part of the Governor's revitalization efforts.)268  Ultimately, Clinton declined to overrule the decision of the Director of Building Services.269  Significantly, the McDougals were not discussed.270
<P>On April 10, 1984, AHDA and Madison Guaranty executed a lease for 6,852 square feet of space at a price of $8.50 per square foot -- a total of $58,242.  The leased commenced in July 1984, when, as scheduled, AHDA moved into custom-renovated offices in the Madison Guaranty Building.*  
<P>SBS Leasing Administrator Helen Herr described the price as "competitive" and testified that "the quality of space as presented was good, and did justify the cost per square foot."271  She added that the floor plan was entirely "workable."272  Mallard stated that AHDA was satisfied with the Madison space after AHDA moved in.  "I know after [Epes] got there, he was happy, and, you know, I would see him from time to time and he expressed himself that he was happy there."273  Epes agreed. 
<P>[O]nce we determined that that's where we were moving, there was a construction period where they built out our space for us. It was an old warehouse that had been converted so it was raw space and we were able to put up the walls and the offices in an arrangement that was best for us.274

<P>Moreover, the AHDA lease apparently had the intended catalytic effect on the Quapaw Quarter.  Herr observed that the neighborhood improved after AHDA moved into the Madison Guaranty building and that "[t]here was a lot more activity in that area, business activity in that area."275

<P><P>b.  ADFA'S Expansion of the AHDA Lease

<P>During April 1985, legislation was enacted transforming the Arkansas Housing Development Agency into the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.  ADFA's responsibilities were significantly broader than AHDA's.  ADFA also had authority to hire several additional employees.  This, in turn, created a need for additional office space. 
<P>On April 9, 1985, AHDA Director Epes wrote to SBS Director Mallard.  Epes advised Mallard of the ADFA legislation, and noted that AHDA expected to hire "three to four additional employees for Development Finance efforts."  Epes added that AHDA had hired two additional employees since it moved into the Madison building.  He therefore requested SBS to seek additional space to accommodate the new employees.276
<P>Fortunately, the Madison Guaranty Building had additional space available at a competitive price.277  Thus, ADFA could increase its office space without the expense and dislocation of moving.278  In this regard, SBS Leasing Manager Herr testified that "it would not have made any fiscal sense to relocate [AHDA] at that time, if space was available at a reasonable rate right next door."279  Mallard agreed that it was "reasonable" to expand into the adjoining space.  He added that:  "We always tried to keep [agencies] in the same space if we could."280
<P>Accordingly, on August 13, 1985, ADFA leased 1,456 square feet of additional office space at Madison Guaranty.  The new space was adjacent to ADFA's existing space.  The price was slightly higher -- $9.32 per square foot as opposed to $8.50 for the existing space -- but this amount included significant renovations.  The base rent remained the same.  According to Herr, the price was reasonable considering the construction entailed in customizing the new space for the agency.281
<P><P>There is no evidence of impropriety in connection with the lease expansion.
<P><P>c.  The Revenue Office Lease at 1520 Main Street
<P>The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration ("DFA") operates approximately 140 "revenue offices" throughout the State.  Among other things, Arkansans can renew their drivers licenses and automobile registrations at revenue offices.  DFA makes a concerted effort to spread revenue offices out in such a way as to make them accessible to all Arkansans.282
<P>As of 1985, DFA occupied a revenue office on Wealth Street in downtown Little Rock.  However, the Wealth Street office was infested by rodents and insects.283  In addition, the office had been broken into and robbed several times.284  Accordingly, Revenue Department Administrator John Cox decided to move the office to a safer location in the same neighborhood.285  In particular, Cox decided to move to a former service station located at 1520 Main Street --  across the street from the Madison Guaranty Building -- that was owned by Madison Financial.  The service station was about five blocks from the Wealth Street location.
<P>Only one witness recalled anything substantive about this lease.  SBS Leasing Manager Morris Patterson -- who handled all revenue office leases -- offered the only pertinent testimony.  Patterson stated that Cox found the property on his own, then called Patterson directly and asked him to negotiate and draft a lease for the property.286  A letter from John Cox* to Patterson confirms that DFA found the space.287  Patterson had no contact with the Governor's office regarding the move or the lease, and Cox did not mention any such contact to Patterson during the leasing process.288  Mallard had a general recollection that Cox found the space and contacted Patterson directly, but could not recall any details. 
<P>According to Patterson, the building was reasonably priced -- 2,315 square feet at $7.50 per square foot -- and was well renovated to DFA's specifications.  Patterson added that the building remains in use as a revenue office today.289
<P>The record concerning the revenue office lease is clear.  This was a run-of-the-mill, unremarkable transaction.  The Governor's office had no involvement at all.  In fact, there is no evidence that anyone outside DFA and SBS played any part in the lease negotiations.
<P><P>d.  ADFA'S Move to the Technology Center
<P>On September 1, 1987, ADFA moved from the Madison Guaranty Building to the Technology Center at 100 Main Street in Little Rock.  The new lease encompassed 10,800 square feet of space at a price of $11.00 per square foot, for a total of $118,800 per year.  As of March 1, 1992, ADFA occupied 15,040 square feet.
<P>There are two noteworthy aspects to this move.  First, although the move took place before ADFA's lease at Madison expired, this did not result in any cost to the State.  The owners of the Technology Center assumed financial responsibility to Madison Financial for ADFA's breaking the lease.  Second, the Technology Center was owned by an investment group headed by Tom Ferstl, a prominent Republican opponent of Governor Clinton's.  This is totally inconsistent with the suggestion that the Governor's office was manipulating the leasing process to benefit Governor Clinton's friends or political supporters. 
<P><P>e.  Neither Governor Clinton nor his staff pressured anyone to lease office space from Madison Guaranty

<P>Not one witness was contacted by the Governor or anyone acting on his behalf.  In fact, the Governor's only involvement in the leasing process came after SBS Director Mallard already had decided to move AHDA to the Madison Guaranty Building.  Even then, Governor Clinton did not initiate the meeting.  AHDA Director Epes and Board Chairman Hardwicke sought a meeting to discuss the agency's move to Madison Guaranty.  The Governor merely acceded to their request.290  
<P>In any event, the evidence indicates that the meeting was perfunctory and insubstantial.  Epes described the meeting as "fairly brief."291  Hardwicke could not even recall whether a meeting took place.292  Most important, Governor Clinton refused to get involved in the dispute between AHDA and SBS.  He simply restated his policy of promoting development in low income areas, noted Madison Guaranty's proximity to the governor's mansion, and declined to overrule the director of SBS.293  Neither Governor Clinton nor anyone acting on his behalf took any action as a consequence of the meeting.
<P>The Committee has taken extensive sworn testimony regarding the State leases at Madison Guaranty.  That testimony is consistent and clear.  Every single witness has testified that SBS acted unilaterally in selecting the Madison Guaranty Building for AHDA's offices.  There is no evidence that Governor Clinton or his staff sought to influence the selection process.
<P>Despite the overwhelming weight of the evidence, the majority has seized on the deposition testimony of Helen Herr to suggest that SBS did not act unilaterally.294  According to Herr, Mallard advised her that: 
<P>[T]he governor's office wanted us to lease that space, that they were interested in -- as I recall, he said they were interested in helping the development in the quarter area, South Main, and that the McDougals were friends [of the Clintons].295
<P>
Mallard denied making the statement that Herr attributed to him.296  However, even assuming he made the statement and forgot, it does not suggest any impropriety and, in fact, is consistent with the other evidence.  As discussed previously, Epes and Hardwicke met with Governor Clinton in March or April 1985, but could not persuade him to overrule Mallard's decision or to intervene in the leasing process.297  Herr testified that her conversation with Mallard took place after that meeting and that Mallard was merely apprising Herr that the Governor would not interfere with the decision Mallard made before the meeting.298  
<P>Additional testimony further undermines any claim that Herr's testimony suggests improper conduct in connection with the Madison Guaranty lease.  First and foremost, SBS Director Mallard testified that he made the decision to lease space from Madison Guaranty for state agencies.299  Neither Governor Clinton nor anyone acting on his behalf exerted any influence on Mallard to lease space from Madison Guaranty or any other lessor.300  Mallard stated:
<P>The Governor never said anything to me at all about this lease or any other lease that we made while I was at state building service, 4-1/2 years or whatever length of time I was there.301
<P>
Mallard summarized that: "I had no pressure at all."302  Nor did Mallard select the Madison Guaranty space based on McDougal's relationship with Governor Clinton.  Mallard flatly denied that he was influenced by the fact that McDougal was a friend and supporter of the Governor.303  
<P>Morris Patterson -- the SBS leasing manager who drafted the AHDA lease -- confirmed Mallard's testimony.  Patterson stated plainly that "[n]obody" tried to pressure him, and that he was "not aware of any pressure whatsoever" from the Governor's office to lease space from Madison Guaranty.304  
<P>AHDA Board Chairman Mort Hardwicke gave similar testimony.  Hardwicke stated that no one from the Governor's office tried to influence him regarding the move to the Madison Guaranty Building, and that he had no reason to believe that any other AHDA official was pressured.305  
<P>Finally, Bob Nash, Governor Clinton's liaison with AHDA, testified that neither Governor Clinton nor anyone acting on his behalf sought to influence SBS to lease space from Madison Guaranty.306  On the contrary, Nash testified that SBS decided unilaterally to lease from Madison Guaranty.307  In fact, Nash first learned that SBS was considering the Madison Guaranty space after the decision to lease the space had been made.308  Nash summarized that he had "no reason to believe that [the selection of the Madison Guaranty Building] was not proper and appropriate."309
<P><P>f.  It was common for state agencies to object to the space chosen for them by SBS

<P>Much has been made of the fact that AHDA initially objected to the Madison Guaranty space.  In fact, ADHA's objections have little significance.  State agencies routinely raised concerns about the office space assigned to them by SBS.310  It would have been more surprising if the move were met with silence.  Moreover, AHDA's legitimate concerns were addressed and resolved before the agency moved into Madison Guaranty.  In the end, the Madison Guaranty space proved well-suited to AHDA's needs, and the agency was entirely satisfied.
<P>SBS officials uniformly testified that it was common for state agencies to raise objections to the space selected for them by SBS.  For example, SBS Director Mallard stated:
<P>[E]very time we moved an agency, usually someone within that agency objected. I mean, this was nothing unusual. You would have someone within the agency would have to drive a few miles further. You would have someone in the agency that would lose a parking place. You would -every time you moved someone, if you didn't let them go exactly where they wanted to go, and then there were some dissatisfied if you let them go where they wanted to go.311
<P>
Similarly, Helen Herr agreed it was common for state employees to raise complaints when their agencies were slated to move.312 
<P>Nor was it unusual that AHDA Director Epes made a direct plea to SBS regarding the Madison Guaranty space.*  Mallard stated:  "[Y]ou would always have agency directors that would - a lot of times I had them calling me saying they wasn't going to move. They couldn't, wouldn't move."313
<P>Betsey Wright confirmed that agencies commonly objected to SBS decisions, and that the Governor's office frequently was called upon to mediate those objections.  She added that efforts to move agencies to downtown locations were particularly likely to engender opposition, and not always for legitimate reasons.314  Wright stated:
<P>Sometimes agencies didn't particularly want to be in downtown Little Rock, and I would have conversations with the agency directors or department directors about what the problems were, and state building services would be working with the owners to see if they could be accommodated.

<P>Quite frankly, in many cases, the concern was racist in its bearing, and it was in part my responsibility to try to determine and ascertain where that was the barrier, because that was one we weren't going to allow to be a barrier.315

<P>In any event, in the end, AHDA's objections proved unfounded.  When asked his opinion of the agency's new offices, Epes testified:  "I liked it.  It was -- it was laid out well, and we got to design our space in a manner that was suitable for us."316  Morris Patterson, the career SBS official who drafted the lease confirmed Epes' testimony.  He recounted that "[Epes] readily worked with me on this to do the floor plan, like he was happy to go there."317  
<P><P>g.  The April 5, 1985 Madison Fundraiser
<P>On April 5, 1985, James McDougal hosted a fundraiser for Bill Clinton at the Madison Guaranty Building.  The event raised approximately $33,000.  It has been alleged that one or more of the state agency leases at Madison Guaranty was a quid pro quo for the fundraiser.  As discussed above, this claim conflicts with the unanimous testimony of the State officials who conducted the leasing process.  Moreover, the initial AHDA lease at Madison Guaranty -- which was the only lease that even came to the Governor's attention -- was signed a full year before the fundraiser.  
<P>Questions also have been raised about certain contributions that the campaign received during the fundraiser.  Although Charles Peacock III apparently made $6,000 in unlawful contributions at the fundraiser, the record demonstrates that the campaign did not know the contributions were unlawful and had no reason to suspect that the contributions were anything but proper.
<P><P>  (1)  Background
<P>Charles Peacock III was the largest minority shareholder in Madison Guaranty, and served on the board of directors when James McDougal ran the institution.  He and his companies also were substantial borrowers from Madison; Peacock's total debt to Madison ultimately exceeded $1 million.318  Included in that amount were two loans that Peacock received at the time of the fundraiser.  On April 4, 1985, Peacock received a $50,000 personal loan; on April 5, 1985 Dixie Continental Leasing, a company owned by Peacock, received a $297,000 loan.  Most of the funds Peacock and Dixie Continental borrowed in April 1985 were used to purchase a 30 acre parcel of land from Madison Financial.319  Approximately $11,000 of the loan proceeds, however, cannot be traced.
<P> At the April 5, 1985 fundraiser, Peacock made two $3,000 contributions to Governor Clinton in the names of others -- his son, Ken Peacock, and his business partner, Dene Landrum.320  Both contributions were for legally permissible amounts, and on their face, were entirely proper.321  However, Arkansas campaign finance law prohibits making a contribution in the name of another person.322  Thus, the contributions violated the Arkansas election code.  Peacock admits that he made the contributions, but denies knowing that making contributions in the name of another was illegal.323  Peacock also denies that he used the proceeds from the April 1985 loans to fund the contributions.324
<P>In any event, after McDougal was removed from control of Madison, Peacock defaulted on his loans.  As a consequence, by 1987, Madison Guaranty was engaged in collection and bankruptcy litigation against Peacock and several of his companies.  
<P>Patricia Heritage [Hays] was the collection officer who coordinated the Peacock litigation for Madison Guaranty.  On April 21, 1987, Peacock's lawyer, Greg Hopkins, appeared unexpectedly at Hays' office.  Hopkins made a series of "very angry" allegations about Madison's lawyers, the Mitchell, Williams firm, and its conduct of the Peacock litigation.325  
<P>Hays viewed the allegations as the kind of "huffing and puffing that a litigator will do to gain an advantage for his client."*  Hopkins was faring poorly in the Peacock litigation, and apparently hoped to pressure Madison to reach a settlement.326  Also, Hays knew that Hopkins was angry at Lance Miller, one of the Mitchell firm attorneys who represented Madison in the Peacock litigation.327  During a recent appearance in bankruptcy court, Miller had questioned the source of Hopkins' legal fees.  In particular, Miller suggested that Hopkins was paid with the proceeds from one of Madison's loans to Peacock.328  Hays also thought that Hopkins was embarrassed because Miller had forced Peacock to dismiss with prejudice the bankruptcy petition that Hopkins had filed on Peacock's behalf -- a major defeat for Peacock and Hopkins.329  
<P>As soon as Hopkins left her office, Hays telephoned Miller and recounted Hopkins' allegations.  Miller took contemporaneous notes of his conversation with Hays ("phone notes").330  Miller also discussed the allegations with two lawyers at the Mitchell firm, Tim Grooms, a more senior associate, and Jim Guy Tucker, a partner in the firm.331  In addition, at Tucker's suggestion, Miller drafted a memorandum to John Selig, the senior partner at the Mitchell firm ("memorandum").332  The three page memorandum, dated April 23, 1987, was intended to apprise Selig of Hopkins' allegations.333  Both documents were based entirely on Miller's April 21 conversation with Hays; Miller did not conduct any independent research or investigation.334
<P>The bulk of Hopkins' allegations concerned Tucker's relationship with Madison Guaranty and the Mitchell firm's conduct of the Peacock litigation.  For example, Hopkins threatened to seek to disqualify the Mitchell firm from the Peacock litigation based on a conflict of interest arising out of Tucker's business dealings with Madison Guaranty and McDougal.335  Hopkins also attacked the Mitchell firm's conduct of the litigation as "churn[ing] the files" to generate legal fees.336  Finally, Hopkins criticized the Mitchell firm's conduct of the litigation as "too dirty" and stated that he was considering resigning his representation of Peacock as a consequence.337  These allegations are not directly relevant to the Committee's investigation.
<P>One of Hopkins' allegations is pertinent to the Committee's inquiry.  According to Miller's phone notes and memorandum, Hopkins claimed that funds from a Madison Guaranty loan to Dixie Continental were used to make contributions to the Clinton campaign and that the state lease with Madison was related to the contributions.338  
<P>Hopkins' allegation is recounted in Miller's phone notes and his subsequent memorandum.  First, Miller's phone notes state:  
<P>Dixie loan went to Clinton Campaign
<P>Signed lease to state, 
<P>alot of people going to prison.339
<P>
In his memorandum, Miller expanded upon his phone notes.  The memorandum states:  
<P>Mr. Hopkins stated that a portion of the loan proceeds made to Dixie Continental Leasing went to Bill Clinton's campaign and that in return for the substantial campaign contribution, Bill Clinton assured Jim McDougal that a state agency would lease space from Madison at its headquarters on Main Street in Little Rock.340
<P>
These statements -- which were reported in the press in July 1995 -- appear to have provided the impetus for the Committee's investigation into the supposed relationship between the April 5, 1985 fundraiser and the State leases at Madison Guaranty.
<P><P>  (2)  There was no connection between the State leases at Madison Guaranty and the April 5, 1985 fundraiser

<P>On its face, Hopkins' allegation is certainly troubling.  However, upon examination, the record simply does not support the allegation.
<P>First and foremost, the timing of events is inconsistent with the allegation of a connection between the leases and the fundraiser.  As discussed above, the AHDA lease at Madison Guaranty was signed in April 1984.  The fundraiser was not held until April 1985, a full year later.  It strains credulity that Governor Clinton directed state agencies to lease space at Madison in the hope that sometime later -- much later as it turned out -- McDougal would hold a fundraiser for him.  Nor is there any basis to argue that the fundraiser was planned earlier but delayed.  Pillsbury, Madison reported that the fundraiser was not scheduled until a week before it took place.341  
<P>Second, every single person involved in the leasing process rejected the notion that Governor Clinton influenced the selection of Madison.  Three SBS officials -- Paul Mallard, Helen Herr and Morris Patterson -- all testified that Mallard made the decision unilaterally.  Wooten Epes, the Director of AHDA and ADFA, testified that Governor Clinton stayed out of the leasing process, even when Epes tried to draw him into it.  Nor did Betsey Wright or Bob Nash of the Governor's staff get involved.  John Latham, the president of Madison Guaranty, testified that "I know of no link" between the leases and the fundraiser.342  Moreover, Hays made inquiries at Madison but did not discover anything.343  In this regard, on April 27, 1987, Hays advised Marcy Taylor, a Mitchell, Williams lawyer that:  "No one here knows anything about it."344
<P>The majority apparently recognizes the implausibility of a connection between the fundraiser and the AHDA lease.  Instead, the majority has noted that ADFA Director Epes wrote to SBS Director Mallard on April 9, 1985 to request additional space, and has suggested that the resulting August 13, 1985 lease expansion at Madison must have been in recompense for the fundraiser.345  However, the facts simply do not support this claim.  The record clearly establishes that the agency needed the additional space, that it was cost-effective and efficient to seek additional space at Madison, and that there was no connection with the fundraiser.
<P>There can be no dispute that ADFA required additional office space.  From the outset of the leasing process, the agency stressed that it expected to expand, and needed office space that would accommodate expansion.346  Moreover, the timing of the expansion was entirely due to factors outside AHDA's control.  As noted previously, in April 1985, the Arkansas legislature enacted a wide ranging economic development package.  Part of this legislation transformed AHDA into ADFA.  Because ADFA's responsibilities were significantly broader than AHDA's, the new agency was authorized to hire several additional employees.  This, in turn, created a need for additional space.347  
<P>In light of the new legislation, Epes wrote to Mallard on April 9, 1985 to request additional office space.348  This request had no connection with the fundraiser; in fact, Epes had no idea that the fundraiser had been held.349  Rather, Epes apprised Mallard of the new legislation, and noted that AHDA expected to hire "three to four additional employees for Development Finance efforts."350  Epes further noted that AHDA had hired two additional employees since it moved into the Madison Guaranty building.  He therefore requested additional space to accommodate all the new employees.351  
<P>As SBS had anticipated when it obtained the initial lease, Madison Guaranty had additional space available at a competitive price.352  Thus, ADFA could expand without the expense and dislocation of moving.353  Helen Herr testified that this was the only sensible decision.  She stated succinctly:
<P>it would not have made any fiscal sense to relocate [AHDA] at that time, if space was available at a reasonable rate right next door.354
<P>
Accordingly, on August 13, 1985, ADFA leased 1,456 square feet of additional office space at Madison Guaranty.  The new space was contiguous with ADFA's existing space.  Although the price was slightly higher -- $9.32 per square foot compared to $8.50 for the existing space -- this amount included significant renovations.  The base rent remained the same.  According to Herr, the price was reasonable considering the work entailed in customizing the new space for ADFA.355
<P><P>  (3)  Hopkins' allegations of wrongdoing were directed at Madison Guaranty insiders, not at Governor Clinton or anyone associated with him

<P>As noted above, Hopkins told Hays that "a lot of people [would be] going to prison" as a consequence of wrongdoing at Madison.356  The Committee's investigation established that this statement referred to the operation of Madison Guaranty by the McDougals and other Madison Guaranty insiders, not to the Governor or people associated with his administration or his campaign.  Hays and Miller both testified that Hopkins' reference pertained only to Madison insiders, and did not pertain to Governor Clinton or anyone associated with him.*
<P>Miller's phone notes are silent as to whom Hopkins accused of wrongdoing.357 However, Miller's memorandum clarified that Hopkins' allegation was directed at McDougal and other Madison insiders.  Miller wrote:
<P>Mr. Hopkins went on to explain that there was substantial wrongdoing regarding the prior administration of Madison, that several people were `going to prison,' and that our firm will be severely embarrassed when a full disclosure is made and our firm is disqualified with potential sanctions imposed.358
<P>
Thus, the people who Hopkins' warned might be "going to prison" were "the prior administration of Madison" -- not Governor Clinton or anyone associated with him.359 
<P>Hays confirmed Miller's interpretation.  As a preliminary matter, Hopkins' statement regarding McDougal and the Madison insiders came as no surprise to Hays.  It was common knowledge that James McDougal had been forced out of Madison Guaranty, amidst allegations of rampant fraud.  As a Madison employee, Hays was acutely aware of these events.  She noted: 
<P>It's just that a lot of what he was saying, it wasn't news to me.  And maybe the particulars that statements like that people are going to prison, I mean that was widely known.  That was widely talked about and speculated about.360
<P>
Thus, Hays had no doubt that Hopkins' references to "wrongdoing" and "prison" applied to Madison insiders, not to Governor Clinton or anyone associated with his administration or campaign.361  Hays explained: 
<P>He was strictly talking about Madison related insiders . . . who had been running Madison.  That's who I understood him to be talking about, definitely.  . . .  Jim McDougal, one or more of the Henley brothers, John Latham.  That's essentially it.362

<P><P>  (4)  There was no impropriety by Governor Clinton or the Clinton campaign in connection with the Peacock contributions

<P> As noted previously, the contributions that Charles Peacock made at the April 5, 1985 fundraiser were legal on their face.  However, Arkansas campaign finance law prohibited contributions in the name of another person.363  Thus, the contributions violated the Arkansas election code.  
<P>Peacock admits that he made the contributions, but denies knowing that the contributions were illegal.364  He also denies that his contributions had any relation to state leases.365  Rather, Peacock claims he made the contributions for "a selfish reason" -- to help Ken obtain a state job after graduating from law school and to help the son of Landrum's friend procure a state scholarship.366  Neither event actually occurred.* 
<P>Although Peacock now admits that he made the contributions, at the time, there was no reason for Governor Clinton or anyone associated with his campaign to doubt that the contributions were made by Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum.  On the contrary, the campaign had every reason to believe that Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum did make the contributions.  The contribution checks identified Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum as the makers; no other names appeared on the checks.367  Moreover, Peacock wanted the campaign to believe the contributions came from his son and Landrum.368  Thus, the only person who could identify the actual contributor sought to conceal that fact.  
<P>The evidence shows that the campaign believed that the contributions came from Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum.  In a letter dated April 24, 1985, McDougal's secretary Sue Strayhorn provided Linda Dickson of the Governor's Office, with "addresses for checks you received through Madison for the Governor."369  The Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum contribution checks are among those listed in the letter.  This indicates that the Clinton campaign believed the checks were drawn by Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum, the individuals identified on the face of the checks.370  Shortly thereafter, the Clinton campaign sent Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum thank you letters at the addresses provided by Strayhorn.371  These letters were identical to the thank you letters that all the other contributors received.372  Charles Peacock did not receive a thank you letter.
<P>In interrogatory responses dated May 24, 1995, President Clinton stated that he had no knowledge regarding the source of funds for the contributions made in connection with the fundraiser.373  After a two-year review, on December 13, 1995, Pillsbury, Madison reported that it could not find any evidence to the contrary.374  The evidence provided to the Committee also is entirely consistent with the President's statement.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe that the President or anyone associated with him knew the source of funds for the Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum contributions.
<P><P>h.  Conclusion
<P>After extensive examination, the record is clear; Governor Clinton and everyone associated with his administration and his campaign acted entirely properly with respect to the State leases at Madison Guaranty.  The leases were signed in the normal course of business by the State officials responsible for leasing office space.  Governor Clinton did not influence the leasing process in any way.  The record indicates that only one lease -- the April 1984 ADHA lease -- even came to the Governor's attention.  Even then, he refused to intervene in the leasing process, and deferred to the decision of SBS Director Mallard.
<P> The record further shows that there was no connection between the State leases and the April 5, 1985 fundraiser at Madison Guaranty.  The AHDA lease was signed in April 1984, a full year before the fundraiser.  Thus, as a matter of timing, it is incredible to connect these events.  Nor could there have been any connection to the August 1985 ADFA lease expansion.  ADFA Director Epes -- who proposed the lease extension -- did not know that the fundraiser had taken place.  He simply requested space to house additional employees authorized during the legislative session.  The record also demonstrates that the revenue office lease signed in November 1985 was handled solely by the Department of Finance and Administration and SBS, without any involvement from the Governor's office.  Thus, there is no basis to connect the fundraiser with the leases.
<P>Finally, there is no evidence that Governor Clinton or anyone associated with his administration or his campaign was aware of the source of funds for the contributions Charles Peacock made in the names of Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum.  On the contrary, the record shows that the campaign treated the contributions like all other contributions.
<P>In sum, therefore, there is no evidence of impropriety by Governor Clinton  or anyone associated with him in connection with the State leases at Madison Guaranty or the April 5, 1985 fundraiser.


<P> 3.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MCDOUGAL RECEIVED SPECIAL
<P><P> TREATMENT FROM THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE COMMISSION

<P>It has been alleged that Governor Clinton pressured the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Division ("ABC") to provide favored treatment to James McDougal.  First, it has been alleged that Governor Clinton interceded with the ABC in support of McDougal's efforts to develop a microbrewery and brew pub on the IDC property.  Second, it has been alleged that Governor Clinton caused the ABC to promulgate a regulation permitting breweries to operate "tasting rooms."  The evidence, however, demonstrated that Governor Clinton never contacted the ABC with respect to the IDC brewery proposal.  The evidence further demonstrated that Governor Clinton played no part in the approval of the tasting room regulation.
<P><P>a.  No evidence that McDougal received special treatment in connection with his efforts to develop a brewery on the IDC property

<P>From 1982-86, William Lyon operated a small microbrewery in Little Rock, producing Riley's Red Lyon Beer.375  As discussed in section II.E, below, during the fall of 1985, McDougal tried to persuade Lyon to move his microbrewery to the IDC property.376  Specifically, McDougal asked Lyon to purchase a warehouse on the IDC property and convert it into a brewery.377  Lyon testified that he had little interest in McDougal's proposal, but agreed to consider it because Madison Guaranty had loaned him approximately $368,000 to finance the construction and expansion of the brewery.378
<P>In considering McDougal's proposal, Lyon first visited the IDC property with Seth Ward.*  Lyon then contacted the ABC to inquire about the proposed move.379  The ABC advised Lyon that the IDC property was situated in a "dry" section of Pulaski County -- which meant that alcohol could not be produced or sold on the IDC property.380  Plainly, this precluded placing a brewery on the IDC property.
<P> According to Lyon, when he informed McDougal that the IDC property was dry, McDougal responded that "he could take care of that . . . [t]hrough his many years in government, state government, his friendship with Bill Clinton . . . ."381  To the best of Lyon's knowledge, McDougal never followed up on his assurances.  Lyon testified that McDougal "did not take any steps, as far as I know, to take care of [the wet/dry problem]."382  
<P>However, in a memorandum to Seth Ward dated November 20, 1985, McDougal wrote:  Subject to approval by the ABC, Bill [Lyon] will place his brewery in the shell building, along with a tasting room.  I have spoken with the Governor on this matter and expect that it will be approved.383  
<P>
Based on this memorandum, it has been suggested that Governor Clinton agreed to intercede with the ABC to help McDougal obtain approval to move Lyon's brewery to the IDC property.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that Governor Clinton did not contact the ABC.
<P>McDougal's memorandum was replete with inaccuracies.  As an initial matter, Lyon testified that he never agreed to move his brewery to the IDC property.384  He merely considered the possibility out of deference to McDougal, his creditor.  Thus, the basic factual premise of the memorandum was erroneous.
<P>In addition, the ABC had no authority to approve the move; the prohibition on the sale or manufacture of alcoholic beverages on the IDC property was statutory, not regulatory.385  Thus, the suggestion that Governor Clinton interceded with the ABC to help McDougal makes no sense; there was nothing that Governor Clinton could have influenced the ABC to do.  
<P>  Moreover, Lyon stated that McDougal was a "salesman-type" who tended to "exaggerate" and to "brag" about his relationship with Governor Clinton.386  With respect to influencing Governor Clinton, Lyon added that:  "[McDougal] thought he could do anything.  Whether he could or not -- well, I guess history has proven that he couldn't."387  
<P>Even if McDougal did speak with Governor Clinton, moreover, there is no evidence that the Governor took any action to assist McDougal.  On the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that Governor Clinton did not assist McDougal.  Charles Singleton, the Director of the ABC,* confirmed that Governor Clinton "never contacted" him on any matter, and that no one at all contacted him regarding a possible brewery on the IDC property.388  ABC attorney Treeca Dyer also testified that she "didn't talk to the Governor's office."389  Nobody pressured Dyer or, to the best of her knowledge, her colleagues.390  Even Lyon did not believe that anyone in the Clinton administration interceded with the ABC in his behalf.391  
<P>In the end, the IDC property remained dry, and Lyon did not move his brewery to the IDC property.  As such, there is no evidence that anything improper occurred in connection with McDougal's efforts to develop a brewery on the IDC property.



<P><P>b.  Governor Clinton had no involvement in the ABC's approval of a regulation permitting breweries to operate tasting rooms  
<P>In late 1984, Lyon's microbrewery in Little Rock experienced financial problems.  To generate additional income, Lyon sought to operate a brew pub* at the microbrewery.392  Arkansas law, however, prohibited the retail sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises of manufacturing plants.
<P>Lyon lobbied his friend and state senator Jim Scott to introduce legislation to carve out an exception that would permit brew pubs.393  Senator Scott introduced the legislation during the 1985 legislative session.394  However, he withdrew the bill on February 18, 1985, after determining that the legislation would not pass.395
<P>At the same time he sought legislative relief, Lyon contacted the ABC to seek regulatory relief.396  On February 20, 1985, the ABC approved a regulation permitting "tasting rooms," in which beer manufacturers could give away free samples.  However, breweries still could not engage in retail beer sales. 
<P>It is unclear why McDougal would have been concerned with brewery regulations during this time; he did not purchase the IDC property until a year later.**  Nonetheless, on December 12, 1984, McDougal had sent Scott's proposal to Betsey Wright.397  In the accompanying letter, McDougal wrote that "Governor Clinton has made a commitment concerning this bill . . . ."398  Based on this letter, it has been alleged that Governor Clinton influenced the ABC to enact the tasting room regulation to help McDougal.  This allegation is quite a stretch.  At most, the letter showed that Governor Clinton may have favored legislation -- like that enacted in Arkansas and several neighboring states over the next few years399 -- to permit brew pubs.  The letter made no mention of the ABC or a tasting room regulation.400  In any event, the evidence showed that Governor Clinton played no part in the approval of the regulation.
<P>ABC Director Singleton -- who drafted and promulgated the tasting room regulation -- testified that the regulation was part of a routine process of updating and modernizing outdated regulations.401  He stated:
<P>It's just one of a group of regulations that we considered and adopted.  At the same time there had probably been 15 or 20 others, that other people would have been interested in and would have communicated about.  This one does not stand out in my mind over any of the others.402

<P>Singleton further testified that the impetus for the regulation came from the alcoholic beverage industry.403  No one from the Clinton Administration pressured him, or even contacted him, about this regulation.404  Moreover, Singleton would have recalled if the Governor or his staff had intervened.  He noted that:
<P>I rarely had any contact with the governor's office when I was over there.  We pretty much did our own thing as far as adopting regulations, and I don't recall ever being contacted by the governor's office about a regulation.405
<P>
Therefore, the evidence showed that Governor Clinton and his office played no part in the approval of the tasting room regulation.
<P>In addition, it should be noted that the tasting room regulation did not provide Lyon with the relief he sought.  The regulation permitted him to give away samples of his beer, but did not permit him to sell beer and food on the premises of his brewery, as he wished.406  Thus, the regulation did nothing to help Lyon generate additional income.  Lyon explained:  "It was less than I had [before the regulation was approved].  It just allowed me to give the beer away."407<P>  Finally, it has been suggested that the approval of the tasting room regulation was related to Senator Scott's decision to withdraw his bill two days earlier -- although it has not been demonstrated why this would cause concern.  In any event, Singleton expressly denied any connection between the bill and the regulation.408  He added that the ABC began crafting the regulation six months before it was promulgated -- in the fall of 1984.409  Thus, the alleged connection between the bill and the regulation rests on a coincidence of timing, and cannot withstand scrutiny.
<P> 4.  No Evidence that Governor Clinton Handled the Sewer Legislation Impropery 

<P>In 1987, Governor Clinton signed legislation to deregulate small sewer and water utilities.  The Majority has alleged that the legislation was designed to provide special treatment to the Castle Sewer and Water company ("CSW") and to protect the Rose Law Firm from exposure to civil liability.  The Arkansas Public Service Commission ("the Commission") and the entire Arkansas legislature supported the legislation.  Furthermore, passage of the legislation was fully justified on the merits.
<P>Sam Bratton, the current chairman of the Commission, served as Governor Clinton's liaison to the Commission from 1979-1980 and from 1983-1989.  Bratton first heard of CSW during Arkansas's 1987 legislative session, when Clinton vetoed House Bill 1780.  Bratton had recommended the veto because he and Commission General Counsel Doug Strock considered the bill to be "special and local legislation" that violated the state constitution by specifically exempting CSW from Commission regulation.  To overcome this objection, the sponsors of House Bill 1780 introduced during the 1987 special session House Bill 1047, which exempted all small utilities throughout the state from regulation by the Commission.  Virtually identical to a bill that Strock had proposed in 1985 and 1986, the legislature passed the new bill unanimously.  Governor Clinton then followed the recommendations of Bratton and the Commission by signing the bill into law.
<P><P>a.  The Impact on Small Utilities
<P>During the 1987 legislative session, Arkansas Representatives William Walker and Mike Wilson introduced House Bill 1780, which stated in relevant part that:
<P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the laws of this State regulating public utilities, the provision of this Act shall govern the registration, accounting, and rates only of a privately owned public utility providing sewer and/or water services to one or more customers at a location within the (10) miles of the corporate limits of a City of the First Class which as a population in excess of 140,000 persons.410
<P>
In 1987, the only city in Arkansas with a population of 140,000 was Little Rock and CSW was apparently the only privately owned sewer and water utility within 10 miles of Little Rock.  Thus, the effect of House Bill 1780 would have been to exempt CSW from regulation by the Commission.  
<P>Representative Walker apparently believed that the deregulation of CSW would have resulted in lower utility rates for his constituents.  According to Bratton: 
<P>Bill Walker's interest in this matter apparently arises from the fact that this utility company could sell water to the City of Wrightsville at wholesale at a price substantially less than Wrightsville in currently purchasing water from the City of Little Rock.411

Wrightsville residents were paying "fairly high" rates to buy their water from Little Rock and to have it transported to their municipality.  These higher rates were especially burdensome because Wrightsville had a "low socioeconomic base."412  Walker therefore wanted "to find an alternative water supply source for the city of Wrightsville and apparently Castle Water and Sewer was one of the alternatives that was potentially available."413  House Bill 1780 was thus an attempt to provide Wrightsville residents with access to less expensive sources of water.  The Clinton Administration had no role in initiating or drafting this legislation.414  
<P>House Bill 1780 passed both houses of the Arkansas legislature without a dissenting vote.415  According to Bratton, Governor Clinton's top aide on matters involving the Commission, Clinton received no pressure to support or oppose the bill.416   Because Arkansas had no pocket veto provision, House Bill 1780 would have become law automatically even if Governor Clinton had taken no action.417   Nevertheless, Bratton advised Clinton to veto the bill.  Bratton considered the law to be "special legislation" because it applied only to CSW despite the existence of similarly situated utilities.418   The Walker-Wilson bill therefore "contravened a provision in the state constitution that prohibited special local legislation and therefore it was constitutionally defective."419   
<P>Commission General Counsel Strock shared Bratton's concerns about the constitutionality of the Walker-Wilson bill.  In an internal memorandum stating his opinion on the merits of House Bill 1780, Strock concluded:
<P>The bill is obviously designed to apply only to some utility/ies within ten miles of Little Rock.  It is really a kind of special legislation, phrased with an eye to meeting constitutional prohibitions against special legislation.  It may possibly be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge as special legislation, however.420

<P>Governor Clinton adopted Bratton's and Strock's reasoning with respect to the Walker-Wilson bill.  On April 8, 1987, Clinton vetoed House Bill 1780, and released the following statement:
<P>Amendment 14 to the Arkansas Constitution prohibits the enactment of special or local legislation.  By its terms, House Bill 1780 would partially deregulate only certain sewer and water services located within ten (10) miles of the City of Little Rock.  There appears to be no rational basis for a classification which singles out for deregulation such utilities and does not apply to other privately owned sewer and water services located within the State of Arkansas.

<P>After the veto, several individuals contacted Bratton.  R.D. Randolph, a prominent Arkansas contractor, voiced his displeasure to Bratton and Nancy Hernreich,* the Governor's scheduler, noting that the bill had faced little or no opposition in the legislature.421  Tucker and McDougal also contacted Bratton.  In addition, Tucker sent a letter to Governor Clinton dated April 24, 1987, which stated that "R.D. Randolph, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, and I were all very disappointed that this non-controversial bill was vetoed.  If a special session does become necessary, we ask that your call include this legislation."422    
<P>In the summer of 1987, Clinton called a special session of the legislature to revise legislation that provided an income tax credit for contributions to institutions of higher education.423  During the special session, Representative Wilson introduced House Bill 1047, which corrected the constitutional defect contained in House Bill 1780 by exempting all small water and sewer utilities from Commission regulation.424   The bill passed in the state House of Representatives by a vote of 97-0 and passed in the state Senate by a vote of 33-0.  According to Bratton, no party expressed opposition to the legislation.425  On June 12, 1987, Governor Clinton signed the bill into law, which then became known as Act 37.
<P>Act 37 was virtually identical to a bill Strock had proposed in January 1985 and had drafted in June 1986 for the 1987 legislative session.*  Strock summarized his 1986 proposal as a bill that 
<P>redefines `public utility' to exclude small water and sewer companies not meeting the criteria for Class A companies.  The bill allows the customers of such utilities to condemn the facilities, if necessary, by forming a suburban improvement district, to compensate for whatever protection is afforded currently by [Commission] jurisdiction, assuming the [Commission] has jurisdiction.426
<P>
Strock's recommendation to deregulate small sewer and water utilities preceded Madison Financial's purchase of the Castle Grande property by eight months and preceded the formation of CSW by eleven months.427  Strock's recommendation preceded Clinton's support for House Bill 1047 by more than two years.  Given these circumstances, the legislation ultimately enacted was not intended to provide any special benefit to CSW or to its owners.
 
<P>    b.  Potential Litigation Involving the Rose Law Firm
<P>It has been alleged that Governor Clinton "reversed" his veto and signed House Bill 1047 to shield Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm from liability for providing Madison Guaranty with questionable legal advice.  The evidence does not support this allegation.
<P>The Rose Law Firm represented Madison Guaranty on public utility matters arising out of the IDC/Castle Grande transaction.  In this regard, Richard Donovan, a Rose Law Firm attorney, drafted a February 17, 1986 memorandum to Mrs. Clinton which concluded that "Madison Guaranty/IDC, in all likelihood, meets the statutory and common law definition of a `public utility,'" but that many small utilities are regulated by the Commission only if they formally seek regulation or if a patron lodges a formal complaint against the utility.  "The risk of non-compliance with [Commission] regulations," Donovan wrote, "is civil sanctions."  Therefore, "costs saved by non-regulation may make the risks palatable."428  After this memorandum was provided to Madison Guaranty, Madison Financial decided not to register the Castle Grande sewer and water system as a public utility.  Tucker later threatened sue Madison Guaranty to rescind CSW's mortgage due to the failure to register CSW with the Commission before conveying the underlying property to CSW.
<P>There is no evidence, however, that Bratton knew that Tucker's threatened litigation might have implicated the Rose Law Firm.  Tucker did not mention the Rose Law Firm or Mrs. Clinton in his conversation with Bratton about the potential litigation.429  Bratton's May 19, 1987 memorandum to the Governor corroborated his recollection.  Written almost contemporaneously to the conversation with Tucker, the memorandum stated, 
<P>According to Tucker, if the legislation exempting certain water and sewer companies from [Commission] regulation is not enacted in the special session, litigation will probably be initiated between Madison Guaranty and the company owning the utility . . . .430  
<P>
Tucker did not mention that the legislation was essential to the consummation of CSW's purchase of the sewer and water system at Castle Grande in February 1986.*  Nor did Tucker give Bratton any "reason to think there was any tie between [the sewer and water utilities] legislation and the Rose Law Firm."431
<P>Robert Shults, the attorney Tucker hired to represent CSW, similarly testified that the "Rose Law Firm never figured into anything I was involved in this matter."432   It does not appear that the law firm billed Madison Guaranty for Mrs. Clinton's time in reviewing the memorandum.  Most importantly, the evidence indicates that Governor Clinton signed House Bill 1047 not to shield the Rose Law Firm from potential liability -- assuming he was aware of any such risk -- but to enact legislation that was supported unanimously by disinterested parties like the Commission and both houses of the state legislature.  Approximately one year before the Rose Law Firm rendered its legal opinion and before the Castle Grande property transaction occurred, Doug Strock proposed, in essence, the legislation that Governor Clinton ultimately signed.  As such, the evidence demonstrated that potential litigation involving the Rose Law Firm had no influence on the decision to sign House Bill 1047.
<P> 5.  No Evidence that Arkansas Health Department Sanitarians Were Reassigned Improperly

<P><P> a.  Background
<P>In 1983 Madison Financial Corporation was selling tracts of land in a residential development called Maple Creek Farms in Saline County, Arkansas.433  The State Health Department had conducted a preliminary review of the project and determined "that the soil was unsuitable for supporting subsurface individual sewage disposal systems" such as septic tanks.434  The Health Department initially recommended installation of a public sewer system for the entire development, but because of cost considerations the Department agreed not to require a public sewer system if all tracts in the development were larger than three acres.435  Arkansas law did not require large tract developments, defined as developments with lots of three acres and larger, to perform preliminary soil studies or obtain approvals from the State Health Department before selling the lots.436
<P>On June 23, 1983 the Health Department entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Madison Financial Corporation to memorialize "the understanding of the Saline County Health Department that all lots contained in Maple Creek Estates are to be a minimum of three acres" and that each lot would be individually evaluated for an acceptable septic tank disposal system.437  An accompanying transmittal letter to McDougal from Saline County Sanitarian Lex A. Dobbins suggested that an approved individual sewage disposal permit be obtained prior to any construction to allow for proper planning of the plumbing and sewage disposal system for each home.438
<P>The Memorandum of Agreement permitted the lots in Maple Creek Farms to be sold, but it did not resolve the soil quality and sewage disposal problems at the development.  As noted above, under the Memorandum of Agreement the Health Department was required to review each individual tract when a purchaser began construction and to work with the purchaser to develop a satisfactory sewage disposal system.439  The poor soil quality continued to cause problems as lot purchasers built homes and installed individual sewage disposal systems.  It also appears that some homes were constructed and plumbing was installed before individual sewage disposal permits were obtained, creating problems for "proper installation of the sewage disposal systems."440  In a letter dated February 21, 1984, Dobbins brought this problem to McDougal's attention, suggested that permits be obtained prior to construction, and asked "that you consider an over-all plan of development that would provide public sewerage for any area in Maple Creek in which the malfunction of individual sewage disposal systems may occur and thus constitute a public health hazard."441
<P>In 1984 McDougal created a new subdivision within Maple Creek that was to be served by a community sewer system -- "a subdivision within the development" that would include lots smaller than three acres.442  According to Health Department records, "[t]he Department felt that a workable agreement could be reached by both parties as to an acceptable plan of development for the future utilization of public sewers" at Maple Creek.443  The Health Department entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Maple Creek Farms, Inc. on April 26, 1984,444 in which the Health Department agreed to issue temporary individual sewage disposal permits* and Madison Financial agreed to initiate steps for the formation of a sewer improvement district to provide a community sewerage system.445  McDougal executed the Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of Maple Creek Farms, but it appears that he was not happy about being required to provide a community sewer system for a portion of the development.  William A. Teer, Director of the Health Department's Division of Sanitarian Services, recalls attending the meeting at which the Memorandum of Understanding was executed and observing that McDougal "was extremely brash, disrespectful, [and] arrogant, and that after signing the document "he [threw] it back across at me . . . and said, as far as he's concerned, it wasn't worth the paper it was written on."446
<P>On July 3, 1984, Teer wrote to McDougal about the "past problems that we have encountered at Maple Creek in regard to malfunctions of individual on-site sewage disposal systems."447  Teer's letter recommended site protection and site drainage procedures to alleviate future problems "until community sewers are made available."448  On July 17, 1984, McDougal wrote back to Teer and, after apologizing for not responding to Teer more promptly because he had been away for a vacation, advised Teer:  "We are in agreement on your recommendations as to site protection and site drainage and are in the process of the continued implementation of these recommendations."449  Another letter from McDougal to the Health Department, dated July 6, 1984, advises the Department that Bob Holloway (a consulting engineer for Madison Financial)450 would "prepare the preliminary engineering data on the proposed pumped affluent sewer system for Maple Creek Farms."451
<P><P>b.  McDougal's Worsening Relations with the Health Department

<P>Documents and testimony obtained by the Special Committee indicate that Madison Financial's posture may not have been as cooperative as the July 1984 letters from McDougal to the Health Department described above suggest, however.  An August 31, 1984 letter to McDougal from an attorney for Madison Financial named Larry Crane reports that Crane had visited the Health Department, reviewed files relating to Maple Creek, and "told them that while your company did not intend to file suit immediately on anything, you had become concerned enough about the continuing changes in requirements that it was necessary to retain me to educate myself about the situation in case litigation were necessary."452  Teer recalls a meeting with Crane at that time at which Crane told Teer that Dobbins had been harassing McDougal.453
<P>Dobbins recalled Crane visiting the Saline County Health Department offices to review documentation on Maple Creek, which were public records.  Dobbins could not recall a discussion with Crane about statements by Dobbins to potential lot buyers about the sewage disposal problems, but he acknowledged that he had told some potential buyers about the problems.  Dobbins testified that he did so "in the course of business" and that if a buyer asked him about Maple Creek Farms he "would give them my opinion, my professional opinion."454  Dobbins also acknowledged that he "may have had a similar discussion with another lending institution."455  These actions by Dobbins may have influenced McDougal to retain an attorney and, ultimately, to request a meeting with the Governor to complain about Dobbins, as discussed below.*
<P>In December 1984 McDougal copied Health Department Sanitarian Services Division Director Teer on a letter to Holloway which stated that "the earliest practical time to undertake construction [of a pressure sewer system at Maple Creek Farms] is after cessation of the spring rains in 1985."456  That letter also states that Madison Financial intended to begin construction of the sewer system at that time.457  The Health Department did not set a deadline for construction of a community sewer system, and discussions regarding technical specifications continued into 1985.458  In 1985 development activity at Maple Creek "was slowing down quite a bit" and both the Health Department and McDougal apparently took a "wait-and-see" attitude about the sewage disposal problems, with the Health Department continuing to issue temporary permits.459
<P>It appears that relations between Dobbins and McDougal worsened during 1985, however.  A July 1985 memorandum to McDougal from Bruce Watson of Maple Creek Farms reports on a meeting at the development with Dobbins's supervisor, J. P. Jones, at which Jones apparently overruled Dobbins and approved two septic tank systems that Dobbins had previously refused to approve.460  The memorandum also states that Watson believed "the outcome of this meeting helped readjust Lex's attitude towards Maple Creek."461  Dobbins testified that he does not recall that particular meeting, but does recall that Jones made more than one trip to Maple Creek "to mediate discussions" between Dobbins and representatives of Madison Financial.462  Dobbins testified that throughout the balance of 1985 disagreements continued to arise concerning him issuing further temporary permits, and he "wasn't really pleased with the way the development was going anyway, with the lack of information being given to the buyers [and their] method of installing sewage disposal systems."463
<P>These disagreements apparently came to a head in January 1986, causing McDougal to request a meeting with Governor Clinton.
<P><P>c.  McDougal Requests a Meeting with Governor Clinton

<P>McDougal requested a meeting with Governor Clinton on January 14, 1986.  A January 14 memorandum464 to Governor Clinton from his scheduling secretary, Nancy Hernreich, reports a request from McDougal for a meeting* with the governor.  Handwritten notations on the memorandum indicate that the meeting was scheduled for Saturday, January 18, 1986.  Copies of the governor's schedule for Saturday, January 18, 1986, show a meeting with McDougal scheduled for 11:00 a.m. at the Governor's Mansion.465  A January 15 telephone message for McDougal from Nancy Hernreich says "can see Governor Sat. a.m. at 11:00 -- go by Mansion."466
<P>McDougal prepared a memorandum on the Health Department matter in advance of the January 18 meeting with Governor Clinton.  A memorandum dated January 17, 1986, from Jim McDougal, with no addressee, lists the names of Teer, Dobbins, and two other state sanitarians and requests approval of two subdivisions in Pulaski and White counties.467  The memorandum also requests:  "Strict written instructions from Teer to county sanitarians to not discuss our subdivision with our customers."468  The latter request appears to relate to Dobbins's contacts with prospective purchasers of Maple Creek Farms lots, discussed above.
<P>It seems that McDougal gave the January 17 memorandum to Governor Clinton at the meeting on Saturday, January 18, and the memorandum then was misplaced for a time.  A January 30, 1986 memorandum to Governor Clinton from Janice Choate (then the governor's office liaison with the Health Department)469 titled "Jim McDougal" reports on a telephone conversation Choate had with McDougal in which:  "He told me to look for the memo he gave you that had all the complaints outlined and that I could find that memo in the coat pocket of the jacket you had on when he saw you Sat. morn."470  (A later reference in the memorandum to "Tuesday of this week" indicates that the Saturday morning meeting referenced in the memorandum is the January 18 meeting.)
<P>It appears that a second version of the memorandum was prepared after the first memorandum was misplaced.  A version dated January 18, 1986, which does not include the "From: Jim McDougal" heading, also was produced to the Special Committee.471  In addition to the omission of the heading, the wording of the January 18 memorandum differs slightly from the version dated January 17, and a handwritten note on the January 18 version states "Rasco -- this is McDougal's memo."  (Carol Rasco was another aide to Governor Clinton at that time.)472   Finally, a January 28 [1986] telephone message to McDougal from Choate reads "copy of memo"473 and suggests that Choate may have been trying to obtain another copy of the memorandum from McDougal.  In any event, the two versions of the memorandum described above were produced to the Special Committee, and there are no material differences between the two versions.
<P>Choate and Rasco looked into McDougal's complaint and the matters set out in the January 17/January 18 memorandum.  A February 25 memorandum to Rasco from Choate reports that Choate had spoken with Tom Butler (the Deputy Director of the Health Department) and Butler had met with the four sanitarians listed in the McDougal memorandum.474  According to Choate's February 25 memorandum, Dobbins told Butler that "he had no recollection of any kind of difficulty between him and McDougal," and Butler advised Choate that "the Health Dept. has not badgered McDougal about this."475  Another February 25, 1986 memorandum to Choate from Rasco indicates that a meeting was scheduled for Tuesday, March 4, at 2 p.m. with Butler,* Teer, Jerry Hill (Teer's supervisor), and Dr. Ben Saltzman (who was then the director of the State Health Department).476  
<P>Choate prepared a memorandum to Governor Clinton on the "Jim McDougal/Health Department" matter, dated March 4, 1986, the day the governor met with McDougal and the Health Department officials.  That memorandum reports that Choate had spoken with Health Department officials "in regard to the memo you received from McDougal" and was assured that "they have made a concerted effort to be courteous to Mr. McDougal and his employees."477  Choate's memorandum closes by noting that the Health Department officials were "puzzled by Jim McDougal's memo," and that Choate had no reason to doubt what they were saying.478  McDougal's position on the treatment he had received from the Health Department was very different, however, as he made clear at the March 4 meeting.
<P><P>d.  McDougal Meets with Governor Clinton and Health Department Officials

<P>Governor Clinton met with McDougal and the Health Department officials on March [4], 1986.  Choate attended the meeting as the governor's staff liaison with the Health Department.  Butler recalls that at the outset of the meeting Governor Clinton suggested that the group "lay the problem out" and try to come to an agreement on how to solve the problem, "at which time McDougal went ballistic."479  Butler testified that McDougal's "tirade" lasted about five minutes and included personal accusations against Dobbins, Butler, and Dr. Saltzman.480  Choate's contemporaneous notes of the meeting confirm Butler's recollection of McDougal's conduct.  Choate's notes read "Mar. 4 -- McDougal agitated -- nothing but duplicity & trickery from the Hlth. Dpt. -- you're here to gang [up] on me -- Lex Dobbins has made a concerted effort of intimidation."481  The notes go on to recount more personal attacks on Dobbins and McDougal's assertion that he had been "stabbed in the back."  Choate testified that she recalls McDougal "was real upset and agitated."482
<P>Butler and Choate both testified that Governor Clinton became angry with McDougal's conduct and reprimanded him.  Choate testified that "[a]fter McDougal got through ranting and raving," the Governor told McDougal that the way he was talking to professional staff was "inexcusable," and that Governor Clinton "defended us and them [the Health Department staff]."483  Choate recalled that Governor Clinton told McDougal "we are not cutting you any slack -- those may not be the exact words, but something to that effect -- that these people are professional and they will revisit this with you and get it straightened out, do what you are supposed to do."484  Butler remembers that the Governor "got real red," which indicated he was angry, and:  "From that time, McDougal calmed down.  I think it was pretty obvious he had said the wrong thing.  The meeting then calmed down to a normal meeting."485
<P>At the conclusion of the meeting the Health Department officials agreed to take another look at the McDougal real estate developments.  Butler recalled:
<P>The end result was I told him we would be willing to go back out and take another look at the property, because we are not beyond making a mistake.  That was the agreement at the time, and the Governor said, I think we can live with this, and you go back out and look at the property.486
Butler also testified that in a private discussion with Butler immediately after the meeting Governor Clinton made clear that McDougal was to receive no special treatment:
<P>He said, I apologize for the way the man acted, I had no idea he would act this way.  He said, you go do what you have to do and you will never hear another word from me.  That was my last conversation with the Governor on the matter.487
No decision was made at the meeting* to reassign Dobbins or the other sanitarians.488
<P><P>e.  The Reassignment of the Sanitarians
<P>After the March 4 meeting Butler decided to reassign the four sanitarians whose names were listed in McDougal's memorandum.  Butler testified that he consulted with Saltzman and Hill, then met with Teer and the sanitarians,* and informed them that the sanitarians were being reassigned.489  Butler testified that the decision to reassign the sanitarians was consistent with the Health Department's usual practice when particular employees were the subject of complaints:
<P>We have done it in the past and we have done it since then.  If we get to a point in time where we are not dealing with the problem, we rotate sanitarians, we move one on one program and move one back in.  Then if they come back and tell us our sanitarian has it out for us, that won't hold water at that point in time, because we have moved another one in.490
The other witnesses examined by the Special Committee also testified that the reassignment of the sanitarians was consistent with normal Health Department practice and was not the result of any direction or influence from the governor's office.
<P>Teer confirmed that Butler made the decision to reassign the sanitarians.491  He also confirmed that Butler was the Health Department official who normally makes decisions on reassignments.492  Teer testified that the sanitarians who had been responsible for the various McDougal developments, including Maple Creek Farms, were reassigned "in order to show that we were trying to be fair with Mr. McDougal and . . . trying to show that we're not being impartial [sic] or anything like that."493  The Health Department's normal practice is that "[i]f an accusation comes up against a sanitarian or us being against a person, trying to harass them, trying to be arbitrary, he [Butler] will reassign somebody in the hope that the reassignment will show that we are trying to be fair."494
<P>Teer also testified that the same policy had been followed by the Health Department since the 1970's and has been followed since, with one such reassignment occurring in 1995.495  It does not appear that Teer, who concurred in the decision to reassign the sanitarians, was influenced in any way by the meeting with Governor Clinton, which he did not attend.496  In fact, Teer recalled that he did not learn what had been said at the meeting with Governor Clinton until after the sanitarians had been reassigned.497  Moreover, Teer testified that "if it [the decision to reassign the sanitarians] had come from the governor's office, as much as we talk shop . . . I think we would have heard it after this much time."498
<P>Even Lex Dobbins, the sanitarian who was the subject of McDougal's ire at the March 4 meeting, testified that "[i]t was standard operating procedure any time a developer complained to the state Health Department about unfair treatment, the sanitarian would be reassigned."499  Dobbins described this policy as an effort by the agency to establish "a level playing field to show no bias in the way we regulated the developers."500  Dobbins testified that the policy of reassigning sanitarians was followed whether or not senior Health Department officials agreed with the positions taken by the sanitarian who was the subject of a complaint by a developer.501  Dobbins also testified that while McDougal or his representatives told him "they were friends of the governor," they "never threatened me with the governor or their relationship with the governor in any way."502  Finally, Dobbins confirmed that the outcome would have been the same -- reassignment of the sanitarians -- if McDougal had complained only to the Health Department and had not requested a meeting with or otherwise involved the Governor:  "The decision to remove us would have been the same if Socks had been sitting in the chair."503
<P><P>f.  Conclusions
<P>The documents and testimony collected by the Special Committee show that the Maple Creek Farms project had recurring sewage disposal problems and there was extensive contact between Health Department officials and James McDougal and his associates.  The evidence also shows that, with or without justification, McDougal developed a strong personal animus against Dobbins and eventually complained to Governor Clinton.  The evidence also shows that Governor Clinton followed up on McDougal's complaint and arranged a meeting at which McDougal could communicate to Health Department officials the concerns he had about unfair treatment.
<P>Governor Clinton did not take any action on McDougal's behalf, however, either at the meeting with the Health Department officials or thereafter.  To the contrary, Governor Clinton reprimanded McDougal for his behavior at the meeting, defended the Health Department's professional staff, and told McDougal to work with the Health Department to resolve the problems.  Most important, immediately after the meeting Governor Clinton made a special effort to let Butler know that McDougal was not to receive any special treatment and that Clinton would support whatever action the Health Department decided to take.
<P>There is no evidence that Governor Clinton played any role in the decision to reassign the sanitarians.  All of the evidence supports the conclusion that Butler made the decision to reassign the sanitarians and that his action was consistent with standard Health Department practice in such situations.  There is no evidence that Governor Clinton or anyone else in the Governor's office played a role in the reassignment of the sanitarians.  The matter appears to have been handled routinely, and the meeting with Governor Clinton does not appear to have affected the Health Department's subsequent handling of the matter.
<P>The record on this matter is clear on the key issues:  Nothing suggests that Governor Clinton or anyone else in the Governor's office took any action on McDougal's behalf, and nothing suggests that McDougal ever received any special treatment from the Health Department.  Governor Clinton supported his staff and took special care to make sure that they understood that McDougal should not receive any favorable treatment.
<P> 6.  No Impropriety in Connection with Williams Lyon's Appointment to the
<P><P> Banking Board or His Subsequent Resignation

<P>From approximately 1978-86, William C. Lyon owned Pine State Bank, which he described as the smallest bank in Arkansas.504  On January 2, 1980, Governor Clinton appointed Lyon to the Arkansas Banking Board ("Banking Board").  Four years later, Lyon resigned at Governor Clinton's request.  Lyon's resignation became effective following a Banking Board meeting on January 17, 1984.  
<P>Lyon has suggested that the circumstances surrounding his resignation were improper.  In particular, Lyon testified that James McDougal offered to secure his appointment to the Arkansas Savings & Loan Board ("S&L Board") in exchange for his resignation from the Banking Board.  According to Lyon, McDougal wanted him to join the S&L Board in order to approve a preferred stock offering that Madison Guaranty was pursuing at the time.  However, the other evidence collected by the Special Committee contradicts Lyon's testimony because Madison Guaranty did not pursue a preferred stock offering until more than a year after Lyon resigned from the Banking Board.  Even if Lyon's testimony were accurate, moreover, there is no evidence that anything improper occurred in connection with Lyon's resignation from the Banking Board.  Governor Clinton did not appoint Lyon to the S&L Board -- or anything else -- following his resignation from the Banking Board.
<P><P>a.  Background
<P>According to Lyon, in late 1979, during Governor Clinton's first term in office, James McDougal approached him and inquired whether he would be interested in an appointment to the Arkansas Banking Board.505  At the time, McDougal served on Governor Clinton's staff, and would have been acting in his official capacity when he approached Lyon.506  Lyon viewed the Banking Board as a "plum appointment," and readily agreed to serve.507  Shortly thereafter, Governor Clinton appointed him to the Banking Board.508  
<P>In late 1983, during Clinton's second term, McDougal again approached Lyon.  This time, however, McDougal asked Lyon to resign from the Banking Board.  Lyon testified that McDougal told him that Governor Clinton wanted to give Lyon's seat on the Banking Board to "somebody [who] had contributed a large sum of money" to the Governor's 1982 campaign.509  In return for his resignation, Lyon testified, McDougal promised to arrange his appointment to the S&L Board.  In addition, McDougal told Lyon that, upon his appointment to the S&L Board, McDougal wanted him to vote to approve a preferred stock offering by Madison Guaranty.  Lyon recalled that McDougal "was trying extremely hard to get a stock issue, a preferred stock issue through the State of Arkansas" at the time.510  
<P>Lyon testified that he refused to resign at McDougal's request.  He told McDougal he would resign if Governor Clinton asked him directly, but not otherwise.511  Lyon added that he responded "hell no" to McDougal's suggestion that he vote to approve the preferred stock offering.512  
<P>Lyon recalled that sometime in the next "month or two," Governor Clinton called him at his office at Pine State Bank and asked him to resign.513  The Governor thanked Lyon for his service, but told him that he "needed the appointment."514  He was "very nice" and "a gentleman" during this conversation.515  Nonetheless, Lyon resented being asked to resign.516 
<P>Governor Clinton did not tell Lyons why he wanted to replace him or discuss whom he planned to appoint in Lyon's place.517  He made no mention of campaign contributions or contributors.518  Nor did Governor Clinton mention the possibility of appointing Lyon to the S&L Board or a proposed stock offering by Madison Guaranty.519  Lyon was not appointed to the S&L Board.
<P><P>b.  Lyon's testimony conflicts with the evidence
<P>In his testimony, Lyon was emphatic that McDougal wanted him to join the S&L Board to approve a preferred stock offering from Madison Guaranty, and that the preferred stock offering was a high priority for McDougal.  Lyon stated that:
<P>[McDougal] was trying extremely hard to get a stock issue, a preferred stock issue through the State of Arkansas.  It was quite an unusual issue.  He came over and asked me to resign and to serve on the savings and loan board, that he was bound and determined to get the stock issue through so that he could get his capital increased.  It was a preferred stock deal.520
<P>
However, this testimony conflicts with all the other evidence collected by the Committee regarding the timing of the preferred stock offering.  
<P>Banking Board records show that Lyon left the Banking Board following the January 17, 1984 meeting.521  Lyon testified that he spoke with McDougal two months before Governor Clinton called to request his resignation.522  As such, Lyon's conversation with McDougal would have occurred in late 1983 or early 1984.  There is no evidence that Madison Guaranty was considering a preferred stock offering in late 1983.  On the contrary, the evidence establishes that Madison Guaranty did not explore a preferred stock offering until early 1985.  
<P>The earliest evidence that Madison Guaranty took steps to issue preferred stock is a memorandum dated April 3, 1985 from Charles Handley of the Arkansas Securities Department to Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett.523  The memorandum -- which recounts a phone call from Davis Fitzhugh of Madison Guaranty to another Securities Department staff member -- indicates that Madison Guaranty had just begun its consideration of a preferred stock offering.524  A second memorandum dated April 3, 1985, prepared by a Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") official, confirms the timing.  That memorandum describes a meeting between Madison Guaranty personnel and FHLBB officials in Dallas, and states that the Madison Guaranty personnel advised the FHLBB that Madison Guaranty planned to issue preferred stock to satisfy more stringent net worth requirements imposed by an FHLBB regulation that took effect on March 31, 1985.525  The timing is further confirmed by a memorandum dated April 16, 1985 from Fitzhugh to Madison Guaranty's President, John Latham, which describes Fitzhugh's preliminary research on preferred stock offerings by S&Ls.526  Thereafter, in late April 1985, Madison Guaranty retained the Rose Law Firm to work on the preferred stock offering.527  
<P>As noted above, Lyon testified that McDougal was aggressively pursing a preferred stock offering by the end of 1983.  There is no evidence whatsoever to support that claim.  On the contrary, the evidence shows that Madison Guaranty did not consider issuing preferred stock until April 1985, nearly a year and a half later.  In this regard, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro concluded that "[i]n the spring of 1985, Madison Guaranty became interested in issuing preferred stock."528  Consequently, Lyon's testimony directly conflicts with the evidence.
<P><P>c.  No evidence that Governor Clinton had knowledge of Lyon's conversation with McDougal or did anything improper

<P>Even if Lyon's testimony were accurate, it would only establish that McDougal schemed to benefit Madison Guaranty.  There is no evidence that Governor Clinton was aware of McDougal's supposed machinations.529  Even Lyon conceded, "I don't know if Bill Clinton knew anything about it or not."530  In fact, the evidence shows that Governor Clinton had no such knowledge, and that he acted completely properly.
<P>As an initial matter, Governor Clinton had every right to seek Lyon's resignation.  Governor Clinton had appointed Lyon to the Banking Board in the first instance, and there was no legal or ethical impediment to Governor Clinton's replacing Lyon if he saw fit.  Moreover, the Governor handled the matter in an appropriate way.  Although Lyon testified that Governor Clinton angered him by seeking his resignation, he conceded that the Governor acted entirely properly during their conversation.531  Governor Clinton simply thanked Lyon for his service and for his willingness to step aside.532  He gave no indication that he knew about Lyon's alleged conversation with McDougal.533  He never mentioned the S&L Board or the preferred stock offering.534  Nor did he appoint Lyon to the S&L Board, or anything else.  
<P>Therefore, the record establishes that Governor Clinton took no action to further McDougal's alleged scheme to obtain approval for a preferred stock offering.  On the contrary, the evidence strongly suggests that Governor Clinton was not even aware of McDougal's scheme, if in fact it existed -- and the evidence suggests it did not. 
<P> 7.  No Evidence of Impropriety in Regulation of Madison Bank and Trust by the Arkansas State Banking Department

<P>In October 1980 James McDougal and a group of investors purchased a controlling interest in the Bank of Kingston, a small bank in Kingston, Arkansas.  McDougal then changed the bank's name to Madison Bank & Trust Company ("Madison Bank").*  As a state chartered institution, Madison Bank was regulated by both the Arkansas State Banking Department (the "ASB") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").535  In 1983 Marlin Jackson was the State Bank Commissioner.536 
<P>In 1983 Jackson informed Governor Clinton of regulatory problems at Madison Bank.  Jackson testified that he told the Governor about Madison Bank's problems as "a litmus test" to see if Governor Clinton would seek to influence Jackson and obtain favorable treatment for a political supporter.  (Jackson was aware that McDougal had been a member of Governor Clinton's staff during Clinton's first term in office, 1979-80.)  Governor Clinton passed Jackson's litmus test.  Jackson testified that Governor Clinton responded:
<P>You do whatever you need to do to be a good . . . no, to be a great Bank Commissioner and don't worry about the political consequences.  It doesn't matter who is involved.  I'll take the political heat.  You just do whatever you need to be a great Bank Commissioner.537

<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee confirms that Governor Clinton never interfered with Jackson or the ASB in their regulation of Madison Bank.  After his discussion with Governor Clinton, Jackson and the ASB joined with the FDIC in a cease-and-desist order against Madison Bank that curtailed the bank's ability to make out-of-territory loans and, among other things, required the bank to increase its operating capital.538  Governor Clinton never attempted to intercede on James McDougal's behalf.  In fact, other than the one conversation described above -- which was initiated by Jackson -- Governor Clinton never discussed Madison Bank or James McDougal with Jackson.539

<H3>  H.  DAN LASATER AND BOND UNDERWRITING CONTRACTS INVOLVING LASATER & COMPANY</H3>

<P>Senate Resolution 120 authorized the Special Committee to investigate "the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development Finance Authority and Lasater & Company."  In addition, the Special Committee examined a bond underwriting contract between the Arkansas State Police Commission and Lasater & Company.  The Committee's inquiry focused on allegations that Lasater & Company's selection as bond underwriter for State agencies resulted from improper political pressure.
<P>The evidence obtained by the Committee showed that the Lasater firm began participating in bond underwritings in 1983 pursuant to a State policy to expand the number of underwriters receiving State business and to include more local underwriting firms.  The firm won additional bond business through a competitive proposal process.  The Lasater firm received the same share of State bond issues as other local firms and received no special treatment.  Witnesses from the State agencies that awarded underwriting business to Lasater & Company, from Governor Clinton's office, and from the Lasater firm uniformly testified that no political pressure was applied to include Lasater & Company in State bond underwritings.
<P>The Majority relies on circumstances separate and apart from the bond underwritings themselves to suggest impropriety in the participation of the Lasater firm.  The Majority seeks to link the Lasater firm's bond underwriting to Dan Lasater's political support of Governor Clinton, friendship with Roger Clinton, even to the use of Lasater-owned aircraft.  The Majority seeks to call bond contracts to the Lasater firm in 1983 and 1985 into question due to unrelated criminal charges that Mr. Lasater later faced personally, in 1986.  The Majority relies on the recollection of a single witness to argue that a member of Governor Clinton's staff intervened with a State agency in 1983 to ensure that the Lasater firm was included as a bond underwriter, when no other witnesses recall any intervention by the Governor's office in the selection of underwriters.  
<P>The Majority's contentions, however, cannot alter the facts developed by the Committee regarding the bond underwritings themselves.  All Arkansas underwriting firms participated in State business regardless of their political identification; notably, the Stephens firm continued to receive State bond underwriting business under Governor Clinton despite opposing him politically.  All local underwriting firms participated equally, sharing the portion of the bond issues that was not allocated to one of several large national underwriters.  The Lasater firm received only a small share of State bond underwriting business, and received a similar share as other local firms.  The participation of the Lasater firm was supported by both Democratic and Republican State officials.  The allegation that Lasater & Company's participation in State bond issues was due to political favoritism is not supported by the evidence.
<P> 1.  Background
<P><P>a.  Dan Lasater
<P>Although he received no formal education past high school, Lasater was a well-known figure in Arkansas and a successful entrepreneur.540  In the 1960s, while still in his twenties, Lasater founded the Ponderosa Steak House chain.541  In 1972, before turning 30, Lasater sold his interest in Ponderosa for approximately $20 million.542  He continued to invest in restaurant chains until 1985 when he liquidated his interests.543
<P>Following the sale of his interest in Ponderosa, Lasater turned his attention to horse breeding and racing.544  He operated thoroughbred racehorse farms in Kentucky and Florida, which were very successful.545  Lasater also invested in a ski resort in New Mexico known as Angel Fire.546
<P>In the fall of 1986, Lasater was indicted on Federal charges of cocaine distribution; he pleaded guilty and served time in prison.547  Lasater is currently involved in real estate development, management of commercial real estate, timber and saw mills.548
<P><P>b.  Lasater & Company
<P>During the 1970s, Lasater became acquainted with George Locke, a former Arkansas state senator, through their mutual interest in thoroughbred racing.549  Through Locke, Lasater met securities salesman David Collins.550  In 1980 or 1981, the three men each put up approximately $70,000 and founded a securities firm called Collins, Locke & Lasater551
<P>Initially, Collins, Locke & Lasater primarily traded Government securities (issued by the U.S. Treasury and Federal agencies) and municipal securities (issued by State and local governments).552   However, in late 1982 or early 1983, Collins hired Michael Drake, an investment banker with expertise in municipal securities, to build the firm's capability to underwrite securities as well as buy and sell securities.553  In June or July, 1983, Collins withdrew from the firm and the firm's name was changed to Lasater & Company.
<P><P>c.  The Arkansas Housing Development Agency and The Arkansas
<P><P><P>Development Finance Authority

<P>The Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") was created during the administration of Governor David Pryor to promote economic activity in Arkansas and to help citizens of moderate means purchase their own homes.  AHDA raised money by issuing bonds backed by residential mortgages, then loaned that money to Arkansas institutions, which in turn used the funds to provide home mortgages to Arkansas residents.  AHDA was run by an Executive Director, who reported to a Board appointed by the Governor.  AHDA was similar in structure and purpose to housing development agencies in other States.
<P>In April 1985, as part of Governor Clinton's economic development package, AHDA was transformed into the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA"), in an effort to make low-cost funding available to promote a wider range of economic development purposes.  ADFA issued bonds in connection with a wider range of activities than AHDA, including industrial development, public infrastructure, and education.  ADFA was run by a President, again reporting to a Board appointed by the Governor.  (Some AHDA Board members continued to serve on the ADFA Board after 1985.)  ADFA was similar in structure and purpose to economic development agencies in other States.
<P><P>d.  The Arkansas State Police Commission
<P>The Arkansas State Police Commission is comprised of seven members appointed by the Governor.  The Police Commission generally supervises the State Police.  It approves significant administrative decisions, including budget and personnel matters, but does not participate in or receive information concerning police activities such as investigations.  In 1985, the Arkansas State Legislature passed legislation authorizing the State Police to acquire a new police radio system and to issue bonds to pay for the system.  The Police Commission coordinated the selection of the new communications system.  The Commission also coordinated the selection of a financing proposal and a team of underwriters to implement that proposal.
<P> 2.  Clinton Administration Policy Favored Participation by Arkansas Firms in State Bond Underwriting

<P>Under Governor Clinton, the number of firms doing underwriting business with the State of Arkansas expanded.554  From 1980-82, under Republican Governor Frank White, Arkansas State bond underwriting business had been the preserve of a small number of firms.  During that time, AHDA used underwriters E.F. Hutton, Stephens, Inc. and T.J. Raney almost exclusively.555  Those three firms underwrote four of AHDA's five issues of single family bonds prior to 1983, and shared the fifth issue with Merrill Lynch.556  The owners of Stephens, Inc. were known as political supporters of Governor White.557 
<P>After 1983, the Clinton Administration promoted participation in State bond underwriting by all qualified Arkansas firms, regardless of which political candidates they supported.558  Betsey Wright, former Chief of Staff to Governor Clinton, testified that the Clinton Administration policy was to open the State bond underwriting business to more firms.559  Sam Bratton of Governor Clinton's staff added that in the fall of 1983, Governor Clinton's goal was to make the State bond underwriting business "as open and available to all companies in the State as possible."560 
<P>Linda Chandler -- who served as AHDA's director in 1983 -- testified that AHDA Board members also favored opening AHDA bond underwriting to a greater number of firms.561  Chandler testified that expanding the number of AHDA bond underwriters benefitted the State by causing the firms to submit more competitive proposals.  
<P>We'd had the same local underwriters for three years and the same elite underwriter for four years.  If underwriters know that they are going to get the next bond issue that we decide to sell, then how competitive are they going to be?  So if you include other underwriting firms, you get lower bids.562
<P>
This, in turn, allowed AHDA to devote more of the money raised to its mission of providing affordable housing.
<P>AHDA Board Member Mort Hardwicke testified that he proposed that AHDA use a larger number of local underwriting firms, and that no one from the Governor's office asked him to do so:
<P>I just thought that the more money you could keep at home the better off you were.  And somebody explained to me that you just about had to have a national underwriter to get other bond people to participate.  So -- but that's the reason I made it, is to -- not to help Raney or Stephens or anybody else, just more or less to cut the pie into equal parts.563
<P>
Hardwicke believed that it would benefit AHDA and the State of Arkansas for more local underwriters to participate in AHDA bond issues.564  AHDA Board Member George Wright agreed that it made sense for AHDA to include more local underwriters.565  He recalled that "several [AHDA] board members" expressed the view that the agency should use more local underwriters, so long as doing so did not increase the cost of issuing securities.566
   <P>In keeping with the views of Governor Clinton and the AHDA Board Members', the agency used a greater number of underwriters after 1983.  In 1981-82, AHDA used just 4 underwriters:  E.F. Hutton, Stephens, Inc., T.J. Raney & Sons, and George K. Baum & Company  In 1983-84, AHDA used twelve underwriters, including local firms Stephens, Inc., George K. Baum & Company, T.J. Raney & Sons, Simmons First National Bank, and Lasater & Co.567  <P>Pursuant to these policies, Collins, Locke & Lasater began underwriting AHDA single family bonds in 1983.  On February 17, 1983, AHDA selected the following underwriters for the agency's single family bonds: Paine Webber and George K. Baum (sharing 60%) and T.J. Raney, Stephens, Inc. and Collins, Locke & Lasater (sharing 40% -- 13 1/3% each).  The Lasater firm thus received a share smaller than one local firm (George K. Baum) and equal to the share of two other local firms (T.J. Raney and Stephens, Inc.).  No participating firm received a smaller share than Lasater.  Two of the three AHDA Subcommittee Members who voted to include Collins, Locke & Lasater were appointed by Governor Frank White (Charles Stout and Fred Dacus).  The third, Mort Hardwicke, was appointed by Governor Bill Clinton.  Stout did not recall these events.568
<P>Collins, Locke & Lasater received an even smaller share of AHDA's next bond offering.  Minutes of an August 31, 1983 AHDA Special Board Meeting state that the Subcommittee selected the following underwriters for a $125 million offering of single family bonds: Paine Webber (25%), First Boston (20%), Prudential-Bache (15%), and George K. Baum, T.J. Raney, Stephens Inc. and Collins, Locke & Lasater (10% each).  All the local firms, including the Lasater firm, received the same share of the bond issue -- 10%.
<P>The Lasater firm also participated in offerings of AHDA multifamily bonds.  At the April 12, 1983 AHDA Board meeting, Hardwicke proposed that Merrill Lynch, Stephens Inc. and T.J. Raney form the underwriting team for multifamily bond issues.  At the April 19, 1983 meeting, George Wright moved to add Collins, Locke & Lasater to the multifamily bond underwriting team.  Neither Hardwicke nor Wright recalled these events.569
<P>Linda Chandler, AHDA's Executive Director at the time, recalled that Charles Crow from Stephens, Inc. visited her after Collins, Locke & Lasater was added as an underwriter.  He asked her to convince the AHDA Board to remove Collins, Locke & Lasater from the issue or Stephens, Inc. would resign.  He indicated Stephens, Inc. did not want Collins, Locke & Lasater included because they were "a little unscrupulous."570  Stephens may have had self-interested motivations.  According to Chandler, the inclusion of Collins, Locke & Lasater decreased Stephens, Inc.'s allocation of bonds in the issue, and thereby decreased the amount of money Stephens, Inc. might make.571
<P>Chandler relayed Crow's concerns to Charles Stout, then Chairman of the AHDA Board.  Stout told Chandler that he would handle the matter.  Chandler does not know what actions Stout took, if any.572  She considered it inappropriate for Stephens, Inc. to try to convince a State agency to fire another underwriter.573  She is not aware of other firms taking similar action.574
<P>Stephens, Inc. subsequently resigned from this bond issue and was replaced by another local firm, the Dabbs Sullivan Division of George K. Baum & Company.  In an April 28, 1983 letter, Stephens, Inc. complained that, "subsequent to our selection, the Board decided, without discussion, to add to the underwriting group a firm which did not submit a proposal under the Agency proposal procedures which invited individual firm proposals."  According to Chandler, the letter is inaccurate; no underwriters were hired without submitting proposals.575  Nor did Chandler did see any "erosion of the independence of the Board," as alleged in Stephens, Inc.'s letter.576  Furthermore, Stephens, Inc. continued to participate with the Lasater firm in other bond issues after that time.
<P> 3.  Lasater & Company Received No Special Treatment In Connection with
<P><P> AHDA/ADFA Bond Underwriting Contracts

<P>The evidence demonstrates that the Lasater firm was treated the same as other local firms.  Other local firms underwrote as many state bonds as did the Lasater firm.  The Lasater firm never served as the sole underwriter of an AHDA/ADFA bond issue; it always was part of a team of underwriters, including other local firms.  Moreover, although Lasater & Company sought to become a lead underwriter of an AHDA/ADFA bond issue -- which would have allowed the firm to make more money from the offering -- the firm never was selected to serve as a lead underwriter for the agency.577  
<P>The evidence further demonstrates that the firm did not exercise unusual influence over the agency.  For example, when Michael Drake of Lasater & Company asked ADFA to replace PaineWebber with E.F. Hutton as lead underwriter of a particular bond issue -- presumably because Lasater & Company had a better working relationship with E.F. Hutton -- the agency ignored the requests and proceeded with PaineWebber.578
<P>Lasater believed that his firm was entitled to a larger share of the AHDA bond underwritings based on its size:  
<P>It is my position that we had the second largest capitalized firm in the State of Arkansas and we didn't receive the pro rata share of the bond business that I thought we were entitled to because of the size.579
<P>
However, when Lasater lobbied Governor Clinton for a larger share of AHDA bond underwritings, Governor Clinton refused to get involved.  Lasater explained:
<P>[O]n the one occasion when I complained to Governor Clinton that Lasater & Company was not receiving its fair share of state bond underwriting business, he simply told me that we should present our case to the appropriate staff if we felt we were not being treated fairly.  He did not take any action on our behalf.  And, our position among the firms that were underwriting state bond business never improved.580
<P>
This directly contradicts the allegation that Governor Clinton sought special treatment for Lasater and Company.
<P>In sum, Lasater & Company qualified for inclusion in ADFA underwriting teams pursuant to ADFA policies.  As described by Epes:
<P>We would usually select co-managers based on two criteria.  One would be whether they had a presence in the state because we wanted to get a good effort to sell bonds within the state as well as out of the state, and get an understanding of what types of bonds needed to be -- how they needed to be structured so we could sell some in the state.

<P>And then we would usually bring in additional national firms to help us with either bond distribution, or maybe we thought that they had -- ran a close second in their proposal and had some expertise to offer. ...581 

<P>[T]here were a lot more firms there than there are now.  And many were what we refer to as bucket shops that didn't have very good reputations and they were strictly sales-oriented, didn't have underwriters that would structure bond issues.  And so we limited our involvement to firms that actually had underwriters assigned or that were employed at the firm.  And that's the main limiting factors -- those two things, coverage for sales and also having an underwriter.582
<P>
Epes testified that the Lasater firm met these criteria; it was a local firm with an underwriting capability.  He added that Lasater & Company deserved to be treated the same as other local underwriting firms, based on the firm's performance as an underwriter.
<P>My recollection is that they performed as well or better than the other local firms.  They -- I was told by the senior manager on more than one occasion that they sold more bonds than most of the other local firms.  In some cases, they sold more than any of the other locals and others they were among the top two.583

<P>Moreover, there was no guarantee that Lasater & Company would profit from its participation in the AHDA/ADFA bond underwritings.  On the contrary, the Lasater firm was at risk on the AHDA/ADFA bonds it underwrote: it bought the bonds from the agency and in turn had to find investors to purchase the bonds.  The Lasater firm received fees from the State in connection with these underwritings, but most of the firm's profits depended on its ability to find investors to purchase the bonds.  Drake testified that "the majority of the income to the firm was derived from sales commissions."584
<P>Among Collins, Locke & Lasater's brokerage clients were a group of insurance companies that were placed in receivership by the Arkansas Insurance Commissioner in 1983.  The companies were Mount Hood Pension Company, National Investors Life Insurance Company, and National Investors Pension Insurance Company  The Lasater firm approached the Insurance Commissioner, Linda Garner, about serving as a manager of companies' portfolio in receivership.  Garner believed that the assignment required a firm of greater size and experience and appointed First Boston and Stephens, Inc. as portfolio managers.  At some point, Governor Clinton called Garner to express his concern that, should the Lasater firm not be included as a manager, an Arkansas firm would be losing business.  He asked her to consider appointing E.F. Hutton to select the portfolio manager.  Garner told Governor Clinton that the assignment required an experienced national firm; she did not give E.F. Hutton or Collins, Locke & Lasater a role in managing the portfolio.  Ms. Garner testified that Governor Clinton did not pressure her to hire the Lasater firm and she did not hear from his or his staff again regarding this matter.  She did not consider it inappropriate for Governor Clinton to raise the matter with her.585
<P> 4.  Neither Governor Clinton Nor His Staff Pressured AHDA/ADFA to
<P><P> Include Lasater's Firm in Bond Underwritings

<P>It has been alleged that Governor Clinton directed AHDA and ADFA to award bond underwriting business to Lasater & Company.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that neither Governor Clinton nor his staff pressured anyone to include the Lasater firm in bond underwritings.  Members of the Governor's staff have said it did not happen, members of the AHDA Board have said it did not happen, members of the AHDA staff have said it did not happen, and employees of both Lasater & Company and a competitor have said it did not happen.  One witness recalled that a member of the staff of the Governor's Office suggested that the Lasater firm be included as an AHDA underwriter; no other witness could recall the incident. 
<P>Linda Chandler, who became AHDA Executive Director early in 1983, testified that Governor Clinton did not ask her to include or exclude any underwriting firms with respect to AHDA bond issues.  Chandler testified that when she was seeking to become AHDA Executive Director, she initiated a meeting with Governor Clinton, whom she had not previously met.  Chandler explained that she sought this meeting not to convince Governor Clinton to hire her, as that was a decision that would be made by the AHDA Board, but because she felt that under Governor Frank White the Executive Director had been a "political" position.586
<P>Chandler told Governor Clinton that she was "not political" -- she had served on the AHDA staff during both his first term and that of Governor White.  She stressed her technical expertise and told Governor Clinton she would run the agency in a "business like fashion."587  Governor Clinton made no mention of underwriting firms.588  He neither favored nor disfavored particular firms.589
<P>Chandler was selected as AHDA Executive Director.  She was not aware of any influence exerted by the Governor's office to choose an underwriter.590
<P>AHDA Board member Mort Hardwicke never discussed bond underwriting with Governor Clinton or Governor Clinton's staff.  He has never heard that the Governor's office identified a specific firm that they wanted to receive underwriting business.591  Hardwicke testified that he "never heard" of the Governor's office trying to influence AHDA's selection of underwriters.592
<P>AHDA Board Member George Wright went even further.  Wright testified that he never spoke with Governor Clinton about AHDA business.593  Moreover, no one from the Governor's office called him regarding selection of underwriters.594  Nor did anyone from the Governor's office ever contact AHDA staff members regarding underwriter selection.595
<P>Wooten Epes succeeded Linda Chandler as Executive Director of AHDA in the fall of 1983.  He testified that he did not recall ever being asked by the Governor's staff to include particular firms in bond offerings.596  Epes did not recall the Governor's office being involved with choosing underwriters.597
<P>Bob Snider and Paul Young, investment bankers at T.J. Raney & Sons, a competitor of Lasater & Company, do not recall AHDA bond contracts awarded on terms other than merit or complaints to that effect.598
<P>Just one witness recalled discussing the inclusion of a specific underwriting firm with Governor Clinton's office.  Charles Stout, an appointee of Republican Governor Frank White who was serving out his term as Chairman of the AHDA Board in 1983, recalled receiving a telephone call from Bob Nash, an assistant to Governor Clinton for economic development matters.  According to Stout, Nash "called [him] and recommended that we [AHDA] start using the Lasater firm."599  Stout testified that Nash "was suggesting a certain underwriter that we start using."600  According to Stout, Nash indicated that the Lasater firm should be allocated 15 percent of the agency's bond underwritings.601
<P>Stout recalled that, while he was on the telephone with Nash, he "asked one Board member, I think it was Hardwicke, to get on and listen to the conversation."602  Stout recalled discussing the conversation with Hardwicke after Nash hung up; he recalled that he did not speak with the other Board members but that Hardwicke informed the other Board members of the conversation:
<P>I thought that Mort [Hardwicke] talked to the other Board members.  I don't know.  It's been a long time ago, and I've had a stroke and my memory's not good.603

<P>Senator Sarbanes. ... Did you tell other members of the Board about it?

<P>Mr. Stout.  No, sir.

<P>Senator Sarbanes.  You didn't tell any of the other members?

<P>Mr. Stout.  Not to my memory, I didn't.

<P>Senator Sarbanes.  Is it your testimony that Mr. Hardwicke went around and told all the other members?

<P>Mr. Stout.  It's my recollection that he did.604

<P> Hardwicke, however, would not confirm Stout's testimony.  On the contrary, Hardwicke stated that he did not recall the incident described by Stout, despite Stout's testimony that Hardwicke joined him on the telephone with Nash.605
<P>I don't recall.  I don't doubt Mr. Stout's word but I do not recall listening to Mr. Nash telling the Board that Lasater should get 15 percent.606
<P>
Hardwicke also did not recall telling the other Board members of this call.607  Significantly, no other Board members recalled hearing about this alleged conversation.  Wright, for example, did not recall learning of this telephone call from Hardwicke:  "I don't recall hearing that Bob Nash called over here and said do this."608  He added, "Specifically, no, sir.  I don't recall him coming and talking to me about it."609 Nor did any other witness recall this conversation.  
<P>Nash testified that while he may have spoken with Stout regarding bond underwriting contracts, he never instructed Stout to include Collins, Locke & Lasater in AHDA bond issues.610  Nash did not recall ever discussing with Stout the specific percentages of bonds that different underwriting firms would receive.611  Wright testified further that neither Nash nor anyone else in the Governor's office called him to ask that the Lasater firm be added.612
<P>Even if this telephone conversation occurred -- which is hardly clear -- it is likely that other witnesses do not recall it because it was innocuous in nature.  Stout himself characterized the conversation as a suggestion from Nash, rather than a directive.613  He testified, "I took it as a suggestion."614  Nash did not threaten Stout; nor did he mention Governor Clinton's name.615  Asked what would have happened if the AHDA Board had not included the Lasater firm, Stout replied, "Who knows.  I don't think anything would have happened."616  The allegation that Governor Clinton influenced the selection of AHDA/ADFA bond underwriters based on political or personal considerations was further undermined by the Governor's treatment of his political opponents.  Stephens Inc. continued to participate in AHDA bond underwritings after Bill Clinton defeated Frank White in 1982, despite the fact that the firm had supported Frank White, and that White went to work at Stephens Inc. after losing the 1982 election.617  Hardwicke recalled that he spoke with Governor Clinton shortly after he was reelected in 1982 and asked him how to deal with Stephens, Inc.  According to Hardwicke, the Governor replied: "Give them a fair shake.  That was the end of the conversation."618

<P>Finally, Lasater himself testified that he did not believe the awarding of State bond business was related to political considerations:
<P>I believe that Lasater & Company would have received the same amount of bond business if they did or did not contribute to the Clinton campaign.  And I base that on the fact that Stephens, Inc. who did the majority of the business when Frank White was Governor contributed heavily to Frank White, supported Frank White and fought the election of Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton still gave them a large share of the State business.619

<P> 5.  Lasater Had No Influence Over AHDA/ADFA Appointments

<P>The documents produced to the Special Committee include several letters to Governor Clinton from Lasater and his associates, recommending various individuals be appointed to the AHDA and ADFA boards.  It has been alleged that these letters show that Lasater exerted undue influence over the agency.  The evidence does not support this allegation.  As an initial matter, there is nothing inherently improper about a citizen recommending possible appointees to State boards; the evidence developed by the Committee indicates it happened regularly.  
<P>Moreover, there was nothing unique about Lasater's recommendations; on the contrary many of the individuals recommended by Lasater were not appointed by Governor Clinton.  For example, on January 4, 1985, Lasater wrote to Governor Clinton recommending Don Spears for the AHDA Board.620   Spears, however, was not appointed.621  Similarly, on April 3, 1985, Patsy Thomasson wrote to Governor Clinton recommending Don Spears, Ed Willis and Jim Tom Bell for ADFA Board.622  Thomasson received a form letter back from Governor Clinton.623  Neither Willis nor Bell was appointed to the ADFA Board.624
<P>Nor can Lasater & Company's recommendations reasonably be characterized as attempts to influence the bond underwriter selection process.  For example, on March 31, 1983, David Collins wrote to Governor Clinton recommending Linda Trent [Chandler] for AHDA Executive Director.625  Chandler has never met David Collins and was not aware he had written a letter of recommendation on her behalf.626  She has never met Dan Lasater either.627
<P>Similarly, on May 1, 1985 Lasater wrote three identical letters to Governor Clinton, recommending that Bill Mathis be appointed to the ADFA Board and that Mort Hardwicke and George Wright be reappointed to the ADFA Board.628  Lasater received three identical form letters back from Governor Clinton.629  Mathis was not appointed to the ADFA Board while Hardwicke and Wright were reappointed.630   Hardwicke testified that he has never met Lasater and was not aware of the letter.631  Wright testified he also has never met Lasater and "was unaware that Lasater ever recommended me for anything."632
<P>Finally, the evidence showed that Dan Lasater and his colleagues at Lasater & Company were hardly the only source of unsolicited recommendations to the Governor's office regarding appointments to the ADFA Board.  Governor Clinton regularly received recommendations other private individuals, as well as public officials, such as members of the State legislature.633  In this regard, Drake testified that when he worked at Stephens, Inc., that firm "routinely" made recommendations to the Governor's office regarding appointments to state boards.634

<P> 6.  The Raney/Hutton/Lasater Team Was Awarded the State Police
<P><P> Commission Bond Underwriting Contract on the Merits

<P>The Committee also examined a 1985 bond issue for the Arkansas State Police shared by T.J. Raney & Sons, E.F. Hutton and Lasater & Co.  It has been alleged that Governor Clinton influenced the underwriter selection process to benefit Lasater.  The record, however, is at odds with this allegation.  It shows that Governor Clinton and his staff did not pressure the Arkansas State Police to include the Lasater firm in the bond underwriting or to award the contract to the group including the Lasater firm.  To the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that Governor Clinton and his staff played no part in the underwriter selection process.
<P><P>a.  Background
<P>The 1984 murder of an Arkansas State Trooper while outside the range of the Arkansas State Police radio system attracted widespread press attention in Arkansas.635 The murder highlighted the inefficiency of the existing radio system and gave new urgency to the State Police's longstanding efforts to replace the system.  Traveling together to that Trooper's funeral, the director of the Arkansas State Police, Col. Tommy Goodwin lobbied Governor Clinton for a new police radio system.636  Governor Clinton agreed that a new radio system was necessary.  As such, the State Police were evaluating financing alternatives for a new  communications system by October 1, 1984.637

<P><P>b.  The Formation of the Raney, Hutton, Lasater Group

<P>It was well-known to underwriting firms in Arkansas that a financing opportunity would exist with respect to a new police radio system.  Bob Snider, head of the public finance department at T.J. Raney, testified that his firm learned of this opportunity in late 1984, before the State Police officially solicited proposals from financial firms.638   Paul Young of T.J. Raney discussed the transaction with Bobby Roberts, Governor Clinton's liaison for criminal justice matters. 639  Young and Snider also met with Sam Bratton, Governor Clinton's Counsel.640  Neither Roberts nor Bratton expressed a preference for any underwriting firm or indicated that Lasater & Company should receive this business.641  No one in the Governor's office suggested any other financial firms with which T.J. Raney should work on this project.642
<P>As part of its efforts to prepare for the underwriter selection, T.J. Raney contacted Stephens, Inc. about joining forces to pursue the financing.  Snider testified:
<P>Our first call was to Stephens.  They turned us down.  They wanted to go by themselves on this [the police radio transaction].  Our next call was to E.F. Hutton.643 
<P>
Snider recalled that E.F. Hutton suggested that Lasater & Company be included in the transaction: "when I talked to Hutton about us going joint account, Hutton mentioned to me that they felt like Lasater should be involved."644

<P>The evidence indicates that the Raney firm approached the Lasater firm to work together on the police radio bonds.  Drake testified that Young and Snider of T.J. Raney contacted him regarding joining forces to underwrite bonds for the State Police Commission:
<P>It's my recollection that in mid-1984 -- and it may have in the spring or in the summer -- I was approached by two gentlemen from T.J. Raney and Sons, Bob Snider, who is managing director of the public finance department, and a colleague of his, Paul Young...seeking our assistance in pursuing the creation of legislation that would enable a state police radio system to be acquired by the Arkansas State Police, one to structuring a transaction that would enable us to underwrite the securities; and, [sic] three, to participate in a transaction that involved E.F. Hutton as the national distributor of securities.645

Young believed that Snider initiated contact with the Lasater firm.646  Snider did not recall whether he, Young or someone from E.F. Hutton contacted the Lasater firm. 647 
<P>The witnesses disagreed as to why the Raney firm approached the Lasater firm.  Young testified that T.J. Raney contacted Lasater & Company because of Lasater & Company's experience underwriting AHDA bonds.648  Drake, however, recalled that the Raney firm wanted to work with Lasater & Company because of Lasater's relationship with Governor Clinton, and that he told this to Lasater.649  Neither Lasater, Young nor Snider recalled discussing with Drake that T.J. Raney approached Lasater & Company regarding the Police Commission bond underwriting because of Lasater's relationship with Governor Clinton.650  Young, in fact, testified that he did not tell Drake that T.J. Raney approached Lasater & Company because of Lasater's relationship with Governor Clinton.651  Snider also testified that was not the case:
<P>Q.<P>Did anyone from T.J. Raney & Sons approach Mr. Drake, to your knowledge, and indicate that the reason they were approaching Lasater & Company was because of their relationship with the Governor?

<P>A.<P>No.  That's not why we did it.652

<P>In any case, the fact that T.J. Raney first approached Stephens, Inc., and only approached Lasater & Company after Stephens, Inc. declined to enter into a partnership, undermines the allegation that T.J. Raney was seeking political connections to the Clinton Administration; as discussed earlier, the Stephens firm had been a political opponent of Governor Clinton.
<P>   
<P><P> c.  The Awarding of the Underwriting Contract
<P>On April 4, 1985, Governor Clinton signed Act 817, "An Act Authorizing the Leasing of Communications Equipment for the Department of the Arkansas State Police; Providing for the Payment and Security of the Costs of the Equipment; and for Other Purposes."653  The Act authorized the State Police Commission to acquire a new communications system, financed by bonds that in turn would be financed by revenues from drivers' license fees. 
<P>Much has been made of the fact that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group hired the Mitchell, Williams law firm to help draft the legislation.  The Majority alleges that the group benefitted improperly from the role their attorneys played in drafting the statute.  In fact, the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group enjoyed no special advantages or information as a result of having retained the Mitchell, Williams firm.654  The legislation did not specify what financial firms would underwrite bonds, did not establish criteria for such firms, and did not even specify by what procedures the State Police would select underwriters.655 Young, Colonel Goodwin and Police Commissioner Johnny Mitchum testified that the legislation did not bias the selection process in favor of the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team.656  The legislation of course had to be approved and passed by the Arkansas legislature to become a public law, after which it was available to all.  The Lasater group made no secret of its relationship with the Mitchell, Williams firm.  Sam Bratton, former Counsel to Governor Clinton, testified that it was common for law firms with expertise in bond work to draft bond-related legislation.657 
<P>On the same day Governor Clinton signed the legislation, the State Police Commission began a competitive process to select the bond underwriters.  The State Police solicited proposals from all interested financial firms.  In this regard, the minutes of an April 4, 1985 Meeting of the State Police Commission state:
<P>After a lengthy discussion between members of the Commission, Mr. Ed Erxleben and Mr. Dudley Meadows of State Purchasing, and representatives of several financial firms concerning procedures to follow relating to the acquisition and financing of the communication equipment, the Commission agreed to begin immediately the process of selecting a financial institution to handle the financing.

<P>The Commission agreed to solicit proposals from only those companies doing  business in Arkansas.

<P>A letter will be mailed on Monday, April 8, 1985 to financial institutions in the state seeking proposals, with a cut-off date of two weeks from date of letter for proposals to be received.658

<P>The State Police received eight proposals in response to its letter request.  The eight proposals were then winnowed to four finalists by a Committee consisting entirely of career government officials: three State Police staff members (State Police Director Col. Tommy Goodwin, State Police Deputy Director Maj. Jim Tyler, and State Police Purchasing Officer David Mosely) and two staff from the State Purchasing Department (Ed Erxleben and Dudley Meadows).659
<P>Police Commissioner Johnny Mitchum, an appointee of Governor Frank White, was a certified public accountant and the only member of the Police Commission with a background in finance. 660  Mitchum reviewed the underwriting proposals and concluded that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal was the most attractive for the State.661 In order to obtain some independent corroboration, Mitchum hired an actuary, John Myers, to evaluate the four proposals selected as finalists.662  Mitchum did not know Myers, and had no reason to believe Myers would favor one firm over another.663  While Myers recalled that Mitchum told him that he considered the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal to be the most favorable, Mitchum did not recall indicating that.664  In any event, Myers and Mitchum agree that Mitchum did not direct Myers to reach any particular conclusion.665
<P>The evaluation prepared by Myers assigned a net present value of $18,101,700 to the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal.  In other words, Myers calculated that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal would cost the State slightly more than $18 million (in 1985 dollars) over the life of the bonds.  This was less than the net present value that Myers calculated for the Stephens, Inc. and Dabbs Sullivan proposals, but $28,000 more than the $18,073,030 assigned to the First Capital proposal.666  Myers testified that, given the size of the transaction, the $28,000 difference was de minimus and the Raney/Hutton/Lasater and First Capital bids were statistically equivalent.667  Myers concurred at the time that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater bid was the best for the State of Arkansas.668
<P>There is no evidence that any of the losing bidders challenged Myers' analysis.  However, the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group did raise some concern.  In particular, Young testified that Myers did not adequately reflect the benefit to the State of the debt service reserve in the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal and therefore overstated the net present value of the proposal.669
<P>Actually, I did not feel like it gave us the advantage that I thought that we had.  I had reviewed all the proposals myself and had looked at this particular proposal, and I don't think I really felt like it was as close as he presented.  We had in our structure some funds that were invested that would generate a benefit that frankly I thought [was] not adequately weighed in his analysis.670
<P>
In essence, the larger debt service reserve contained in the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal allowed the State to lower its overall cost of borrowing through arbitrage.671  Young testified that:  
<P>the Stephens proposal had a reserve amount equal to one half-year's debt service as opposed to ours which had a full year's debt service, which actually was detrimental to their presentation because at the time...an issuer could keep the benefit of earnings that were generated over and above what the financing rate was.  So the larger the reserve the greater the net benefit to an issuer.  I don't recall how the other presentation structured their reserves.  I think some had full year reserves.  I think the one prepared by First Capital, I think, didn't have any reserve.672

<P>On May 10, 1995, the Police Commission heard oral presentations from the four finalists.673  After all the presentations, Commissioner Johnny Mitchum moved that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team be awarded the contract.  This motion carried by a vote of 4 to 2.674

<P><P>d. Legislative Review of the Underwriting Contract

<P>Act 817, the enabling legislation for the police radio system, stated

<P>The [Police] Commission shall submit any contract, agreement, or proposal, as authorized by this Act, to the Arkansas Communications Study Committee and to the Arkansas Legislative Council prior to any obligation being incurred by the Commission for their advice and counsel.675
<P>
Both the Communications Study Committee and the Legislative Council ultimately gave favorable advice to the proposal.  The Minutes of the July 10, 1985 Meeting of the Communications Study Committee, at which the contract was approved, state, "Mr. Erxleben said it was a well coordinated and reviewed contract."676  Erxleben had been appointed State Purchasing Director by Governor Frank White and retained by Governor Clinton.677
<P><P>e.  The Clinton Administration properly investigated rumors that Lasater was under
<P><P>investigation for Drug use and was advised that no investigation was underway

<P>The Majority argues that it was improper for the State Police Commission to award this contract to a group including Lasater & Company because of rumors at the time that Lasater used cocaine.  In fact, it is clear that the Clinton Administration was concerned about awarding State bond business to anyone under investigation for drug offenses.  The Governor and members of his staff raised the issue with law enforcement authorities, who reported that no investigations of Lasater were underway.
<P>In early 1985, Hot Springs lawyer Sam Anderson, Jr. was tried on cocaine distribution and conspiracy charges.  A witness at that trial testified that Lasater used cocaine.678  Col. Tommy Goodwin, who had been appointed by Governor Frank White as Director of the Arkansas State Police, testified that before Lasater & Company was awarded the State Police bond underwriting, Governor Clinton told him that the firm should not get the contract if Lasater was under investigation for cocaine distribution.679  Col. Goodwin asked subordinates in the State Police to make inquiries.  They determined that no State or local criminal investigations of Lasater were underway at that time.680  Although the Arkansas State Police began an investigation of Lasater the following year, the Police had no investigation underway in 1985.681
<P>Betsey Wright, then Governor Clinton's Chief of Staff, also asked Colonel Goodwin to check if any investigations were underway.  She, too, was advised that no investigations were underway.682
<P>Lasater testified that he first became aware that he was the target of a cocaine investigation no more than sixty days before he was indicted on Federal charges in October 1986.683


<P> 7.  Neither Governor Clinton Nor His Staff Pressured the Arkansas State
<P><P> Police to Award Bond Underwriting Contracts to Lasater's Firm

<P>The Majority asserts that the Governor's Office closely monitored the bond underwriting process, and suggests that this tainted the process.  However, even assuming that the Governor's office did keep track of the contracting process, there is no evidence that Governor Clinton or anyone acting on his behalf sought to influence the selection of an underwriter.  On the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that the Police Commission selected the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group on its own, without any influence from the Governor's office.
<P>As an initial matter, the Governor's staff testified that no influence was exerted.  Betsey Wright, Governor Clinton's Chief of Staff, testified that the Governor's office did not express any preference to the State Police that Lasater & Company be awarded the underwriting contract and played no role in the selection process.684   Sam Bratton, Governor Clinton's Counsel, testified that Lasater did not receive any kind of special treatment with respect to the police bond contract.685  Michael Gaines, the Governor's liaison with the Police Commission, gave similar testimony.686
<P>Second, Lasater and his employees testified that no influence was exerted on his behalf.  Lasater testified he does not recall discussing the State Police Commission bond underwriting with Governor Clinton or his staff.687   He is not aware of political pressure brought to bear on the award of this contract.  Drake testified that he is not aware of anyone at Lasater & Company discussing the State Police underwriting contract with Governor Clinton, or of anyone from the Governor's office taking steps to award the contract to the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team.688  Young testified that in his discussions with Governor Clinton's staff, he was never told that Lasater & Company would receive this award.689  On the contrary, Young was concerned that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group might not receive the contract despite submitting the best proposal.690
<P>Finally, the State Police witnesses themselves testified that they acted unilaterally and without influence from the Governor's office. Commissioner Mitchum testified that:  "I never recall anyone from the Governor's office taking an active role in that process."691  Nor did Governor Clinton's office suggest that he undertake any kind of comparison that would favor the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal.692  Colonel Goodwin, the director of the Arkansas State Police, testified that Governor Clinton never indicated to him that Dan Lasater was interested in securing this piece of bond underwriting business.693  
<P>The breakdown of the vote by the State Police Commission to award the contract to the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team demonstrates that it was not a politically motivated decision.  The vote on the contract was 4-2.  Commissioners Mitchum and Rockefeller two of the four commissioners who voted to award the contract to Raney/Hutton/Lasater, were Republican appointees to the Police Commission.  One Clinton appointee voted in favor of the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group, as did the sole appointee of Governor David Pryor.  Notably, both members who voted against the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team, Commissioners Raff and Mashburn, were Clinton appointees.694  The Director of the State Police at the time, Colonel Goodwin, also had been appointed by Republican Governor Frank White.695
<P>The Raney/Hutton/Lasater team did not enjoy any special advantages in formulating a proposal.  One losing bidder complained that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater proposal violated the enabling legislation, by providing for semiannual payments to bondholders rather than monthly payments.  (This allowed the State to earn more in interest from holding the funds.)  However, the legislation did not require that bondholders receive monthly payments; it required only that the radio equipment be paid for monthly:  "Payments to cover the costs under the Lease Agreement shall be paid from the Lease Fund on a monthly basis."696  As Young explained, this simply required the State to segregate the funds monthly, so they would be available for their designated purpose; it did not control the payments to bondholders.697  Arkansas State bonds typically paid bondholders semiannually.698  Young testified that all the other financial firms interpreted the statute in the same way as did the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team, namely providing for semiannual payments.699  Only one losing bidder interpreted it differently.700  Therefore, the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group gained little from the interpretation of the legislation by the Mitchell, Williams firm cited in the Majority Report: most bidders had already interpreted the legislation to provide for semiannual payments.
<P>It has been alleged that a May 1, 1985 memorandum that Michael Gaines, Governor Clinton's liaison to the Arkansas State Police, sent to the Governor and Betsey Wright reflected an improper attempt by the Clinton Administration to monitor the underwriter selection process.701  The memorandum indicates "Tommy Goodwin's observations" of which firms the Commissioners favored for the underwriting contract.  Gaines does not recall preparing the memorandum; he does not believe he asked Colonel Goodwin for this information but rather that Colonel Goodwin provided him this information to him. 702  No one in the Governor's office told Gaines to monitor the votes on the award of the bond underwriting contract.703  Betsey Wright testified that she was not monitoring the votes.704
<P>Betsey Wright wrote a note on the memorandum that "street talk" suggested that Lasater had submitted "an unreasonably low bid knowing he can raise it once he gets it."  In response to Wright's note, Governor Clinton wrote, "Lasater should be told bid must be price."  The majority has alleged that this colloquy showed the Clinton Administration's favoritism to Lasater.  This allegation lacks merit.  Far from demonstrating favoritism to Lasater, Governor Clinton's comment demonstrated his insistence that contracts be awarded on the merits, and the State's fiscal interest be protected.
<P>In any event, Wright's concerns were unfounded.  This underwriting contract did not entail "bid" to provide goods or services for the State at a price that could be altered later, but rather a "proposal" to sell securities to investors.  Drake explained:
<P>...in all deference to Betsey, whom I admire as a wonderful public servant, she doesn't know beans about investment banking.  She may have heard that we had "low balled."  But, there was no bid.  There was no bid to low ball.  It was a proposal. ... her concern, in my mind, was a concern of perception rather than reality.  We submitted a proposal.  We were not asked to submit a bid nor were our competitors asked to submit a bid.  Our proposal contained a provision for interest rates if the securities were sold at the moment of our submission.  And, if you will look at my memo of April 30th to Dan [Lasater], George [Locke] and Dan Moudy, which appears to be in reaction to an assertion that we had low balled our proposal, I make it real clear that the proposals ...were submitted well in advance of the financing date.705
<P>
Drake added that while the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team may have priced the securities aggressively, "aggressive pricing only occurs by definition when securities are offered, not when a proposal is made."706  Thus, the aggressive pricing did not involve the State on the State's money.
<P> 8.  Dan Lasater's Relationship with Bill Clinton and Roger Clinton

<P>Dan Lasater first met Virginia Kelley, the mother of Bill and Roger Clinton, at the Oaklawn Park racetrack in Hot Springs in the late 1970's.707  He met Roger Clinton shortly thereafter, while Roger was singing at a nightclub in Hot Springs.708  At some later point, Mrs. Kelley introduced Lasater to her other son, Governor Clinton, at Oaklawn.709
<P>While Roger Clinton was not one of his closest friends, Lasater did socialize with him during 1982-86.710  Lasater recalled that either Governor Clinton or Virginia Kelley asked Lasater if he could find a job for Roger Clinton.711  Lasater hired Roger Clinton to work as a stablehand at his Florida horse farm; he worked there for four to six months during 1983.712  Roger Clinton received the same compensation as other stablehands.713  Lasater testified that hiring Roger Clinton was not intended to help his firm get State business:
<P>Senator Faircloth.  No connection?  You didn't think that hiring the Governor's brother and having him would help you to curry favor and friendship with the governor and get bond business?

<P>Mr. Lasater.  I don't think hiring the Governor's brother for $3 an hour to muck stalls at a farm in Florida would get me any business, no.714

<P>Around 1984, Roger Clinton told Lasater than he owed a drug dealer $8000 and that the drug dealer had threatened to harm him, Governor Clinton and Virginia Kelley if the debt were not paid.715  Lasater testified that he does not know if Governor Clinton and Mrs. Kelley were aware of this threat.716  Lasater loaned the money to Roger Clinton.717  Lasater never discussed the loan with Governor Clinton and doesn't know when Governor Clinton became aware of it.718
<P>Lasater became a political supporter of Governor Clinton in the 1980's.  George Locke recalled that he was contacted by Governor Clinton or his staff within days of Governor Clinton's loss to Frank White in 1980, and introduced Lasater to the Governor at a meeting shortly thereafter.719  Lasater testified that Locke has told him that sometime during 1980-1982, while Bill Clinton was seeking to regain the office he had lost to Frank White in 1980, Clinton asked to meet with Messrs. Locke, Collins and Lasater to seek their support and that such a meeting took place.720  Lasater has no independent recollection of the meeting.721  Lasater contributed to Governor Clinton's campaigns in 1982, 1984 and 1986.  Lasater organized a fundraiser* for Governor Clinton in 1984, which raised approximately $50,000.722  
<P>Lasater described himself as "a friend and supporter [of Governor Clinton], like many people in Arkansas.  Not a close friend."723  While the Majority cited a letter Lasater sent to Governor Clinton asking for access to the Governor's office, the Majority omitted the testimony of Lasater and Betsey Wright that no such access was given.724  Lasater recalled being at the Governor's Mansion on no more than two occasions.725
<P>...I can recall being at the Governor's Mansion possibly twice, and those were social events.  I think one time was when Bob Hope was in town and they had some kind of a party over there for him, and some other social function.  I have never been to the mansion on a personal basis.726
<P>
Lasater specifically denied the tales of Barry Spivey cited by the Majority;727 Spivey was never questioned by the Committee and his account was obtained by the Majority outside the Committee's regular procedures for production of documents and is consequently unauthenticated.  Lasater was not a close friend of Governor Clinton and received no special treatment as a result of his relationship with Governor Clinton or Roger Clinton.
<P>In October 1986, Lasater was indicted on a single Federal count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and to possess with intent to distribute.  He pleaded guilty the next week and served six months in prison and a further six months in a halfway house.728  Lasater never discussed the cocaine investigation with Governor Clinton and doesn't know when Governor Clinton learned of it.729  Following his guilty plea, Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer revoked his securities license.730

<H3>  I.  THE ROSE LAW FIRM'S REPRESENTATION OF MADISON  GUARANTY</H3>

<P>From 1977 until 1992, Mrs. Clinton practiced law at the Rose Law Firm, one of the most prominent law firms in Arkansas.  Starting as an associate, within two years Mrs. Clinton became a partner in the firm.
<P>In April 1985 Madison Guaranty retained the Rose Law Firm to provide legal advice on a securities law matter, a proposed sale of preferred stock.  The following year, on July 14, 1986, the firm ceased its representation of Madison Guaranty so the firm could qualify to represent federal regulatory agencies in litigation involving failed savings and loan associations.  The Rose Law Firm was paid approximately $21,000 for its work in 1985 and 1986 on behalf of Madison Guaranty.    
<P>The Committee devoted considerable attention to the circumstances of the Rose Law Firm's retention by Madison Guaranty.  In particular, the Committee examined allegations that James McDougal directed a portion of Madison Guaranty's legal business to Mrs. Clinton for improper reasons.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that nothing improper occurred in connection with Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm.
<P>The Committee also examined the substance of the work the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton performed for Madison Guaranty.  The evidence demonstrated that the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty was legitimate, well-documented, and appropriately billed.  There is no credible evidence that any of the legal services provided by Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm were improper or contributed to the failure of the institution.
<P>Finally, the Committee reviewed Mrs. Clinton's prior statements concerning the Rose Law Firm's retention by and work for Madison Guaranty.  In this regard, the Committee carefully examined the documentary evidence, including the Rose Law Firm's billing records for the Madison Guaranty engagement, and took testimony from Rose Law Firm lawyers who participated in the representation.  The Committee also examined the documents prepared by the Rose Law Firm for Madison Guaranty.  This evidence demonstrated that Mrs. Clinton has accurately characterized her representation of Madison Guaranty as limited and insubstantial.
   <P>   1.  Retention of the Rose Law Firm by Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan

<P>On February 25, 1996, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, the law firm retained by the Resolution Trust Corporation to investigate possible civil claims relating to Madison 
Guaranty, concluded that a "finder of fact is highly unlikely to find that there was anything untoward, let alone fraudulent or intentionally wrongful, in the circumstances of the Rose Law Firm's retention by Madison Guaranty."731  The Special Committee's investigation has confirmed that conclusion.
<P> a.  Madison Guaranty's Proposal to Issue Preferred Stock
<P>The Rose Law Firm was initially retained by Madison Guaranty in April 1985 to provide legal advice on securities law matters, including a proposed offering of preferred stock.  James McDougal apparently had already developed a plan to sell preferred stock and had even lined up some potential buyers for the stock.  On April 3, 1985, Madison Guaranty personnel met with officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (the "FHLBB") in Dallas.  A contemporaneous memorandum732 of that meeting prepared by an FHLBB official states, "The Association plans to issue $600,000 of preferred stock for which a buyer is awaiting issuance, and a second issue of unknown amount will follow shortly thereafter."*  An April 18, 1985 memorandum from McDougal to Madison Guaranty president John Latham states, "I want this preferred stock matter cleared up immediately as I need to go to Washington to sell stock."733  
<P>In early April Madison Guaranty employees had taken some preliminary steps to  prepare to sell the preferred stock,734 but legal issues had arisen when they contacted the Arkansas Securities Department (the "ASD") to obtain forms for the stock offering.735  On April 3, 1985, ASD Chief Examiner Charles Handley advised Madison Guaranty vice president Davis Fitzhugh (a lawyer with an MBA degree who was working with Latham on the preferred stock matter)736 that he questioned whether Madison Guaranty could issue non-voting preferred stock, but he would "be glad to review his or the association's attorney[s'] reasons and opinions as to their ability to issue preferred stock."737  McDougal's April 18 memorandum to Latham directing that the preferred stock matter be "cleared up immediately," coupled with Handley's suggestion that an opinion from Madison Guaranty's counsel might resolve the legal issue, may have precipitated the engagement of the Rose Law Firm -- the first time entries by Rose Law Firm attorneys on the preferred stock matter are dated April 23, 1985, five days after McDougal's memorandum to Latham, and include conferences with Latham and McDougal about the proposed preferred stock offering. 
<P>There are good reasons for Latham and McDougal to have retained the Rose Law Firm to assist Madison Guaranty with the preferred stock matter.  At the time that Madison Guaranty encountered questions from the ASD on the preferred stock proposal, some of the institution's employees had been consulting with a Rose Law Firm attorney on securities law issues, although the firm had not been retained and Madison Guaranty was not being billed for those informal consultations.738   Rick Massey, then a first-year associate at the Rose Law Firm, had met John Latham when Massey lectured on securities law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law.739  Latham was one of the students in a securities law class Massey taught, and after class Latham sometimes would ask Massey questions about securities law issues.740  After a few of these discussions Latham referred another Madison employee to Massey for advice on securities law matters.741  
<P>Massey recalls that eventually he had lunch with Latham and "actually pitched the business to him [saying] . . . Why don't you hire us and put us to work on some of these things."742  Rose Law Firm partner David Knight accompanied Massey to the lunch with Latham.743  Latham recalls "that Rick pitched the business in the sense that he wanted us to hire them to do legal work for us."744   Latham's response was that he did not have the authority to do so.745  Massey testified that he may have then had a conversation with Mrs. Clinton about Madison Guaranty, because he was aware that she was acquainted with James McDougal.746   Latham also has a "vague recollection" of a discussion with McDougal in which they either discussed or Latham inferred that McDougal "had friends at the Rose Law Firm" and "was wanting to spread his business with more of his friends."747
<P> b.  Mrs. Clinton's Role in the Retention of the Rose Law Firm by Madison Guaranty
<P>Mrs. Clinton recalls that Massey or Vincent Foster asked her if she would talk to McDougal about the firm doing legal work for Madison Guaranty.748  Mrs. Clinton also recalls that some of the Rose Law Firm's partners were hesitant to accept McDougal as a client because several years earlier, when McDougal was operating another small Arkansas financial institution  -- Madison Bank & Trust Company of Kingston, Arkansas* -- he had retained the firm and then failed to pay in full for the services they provided.749  The Special Committee's investigation has confirmed Mrs. Clinton's recollection of a problem obtaining payment from Madison Bank for prior legal work by the Rose Law Firm.  Documentation obtained by the Special Committee shows that the Rose Law Firm was not paid by Madison Bank for legal work in late 1981 and early 1982 until October 1984 -- almost three years after the work was done.750  Moreover, when the Rose Law Firm finally was paid in October 1984, Madison Bank paid only $5,000 of the total $5,893.63 that was owed to the firm.751
<P>In addition, Rose Law Firm partner David Knight confirmed that at the time of the lunch with Latham, Rose Law Firm partners were concerned about the problem the firm had encountered collecting for the earlier Madison Bank work.  Knight testified that immediately before the lunch with Latham he mentioned the possible Madison Guaranty engagement to C.J. Giroir, a senior partner at the firm, who raised the problem the firm had encountered in collecting for the Madison Bank legal work.752  Knight recalls that Giroir said, "He thought it was fine to go ahead and have the lunch.  But if anything came out of it, and we decided we wanted to undertake a representation on something, that we needed to -- I needed to look into that and make sure there wasn't a problem there."753  As noted above, Mrs. Clinton recalls that Vincent Foster may have asked her to approach McDougal about the firm's retention by Madison Guaranty and the prior payment problems with McDougal at Madison Bank, and that she may have spoken with other Rose Law Firm partners about the matter.754 (Her recollection that she may have spoken with other partners is consistent with Knight's recollection that Giroir raised the matter with him -- clearly the partners were concerned about McDougal's prior failure to pay his bills in a timely fashion.) 
<P>Although it is impossible now, over eleven years later, to reconstruct exactly how the billing issue was resolved and the Rose Law Firm was retained, it appears that Massey* or Foster may have spoken with Mrs. Clinton about the billing problem and she then spoke with McDougal.755  Mrs. Clinton recalls that she told McDougal the Rose Law Firm would do the work if Madison Guaranty would enter into a retainer agreement which would ensure that the Rose Law Firm was paid for its work.756  Mrs. Clinton remembers that McDougal agreed to a $2,000 a month retainer and indicated that Massey could do the securities work for Madison, if "Latham wants him to do the work."757   
<P>Mrs. Clinton was the "billing partner" on the Madison Guaranty engagement, and Massey was the junior associate responsible for the "hands-on" legal work.  This arrangement was dictated both by the kind of legal work that was involved and by the Rose Law Firm's internal management policies.  The work to be done for Madison Guaranty involved advice on corporate securities law, a very technical and specialized area.  Mrs. Clinton was a commercial litigator and did not have any special expertise in corporate securities law.758  Massey, who did practice in that area, was a junior associate.  Rose Law Firm policies did not permit a junior associate to be solely responsible for a client account.759   Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton served as the billing partner while Massey did most of the work on the securities law matters.*
<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee confirms that Massey performed most of the substantive legal work and billed considerably more time than Mrs. Clinton on the securities law matters.760  This finding is consistent with Mrs. Clinton's public statements regarding the matter, including her statements before additional billing records were discovered in the White House on January 4, 1996.761  The Rose Law Firm billing records that were discovered in January 1996 contain detailed time entries for the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty.  Those records show that Mrs. Clinton's billings on the securities law matters totalled approximately 19.4 hours over 9 months, while Massey billed 75.4 hours over the same time period.
<P>During the Special Committee's hearings an issue arose concerning Mrs. Clinton's description of her work for Madison Guaranty as a "minimal amount."762  Comparing Mrs. Clinton's Madison Guaranty billings with the billings by Jay Stephens of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro on the investigation of Madison Guaranty conducted by that firm for the Resolution Trust Corporation sheds some light on this issue.  As discussed elsewhere in this report, Stephens testified that he did "minimal" work on the PM&S investigation of Madison Guaranty, but his billing records763 show that he billed 339.75 hours over 12 months, or an average of 28.3 hours per month.  Mrs. Clinton in contrast, billed 63.5 hours over 15 months, or an average of 4.23 hours per month.  The fact that Mr. Stephens testified under oath that his work was "minimal" in amount,764 when the records of the time he billed to the government show he did far more work in 1994 and 1995 than Mrs. Clinton did in 1985 and 1986, demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton's description of her work for Madison Guaranty as "minimal" is fair and accurate.  (The comparison also suggests that Mrs. Clinton's critics may be applying a double-standard in an effort to score political points.)       <P>
<P>Other contemporaneous documentation that the Special Committee has collected confirms the limited nature of Mrs. Clinton's work on the preferred stock and securities brokerage matters.  Massey corresponded and consulted extensively with the ASD on a number of issues relating to the preferred stock proposal and Madison Guaranty's efforts to license a securities brokerage affiliate.  The documentation indicates that the correspondence and other communications on these matters were between Handley, representing the ASD, and Massey, representing Madison Guaranty.765  Handley testified that he had numerous communications with Massey about the preferred stock and broker-dealer matters.766  He did not have any contact with Mrs. Clinton.  Mrs. Clinton's time records show that she reviewed only a few of the letters that Massey wrote to the ASD, had no discussions with Handley, and played little or no role in the drafting and the underlying research and legal analysis.767  Mrs. Clinton had only one brief telephone discussion with the ASD, which is discussed below.
<P>There is no significant discrepancy between the recollections of Massey and Mrs. Clinton regarding the circumstances surrounding the retention of the Rose Law Firm by Madison Guaranty.  Latham and Knight confirm the key events -- the effort by Massey to obtain business from Madison Guaranty768 and the prior billing problem for Madison Bank work.769  Massey has consistently stated that he made an effort to recruit Madison Guaranty as a client and had made a proposal to Latham, "As I testified earlier, I actually pitched the business to him.  I think the pitch was basically, gee, I'm -- you're asking me all these questions. Why don't you hire us and put us to work on these some of these things."770  Latham confirmed that Massey "pitched the business" at the lunch and tried to persuade Latham that Madison Guaranty should retain the Rose Law Firm.771  Massey was unable to "close the deal," however, because Latham did not have the authority to retain the Rose Law Firm.  (Latham does recall that he suggested to McDougal that Madison Guaranty should retain the Rose Law Firm, and McDougal came back to Latham and instructed him to put the Rose Law Firm on retainer.772)  Mrs. Clinton eventually played a role in resolving the matter because of her prior relationship with James McDougal.773
<P>Different versions of how Madison Guaranty retained the Rose Law Firm have been recounted by James McDougal* and over time have been discredited.  McDougal at one point told a reporter that Governor Clinton visited McDougal at Madison Guaranty and expressed a concern about his family's financial situation, then asked if McDougal could send Mrs. Clinton some of Madison Guaranty's legal work.774  The Special Committee's investigation supports the prior conclusion of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro that McDougal's story is contrary to the evidence and simply makes no sense.**  
<P>A brief analysis of the economics of the Rose Law Firm engagement reveals the flaws in this version of the retention.  McDougal agreed to put the Rose Law Firm on a $2,000 a month retainer.  As a partner in the Rose Law Firm, Mrs. Clinton earned a percentage of the firm's profits.  "[I]f all the [$2,000 a month] retainer had been earned in fees, Mrs. Clinton's share would have been less that $20 a month."775   This nominal sum of money does not support the theory that McDougal was using Madison Guaranty to bestow a financial benefit on the Clintons.  Moreover, Mrs. Clinton's share of the profits was calculated based on a "five year rolling average" of her billings for her own time.776  Unlike some law firms, the Rose Law Firm generally did not compensate partners for legal work they brought into the firm that was done by others.777  Thus, if the purpose of the Madison Guaranty engagement was to enrich the Clintons, Mrs. Clinton would have tried to bill as much time to the matter personally as possible.  As discussed above, she did not do that. 
<P>There is another significant flaw in this version of events.  McDougal claims that Governor Clinton visited him at Madison Guaranty in the summer or perhaps early fall of 1984 (according to McDougal, it was a hot day and Clinton, sweating from his jog, supposedly sat in and stained McDougal's new leather chair).778  Yet the retainer agreement and the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty did not commence until April 1985.  It seems unlikely that if Governor Clinton had asked McDougal to retain Mrs. Clinton, and if McDougal was willing to do so, that the retainer would not have been put into place and the Rose Law Firm would not have been given any legal work until some nine months later.  David Knight recalls that his lunch with Latham and Massey was in the spring of 1985,779 perhaps in February or March.780  Massey testified that it was a matter of weeks between the "pitch" to Latham and the retention of the Rose Law Firm.781  The Rose Law Firm billing records establish that the firm began working for Madison Guaranty on April 23, 1985.782  The first $2,000 monthly "retainer" payment was in April or May 1985.*  Knight recalls that it was Massey who told him that the firm had been retained by Madison Guaranty.783  All of these events are consistent with Mrs. Clinton's recollection of the circumstances of the retention and are inconsistent with McDougal's story.**
<P> c.  Conclusion
<P>Taken as a whole, it is clear that there was nothing improper or inappropriate about the retention of the Rose Law Firm by Madison Guaranty.  Madison Guaranty needed legal counsel after legal issues arose out of McDougal's plan to sell preferred stock.  The Rose Law Firm, because of Massey's relationship with Latham and the firm's expertise in securities law, was a logical choice to provide that counsel.  The Special Committee has not found any evidence that Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm was a scheme for McDougal to confer a financial benefit on the Clintons.  This conclusion is consistent with the findings of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro after a two-year investigation of Madison Guaranty.784
<P>
      2.  The Arkansas Securities Department's Regulation of Madison Guaranty
<P>  Savings and Loan

 <P>As discussed above, the Special Committee's investigation has confirmed that Mrs. Clinton's role in the representation of Madison Guaranty before the ASD was very limited.  A related issue is whether, notwithstanding the limited nature of her work on the securities matters, Mrs. Clinton sought to use her position as the Governor's wife to seek to influence the ASD.  The Special Committee has reviewed both matters -- the preferred stock proposal and the broker-deal proposal -- in which the Rose Law Firm represented Madison Guaranty before the ASD.  In each case the evidence demonstrates that there was no effort to obtain preferential treatment, and that, in fact, no preferential treatment was given.  To the contrary, the ASD under the direction of Beverly Bassett Schaffer performed its duties in an entirely appropriate manner and took no action that either improperly benefitted Madison Guaranty or that was in any way inconsistent with the public interest.
<P> a.  The Proposal to Issue Preferred Stock
<P>As noted above, on April 3, 1995, Madison Guaranty vice-president Davis Fitzhugh contacted the ASD to obtain the necessary forms for a preferred stock offering.785  ASD Chief Examiner Handley testified that Fitzhugh said he had been told other savings and loan institutions had issued preferred stock and there was a "standard form" for such stock offerings.786  Later that day, Handley sent a memorandum to Schaffer regarding his conversation with Fitzhugh on the preferred stock matter.787  In that memorandum Handley, who was not an attorney, advised Schaffer that he did not believe the Arkansas savings and loan statutes provided for the issuance of non-voting preferred stock by a state-chartered savings and loan association.788  Handley also provided Fitzhugh a copy of his April 3 memorandum, which attached copies of the Arkansas savings and loan statutes.  It appears that Fitzhugh reviewed the memorandum and the statutes Handley sent him.  An April 16 memorandum from Fitzhugh to John Latham summarizes the statutes and argues that under the statutes Madison Guaranty should be permitted to issue preferred stock.789  Since the Special Committee was not able to obtain testimony from McDougal, it was not possible to determine whether Fitzhugh's April 16 memorandum caused McDougal to write his April 18 memorandum to Latham stating he wanted the preferred stock "cleared up immediately" and to decide to retain the Rose Law Firm.
<P>   (1)  Mrs. Clinton's One Telephone Conversation with Beverly Bassett Schaffer
<P>Mrs. Clinton had one preliminary telephone conversation with Beverly Bassett Schaffer about the preferred stock matter.790  On April 29, 1985, Mrs. Clinton called Schaffer and told her that the Rose Law Firm was preparing to submit a proposal for Madison Guaranty to issue preferred stock.791  Schaffer testified that she told Mrs. Clinton she was already "familiar with that issue."792  Schaffer told Mrs. Clinton that the letter should be directed to Charles Handley, who was handling the Madison Guaranty matter.793  Mrs. Clinton does not recall anything specific about her conversation with Schaffer except that she asked to whom in the office requests concerning savings and loan associations should be directed.794  Her recollection is consistent with Schaffer's testimony and with the documentary evidence, and the Special Committee has no evidence that anything further was discussed in that telephone conversation.  That telephone call was Mrs. Clinton's only personal contact with the ASD.
<P>   (2)  Richard Massey's Work with Charles Handley
<P>On April 30, 1985, the Rose Law Firm sent a letter to Handley seeking to confirm the Rose Law Firm's legal opinion that under the Arkansas Business Corporations Act a state-chartered savings and loan association could issue a class of non-voting preferred stock.795  Schaffer was copied on the letter.  On May 6, 1985, Handley forwarded the letter to Schaffer and Assistant Securities Commissioner Nancy Jones with a handwritten note indicating that he did not agree with all aspects of the Rose Law Firm's legal analysis.796  Although Handley agreed that a state-chartered savings and loan could issue preferred stock, he believed that a different provision of Arkansas law provided the authority for the stock issuance.  The distinction here is important -- Handley did not question Madison Guaranty's ability under Arkansas law to issue preferred stock.  His concern was a narrow, technical question of what provision of Arkansas law authorized the issuance of preferred stock.  It was left to Schaffer, a lawyer with experience in securities law, to resolve that issue.  
<P>On May 14, 1985, Schaffer concluded that the Rose Law Firm's analysis was correct and that under the Arkansas Business Corporations Act a state-chartered savings and loan institution could issue non-voting preferred stock.797  Schaffer's decision has been widely misunderstood and misreported.  Contrary to the assertions in many news media reports on this matter, Schaffer's decision did not permit Madison Guaranty to sell preferred stock.  Instead, it simply cleared the way for Madison Guaranty to file an application with the ASD requesting permission to sell the stock.  In other words, even after Schaffer's May 14 letter, issuance of the stock remained subject to the approval of the ASD.  As discussed below, that approval was never granted.   
<P> b.  The Proposal to Operate a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary
<P>The preferred stock proposal was not the only matter in which the Rose Law Firm represented Madison Guaranty before the ASD.  It appears that as early as March 1985, McDougal was planning to establish a securities brokerage operation at Madison Guaranty.  Davis Fitzhugh, a former vice president of Madison Guaranty, testified that he "was hired primarily because [Madison Guaranty was] interested in having a broker/dealer network, securities sales.  I told them I was willing to take all the series licenses involved.  I didn't know anything about it, but I was willing to try to learn.  So, that's really --  that's one of the main things they hired me for, that plus general real estate development."798  On May 14, 1985, Richard Massey submitted to the ASD on behalf of Madison Guaranty an application to engage in securities brokerage activities through a second-tier service corporation.799  A thorough review of the correspondence between Massey and Handley on this proposal demonstrates that Handley and the ASD clearly were not giving Madison Guaranty or the Rose Law Firm any special treatment.  That correspondence is described below.  
<P>On May 22, 1985, a week after Massey submitted the securities brokerage application, Handley forwarded a memorandum to Schaffer and Jones listing eleven issues that he had identified in his review of the application.800  Handley also sent Massey a copy of his memorandum.  In addition to issues relating to filing procedures and information about the proposed broker-dealer subsidiary, Handley identified two significant issues relating to the ASD's regulation of the parent company.  First, Handley noted that the ASD would need to review current financial statements for Madison Guaranty to determine whether "the total aggregate outstanding investment in capital stock, obligations or other securities of service corporations and subsidiaries and joint ventures" exceeded 6% of Madison Guaranty's assets, a limitation imposed by ASD Rule V(C) (the "six percent rule").801  Second, Handley noted that Madison Guaranty's most recent financial statements, for year-end 1984, indicated that the institution did not meet the FHLBB minimum net worth requirements.802  Handley recommended to Schaffer and Jones that Madison Guaranty be required to submit their current net worth calculation and a plan to cure any deficiency before the ASD would approve the securities brokerage proposal.    
 <P>On June 17, 1985, Massey replied to Handley's letter of May 22, indicating that his letter was an amended application on behalf of Madison Guaranty.803  Massey's June 17 letter outlined steps that Madison Guaranty would take to correct the institution's net worth deficiency, including issuance of "a new class of preferred stock."804  Despite the proposal outlined in Massey's June 17 letter, Handley took the position that Madison Guaranty would have to comply with federal net worth requirements before the ASD would approve the brokerage subsidiary proposal.  On June 18, 1985, after reviewing the amended application submitted by Massey, Handley sent a memorandum to Jones and Schaffer stating that the application should not be approved "until the Association has filed proof it has met the [FHLBB] minimum net worth requirement and even then our approval would need to be conditioned on receiving the FHLBB's principal supervisory agent's approval" (under the so-called "direct investment rule").805  Handley also continued to insist that Madison Guaranty provide additional financial information so the ASD could confirm that the institution's proposed investment in the broker-dealer would not exceed the six percent rule limitation on investments in service corporations.806   
<P>The significance of Handley's position on these two regulatory requirements, as documented in his June 18 memorandum, is that it dispels any suggestion that the ASD was "going easy" on Madison Guaranty.  Handley, supported by Schaffer, was requiring Madison Guaranty to meet all applicable regulatory requirements before the ASD would permit the institution to operate a broker-dealer subsidiary.* 
<P>On July 10, 1995, Massey sent a letter to Handley in response to Handley's June 18 memorandum, arguing that the direct investment rule was inapplicable because the "investment in question was one of the service corporation and not of Madison."807  Massey argued that the rule prohibited only direct investments by savings and loans in a service corporation, so in the Madison Guaranty situation, where the brokerage firm would be a second-tier investment by an existing service corporation, prior approval by the FHLBB was not required.808  On July, 17, 1985, Handley forwarded Massey's letter of July 10th to Schaffer and Jones, stating that he disagreed with Massey's position and also had concerns about the effect on net worth of certain adjustments to Madison Guaranty's December 31, 1984 audited financial statements.809  Handley told Schaffer and Jones that he "would recommend that the approval of this application be conditioned on the Association meeting the net worth requirements of the FHLBB or at a minimum the Association filing a detailed and reasonable plan which reflects that these net worth requirements will be met within a very short time."810  Again, Massey was copied on the memorandum. 
<P>  On July 25, 1985, Massey wrote another letter to Schaffer indicating that the adjustments to Madison Guaranty's year-end 1984 financial statements were a result of the differences in calculating "net worth" under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and regulatory accounting principles (RAP).811  Massey also proposed that Madison Guaranty be permitted to operate the brokerage subsidiary and use profits from that and other new business ventures, as well as savings from plans to reduce operating expenses, to cure the net worth deficiency.  On July 27, 1985, Handley sent a memorandum to Schaffer and Jones stating that he had reviewed Massey's letter of July 25 and concluded that the year-end 1984 adjustments would not decrease Madison Guaranty's net worth.812  Handley continued to recommend, however, that Madison Guaranty's application to operate a securities brokerage be conditioned on Madison Guaranty's submission of either proof that it was in compliance with FHLBB net worth requirements or a detailed plan outlining steps to come into compliance.  He rejected the proposal Massey had submitted, on behalf of Madison Guaranty, that the net worth deficiency be cured with net profits generated from proposed new business ventures (including the proposed brokerage subsidiary) and the future reduction of operating expenses.813
<P>Efforts by Madison Guaranty and Massey to satisfy the requirements imposed by the ASD continued through 1985.  On September 9, 1985, Massey forwarded to Schaffer a letter outlining two proposed actions Madison Guaranty would take to come into compliance with the FHLBB net worth requirements by December 31, 1985.814  Massey's letter acknowledged that as of June 30, 1985, Madison Guaranty was not in compliance with the applicable FHLBB minimum net worth requirement.815  Massey proposed that Madison Guaranty would cure the net worth deficiency before year-end with a $3 million offering of preferred stock and an offering of limited partnership units of Madison Guaranty, with Madison Financial Corporation as the general partner.816  
<P>On September 12, 1985, after reviewing the proposal set forth in Massey's letter of September 9, Handley prepared a handwritten memorandum to Schaffer advising her that Madison Guaranty's net worth deficiency had "increased greatly since March 31, 1985."817  Handley recommended that, at a minimum, the ASD should condition the approval of the securities brokerage application on three factors: 1) Madison Guaranty filing documents which reflected the "exact terms and conditions" of the preferred stock offering; 2) an opinion by counsel that the preferred stock would meet all the conditions necessary under FHLBB rules to be included in regulatory net worth; and, 3) that Madison Guaranty would file a statement reflecting that the institution could successfully complete its stock offering in the stated time period.818  
<P>Schaffer accepted Handley's recommendation, and on October 17, 1985, she sent a letter to Massey indicating that Madison Guaranty's request to engage in brokerage activities had been approved on September 20, 1985, "conditioned upon Madison's [compliance with] the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's minimum net worth requirements by December 31, 1985."819  Schaffer also asked Madison Guaranty to keep the ASD informed on the status of "Madison's efforts to achieve compliance."820  On December 9, 1985, Handley wrote to Massey that the ASD was "concerned about the ability of Madison to complete the sale of such stock and meet the minimum net worth requirements of the Bank Board by December 31, 1985, as earlier agreed."821   <P>On December 18, 1985, Madison Guaranty acknowledged that it could not meet the conditions for engaging in securities brokerage activities that had been imposed by the ASD: "Madison acknowledges that it has not met the FHL[B]B's minimum net worth requirements, and that the successful implementation of steps which would satisfy such requirements was a condition to your approval of the Application.  Thus, Madison undertakes that it will not engage in brokerage activities until it has received approval from [the ASD] with respect to such activity."822   The requirements imposed by the ASD were never met.  
<P>Despite the months of work by Massey and the Rose Law Firm,* Madison Guaranty never issued any preferred stock and never operated a broker-dealer subsidiary.  It is abundantly clear that the institution received no preferential treatment from Schaffer or the ASD in connection with its application to issue preferred stock and operate a brokerage subsidiary.
<P> c.  Beverly Bassett Schaffer's Efforts to Close Madison Guaranty
<P>Madison Guaranty's financial condition continued to worsen in the first half of 1986.  On July 11, 1986, Schaffer attended a meeting in Dallas between the FHLBB regulators and the Madison Guaranty board of directors.  In attendance were Schaffer and Handley from the ASD; Rolf Coburn, Bob Young, Dawn Pulcer, James Clark, Chip Kieswieter, Larry Stacy, and Walter Faulk from the FHLBB; Karen Bruton from the Enforcement Division of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (the "FSLIC"), the predecessor to the Resolution Trust Corporation; Steve Cuffman, Dennis Edwards, John Latham, Jack Owen, Sarah Hawkins, and Charles Peacock from Madison Guaranty board of directors; and John Selig and Breck Speed of the Mitchell, Williams & Selig law firm, outside counsel to Madison Guaranty.823  McDougal was not present, and no one from the Rose Law Firm attended the meeting.  
<P>At the meeting, the regulators confronted the board of directors with findings of regulatory violations at Madison Guaranty and advised the board of directors that the McDougals would have to be removed from any role at the institution.824  Faulk identified a number of serious problems at Madison Guaranty, including: 1) net worth $1.6 million short of FHLBB regulations; 2) uncontrolled growth of deposits; 3) accounting mismanagement; 4) excessive compensation for McDougal and Latham; 5) "misuse of position and usurpation of corporate opportunities"; and 6) inaccurate and unsupported appraisals and projections.825  Handley testified that the ASD was in complete agreement with the federal officials and concurred with the action against McDougal.826  FHLBB officials have stated that Schaffer and the ASD were fully supportive of the FHLBB's position and took no action to interfere with or impede the actions of the federal regulators.827  
<P>At the meeting, Selig proposed a consulting agreement or a voting trust for the McDougals, but the federal regulators insisted that the McDougals had to be removed from any association with Madison Guaranty and its affiliates.828  The McDougals resigned from their positions at Madison Financial later that month.829  Latham also was removed.830  Board member Steve Cuffman assumed the title of Madison Guaranty chief executive officer and oversaw Madison Guaranty's operation until a new chief executive was put in place by the federal regulators. 
<P>After the July 11 meeting, Schaffer provided a copy of a June 19, 1986 FHLBB letter on Madison Guaranty to Sam Bratton, an aide in Governor Clinton's office who was responsible for state savings and loan matters.831  Schaffer testified that she sent the FHLBB letter and a July 2 cover note to Bratton because she was concerned that McDougal might seek to have the governor's office intercede on his behalf because of his longstanding relationship with Governor Clinton.832  At the time Schaffer knew that McDougal had been an aide during Clinton's first term as governor and was a political supporter, but she did not know that Clinton had any business ties to McDougal.833  Schaffer also feared that depositors would be concerned about their accounts at Madison Guaranty and might contact the governor's office, and she wanted Bratton to be prepared for any such calls.834  With respect to the latter concern, Schaffer testified that it was her regular practice* to inform the governor's office before a savings and loan association was closed.835  
<P>The June 19 FHLBB letter that Schaffer attached to her note to Bratton had already been sent to Madison Guaranty, so Schaffer was not releasing any non-public information to the governor's office.  In addition, FHLBB regulators had contacted McDougal directly and advised him that the FHLBB would be taking over management of the institution and that he would be removed.836  Schaffer testified that she does not believe that anything untoward, irregular, or improper resulted from her communication with Bratton.837  Bratton838 and Betsey Wright,839 the former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, confirmed that Schaffer's action was appropriate and consistent with past practice in matters involving troubled financial institutions.  Clearly, nothing was done by ASD officials to thwart the decision to remove the McDougals.840
<P>Ultimately, it was Schaffer who insisted that Madison Guaranty be closed by the federal regulators.841   Although a cease and desist order was entered against Madison Guaranty shortly after the July meeting in Dallas,842 the ASD did not have proof that Madison Guaranty was insolvent until late 1987, when the institution's independent auditors completed an annual audit of the thrift.  On December 10, 1987, after reviewing the independent auditors' report on Madison Guaranty's financial condition at year-end 1986, Schaffer recommended to the FHLBB that the institution be closed, "since it is apparent now that [Madison Guaranty] cannot be restored to solvency without assistance of the FSLIC and since it appears unlikely that the FHLBB will succeed in finding a purchaser or merger partner, [the ASD] must request that [Madison Guaranty] be transferred immediately to the FSLIC."843  The FHLBB refused to take action to close the institution, however, and as a practical matter there was nothing further Schaffer and the ASD could do without the support of the federal officials.
<P>The Committee found no evidence that Schaffer and the ASD failed to take timely and  appropriate action to close Madison Guaranty.  While the ASD theoretically could have brought a lawsuit in state court to have Madison Guaranty closed and placed in a receivership, the ASD would have had the burden of proving that Madison Guaranty was insolvent.  Prior to receiving the December 1987 audit report, the ASD had no such proof.  More important, even after receiving the December 1987 audit report, the ASD did not have funds to pay off depositors if Madison Guaranty had been closed by the state.844  Schaffer testified that if the institution had been closed without paying off depositors, it might have precipitated "panic" and led to a state-wide banking crisis.845  Former FHLBB supervisory agent Walter Faulk agreed that this would have been "a rather foolish move on [ASD's] part because you would raise concerns within the community."846  Handley testified that if the ASD had moved forward and filed for receivership, it would have been "disastrous to the insurance system in the State of Arkansas."847  Under these circumstances it is not surprising that the ASD deferred to the federal regulators and did not act unilaterally to close the institution.  The federal regulators did not close Madison Guaranty until February 28, 1989.848  This delay was the result of the failure of the federal authorities to act on Schaffer's December 1987 recommendation and was in no way caused by Schaffer or other Arkansas officials.  Although the Special Committee did not investigate the effect this delay had on the losses associated with Madison Guaranty, it is likely that those losses would have been reduced if the federal authorities had heeded Schaffer's recommendation and closed the institution in 1987.
<P> d.  Conclusions
<P>   (1)  The Securities Law Matters on which the Rose Law Firm Advised Madison
<P><P>Guaranty Were Not Unusual or Inappropriate

<P>The documents and testimony that the Special Committee has obtained provide a number of insights into the work the Rose Law Firm did for Madison Guaranty on the preferred stock and brokerage subsidiary proposals.  The evidence establishes that the Rose Law Firm confronted regulatory obstacles at the ASD and performed significant legal services over the course of several months seeking to satisfy those regulatory impediments.  This is the kind of legal work that large law firms routinely do for to their clients, and there was nothing unusual or inappropriate about the securities law work the Rose Law Firm did for Madison Guaranty.
<P>Furthermore, the activities that Madison Guaranty was seeking to have approved by the ASD were lawful so long as the applicable regulatory requirements were satisfied.  The preferred stock offering in particular, if successful, would have benefitted both depositors and regulators because it would have increased the institution's net worth and improved its financial condition.  In the mid-1980s it was a common industry practice for savings and loan associations to issue preferred stock, and financially troubled institutions even were encouraged to do so by federal regulators.849  Schaffer testified that federal regulators were recommending that troubled thrifts raise additional capital by issuing preferred stock, "particularly for small savings and loans, [or] closely held entities without a market."850  This policy was reflected in FHLBB regulations in effect at the time.  On July 12, 1984, the FHLBB had issued regulations authorizing a federally chartered savings and loan association to establish a subsidiary "whose sole purpose is to issue debt or equity securities that the association is authorized to issue directly . . . and to remit the net proceeds of such issuance to the association. . . ."851  In May 1985, the FHLBB reported it was "aware that during the past year many institutions [had issued] subordinated debt to "limited purpose" finance subsidiaries which obtained the funds to purchase the subordinated debt by issuing preferred stock to independent third parties."852   Thus, the preferred stock proposal that Madison Guaranty and the Rose Law Firm presented to the ASD was consistent with both federal regulatory policy and the actions of similarly situated financial institutions.
<P>Finally, the correspondence between Massey and Handley, coupled with the Rose Law Firm billing records, establishes conclusively that Massey without question did most of the Rose Law Firm legal work on the securities matters involving the ASD.  Mrs. Clinton's role was relatively minor, and Massey was the point of contact for both the regulators and the client.  Mrs. Clinton had only one contact with the ASD, and nothing improper resulted from that contact.  This finding is consistent with the position Mrs. Clinton has taken since questions first arose about the work the Rose Law Firm did for Madison Guaranty.  Nothing the Special Committee has found calls into question the accuracy of Mrs. Clinton's prior statements regarding the nature and amount her work for Madison Guaranty on the securities law matters.
<P>   (2)  Madison Guaranty Received No Preferential Treatment
<P>The correspondence between the ASD and the Rose Law Firm also shows that Beverly Bassett Schaffer delegated both Madison Guaranty securities matters to Charles Handley, a career official of the ASD, for review and analysis.  Handley was a 16-year veteran of the Department and a career regulator, not a political appointee.853  He conducted a thorough, rigorous and fair review of Madison Guaranty's proposals and did not hesitate to point out deficiencies and withhold regulatory approval where appropriate.  The positions taken by the ASD were based on Handley's interpretation of the applicable laws and regulations, and Handley testified that no one ever pressured him to relax these requirements on behalf of Madison Guaranty.854  When the Rose Law Firm took issue with Handley's interpretations of the legal requirements, he did not simply acquiesce to the law firm's arguments.  Instead, he held firm to his position and demanded compliance with regulatory requirements.
<P>Perhaps most important, Beverly Bassett Schaffer supported Handley's recommendations and never took any action to relax the applicable regulatory requirements or to give Madison Guaranty and the Rose Law Firm special treatment.  Schaffer, Handley and ASD staff attorney William Brady all testified that at no point did either Governor Clinton or Mrs. Clinton ask Schaffer to do anything illegal or improper.855   In particular, Schaffer testified that she did not attach any particular significance to her one telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.856  Nor did anyone in the Governor's office put any political pressure on Schaffer or any other ASD staff to give Madison Guaranty special treatment.857  In short, Schaffer behaved exactly as an appointed regulatory official should in relying upon the expertise of her professional staff to identify applicable regulatory requirements and then insisting that all such requirements be met before her department approved Madison Guaranty's proposals.  Because those requirements were never satisfied, the proposals were never approved by the ASD.
<P>The propriety of the actions taken by the ASD is evidenced by the fact that the federal regulators have since praised Schaffer's actions.  Walter Faulk, the former FHLBB supervisory agent for Arkansas savings and loan institutions, has stated that Schaffer "acted responsibly at all times and I don't see how anyone that knew the history of this case,. . . could say that she acted irresponsibly or delayed or drug her feet in any manner whatsoever."858  The Special Committee has found no contrary evidence.  Schaffer at all times acted responsibly and ethically in her dealings with the Rose Law Firm on the Madison Guaranty matter.  
<P>      3.  The IDC Real Estate Transactions
<P>In the late summer and fall of 1985, the Rose Law Firm provided some legal services to Madison Guaranty in connection with the purchase of a large tract of land south of Little Rock from the Industrial Development Corporation ("IDC").  The work done by the Rose Law Firm, and especially Hillary Rodham Clinton, on IDC matters has been the subject of considerable attention.  The focus of that attention has been on whether Mrs. Clinton or other Rose Law Firm lawyers had any involvement in aspects of the IDC transaction that may have been unlawful.  The Special Committee investigation found no credible evidence that the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton were involved in or aware of any unlawful activity involving the IDC property.  The evidence the Special Committee has collected that is relevant to this issue is discussed below.


<P> a.  The Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton Played No Role in the Alleged
<P><P>"Straw Buyer" Arrangement Between Seth Ward and James McDougal

<P>On or about August 2, 1985, the Rose Law Firm opened a client billing number (used to record lawyer time and expenses in the firm's internal accounting system for billing purposes) entitled "Madison Guaranty - IDC."859  Mrs. Clinton, who was the "billing partner" on other work the Rose Law Firm already was doing for Madison Guaranty (discussed above), has no recollection of how the IDC work came into the Rose Law Firm.860  Webster Hubbell, however, reportedly has said that his father-in-law Seth Ward, who was working for Madison Guaranty at the time, referred the matter to the Rose Law Firm at the direction of James McDougal.861
<P>Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that real estate partner Thomas Thrash began working on the IDC transaction on August 6, when he reviewed a draft contract for the sale of the property to Madison Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty.862  Thrash exchanged drafts of the sales contract with IDC's attorney, Darrell Dover, throughout August.863  The Rose Law Firm billed Madison Guaranty $654.30 for services provided by Thrash in August 1985 on the acquisition of the IDC property.864  Rose Law Firm associate Davis Thomas, Jr. also worked on the acquisition of the IDC property in August 1985, and the Rose Law Firm billed Madison Guaranty $90.00 for his work.865  Mrs. Clinton did not do any work on the IDC matter in August 1985.866  
<P>The principal issue relating to the Rose Law Firm's work in connection with the acquisition of the IDC property is whether Rose Law Firm attorneys knew or should have known that Seth Ward, who purchased some 650 acres of the IDC property for $1.15 million, may have been a nominee or "straw buyer" for Madison Guaranty.867  (Madison Financial Corporation purchased the remaining 400 acres of the IDC property.)868  The straw buyer issue is pertinent because if Ward was acting as a straw buyer for Madison Guaranty, the transaction may have been a violation of an Arkansas law limiting the size of investments by state-regulated savings and loan associations.869  John Latham870 and Davis Fitzhugh871 also have testified that they understood that Ward purchased a portion of the IDC property because of limits on the amount Madison Guaranty could invest in a service corporation (Madison Financial).  Former Madison Guaranty loan officer Don Denton reportedly has stated that the purpose of the transaction was to avoid the investment limitation.872
<P>   (1)  The Purchase of the IDC Property by Madison Financial and Seth Ward
<P>In 1985 Ward was employed by Madison Guaranty on a part-time basis to look for real estate investment opportunities in the Little Rock area.  Ward testified873 that James McDougal wanted to acquire an easement through the IDC property to gain access to a "landlocked" piece of property that McDougal intended to buy from International Paper Corporation.*  When Ward contacted IDC, they were unwilling to sell an easement, but offered to sell the entire property.874  Ward recalls that he reported back to McDougal, and McDougal said Madison Guaranty was not interested in purchasing such a large piece of property.875  John Latham confirms that McDougal was interested in acquiring only a portion of the IDC property -- "just one area on 145th Street that he wanted to develop as a residential area."876  Ward went back to IDC and negotiated a lower price, and then told McDougal he intended to purchase the entire property himself.  Ward recalls that McDougal responded, "Well, at that price, we'd like to share it with you."877  Again, Latham's recollection is consistent.  Latham testified: "It was a very good purchase, and I think that both Seth wanted to make as much money on it as possible and Jim McDougal wanted to make as much money as possible.  And so they split it up."**
<P>Despite the testimony of Ward and Latham, it is not clear when the decision was made that Ward would purchase a portion of the IDC property and Madison Financial would purchase the remainder of the property.  The initial drafts of the contract for the sale of the IDC property indicated that the entire property would be purchased by Madison Financial or its "affiliate."878  Subsequent drafts changed the wording of the contract from "affiliate" to "any individual or entity" designated by Madison Financial, language that would more clearly include Ward.879  Ward ultimately purchased approximately 650 acres of the IDC property, the portion of the property north of 145th Street, for $1.15 million.880  Madison Guaranty loaned Ward the entire purchase price of the property on a "non-recourse" basis -- Ward was not personally liable, and the loan was secured only by the property:  
<P><P>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, makers and payee covenant and agree that makers, their heirs and assigns shall not be personally liable to the holders of this note for any default which may occur in the performance of any of the terms hereof  . . . . The sole remedy of the maker(s) in the event of any such default shall be to proceed against the collateral encumbered mortgage securing [the property.]881
<P>
Madison Financial purchased the remaining 400 acres of the property, the property south of 145th Street, for $600,000.882   Madison Financial also paid Ward $35,000 for a 270-day option to purchase the property from Ward, one version of which excludes 22.5 acres of the property (the Holman Acres parcel).*  In addition, Madison Financial agreed to pay Ward a ten percent commission* on all sales of IDC commercial property.883 
<P>Don Denton recently told the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that it is "his opinion" that the non-recourse wording of the note agreement, quoted above, was supplied by Webster Hubbell.884  He previously has made contradictory statements, however, and he reportedly refused to be sworn at his FDIC interview.  Denton was interviewed by Pillsbury Madison & Sutro on April 28, 1994, and questioned about the IDC transaction.  The memorandum of that interview indicates that on two occasions Denton stated that he was not aware that anyone from the Rose Law Firm provided advice or counsel to Ward on the transaction.885 In light of these prior statements, it is not clear why Denton now, two years later, has an "opinion" that Hubbell supplied the non-recourse language.**
<P>The terms of Ward's purchase, particularly the non-recourse financing, the option, and the commission agreement, have been viewed as indicating that Ward may have been a "straw buyer" for Madison Guaranty.886  Both Ward887 and Latham888 dispute the allegation that Ward was a "straw buyer" who "warehoused" the IDC commercial property for Madison Guaranty.  James Clark, the bank examiner who was in charge of the examination of Madison Guaranty in 1986, recently told the FDIC that in his view Ward was acting as a "straw buyer" in the transaction, however.889  
<P>For purposes of the Special Committee's investigation, the important issue is not whether Ward was in fact a "straw buyer," but whether Rose Law Firm attorneys were aware of the questionable aspects of Ward's arrangement with McDougal.  As discussed below, while the evidence is mixed on the question of whether Ward was in fact a straw buyer, there is no credible evidence that anyone at the Rose Law Firm (except perhaps Hubbell)* knew that Ward might have been acting as a straw buyer for Madison Guaranty.
<P>Rose Law Firm attorneys did not work on the IDC acquisition after August 1985, when drafts of the transaction documents were being prepared indicating that Madison Financial or an "individual or entity" designated by Madison Financial** would purchase the entire IDC parcel, until October 1985, when Thrash attended the closing.890  It was during this interim period that Ward and McDougal reached some agreement, set out in the differing versions of the September 24 letter agreements, that Ward would purchase a portion of the IDC property, would give Madison Financial an option on some or all of the property he purchased, and would be paid a ten percent commission on all sales of IDC commercial property.891  No time records, billing statements, documents, or testimony has been obtained by the Special Committee which would suggest that Rose Law Firm attorneys (except perhaps Hubbell, as discussed below) were involved in the agreement between Ward and McDougal.
<P>Ward testified that in September 1985 he asked Hubbell to assist him with documenting his arrangement with McDougal, but Hubbell declined to do so because the Rose Law Firm already represented Madison Guaranty.892  Rose Law Firm billing records do not contain any time entries for work relating to the September 24 letter agreement.  Hubbell testified that Ward had "multiple conversations" with him regarding the IDC transaction.893  Hubbell also testified that it was his "understanding, and that's again based on conversations [with Ward], was that when it came close to closing that there was some concern about Madison taking all of the property in its name and that Mr. Ward offered to take a portion in his name until it was sold, if Madison would lend him the money to do so."894  Hubbell said he believes he obtained this information at some time after the closing, however.895  There is no evidence that Hubbell shared this information with other Rose Law Firm lawyers.*  Mrs. Clinton has stated that she knows nothing about an agreement between Ward and McDougal,896 and that she had nothing to do with the preparation of the September 24 letter agreement.897 
<P>Although Thomas Thrash attended the IDC closing on October 4, 1985,898 and thus would have known that Ward was buying a portion of the property with financing provided by Madison Guaranty, he would not have known from the closing documents that the financing was non-recourse.  The promissory note with the non-recourse terms was not executed until October 15, almost two weeks after the closing.899  Moreover, there is no reason that Thrash or any other Rose Law Firm attorney (including Mrs. Clinton) would have questioned Ward's involvement in the transaction or doubted that Ward was a bona fide purchaser.  Ward was an established, successful business leader in Little Rock, and Thrash and other Rose Law Firm lawyers would have known that Ward had the financial wherewithal to purchase a portion of the IDC property if he wished to do so.900  Thus Ward's involvement in the transaction made economic sense and in itself would not have suggested any scheme to evade a regulatory requirement.901  In short, there was nothing about the transaction that would have put the Rose Law Firm on notice that Ward was anything other than a bona fide purchaser of a portion of the IDC property.
<P>   (2)  Other Ward/Madison Guaranty Loans
<P>On March 31, 1986, Ward borrowed $400,000 from Madison Guaranty.902  A signed copy of the March 31, 1986 note from Don Denton's files states that the loan is secured by a "mortgage covering real estate," and that "[t]he purpose of this loan is business investment."903  The loan committee minutes approving the loan states that the purposes of the loan were to "pay a personal debt; pay income taxes; purchase airplanes."904  The loan was secured with a mortgage on the Holman Acres property, and a March 31, 1986 mortgage to Madison Guaranty in the amount of $400,000 attaches a legal description* of the Holman Acres property.905
<P>As noted above, in 1987 Ward sued Madison Guaranty for his commissions on the IDC transaction, and at that trial he testified that the purpose of the two loans was in order to meet his cash needs because "they [Madison Financial] didn't have any cash to pay me the commission with, so they offered to loan me money from Madison [Guaranty] Savings & Loan."906  In his second FDIC interview, on June 11, 1996, Denton stated that he understood that the $400,000 loan to Ward was made because Madison Guaranty did not have the money to pay Ward the commissions he was due on the sales of IDC property, so either Latham or McDougal suggested that Ward be loaned $400,000.907  Denton also said that he understood that the $400,000 loan represented $300,000 in commissions, $70,000 to repay the outstanding balance Ward owed on a February 25, 1986 loan which had been used to pay off his remaining debt on the IDC purchase, and $30,000 for interest.908
<P>Documents also indicate that Madison Financial borrowed $300,000 from (or at least acknowledged a debt of $300,000 to) Ward on or about April 7, 1986.  An April 4, 1986 Madison Guaranty board resolution, notarized on April 7, states: "BE IT RESOLVED that Madison Financial Corporation is authorized to borrow $300,000 from Seth Ward."909  Denton told the FDIC that the purpose of the Ward "loan" to Madison Financial was to give Ward "greater protection in the form of notes to set off his loans" in connection with the commissions he was owed on the IDC sales.910  Ward testified in 1987, in his lawsuit against Madison Guaranty, that the purpose of the $300,000 loan to Madison Financial was that if Madison Financial was unable to pay him his commissions he "wanted a note from them indicating that they owed me at least that much money so I could start drawing interest on it as long as I was going to have to pay interest on the money I had to borrow from the S&L."911 
<P>At his first FDIC interview,912 on June 3, 1996, Denton was shown an April 7, 1986 entry from the Rose Law Firm billing records by Mrs. Clinton recording a "telephone conference with Don Denton."913  At that time he told the FDIC investigator that he "had no recollection of the call, and believed that the entry may have been in error.914  At his second interview, on June 11, Denton changed his story.  On June 11, he told the FDIC investigators that he believes he discussed the Ward loans with Mrs. Clinton on April 7, 1986.915  Denton apparently bases this new recollection at least in part on an April 7 [1986] telephone message916 to him from "Sandra of Hillary Clinton's Office" that is attached to a page of Denton's handwritten notes relating to the "Babcock"* matter.917  Denton said he recalls that he returned Mrs. Clinton's telephone call and spoke with her about "the $400,000 loan to Ward, #4027, and the $400,000 loan from Ward to [Madison Financial]."918  Denton said he vaguely recalls that Mrs. Clinton may have been preparing the loan documents, and that when he told her he had already prepared the documents, she asked him to send her copies.919  (The fact that Denton believes he spoke with Mrs. Clinton about the $400,000 Madison Guaranty loan to Ward and provided her with a copy of the loan documents may be particularly significant, for reasons that are discussed below.)  <P>Denton also now claims that during his telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton he told her that "there could be a problem with the notes as they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary."920  Denton told the FDIC that Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" his concern "in a manner which he took to mean that he was to take care of savings and loan matters, and that she would take care of legal matters."921  Denton told the FDIC that he expressed the same concern about the notes to Ward "shortly after" the telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.922  When asked if he knew why Mrs. Clinton had called him on the matter, Denton said he was "reasonably confident" that she was acting on Webster Hubbell's behalf.923  Denton did not give a reason why he believed Mrs. Clinton was acting on Hubbell's behalf, and he said his only contact with Mrs. Clinton relating to Madison Guaranty was on the Babcock matter.924
<P>Putting aside for the moment the possible significance of Denton's telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton, if it occurred, the manner and timing of Denton's new "refreshed" recollection raises questions.  In addition to the obvious improbability of forgetting a conversation with the First Lady of Arkansas for ten years (during which time the matters at issue were the subject of first litigation, then extensive national press attention), Denton's new story suffers from some significant flaws and internal inconsistencies.  First, he had a copy of the April 7 telephone message and a copy of the Rose Law Firm billing records925 when he first was interviewed by the FDIC, so there was no information provided to him at his first FDIC interview that he did not already have.  (It also is reasonable to assume that between January 1996, when the Rose Law Firm billing records were discovered, and his June 3, 1996 FDIC interview, Denton was questioned in detail by the staff of the Independent Counsel about the entries in the billing records that refer to him.)  These circumstances hardly provide a satisfactory explanation for how Denton came to suddenly recall a ten-year old telephone discussion with Mrs. Clinton.
<P>Other flaws in Denton's new story are also troubling. The April 7 telephone message slip does not indicate the subject of the call, but it appears to have been attached to a page of Denton's handwritten notes926 that seem to relate only to the Babcock matter.  Mrs. Clinton has five time entries in the Rose Law Firm billing records, starting on April 9, 1986, and ending on May 6, 1986, that all were billed to the Babcock matter.927  Her April 9, May 1, and May 6 time entries all reflect telephone conversations with Denton relating to the Babcock matter.928  Moreover, all of Mrs. Clinton's time for discussions with Denton except the April 7 entry were billed to the Babcock matter.  This suggests that the April 7 discussion also related to the Babcock matter.  In short, the fact that the April 7 telephone message was attached to notes about the Babcock matter, coupled with the fact that all of Mrs. Clinton's time entries for discussions with Denton relate to that matter, call into question Denton's new "refreshed" recollection that he spoke with Mrs. Clinton about the Ward loans, and not the Babcock matter. 
<P>Denton's new story has another significant flaw.  His documents contain two copies of the March 31, 1986 loan agreement for $400,000 loan from Madison Guaranty to Ward secured by a mortgage on the Holman Acres property.929  With those notes is a mortgage dated March 31, 1986930 and attached legal description of the Holman Acres property.931  That legal description is the correct legal description of the Holman Acres property.  (As discussed in a more detail below, the May 1, 1986 option agreement for the Holman Acres property that Mrs. Clinton prepared had an incorrect legal description of the property.)  It is hard to understand how, if Denton provided Mrs. Clinton the Ward loan agreement with the correct legal description of the Holman Acres property on April 7, she would have prepared an option agreement on May 1 with an incorrect legal description of the same property.  
<P>Finally, and consistent with Mrs. Clinton not having been provided a correct legal description of the Holman Acres property when she prepared the option agreement on May 1, the Madison Financial board resolution of May 1 (notarized May 5 and signed by John Latham) that approves the option agreement contains an incorrect legal description of the Holman Acres property -- the same incorrect legal description that is in the May 1 option that Mrs. Clinton prepared.932  This common mistake strongly suggests that neither Mrs. Clinton nor the preparer of the May 1 board resolution had been provided the note agreement for the Ward $400,000 loan secured by the mortgage Holman Acres property that attached the correct legal description of the property.
<P>Taken together, the unusual circumstances of Denton's sudden recollection of the telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton after ten years and the contemporaneous documentation that appears to contradict Denton's story raise serious questions about his credibility.  In any event, as discussed below, even if Denton did discuss the Ward loans with Mrs. Clinton, it does not suggest that her actions in preparing the May 1 option agreement were in any way improper. 
<P>   (3)  The May 1, 1986 Option Agreement
<P>On or about May 1, 1986, Madison Financial paid Ward $1,000 for an option to purchase the Holman Acres property for $400,000.933  There are two signed versions of the option agreement, with different legal descriptions of the property that is the subject of the option.  It appears that Mrs. Clinton prepared the first version of the option agreement, with an incorrect legal description, and the first two pages were later retyped to change the description to the Holman Acres property.*  Denton told the FDIC investigators that he had the option agreement retyped after a bank examiner pointed out the incorrect legal description.934  
<P>There is no dispute that Mrs. Clinton had some involvement in the preparation of the first version of the option.  According to the Rose Law Firm, the computer document code that appears on the first version of the document, and that is on all but the first two (retyped) pages of the second version, indicates the document was prepared by Mrs. Clinton.935  In addition, Mrs. Clinton's time records contain an entry on May 1, 1986, billed to "Madison Guaranty General" recording two hours of time for "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Schauffler [Ward's accountant]; prepare option."936  There are no records indicating that any other Rose Law Firm attorneys worked on the May 1 option agreement.
<P>Mrs. Clinton has testified that she has no recollection of preparing the option937 and has no recollection of the two hours referenced in her time records, other than what the records state.938  She did speculate that perhaps Ward "had something that had already been prepared by somebody else and wanted my secretary to make some changes in it.  That was not uncommon for Mr. Ward, and I would have talked to him about it and maybe he needed some piece of information from Mr. Schaufele [sic]."939  
<P>In his 1987 lawsuit against Madison Guaranty Ward testified under oath that the option had nothing to do with the commissions on the IDC transactions.940  Ward reaffirmed his 1987 testimony in 1996 when he was deposed, again under oath, by the staff of the Special Committee:941
<P><P>Q: Did you view that option agreement as having anything to do with the commissions that you felt were owed by Madison?

<P><P>A: No. They paid me $1,000 for that option.

<P><P>Q: They wanted to buy the property, so they paid you $1,000 for an option on it?

<P><P>A: That's right.
<P>
In that deposition Ward also disputed testimony by John Latham in the 1987 trial that the exercise of the option was to be the means by which Ward was paid his commissions:942
<P><P>Q: That's not your understanding of what happened?

<P><P>A: No, it wasn't.

<P><P>Q: And again, why do you think Mr. Latham's testimony is wrong?

<P><P>A: Because that's not the way it was.

<P><P>Q: And why was that not the way it was?

<P><P>A: I guess they were trying to win their trial.
<P>
The jury found for Ward in the 1987 trial943 and, as the 1987 and 1996 testimony set out above shows, Ward has consistently denied that the option agreement was related to his commissions.  This point is significant, less so today as to whether or not the option in fact had anything to do with the commissions, than to what Mrs. Clinton may have been told at the time about the option.  Since for ten years Ward has consistently sworn, under penalty of perjury, that the option had nothing to do with the IDC commissions, there is no reason to believe he told Mrs. Clinton anything different in 1986.  (Ward testified in his February 1996 Special Committee deposition that he does not recall discussing the May 1 option agreement with Mrs. Clinton.)944
  <P>Thus while the available evidence indicates that Mrs. Clinton played some role in the preparation of the first version of the option, and Denton's recent recollections (if credited) suggest that she may have been aware of Ward's loans when she prepared the option, there is no evidence that she knew anything about Ward's agreement with Madison Guaranty regarding the purchase of the IDC property the prior year.*  She only recorded two hours, in total, for work relating to the preparation of the option.945  Her April 7 time entry for the discussion with Denton shows that she spoke with Denton for only two-tenths of an hour -- twelve minutes.946  The option she prepared contained an incorrect legal description of the property and the first two pages were subsequently retyped at Denton's direction to reference the correct property.  As Pillsbury Madison & Sutro noted:  "This [the incorrect legal description] suggests that Mrs. Clinton had not been told the entire reason, or perhaps any reason, for the option; after all, she evidently misunderstood what property it was to cover."947  Moreover, there is nothing on the face of the option agreement itself that would lead one to question its purpose948 -- it is a straightforward option agreement that makes good economic sense standing alone.  The small amount of time reflected in her time records, combined with the innocuous nature of the document itself and the error in the legal description, all support the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton knew very little, if anything, at the time she prepared the option about the agreement between Ward and Madison Guaranty concerning the original IDC acquisition six months earlier -- a conclusion that is wholly consistent with the fact that she does not remember anything about the matter now, over ten years later.
     <P>The reason for the option agreement may never be established definitively.  It is not necessary to establish the purpose of the agreement to come to a conclusion about Mrs. Clinton's role in the matter, however.  The evidence collected by the Special Committee, including Denton's recent recollections of a brief discussion with Mrs. Clinton about Ward's loans, does not indicate that Mrs. Clinton knew anything about the arrangement between Ward and McDougal for the IDC purchase, which had closed six months earlier.  The evidence indicates that Mrs. Clinton did very little work on the option, did not know its purpose, and was not privy to any "straw man" arrangement between Ward and McDougal (if indeed that was such an arrangement,* a charge Ward vigorously disputes).
<P> b.  The Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton Played No Role in the Resales of IDC Parcels<P>        that Federal Regulators Have Called "Sham Transactions"

<P>Between the closing of the IDC transaction on October 4, 1985, and March 1986, most of the IDC commercial property that Ward had purchased was resold in a series of six transactions that apparently were orchestrated* by James McDougal.949  In 1996 the Committee reviewed these transactions at public hearings on January 30, January 31, and February 7.  In summary, those transactions were as follows:
<P>1.<P>The October 25, 1985 sale of 6.6 acres and an industrial warehouse leased to Levis Strauss & Co. to Davis Fitzhugh for $500,000 (the loan amount was $525,000, of which $25,000 purportedly was to be used to establish a building maintenance account.950

<P>2.The October 25, 1985 sale of 35 acres of commercial property to Jim Guy Tucker for $125,000 (the loan amount was $260,000, of which $135,000 purportedly was to be used for a feasibility study on the property).951 

<P>3.The November 20, 1985 sale of 9 acres of commercial property to Larry Kuca for $120,000.952

<P>4.The January 20, 1986 sale of 486 acres of the IDC commercial property to former United States Senator J. William Fulbright for $777,600.953

<P>5.The February 14, 1986 sale of the IDC water and sewer facilities to Castle Water & Sewer, Inc. (a corporation formed by Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph) for $1.2 million.954

<P>6.The March 11, 1986 sale of 59 acres of industrial property to Master Developers, Inc. (a corporation formed by R.D. Randolph, James Henley, and David Henley; the Henleys were Susan McDougal's brothers) for $472,000.955

<P>These transactions also were analyzed in detail by Pillsbury Madison & Sutro in their report entitled, "A Report on Certain Real Estate Loans and Investments made by Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Related Entities," which was submitted to the Resolution Trust Corporation on December 19, 1995.  On four of the six transactions described above (all but the Fulbright and Kuca transactions) Madison Guaranty suffered losses when the borrowers failed to repay their loans.956  (The only losses attributable to the Fulbright and Kuca transactions were real estate commissions of $77,600 and $12,000, respectively, paid to Susan McDougal on the two transactions.)957  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro concluded that "[o]f these transactions, all but the Fulbright transaction appear to be suspect,"958 and reported that the total losses* to Madison Guaranty relating to the IDC transactions was $3,809,581.93 in unpaid principal and interest.959 <P>As noted above, on January 4, 1996, additional Rose Law Firm billing records for legal services provided to Madison Guaranty were located in the White House.  Those records were provided to the Special Committee960 and Pillsbury Madison & Sutro961 on January 5, 1996.  In addition to records of work done in connection with the initial IDC purchase, the billing records contain attorney time entries describing work that the Rose Law Firm did for Madison Guaranty during the time that the IDC transactions described above were taking place.  None of those time entries refer are for work on any of the IDC transactions listed above.
<P>On February 25, 1996, after analyzing the Rose Law Firm billing records, collecting additional relevant information, and interviewing Mrs. Clinton, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro concluded:
<P>For the reasons set forth in the [December 19, 1995] Real Estate Report, a number of the sales of IDC parcels to McDougal's friends appear to have been sham transactions designed to create the illusion of profits.  There is no evidence, however, that the Rose Law Firm had anything to do with these sales; in essence, the evidence suggests that these transactions were put together by McDougal and others at Madison Guaranty, on occasion with the cooperation of others such as David Hale, Dean Paul and Jim Guy Tucker.962 
<P>The Special Committee's investigation confirmed the conclusion of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro that the Rose Law Firm had nothing to do with these allegedly fraudulent transactions.   Davis Fitzhugh was a vice president at Madison Financial in 1985 when he purchased the Levi Strauss warehouse property.963  Fitzhugh testified that no attorneys were involved in the purchase of the property and that he drafted the non-recourse language in the loan agreement himself.964  Rose Law Firm attorneys Thomas Thrash and Richard Donovan testified that they did not do any work on the IDC transactions described above.965  Although the Special Committee could not take testimony from all of the parties involved in these transactions, due in part to objections raised by the Independent Counsel with respect to obtaining testimony of certain witnesses, the testimony and documents obtained by the Special Committee support the conclusion that the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton had no involvement in any of the allegedly fraudulent real estate transactions. 
 <P>     4.  The Rose Law Firm's Work for Madison Guaranty on IDC Matters Was
<P>  Legitimate, Well-Documented, and Appropriately Billed
<P> a.  Introduction
<P>Although the Rose Law Firm did not do any legal work on the sales of IDC parcels described above, the firm did provide legal services to Madison Guaranty on other matters relating to the development of the IDC commercial property.  James McDougal reportedly planned to develop the commercial IDC property north of 145th Street through various projects, including a motel, a brewery, a convenience store, a gas station, a dance hall, a restaurant, and a sporting goods store.966  These development efforts would complement McDougal's plans for the property south of 145th Street, where he intended to develop and sell residential lots.  In connection with McDougal's plans for the development of the commercial portions of the IDC property, Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm were asked to research and analyze two legal issues.  One project was to determine whether a brewery could be licensed in a "dry" township after that township had been incorporated into a larger "wet" township.  The other project was to determine whether the existing sewer and water facilities on the IDC property could be extended to provide utility services to areas outside of the property.  
<P>The Rose Law Firm became involved in the liquor license and utility issues when Ward asked the law firm to conduct some legal research on those issues.967  Ward, who was overseeing the development of the IDC property for Madison Guaranty, dealt with Mrs. Clinton on these issues.  Mrs. Clinton has testified that it was her "understanding that [Ward] was in some manner employed by Madison to help them develop property around Little Rock."968  Moreover, Mrs. Clinton has stated that she dealt exclusively with Ward as opposed to Latham or McDougal:
<P><P>Well, in most of my dealings in the last months preceding this on behalf of Madison, I dealt with Mr. Ward.  He was the person I dealt with on the brewery issue.  He was the person that we dealt with on the utility issue.  He was Madison as far as I was concerned.969
<P>
Ward does not recall the circumstances of the Rose Law Firm's retention, but has confirmed that he must have been working with Mrs. Clinton on the liquor license issue, "I must have, because she gave me [Donovan's memorandum], . . . And I had forgotten it, and I still don't remember getting it, but I must have, And I passed it on to -- and if I did, I passed it on to Jim McDougal."970
<P> b.  The Liquor License Issue
<P>The liquor license research resulted from a business proposal that McDougal presented to William Lyon, an Arkansas businessman whose business interests included banking, construction, and lumber sales.  Lyon and McDougal had been acquaintances in college, and Lyon testified that McDougal was a "wheeler-dealer" who had often offered Lyon business opportunities.971  One of those opportunities was a proposal by McDougal that Lyon operate a brewery on the IDC property.  
<P>At the time of McDougal's proposal, Lyon owned and operated a small microbrewery in Little Rock.972  Lyon built the brewery with a $100,000 loan from Madison Guaranty.973  As he expanded the operation, Lyon obtained additional financing from McDougal and Madison Guaranty.  Throughout the course of the brewery's existence, Lyon borrowed approximately $360,000 from Madison Guaranty.974  McDougal's familiarity with the microbrewery operation apparently led him to approach Lyon with a proposal to move the operation to the IDC property.975 
<P>Lyon recalls that in the fall of 1985 McDougal approached him about operating a microbrewery and brew pub on the IDC property south of Little Rock.976  McDougal suggested that Lyon could buy a warehouse located at IDC and move his brewery there from Little Rock.  Lyon testified that he was not particularly interested in McDougal's brewery proposal, but felt he had to indulge McDougal because he owed Madison Guaranty so much money on the brewery loans.977  
<P>The warehouse was on the commercial portion of the IDC property north of 145th Street that Seth Ward had bought in October and optioned to Madison Financial Corporation (discussed above).  On November 20, 1985, Jim McDougal wrote a memorandum to Seth Ward indicating the progress of sales on the IDC parcels that Ward had purchased and optioned to Madison Financial.978  McDougal stated in the memorandum that "[Bill Lyon,] subject to approval by the ABC, . . . will place his brewery in the shell building, along with a tasting room."979  Ward testified that he never took McDougal's idea for a brewery on the IDC property seriously, but he did visit Lyon's microbrewery in Little Rock and arrange for Lyon to see the IDC property.980  
<P>Lyon toured the warehouse with Ward and contacted the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (the "ABC") about moving his brewery to the IDC property.981  When he contacted the ABC, Lyon was told that the IDC property was in a "dry county" where alcoholic beverages could not be sold.982  Lyon testified that when he advised McDougal that the county was dry, McDougal said he could "take care of it."983   Lyon recalls that McDougal said he would speak with Governor Clinton and would pursue regulatory relief from the state authorities.984  <P>As noted above, McDougal's November 20, 1985 memorandum to Ward indicates that McDougal had recognized the necessity of obtaining ABC approval for the brewery project.  The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that on November 26, 1986, Mrs. Clinton had a conference with Ward, followed by conferences with her partners Thomas Thrash and Webster Hubbell.985  Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Thrash nor Hubbell can remember now, almost ten years later, whether these conferences related to the brewery proposal.  Other evidence collected by the Special Committee, however, suggests that may have been the case.
<P>Mrs. Clinton had a number of telephone conferences with Ward in December.986  On December 20 Mrs. Clinton's time records indicate that after a telephone conversation with Ward she searched for a map.987  The time entry for December 23 appears incomplete, perhaps due to a typing error, but it seems to indicate that Mrs. Clinton visited Ward's office.988  Mrs. Clinton recalls that she did some preliminary research before meeting with Ward on the liquor license issue.989  After another telephone conference with Ward on December 24, Mrs. Clinton apparently enlisted the assistance of a Rose Law Firm associate to research the issue.
<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that on December 30 Richard Donovan, then a young associate, began researching "local option election records."990  On December 31 Donovan billed time for a "conference with ABC regarding wet/dry precincts" and further research on local option law.991  On January 2 Donovan billed three hours completing his research and drafting a memorandum.  On January 3 he revised the memorandum.
<P>Donovan's memorandum is dated January 3, 1986, and is addressed to Mrs. Clinton.  The memorandum analyzes whether or not the location for the proposed brewery at IDC* was within a "dry" or "wet" county.992  Specifically, the memorandum considers whether a smaller "dry" township (where the property at issue was located) retains its "dry" status or becomes "wet" when it is incorporated into a larger "wet" township.993  Donovan found that there was "no Arkansas law on point,"994but concluded based on law from other jurisdictions that "the smaller township would retain its dry status" when incorporated into a wet township until otherwise changed by an election.995  Donovan's memorandum also notes that in a minority of jurisdictions the "smaller township would lose its dry status" when incorporated into a larger "wet" township.996  His memorandum concluded: "It would seem the only chance for successfully building the brewery would be to convince the ABC the site is not within the old Union Township or convince the ABC and ultimately the courts that Arkansas should adopt the minority position that when `wet' and `dry' areas are joined, the resulting entity becomes all `wet'."997  <P>After receiving Donovan's memorandum Mrs. Clinton apparently then met with Ward and gave him a copy of the memorandum.998  Mrs. Clinton's time records show a conference with Ward on January 7.999   Ward seems to have asked for further analysis of the issue.1000  The billing records show that Donovan and Mrs. Clinton met on January 14 regarding further "fact investigation."1001  On January 15 Donovan had another telephone conversation with the state election commission and county clerk "regarding what happened to old Union Township."1002  Then, on January 16, 1986, he asked Rose Law Firm paralegal Becky Arnold to research County Clerk's Office "records from 1953 until the present time and try to locate the record of the County Court's action in dissolving, merging, or rezoning the Old Union Township."1003  On January 19 and 22 Donovan researched the "effect of township dissolution on `wet/dry' status" and drafted another memorandum.1004  <P>
<P>In his second memorandum, dated January 23, 1986, Donovan advised Mrs. Clinton that "the overwhelming majority of cases hold that the consolidation, dissolution or merger of a given entity which had voted "wet or dry" pursuant to a local option election retains its "wet or dry" status even though it is incorporated into a "wet" political/geographic entity."1005  Donovan then outlined two alternative strategies that might be employed to gain approval for a brewery on the IDC property: 1) file an application with the ABC Board and if denied attempt to "convince the Board to adopt the minority rule"; or 2) "obtain signatures to place the `wet dry' issue on the ballot" and hope that the old Union Township's "dry" status could be changed to "wet" by popular vote.1006  
<P>Despite Donovan's diligent efforts to find a solution that would permit the brewery operation to be licensed, the client apparently decided not to try to overcome the legal obstacles.  McDougal forwarded Donovan's January 23 memorandum to Jim Guy Tucker* on February 7, 1986 with a note stating "It looks like our township is dry."1007  Although the Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that Becky Arnold did some additional research in February1008 and March1009 regarding the "old Union Township boundaries," there is no evidence that the Rose Law Firm or McDougal ever contacted the Governor's office or took any other steps to try to change the "dry" status of the property.
<P> c.  The Utility Service Issue
<P>With respect to the utility service research, Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that on February 11, 1986 Donovan began researching public utility law issues and "supplying of water" by the IDC water system.1010  On February 12 and 13 he continued his research, spoke with the state Public Service Commission legal staff, and began drafting a legal memorandum.1011  The Rose Law Firm records show that on February 16, 1986, Donovan revised a memorandum "regarding public utility issues."1012  On February 17, 1986, Donovan provided a memorandum to Mrs. Clinton addressing whether Madison Guaranty could "become a public utility" and whether Madison Guaranty could "sell water to a business outside the IDC Development* and to another real estate development [Maple Creek]."1013  Donovan found that in order to operate a public utility, Madison Guaranty would have to "submit itself to the jurisdiction of the [Arkansas Public Service Commission]" and "obtain licenses and permits" from the Arkansas Board of Health and the Arkansas Pollution Control System.1014  Donovan's memorandum concluded that under relevant Arkansas legal authorities, "[a]ssuming an expansion of water and sewer services to customers outside the IDC Development does not impede or impair services to present patrons, Madison Guaranty/IDC is free to extend it services beyond the IDC Development."1015
<P>On March 4, 1986, Donovan prepared a follow-up memorandum to Mrs. Clinton on the water and sewer service expansion issue.1016  That memorandum analyzed whether "the fact that Madison Guaranty/IDC's potential water customers are within the Little Rock corporate city limits preclude the extension of services to those customers by Madison Guaranty IDC."1017  The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that in researching this issue Donovan made telephone calls to legal staff at the Public Service Commission and manager at the Little Rock Water Works.1018  Donovan also did additional research to verify the legality of the proposed expansion of utility services.  Donovan concluded, "Not only is there no state statute or city ordinance which would preclude such an extension of Madison/IDC's water services, but the common law general rule is that a municipality has no authority to enact an ordinance or to require persons within its territorial limits to use municipally supplied water to the exclusion of a privately owned system."1019
<P> d.  Conclusions
<P>Pillsbury Madison & Sutro observed that "[n]o theory has been advanced that the [liquor license and utility research by the Rose Law Firm] aided any sort of wrongdoing."1020  The evidence obtained by the Special Committee is consistent with that conclusion.  The evidence indicates that Madison Guaranty needed legal counsel on two relatively routine legal issues relating to the development of the IDC commercial properties.  The Rose Law Firm was asked to research the regulatory limitations that might apply to constructing a brewery on the IDC property and expanding a sewer and water utility outside of the IDC complex.  These were technical legal issues requiring analysis and interpretation of Arkansas laws and regulations, and it is not surprising that Madison Guaranty would have looked to an outside law firm for assistance.1021  Mrs. Clinton, recalls that she "conducted research and explored possible issues pertaining to [the brewery and utility matters], both on my own and in partnership with Mr. Donovan."1022  The Rose Law Firm billing records confirm Mrs. Clinton's recollection of her involvement in these matters.  All of the research memoranda on these matters were addressed to Mrs. Clinton.  Finally, internal Madison Guaranty documents, such as the note from McDougal to Tucker discussed above,1023 confirm Mrs. Clinton's work on these matters.  
<P>With respect to the liquor license issue, Lyon testified that he had no reason to believe that anyone in the Governor's office ever interceded on his behalf in the brewery matter.1024  Both Donovan and Thrash testified that the work the Rose Law Firm did for Madison Guaranty were straightforward legal matters, and they were never asked to do anything improper in connection with these matters.1025  In the end, Lyon never pursued the construction of the brewery in the IDC property.  The Rose Law Firm never filed a petition with the ABC to obtain approval for a brewery.  Thus there is no suggestion that Mrs. Clinton or anyone else at the Rose Law Firm ever sought to influence any state officials on behalf of Madison Guaranty.<P>
<P>The Rose Law Firm billing statements show that Mrs. Clinton first recorded time on IDC matters on November 14, 1985, for a telephone conference with Seth Ward.1026  Mrs. Clinton has stated that because of the technical subject matter, she conducted some preliminary research on the issues.1027  Mrs. Clinton has also testified that as a client, Ward could be quite demanding.  As noted above, it appears that in both cases, after Mrs. Clinton reported to Ward, he asked that further legal work be done.  After Mrs. Clinton spoke with Ward, Donovan did follow-up memoranda on both the liquor license and utility service issues.  Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton has stated that in order to adequately address Ward's concerns, "I believe I would have had to conduct additional research in order to satisfy Mr. Ward that [Donovan's] initial memo was legally correct and discussed with him possible avenues that could be pursued despite the legal research."1028 
<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that in the January 1986 billing statement Mrs. Clinton's billings were adjusted, with the charge for Mrs. Clinton's time increased from $912.50 to $2,731.75.1029  At Mrs. Clinton's hourly billing rate of $125.00, this adjustment represents an addition of approximately 14.5 hours.  The Special Committee reviewed whether these additional 14.5 hours might represent billings for work during the September-October period in 1985 when the agreement was reached between Ward and McDougal for Ward to purchase a portion of the IDC property and option it to Madison Financial (the alleged "straw buyer" arrangement discussed above).  The Special Committee's investigation has established that the adjustment to Mrs. Clinton's billings did not relate to work in the fall of 1985. 
<P>Ron Clark, Rose Law Firm's chief operating officer, testified that if Mrs. Clinton would have "[billed these hours] in September or October they would have been included on the September and October internal bills that were rendered, but that's not necessary to the case.... I would think that since the extra hours were on the January bill, it would have been time that she would have spent sometime after October 29th, which was the next previous bill."1030   Moreover, Mrs. Clinton has stated that the reason for the adjustment was an effort by the Rose Law Firm to bill clients for all services provided prior to January 31, the end of the firm's fiscal year, and "a tremendous effort was made to bill, not only all matters and hours that had already been recorded in the computer, but any work in progress as well to try to clear the decks before the end of the fiscal year."1031  Mrs. Clinton explained that the adjustment to her billings was for "work in progress" that had not yet been entered into the computer when the January 1986 statement was prepared.1032  Clark confirmed Mrs. Clinton's explanation:

<P><P>"If you will notice, I mean the date of the billing memorandum is dated January 21; of course, the date of the bill is only January 30th.  And it looks like the last time entry was January 15th and Mrs. Clinton's last time entry was January 7.  So I would anticipate at the time of preparing the bill there had been additional time rendered since the last date of the last bill which was added to this.  This is especially true at this time of the year which is the end of our fiscal year: especially in these years, our accounting department was very backed up because they were generating the bills that were putting the timekeeping in.  So typically we would have to manually add time during the last months of the year to properly reflect our bills."1033
<P>Finally, it should be noted that some confusion has arisen as to whether the entire property purchased from IDC was known as "Castle Grande."  This issue arose because prior to the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records, Mrs. Clinton had stated that she did not do any work on Castle Grande.1034  The Rose Law Firm billing records show that she did some work on IDC matters, as discussed above.  The documents and testimony provided to the Special Committee clearly indicate that within the Rose Law Firm, the work was known as the IDC matter.*  Although with the passage of time the entire property has sometimes been referred to as Castle Grande,* the evidence collected by the Special Committee established that during the relevant time period -- in 1985 and 1986 when the Rose Law Firm was providing legal services to Madison Guaranty -- only the portion of the IDC property south of 145th Street was called Castle Grande.1035  That was the name James McDougal gave to the residential development he started on that portion of the IDC property.1036  John Latham testified that the residential area which was named Castle Grande was "really a small part of" the IDC property.1037  The projects Mrs. Clinton worked on were related to the other, commercial, portions of the IDC tract, and did not involve the Castle Grande residential development.  Thus Mrs. Clinton's prior statement that she did not work on Castle Grande is consistent with the evidence obtained by the Special Committee.

<H3>  J.  DAVID HALE'S FALSE ALLEGATION AGAINST GOVERNOR CLINTON</H3>

<P>1.  Introduction

<P>David Hale is the only witness who has claimed that as Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton participated in discussions of financial transactions concerning Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association and Capital Management Services, Inc.  Hale, a twice convicted felon and an admitted liar and perjurer, has claimed that on three occasions in late 1985 and early 1986 Governor Clinton spoke with him about an illegal $300,000 loan Hale was considering making to Susan McDougal.  
<P>Mr. Clinton has denied ever speaking with Hale about a loan to Susan McDougal.  No document or witness before the Special Committee has corroborated Hale's assertion in any way.
<P>Hale's allegation concerning Governor Clinton, as unreliable as it is, pales in comparison with the exaggerated versions of Hale's statements published, uncritically, in the nearly three years since Hale first surfaced.  Ever since operatives of Citizens United, the ultra-conservative anti-Clinton group responsible for the 1988 Willie Horton television advertisement, first introduced Hale to the national media in 1993, the press has consistently reported Hale's story as an allegation that Governor Clinton "pressured" Hale to make the loan to Susan McDougal.  It was not until the recently concluded Tucker/McDougal trial -- at which the prosecution was required to disclose Hale's prior interviews with law enforcement officials and the television networks were required to produce "out-takes" of Hale's 1993 interviews with NBC, CNN and ABC -- that the Committee learned what Hale actually told the government and the media about the Susan McDougal loan.  These materials provided important evidence in direct conflict with the exaggerated "pressure" story. 
<P>The jurors in the Tucker/McDougal trial, at which Hale and President Clinton both testified, made clear after the trial that they rejected Hale's unsubstantiated claim about Governor Clinton.  One juror, Colin Capp, stated that the jurors considered Hale "an unmitigated liar ... [who] perjured himself. ... David Hale invoked the President's name for one reason: to save his butt.  We all thought that way."1038  Another juror, Earnest Williams, agreed, adding, "I didn't believe a thing Hale said."1039  
<P>In stark contrast, the jurors stated after the trial that they believed President Clinton when he denied having spoken with Hale about the loan Hale made to Susan McDougal.  Sandra Wood, the jury foreperson, told the press, "The President's credibility was never an issue.  I just felt like he was telling us to the best of his knowledge what he knew."1040  Juror Tracy Pleasants added, "I just felt as though he [President Clinton] was telling the truth, and I wasn't so sure about David Hale."1041
<P>Even Ray Jahn, the lead prosecutor in the case who presented Hale's plea-bargained testimony at the trial on behalf of the Office of the Independent Counsel, backed away from Hale's unsupported assertion about Governor Clinton.  In his closing argument, Jahn told the jury that no one, including Hale, had alleged wrongdoing by Governor Clinton.1042  The lead prosecutor told the jury what anyone who had taken the trouble to review the actual testimony (rather than the hype) already knew -- that there was no evidence presented at the trial, including Hale's testimony, that anyone pressured Hale to make the loan to Susan McDougal or her company, Master Marketing.1043
<P>Hale refused to testify before the Special Committee without a grant of blanket use immunity.  Fortunately, the Special Committee has in its record an abundance of evidence, including 1600 pages of transcript covering nine days of Hale's testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial, that sheds considerable light on Hale's veracity.  Consistent with the view expressed by the jurors, the evidence in the Committee's record compels the conclusion that Hale's unsupported allegation regarding Governor Clinton is false.  
<P>2.   Hale's Personal Circumstances Changed Dramatically In 1993 When He
   Learned That Law Enforcement Officials Had Detected His Criminal
   Conduct And Were About To Indict Him For Numerous Felonies

<P>Hale first spoke with law enforcement officials about his company's $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal on October 10, 1989, when the FBI interviewed him as part of its criminal investigation into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.  At the time of Hale's FBI interview in October 1989, Hale's own criminal conduct had not yet attracted the attention of law enforcement officials, and Hale was not a suspect of any criminal investigation.
<P>Hale described for the FBI how he came to make the $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal back in 1986.  FBI Special Agent Gary A. Aaron memorialized Hale's statements as follows, in a formal interview report (Form FD-302) prepared after the interview:
<P>Hale stated that he recalled making a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, doing business as Master Marketing.  He had been dealing with Jim McDougal previously on some items and recalled telling Jim McDougal that he had some money he wanted to lend.  Hale offered to lend McDougal some as a tie-in with some of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan ventures.  Hale recalled that later on McDougal mentioned to him that his wife, Susan, needed some money for a business.  He recalled having an additional discussion with Jim McDougal regarding this in February, 1986.  In March, 1986, Susan brought some documents to his office which included the personal financial statement of Jim and Susan McDougal, and the financial statement of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.  Susan told Hale that she was going to use the money to promote Madison Guaranty and some new land development.  She offered Hale a mortgage on some property which was located near Castle Grande.  The McDougals personally guaranteed this loan.  Hale stated that he declined the mortgage which Susan offered on the property because SBA viewed this type of thing more favorably when it is made on an unsecured basis.  Hale stated that the loan he made Susan was for five years and the loan currently is in default.1044

<P>Thus, at a time when he was not in any criminal trouble himself, Hale described the $300,000 Master Marketing loan in extensive detail for the FBI without making any mention of any involvement by Bill Clinton.  Contrary to his plea-bargained testimony several years later, Hale said nothing to the FBI in 1989 about any discussions or meetings with Governor Clinton, and he said nothing about Governor Clinton or anyone else encouraging or pressuring him to make the loan.  Instead, Hale told the FBI in 1989 that he and the McDougals worked out the deal and that he was the one who initiated the conversations about the loan because "he had some money he wanted to lend."1045<P>
<P>However, Hale's personal circumstances changed dramatically in 1993.  On May 5 of that year, the Small Business Administration notified Hale that it had referred him and his Small Business Investment Company, Capital Management Services, Inc., to the agency's Inspector General for an investigation of alleged fraud.1046  Shortly thereafter, the Small Business Administration referred the matter to the FBI in Little Rock and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.1047  On July 21, 1993, the FBI executed a federal court search warrant at Hale's offices in Little Rock and seized a large number of incriminating documents.1048  <P>Hale retained Little Rock lawyer Richard Mays shortly after the FBI raid on his offices.1049  Mays met once with officials of the United States Attorney's Office to determine whether he would be able to resolve the case quickly and easily for Hale.1050  When Mays learned that the case was very serious and not likely to be easily resolved, he withdrew from the representation.1051  
<P>Hale then hired a criminal defense lawyer named Randy Coleman, whose law partner had served as campaign finance chairman for Sheffield Nelson, the Republican gubernatorial nominee Governor Clinton had defeated in 1990.1052  Coleman quickly learned from prosecutors that Hale faced imminent indictment in federal court on several felonies involving millions of dollars of fraud against the Small Business Administration and others.1053
<P>3.  Hale Tried To Extract An Offer Of Blanket Immunity From Federal
   Prosecutors By Offering To Provide Undefined Information About
   High-Ranking Arkansas Politicians

<P>Facing many years in prison, millions of dollars in fines, and the loss of his law license and municipal court judgeship, Hale authorized Coleman to seek a plea agreement with Paula Casey, the United States Attorney in Little Rock.  Coleman met with Casey in early September 1993 and demanded that Casey either give Hale blanket immunity from prosecution or allow Hale to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor offense in exchange for Hale's provision of undefined information about unidentified members of the "Arkansas political elite."1054  Coleman testified that he sought this extraordinarily lenient deal from Casey, despite the seriousness of Hale's crimes, to enable Hale to retain his law license and continue serving as a municipal court judge in Little Rock.1055
<P>Casey told Coleman that she was interested in receiving whatever information Hale had to offer.1056  But Casey made clear that Hale would have to provide the FBI with a factual proffer of his information before any plea agreement could be struck, and that any such agreement would have to include a guilty plea to a felony offense.1057  Assistant United States Attorney Michael Johnson, a career federal prosecutor in Casey's office with 22 years' experience, testified that it is common practice "when dealing with potential defendants who seek leniency in exchange for information to demand and obtain from them a proffer, that is, a preview of the evidence they have to offer before agreeing to the arrangement."1058  As several career Department of Justice prosecutors testified, Casey would have risked "buying a pig in a poke" if she had agreed to a plea bargain without first insisting on a factual proffer from Hale, because without a proffer Casey would have had no way of determining whether Hale's information would be useful to the government.1059  
<P>Johnson added that a proffer would have allowed the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office "to assess and corroborate the information, and to make the determination whether to enter into a plea arrangement whereby Mr. Hale would receive leniency in exchange for the information and testimony.  It was standard Department of Justice operating procedure."1060  Special Agent Steve Irons, the lead financial fraud investigator in the FBI's Little Rock field office in 1993, and later a senior agent detailed to the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, agreed with Johnson: "Usually, it's just that you come in and tell us, and we'll decide after that."1061
<P>Rather than make a proffer, however, Hale chose to contact Jim Johnson, a pro-segregationist retired Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and one of President Clinton's most ardent and vociferous political opponents.1062  Records indicate that Hale made more than forty telephone calls to Justice Johnson's office in the period following the July 21, 1993 FBI raid on Hale's offices.1063  With Johnson's assistance, Hale and his lawyer also soon were in touch with Floyd Brown and David Bossie, the two leading anti-Clinton operatives of Citizens United.1064
<P>Hale then went to the media.  While still refusing to provide his purported information to law enforcement officials, Hale first appeared on Floyd Brown's radio show1065 and then gave lengthy interviews to several national television networks and to The New York Times and The Washington Post.1066  
<P>David Bossie of Citizens United was present throughout an on-camera interview Hale gave to NBC on November 4, 1993 at Coleman's law office.  As established by the testimony of Joseph (Mike) Narisi, the cameraman who filmed the interview for NBC, Bossie prompted Hale's answers during the interview:
<P>Bossie greeted employees of the office by their first names and appeared to be well-acquainted with Coleman and the employees at Coleman's law office.  Bossie consulted with Hale and Coleman before the taping of the interview began, was present throughout the interview, and prompted Hale during the videotaping of the interview.1067
<P>Assistant United States Attorney Johnson testified that Coleman and Hale were "manipulating public perception, in part through the news media, in an effort to scare [the United States Attorney's Office] into capitulating" regarding Hale's indictment.1068  John Keeney, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice and a career prosecutor with almost 50 years' experience, testified that it was "totally inappropriate" for Coleman and Hale to use the press to pressure the prosecutors into agreeing to any particular plea deal.1069
<P>One example of Hale's use of the media to manipulate the public's perception was a statement Hale made during his November 4, 1993 interview with NBC.  "Out-takes" of the interview indicate that when asked about the status of his plea negotiations with the United States Attorney's Office Hale stated that the prosecutors had told him: "We are not interested [in your information].  We want you to come over here and plead guilty and shut up."1070  This, of course, was a false and grossly misleading statement of the position of the United States Attorney, who had told Hale and his lawyer repeatedly, as had her assistants and FBI Special Agent Irons, that she wanted to receive a detailed proffer of whatever information Hale had to provide.1071
<P>Hale's lawyer also sought to manipulate the White House during this time period.  Coleman contacted William Kennedy, an attorney in the White House Counsel's Office, and told him that he had a client facing federal criminal prosecution who was considering offering incriminating information about President Clinton.1072  Coleman testified that he contacted Kennedy because he hoped that the White House would misuse the information and do something "foolish" with respect to the federal government's investigation of Hale.1073  As discussed elsewhere in this report, the evidence established that no one at the White House or anywhere else in the Clinton Administration made any effort to silence Hale by interfering with his prosecution.
<P>Despite Hale's extraordinary efforts to coerce an unreasonably lenient plea agreement from the United States Attorney's Office, a federal grand jury in Little Rock issued a four-count indictment against Hale on September 23, 1993.  
<P>Donald MacKay, a career prosecutor in the Justice Department's Fraud Section, took over the prosecution of Hale on November 8, 1993, following the recusal of Paula Casey and the United States Attorney's Office in Little Rock.1074  MacKay and the career prosecutors working with him at the Department of Justice took the same position with regard to Hale's plea demands that Casey had taken.  Mackay informed Coleman that he would not reach a plea bargain with Hale until Hale had informed law enforcement officials what information he could provide in exchange for the agreement.1075  
<P>Hale continued his refusal to make a proffer to law enforcement officials absent an advance promise of blanket immunity or the dismissal of charges.1076  Instead, Hale repeated his unsubstantiated allegation about Governor Clinton in the media, in a continuing effort to manipulate public opinion.1077


<P>4.  Hale Eventually Reached A Plea Bargain With The Independent Counsel
  That Required Him To Plead Guilty To Two Felonies
<P>Hale finally agreed on March 19, 1994, following the appointment of an Independent Counsel, to plead guilty to two felonies -- a harsher plea agreement than that upon which Paula Casey and the career Justice Department officials had insisted.1078  Assistant United States Attorney Michael Johnson testified:
<P>The United States Attorney's Office offered Mr. Hale a plea agreement which would have required him to plead guilty to a single felony.  He rejected that and insisted on receiving immunity, or at most, pleading to a misdemeanor offense.  This issue was ultimately resolved between Mr. Hale and the Independent Counsel's Office when Mr. Hale pled guilty to two felony offenses, not one.1079
<P>Although Hale faced the possibility of a longer period of incarceration under his plea bargain with the Independent Counsel than he would have faced under the plea required by Paula Casey, Hale's deal with the Independent Counsel nevertheless was generous to Hale in other respects.  In exchange for Hale's guilty pleas to two felonies, the Independent Counsel gave Hale a broad transactional immunity from prosecution "for any crimes related to his participation in the conduct of the affairs of Capital Management Services, Inc., Diversified Capital, Inc., and Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, and any other crimes, to the extent David L. Hale has disclosed such criminal activity to this Office as of the date of this Agreement."1080  In addition, the Independent Counsel promised that, if Hale continued to provide substantial assistance to the prosecution, he would file a motion asking the judge to exempt Hale from application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and to show leniency for Hale at the time of sentencing.1081  
<P>Hale entered his two felony guilty pleas on March 22, 1994 before United States District Court Judge Stephen M. Reasoner.  Judge Reasoner placed Hale under oath at the hearing and cautioned him to tell the truth:
<P>THE COURT:  Now, Mr. Hale, since you are now under oath let me caution you if you were to make any false statement to me during these proceedings this morning that could be used against you in later proceedings for perjury or false statement.1082

<P>Hale then told the court, under oath, that he did not benefit personally from any of the fraudulent loan schemes to which he was pleading guilty:
<P>THE COURT:  What happened to the money you obtained from the SBA by this plan?
<P><P>
<P>MR. HALE:  It was loaned to various entities.
<P><P>
<P>THE COURT:  That's what I was asking.  Who was it loaned to?
<P><P><P>
<P>MR. HALE:  I can't recall right off, Your Honor.  I'm sorry, I can't recall that.
<P><P><P>
<P>THE COURT:  Were any of the entities that you had an interest in?
<P><P><P>
<P>MR. HALE:  I don't believe so.1083
<P>Two years later, after having received a reduced sentence from Judge Reasoner, Hale admitted on cross-examination at the Tucker/McDougal trial that he had benefitted personally from the fraudulent loan schemes to which he pled guilty and that he had misled Judge Reasoner, under oath:
<P>Q.  And what you said to Judge Reasoner when you were pleading guilty was not true, was it?
<P><P><P>
<P>A.  Like I said when he asked me, I did not know I was going to have to say anything, and when you are standing up there, I was scared to death and I don't even recall what I said except it's recorded.
<P><P><P>
<P>Q.  Do you lie when you are scared?
<P><P><P>
<P>A.  No, but I was scared and I don't remember what I said.  
<P><P><P>
<P>Q.  Well, you were talking, though, to the judge.
<P><P><P>
<P>A.  Yes, sir, I was.
<P><P><P>
<P>Q.  Mr. Hale --
<P><P><P>
<P>A.  And I would not under any circumstances want to mislead the judge at all.
<P><P><P>
<P>Q.  Yeah, but you did.
<P><P><P>
<P>A.  If that's what I said, I did.1084
<P>In fact, Hale and companies he owned benefitted significantly -- in the amount of at least $500,000 -- from illegal loans made by Capital Management Services, Inc.  For example, Hale received $280,000 from an illegal loan he made through Capital Management Services, Inc. to the Sunbelt Corporation.1085  Similarly, Hale received a $200,000 benefit when Dean Paul released him from a $200,000 mortgage obligation in return for an illegal $200,000 loan Hale made to Paul through Capital Management Services, Inc.1086
<P>On an analogous subject, Hale also admitted at the Tucker/McDougal trial that he has not paid taxes on any of his ill-gotten gains and that he has no intention of paying taxes on the approximately $63,000 in cash payments he has received from the FBI over the past two years.1087  As with Hale's admittedly false sworn testimony, Hale has not been prosecuted for income tax evasion.1088
<P>When Hale finally went before the court for sentencing on March 25, 1996, the Independent Counsel asked the court to grant Hale a downward departure from the amount of prison time otherwise required by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.1089  The court gave Hale a significant break, sentencing him to only 28 months in prison instead of the 46 to 57 months otherwise called for by the guidelines.  The court also sentenced Hale to three years of supervised release, imposed a fine of $10,000, and ordered Hale to pay $2.04 million dollars in restitution to the Small Business Administration.1090
<P>Hale reluctantly admitted on cross-examination at the Tucker/McDougal trial that he hopes to receive yet another reduction in his sentence with the assistance of the Independent Counsel.  Hale admitted that he intends to file a motion for reduction of sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by March 25, 1997 and that he hopes Independent Counsel Starr will support his motion to the sentencing judge.1091
<P>5.  Hale's History of Fraud and Duplicity
<P>The two felonies to which Hale pled guilty each involved serious fraudulent and deceitful conduct on Hale's part.  
<P>Hale's first felony guilty plea was to a conspiracy to defraud the Small Business Administration through the making of false statements concerning the capitalization of his company, Capital Management Services, Inc., and the status of certain loans on its books.1092  One overt act of the conspiracy involved $800,000 Hale fraudulently removed from an innocent woman's account at Prudential-Bache.1093  Specifically, Hale withdrew $800,000 from Louise Townsend's account on November 4, 1988 without Townsend's knowledge or permission.  Hale then used the $800,000 in a series of fraudulent transactions that enabled him to obtain federal matching funds from the SBA by falsely claiming additional capitalization of Capital Management Services, Inc.  Hale described the fraud as follows during his testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial:
<P>[W]e took the $800,000 and put [it] into CMS, and then took the $400,000 to apply for funds from [the] SBA.  I credited $400,000 between Sunbelt, Grasby and eighty-two fifty on MaBe Communications [delinquent loans].  Then I turned around and loaned that money back out to McIntire, LAME and River Valley, and [then the] funds [were] returned to the Townsend account.1094
<P>Hale's second felony guilty plea, also related to the conspiracy to defraud the Small Business Administration, was based on a wide variety of false statements and representations Hale made to the agency between 1985 and 1991.  Hale made these false statements and representations with the specific intent to defraud Capitol Management Services, Inc. and its shareholders and to obtain SBA funds through "false and fraudulent pretenses."1095  
<P>Hale admitted at the Tucker/McDougal trial that in the 1985-1991 time period covered by his guilty plea he submitted to the SBA false reporting forms regarding SBA-backed loans he made to a large number of companies, including Arkansas Commercial Realty Company, Weaver-Bailey, International Trading, Midwest Consulting, Liberty Mortgage, Campobello, Castle Sewer and Water, The Communications Co., Master Marketing, and Paul Sales.1096  Hale testified that he intentionally provided false information to the SBA "so that it wouldn't appear that it was a fraudulent document. ... I did it for the purpose of covering the fraudulent activity that I had done."1097
<P>Hale testified at the Tucker/McDougal trial about a few of the many other fraudulent schemes for which he was excused from prosecution pursuant to his plea bargain with the Independent Counsel.  One such scheme involved the falsification of loan files to deceive the Small Business Administration into believing that bad loans were in good condition.  Hale explained:

<P>If I had a loan that wasn't paid that looked like it might get classified, I would show it on the books being sold to another entity, and that entity would in turn give Capital Management a note.1098
<P>Wayne Foren, the Director of the Office of Economic Development at the Small Business Administration and a career official with sixteen years' experience at the agency,1099 testified that Hale's conduct involving the affairs of Capital Management Services, Inc. was "one of the most blatant cases of fraud in the [Small Business Investment Company] program I have ever seen."1100
<P>The Special Committee also learned about an allegedly fraudulent burial insurance scheme for which Hale still faces a likely state prosecution in Arkansas.  Hale purchased the National Savings Life Insurance Company in 1986.  At the time, National had 43 insurance agents who sold burial insurance to low-income persons in the area of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, a predominantly African-American community south of Little Rock.  For a premium of as little as $1 per month, National committed to pay for a casket and funeral service when a policyholder died.
<P>It has been reported that when National filed its financial statements with the Arkansas Insurance Department in March 1993 the statements showed a capital deficiency, rendering the company insolvent.  Arkansas Insurance Commissioner Lee Douglas directed Hale to cure the capital deficiency, and in July 1993 Hale deposited $150,000 into a company account.1101
<P>It has been reported that in September 1993, a few days before Hale was indicted by the federal grand jury in Little Rock, the president of National notified state insurance regulators that the $150,000 had disappeared.  The Insurance Department sent examiners to conduct a surprise audit, and they found that the $150,000 had been transferred out of National to another company controlled by Hale on the same day in July 1993 on which Hale had put the money into National to cure the capital deficiency.1102  
<P>State insurance regulators seized National as insolvent on September 27, 1993, and in April 1994 Commissioner Douglas referred Hale's alleged looting of the company to Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Stodola for possible prosecution.1103  Stodola has stated publicly, as well as in a letter to Independent Counsel Starr, that he intends to obtain a grand jury indictment against Hale prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations period on July 6, 1996.1104<P>
<P>Abundant evidence demonstrated that Hale defrauded even his friends and business associates.  Dean Paul, for example, a former law client and business associate of Hale's, testified at the Tucker/McDougal trial about Hale's extraordinary abilities as a con man:
<P>Q.  David had been your lawyer?

<P>A.  Yes.

<P>Q.  And you trusted him as a lawyer?

<P>A.  Yes.

<P>Q.  And you trusted him as your lawyer?

<P>A.  As my lawyer.

<P>Q.  And he used that trust to tell you we were going to get us an insurance company, didn't he?

<P>A.  He used that trust.  Yes, he painted that picture, yes.

<P>Q.  David painted pictures well, didn't he?

<P>A.  Yes, he did.

<P>Q.  Is David an eloquent man?

<P>A.  I think he is.  To me he is.

<P>Q.  Does he present a persuasive picture when he talks?

<P>A.  About as good as I've ever seen.

<P>Q.  And he can paint a picture and make you believe it, can't he?

<P>A.  He did me.

<P>...

<P>Q.  Have you been conned before so well?

<P>A.  No.1105

<P>Indeed, it appears that no one drawn into Hale's orbit was safe from his rapacity.  In 1986, Hale learned that his secretary's family was having trouble making mortgage payments on the family farm.  Hale offered his assistance, suggesting that if the farm were deeded over to a company controlled by him the land could be developed and the creditors kept at bay.  At the end of the day, no development took place, foreclosure ensued, and the family lost the farm.  But that was after Hale had helped himself to 133 acres.  
<P>According to news reports, testimony in a subsequent civil suit showed that Hale was having an affair with his secretary at the time and that he persuaded her to convince her family to "just sit and wait."  In 1991, Judge Reasoner entered a $468,496 civil judgment against Hale.  The family's claims against Hale for fraud are still in litigation.1106
<P>Finally, Hale's recent claim that as a cooperating witness he required the security services of federal law enforcement officers to protect him from undisclosed threats must be considered in light of Hale's past behavior as a municipal court judge in Little Rock.  For while Hale was committing all of the aforementioned crimes in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, he also was sitting two or three days per week as a judge hearing traffic and hot-check misdemeanor cases.  <P>During this time, at considerable expense to the taxpayers, Hale had a bulletproof screen installed in front of his bench and a metal detector placed in front of the door to his courtroom.  On one occasion, Hale, claiming that a group of current and former employees were "plotting to kill him," arranged to have a deputy sheriff escort him from the municipal courthouse.  Apparently, one of the "plotters," a former employee of Hale's, was celebrating a girlfriend's birthday at a local restaurant where she confided in a state trooper, "if Hale died I wouldn't cry."  This was the sum and substance of the supposed murder plot.1107
<P>The cost to the federal government of guarding Hale for the two years leading up to the Tucker/McDougal trial (in addition to the $63,000 cash the FBI paid to Hale for living expenses) has not been disclosed.
<P>6.  Hale's Unsubstantiated Assertion About Governor Clinton
<P>It was in the context of his imminent federal indictment, in the fall of 1993, that Hale asserted for the first time, in press interviews, that Governor Clinton had expressed an interest back in late 1985 and early 1986 in Hale's making a $300,000 SBA-backed loan to Susan McDougal.  
<P>Hale told the press of three supposed encounters with Governor Clinton.  Hale claimed that the first encounter occurred in December 1985 outside the State Capitol Building in Little Rock.  According to Hale, Governor Clinton approached Hale outside the building and asked him, "Are [you] going to be able to help us out, help Jim and I (sic) out?"1108  
<P>Hale claimed that the second encounter occurred in late January or early February 1986 at Jim McDougal's office trailer at the Castle Grande Estates.  According to the story Hale told the press, Governor Clinton offered to put up "some land in Marion County" as collateral for the loan but insisted that his "name cannot show up in the documents."1109
<P>Hale claimed that his third encounter with Governor Clinton occurred at the University Mall in Little Rock.  According to Hale, Governor Clinton approached him in the mall and asked, "Have you heard what that blankety blank Susan has done [with the money]?"1110
<P>7.  Hale's Allegation That Governor Clinton Showed Interest In The Master Marketing Loan Is Riddled With Internal Inconsistencies
<P>Hale's unsubstantiated assertion about Governor Clinton's supposed interest in Hale's loan to Susan McDougal is riddled with internal inconsistencies that further discredit it.  A few examples of these inconsistencies follow.
<P>Hale claims that at a meeting at McDougal's office trailer in early 1986 Governor Clinton offered to put up some land in Marion County as collateral for the loan.1111  Hale also claims, however, that at the same meeting Governor Clinton stated repeatedly that his name "cannot show up on this."1112
<P>These two assertions of Hale's cannot stand when viewed together.  It simply does not make sense that Governor Clinton -- a trained lawyer -- would have offered to put up land in his own name as collateral for a loan if he was adamant that his name not be associated with the loan.  Hale was questioned about this internal inconsistency at the Tucker/McDougal trial:
<P>Q. When you own property, that's recorded at the recorder of deeds, isn't it?
<P> 
<P>A. If you put up any property, in order to have title, you must record it.
<P><P><P><P>
<P>Q. All right.  Now, isn't it also true that if Mr. Clinton had owned property, it would have been forever at the recorder of deeds in Marion County, forever?
<P><P> 
<P>A. Not if he sold it.
<P><P> 
<P>Q. If he sold it, the old deed is still there recorded, isn't it?
<P><P> 
<P>A. It is there, but is shows it was taken out of his name and put in somebody else's.
<P><P><P><P>
<P>Q. But it shows, doesn't it?
<P><P> 
<P>A. Yes, sir. 

<P><P>...

<P>Q. Could [anyone] go and find out the sitting governor of Arkansas owned it just before it was conveyed to a Sunbelt type of corporation?
<P><P> 
<P>A. They could have.1113
<P>Also according to Hale, McDougal initially requested a loan of only $150,000 and then later increased his request to $300,000.  Hale claims that he quickly responded "that that would be fine."1114  
<P>Hale's willingness to double the amount of the loan is not consistent with any notion that he needed encouragement from Governor Clinton to convince him to make the loan in the first place.  If Hale truly had been reluctant initially to make the loan, then it is extremely unlikely that he would have agreed so quickly to double the amount.  
<P>  8.  Hale Cannot Keep His Story Straight
<P>Additional inconsistent statements Hale has made about significant aspects of the $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal cast even further doubt on Hale's credibility.  As in the previous section, a few examples will suffice here.
<P>As discussed above, Hale now claims that in early 1986 Governor Clinton offered to put up some land in Marion County as collateral for the loan.  In 1989, however, Hale said nothing in his interview with the FBI about Governor Clinton having any involvement with the loan -- much less about Governor Clinton offering land as collateral.  Instead, Hale told the FBI that Susan McDougal "offered [him] a mortgage on some property which was located near Castle Grande."1115
<P>It is interesting to note that at the Tucker/McDougal trial Hale testified that Governor Clinton referred to the land he supposedly offered as collateral simply as "some property in Marion County."  Hale told the jury that Governor Clinton "didn't say" what property he was referring to and that he "didn't know anything about [the Clintons' investment in] Whitewater" at the time.  "I did not know Whitewater," he said.  "I did not know what they owned up there."1116
<P>However, back in the fall of 1993, as Justice Jim Johnson, Floyd Brown, David Bossie and other anti-Clinton forces were facilitating Hale's access to the national media, Hale told Jeff Gerth of The New York Times that at the 1986 meeting Governor Clinton identified the property in Marion County as "White-something."  As reflected in the notes of Bruce Lindsey and Mark Gearan, Gerth then reported Hale's allegation to them.1117  Hale's inclusion of the term "White-something" in 1993 appears to have been an attempt to pique the interest of the media by fabricating a connection between the Susan McDougal loan and Whitewater.  
<P>Another example of Hale's inconsistent statements about the Master Marketing loan concerns Hale's claimed relationship with Governor Clinton.  Hale testified at the Tucker/McDougal trial that he did not consider himself "a close personal friend of Bill Clinton,"1118 a point clearly established by President Clinton in his sworn deposition.1119  But in an interview with NBC in November 1993, Hale stated that he was "old friends" with President Clinton and Governor Tucker and that he and President Clinton were "close political friends."1120
<P>Hale, of course, never was a close personal or political friend of Bill Clinton's.  Nor was he a friend or political ally of Tucker's or McDougal's.  Hale was appointed to his municipal court judgeship by Governor Frank White, a Republican and prominent political opponent of Mr. Clinton's, and he made several campaign contributions to Republican candidates, including a $2,000 contribution to White in 1986, when White ran unsuccessfully to unseat Governor Clinton in the general election.1121
<P>Finally, Hale testified at the Tucker/McDougal trial that at the time he made the $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal he was looking "to Jim McDougal and Bill Clinton" for repayment.1122  Yet when the loan failed, Hale made no effort to collect any funds from Governor Clinton.1123
<P>9. President Clinton Testified That He Never Spoke With Hale About A
  Loan For Susan McDougal
<P>President Clinton appeared by videotape as a witness at the Tucker/McDougal trial on May 9, 1996 and testified that he never spoke with Hale about any loan to be made to Susan McDougal:
<P>Q.  Were you ever present in Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street when a discussion occurred about financial assistance from David Hale or his Capital Management Services company involving any other business that you or Mr. McDougal may have had?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No, sir, never.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Were you ever present at any time for any meeting between Jim McDougal and David Hale?
<P><P>
<P>A.  Never, I never was present at any meeting.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Were you ever present when there was any discussion of getting any kind of loan from David Hale or his S.B.I.C.?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever make a statement that your name could not appear on any loan documents or financial documents related to any type of loan from David Hale or his S.B.I.C.?
<P><P>
<P>A.  Absolutely not.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever get assurance from Jim McDougal that your name would be secreted from any loan documents pertaining to any loan from David Hale or his S.B.I.C.?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No, we never had any conversation about it at all.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever tell David Hale that you had property in Marion County, Arkansas that you could use as collateral or security for a loan from him?
<P><P>
<P>A.  I did not do that, no.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make you a loan?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim McDougal a loan?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Susan McDougal a loan?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No, I didn't.
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim Guy Tucker a loan?
<P><P>
<P>A.  No.  
<P><P>
<P>Q.  Did you ever, in any shape, form, or fashion, put any pressure on David Hale for the purpose of obtaining a loan or for the purpose of causing him to make loans through his S.B.I.C.?
<P><P>
<P>A.  I did not put any pressure on David Hale.1124

<P>10.  The Jurors In The Tucker/McDougal Trial Believed President Clinton's
   Testimony And Concluded That Hale Committed Perjury
<P>Several of the jurors in the Tucker/McDougal trial spoke with the press after the verdict and made clear that they believed President Clinton's sworn denials of Hale's allegation.  Juror Tracy Pleasants stated: "I just felt as though he was telling the truth. ... The president's credibility was -- I held him in high esteem as far as credibility."1125  Jury foreperson Sandra Wood added: "The President's credibility was never an issue. ... I just felt like he was telling us to the best of his knowledge what he knew."1126
<P>On the other hand, the jurors concluded that Hale fabricated his testimony concerning his supposed discussions with Governor Clinton about the loan to Susan McDougal.  Juror Colin Capp stated that the jurors considered Hale "an unmitigated liar ... [who] perjured himself. ... David Hale invoked the President's name for one reason: to save his butt.  We all thought that way."1127  Juror Earnest Williams agreed: "I didn't believe a thing Hale said."1128  
<P>Consistent with these comments, the jurors indicated that the guilty verdicts they returned in the case were not at all based on Hale's testimony.  Juror Risa Gayle Briggs stated: "There were so many witnesses presented and called, we were able to use all the other witnesses. ... We didn't need to use David Hale's testimony."1129  Juror Capp added: "I decided I wasn't going to take away anyone's freedom on the testimony of David Hale. ... He's one of the greatest con men whom I've ever seen. ... I think it was an absolute travesty that Hale got sentenced to [only] 24 (sic) months."1130  
<P>11.  Hale's Technique Of Embellishment
<P>It would appear that Hale's testimony about Governor Clinton's supposed interest in the $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal was an embellishment fabricated by Hale with the hope that it would help him secure a better plea deal with an Independent Counsel.  It is a well known device of a skillful liar to use an established fact to provide credibility for his false story.  In this case, that "fact" was Governor Clinton's prior relationship with Jim McDougal.  Since McDougal was no shrinking violet in touting that relationship, all Hale needed to do was embroider his story a bit here and there to involve Governor Clinton.
<P>Hale provided an illuminating example of his proclivity to embellish his story at the Tucker/McDougal trial, when he testified that he knew that part of the proceeds of the $300,000 loan went to the Clintons' benefit in Whitewater.1131  In an earlier CNN interview, Hale claimed to "know that $110,000 of that money went into Whitewater Development, which was owned by the McDougals and the Clintons, and then in turn Whitewater Development used the $110,000 for a downpayment to International Paper on a $550,000 piece of property."1132  
<P>In testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial, Hale reiterated his claim that the Clintons benefited from the $300,000 loan.1133  However, Hale was forced to admit under cross-examination that the basis for this statement was not contemporaneous information provided to him by Governor Clinton or the McDougals, but subsequent information supposedly provided to his "lawyer" by a reporter from The Washington Post.1134  
<P>In fact, while $25,000 was used by McDougal to make a downpayment on property purchased from International Paper, McDougal quickly moved the property out of the Whitewater account and never told the Clintons about it.  It is undisputed that the Clintons never benefitted from McDougal's International Paper deal. 1135  
<P>Another likely example of Hale's penchant for embellishment was his testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial that McDougal told him he was going to meet with Governor Clinton at the Governor's Mansion on a particular Saturday in early January 1986 to discuss the Master Marketing loan.1136  Given Hale's other problems with dates and the sequence of events, one may wonder at the clarity and specificity of this recollection, particularly since it does not appear to have been recorded in any statement Hale provided to the FBI in the forty-plus interviews of him the FBI conducted before his appearance at the trial.  Is it possible that Hale somehow became aware that a log of meetings at the Governor's Mansion on Saturday, January 18, 1986, showed that Governor Clinton met with McDougal that day.1137  In fact, contrary to Hale's embellishment, evidence in the form of contemporaneous memos establishes that the January 18, 1986 Clinton-McDougal meeting was entirely unrelated to the Master Marketing loan.1138
<P>Also illustrative of Hale's inventiveness as a liar was his unsupported assertion that in seizing records from his office on July 21, 1993 pursuant to a search warrant, the FBI lost or destroyed a document which supposedly supported Hale's claim regarding Governor Clinton's involvement in the Master Marketing loan.1139  Inconveniently for Hale, the FBI agent who supervised the search, Special Agent Steven Irons, subsequently became one of the senior agents assigned to Independent Counsel Starr's Little Rock operation.  No more was made about the "missing" document.
<P>12.  Hale's Refusal To Testify Before The Special Committee Without A Grant  Of Blanket Use Immunity 
<P>Despite having testified for nine days at the Tucker/McDougal trial on the same subjects about which the Special Committee sought to question him, Hale asserted a fifth amendment privilege and refused to testify before the Committee absent a grant of blanket use immunity.  Such a grant of immunity, had it been provided, likely would have had the effect of interfering with the stated intention of Arkansas state authorities to prosecute Hale for other serious alleged criminal conduct.  The use immunity demanded by Hale was precisely the same as that conferred upon Oliver North and John Poindexter, whose subsequent Iran-Contra convictions were reversed as a direct result of their immunized testimony before Congress.  
<P>The Special Committee considered many factors in determining whether to grant Hale the blanket use immunity he demanded.  These factors included the importance of Hale's testimony to the Committee's investigation, the strength of Hale's fifth amendment claim, the risks that a grant of immunity would pose to the future state prosecution in Arkansas, the public nature of Hale's nine days of sworn testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial, and the absence of any such precondition set by any of the more than 200 other witnesses who appeared before the Committee.  In a vote of the Special Committee on June 11, 1996, a resolution favoring a grant of immunity for Hale failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required by statute.
<P>Hale's lawyer informed the Special Committee in a letter dated May 23, 1996 that Hale would not appear as required by Committee subpoenas for deposition and public hearing testimony, which at the time were scheduled for May 24, 1996 and June 4, 1996, respectively.  Hale's lawyer referred in his letter to the threatened state prosecution in Arkansas relating to Hale's allegedly fraudulent burial insurance scheme and stated that Hale was asserting his fifth amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.1140
<P> The Special Committee sought the opinion of the Senate Legal Counsel as to the validity of Hale's fifth amendment claim.  In several well-researched and carefully written memoranda, the Senate Legal Counsel advised the Committee that although he could not say with certainty how a court would rule if presented with the issue, he believed that Hale's claim to a fifth amendment privilege with regard to matters within the scope of S.Res. 120 was weak.  More specifically, the Senate Legal Counsel advised the Committee that it was unlikely that Hale could be prosecuted further, in either federal or state court, for crimes related to any of the matters covered by his anticipated testimony before the Committee.  <P>
<P>The Senate Legal Counsel thus advised that as long as the Committee limited its questions of Hale to the subjects within the scope of S.Res. 120 -- that is, as long as the Committee did not question Hale about his allegedly fraudulent burial insurance scheme, for which Hale clearly possessed a valid privilege against compulsory self-incrimination -- Hale likely did not have a valid basis on which to assert a fifth amendment privilege against testifying before the Committee.  Minority staff made clear that it would forego questioning Hale about the burial insurance matter if that would secure his appearance.
<P>The Senate Legal Counsel also advised the Special Committee of the serious risks that a grant of blanket use immunity could pose to any future state prosecution of Hale for his alleged burial insurance fraud.  Those risks emanate principally from the binding decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v. North, 910 F.2d 843 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  
<P>In that decision, the court reversed Oliver North's criminal convictions arising from the Iran-Contra affair, holding that the prosecution had failed to meet its heavy burden of establishing that North's immunized testimony before Congress had no effect on any aspect of North's subsequent criminal prosecution.  The court stated:
<P>[The fifth amendment] does not prohibit simply "a whole lot of use," or "excessive use," or "primary use" of compelled testimony.  It prohibits "any use," direct or indirect.  From a prosecutor's standpoint, an unhappy byproduct of the fifth amendment is that Kastigar may very well require a trial within a trial (or a trial before, during, or after the trial) if such a proceeding is necessary for the court to determine whether or not the government has in any fashion used compelled testimony to indict or convict a defendant.  We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior to such an undertaking.  Such a Kastigar proceeding could consume substantial amounts of time, personnel, and money, only to lead to the conclusion that a defendant -- perhaps a guilty defendant -- cannot be prosecuted.1141
<P>The court thus cautioned that the grave risks to future prosecutions must be carefully considered before a decision is made to confer a grant of use immunity:
<P>[T]he fifth amendment requires that the government establish priorities before making the immunization decision.  The government must occasionally decide which it values more: immunization (perhaps to discharge institutional duties, such as congressional fact-finding and information-dissemination) or prosecution.  If the government chooses immunization, then it must understand that the fifth amendment and Kastigar mean that it is taking great chance that the witness cannot constitutionally be indicted or prosecuted.1142
<P>In light of the Court of Appeals' decision in North, the Senate Legal Counsel cautioned the Special Committee that Hale could obtain for himself an "immunity bath" from all future prosecutions, including the state prosecution for his alleged burial insurance fraud, by providing immunized testimony to the Committee which, even if not technically responsive to the Committee's questions, touched on matters related to the future prosecutions.
<P>It must be emphasized that the accusations against Hale relating to his alleged burial insurance fraud, described above, have not been proven.  Nevertheless, the accusations are extremely serious -- that Hale cynically defrauded the poorest members of society, who used their modest savings to try to provide for a proper burial for their loved ones.  Many on the Special Committee felt it is was very important to avoid any actions that could needlessly interfere with the ability of Arkansas state authorities to bring Hale to justice for this alleged fraud.  
<P>The Majority's focus on Independent Counsel Starr's statement that he did not oppose immunity for Hale misses the point.  It was Starr, after all, who first approached the local prosecutor in Arkansas and asked him to drop the state prosecution altogether.  The local prosecutor considered the Independent Counsel's request and rejected it in a February 13, 1996 letter to Starr:
<P>We have completed our review of a state investigation of David Hale and have decided to charge him with violating Arkansas law.  Mr. Hale has not only committed multiple crimes against the federal government, but there is also probable cause to believe he has independently violated state law as well.  I understand your preference is that this issue be addressed at Hale's federal sentencing; however, I cannot oblige. ...

<P>In the final analysis, it is ultimately a decision for the prosecutor, either state or federal, to determine how to best protect society's interest in bringing wrongdoers to justice.  In the case at bar, David Hale should be held to answer for what I believe to be his fraudulent representations to the State Insurance Department, which are even more egregious considering that he has also defrauded the federal government.1143
<P>Many Members were concerned that Hale, by making a baseless assertion of privilege, was trying to manipulate the Committee into giving him a grant of immunity he did not need.  Many Members failed to understand why Hale was insisting on a grant of immunity to testify before the Committee about the same matters about which he had already testified -- without use immunity -- for nine days at the Tucker/McDougal trial.  Members were concerned that Hale was seeking immunity from the Committee for the improper purpose of obtaining an "immunity bath" so that he could avoid subsequent prosecution for the alleged burial insurance fraud in Arkansas.*  As Senator Kerry stated:
<P>Let's have him come up here.  If he has no assertable Fifth Amendment privilege, let's put that to the test.  Let the system work the way it ought to work.  But let the Committee not be bamboozled and bullied by a legal scheme into giving an immunity that we don't need to give. ...

<P>By what rights should he go to the [Independent Counsel], cut a deal and agree to talk in court, get a lesser sentence and now come up to the Senate Committee and bamboozle the Committee in an [attempt] to come in here and say absolutely anything that he wants whatsoever with the notion that for whatever he says here he can never be prosecuted?1144
<P>
Senator Boxer added:
<P>I think it's fair to say that we don't know if he will be indicted, but I have to tell you, to me, if this is true and this is a person who stole from the poorest of the poor who wanted to bury their loved ones, for me to play a part, in essence granting a pardon in advance because, in a sense, that's what it is when you grant immunity -- and he may blurt something out -- I don't trust him not to.  This man, you are not dealing with someone who has a record of honesty here. ... I think it would be a mistake.1145
<P>Members also noted that little new information was likely to be obtained from Hale's testimony before the Special Committee.  The Committee already had in its possession 1600 pages of transcript of Hale's testimony in the Tucker/McDougal trial on the same subjects about which the Committee sought to question Hale; to the extent evidentiary rulings at the trial precluded Hale from testifying about certain events, the Committee also had in its possession numerous out-of-court statements by Hale relating to those events.  Thus, there was a lesser need for the Committee to obtain Hale's testimony without regard to cost than there might have been had Hale never testified or spoken previously in a public forum.  This simply was not a situation in which the Committee faced an "immunity or nothing" decision.  As Senator Kerry stated:
<P>[Hale] has already spent nine days in a court of this country testifying under oath.  He has been subjected to cross-examination.  That testimony is in our record.  There is no great mystery about what he is going to say except what he might say if he had a blanket use immunity, for which he can say anything.1146
<P>In addition, the Committee had the benefit of the jurors' post-trial comments about Hale's lack of credibility as a witness.  Not only did these comments cause some Members to doubt the sincerity of Hale's privilege assertion, they also raised significant doubt about the value of any testimony Hale might provide to the Committee. 
<P>Finally, several Members of the Committee recognized that Hale's insistence upon a grant of blanket use immunity was unique.  The Committee had called before it more than 200 witnesses, and not one of them had sought a grant of immunity.  
<P>Accordingly, at the Special Committee's public meeting on June 5, 1996, the Committee agreed not to vote on a prepared resolution to confer blanket use immunity on Hale.  Instead, the Committee agreed that Hale would be brought in for a deposition on June 7, 1996 and that any privilege assertions Hale made in response to specific questions posed at the deposition would be ruled on first by the Chairman and then by the full Committee, as required by S.Res. 120 and other Senate precedents.  The Committee agreed that if Hale continued to refuse to answer the Committee's questions the Committee would seek to bring the matter to federal court for a prompt judicial determination of the validity of Hale's assertions of privilege.  
<P>After the June 5, 1996 hearing, the Senate Legal Counsel advised the Committee that the process of litigating the privilege issue in federal court would not be concluded in time for the Committee to obtain a court order requiring Hale's un-immunized testimony before June 14, 1996, the final day for public hearings under the Special Committee's charter.  
<P>On June 6, 1996, the Chairman proposed that the question of the validity of Hale's assertion of privilege be put to a Special Master.  This proposal was foreclosed, however, by a letter the Committee received later the same day from Hale's lawyer.  
<P>The June 6, 1996 letter from Hale's lawyer made clear that Hale would not testify before the Special Committee on any subject whatsoever without a court order granting him blanket use immunity.  The letter made clear, therefore, that Hale would not abide by the ruling of a Special Master, who had no legal authority to bind Hale.  Hale's lawyer wrote:
<P>I have advised the Committee orally and now confirm in writing that Mr. Hale will claim the protection of his Constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and respectfully decline to testify at deposition and at a public hearing if he is compelled to appear in response to the subpoenas.

<P>In the absence of a court order to testify and a grant of immunity as provided by Federal law, any testimony by Mr. Hale regarding any matters before the Special Committee may be used against him in some fashion in connection with an announced criminal prosecution of Mr. Hale in Arkansas and any other state or federal prosecution.1147
<P>Citing the letter from Hale's lawyer, the Chairman canceled Hale's scheduled deposition and noticed a meeting of the Committee for June 11, 1996 to vote on whether to grant immunity to Hale.  At the meeting, the Committee voted 10-8 in favor of granting use immunity to Hale.  Because a two-thirds majority vote is required to pass a resolution granting use immunity, the resolution failed.
<P>The Minority wanted Hale to testify before the Special Committee.  Indeed, the Committee's record establishes beyond any doubt that, beginning in November 1995 and continuing through the late spring of 1996, the Minority sought in vain to persuade the Majority to bring Hale before the Committee.1148  As Senator Sarbanes stated at the Committee's public hearing on January 31, 1996:
<P>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask about David Hale. ... [I]n October of last year [1995] you and I wrote to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel, and advised him that the Committee intended to proceed with [its] investigation, notwithstanding Starr's concerns about the effect the Committee's hearings might have on his investigation because of the Committee's strong interest in concluding its work by February 29, 1996 as provided for in the Senate Resolution 120. 

<P>... On December 7, [1995], after a meeting with Independent Counsel Starr, who, of course, has interposed objections to us hearing from a number of witnesses, the Chairman asked Minority counsel to work with Majority counsel to arrange for Hale's deposition.  Throughout December our counsel, in fact, urged the Majority counsel to begin the process of arranging for Hale's testimony.  And we pointed out in early January that no document subpoena or deposition notice had been sent to Hale.

<P>... Now, we have not, as I understand it, issued a subpoena for the Hale documents, we have not made any arrangements to take the Hale deposition, despite efforts to do so beginning well back in the fall.  Now, I'm at a loss to understand why there hasn't been any follow-up on this matter, and I've put it on the public record because repeated efforts to explore this matter with the Majority have been unsuccessful.  

<P>... We've raised this issue and pressed it repeatedly.  No action has been taken.  I gather there have been communications by Majority counsel with Hale's lawyer, and I take it with the Independent Counsel as well in which we have not been involved or included, and I just feel that, you know, if it's the intention not to proceed, then I think we ought to know that, but I think that we ought to move ahead and we ought to have a subpoena for the Hale documents and a subpoena for his deposition and then we'll see how Mr. Hale and his attorney react to that request from the Committee.  We've been seeking that now for months, literally months, and have gotten -- haven't gotten anywhere with it.1149
<P>Despite its repeated attempts to obtain Hale's testimony, the Minority voted against a grant of blanket use immunity for Hale.  The Minority considered all of the factors discussed above and concluded that the risk that an immunity order would pose to the anticipated state prosecution in Arkansas was too great to endure in light of the seriousness of the alleged burial insurance fraud and other possible but unspecified charges to which Hale's lawyer alluded in his letter to the Committee, the public availability of Hale's nine days of testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial and numerous out-of-court statements by Hale, the absence of a valid legal basis for Hale's assertion of privilege, the apparent lack of credibility of Hale's testimony, and the absence of any other requests for immunity by any of the more than 200 other witnesses who appeared before the Committee.

<H4>  K.  The Pillsbury Madison & Sutro Investigation</H4>
   <P>   1.  Introduction
<P>Pillsbury Madison & Sutro ("PM&S") was retained by the Resolution Trust Corporation (the "RTC") in February 1994 to investigate potential civil fraud claims* relating to Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan ("Madison Guaranty") and Whitewater Development Corporation.1150  PM&S was assisted by the forensic accounting firm of Tucker Alan Inc. ("Tucker Alan") on the Madison Guaranty and Whitewater investigations.  PM&S and Tucker Alan spent over two years investigating Whitewater and Madison Guaranty, at a cost to taxpayers in excess of $3 million.1151
<P>The findings of this comprehensive, independent investigation, as set out in a series of seven written reports totalling over 545 pages, are consistent with the evidence collected by the Special Committee over thirteen months of investigation involving the review of tens of thousands of documents, 282 depositions, 51 days of public hearings, and 8 public meetings:  There is no credible evidence of any wrongdoing by President or Mrs. Clinton in connection with Whitewater or Madison Guaranty.
<P>The fact that two separate, independent governmental investigations, each conducted at enormous effort and taxpayer expense, reached the same result is a point that merits emphasis.  The following discussion summarizes the key findings of the PM&S investigation and explains how those findings are consistent with the evidence developed in the Special Committee's investigation.

<P>2.  The PM&S Investigation was Conducted by Capable, Experienced Lawyers Who Were Not Subject to Any Outside Influence

 <P>Charles Patterson, a senior partner in the Los Angeles office of PM&S, was in charge of the overall investigative effort undertaken by PM&S on behalf of the RTC.  Patterson also was the PM&S attorney with primarily responsibility for the Castle Grande and 1308 Main Street investigations.  Bruce Ericson, a partner in the San Francisco office of PM&S, was the attorney with primary responsibility for the Whitewater and Rose Law Firm investigations.  Jay B. Stephens, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of PM&S and a former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, assisted Patterson and Ericson with the investigation in the preliminary stages, but did not devote substantial attention* to the matter after the fall of 1994.1152
  <P>Patterson, Ericson, and Stephens appeared before the Special Committee on May 17, 1996.  At the May 17 hearing, Patterson and Ericson defended the quality of their investigation, the independence of their firm, and the validity of the analysis and conclusions in their reports.  Ericson testified that, "The buck stopped somewhere, and as far as I am concerned, the buck stops with our firm.  Our name went on it and we had to be satisfied with the finished product.  If we weren't we wouldn't have put our name on it."1153  While Stephens testified that he was not sufficiently involved in the investigation to comment on its findings,* he described Patterson and Ericson as "very experienced and talented" attorneys "who conducted themselves with the highest ethical standards."1154   
<P>Patterson and Ericson told the Committee that no one at the RTC ever sought to influence the conduct of their investigation or the conclusions in their reports.  Patterson testified that PM&S's "conclusions as reached in our reports, were not influenced in any untoward way by any outside source."1155  Ericson confirmed that all of the conclusions in the Pillsbury Madison & Sutro reports reflected his best independent and professional judgment.1156  Patterson also testified that no one ever reviewed the firm's preliminary conclusions and suggested that they needed to be changed.1157  Patterson summed up his firm's role as follows: "We are an independent law firm and we were asked to perform an independent investigation.  And I firmly believe that if the RTC had asked us to change our conclusions, the stated conclusion that they did not agree with, we would not have done that."1158  Stephens said he had "no reason to question Mr. Patterson's statement."1159
<P>Senior RTC officials confirmed that the agency never sought to influence the outcome of the PM&S investigation.  Former RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka testified that the RTC never sought to influence the PM&S investigation:1160
<P><P>Q: Are you aware of any instances where Pillsbury, Madison wanted to look at certain issues or transactions and they were told by the RTC not to look at those issues or transactions?

<P><P>A: Absolutely Not. 
<P><P> 
RTC Senior Counsel Mark Gabrellian also testified that no one at the RTC ever attempted to influence the findings or the conclusions of the PM&S reports.1161  RTC Legal Division Counsel James Igo testified that he was not aware of any instances in which the RTC gave PM&S instructions as to the scope or limitations of their investigation.1162<P>
 <P>     3.  PM&S's Investigation and Findings on the Whitewater Investment
<P>In April 1995 PM&S and Tucker Alan submitted a preliminary report on Whitewater that described the history of the venture.1163  The findings of the preliminary report were consistent with prior public statements by the Clintons that they had been passive investors in Whitewater and that James McDougal had managed the investment.  The preliminary report also concluded that the McDougals had contributed more money to pay Whitewater expenses, primarily interest on bank debt, than the Clintons.  The preliminary report did not, however, answer the question of whether the Clintons were aware that money from the McDougals (as opposed to money from Whitewater land sales) had been used to pay Whitewater expenses.  
<<P>P>In December 1995 PM&S and Tucker Alan completed a supplemental report on Whitewater.1164  With respect to the question of what the Clintons knew about the McDougals' payments of Whitewater expenses, the supplemental report concluded that "on this record, there is no basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything of substance about the McDougals' advances to Whitewater, the source of the funds used to make those advances or the source of the funds used to make payments on the bank debt."1165  That report "recommended that no further resources be expended on the Whitewater part of this investigation."1166 
      4.  PM&S Findings on the Rose Law Firm's Legal Work for Madison Guaranty
<P>PM&S prepared two reports on the representation of Madison Guaranty by the Rose Law Firm (the "RLF").1167  The first RLF report, completed on December 28, 1995, concluded that "[t]he evidence does not provide a basis . . . on which to assert claims against the Rose Law Firm that could be pursued in a cost-effective manner."1168  In testimony provided to the Special Committee, the PM&S attorneys amplified on this point and made clear that PM&S's conclusion that legal action should not be brought against the RLF did not turn on whether or not such action would have been cost effective for the RTC.  When Ericson was questioned at his May 10, 1996 deposition about Madison Guaranty's retention of the RLF, he testified that the cost-effectiveness consideration "was of pretty marginal materiality . . . ."1169   
<P>On February 25, 1996, PM&S completed a second report on the RLF entitled "A Supplemental Report on the Representation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan by the Rose Law Firm" (the "Supplemental RLF Report").1170  With respect to the question of whether the retention of the RLF caused any harm to Madison Guaranty, the Supplemental RLF Report concluded: 
<P><P>Mrs. Clinton's recollections and Mr. Massey's recollections differ in some respect, but for present purposes the differences are not material . . . . it makes little difference who was right.  There is no hint of fraud or intentional misconduct in either version, and the mere act of retaining the Rose Law Firm did not harm Madison Guaranty in any respect.1171  
<P>
In their May 17 hearing testimony Ericson and Patterson testified that nothing has come to their attention since the completion of the reports that would change their conclusion regarding the retention of the RLF.1172  The PM&S attorneys also dismissed the significance of differing recollections of exactly how the RLF came to be retained by Madison Guaranty.  At his May 10, 1996 deposition Ericson testified that "there is still probably consistency" between Mrs. Clinton's recollection of how Madison Guaranty became a client of the Rose Law Firm and Massey's recollection.1173  
<P>As to the securities matters on which the RLF advised Madison Guaranty, PM&S concluded: "It does not appear that the Rose Law Firm's work deterred Arkansas regulators from doing anything they might have done."1174  The report also noted that "if anything, the Arkansas regulators took a more aggressive position toward Madison Guaranty than did the FHLBB."1175  (As discussed above, Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett recommended to federal authorities in 1987 that Madison Guaranty be closed, but the federal authorities did not act on that recommendation until 1989.)
<P>After the RLF billing records were found in the White House in January 4, 1995, and provided to the RTC, PM&S conducted further investigation of the RLF's work for Madison Guaranty.  The Supplemental RLF Report describes the significance of the billing records as follows:
<P><P>The billing records found at the White House and other newly acquired evidence add considerably to the sum of knowledge with respect to this matter. Taken as a whole, however, the new evidence does not change the conclusions stated in the Rose Report. The new evidence has very little effect on the analysis of what the Rose Law Firm knew and did before the acquisition of the IDC property closed.  The new evidence shows that, after the acquisition closed, lawyers at the Rose Law Firm (and in particular Mrs. Clinton) had more contact with Seth Ward and performed more services for Madison Guaranty than previously was known, but there remains no substantial evidence that these lawyers knew of or intended to aid and abet McDougal's apparent misconduct.1176
<P>
The Supplemental RLF Report found that "a trier of fact is highly unlikely to find that there was anything untoward, let alone fraudulent or intentionally wrongful, in the circumstances of the Rose Law's retention by Madison Guaranty."1177  Ericson testified that PM&S found no evidence that either the Clintons or the RLF engaged in any fraudulent activity in connection with the matters under investigation:1178
<P><P>Q: The conclusions that you reached and put forward involved conclusions about activities of others and involved conclusions about fraud.  What was your conclusion about whether Mr. or Mrs. Clinton engaged in fraudulent activity or whether the Rose Law Firm engaged in fraudulent activity?

<P><P>A: We found no evidence of either.
<P><P>
<P><P>Q: No evidence of fraud either by the Clintons or the Rose Law Firm in connection with the matters under investigation? Is that correct?

<P><P>A: That's right.
  
<P>PM&S also concluded in the Supplemental RLF Report that Madison Guaranty did not retain the RLF as a means to pay $2,000 a month to the Clintons: 
<P><P>The alleged economic motivation makes no sense.  McDougal suggests the Clintons needed $2,000 a month, and the implication is that this accounts for the monthly retainer in that amount, but there is no evidence that the Clintons ever received anything like $2000 a month from this engagement, and every reason to believe that they never received more than a trivial sum of money.1179 
<P>
After over two years of investigation, and with the benefit of having analyzed the RLF billing records for the Madison Guaranty engagement, PM&S dismissed the theory that the purpose of Madison Guaranty's retention of the RLF was to confer an economic benefit on the Clintons.
      5.  PM&S Key Findings on Conspiracy Theories Involving the Rose Law  Firm

<P>PM&S also investigated whether RLF attorneys were involved in any misconduct by Madison Guaranty officials in connection with the IDC acquisition and the subsequent resales of parcels of that property (discussed above).  PM&S found no evidence that RLF attorneys were aware of any wrongdoing in connection with the IDC and Castle Grande property.  The first RLF report by PM&S concluded:  
<P><P>The evidence taken as a whole does not amount to convincing proof that the Rose Law Firm knowingly aided and abetted a fraud, or a scheme to circumvent the Arkansas investment limitation regulation.  This conclusion does not necessarily mean that the evidence exonerates anyone; it simply means, given the applicable legal standards and the statutory mandate under which the RTC operates, that no reasonable basis has been found to recommend the filing of a claim relating to the acquisition of Castle Grande against the Rose Law Firm.1180  

<P>PM&S reaffirmed this conclusion in the Supplemental RLF Report1181 and in their testimony at the May 17 hearing.1182  With respect to conspiracy theories, PM&S concluded:
<P><P>It simply would not be persuasive to argue that, for $21,000 [the amount of legal fees Madison Guaranty paid to the RLF], McDougal corrupted the Rose Law Firm and convinced half a dozen lawyers, most of whom he did not know, to join him in a scheme to violate the law.1183

In his testimony at the Committee's May 17 hearing,1184  Ericson also confirmed another conclusion on conspiracy theories set out in the Supplemental RLF Report:
<P><P>The conspiracy theory [involving the RLF] is hopelessly flawed.  The Independent Counsel already has alleged a different conspiracy -- the conspiracy with Tucker -- involving the same property, IDC/Castle Grande. . . . The principals were cut in on the deals, and relatively large amounts of money changed hands (six figures, it is alleged).  Whatever one thinks of that, however, it strains common sense to place a second set of conspirators on the same property -- a set that included half a dozen lawyers who had never met McDougal before, a set that was not cut in on the deals, a set whose senior members stood to gain something on the order of $20 a month.1185

In short, PM&S found no credible evidence that Rose Law Firm attorneys were participants in whatever misconduct may have occurred in connection with the IDC property.* 
    <P>  6.  The Role of Jay Stephens

<P>The PM&S reports, particularly the two Whitewater reports and the two RLF reports, generally have been viewed as favorable to the Clintons and the RLF.  Based upon the questions raised at the May 17 hearing, it appeared that some Committee members may have suspected that RTC officials sought to have Stephens removed from the investigation, perhaps because of the well-publicized concerns about Stephens that allegedly were expressed by some Clinton Administration officials when PM&S initially was retained by the RTC.  There is no evidence of any such RTC action or influence. The PM&S attorneys all testified that Stephens's diminished involvement in the investigations after the summer of 1994 reflected an internal staffing decision by the law firm and was not the result of any outside influence.  Patterson assigned the areas of investigative responsibility, and Stephens's role diminished because the work was being done by Patterson and Ericson with support from the firm's Los Angeles and San Francisco offices.  Patterson testified that no one at the RTC ever suggested that he remove Stephens from the investigation.1186  
<P>It also should be noted that Stephens was invited to review the reports his partners had prepared, but agreed to do so only in one instance.  In late 1994 Ericson provided Stephens a draft of the preliminary Whitewater report and solicited his comments on the draft.1187  Stephens gave Ericson comments, and Ericson took those comments into account in preparing the final version of the preliminary report.1188  Later in 1995, after the preliminary report on Whitewater had been made public and reported on by the press as generally favorable to the Clintons,* Stephens declined to review drafts of the final reports: 
<P><P>Well in fact the RTC asked me to read all the reports when the reports were filed in December.  I declined to do that because I had not been involved in the engagement.  I thought it was improper and inappropriate for me to review those reports simply so the RTC could have my imprimatur on those reports.1189 
<P>
Patterson indicated that he called the RTC about Stephens's position on review of the draft reports, and they said, "no problem."1190  The RTC did not pursue the matter or pressure the firm to have Stephens review the drafts.   
<P>It is not clear why Stephens thought it was "improper" for him to review drafts of the final PM&S reports when the client1191 and his partners1192 asked him to do so.  Stephens seems to have worked on the project enough to be generally familiar with the issues in the investigation (he billed the RTC $67,950 for 339.75 hours of work in 1994 and 1995).1193  In view of Stephens's expertise in criminal law and experience as a United States Attorney and a senior official at the Department of Justice, it was reasonable for the RTC to ask him to review the reports and provide comments.1194  Clients often ask law firms to have a member of the firm who has expertise in a particular substantive area review a document and provide comments.1195  In fact, the RTC even followed this procedure internally, asking a staff member who had not been involved in the Madison Guaranty investigation to review drafts of final PM&S reports.1196  The RTC attorney agreed to review the reports even though he had not been involved in the investigation.  Stephens, in contrast, refused to review the drafts, because he did not want to put his "imprimatur" on the reports.  The question remains, however, why the RTC, after paying the law firm in which Stephens was a partner over $2 million for legal services and paying the firm $67,9501197 for Stephens's own work on the project, was not entitled to have Stephens review and provide comments on the final draft reports (as he had done with the preliminary Whitewater report).  In any event, Stephens refused the requests of his client and his partners and did not review the draft reports.1198
      7.  Questions Concerning the Thoroughness of PM&S's Investigation and the  Validity of the Conclusions in the PM&S Reports

<P>The Special Committee reviewed the thoroughness of the PM&S investigation and the validity of conclusions in the PM&S reports.  At the May 17 hearing the Committee explored whether PM&S should have interviewed more witnesses in Arkansas. The hearing testimony established that PM&S exercised professional judgment as to whether or not interviewing a particular witness was likely to yield relevant evidence and therefore merited deposing or interviewing.  While PM&S attorneys acknowledged that it always is helpful to interview or depose additional witnesses, they did not concede that their inability to interview all the persons involved undermines the analysis or conclusions in their reports.1199    
<P>At the May 17 hearing the Majority pointed out that PM&S did not interview the McDougals, David Hale, Jim Guy Tucker, Chris Wade (except a very preliminary initial interview), Seth Ward, John Latham, David Knight, and the Rose Law Firm attorneys involved in the acquisition of the IDC property.  Ericson and Patterson explained that the Office of the Independent Counsel refused to allow PM&S to interview some of the witnesses.1200  As to other witnesses, including bank officials involved in the Whitewater loan (Frank Burge, James Patterson, Ron Procter, and Robert Ritter), Ericson testified that their testimony would have been "of marginal interest and basically a waste of money."1201  
<P>Although in a complex investigation it always is difficult to establish conclusively that a particular witness need not be interviewed (in effect doing so requires one to "prove a negative"), the PM&S attorneys asserted that they conducted sufficient interviews and that the additional witnesses suggested by the Majority at the May 17 hearing likely would not have provided evidence that would change the conclusions reached by PM&S and Tucker Alan.1202  Perhaps most important, the hearing testimony made clear that the selection of witnesses was made by PM&S without any interference from the RTC or anyone else in government and that no one at the RTC ever told PM&S not to interview certain witnesses.1203  
<P>Questions also were raised at the May 17 hearing as to whether the cost of the PM&S investigation was justified by the amount of potential damages the RTC could potentially recover in any civil litigation relating to Madison Guaranty that might have been initiated by the agency.  The concern raised by the Majority seems to have been that while it was apparent to PM&S and the RTC early in the investigation that litigation would not be cost-effective, lengthy reports that were favorable to the Clintons and the Rose Law Firm nonetheless were prepared.  The witnesses examined by the Special Committee uniformly explained that for the RTC the investigation involved the integrity of the agency, so more than the cost-effectiveness of litigation was at stake.1204  Gabrellian confirmed that money was only one factor in the agency's decision to conduct a complete investigation:  "It was pretty clear from the dollars involved that, on its own, any claims identified out of the relationship with Whitewater would not be cost-effective."1205  With respect to the larger question of the credibility of the agency, however, Gabrellian explained:1206
<P><P>I think that . . . with respect to pursuit of the investigation phase involving Whitewater Development Corporation, and the explanation that I believe was given on the record before congressional committees by the [RTC] general counsel and [RTC] deputy CEO, as well as the explanations given to me by my upper management, was that Whitewater Development should be thoroughly investigated, and that even though, in and of itself, it may not be a cost-effective claim to pursue, that there were issues of RTC credibility that necessitated pursuing that phase of the investigation as well as other phases of the investigation that may, in and of themselves, lead to cost-effective claims.  <P>

<P>The Committee also explored whether any "new facts" have come to light since PM&S issued their reports that might change the conclusions in the reports.  Patterson and Ericson did not concede that any of the so-called "new evidence" that has been obtained by the Special Committee since PM&S completed its reports would alter the conclusions in those reports.*  Ericson testified that no new evidence had come forward since the completion of the PM&S reports that made him feel that the conclusions in those reports were not accurate.1207  
<P>In short, the conclusions reached by PM&S after two years of investigation remain valid and now have been confirmed by the Special Committee's own exhaustive investigation.<P>

<H2>IV.  FOSTER PHASE</H2>

<H3>  A.  Introduction </H3>

<P>Senate Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to review "whether improper conduct occurred regarding the way in which White House officials handled documents in the office of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster following his death."  This inquiry focused on the entry by three White House officials of Foster's office the night he died, the review two days later of documents in Foster's office by White House officials in the presence of law enforcement personnel, and the subsequent disposition of those documents, including personal papers of President and Mrs. Clinton.  
<P>Some witnesses had differing recollections regarding those events or were unable to recall events in detail.  This is not surprising, given the emotional stress that many of those individuals experienced following the suicide and the two years that have passed since those events.  It is inevitable that the testimony is incomplete or contradictory in some respects.
<P>The Majority seeks to make much of these inconsistencies.  Yet, the Majority often ignores divergent testimony when the testimony does not fit its theories.  The Majority's selective recitation of testimony, however, cannot alter the fact that the Committee has not heard evidence demonstrating an effort to destroy or suppress any documents that were in Foster's office at the time of his suicide.
<P>With respect to the entry of Foster's office the night he died, it has not been established that any improper conduct occurred.  At the request of David Watkins, Patsy Thomasson entered Foster's office the night of July 20, 1993 to look for a suicide note.  Bernard Nussbaum and Margaret Williams also entered the office, to look for a note and grieve.  While their recollections differ as to the order in which they entered and left the office, they all testified that they remained in the office briefly, reviewed no documents, and removed nothing.
<P>With respect to the review of documents, the procedures employed by White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum did not impede the investigation of Foster's death.  The Park Police had no authority to review all the documents in Foster's office, and in any event were interested only in documents that would shed light on Foster's state of mind.  The Park Police were provided with all documents in which they expressed an interest; some were provided to them on the spot while others were provided within a few days.
<P>Finally, with respect to the disposition of documents, it was appropriate for Nussbaum to transfer the Clintons' personal files to the custody of their private attorney, Robert Barnett of Williams & Connolly.  No evidence presented to the Committee indicates that any personal files of the Clintons' present in Foster's office at the time of his death were removed or altered before they were transmitted to Williams & Connolly.
<P>1.  Events at Foster's Office the Night of His Death

<P>    a.  David Watkins Asked Patsy Thomasson to Look in Foster's Office for a Suicide Note

<P>In July 1993, David Watkins was serving as Assistant to the President for Management and Administration.  In that position, he supervised the provision of administrative and personnel services to the fourteen agencies within the Executive Office of the President.  Watkins's principal assistant was Patsy Thomasson, Special Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Administration.  
<P>Because his duties frequently involved interaction with the United States Secret Service, Watkins was one of the first members of the White House staff to learn of Foster's death.  On the night of July 20, 1993, Watkins was paged by the Secret Service.  When he returned the page, the Secret Service informed him of the discovery of Foster's body and provided him with a telephone number for the Park Police.1  Watkins called and arranged for Park Police Sergeant Cheryl Braun and Detective John Rolla to pick him up so that he might accompany them to the Foster home to notify Mrs. Foster of her husband's death.2  
<P>Watkins described the scene at the Foster home as one of "sadness, extreme grief:"
<P>. . . I arrived with the officers . . . from the Park Police, Ms. Braun and Mr. Rolla . . . just as we arrived, Sharon Bowman, a sister of Mr. Foster, and Sheila Anthony, another sister, and Web Hubbell arrived. . . . The officers notified Lisa that Vince had shot himself and there were cries of anguish and everyone was trying to comfort the family and comfort those that were there.3

<P>A short while later, Watkins paged Thomasson from the Foster home to notify her of Foster's death:  
<P>I beeped Patsy to notify her of the death.  She was my deputy.  She knew Vince.  She was from Arkansas, and just to notify her.4

<P>Watkins had learned from the Park Police officers that no suicide note had been found at Fort Marcy Park.5  By the time Thomasson returned Watkins's page, there had been conversation at the Foster home regarding a suicide note and it was apparent that Foster had not left a suicide note at his home either.6  Watkins "advised her of Vince's death and I asked her to go to his office and look for a note, a suicide note."7
<P>I said we were wondering if there might be a note in Vince's office, would you go look for one?  That's what I asked her.8

<P>Thomasson's recollection of how she came to enter Foster's office that night corresponds with Watkins's.  She testified
<P>On July 20, 1993, I had dinner with a friend from Arkansas. . . . As we left the restaurant after dinner, I received a page from the White House operator telling me to page David Watkins with my location. . . . I went into the restaurant and called from a pay phone.  The White House operator asked me to give her a phone number so that Mr. Watkins could call me.  I told her . . . I would prefer to hold while she got Mr. Watkins on the phone for me.

<P>After a wait of several minutes, the operator connected Mr. Watkins and me.  He told me at that time that Vince Foster had killed himself.  I was in shock.  I was in disbelief.  I could not believe that my friend and colleague had killed himself.  I asked Mr. Watkins at the time to repeat that message to me.  I immediately asked David how I could help.  He asked me to go to Vince's office to see if Vince left a suicide note.  He told me to page him after I looked and let him know what I found.9

<P>Watkins did not discuss the contents of Foster's office with Thomasson, did not ask her to look for any papers in Foster's office other than a suicide note, and did not ask her to remove any papers from the office.10
<P>    b.  Patsy Thomasson Briefly Looked in Foster's Office for a Suicide Note

<P>After her telephone conversation with Watkins, Thomasson took a taxi to the White House and entered her own office briefly.  On the first floor of the West Wing, she recalled seeing several White House staff members, including White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  Thomasson recalled the mood at the White House was one of shock and grief:
<P>Everyone who was at the White House that I saw was very distraught.  Most everyone there was in tears, both men and women.11
<P>
She described her own state of mind as "distraught:"

<P>I was so crushed that my friend killed himself, someone I worked with on a day-to-day basis.  I felt somehow that I had failed.  To not recognize in someone you work with every day that they were depressed and that stressed out was somehow a failure on the part of those who worked with him every day.12

<P>Thomasson recalled that she and Nussbaum entered Foster's office together.13  She told the Committee of her brief, unsuccessful effort to locate a suicide note in the office:
<P>As we entered, I looked on the surfaces of the furniture to see if I could see a note.  Nothing was immediately apparent. . . . I sat at Vince's desk, opened the drawers to the desk to see if there was anything that looked like a suicide note.  I looked in the top of his briefcase, which was sitting on the floor.14
<P>
Thomasson did not study the particular documents in or on Foster's desk.  She noted, 

<P>I didn't go through every individual file in his desk or anything like that.  I just looked in the top of the drawers and the top of the desk to see if there was something there that would be a suicide note.15
<P>
She did not pull out the papers that were in the briefcase.16

<P>Thomasson recalled that Nussbaum left the office for a few minutes, during which time Margaret Williams entered.
<P>Maggie Williams came in and sat down opposite me.  She was crying and visibly grieving.  We sat together, me at Vince's desk, Maggie across from me, crying, and asking each other why.17

<P>we did talk about Vince and we talked about how helpful he always was to us . .  . and so we were really going to miss him.18

<P>She and I talked and cried together for several minutes and then Maggie left and Nussbaum came back in.19

<P>Thomasson recalled she spent approximately 10 minutes in Foster's office that night.20  She recalled that she and Nussbaum left Foster's office together, removing nothing.21  Neither she, nor Nussbaum, nor Williams removed or destroyed any documents from Foster's office.22
<P>    c.  Bernard Nussbaum Also Entered Foster's Office to Look for a Suicide Note

<P>While Nussbaum recalled his movements that night somewhat differently than did Thomasson, he also recalled that they were in Foster's office for no more than 10 minutes and removed nothing.  Nussbaum was paged in a restaurant on the night of July 20 and informed of Foster's apparent suicide.  Nussbaum returned first to the White House residence; after President Clinton left the residence for the Foster home, Nussbaum returned to the White House Counsel's suite.  He intended to telephone members of his staff from his office to break the news of Foster's death.23  He recalled that Thomasson and Williams were in Foster's office when he arrived:
<P>As I walked to my office it occurred to me that perhaps Vince left a note telling us why he had taken his life.  I decided to go to his office, which was next to mine, to see if there was a suicide note.  When I reached the White House Counsel's suite at around 10:45 p.m., I found the door open.  Patsy Thomasson and Maggie Williams . . . were in Vince's office.  Maggie was sitting on Vince's sofa crying.  Patsy, who was sitting behind Vince's desk, said they had just arrived. . . . Patsy told me she was looking for a suicide note.  Patsy and I checked the surfaces in Vince's office.  We opened a drawer or two looking for a note.  No one . . . looked through Vince's files.  Patsy did not examine any individual file.  She did not rummage through or examine any individual file, nor did I.

<P>. . . The three of us then left the office.  Nothing was removed by any of us.  We were there no more than 10 minutes.24

<P>Thomasson described Nussbaum's activities in Foster's office that night as follows:
<P>Bernie was grieving.  He was walking back and forth in the office. . . . running his hands through his hair. . . . He was very upset that night. . . . He was very distraught about Vince's death that night. . . . it was apparent that Mr. Nussbaum had been crying . . .25

<P>Nussbaum was quite clear that while the Counsel's suite may have been unlocked for approximately one hour, during which time he was calling his staff from his office, he, Thomasson and Williams were in Foster's office for only 10 minutes.26
<P>    d.  Margaret Williams Went to Foster's Office Out of a Sense of Grief

<P>Margaret Williams, Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to the First Lady, received two telephone calls at home from Mrs. Clinton on the night of July 20.  Mrs. Clinton first called en route from California to Arkansas, informing Williams she would call again after her airplane landed.27  Mrs. Clinton then called again and informed Williams of Foster's suicide.  Mrs. Clinton made no reference to any files in Foster's office.28  Mrs. Clinton did not instruct Williams to go to Foster's office.29
<P>Williams testified she called her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, "almost immediately" after speaking with Mrs. Clinton.30  Mrs. Lieberman's recollection was the same:
<P>Maggie called and she said either Vince was dead or Vince committed suicide.  She was very upset, very upset, and I just said stay there, I'm coming to get you, and I put down the phone.  I mean, it was very brief.31
<P>
Mrs. Lieberman testified she picked Williams up:  "she got into the car, and she was crying, pretty hysterical."32
<P>Williams and Mrs. Lieberman then returned to the White House; Lieberman explained
<P>we wanted to see if we were needed.  I didn't know what else to do, and we just drove over there.  I don't think there was much talk of where should we go and what should we do.33
<P>
Once at the White House, Williams reviewed a copy of the press release announcing Foster's death, and sought a copy of the First Lady's schedule, to determine if any events needed to be canceled.34
<P>Later that night, Williams entered Foster's office.  She described her reasons for doing so as follows:
<P>At some point in that evening, I noticed a light was on in Vince Foster's office.  All evening, I had been avoiding looking in the direction of Vince's office as I entered and left the First Lady's suite.  But in a strange way, when I saw the light on in his office, I had this hope, albeit irrational, that I would walk in and I would find Vince Foster there.35
<P>
Williams recalled that Thomasson was in Foster's office when she entered: 

<P>When I walked into his office, I found Patsy Thomasson sitting behind Vince's desk, looking, as I later learned, possibly for a suicide note.  I began to cry.  I sat on Vince's couch, and I cried the whole time.36

<P>I remember her saying . . . something to the effect that we could give Lisa some comfort if there was a note or if there was a note, we could give Lisa some comfort.37

<P>While Thomasson recalled that Williams entered after Nussbaum left, Williams recalled that Nussbaum entered while she was in Foster's office.  Her description of Nussbaum's behavior echoed that of Thomasson:
<P>Bernie Nussbaum at one point came in and wandered around the office.  He seemed at a loss for what he should do.38

<P>He was pacing and scratching the back of his head and trying to think of something to say to either of us.39
<P>
Williams's recollection, that she and Nussbaum left "fairly close to each other in time"40, with Thomasson remaining in the office, differs from Thomasson's recollection.  As described above, Thomasson recalled that Williams left first and that she and Nussbaum left together.
<P>After returning home late that night Williams spoke by telephone with the First Lady, and spoke with her again the next day.  They did not have any discussion of files in Foster's office.41
<P>    e.  Officer O'Neill's Testimony
<P>On duty at the White House the night of July 20, 1993 was Officer Henry O'Neill of the Uniformed Division of the U.S. Secret Service.  Alone among the witnesses who appeared before the Committee, Officer O'Neill recalled that Margaret Williams had removed something from the White House Counsel's office that night.
<P>In July 1993, Officer O'Neill was assigned the task of accompanying cleaning crews as they went about their nightly rounds in the West Wing of the White House.  At 10:42 p.m. on July 20, 1993, Officer O'Neill unlocked the door of the White House Counsel's suite in the West Wing so that the cleaning crew could enter.42  Officer O'Neill recalled that shortly thereafter, Bernard Nussbaum "walked into the office, and just about the same time I noticed other figures walk in behind him and I heard women's voices."43  Officer O'Neill could not recall whether Nussbaum was accompanied by one or two other people.44  He recalled that they entered Nussbaum's office, not Foster's.45
<P>Officer O'Neill recalled that after leaving the Counsel's suite, he encountered Howard Paster, Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, who informed him of Foster's suicide.46  He then returned to the hallway outside the Counsel's suite, where he recalled that he spoke with a woman who appeared to him to have just come out of the suite.47  He recalled that this woman, who introduced herself as Evelyn Lieberman, "asked me about locking up the office, and I said I would take care of it."48
<P>Officer O'Neill recalled that some time later, he returned to the Counsel's suite to lock it.  As he was entering Foster's office, he saw a woman whom he later learned to be Patsy Thomasson sitting at Foster's desk.49  He left the suite again, and later returned a third time.50  Officer O'Neill testified that at this time he
<P>saw Evelyn Lieberman walk out of the counsel's suite.  She stood in front of the doorway and I looked at her, and, again, it was mentioned about locking the office.  And then a few seconds after I saw her come out, Mr. Nussbaum walked out behind her and walked through the hallway, toward the stairs, past the elevator, and within a few more seconds, I saw Maggie Williams walk out of the suite and turn to the right in the direction that I was standing. . . . She was carrying what I would describe, in her arms and hands, as folders.51
<P>
Officer O'Neill then locked the Counsel's suite, according to records at 11:41 p.m.52  Officer O'Neill recalled that Williams was the last person he saw exit the Counsel's suite that night.53
<P>    f.  Contradictions in Officer O'Neill's Testimony
<P>In the deposition he gave to Committee counsel on June 23, 1995, Officer O'Neill was uncertain as to what he had seen Williams carry.  At his deposition, Officer O'Neill first testified that he saw Williams carrying "files . . . folders on top of each other."54  At a later point, he added
<P>In fact, she may have even been carrying a box.  I can't remember.  She had her hands down in front of her.  I remember that, and she was carrying something in front of her.   I think I remember folders as I saw her approach in my direction, and it was like folders.  But I can't remember if there was a box on top of them, like a cardboard box that is used for files also.  I can't remember that.

<P>Q.  Do you have some picture in your mind of a box?

<P>A.  Kind of like, yeah.

<P>Q.  How big is that box in the picture in your mind?

<P>A.  Like a hat box, a small hat box.  I don't know.

<P>Q.  Was the box open?

<P>A.  No.  I said files originally. I said 3 to 5 inches, and it seemed -- I mean, I know that it was a bundle.  I told you that.  It was something that was of some weight.  That's basically how I would like to continue to state it.  I don't want to try to dream up a box.  This is getting confusing now because I can't remember if I saw her -- I know I remember seeing her carry something in her arms.55
<P>
Asked by Senator Boxer at the Committee's hearing about this testimony, Officer O'Neill suggested, "let's just strike the hatbox."56
<P>Officer O'Neill testified before the Committee that the cleaning crew he was escorting never entered Foster's office.57  In fact, the cleaning crew did remove the trash from Foster's office; Sylvia Mathews later recovered it and it was made available to the investigators.  In his deposition, Officer O'Neill testified that there was a burn bag in Foster's office on July 20, 1993, and that he had not emptied the burn bags in the Counsel's suite that night.58  One month later, testifying before the Committee, Officer O'Neill could not recall whether there was a burn bag in Foster's office, nor whether he had collected the burn bag material in the reception area of the suite.59
<P>Officer O'Neill was not required to file any report concerning the events of that night and did not do so, nor did he make any personal notes of his observations.  In fact, he had no opportunity to recount his recollections until April 1994, nine months later, when he was interviewed by FBI agents assigned to Independent Counsel Fiske.60  In the meantime, press attention had been focused on the contents of Foster's office by a December 20, 1993 newspaper article regarding the removal of Whitewater documents from Foster's office.  Officer O'Neill was aware of these articles; at his deposition, he stated
<P>I remember sometime later, not close or near the time of the events surrounding the [July] 20th, it was sometime later that I remember for the first time noticing in the newspaper about documents, stated in the newspaper articles that I read about documents being taken from the counsel's office.  In fact, I think by Maggie Williams, in fact.61
<P>
While he initially testified before the Committee that he "had never read anything about anyone taking any files out of any office;" he later amended that testimony, saying, "I did read something about it, yes."62
<P>Williams was quite clear in her testimony that she did not remove documents from Foster's office:
<P>I took nothing from Vince's office.  I didn't go into Foster's office with anything in mind concerning any documents that might be in his office.  I did not look at, inspect or remove any documents.  At no time was I instructed by anyone nor was there any suggestion from anyone that I go into Vince's office on the evening of July 20th.  I disturbed nothing while I was there.63

<P>Mr. Ben-Veniste:  When you left the office, Ms. Williams, again, did you take any material of Mr. Foster's from that office?

<P>Ms. Williams:  No, I did not.

<P>Mr. Ben-Veniste:  Did anyone ask you to take any material, files, folders, boxes, any materials from that office that night?

<P>Ms. Williams:  No.64

<P>Williams's testimony is supported by the results of two polygraph examinations.  The first polygraph was arranged by her counsel and administered by a distinguished expert in the field, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent.  He asked Williams the following questions:
<P>Did you remove any documents from Foster's office that night?

<P>To your personal knowledge did anyone remove documents from Foster's office that night?

<P>Did you discuss removing any documents, excepting a suicide note, from Foster's office that night?

<P>Were you aware that night of others discussing document removal excepting a suicide note?

<P>Do you now know of anyone removing documents from Foster's office that night?

<P>Excepting a suicide note, do you now know of any discussion by anyone about removal of documents from Foster's office that night?65
<P>
Williams answered "no" to each question, and the polygrapher concluded "it is my opinion Williams was not deceptive (was truthful) when she answered these issue questions above as she did."66  Williams also volunteered to a polygraph examination by the Office of Independent Counsel.  Williams's counsel provided the Committee with a sworn affidavit, stating
<P>After the examination was completed, the polygrapher advised . . . that the examination indicated that Ms. Williams was truthful in her assertion that she did not remove any documents from Foster's office on the night of his death.

<P>The Special Committee requested a copy of this polygraph report from the Office of the Independent Counsel.  The Special Committee also requested reports of interviews the Independent Counsel's Office conducted of Williams and Officer O'Neill.67  Officer O'Neill testified that he was interviewed by FBI agents and representatives of the Office of the Independent Counsel five or six times.68  The Independent Counsel declined to produce this information, citing a policy against disclosure of investigative work product.69*  No explanation has been given to the Special Committee regarding why the Independent Counsel found it necessary to conduct so many interviews of Officer O'Neill. 
<P>No witness other than Officer O'Neill claims Williams removed anything from Foster's office that night.  Mrs. Lieberman testified she did not see Williams carry any files, folders or boxes the night of July 20.70  Nussbaum testified that to his knowledge no one removed anything from Foster's office on July 20.71  Thomasson is not aware of anyone removing any documents from the office that night.72  Officer O'Neill himself is uncertain as to what he recalls Williams was carrying.  He did not memorialize his observations at the time of the events, and testified to them only after reading in the newspapers about documents taken from Foster's office.  Officer O'Neill may have seen Williams carrying folders on another occasion, which he now recalls to have been the night of July 20, 1993.*  It is also possible that when questioned regarding the events of July 20, 1993, his memory was inaccurately stimulated by the news articles of December 1993.**  Given these factors, the evidence does not establish that Williams removed anything from Foster's office on the night of July 20, 1993.
<P>    g.  White House Officials Told Law Enforcement About the Search for the Suicide Note

<P>White House officials told law enforcement officials about the search for a suicide note on July 20.  This suggests that their entry into Foster's office was as they testified:  a brief review of the office for a suicide note.
<P>Thomasson made no effort to keep her trip to the White House secret.  To the contrary, she notified the Secret Service when she entered her office.73  Further, she recalled she told Nussbaum in the presence of other White House staff that Watkins had asked her to look for a suicide note in Foster's office:
<P>[Mr. Nussbaum] walked up while I was talking to some of the others and I said, Bernie, I've been asked by David to go up to Vince's office to look for a note, will you go with me?74

<P>At his first opportunity, on the morning of July 21, Nussbaum told Detective Peter Markland, the Park Police detective in charge of investigation Foster's death, that he, Patsy Thomasson and Maggie Williams had entered Foster's office the night before to look for a suicide note.75  Nussbaum testified, "I told him that Patsy and I briefly looked for a suicide note and found nothing."76  Detective Markland included this information in his report.77
<P>2.  White House Officials Did Not Receive a Request from the Park Police to Seal Foster's Office

<P>Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla picked up David Watkins at his home and drove him to the Foster home in Georgetown, so he could accompany them when they notified Mrs. Foster of her husband's death.78  The Park Police officers remained at the Foster home for approximately one hour.  
<P>Sergeant Braun recalled that she "had a brief conversation with Mr. Watkins as [she] was on [her] way out the door."79  While Sergeant Braun does not recall the exact words she used, she remembered that she "asked that Mr. Watkins see that Mr. Foster's office was secured so that we could send somebody in the morning out to check his office."80  "I explained to him that the office would need to be closed so that we could go through it the next day to look for a suicide note or evidence that would confirm the suicide."81  She specifically testified that she did not request that the office be "sealed;" she simply "wanted to keep the office intact the way it was when Mr. Foster left it and to keep people from rummaging through."82  She did not ask, nor did she intend, that White House personnel authorized to enter Foster's office be barred from entry.83  Sergeant Braun recalled that Watkins "acknowledged my request."84  
<P>While Sergeant Braun recalls making this request of Watkins, she did not mention making such a request in her written report of the visit to the Foster home.85  Asked why she did not include this information, she said, "it did not come to me as I was sitting there at the PC putting together my report."86  Neither did she mention such a request to Captain Hume when she briefed him the next morning on the events of the previous night.87  
<P>Watkins has no recollection of Sergeant Braun making such a request.88  He testified further
<P>the Park Police had been in touch with the Secret Service for some five hours prior to making that request.  . . . they had not shown a locality of interest to me, at least, in the office of Vince Foster's [sic].  And I assumed that if this had been of great concern with them, they would have contacted the Secret Service, whom they had been in touch with.89

<P>Sergeant Braun, Detective Rolla and Watkins agree that the scene at the Foster house that night was chaotic.  Detective Rolla described the scene as "traumatic" and said the family members were "crying, screaming, collapsing."90  Watkins described it as "a scene of sadness, extreme grief;" there were "cries of anguish" when the Foster family first learned of their loved one's death.91
<P>Park Police Captain Charles Hume, Assistant Commander of the Criminal Investigations Branch in Washington, DC, did not believe that a request had been made on July 20 of the White House that Foster's office be sealed.  Captain Hume testified that when he arrived at the White House around 11:00 a.m. on July 21, he asked the Secret Service to seal that office.92  He "thought that was the first request" from the Park Police that the office be sealed.93  The Secret Service told Captain Hume that the office "had already been sealed or posted."94
<P>Major Robert Hines, Public Information Officer for the Park Police, received a telephone call at home at approximately 9:45 p.m. on July 20, 1993.95  He was told to call White House Deputy Chief of Staff William Burton to inform him of the discovery of Foster's body.  Major Hines recalls that in the course of his conversation with Burton, he asked Burton to "secure or lock" Foster's office.96  Sylvia Mathews recalled that Bill Burton "suggested that the office of Vincent Foster be locked" following a telephone conversation between Burton and the Park Police.97  She recalled "the general gist was that Mr. Nussbaum should lock the office."98  Indeed, the office suite was locked at 11:41 p.m.99
<P>It seems possible that Sergeant Braun intended to request of Watkins that Foster's office be secured, but neglected to do so in the confusion of events.  It also seems possible that she did make the request, but that Watkins did not hear it or register it in the confusion.  A further possibility is that Watkins heard and registered the request at the time but does not recall it.
<P>Far from treating the contents of Foster's office cavalierly, White House staff made independent efforts to preserve the contents of the office intact.  In July 1993, Sylvia Mathews worked for Robert Rubin, at that time Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.  After learning of Foster's death, it occurred to Mathews that the contents of Foster's trash can might be relevant to his death.100  She suggested that the contents should be retrieved, to which senior White House staff responded positively.101  Mathews retrieved the trash bag from Foster's office, brought it to the Chief of Staff's office for safekeeping, and made an inventory of the bag's contents, which were examined later.102  This action to preserve evidence regarding Foster's death was taken by the White House staff on their own initiative, without any request from the Park Police or any other agency.103  
<P>3.  Park Police Had No Authority to Review All Documents in Foster's Office

<P>On July 21, White House officials met with representatives of the Park Police and the Justice Department to discuss reviewing the contents of Foster's office.  The unanimous opinion of the law enforcement witnesses who appeared before the Committee was that neither the Park Police nor the Justice Department had the authority to enter or review documents in Vincent Foster's office.  In the view of Major Robert Hines, Public Information Officer for the Park Police, the Park Police would not have been able to obtain a search warrant for material in Foster's office "without any evidence of a crime being committed."104  Park Police Detective Markland testified, "we were not under the assumption that we had the absolute right to enter the office."105  Captain Hume testified that he shared Detective Markland's view.106
<P>Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann testified that the Justice Department could not have obtained a search warrant or a subpoena for items in Foster's office because no crime had been committed.107  "I would have thought that we did not have the basis for saying that there should be a grand jury to investigate a crime and issue subpoenas."108  Similarly, Heymann testified the Park Police "lacked probable cause for a search" of Foster's office.109
<P>    a.  Park Police Were Interested Only in Documents Relevant to Foster's State of Mind
<P>In keeping with their limited authority, the Park Police never expressed a desire to review all documents in Vincent Foster's office.  To the contrary, their focus was much narrower.  All testimony before the Committee, both from the Park Police and other investigators and from the White House, indicated that the Park Police wished to examine Foster's office only for a suicide note or other personal documents that could shed light on Foster's state of mind.
<P>Sergeant Braun testified that in a typical suicide case, she would enter the victim's home "to look for information that would confirm that the suicide victim was despondent or had made prior attempts, anything that would help confirm our suspicions that it was, in fact, a suicide."110  The Park Police allowed Mrs. Foster to search the Foster home for a suicide note.111  When no note was found at the scene of Foster's death or in the Foster home, it occurred to Sergeant Braun that Foster might have left a suicide note at his office.
<P>While Sergeant Braun did not go to Foster's office herself, she indicated the type of documents she would have been looking for:
<P>If it had been myself, I would have been looking for a note, basically, that says I couldn't go on any longer or something to the effect that he had committed suicide.  I would be also looking for insurance papers, things to show that he had his life in order and was ready to hand over to his family.  I would have been looking for a journal, a diary . . . an appointment book with maybe appointments with psychiatrists or something like that.  I would have been looking for things that would have helped confirm that this was a suicide.112

<P>Major Hines's explanation of the sort of material the Park Police would look for in Foster's office is in keeping with Sergeant Braun's description.  Major Hines stressed that the Park Police wanted to "examine" Foster's office rather than "search" it:
<P>I'll use `examination' as opposed to `search' because we're looking for limited information that might lead us to believe that his suicide -- to prove that he had intent.

<P>We would want to find out if there's a suicide note.  We would want to find out if there's anything there that he might have left that would give him a reason or show his state of mind.  We'd want to check his records and see if he had financial problems . . . items like this.113

<P>Park Police Detective Peter Markland was assigned on July 21, 1993 to investigate Foster's death.  He testified that when he arrived at the White House that day, expecting to review the contents of Foster's office, he was interested in seeing "anything that might support the physical evidence we had that indicated a suicide."114  Detective Markland conceded that the death of an attorney does not permit the police authority investigating that death to examine confidential client information in the attorney's files.115
<P>The White House staff present at the July 21 meeting made no objection to the Park Police's request.116  Nussbaum explained,
<P>The search was for a suicide note, an extortion note or some similar document which reflected depression or acute mental anguish.  That is the request law enforcement officials made of me.  They did not ask to read every piece of paper in Foster's office, every official White House record there, every personal file there to see if there was any indication of concern about any matter Vince had been working on.  I was not faced with a request for some general excursion through documents to determine Vince's state of mind about matters he was working on.117

<P>4.  Recollections Differ As to Whether Bernard Nussbaum Agreed that
<P>     Department of Justice Attorneys Would Review Foster's Documents

<P>The Committee heard divergent testimony about whether an agreement was reached on July 21, 1993 between Bernard Nussbaum on behalf of the White House and Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann on behalf of the Justice Department concerning the procedures for the review of the documents in Foster's office.  Department of Justice officials (Philip Heymann, David Margolis and Roger Adams) testified that Nussbaum agreed on July 21 that Margolis and Adams would review Foster's documents.  Nussbaum and staff of the White House Counsel's office testified that there was no such agreement.
<P>Heymann cannot recall how he entered into discussions regarding the role Department of Justice lawyers would play in the review of Foster's office.*118  
<P>Senator Kerry.  . . . You're unclear in your deposition as to how you initiated the first contact with the White House or they with you; is that correct?

<P>Mr. Heymann.  That is correct.

<P>Senator Kerry.  You're still unclear at this point in time?

<P>Mr. Heymann.  I'm still unclear -- let me get the right day.

<P>Senator Kerry.  The 21st, I think, was your first --

<P>Mr. Heymann.  By the end of the 21st, I know that we have an understanding as to how the search of Mr. Foster's office will be done.

<P>Senator Kerry.  How many conversations did it take to reach that understanding?

<P>Mr. Heymann.  That's what I can't remember.  And I can't remember whether -- how many of them are conversations between me and Margolis and Adams which are then carried over to conversations between them and Mr. Nussbaum and others, and how many of them are direct conversations between me and Mr. Nussbaum.  I know that I must have talked to somebody in the White House to make arrangements that Adams and Margolis are going to go over and represent us and why they were going.

<P>Senator Kerry.  Do you have a specific recollection as to at least one conversation with Mr. Nussbaum?

<P>Mr. Heymann.  I think that I talked to Mr. Nussbaum that day about it, but I wouldn't bet -- I wouldn't bet $500 on it.

<P>Senator Kerry.  On what do you base the notion, then, that you had an agreement or an understanding?

<P>Mr. Heymann.  Well, besides the fact that I believe that Mr. Nussbaum and I had that conversation and agreed, both Margolis and Adams returned that evening from having met with the White House people.  They described the same agreement as having been reached . . .119
<P>
Heymann cannot remember whether he reached this agreement with Nussbaum, or whether Margolis and Adams reached this agreement with Nussbaum:  "I don't remember whether it was directly or through them . . .120  
<P>Nevertheless, Heymann recalled that he understood that the Justice Department lawyers would mediate the issue of investigators' access to documents between the Park Police and the White House.121  He recalled that Margolis and Adams would review the documents:
<P>The understanding was that they would see, these two senior prosecutors, not the investigators, but the prosecutors would see enough of every document to be able to determine whether it was relevant to the investigation or not.122

<P>Heymann testified he did not believe Nussbaum had committed irrevocably to such a procedure:
<P>I didn't feel that I had a binding commitment by Mr. Nussbaum or anyone else.  We simply all had talked about it by then and we all were on the same track, we all were on the same page, we all thought it would be done [that] way . . .123
<P>
He explained further:

<P>I don't like calling it an agreement [because] I would have felt perfectly comfortable the next day calling up Mr. Nussbaum and saying, you know what we talked about yesterday, I don't think that's adequate, I think we have to do more.124

<P>...I had no problem at all with his changing his mind the next day.  I didn't think he had promised in a sense that kept him from changing his mind . . .125

<P>Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis recalled that on July 21, 1993, Heymann asked him to go to the White House with Adams in connection with the investigation of Vincent Foster's death.126  Margolis recalled that Heymann "said that he had reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Nussbaum that Roger and I were to go through at least the first page or two of each document in order to determine whether they were relevant to our investigation."127
<P>Phil told me that he believed he'd had an agreement in principle with Bernie Nussbaum to do it that way, so I should go finalize it and then begin the search process.128

<P>Margolis and Adams met with Nussbaum on July 21 to discuss the procedures that would be used to review the documents in Foster's office.  Margolis testified that during his meeting with Nussbaum on July 21, 1993, "we finalized that agreement, and . . . we both agreed to it."129  Adams testified:
<P>The purpose of the discussion was to go over the ground rules under which the search would be conducted.  The discussion lasted, as best I can recall, 10 or 15 minutes, maybe 20.  First thing we agreed on was that because of the lateness of the hour and people from the White House having been through considerable strain the night before . . . that it not take place that day, that it go over until the next day.  There was no disagreement on that point.

<P>There then ensued a fairly brief discussion about how the search should be conducted.  The gist of the discussion was that Mr. Margolis and myself, together with Mr. Nussbaum, would examine at least the outside of each file to determine, first of all, relevance to the suicide investigation, and, if it were deemed relevant, to then address issues of possible privilege.

<P>I think the understanding was just about as I have described it, that Mr. Margolis and I together with Mr. Nussbaum would make this very cursory review of at least the title or possibly the first page of each file.130
<P>
Adams conceded, however, that he didn't know "what was in Mr. Nussbaum or Mr. Neuwirth's mind."131
<P>The possibility that there was no agreement reached between the Justice Department and the White House Counsel's office is raised by the fact that at this very meeting, Assistant White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth stated that Nussbaum alone would review the documents.  Margolis testified:
<P>When we finished, Mr. Neuwirth on his staff, as I recall, attempted to restate the agreement, and got it what I believe was exactly wrong, and said, `The way we're going to do it is that Bernie will go through the documents, and he'll give you what is both relevant and non-privileged to review,' and I said that that's exactly wrong.  We just agreed to the other procedure.  And . . . Mr. Nussbaum agreed with me that Mr. Neuwirth was wrong, and that we had that other agreement.132
<P>
Adams's testimony was similar:

<P>After this agreement was reached, Mr. Neuwirth, either attempting to summarize the agreement or to change the terms of the agreement, made a statement to the effect okay, Bernie will examine each file and Bernie will determine issues of relevance and privilege.

<P>He was immediately corrected, I think, by Mr. Margolis, and we restated the agreement, as we had agreed to, which was namely that Mr. Margolis and I would examine the title or the first page of each file to determine issues of relevance and privilege.133

<P>Contrary to the testimony of the Department of Justice officials, the White House Counsel's office staff testified clearly that no agreement was reached on July 21 that Margolis and Adams would review the documents.  Nussbaum testified,
<P>One option we discussed on July 21 was the possibility of allowing Justice Department lawyers to look at a portion of each document to see if it was privileged.  I said -- I did say I would consider that option.  I did not say I would agree to it.134

<P>Nussbaum was clear that no agreement was reached with Margolis and Adams on July 21:
<P>Senator Shelby.  When you broke up the meeting, did you have an agreement?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  No.

<P>Senator Shelby.  Well, what did you have?  Why would they leave?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  We had an issue which had remained unresolved and which we agreed to meet the next morning to have further discussions.  That is my memory.135
<P>
Nussbaum said, "we agreed a search would be conducted the next day, and we would conclude the next day as to how the search would be conducted."136
<P>Neuwirth testified regarding the discussion on July 21,
<P>. . . Mr. Nussbaum indicated that one of the ways that an accommodation could be reached that would not undermine the privileges or cause a waiver of the privileges would be for Mr. Nussbaum to be the person who would review the contents of the documents and describe them to law enforcement officials.

<P>I think that from the first time we discussed this, Mr. Margolis expressed a different view. . . . I think that Mr. Margolis suggested that it would be in the best interest of the White House to let Mr. Margolis play the type of role that Mr. Nussbaum suggested that he himself should play in the review.137
<P>
Neuwirth was certain that there was no agreement:

<P>Mr. Ben-Veniste.  To the best of your recollection, what was Mr. Nussbaum's response to [Mr. Margolis's suggestion] on the 21st?

<P>Mr. Neuwirth.  That he didn't agree that that was a procedure that necessarily could work because having the Justice Department play that role could cause the very type of waiver that the accommodation was meant to avoid.

<P>Mr. Ben-Veniste.  And to the best of your recollection, how was the matter left then on the 21st?

<P>Mr. Neuwirth.  It was left without resolution with the understanding that there would be further discussion about it.138

<P>. . . I certainly, during that meeting and at any other time, did not understand there to have been an agreement and, in fact, thought that the disagreement between Mr. Margolis and Mr. Nussbaum was quite clear throughout all of these discussions.139

<P>My vivid recollection is that Mr. Margolis and Mr. Nussbaum disagreed about the best option to pursue under the circumstances.140
<P>
Sloan and Quinn also did not recall an agreement being reached on July 21st.141
<P>Nussbaum recalled that he told Margolis and Adams,
<P>. . . this is a lawyer's office.  There is sensitive materials in that office. [sic] There's confidential stuff, there is privileged stuff in that office. . . . I have obligations as a lawyer . . . as counsel to the President in his official capacity. . . that affect me as a government lawyer, as well as the same kind of obligations when I was a private lawyer.  I got to work out some way of dealing with these issues with you.  I just cannot let you go in and open the door and look at every document in the office.142

<P>They said we understand it, Bernie, we understand, you know, that you have these obligations as counsel to the President, as a government lawyer, you have these obligations because these obligations apply also to a government lawyer, but they said, maybe we can work something out.143
<P>
The White House Counsel's office was concerned that allowing the Justice Department attorneys to review Foster's documents directly could constitute a waiver of privileges attaching to those documents.144  Nussbaum explained these concerns for the Committee:
<P>As White House Counsel, I was . . . concerned with maintaining the credibility of federal law enforcement, but I was bound to act in accordance with my obligations as a lawyer, and I did not believe that doing so . . . would undermine the credibility of federal law enforcement.  It was my ethical duty as a lawyer and as White House Counsel to protect a client's information and confidences and not to disclose them without a prior review by me.  It was my duty to preserve the right of the White House, of this President and future Presidents to assert executive privilege, attorney-client privilege and work product privilege.  It was my duty to do nothing that could result in an inadvertent waiver of these privileges.  It was my duty to protect the confidentiality of other matters as well, including sensitive government documents in that office.145
<P>
Nussbaum said, "By the next day [July 22], I had determined that this [the procedure suggested by the Justice Department] would create an unacceptable risk of disclosure of confidences and an equal unacceptable risk of waiver of the privileges I was obligated to protect."146
<P>5.  The Difference of Opinion between Senior Justice Department Officials and
<P>     White House Counsel Reflected Differing Judgments about Appearances
<P>     Rather Than about Legal Rights

<P>Margolis and Adams testified that when they arrived at the White House on the morning of July 22, 1993, Nussbaum told them he had changed the procedures for the document review, and that only he would examine the documents for relevance and privilege.147  Margolis and Adams expressed their opinion that "he was making a mistake."148  They did not believe that Nussbaum was mistaken as a matter of law; as Adams told the Committee, "I don't think we had any legal tool that we could have pulled out and demanded to see the documents right there."149
<P>While Margolis believed that he had more experience than Nussbaum in reviewing documents in connection with a criminal investigation, he was largely concerned about the appearance of impartiality.150  Margolis testified:
<P>We were very concerned as how this would appear to the public in terms of law enforcement, and in terms of whether we were running a credible investigation.  And -- God forbid, but appearances being one thing, if we weren't running a credible investigation regardless of appearances, if we missed something because of the way we were doing it, there could be all hell to pay.  So it was very important to us, both in terms of perceptions and fact.151

<P>Margolis's and Adams's concern about appearances was consistent with the views of Heymann, who told the Committee,
<P>I believed then . . . that there was one central question. . . who should determine what documents would be made available to the investigators. . . . I thought that for the White House counsel's office to make these decisions largely by itself, as it did, was simply not an acceptable way of addressing them.152

<P>The federal law enforcement authorities have a responsibility to assure a process that credibly promises objectivity when high officials are part of the investigation.  To keep this promise of objectivity, even in a case that showed all the early signs of being a suicide, the White House counsel could not be the one to decide what documents would be shown to the investigators and which would be retained or distributed as irrelevant to the investigation or as privileged despite potential usefulness to the investigation.153
<P>
Heymann also testified that the procedure followed by Nussbaum was legal and ethical.154  In letting the investigators into Foster's office at all, Nussbaum was, in Heymann's view, "going beyond what could be legally required of the White House counsel."155  Heymann testified further that Nussbaum's procedures did not obstruct the investigation of Foster's death.156
<P>At Margolis's suggestion, Nussbaum spoke by telephone with Heymann.  Heymann recalled
<P>being very angry and very adamant and saying this is a bad -- this is a bad mistake, this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going to do it that way because they would have no useful function.157
<P>
Heymann recalled that Nussbaum responded, "I'll have to talk to somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll get back to you, Phil."158  Heymann testified, "I had obviously shaken him enough that he wanted to consider whether he should come back to what we had agreed to the day before on the 21st, but there were other people involved that he had to talk to about that."159  
<P>Nussbaum did not recall Heymann telling him he was making a mistake.160  Nussbaum also did not recall that he was to call Heymann back following his discussions with others.161
<P>Margolis recalled that Nussbaum "was obviously concerned about the arguments we would make, and he said he wanted to think about them before he reached a final decision."162  Adams also recalled Nussbaum "said he was considering whether to allow us to see the documents..."163
<P>Following these discussions with Heymann, Margolis and Adams, Nussbaum met with Bruce Lindsey, Jack Quinn, Bill Burton and Steven Neuwirth.  Nussbaum recalled that Quinn urged that he not even allow the law enforcement officials into Foster's office:
<P>I was urged by one senior White House official, Jack Quinn. . . not to permit law enforcement agents to enter Vince Foster's office at all.  Jack was not concerned about particular documents or files.  We never had a discussion about any sensitive matter.  Jack was concerned and properly concerned about setting an unfortunate precedent for the future and the institutional need of the White House to preserve confidentiality, concerns I shared.164

<P>Lindsey recalled that Nussbaum was trying to devise a procedure to accommodate the request of the Park Police to look for either a suicide note or some evidence of Foster's state of mind "with the need for protecting documents that could either be covered by one of several privileges -- executive privilege, attorney-client privilege, and so forth."165  Lindsey stated "the purpose of the meeting was to try to balance their needs so that they could feel that their purpose was served and yet still protect the privileges." 166  Lindsey testified the White House officials were not concerned about particular files that might be in Foster's office:
<P>Senator Kerry.  Let me ask you directly, Mr. Lindsey.  Was there any discussion there among those present about any issues of embarrassment or liability or questions that you somehow felt were of particular concern?

<P>Mr. Lindsey.  Absolutely not.  It was simply a question of the legal principles involved.167
<P>
Lindsey concluded that Nussbaum "decided on a procedure that he thought would accommodate both the Park Police's need and the privilege issue."168
<P>Michael Spafford, attorney for the Foster family, recalled that Nussbaum 
<P>was concerned that if he showed any of the documents to one of the investigators it may be construed as a waiver of that privilege.  He also said there may be personal documents in there which may raise personal issues . . .169
<P>
Spafford recalled no discussion of Whitewater documents or Travel Office documents.170
<P>Nussbaum explained for the Committee the difficult issues associated with waiver of legal privileges:
<P>You cannot just partially disclose a portion of a document or of a conversation without waiving not only the entire conversation as to the entire document, but indeed perhaps as to the entire subject matter covered by this document.  In other words, there may be other documents covering this subject matter, there may be other communications covering this subject matter.  So when you waive is a tricky thing, and two, how much you're waiving is even trickier at times.  That's what a lawyer thinks about when he's faced with a request for somebody to look at a part of or the first page of various documents.  And I was extremely concerned about that at the time.171

<P>When the law enforcement officials and White House officials assembled in Foster's office on the afternoon of July 22, Nussbaum explained that he would attempt to balance the interests of the White House and those of the law enforcement personnel investigating Foster's death.  Nussbaum recalled he "decided I was not going to keep law enforcement officials out of Vince's office.  I chose a middle ground.  I chose a procedure that balanced and accommodated the interest of confidentiality and law enforcement interest."172  ". . . I didn't think it was necessary to bar the door to Foster's office in order to adequately protect our rights, the right to protect confidentiality and privilege and to preserve the right to protect privilege and law enforcement  issues."173
<P>6.  Park Police Expressed No Interest in Reviewing Foster's Substantive Files

<P>According to Sloan, Nussbaum went through Foster's files, giving a "general description" of each to the law enforcement personnel assembled in the office.174  No Park Police, FBI or Department of Justice officials ever requested that they be allowed to search the Clintons' personal files to determine if they had any influence on Foster's state of mind:
<P>Senator Kerry. . . . Did you say these are personal files of the Clintons'?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  Yes.

<P>Senator Kerry. . . . Did they ask to see any of those files?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  No, sir.

<P>Senator Kerry.  At no time did they ask to see those?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  At no time did they ask to see any of those files.

<P>Senator Kerry.  Did they ask them to be set aside for further review at a later time?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  They did not, Senator.175

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified,

<P>No one said to me, `Mr. Nussbaum, we want to look through all the files.  We want to read every document.  We want to see every matter Vince Foster was working on, personal -- we want to see every Clinton personal file, because we want to determine the state of mind.  We want to see if there's any potential scandal.  We want to see what might have driven him to this thing.'  No one -- there was no basis for that -- no one made that suggestion.  It was a search . . . for a suicide note.176

<P>The Park Police never requested that any of the Clinton personal files be set aside for review during or after the review of documents in Foster's office as evidence of Foster's state of mind.177  Adams testified that had he known Foster's office contained "things like tax returns and personal financial information of the Clintons," he "would have assumed they didn't have much to do with a suicide investigation."178  He said
<P>we had little interest -- or no interest, I should say -- in anything that didn't appear to be relevant to a suicide investigation, such as a note or evidence that Mr. Foster was being blackmailed, evidence that he was a victim of a crime, something like that, something that would explain why a man like Mr. Foster would take his own life.179

Adams noted that in July 1993 he was not familiar with the name Whitewater and that a Whitewater file would have meant nothing to him.180
<P>Margolis himself testified, "the President's personal papers I was not concerned with."181  According to Margolis, the Park Police were narrowly focused on material setting forth Foster's state of mind, such as a suicide note or an extortion threat."182  Margolis testified
<P>if Mr. Nussbaum had showed me a bunch of financial documents that day, I wouldn't have been very interested in them, I wouldn't have understood them, I don't think my agents would have had any interest in them.183

Heymann was also quite clear that the investigators were not interested in files pertaining to the Clintons' tax returns or real estate investments.184  "They would have been prepared to treat them as not relevant to Vince Foster's death."185
<P>    a.   No Instructions Were Conveyed to Bernard Nussbaum Regarding Documents in
<P><P>   Foster's Office

<P>Susan Thomases, a partner in the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, has known President Clinton for over 20 years and Mrs. Clinton for nearly 20 years.  During the 1992 Presidential campaign, she lived in Little Rock for six months while serving as director of scheduling and advance for the Clinton/Gore campaign.
<P>On the night of July 20, Mrs. Clinton called Thomases at her apartment in New York and told her of Foster's suicide.186  They shared their grief at the loss of their close friend and colleague.  Thomases informed Mrs. Clinton that, in keeping with her long-standing practice of traveling to Washington on Wednesdays to conduct business, she was planning to travel to Washington the following afternoon.187  Thomases recalled that Mrs. Clinton then
<P>said, would you please find out when my husband, the President, is going to be there and please be sure to see him; and, also please be sure to talk to Maggie Williams to see if she were okay.188
<P>
Mrs. Clinton did not suggest that Thomases change her plans so as to arrive in Washington earlier.189  Asked whether the contents of Foster's office came up in that conversation, Thomases replied, "Absolutely not."190
<P>Telephone records indicate that Thomases made a series of telephone calls to Williams, Nussbaum and McLarty, or their offices, on July 21 and 22, 1993.  At 12:15 a.m. on July 21, Thomases paged Williams.  Williams called Thomases at 1:10 a.m.; they spoke for fourteen minutes.  Thomases recalled that, in their first conversation after Foster's suicide, Williams told her that she and Thomasson had been in Foster's office.191  There was no discussion of Foster's documents.  Williams testified, in her deposition and before the Committee, that she did not recall speaking with Thomases by telephone during that week, but did recall Thomases coming by her office in person.192  
<P>On July 22, Williams called the Rodham residence in Arkansas, where the First Lady was staying, at 7:44 a.m. and spoke for one minute.  Williams did not recall whether she spoke to Mrs. Clinton at that time.193  She does not recall discussing Whitewater with the First Lady in connection with Foster's death, nor discussing Foster's documents other than regarding moving documents to the residence.194  A three-minute call was placed from the Rodham residence to Thomases's hotel in Washington at 7:57 that morning.  Thomases did not recall the details of the conversation; she speculated that Mrs. Clinton may have asked her about her conversation with the President, whom she had seen the day before, and that they may have discussed Thomases's decision not to attend Foster's funeral.195  Thomases does not recall discussing Foster's documents or Whitewater with the First Lady on July 22.196  
<P>Thomases paged Nussbaum at 8:01 that morning.  She called the Rodham residence, where Mrs. Clinton was staying, at 8:25 am. Thomases left a message for Williams at the White House at 9:00 a.m.  Thomases called the First Lady's office in the White House at 11:04 a.m. for six minutes, at 11:37 a.m. for 11 minutes, at 11:50 a.m. for four minutes, and at 3:08 p.m. for 10 minutes.  These calls were made to Mrs. Clinton's general office telephone number, rather than to Williams's direct line.197  Thomases called McLarty's office at 9:30 a.m. to leave a message for Burton, at 10:48 a.m. for three minutes, at 11:11 a.m. for three minutes, and at 11:16 a.m. for one minute.  
<P>The records do not indicate how many conversations Thomases had, nor with whom.  Thomases does not recall the conversations and does not believe she reached McLarty on any of those occasions.198  

<P>. . . I was reaching out for Mack and I was anxious to speak to him because he had a very special relationship with Vince, and I wanted to talk to him.  And unfortunately I do not believe that I was able, nor can I remember, that I was able to reach him that day.199
<P>
 McLarty also did not recall receiving any telephone calls from Thomases and did not recall speaking with her on July 22.200  Burton recalled that at one point he spoke with Thomases regarding travel arrangements to a funeral; he could not recall if it was to Foster's funeral or that of President Clinton's mother.201  
<P>Thomases recalled speaking with Nussbaum on the morning of July 22 and described her motivation for doing so:
<P>I was not looking for . . . Bernie Nussbaum to talk about the review of documents in Vince Foster's office.  I was really trying to reach him to talk about how he was feeling and how he was doing.  I had known that he and Vince had grown to be very good friends and that it was a very difficult thing for him to have lost his trusted deputy at this particular time.  I was really calling to check in with my friend to see how he was doing.202
<P>
According to Thomases, Nussbaum himself raised the subject of the review of documents in Foster's office:
<P>He told me he had made a decision and that he was in charge, and that he was going to do it, and that he had taken great care into thinking through how it was going to be divided up; and that other people were going to be there, and the proper documents were going to be given to the proper person.203
<P>
She did not express to him a view that the investigators' ability to review the documents should be limited.204  At the time of her conversation with Nussbaum, she "had not heard about any issue in the White House" regarding investigators' access to Foster's office.
<P>Nussbaum recalled mentioning the review of documents with Thomases but noted, "I didn't even discuss with her, I don't believe, exactly how it should be done."205  Nussbaum testified,
<P>I talked to a number of people about this issue as to how the search for a suicide note should be conducted.  But I did not speak to the President or the First Lady about this matter, nor did Susan Thomases or anyone else convey a message to me from either of them.  Susan Thomases did not discuss the First Lady's views with me . . .206
<P>
Thomases did not mention the President or the First Lady during the conversation.207

<P>Senator Boxer.  . . . Did the First Lady personally tell you how to handle the papers in the office?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  No.

<P>Senator Boxer.  Did she tell you what to do through Susan Thomases?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  No.

<P>Senator Boxer.  Did she tell you what to do through any other intermediary?

<P>Mr. Nussbaum.  No.208

<P>Neuwirth stated that, around the time of the review of documents in Foster's office, Nussbaum mentioned a conversation he had had with Thomases.209  Neuwirth stated his "understanding was that Nussbaum felt that Thomases and the First Lady may have been concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."210  Nussbaum did not indicate to Neuwirth whether Thomases had spoken with Mrs. Clinton.211  Nussbaum does not recall these conversations with Neuwirth.212
<P>Thomases testified specifically that she did not act as an intermediary for Mrs. Clinton with Nussbaum on this occasion.213  She testified she was unaware of the meeting on July 22 between Messrs. Nussbaum, Lindsey, Burton, Quinn and Neuwirth regarding the review of Foster's documents and did not call in an attempt to influence that decision.214  She explained her 8:01 a.m. page to Nussbaum:
<P>I don't remember making that call, but I want to put it in a context where I think it was.  I had not yet talked to Bernie who was my very close friend.  His deputy, Vince Foster, had shot himself.  I wanted to know how Bernie was doing because he had been working with Vince day in and day out and he had been feeling very good about how things were going and then his deputy goes out and kills himself.215

She did not pass on to him any information regarding how he should handle the Park Police request for access to Foster's office.216  Nussbaum agreed:
<P>I know Hillary Clinton for over 20 years now . . . and in the White House we had quite a good relationship...  [She] and I have talked on many occasions in our lives.  If Hillary Clinton wants to say something to me, she says it to me. . . . If she wants to deliver me a message, Hillary Clinton delivers me a message herself.  If I want to deliver her a message, I deliver her a message myself.  She doesn't need any messengers to deliver messages between her and myself.217

<P>Thomases saw President Clinton at the White House on July 21; during that conversation they shared their sadness at Foster's death.218  Asked whether there was any discussion of the contents of Foster's office during that conversation, Thomases replied, "None whatsoever."219
<P>Williams did not recall whether she actually spoke with Thomases on any of the occasions when Thomases called her office on July 21 and 22.220  Williams recalled that Thomases came by her office during that time.221  Thomases recalled speaking to Williams on both July 21 and July 22.222  Thomases recalled clearly she "had no conversation with Maggie Williams about Vince Foster's papers."223  She stated, 
<P>I can imagine myself talking to Maggie at length.  Maggie was very upset by Vince's death, and I thought of her often on the 22nd.  I could have called and talked to her.  I could have called and talked to Evelyn [Lieberman] to find out how she was doing.  Any of those things could have caused me to call that . . . number.  But I wasn't calling Maggie Williams about any papers.224

<P>I talked to her about how she was holding up.  I talked to her about going to the funeral.  I talked to her about how I was holding up.  I talked to her about how much work I had and how pressured I was feeling at the time.225

<P>Thomases told the Committee:

<P>I never received from anyone or gave to anyone any instructions about how the review of Vince Foster's office was to be conducted or how the files in Vince's office were to be handled.226
<P>
She had no conversation with Mrs. Clinton regarding the documents in Foster's office.227  
<P>I'm absolutely firm that had [Mrs. Clinton] discussed documents with me at this time, I would have noticed it.  It would have been a memorable thing for her to have mentioned because we were talking about emotions, children, religion, feelings, friendship; and had she brought up documents, it would have been so distinct I believe I would have remembered it.228
<P>
She testified again, "I remember no discussions about documents with either Mrs. Clinton or Maggie Williams.  The only person who discussed documents with me during that period was Bernie Nussbaum."229.
<P>7.  Park Police Investigation Was Not Hindered by Nussbaum's Review of Foster
<P>     Documents

<P>The document review procedures employed by Nussbaum did not impede the Park Police's investigation of Vincent Foster's death.  Nussbaum provided the law enforcement officials on July 22 with a general description of the documents.  The law enforcement officials were able, on that date or shortly thereafter, to review and copy all documents in which they expressed an interest.
<P>Witnesses agree that Nussbaum separated the documents in Foster's office into piles, although there are differing recollections as to how many piles and what the piles represented.  Margolis and Adams recalled that one pile was material to be redistributed within the White House Counsel's Office, a second pile was personal material of Foster's to be provided to the Foster family's lawyer, and a third pile was personal material of President and Mrs. Clinton to be provided to their private lawyer.230
<P>Nussbaum testified,
<P>As I went through the files in Vince Foster's office, the agents did . . . ask to see and read certain documents.  I set those documents aside.  Subsequently, after we reviewed them, every document the agents asked for was, within a matter of days, given to the law enforcement officials.231

<P>Sloan explained that as Nussbaum provided a general description of the documents, the law enforcement officials identified particular items in which they were interested.232  Neuwirth confirmed that "there was an opportunity during the review for the law enforcement officials to identify documents or categories of documents that they wanted to see."233  In fact, Nussbaum specifically told Sloan to make the documents available to the Park Police.234  Nussbaum allowed the Park Police to make copies of those documents.235  Neuwirth and Sloan were both of the understanding that following the review, all of the documents that had been requested were made available to the law enforcement officials who had requested them.236  In fact, Margolis recalled that Nussbaum gave some documents to the Park Police on the spot, including Foster's calendar and a map of the Washington area that had been in Foster's possession.237
<P>Captain Hume testified that the Park Police reviewed the materials that Nussbaum removed from Foster's office and provided to Foster's attorney.238  On July 30 he reviewed the documents remaining in the White House Counsel's office that the investigators had identified as of interest to them, including Foster's telephone logs.  Captain Hume testified,  "[f]rom those phone logs, we were able to get the phone number for his doctor. . . . I was able to talk to his doctor and confirm that he was ill."239  Captain Hume reviewed all the documents in which he had an interest.240  Asked about White House Counsel's office attorneys attending Park Police interviews of the White House Counsel's office staff, Captain Hume testified, "the end result is all the questions that I asked got responses so there was no interference."241
<P>When the document review was completed, none of the law enforcement officials present expressed any concern about the movement of the Clinton personal documents out of the White House Counsel's suite; they had not expressed any interest in reviewing any of those documents.242  After Foster's note, which refers to the Travel Office matter, was turned over to the Park Police, no law enforcement officials asked for documents in Foster's office relating to the Travel Office matter.243
<P>Whatever opinions can be formed regarding the way in which White House officials responded to the Park Police's request to examine Foster's office for a suicide note or other evidence of his state of mind, it is clear that the investigation of his death was not hindered.  Major Hines told the Committee, "we had a thorough enough investigation to determine that it was a suicide."244  Margolis testified quite clearly that the procedures determined by Nussbaum did not hinder the Park Police investigation of Foster's death.  Instead, Margolis was concerned about the appearance created by those procedures, not about their impact on the investigation itself.
<P>Senator Shelby.  Do you believe, Mr. Margolis, that the conduct of the White House Counsel in setting the ground rules of the so-called search, later dispersing papers and so forth, without the Justice Department having an opportunity to evaluate them, compromised or contaminated the investigation?

<P>Mr. Margolis.  I can't say that Senator.  What I would say --

<P>Senator Shelby.  What would you say?

<P>Mr. Margolis.  I would say, and I think Mr. Heymann said it perfectly --

<P>Senator Shelby.  Okay.

<P>Mr. Margolis.  -- that the way this was done -- and I don't think I can capture his exact words --

<P>Senator Shelby.  Okay.

<P>Mr. Margolis.  But the way this was done, it managed to cast substantial doubt on the bona fides of the investigation with no evidence that anything wrong was ever done.245

<P>8.  The Torn Note Is Found in Foster's Briefcase

<P>    a.  Nussbaum Overlooked the Note in Foster's Briefcase on July 22

<P>In the course of reviewing the documents in Foster's office, Nussbaum removed files from Foster's briefcase, which was propped against a wall.  Nussbaum testified he did not open the briefcase and look inside after he had removed the files.246  He said, "I remember just simply pulling the files out, realizing, or feeling in effect, or looking, glancing, that the files were all out and then, as you can see, the briefcase apparently sort of shuts by itself."247
<P>Bill Burton stood behind Nussbaum during the review of Foster's documents.  When Nussbaum removed the files from Foster's briefcase, Burton was able to see inside.248  He testified, 
<P>I saw that . . . Mr. Nussbaum had taken all the files out of the briefcase and that the briefcase otherwise looked empty to me, like your briefcase might look empty or my briefcase might look empty after you've taken all the files out.  There was litter in the bottom of the briefcase, paper clips, a Post-it note . . .249

<P>There was nothing in me that made me think at the time perhaps we should see if there's a note tucked away in that litter.250

<P>Witnesses differed in their recollections as to whether Nussbaum looked in the empty briefcase.  Margolis recalled he "was satisfied that [Mr. Nussbaum] had looked in the briefcase and had represented to us that there was nothing else in there."251  Spafford did not recall whether Nussbaum looked inside the briefcase.252  Agent Salter also did not see Nussbaum look inside the briefcase.253  While Margolis "cannot absolutely swear that [he] remember[s] him looking in the briefcase," he believes Nussbaum did look in the briefcase.254
<P>Detective Markland testified Nussbaum looked in the briefcase:
<P>When Mr. Nussbaum concluded the emptying of the briefcase, he looked in it, said that's it; it's empty.  He again looked at it, actually picked it up and looked into the briefcase, set it down on the floor, and it was pushed to the wall behind him.255
<P>
Margolis testified, though, that based on where people were sitting in the office Detective 
<P>
Markland could not have seen whether Nussbaum looked in the briefcase: "I don't see how he 
<P>
[Markland] could have seen into the briefcase in those circumstances."256

<P>Captain Hume testified in his deposition that Nussbaum 

<P>never took that briefcase and spread it open and looked down at it like I would or you would now in retrospect if we thought something was in there.  That never happened. . . . I can tell you at no point do I remember him picking that briefcase up and pulling it out like I would, like I looked in it when I went back up there the following week or whatever, after we had gotten the call about the note.

Senator Sarbanes read Captain Hume's deposition to him at the Committee's hearing and asked him, "is that still your recollection today of what took place?"257  Captain Hume replied, "That's correct, Senator, that's still my recollection."  
<P>Spafford testified that after the investigators had left Foster's office, Sloan noticed pieces of paper in the bottom of the briefcase.  Spafford recalled that "Mr. Sloan had the briefcase in his hand...and he made the comment at that point in time that there appeared to be scraps in the bottom of the briefcase."258  Spafford recalled that Nussbaum responded to the effect that other materials had to be reviewed as well and "we will look through that later."259  Spafford testified, "it was an off-the-cuff remark by Mr. Sloan to which I attached very little significance at the time, and it appeared that Nussbaum attached very little significance to it as well."260  To Spafford, Nussbaum "looked very tired, exhausted."261
<P>Sloan first learned of the pieces of paper on July 27; he believes that had the earlier incident occurred he would have recalled it when he learned of the note.262  He said, "as far as I am concerned, it did not happen because I don't remember anything remotely like that, and I believe that I would have recalled it the following week."263  Nussbaum also did not recall that conversation and believes it did not happen.264
<P>On July 26 Deborah Gorham, Foster's secretary, "picked up" Foster's briefcase "at which time [she] moved it from the corner of his desk to the front of his bar . . ."265  Inside the briefcase she "saw the top of the cut of a third cut folder and the color of yellow."266  Gorham testified she saw "the color of yellow, not the form or shape or if there was writing on it or not."267  At Foster's request, Gorham had from time to time placed yellow Post-It notes in his briefcase for his use.268  Linda Tripp, Nussbaum's secretary, recalled Gorham said to her
<P>either `it was empty' or `there's nothing in there' followed by `except for a bunch of little yellow sticky notes;" she may have said `at the bottom.'269
<P>
Gorham did not recall this conversation.270  However, she believes she may have associated "something yellow" with the yellow Post-It notes she placed in the briefcase.271
<P>Even if the scraps of yellow paper were brought to Nussbaum's attention on July 22, none of the individuals who saw them concluded that they may have been evidence of Foster's state of mind; none of them suggested to Nussbaum that they might be a suicide note.272
<P>Neuwirth testified that he found the scraps of paper on July 26:
<P>On Monday the 26th at Mr. Nussbaum's request I was preparing an inventory of the contents of Mr. Foster's office.  One of the things that I did in connection with that inventory was to put into a box towards the latter part of my inventory process items that belonged to Mr. Foster personally, like photographs.  And in the process of putting materials in that box I saw the briefbag leaning against the back wall of Mr. Foster's office.  I understood it to be empty.  I knew that it belonged to Mr. Foster.  I picked it up and brought it to put into the box.  I had laid two large -- one or two or maybe even three large black and white photographs of Mr. Foster and his daughter with the President on the top of the box, and in an effort to avoid damaging those photographs, I turned the . . . briefbag to fit into the box, and in the process of turning it, scraps of paper fell out of the brief bag.273
<P>
Upon discovering what appeared to be Foster's handwriting on them, Neuwirth "looked in the bag to see if there were other scraps of paper because only a few had fallen out, and I saw that there were more scraps of paper at the bottom of the bag.  I had to stick my hand into the bag to scoop many of them out . . ."274  Neuwirth brought the pieces of paper to the conference table in Nussbaum's office, where he assembled them into the note.275
<P>    b.  The Note Was Given to the Department of Justice the Day after It Was Found

<P>Upon hearing of the note, Nussbaum sought to inform McLarty; McLarty was with the President in Chicago Nussbaum informed Burton, who called McLarty.276  Nussbaum recalled
 <P>I waited a day to turn the list over because I believed then and I believe now that it was common decency to allow Lisa Foster to see the writing before it was turned over, to see it before it could be leaked or before it could be on national TV in some fashion.  Lisa saw it on the afternoon of July 27.  I thought it also appropriate that the President, who was out of town that day, have a chance to see it, if he wished, before it was turned over.  This one-day delay had no impact whatsoever on any investigation.277
<P>
Nussbaum called Mrs. Foster's attorney, James Hamilton, on July 26; Hamilton informed Mrs. Foster of the note that day or the next.278
<P>David Gergen similarly recalled that the White House staff hoped to accomplish two items before turning the note over to law enforcement:  
<P>one was to talk to the widow and to ensure that she felt comfortable . . . As I recall, she was on her way back that day from Arkansas and was not available until sometime in the afternoon. ...And the other precondition was to talk to the President and to make sure that he was comfortable with it, which he -- as I said at least in my first hearing, he wanted it turned over.  Obviously, if those two preconditions had been met earlier . . . it would have been better, but under the circumstances, that was the earliest we could get it all done.279

<P>Neuwirth told the Committee that his initial reaction upon finding Foster's writing was
<P>it was something that was appropriate to advise the investigators of immediately . . ."280  He recalled, "Mr. McLarty was very concerned . . . about being respectful to Mrs. Foster.  And I think in the conversation it pretty quickly came up that she was coming to Washington the next day, and an effort was being made to show her the note before it was turned over to any investigator so that, for example, she wouldn't read about it in the press before having seen it.281

<P>Neuwirth recalled that in the course of discussion regarding what to do with the note, "Mr. Burton raised the question of whether the fact that Foster was talking about matters on which he had worked in a note that was undated and made no reference to suicide, whether the contents of the note might be covered by attorney-client privilege."282  Burton recalled the discussion of whether any privilege attached to the note, but did not recall who raised the issue.283
<P>Nussbaum also called Thomases to tell her that a note had been found in Foster's briefcase.284  Thomases testified, ". . . I think he told me because he knew that I was very close to Vince, and I was very close to both the President and the First Lady."285  Thomases does not recall discussing with Nussbaum whether and how the note should be turned over to law enforcement officials.286  She also does not recall discussing the note with Mrs. Clinton.287  Nussbaum does not recall discussing the note with Thomases on July 26.288
<P>On July 27, 1993, Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General Heymann were asked to come to the White House.  They met with Nussbaum, McLarty, Burton, David Gergen, and Mark Gearan.  Heymann recalled that Nussbaum told him and Attorney General Reno of the discovery of the torn-up note:
<P>he said yesterday we found these, we found a torn-up note. . . . He had written down what the note said and he read us the note.  They wanted to know what we thought should be done with it.  The Attorney General said turn it over to the Park Police immediately.  She then asked why are we just getting it now if it was found I guess it's 30 hours -- it was 30 hours before then.

<P>The White House people, I don't know whether it was Mr. Nussbaum or who, said that there was -- they wanted first to show it to Mrs. Foster and they wanted to show it to the President who might, if he had wanted to, have asserted executive privilege, they said.289
<P>
The note was provided to the Park Police that night.
<P>Margolis testified "the delay of 27 hours, I don't see what practical significance that made.  What it did, once again, was it's the optics, you know, people then begin once again to question the bona fides."290
<P>Heymann then directed the FBI to investigate the circumstances regarding the discovery of the note.291  At the time, Heymann did not believe that misbehavior had occurred with respect to the discovery of the note; instead, he was concerned that the investigation appear to be impartial.292  FBI Agent Salter testified regarding the investigation by the FBI of the circumstances surrounding the note.  The FBI report concluded there was no evidence that the note was somewhere other than the bottom of Foster's briefcase on July 22, that there was no evidence to contradict Neuwirth's testimony that he discovered the note in the bottom of the briefcase on July 26, and that there was no evidence that any White House official attempted to conceal the note or its contents from the law enforcement personnel investigating Foster's death.293
<P>After it was provided to the Park Police, the Park Police spoke with Mrs. Foster regarding the note.  Captain Hume testified,
<P>She had stated to us that she had asked Mr. Foster to write down some of the things that were bothering him or troubling him and she believes he wrote that note about a week to a week and a half before his death.294

Mrs. Foster told the Park Police that when she looked at the note she was certain the note was in her husband's handwriting.295
<P>The fact that the note was found on July 26th rather than July 20th or 22nd made no difference to the Park Police's investigation of Foster's death.  The note does express Foster's concern regarding the Travel Office matter; however, this concern was known to the Park Police within hours of the discovery of Foster's body.  On the car ride to the Foster home, David Watkins told Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla that Foster had been upset about the Travel Office matter.296
<P>9.  Removing the Clintons' Personal Files from the White House Counsel's
<P>     Office Was Appropriate

<P>Following the review of documents in Foster's office, Nussbaum determined to provide the Clintons' personal files to their personal attorneys, Williams & Connolly:
<P>I knew that Vince had been assisting the First Family in completing financial disclosure statements, filing tax returns and creating a blind trust. . . . it is proper and indeed traditional for the White House Counsel's office to assist in that official function.  Mr. Foster needed access to the Clinton personal files for these official purposes. . . . I knew that the work on the projects for which the personal files were needed had recently been completed. . . . Shortly after the search of Vince's office was completed, I asked Maggie Williams . . . to help me transfer these files to the Clintons and to their personal lawyers.297

<P>I had just transferred the Foster personal files to the Foster personal lawyers.  I was anxious to get on with the work of my office.  I had told the Department of Justice . . .  that I was going to move the working files to other lawyers who would work on them.  It seemed the most natural thing in the world for me, at that point, having just transferred the Foster personal files, to now transfer the Clinton personal files.298

<P>Neither the Justice Department attorneys, Margolis and Adams, nor the Park Police investigators present during the document review objected to Nussbaum's intention to send the Clintons' personal files to their private attorneys; nor did they ask Nussbaum to prepare an index of those documents.  Nussbaum testified,
<P>Mr. Adams . . . understood that the Foster personal files were going to the Foster family lawyers.  Indeed, I handed those files to the Foster family lawyers right in front of the Justice Department.  No one asked me to make a log.  No asked me to make an index.  They were right there . . . they knew what was happening.299

<P>Margaret Williams recalled that Bernard Nussbaum indicated to her "that he was distributing the documents from Vince's office."300  Nussbaum asked her to deliver certain personal documents of President and Mrs. Clinton from Foster's office to their personal attorney:
<P>. . . on the afternoon of Thursday, July 22, the day before Vince Foster's funeral in Little Rock, I received a call from Bernie Nussbaum asking me to come to Vince's office and to take care of having the personal files of the President and Mrs. Clinton delivered to their personal lawyer, who was Bob Barnett of Williams & Connolly at the time.301

<P>Sometime shortly thereafter, Williams met Nussbaum in Foster's office.302  He directed her "to either a stack of files . . . or . . . to a box in which there were files" that he had already identified as personal files of President and Mrs. Clinton.303  She testified
<P>he asked me to take a look around -- eyeball -- the remaining files to see if there were any that should be included. . . . I did look because he asked me to, and I pulled out -- I saw a file that said `taxes' on it. . . . I picked it up and I put it on the table that had the other files that Nussbaum had directed me to take.304
<P>
Nussbaum did not indicate that the files contained documents related to Whitewater or to the White House Travel Office; the only file Williams recalled discussing with Nussbaum pertained to renovations of the White House residence.305
<P>Nussbaum recalled that Williams
<P>glanced at particular file folders, the titles, just to make sure, and she glanced in the area in which the Clinton personal files were which was in the credenza or some of them may have been pulled out of the credenza, just to see if there was anything, any obvious personal file that I overlooked.  She wasn't conducting a search or a review of any file...306

<P>Williams testified that later that afternoon, having attended to other matters in the meantime, she decided not to deliver the files to Barnett that day:
<P>I took several calls in my own office in the West Wing. . . . I know I had several telephone calls back and forth . . . So the day started getting a little later.  . . . I had finally made a determination that I was going to go to Vince's funeral the next day.  And, quite frankly, I was tired.  And when I thought about the time it would take . . . both to get a messenger, clear them in and actually have them get in and collect the box, I decided I could be at home in that time, and I decided that the sending and the waiting for someone to pick up the documents would have to wait until later.307

<P>Rather than leave the files in Foster's office or in her own office, Williams decided to put them in the White House residence.  She testified, "since Bernie Nussbaum had asked me to take care of the personal files, I felt as if I needed to place them somewhere."308  
<P>I was looking for both a way to accommodate Bernie Nussbaum's asking me to take the files, the personal files, and put them away, and to accommodate my wanting to leave there.  So I thought if I cannot get them to the personal lawyer . . . because of my own selfish reasons . . . I thought where else could I put them that would safeguard them, perhaps giving Bernie peace of mind, gave me peace of mind and I thought they're personal files, I'll put them in the residence.309

<P>Williams telephoned Mrs. Clinton and 

<P>told her that there were personal files that weren't going to get to the lawyer because I was just tired, and I was going to put them in the White House, in the residence, and where did she want them.310
<P>
Mrs. Clinton told Williams to call Carolyn Huber for guidance on where to put the box; Mrs. Clinton did not give Williams any further instructions regarding the files.311  Huber recalled that Williams called her "and said that Mr. Clinton had asked her to call me to take her -- she had a box of records to store.  She wanted me to take them to the residence on the third floor, where we have an office and we keep their personal records."312
<P>Williams recalled asking Thomas Castleton, an assistant in the White House Counsel's Office, to carry the box of files to the White House residence.313  Castleton recalled that he "volunteered to help carry the box."314  
<P>Castleton recalled that as they were walking to the White House residence, Williams told him the box "contained personal and financial records pertaining to the First Family and that we were moving the boxes to the residence for them to be reviewed."315  Williams does not recall telling Castleton that the documents had to go to the residence so that President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton could review their contents.316
<P>Neither Adams nor Margolis objected to Nussbaum's intention to send the Clintons' personal files to their personal attorneys following the document review.317  As Adams testified, "there would be nothing impermissible with the President or Mrs. Clinton looking at the files pertaining to their own private affairs."318
<P>    a.  Documents Were Transferred to Williams & Connolly on July 27

<P>While recollections differ as to the exact sequence of events, it is certain that the personal files of President and Mrs. Clinton that had been in Vincent Foster's office were retrieved by the Clintons' personal lawyer on July 27, 1993.
<P>Robert Barnett, a member of the Williams & Connolly law firm, was serving as President and Mrs. Clinton's personal lawyer in July 1993.  He recalled that he went to the White House on July 27, 1993, having previously arranged with Margaret Williams to pick up personal documents of the Clintons.319  Williams took him to a room on the third floor of the White House residence, where they removed the box of documents from a closet.320  Barnett testified that he opened the box, reviewed the file labels, placed all the contents back in the box, and taped the box shut.321  He estimated this process took no more than 10 minutes.322  Barnett recalled that Williams arranged for an employee of Williams & Connolly to be cleared into the White House to pick up the box.323  While Barnett does not recall seeing or speaking with Mrs. Clinton that day, he testified he "cannot 2-1/2 years later rule out the possibility."324  He was certain that Mrs. Clinton was not present while he reviewed the contents of the box.325  
<P>Like Barnett, Williams recalled that Barnett assumed custody of the Clintons' personal files on July 27.  Her recollection differed from his regarding the sequence of events leading up to the transfer of documents that day.  While she recalled speaking with Barnett about transferring the Clintons' files to him at some point, she did not recall arranging with Barnett that he pick up the documents that day.326  She recalled encountering Barnett speaking with Mrs. Clinton on the second floor of the White House residence on July 27.327  Williams does not recall accompanying Barnett to the third floor of the White House residence; she recalled accompanying the Williams & Connolly employee to the third floor.328
<P>There is no evidence that any files were removed or tampered with before they were transferred to Williams & Connolly.  Barnett testified,
<P>. . . neither the President nor the First Lady nor Margaret Williams nor Susan Thomases nor Socks the cat instructed me to do anything improper with those documents, and if they had, they would have received a response from me that neither they nor I would have forgotten.329

<P>. . . on no occasion, no occasion, did Mrs. Clinton suggest, instruct or any other way indicate that anything improper should be done with the files or anything involving the matters that the files deal with.  And nothing was done.330

<P>On July 26, 1993, Susan Thomases called Mrs. Clinton's scheduler; she does not recall what she discussed with the scheduler.331  She does not recall having an appointment to see Mrs. Clinton on July 27.332  Thomases traveled to Washington, DC on July 27, 1993.  Although she does not remember it, White House records indicate she visited the residence that day.333  Thomases did not remember seeing Mrs. Clinton on July 27.334  Thomases testified that she did not know that a box of documents from Foster's office had been moved to the White House, and never saw the box.335  
<P>"I can . . . tell you that I had no knowledge that a box of documents from Vince Foster's office ever went to the White House residence.  I know no one even talked to me about it before it happened, and I certainly never saw or handled the box of documents."336

She does not remember discussing Foster's documents with Mrs. Clinton at that time:

<P>"I don't think that I ever discussed documents with Hillary Clinton in any time proximate to Vince Foster's death, and for at least more than a year after that."337

<H3>  B.  Introduction to Rose Law Firm Billing Records</H3>

<P>The Special Committee devoted substantial attention to the discovery in January 1996 of Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House.  The Committee attempted to ascertain who brought the records into the White House and who handled them once they were there.  Given the fallibility of individuals' recollections and the passage of time, it may not be possible to answer these questions fully.  Based on an incomplete record, the Majority suggests the possibility of two improper acts:  that the billing records may have been removed from Vincent Foster's office after his death, and that they were deliberately withheld from the Special Committee, the Independent Counsel, and the Federal agencies that were seeking them.  Such deductions are not supported by the record.  They also cannot obscure two salient points regarding the billing records: they were produced to the Committee, the Independent Counsel and others, and they do not contradict other statements by Mrs. Clinton and other partners of the Rose Law Firm regarding the representation of Madison Guaranty.
<P>1.  Billing Records Were Produced by the White House

<P>Carolyn Huber has served as Special Assistant to the President for Personal Correspondence since February 1, 1993.338  Huber opens and disburses all personal correspondence for President and Mrs. Clinton.  She also prepares the Clintons' personal bills, maintains their personal financial records, and attends to the Clintons' house guests at the White House.  Huber served as administrator of the Arkansas Governor's Mansion from 1979 to 1980 and as Administrator of the Rose Law Firm from 1981 to 1993.339
<P>In January 1996, Huber had some furniture removed from her White House East Wing office.  She used the occasion to review the contents of a box of photographs and other materials to be catalogued that had been under a table, and discovered the Rose Law Firm billing records:
<P>I had some new furniture built in my office.  I have some new built-ins.  And I had this big table in there.  When I got my new built-ins I didn't need a table anymore because I have shelves and I can put all my things up.  So I had called to have it moved that morning [January 4, 1996]. . . . So they took the table out.  So then I decided I'd start trying to put my things up on the shelves, and I picked up this billing memo and opened it, and I was surprised.340

<P>I had a large table, about a 6-foot table by 3 feet.  This table was beside my old desk over these records.  On Thursday morning [January 4, 1996], the movers came over, moved out the table and it just exposed all the stuff on the floor.  I thought I have to get this stuff up off the floor.  I needed to have some kind of organization in my office.  So, I went over to the box and picked up these records, opened it up.341

<P>Huber believed that these records had been requested by investigating authorities, and immediately called David Kendall, the personal attorney for President and Mrs. Clinton.342  When Kendall returned her call, she asked him to come to her office because she wanted to show him the documents she had found.343  Kendall came to Huber's office approximately one hour later, looked at the documents, and left them with Huber.344 
<P>Later that afternoon, Kendall returned to Huber's office, accompanied by Special Counsel to the President Jane Sherburne and Huber's personal attorney, Henry Schuelke.345  They proceeded to review the documents together.  Kendall testified,
<P>We decided that we had to review the documents more carefully so we moved to an office just down the hall, which was a little bit bigger than Huber's office.  Ms. Huber was able then to sit at a desk and review the documents with us page by page, as the three of us stood around her and could observe each page. . . . [They learned] that each of these pages did appear to in some way reflect law firm records of the billing for the Madison Guaranty representation in the 1985-86 period.  There was a little work in '87.  And the top document appeared to be a client billing and payment history which had a run date of February 12, 1992.346

<P>At the end of this review, the lawyers concluded that the billing records were called for by various requests for documents from government agencies.347  They decided to copy the documents, so that copies could be given to each of the entities that had requested it.  Because the documents contained some colored handwriting and Post-it notes, they decided to make color photocopies.  Kendall testified,
<P>. . . we had a discussion, both during the review and then after the review was completed, in which we had jointly decided that we needed to produce the documents as quickly as possible, we needed to keep a copy, and we should get this done as quickly as possible. ... And Ms. Huber and Ms. Sherburne set out at the end of our review process to try and locate, in the White House, a color photocopier.348

<P>A color copier was located in the New Executive Office Building, and between about 7:00 and about 10:00 we were able to make two copies.  It was a very slow, slow process.349

<P>Kendall recalled that when he first looked at the documents with Huber, "I told Ms. Huber that I thought we would immediately produce the documents."350  Indeed, the documents were copied on the night of January 4 and produced to the Independent Counsel, the Senate Special Committee, the House Banking Committee, and the FDIC the next day, January 5, 1996.351
<P>    a.  Billing Records Do Not Contradict Mrs. Clinton's Statements Regarding
<P><P>   Representation of Madison Guaranty

<P>The documents found by Huber are copies of Rose Law Firm billing records for the firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980's.  While these records provide more detail than was previously available, they do not contradict what Mrs. Clinton and Rose Law Firm lawyers have said about the representation of Madison Guaranty.  The Rose Law Firm was not Madison Guaranty's regular outside counsel, and handled only certain discrete assignments for the institution.  Within the firm, Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison Guaranty was limited in time and scope.  Work performed for Madison Guaranty comprised only a small fraction of the firm's total billings and of Mrs. Clinton's total billings.
 <P>The billing records reflect time billed by Rose Law Firm personnel to Madison Guaranty from April 1985 to March 1987.  The firm billed Madison Guaranty $19,344.75 for 205.95 hours of work by 15 Rose Law Firm attorneys and paralegals during that time.*   Rose Law Firm associate Rick Massey billed the most time, 80.5 hours.  Work performed was divided among six individual "matters."  These were General, Preferred Stock Offering, Limited Partnership, Bibler Golden, Industrial Development Corporation, and Babcock Loan.  The Limited Partnership matter was billed the greatest number of hours, 60.5; the Preferred Stock Offering was billed the next greatest number of hours, 55.1.
<P>The documents reflect that Hillary Rodham Clinton billed 59.8 hours to the representation of Madison Guaranty over a 15-month period, from April 1985 through July 1986.**  The largest portion of her time, 24.45 hours, was billed to the Industrial Development Corporation matter.  She also billed 13.6 hours to the Preferred Stock Offering matter, 10.4 hours to General, 8.8 hours to the Babcock Loan matter, and 5.8 hours to the Limited Partnership matter.  Her work on the Preferred Stock Offering occurred from April 1985 to December 1985; her work on the Industrial Development Corporation matter occurred from December 1985 to April 1986.  Ronald Clark, chief operating officer of the Rose Law Firm, verified for the Committee what is evident to even a casual observer: 60 hours of work over a 15-month period is not a significant amount of work for an attorney.352
<P>The billing records do not contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements regarding her representation of Madison Guaranty.  Mrs. Clinton was asked about the Preferred Stock Offering matter at a press conference on April 22, 1994.  In particular, she was asked about a letter she sent to Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett on behalf of Madison Guaranty.  Mrs. Clinton explained that Massey performed the legal work with respect to Madison Guaranty's application to issue preferred stock, and that she signed the letter in her capacity as billing partner on the matter:
<P>The young attorney, [Mr. Massey and] the young bank officer [Mr. Latham] did all the work, and the letter was sent.  But because I was what you call the billing attorney, in other words I had to send the bill to get the payment made, my name was put at the bottom of the letter.

Mrs. Clinton provided additional detail regarding the Preferred Stock Offering matter in response to interrogatories by the Resolution Trust Corporation.  She stated,
<P>In April 1985, the Rose Law Firm communicated with the Arkansas Securities Department with regard to a proposal by Madison Guaranty to issue preferred stock in order to raise capital and thereby increase its regulatory net worth.  As I understood it, the law firm had been retained by Madison Guaranty to accomplish two things: (1) to determine whether it was permissible under Arkansas law for a savings and loan association to issue preferred stock, and (2) if it was, to secure permission from the Securities Department to issue that stock through a wholly-owned brokerage firm.  While I was the billing partner on this matter, the great bulk of the work was done by Richard Massey, who was then an associate at Rose and whose specialty was securities law.  I was not involved in the day-to-day work on the project.  My knowledge of the events concerning this representation . . . is largely second-hand since my contemporaneous involvement in the representation was minimal and since Mr. Massey primarily handled the matter.353
<P>
She stated that Massey

<P>kept me generally advised of what he was doing and may have sent me drafts of the documents he was preparing.  I was not, however, an expert on securities law.  I believe that Massey consulted with members of the firm's securities department.354

<P>The billing records discovered by Huber do not contradict these statements.  They show that Massey billed 26 hours to the Madison Guaranty Preferred Stock Offering matter (13.3 hours in April, May, June and July, 1985 and another 12.7 hours in November and December, 1985).  Massey's time entries indicate he performed legal research regarding the proposed stock offering and drafted the offering materials. Mrs. Clinton billed roughly half as much time to this matter as Massey, namely 13.6 hours (7.1 hours in April, May and June, 1985 and 6.5 hours in November and December, 1985).  Her time entries indicate that she reviewed documents; they do not indicate that she drafted any documents.
<P>Responding to the RTC's interrogatories regarding this subject, Mrs. Clinton stated,
<P>I was not involved in any meetings with state regulators on these matters.  I may have made one telephone call to the Arkansas Securities Department to find out to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries regarding an S&L matter.  I do not remember to whom I spoke.355
<P>
The billing records indicate Mrs. Clinton had one telephone conversation, with Bassett on April 29, 1985.
<P>Similarly, the billing records do not contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements regarding her work on the Industrial Development Corporation matter.  The RTC by interrogatory asked Mrs. Clinton about her knowledge of a real estate project known as Castle Grande; Mrs. Clinton replied she did not believe she knew about this project prior to 1992.356  Confusion arose because the RTC used the term "Castle Grande" to refer to an entire 1,050 acre tract of property that IDC sold to Madison Financial and Seth Ward in 1985.  In response to further interrogatories from the RTC, Mrs. Clinton explained that she understood Castle Grande to refer to just a portion of the property, a residential development that she was not aware of at that time:
<P>. . . `IDC' was the billing name for work involving that property at the Rose Law Firm.  My knowledge about the IDC PROPERTY was limited, and I can recall knowing nothing about the Castle Grande Estates portion of it. . . . I believe that my work on the IDC matter was confined to discrete legal questions which arose after the acquisition of the IDC PROPERTY.357

Consistent with Mrs. Clinton's statement, the Rose Law Firm billing records refer to this matter strictly as "Industrial Development Corporation," and never as "Castle Grande."  Rose Law Firm attorneys Massey, Clark, Fitzhugh, Thrash, Donovan and Dover also all testified that the firm's work was referred to as "IDC," not "Castle Grande."
<P>The billing records indicate Mrs. Clinton billed 24.45 hours to the Industrial Development Corporation matter from December 1985 to April 1986.  This time included telephone conversations with Seth Ward and review of a memorandum prepared by Rose Law Firm attorney Rick Donovan.  Mrs. Clinton stated to the RTC,
<P>I remember almost nothing about this work, but after reviewing certain memoranda prepared by Rose Law Firm lawyer Rick Donovan and copies of the Rose Law Firm billing records . . . I believe that the work I did on this matter consisted primarily of supervising research concerning legal issues, such as whether it would be legal to open a tasting room for a proposed brewery, in light of the fact that the land was, arguably, located in what had once been a `dry' township, and other questions relating to the provision of water and sewer service by a utility which was located within the IDC PROPERTY.  I believe that, based upon my time records, I conferred with Seth Ward on several occasions, and I believe that I would have discussed the legal research the firm was conducting, but I have no recollection of the content of these conversations.  Also . . . I believe that I had some limited involvement with an option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial (which appears to have been billed as a `General' rather than an `IDC' matter), although I have no recollection of that project.358 
<P>
Mrs. Clinton billed 10.4 hours to the Madison Guaranty "General" matter over the period September 1985 to March 1987; 2.4 hours of that time billed in May and June 1986 includes time preparing the option agreement and a telephone conversation with Seth Ward regarding the option.
<P>    b.  Chain of Custody of Billing Records Before Discovery in January 1996

<P>The Special Committee sought to establish the chain of custody of the Rose Law Firm billing records prior to their discovery by Huber in January 1996.  The Client Billing & Payment History bears a run date of February 12, 1992, suggesting that the document was generated during the 1992 Presidential campaign to collect available billing information then available; this suggestion is supported by testimony of Webster Hubbell and others.  Huber testified that she first encountered the documents in the White House Residence in the summer of 1995.  It is not possible on the existing record to ascertain when and by what means the billing records were brought into the White House, and in whose custody they remained once they were there.  While the records seem to have been in Vincent Foster's possession during the 1992 campaign, it is not clear whether he brought them to the White House, or whether he provided them to someone else before his death.  Through her attorney, Mrs. Clinton has stated that she was unaware that the billing records were in the White House.  She stated publicly on January 26, 1996, "I do not know how the billing records came to be found where they were found, but I am pleased that they were found, because they confirm what I have been saying."
<P>Huber testified before the Committee that she first encountered the billing records during the first or second week of August 1995.359  She first saw them in the "Book Room," a room on the third floor of the White House residence used at that time to store gifts, photographs, newspaper and magazine articles, and other items to be catalogued.360
<P>I go up into that room periodically to pick up . . . the knickknacks to take down to my office, and that day I went up to get a bunch of magazines and newspaper clippings that we have kept over the years to take them over to my office in the East Wing so that I could get them catalogued. . . . And I had several boxes, and there was a particular box on top of the table that I had -- had some of the knickknacks in, and over on the edge of the corner was these documents.  And I saw them.  I just -- they were folded.  I didn't open them.  I just picked them up and plunked them down into the box.  And I called the usher's office, if they could come help me tote all these boxes back to my office.  So they came up with their little dollies.  We carried them to my office.  I put them on the floor and left them there.361

<P>I thought it had been left there for me to take down and file it in the filing that I do.362

Huber testified that the documents were not on the table in the Book Room when she last had occasion to be in that room, a week or two before.363 
<P>Huber retrieved four or five boxes of materials to be catalogued from the Book Room that day.364  She testified that the documents remained undisturbed in a box on the floor of her office from August 1995 to January 4, 1996, when the table was removed from the office and Huber examined the contents of the box.365
<P>Jane Sherburne testified that on January 4, 1996, Huber was unclear as to when she had first encountered the billing records and whether she had recognized them:
<P>I recall Ms. Huber as being -- she said a number of different things that were inconsistent.  She was flustered, she was upset, her hands were shaking.  She said that she had brought the documents over from the residence at some earlier point.  She said she thought it was maybe three months ago.  A little while later in the conversation, she referred to bringing them over 10 months ago.  She was very confused about the timing.  She also said that -- we asked her where she had found the records in the White House.  She said they were in the third floor, and she identified the book room.366

<P>The chronology was that at some earlier point, what appeared to be in her mind somewhere between three and 10 months prior to January 4, she had been in the book room in the residence, which is on the third floor, and that she had identified these documents when she was putting a box together or a couple of boxes together of material that she was going to move to her East Wing office, and sort out later and decide what to do with.367

<P>. . . At one point I recall her indicating that when she had first seen the records, they appeared to her to be Rose Law Firm billing records.  But then again at another point, I understood her to say she had first seen these documents and just considered them to be a sheaf of documents.368

<P>. . . I certainly thought she was confused that night.  I heard her testimony as well when she testified before this Committee and recognized that her description of the events had become much more precise.  That doesn't change the fact that on the night of the 4th of January when she was describing this, that she was very confused and that her recollections were very imprecise.369

<P>Whether or not the billing records were in the Book Room in August 1995, it appears that the billing records were in the possession of Vincent Foster in February 1992.  Webster Hubbell testified that during the Presidential campaign early in 1992, an issue arose regarding contacts Mrs. Clinton may have had with the Arkansas Securities Department on behalf of Madison Guaranty.370  Either Hubbell or Foster requested that the billing records be printed by the Rose Law Firm accounting department.371  
<P>I recall in 1992 that the issue regarding our representation of Madison and specifically our work before the Arkansas Securities Department was of interest to Mr. Gerth of The New York Times, and that our firm was being questioned by people within the campaign about her work in that regard.  We did some work in trying to organize and pull up the files.  And in connection with that, bills were pulled and reviewed by myself and Mr. Foster and Mr. Massey, I believe.372

<P>Hubbell reviewed the billing records at the Rose Law Firm.373  Hubbell believes he gave the records to Foster after reviewing them.374  He identified Foster's handwriting on the records; he does not recall having seen Foster's handwriting on the records in 1992.*375  Hubbell believes Foster wrote on the documents at the time he reviewed them in 1992.376  He does not recall seeing the records again after reviewing them in February 1992, did not remove them from the law firm, and does not know if Foster removed them.377  The billing records were not provided to Hubbell when he was assembling various files from the Rose Law Firm and the campaign regarding Madison Guaranty.378  Hubbell did not know if the billing records were in Foster's office at the time of his death; Foster never discussed them.379
<P>For a few weeks in 1992, Thomases helped the Clinton campaign prepare answers to press inquiries regarding Whitewater.380  A reporter asked Thomases about legal work Mrs. Clinton had done for Madison Guaranty.381  Thomases called Hubbell to ask him about the records of Mrs. Clinton's work at the Rose Law Firm.382  Her notes of her telephone conversation with Hubbell indicate that he provided her information based on Mrs. Clinton's time records.383  Thomases never saw the billing records prior to their discovery in January 1996.384  Hubbell recalled discussing the billing records with Loretta Lynch, but did not recall discussing them with Thomases.385
<P>Hubbell's and Thomases's testimony regarding the billing records are supported by Loretta Lynch, a Clinton campaign worker.  Along with Hubbell and Thomases, Lynch became involved in February 1992 in responding to press inquiries regarding Whitewater.386  She recalled that, in the course of that assignment, Hubbell indicated to her that he had reviewed the Rose Law Firm's billing records for Madison Guaranty.387  He also told her that he had discussed the existence of such billing records with Vincent Foster.388  Lynch also discussed this matter with Thomases at that time; Thomases did not indicate that she had reviewed the billing records.389
<P>The fingerprint analysis of the documents performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the Independent Counsel also supports Hubbell's and Thomases's testimony.390  The FBI found fingerprints of Foster and Mrs. Clinton; these prints could have been made when the records were reviewed during the campaign, in February 1992, in keeping with Hubbell's testimony.  The FBI also found fingerprints of three individuals who were employees of the Rose Law Firm in February 1992: Carolyn Huber, Mildred Alston and Sandra Hatch.*  The FBI found no fingerprints of Susan Thomases; this supports her testimony that she never saw the documents.  The FBI also found no fingerprints of Margaret Williams; this supports her testimony that she did not remove any documents from Vincent Foster's office the night of his death.
<P>The testimony and the fingerprint analysis leave open the possibility that Foster brought the billing records to the White House.  If so, they may have passed out of his possession before his death.  Linda Tripp, a secretary in the White House Counsel's office testified that Huber brought files into and out of Foster's office "fairly often."391  It is possible that the billing records were moved into or within the Book Room inadvertently.  There was construction in and around the Book Room in the summer of 1995, in connection with repairs to the White House heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.392  Although the construction workers were instructed not to move anything without permission, items were moved in order to expedite the construction.393
<P>Other suppositions are no doubt possible as well, given the incomplete state of the record.  There is no evidence in the record at all, however, of any concerted effort to suppress the billing records.  Given that the billing records do not contradict other statements regarding the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty, a motivation to suppress the records is not readily apparent.  The record is clear that Mrs. Clinton was not part of the chain of custody of these documents: on January 5, 1996, Kendall issued a statement saying, "the First Lady was not aware until today that these records were located in the White House."  On January 26, 1996, Mrs. Clinton herself told the press, "I do not know how the billing records came to be found where they were found, but I am pleased that they were found, because they confirm what I have been saying."

<H3>ENDNOTES FOR PART II. WASHINGTON PHASE</H3>



     *  The Committee's record indicates that in the fall of 1992 a female employee in the RTC's Kansas City field office -- the office to which Lewis was assigned at the time -- did improperly disclose to a person outside the RTC the fact that the RTC had submitted a criminal referral in a case that "might touch on the Clintons" (Wright, 4/25/96 Hrg. p.117).  Betsey Wright, the Deputy Chairperson of the 1992 Clinton Campaign, testified that in September or October 1992 she received a call from a Clinton supporter in California.  This person, whose name Wright could not recall at the time of her testimony before the Committee, told Wright that he had just returned from a business trip to Kansas City.  He informed Wright that he had gone to a cocktail party in Kansas City and that a female RTC official told him at the party that the RTC had "just sent a criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock" (Wright, 4/25/96 Hrg. pp.117-121; Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. pp.157-158).  The criminal referral, according to the female RTC official, was "about an S&L officer which would implicate the Clintons in Arkansas" (Wright, 4/25/96 Hrg. pp.117-118).<BR>
     *  The General Accounting Office reached a harsher conclusion in its 1994 report on CMS:<BR>
<P>
          Mr. Hale operated Capital Management in an improper manner by entering into prohibited transactions.  Such prohibited transactions included loans to business associates and loans for real estate purchases, both of which violated SBA regulations.  He also took advantage of the opening provided by the flexibility in SBA guidelines -- for determining socially or economically disadvantaged individuals -- to provide loans to individuals with questionable claims to program eligibility.<BR>
<P>
U.S. General Accounting Office, "Small Business Administration: Inadequate Oversight of Capital Management Services, Inc. - an SSBIC," GAO/OSI-94-23, p. 3 (March 21, 1994) (citations omitted).<BR>
     *  While the Majority's report gives Lewis credit for identifying suspected criminal activities that formed the basis of the indictment against Tucker and the McDougals, the facts are as follows.  James McDougal's criminal activities were "old news" by the time Lewis drafted the 1992 referrals.  The government had already prosecuted McDougal just a few years earlier.  McDougal had been stricken by serious physical and mental illnesses.  He was also destitute and living in a borrowed trailer; clearly there was no prospect of McDougal being held financially accountable for losses suffered by the RTC.<BR>

     Two of Lewis' 1993 referrals became the basis of charges against Tucker.  The facts contained in RTC Criminal Referral No. 730CR0190, which accused Tucker of diverting approximately $135,000 in proceeds from a Madison Guaranty loan, were described as overt acts in Count I of the indictment.  A jury convicted Tucker on this count.  The facts contained in RTC Criminal Referral No. 730CR0198, which accused Tucker of participating in fraudulent land transactions regarding a Main Street property in Little Rock, were contained in Count 20 of the indictment.  A jury acquitted Tucker of this charge.<BR>
<P>
     As previously discussed, however, Lewis's contribution to the 1992 referral was substantially marred.  The document was poorly drafted and improperly designated the Clintons as "witnesses" to alleged criminal offenses.  <BR>
     *  According to Lewis, even Congressman Jim Leach described Lewis's taping of this conversation without Breslaw's consent as "inappropriate. (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p.238).<BR>
     *  When the Justice Department assumed control of the investigation stemming from the nine referrals, the deputy chief of the Fraud Section, Allen Carver, recognized that FBI agents in Little Rock had "wanted to get speedier action on getting documents that they were trying to get from the RTC."  To ease tensions between the FBI and the RTC in Kansas City, Carver sent Mackay to Kansas City in early November 1993 "to try to work with the Kansas City RTC and to develop a relationship with them . . . ."  Carver, 10/17/95 Dep. pp.120-122.<BR>
     *  The implication has been raised that Lindsey knew Archie Schaffer would attend the basketball game and contrived to speak with him.  There is no evidence to support this allegation.  On the contrary, Lindsey testified that attending the basketball game was not a disguise for meeting with either Mr. Schaffer or Ms. Schaffer (Lindsey, 01/16/96 Hrg. pp.229-230.)<BR>
     *  The Committee did not seek testimony from Tisdale. <BR>
     *  One non-White House deposition was conducted after July 23; Comptroller of the Currency Gene Ludwig was deposed on July 27.  However, there is no evidence that Ludwig's testimony was influenced by the release of the transcripts to the White House.<BR>
     *  Along with Assistant General Counsel Robert McNamara, Schmalzbach and McHale played a similar role in connection with all five investigations into the White House/Treasury contacts.  <BR>

<H3> ENDNOTES FOR III.  THE ARKANSAS PHASE </H3>



<P>     *  Patterson was the president of Citizens Bank from 1972-1979.  Burge was a senior vice president and later president of the bank from 1978-1979.  Ritter was the president, chief executive officer and director of the bank from 1979-1983.<BR>
     **     Patterson testified that "if you-all go back and check everything that I and the bank had done, you'll probably find loans we lent 120 percent on, and you will probably find loans we didn't lend 50 percent on.  And that's just community country banking." (Patterson, 2/22/96 Dep. p.39.)  Patterson also testified that "I feel real sure that realtors like Wade and lots of other biggies in that region could not only get 100 percent financing, but they would get as much financing as was required to put water, streets or whatever was involved in it."  (Patterson, 2/22/96 Dep. p.43.)<BR></P>


<P>     *  Whitewater Development "dispersed $21,346.29 to Union Bank in repayment of the $20,000 earnest money loan taken out by Jim McDougal and Attorney General Clinton on June 19, 1978.  Jim McDougal personally borrowed $20,000 on June 19, 1980 from the Bank of Cherry Valley and deposited these funds into a Whitewater account on June 20, 1980."  (A Preliminary Report on Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Whitewater Development Company, Inc., Prepared for the Resolution Trust Corporation by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, April 24, 1995, p.30 (citations omitted).)<BR>
     *  Blood Sport, by James Stewart, erroneously states that Proctor had turned over "much of the Whitewater [loan] file" to Vernon Dewey by 1986.  Blood Sport, p.149.  Actually, Proctor retained complete responsibility for the loan file until the loan was retired in May 1992.  (Proctor, 5/2/96 Dep. pp.13-14; Strange, 5/2/96 Dep. pp.32, 107.) In his deposition, Dewey conceded that he never had responsibility for the Whitewater file.  (Dewey, 5/3/96 Dep. p.55.)<BR>
     *  Although Proctor could not recall when this discussion occurred, the records show that Wade purchased the remaining Whitewater lots in May 1985.<BR>
     *  The Clintons did not become involved in loan renewals until at least 1988.  Proctor did not communicate with Mrs. Clinton regarding the loan until 1990.  "She wasn't really involved in the loan" until approximately 1990.  (Proctor, 5/2/96 Dep. p.40.)  Even then, Proctor never spoke with Governor Clinton about the loan.  (Proctor, 5/8/96 Hrg. pp.94-95.)<BR>
     **  Also, many of the most valuable lots already had been sold, which naturally reduced the average value of the remaining lots.<BR>
     ***  Proctor never conveyed his opinion regarding the value of the property to the Clintons or the McDougals.  He did not believe that the Clintons or McDougals were aware of his analysis. Proctor, 5/2/96 Dep. pp.88-89.<BR>
     *  Although Dewey voted to approve the loan, he testified that he actually believed it should be declined.  Dewey stated:  "I thought it should be renewed because it was the Governor of the State of Arkansas, not that it was a good loan."  However, Dewey conceded that no one pressured him to approve the loan; his vote reflected his own judgment.<BR>
     *  It was not significant that the loan was approved on January 8, 1987, pending receipt of the Clintons' financial statement.  Proctor testified that the financial statement was helpful, but that even without the financial statement, the loan was justified because it was collateralized and the bank was being paid from an escrow fund.  (Proctor, 5/2/96 Dep. pp.82-83.)  In any event, the loan was not actually renewed until the financial statement was provided to the bank.<BR>
     *  Penick did not recall offering to ask Davenport to speak with Mrs. Clinton.  (Penick, 5/9/96 Hrg. pp.147-148.)  Strange also did not recall the conversation.  (Strange, 5/9/96 Hrg. p.148.)<BR>
     *  According to Blood Sport, Whitewater was the only "investment or holding" listed on Governor Clinton's state financial disclosure form.<BR>
     **  Blood Sport never mentions the second page of the financial statement.  Moreover, the financial statement is reproduced in an appendix to the book as a one page document.  Taken together, these facts strongly suggest that a mistake was made in treating the financial statement as a one page document.<BR>
     *  The Clintons' apparent confusion regarding the status of the property and the balance on the loan tends to confirm that the Clintons were passive investors in Whitewater and that the McDougals managed the investment.<BR>
     **  Nevertheless, on December 12, 1987, the loan committee approved Proctor's request to waive the McDougal's financial statement requirement.  (Doc. No. CBF0403, December 12, 1987 Minutes of First Ozark Officers Loan Committee Meeting.)<BR>
     *  The waiver occurred on the same day that Governor Clinton signed the 1988 Omnibus Banking Bill.  However, there is no evidence that would connect these two events.<BR>
     *  In Blood Sport, Dewey is quoted as connecting the legislation to "a few calls" made by TCB officials, but in his deposition, he testified at his deposition that he had no reason to believe that there was any connection between the Whitewater loan and branch banking legislation. (Dewey, 5/3/96, Dep. pp.71-72.)<BR>
     *  On April 27, 1983, MBT consented to the FDIC's entry of an order that required the bank to cease and desist from, among other things, extending credit outside Madison County or the western half of Newton County, Arkansas unless the loan was approved by the bank's board of directors.  (Doc. No. DKSN 001157, In the Matter of Madison Bank and Trust, Order to Cease and Desist, April 27, 1983.)  Mrs. Clinton took out her loan on December 16, 1980 -- over two years before the Cease and Desist Order was in effect.  The loan was repaid in October 1993.  The record is silent as to whether MBT's board of directors ever discussed Mrs. Clinton's loan.  (Bunch, 5/2/96 Dep. p.92; Pockrus, 4/26/96 Dep. p.33.)<BR>
     *  On May 4, 1985, WWDC sold the remaining 24 Whitewater Estates lots to Ozark Air in exchange for an airplane and Ozark Air's assumption of $35,000 of the balance on the McDougals' and the Clintons' original Citizens Bank loan.  According to the Pillsbury Report, "May 1985 . . . marked the end of Whitewater as a project.  By the end of May, the land was gone; all that remained behind was debt and notes receivable that did not generate enough cash to service the debt.  The Company would continue to exist but there was never again any prospect that it might turn a profit." (PM&S Report on Madison Guaranty, 4/24/95, p.123).<BR>
     *  Until 1987 the tax laws permitted taxpayers to deduct the full amount of interest paid on personal loans. (Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-514, 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News) After 1986 the deductibility of interest on personal loans (other than home mortgage loans meeting certain requirements) was gradually "phased out" through 1991.<BR>
     *  According to a May 1996 review of Whitewater tax issues conducted by three tax experts for the Clintons' personal attorney, David Kendall (hereinafter "the May 1996 Review"), $1,000 of the $10,131 deduction in 1978 was for interest on a Union National Bank loan and the remaining $9,131 was for interest on the Citizens Bank loan.<BR>
     **  The Clintons' 1979 tax return was the subject of an Internal Revenue Service audit. (Doc. No. DKSN 000977 and Norton Hrg. p.38)   No adjustments were required as a result of that audit (Doc. Nos DKSN 000980-000981), and the tax return included the $11,753 deduction for Whitewater interest listed here (Doc. Nos DKRT 800007-800021).<BR>
     ***  Unbeknownst to the Clintons, some of these deductions were also claimed by WWDC.  The Clintons corrected these inadvertent errors in 1993 and 1996, as discussed below.<BR>
     *  At the outset of the investment, the Clintons' tax preparer at the time, Gaines Norton, advised James McDougal that even if Whitewater was formed as a "Subchapter S" corporation (in which losses and gains are passed directly to the shareholders without taxation at the corporate level), such expenses likely could not be deducted on the individuals' personal returns.  Norton recalls that McDougal disputed this point, and Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Norton not to pursue the matter further because Mr. McDougal was in charge of the investment.  (Norton Hrg. pp.6-9; Norton Dep. pp.108-112)  In any event, WWDC never filed its tax return as a Subchapter S corporation and, consistent with Norton's view, the Clintons never claimed deductions for WWDC losses on their personal tax returns.<BR>
     *  In fact, the tax treatment of the Whitewater investment may have been unduly conservative.  The May 1996 Review concluded, inter alia, that:  "With better tax advice, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton and the McDougals could legitimately have structured their Whitewater investment to fully utilize corporate losses, with substantially greater federal income tax benefits than they took or received."  (May 1996 Review, p.4)<BR>
     **  Consistent with the testimony provided to the Special Committee, the May 1996 Review states that "the Whitewater investment does not appear to have been structured as a device to save federal income taxes."  (May 1996 Review, p.4)<BR>
     ***  The Majority raises questions about possible unreported income from the Clintons January 1977 purchase of 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor Inc., another real estate development managed by James McDougal.  The limited evidence available with respect to this almost twenty-year-old transaction is not adequate to establish that any income beyond what the Clintons reported on their tax returns was in fact received.  The available evidence does not demonstrate any improprieties, and the Majority's accusation, based on partial information and a series of unsupported assumptions, is inappropriate and irresponsible.<BR>
     *  Every study of Whitewater has reached this conclusion, including the "Lyons Report" prepared during the 1992 presidential campaign (Doc. Nos. JML 077-JML 083, March 23, 1992; see also Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. p.203) and the Pillsbury Madison & Sutro 1994-96 investigation (Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Whitewater Development Company, Inc., A Preliminary Report to the Resolution Trust Corporation, Prepared by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, April 24, 1995 (hereinafter "PM&S Preliminary Report"); Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Whitewater Development Company, Inc., A Supplemental Report to the Resolution Trust Corporation, Prepared by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, December 13, 1995, (hereinafter "PM&S, Supplemental Report")).  Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro stated that personal tax issues were not within the scope its inquiry, however. (PM&S Preliminary Report, 4/24/95, p.28 n.122.)  Blood Sport, the book on Whitewater written by James Stewart, also portrays the McDougals as the sole managers of the investment until 1986.  (See Part One of Blood Sport.)<BR>
     **  In 1987, after the McDougals left Arkansas and stopped attending to the affairs of Whitewater, Mrs. Clinton attempted to obtain information about the investment.  She contacted James to obtain corporate records (James, 5/5/96 Dep. pp.42-45; Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 50-51), and she asked Yoly Redden, who was then the Clintons' personal tax preparer, to review the records and try to determine how much money the Clintons had put into Whitewater and what the financial condition of the enterprise was at that time (Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp.50-51).  The testimony of Redden and James confirms that the Clintons were never well-informed about Whitewater.<BR>
     *  The May 24, 1996 letter to Chairman James A. Leach of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services from David A. Kendall, the Clintons' personal attorney, transmitting the May 1996 Review states that the tax deficiencies alleged in the House report "are overwhelmingly erroneous or unsupported," and that "certain minor errors" had been corrected.  That letter also points out that the Clintons had "made no adjustment for Whitewater-related tax benefits they could have but did not take." (May 24, 1996 letter from D. Kendall to Hon. J. Leach)<BR>
     *  This letter shows that the Clintons relied upon the McDougals for information about Whitewater.  It also shows that the McDougals did not provide the Clintons with important information about Whitewater.  The previous month the McDougals had purchased a large property south of Little Rock from International Paper Co. in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation, without the knowledge of the Clintons.  When they purchased the property the McDougals represented to International Paper that they were the sole owners of WWDC.  (PM&S Preliminary Report on Whitewater Development, 4/24/95, pp.116-122; PM&S Report on Whitewater Development, 12/13/95, pp.62-64.)  The Clintons have stated that they were unaware of the International Paper transaction.  (Interrogatory Responses of Hillary Rodham Clinton, May 24, 1995, answer to Interrogatory No. 24(c), at 59-60; Interrogatory Responses of William Jefferson Clinton, May 24, 1995, answer to Interrogatory No. 24, at 46-47.) <BR>
     *  Technical accounting questions, such as whether these payments should have been accounted for as additional contributions of capital to WWDC by the McDougals or loans to the corporation by the McDougals, need not be resolved here.  The important point is that whatever the correct accounting treatment of these payments, they did not result in any taxable income to the Clintons.<BR>
     **  The Clintons did recognize a small gain of $3,313 on the Lot 13 transaction, but that gain is not relevant to this issue.<BR>
     *  This amount represents the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro finding that the Clintons invested $42,191 in Whitewater, adjusted for a $1,673 correction described on page 13 of the May 1996 Review. (See PM&S Preliminary Report, 4/24/95, p.130.)<BR>
     **  This difficulty was considered by Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, consulting with James Lyons and Yoly Redden, in 1993.  (Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. pp.108-109; Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 128-133, 236-238)  Foster's handwritten notes relating to this issue were produced to the Special Committee by the White House.  The notes include an entry referring to the Clintons' tax basis in Whitewater as a "can of worms" that should not be opened. (Doc. Nos. DKSN 000517-DKSN 000519, Handwritten notes of Vincent Foster.)  This reference has been mischaracterized in the press and during the Special Committee's hearings.  First, the term "can of worms" in the notes does not refer to the Whitewater investment generally, as has been stated in newspaper articles and elsewhere:  "In the note, Mr. Foster describes the Clintons' role in the Arkansas Whitewater Development Corp. as a "can of worms you shouldn't open." ("Foster's Death Center of Probe; Whitewater Review Starting in Senate", The Washington Times, July 18, 1995; see also statement of Special Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, press conference of Jan. 18, 1996).  Instead, the reference is to the technical issue of the documentation required to establish the Clintons' tax basis.  (Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp.237-238.)  In addition, Redden testified that it was she who told Foster that the basis issue was a can of worms that should not be opened, contrary to the newspaper articles and statements that have attributed that statement to Foster. <BR>
     *  Madison Bank & Trust should not be confused with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.  They were two different financial institutions that James McDougal controlled and operated at different times.  The potential for confusion stems from the fact that in each instance McDougal changed the name of the institution to "Madison" after he acquired control.  While the "Madison" in Madison Bank & Trust may have been selected because the bank was located in Madison County, Arkansas, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan (formerly Woodruff County Savings and Loan Association) was not in Madison County -- it was in a different part of the state altogether.  The use of a profile of President James Madison on Madison Guaranty's stationary suggests that McDougal may have selected the name of the bank because he admired President Madison.  Madison Bank employee Gary Bunch confirmed that point when he testified before the Special Committee (Bunch, 5/16/96 Hrg. p.42.) <BR>
     *  Although AHDA's rejection of the Brookwood space is documented in a letter dated March 5, 1984, the actual rejection likely occurred earlier.  The letter seems to reference an earlier agreement with SBS to reject the Brookwood space.<BR>
     **  It is unclear how this meeting came about.  Mallard has no specific recollection; he speculated that McDougal might have been in the building and Herr brought her to his office.  (Mallard, 2/14/96 Dep. pp.21-22.)  Herr recalled that McDougal was in Mallard's office and he called her in.  (Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. p.16.)  In any event, Mallard testified that it was common for building owners to visit him to pitch their buildings.  (Mallard, 2/14/96 Dep. p.74.)<BR>
     *  Epes testified that he did not sign the letter.  He speculated that it must have been authored by Deputy Director Anderson, and sent over his signature.  Epes did not take issue with the contents of the letter.<BR>
     *  Mallard could not identify the AHDA Board members.  However, he was certain that Governor Clinton, Betsey Wright and Sam Bratton did not attend.<BR>
     *  As noted previously, Epes lived near the Madison Guaranty Building and did not share his staff's safety concerns.  (Epes, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp.64, 68; Epes, 2/5/96, Dep. pp.172-173, 180.)<BR>
     *  As promised in the lease, Madison initially employed a security guard to address AHDA's security concerns.  Over time, Madison apparently halted this arrangement, perhaps because the security concerns raised by AHDA proved unfounded.  However, there is no dispute that Madison complied initially.<BR>
     *  Cox is deceased.<BR>
     *  Although Epes did not share the concern of his staff, he "didn't want [his] staff members to think that I didn't care about their concerns."  (Epes, 2/5/96 Dep. p.173.)<BR>
     *  (Hays, 2/23/96 Dep. p.106.)  Apparently Hays was correct.  Years later, in approximately July 1995, Hopkins told Hays that he was "just posturing" and "blowing smoke" during their April 1987 conversation.  (Hays, 2/23/96 Dep. pp.127-28.)<BR>
     *  Hopkins did not recall the conversation with Hays, and could not explain Miller's phone notes and memorandum.  (Hopkins, 2/14/96 Dep. pp.86-87.)<BR>
     *  No charges have been brought against Peacock by the Independent Counsel in connection with the contributions.  Nor has Peacock been granted immunity.  (Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp.157-58.)<BR>
     *  Ward owned part of the IDC property.  However, it is unclear whether Ward was acting as a principal, a real estate agent, or both when he showed Lyon the property.<BR>
     *  Singleton was appointed by Republican Governor Frank White.<BR>
     *  Lyon hoped to sell sandwiches and beer on the premises of his brewery.<BR>
     **  McDougal did not even consider purchasing the IDC property until the summer of 1985, well after the tasting room regulation was promulgated.  (Ward, 2/12/96 Dep. pp.6,10.)<BR>
     *  There have been allegations that Randolph's reference to $33,000 during a conversation with Nancy Hernreich was an allusion to the 1985 fundraiser James McDougal hosted for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty's main office -- which raised roughly $32,000.  Randolph's intent in making the statement was not clear to Hernreich and Bratton.  In her memorandum to Governor Clinton, Hernreich noted Randolph's reference to the money and then declared, "This was pretty cryptic."  (Doc. No. DKSN 018008, April 14, 1987 memorandum from Nancy Hernreich to Governor Clinton.)  Clinton's only substantive response to Hernreich's memorandum was to "see if Sam [Bratton] will call him."  (Doc. No. DKSN 018008.)  Bratton, who was not present during the conversation between Randolph and Hernreich, had "no idea what Mr. Randolph was trying to communicate" with his comment.  (Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. p.17).  Bratton did not discuss the matter with Governor Clinton.  (Bratton, 1/5/95 Dep. pp.51-52.)  Whatever Randolph may have meant, there is no evidence that campaign contributions in April 1985 had any influence on the legislation enacted in June 1987.<BR>
     *  In 1985, Strock noted that small utilities in the state were having some difficulty raising money to finance "health and safety related improvements."  He proposed several methods for addressing the problem, including a partial deregulation of small utilities.  In a January 17, 1985 memorandum, Strock proposed addressing regulatory difficulties faced by "small water companies" by eliminating the Commission's jurisdiction over them.  "This," he wrote, "would leave them unregulated, at least for rate purposes, but would allow the company to increase rates whenever it needed money.  The Department of Health would continue to have jurisdiction over the health and safety aspects of the company."<BR>
     *  Tucker and Randolph had formed CSW in December 1985 for the purpose of buying the sewer and water system at Castle Grande from Madison Financial for $1.2 million.  The purchase was financed by a $1,050,000 non-recourse loan from Madison Guaranty and a $150,000 loan from David Hale's Capital Management Services.  After the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ousted Jim McDougal from Madison Guaranty in July 1986, Madison Guaranty's board of directors questioned Tucker about his dealings with McDougal.  Tucker claimed that he and McDougal had an oral agreement in connection with the acquisition of the sewer and water system whereby McDougal promised Tucker 110 utility hookups annually at $500 per hookup.  When the Madison Guaranty board told Tucker it would not honor this agreement, Tucker hired Robert Shults and threatened to rescind the original purchase of the utility system unless Madison Guaranty agreed to renegotiate its loan to CSW.<BR>
     *  Dobbins testified that the temporary permits were obtained by Madison Financial on behalf of the purchasers of Maple Creek lots.  (Dobbins, 12/4/95 Dep. pp. 28,32).  Dobbins suspected that the buyers often did not see the permits, which contained stipulations indicating that the soil was marginal and that septic systems might not function properly.  (Dobbins, 12/4/95 Dep. pp. 28-30,32).  Dobbins believed that if the buyers had seen the temporary permits they might not have purchased the property, but under Arkansas law the Health Department had no authority to require that the buyers be provided the permits in advance of sale. (Dobbins, 12/4/95 Dep. pp. 33-34).  As discussed below, Dobbins was the primary target of McDougal's charges of unfair treatment by the Health Department when McDougal met with Governor Clinton and senior Health Department officials in March 1986.<BR>
     *  While an in-depth review of the regulatory actions of the Health Department and the complaints voiced by McDougal was beyond the scope of the Committee's investigation, it does appear that the Health Department sought to work with McDougal and that McDougal may not have fulfilled all of his undertakings in the two written agreements he entered into with the Health Department.  The Committee did not examine, however, whether McDougal's complaints against Dobbins had merit.  The focus of the Special Committee's inquiry was the role of the governor's office in the matter, not the underlying dispute between McDougal and the Health Department.<BR>
     *  The memorandum states that McDougal "needs to see you [Governor Clinton] before Tues. to get you to sign some personal business papers," and the notes on the memorandum show that a meeting was scheduled for Saturday, January 18.  (Doc. No. DKSN 013266, January 14, 1986 memorandum for Nancy Hernreich to Governor Clinton).  It appears that McDougal used that meeting as an opportunity to complain to Governor Clinton about the Health Department and provide a copy of his January 17 memorandum, which is discussed below.  <BR>
     *  Butler remembers that Governor Clinton called him and said there was a problem with a constituent, that the Health Department was "possibly messing over him [the constituent]," and asked Butler if he would be willing to meet with McDougal. (Butler, 12/5/95 Dep. pp.15-16).  Butler told Governor Clinton he would be glad to meet.  Clinton then told Butler that "the reason I think some of your staff is messing with this development is because this gentleman has been a supporter of mine since I ran for Congress and he has never asked me for anything." (Butler, 12/5/95 Dep. pp.15-16).<BR>
     *  When Butler was asked if any decision was made about Dobbins in the private conversation with Governor Clinton, Butler testified:  "No, Dobbins's name never came up with me and the Governor ever."  (Butler, 12/5/95  Dep. pp.24-25).<BR>
     *  A March 5, 1986 memorandum from Choate to Governor Clinton reports that Butler had met with the sanitarians and reassigned them.  The memorandum also reports that Butler instructed the sanitarians not to talk about McDougal's subdivisions "because they don't want to give credence to any of McDougal's allegations."  The memorandum goes on to describe the frustration of Butler, Hill and Saltzman at McDougal's conduct at the meeting, and to report that "they kept silent yesterday out of respect for you, but their silence was not tacit approval of Jim's accusations."  (Doc. Nos. DKSN 013404-DKSN 013405). Finally, consistent with Butler's recollection of the telephone call he received from Governor Clinton (described above), the memorandum states that Governor Clinton referred to McDougal at the meeting as "a friend of 20 years who had never asked for a favor." (Doc. Nos. DKSN 013404-DKSN 013405). <BR>
     *  Madison Bank & Trust should not be confused with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.  They were two different financial institutions that James McDougal controlled and operated at different times.  The potential for confusion stems from the fact that in each instance McDougal changed the name of the institution to "Madison" after he acquired control.  While the "Madison" in Madison Bank & Trust may have been selected because the bank was located in Madison County, Arkansas, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan (formerly Woodruff County Savings and Loan Association) was not in Madison County -- it was in a different part of the state altogether.  The use of a profile of President James Madison on Madison Guaranty's stationary suggests that McDougal may have selected the name of the bank because he admired President Madison.  Madison Bank employee Gary Bunch confirmed that point when he testified before the Special Committee (Bunch, 5/16/96 Hrg. p.42). <BR></P>


<P>ENDNOTES for SECTION III. part 2<BR></P>

<P>          *  Patsy Thomasson, who was working for Mr. Lasater at that time as an employee of his holding company, helped organize the fundraiser. (Thomasson, 2/23/96 Dep. pp.55-56.)  Ms. Thomasson did not work for Lasater & Co. after 1983, did not work on attempting to secure underwriting business for the firm, and did not discuss the firm with Governor Clinton's office. (Thomasson, 2/23/96 Dep. p.22; Dep. p.22; Drake, 1/24/96 Dep. pp.242-243.) <BR>
     *  It is worth noting, in light of the questions that have been raised about the oversight of Madison Guaranty by Arkansas regulatory officials, that in April 1985 the federal regulators were not overly concerned about Madison Guaranty's financial condition.  According to the April 3 memorandum, "The SA [Supervisory Agent] indicated general satisfaction with Madison's business plan as well as corrections and improvements following the last examination report except that the rapid growth has not been accompanied by proportionate increases in Net Worth." (Doc. No. 032901, John Mitchell memorandum to File.)  The memorandum also reports that: "A discussion was had regarding Madison's service corporation development projects, with which we have a reasonable comfort level."<BR>
     *  Madison Bank & Trust Company should not be confused with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.  They were two different financial institutions that James McDougal controlled and operated at different times.  The potential for confusion stems from the fact that in each instance McDougal changed the name of the institution to "Madison" after he acquired control.  While the "Madison" in Madison Bank & Trust may have been selected because the bank was located in Madison County, Arkansas, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan (formerly Woodruff County Savings and Loan Association) was not in Madison County -- it was in a different part of the state altogether.  The use of a profile of President James Madison on Madison Guaranty's stationary suggests that McDougal may have selected the name of the bank because he admired President Madison.  Madison Bank employee Gary Bunch confirmed that point when he testified before the Special Committee. (Bunch, 5/16/96 Hrg. p.42.) <BR>
     *  Whatever the exact sequence of events, it is clear that Massey was seeking to recruit Madison Guaranty as a client.  Knight recalls that Massey "came up with the idea of having John Latham to lunch" (Knight, 4/26/96 Dep. p.13) and it was Massey who "pitched the business" to Latham. Knight, 4/26/96 Hrg. pp.34-35.  Latham recalls Massey asking for work, but does not even recall Knight being present at the lunch.  (Latham, 5/16/96 Hrg. p.29.)<BR>
     *  At the May 16, 1996 hearing at which Latham and Knight testified, Majority Counsel questioned why Mrs. Clinton, rather than Knight, served as the billing partner on the engagement.  (Knight, 5/16/96 Hrg. pp.48-51.)  In fact, it makes perfect sense for Mrs. Clinton to have served as the billing partner -- it was she who had arranged the retainer agreement with McDougal that addressed the payment concerns arising out of the prior Madison Bank work.  Having met with McDougal and negotiated the retainer agreement, it is to be expected that Mrs. Clinton would serve as the billing partner and ensure that the billing procedure she had agreed upon with McDougal was followed. Knight testified that it was not unusual at the Rose Law Firm for a partner to handle billing on a matter that was outside that partner's area of expertise. (Knight, 4/24/96 Dep. p.27, as corrected by a May 16, 1996 errata submission.)<BR>
     *  The Special Committee did not subpoena James McDougal pursuant to an agreement with the Office of the Independent Office (the "OIC").  On September 21, 1995, Special Committee staff provided the OIC with a list of potential witnesses to be interviewed, deposed or examined at public hearings.  On September 27, 1995, the OIC responded to the Special Committee letter of September 21, stating, "We are particularly concerned that investigations and hearings on subject matters relating to Madison Guaranty, Whitewater and CMS would hinder or impede our investigations and prosecutions and might jeopardize the proper administration of justice in light of the pending indictment in United States v. James B. McDougal."  On October 2, 1995, Chairman Alfonse D'Amato and Ranking Member Paul Sarbanes wrote to the OIC and stated, "The Special Committee does not intend to seek the testimony of any defendant in a pending action brought by your office, nor will it seek to expand upon any of the grants of immunity provided to persons by your office or its predecessors." James McDougal, of course, was a defendant in a pending criminal action brought by the OIC. <BR>
     **  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro reached the following conclusion:<BR></P>

<P>        "First, McDougal may not be a reliable witness.  In January 1996, McDougal's psychiatrist testified that McDougal's recollections are not trustworthy, although this one might be.<BR></P>

<P>     "Second, the statement that McDougal had no specific legal work in mind when he retained the Rose Law Firm obviously is wrong.  The preferred stock issue had arisen at least a week before Mrs. Clinton met with McDougal on April 23, 1985, and work on this project began the same day as that meeting.<BR></P>

<P>     "Third, and perhaps most significantly, the alleged economic motivation makes no sense.  McDougal suggests that the Clintons needed $2,000 a month and the implication is that this accounts for the monthly retainer in that amount, but there is no evidence that the Clintons ever received anything like $2,000 a month from the engagement, and every reason to believe that they never received more than a trivial sum of money." <BR></P>

<P>     (PM&S Supplemental Rose Report, 2/25/96, p.24 (footnotes omitted).)<BR>
     *  A May 2, 1985 Madison Guaranty check for $2,000 (Doc. No. S-KCR02954) to the Rose Law Firm may be the first monthly payment under the retainer agreement.  No Madison Guaranty checks to the Rose Law Firm prior to May 2, 1985 check have been located.  <BR>
     **  It is worth noting that on at least one occasion McDougal has recanted his earlier statements about the retention of the Rose Law Firm and characterized them as a "total fabrication." ("First Lady's Former Law Aide Supports and Contradicts Her", Star Tribune, Jan. 12, 1996.) <BR>
     *  In a February 25, 1992 memorandum from Schaffer to Jeff Gerth, a reporter for The New York Times, Schaffer recalled that Assistant Securities Commissioner Nancy Jones believed that Madison Guaranty did not need to obtain approval of the ASD before operating a second-tier securities subsidiary: "In the mid-1980's, federal savings and loans were allowed to engage in securities brokerage activities.  Assistant Commissioner Nancy Jones believed that the savings and loan could engage in this activity without our prior approval.  Charles Handley and I took the position, however, that it was not a pre-approved activity and that the savings and loan could not do it without our prior approval.  Thus, we gained the necessary leverage to insist on an immediate infusion of additional capital." (Doc. Nos. 0000149, 0000155.)  Obviously, if Schaffer was seeking to give Madison Guaranty special or lenient treatment, she could simply have adopted Jones's position and permitted Madison Guaranty to go forward with the brokerage operation. As the correspondence summarized here demonstrates, however, she did the opposite.  Schaffer and Handley required Madison Guaranty to comply with every applicable regulatory requirement.  <BR>
     *  As noted above, the great majority of this work was done by Massey.  Mrs. Clinton did not play a significant role and had no personal contacts with the ASD after the initial telephone conversation with Schaffer.<BR>
     *  Documents obtained by the Special Committee confirm that state regulators kept the governor's office apprised of potential regulatory problems affecting financial institutions.  A February 19, 1986 letter to Governor Clinton from Bank Commissioner Marlin D. Jackson (Doc. No. DKSN 018001) reports on the lack of funds in the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) fund. The letter states that Jackson "shared this information only with members of the Governor's staff.  I think it is important to recognize the seriousness of the dilemma facing the Congress and the State in regard to the adequacy of the FSLIC fund." It was only some five months later that Schaffer informed the governor's office of the problems at Madison Guaranty.  Her action in doing so appears both timely and entirely appropriate in view of the problems recognized in the Jackson letter.  (Jackson's letter proved to be prescient.  As discussed below, in 1987 when Schaffer recommended to federal authorities that Madison Guaranty be closed, the FSLIC insurance fund was inadequate, and as a result the closure of the institution was delayed for almost two years.)<BR>
     *  This is the property that James and Susan McDougal purchased from International Paper Co. in October 1986 in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation without the knowledge of the Clintons.  When they purchased the property the McDougals represented to International Paper that they were the sole owners of Whitewater Development Corporation.  (PM&S Preliminary Report on Whitewater Development, 4/24/95, pp.116-122; PM&S Report on Whitewater Development, 12/13/95, pp.62-64.)  The Clintons have stated that they were unaware of the International Paper transaction.  (Interrogatory Responses of Hillary Rodham Clinton, May 24, 1995, answer to Interrogatory No. 24(c), at 59-60; Interrogatory Responses of William Jefferson Clinton, May 24, 1995, answer to Interrogatory No. 24, at 46-47.)  James McDougal did not inform the Clintons of the purchase of the International Paper property in November 1986 when he suggested that they transfer their stock in the corporation to him. (Doc. No. DKSN 010462, November 14, 1986 letter from James McDougal to Governor and Mrs. Clinton regarding status report on Whitewater Development Corporation.) <BR>
     **  As noted above, Latham also acknowledged that Arkansas savings and loan regulations would not have permitted Madison Guaranty to purchase the entire property.  (Latham, 5/15/96 Dep. pp.35-36.)<BR>
     *  The terms of the option agreement are a matter of dispute.  There are three versions of the agreement:  (1) an unsigned draft dated September 23, 1985 that Ward provided to Special Committee staff during his deposition on Feb. 12, 1996; (2) a signed version (marked "void") dated September 24, 1985, that gives Madison Financial an option on all the property Ward purchased; and (3) another signed version dated September 24, 1995, that excludes the 22.5 acres Holman Acres parcel from the option.  Ward testified that the voided version, which did not provide for the $35,000 payment and did not exclude the Holman Acres parcel from the option, did not accurately state the terms of his agreement with McDougal.  (Ward, 2/12/96 Dep. pp.21-23.)  Denton recently told FDIC investigators that he was provided a copy of the amended version, that excludes the Holman Acres property from the option, by Seth Ward on July 14, 1986. (FDIC Office of Inspector General, Interviews of Den Denton, June 3, 1996, pp.8-9 and June 11, 1996, p.6.) An unsigned copy of the amended version with a handwritten notation by Denton in the upper left corner, "Received 7-14-86 Seth," was provided to the FDIC by Denton [Document Not Numbered].  In a March 7, 1996 interview, Timothy Daters, the engineer who surveyed the IDC property, stated that the legal description of the Holman Acres property that is attached to the amended version of the September 24, 1985 letter was prepared by his firm on March 31, 1986, suggesting that the amended version was prepared some time after that date.  (FDIC Interview of Timothy Daters, 3/7/96, p.1.)  <BR>
     *  Ward later sued Madison Guaranty for commissions he claimed he was owed on sales of IDC property. Ward v. Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, No. 87-7580 (Pulaski Cty. Cir. Ct.). Relevant aspects of that litigation are discussed below.<BR>
     **  Denton has been granted immunity from prosecution by the Office of the Independent Counsel and is a cooperating witness in that investigation.  (Denton, 5/8/96 Hrg. p.48.)  There are significant differences between Denton's statements to Pillsbury Madison & Sutro in April 1994 and his statements to the FDIC in June 1996. There are also significant differences between Denton's statements to the FDIC investigators in the June 3, 1996 and June 11, 1996 interviews.  Finally, Denton's recollection, as reported in the FDIC interview memoranda, is faulty on a number of points.  For example, in his June 3, 1996 interview, Denton said that "while at Union [National Bank] he also was the loan officer on a 1978 $20,000 equity loan to [James] McDougal and Susan McDougal and William and Hillary Rodham Clinton for the purchase of the property that has come to be referred to as the Whitewater property." (FDIC-IG Interview of Don Denton, 6/3/96, p.1.)  In fact, the Union Bank loan was an unsecured personal loan to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton, and neither Mrs. McDougal or Mrs. Clinton were borrowers.  The differences and errors in these recent interview statements call into question Denton's credibility and reliability as a witness.  Some of Denton's statements, such as the statement above regarding the Whitewater loan, suggest that his present recollection may have been affected by newspaper stories or other information he has obtained since he received immunity and became a cooperating witness in the Independent Counsel's investigation.<BR>
     *  There is some evidence, discussed below, that Webster Hubbell may have been aware of the agreement between Ward and McDougal. Also, as discussed above, Don Denton recently told FDIC investigators that it is his "opinion" that Hubbell provided the non-recourse language for Ward's IDC note. (FDIC Office of Inspector General Interview of Den Denton, June 3, 1996.) It is not clear, however, what, if anything, Hubbell told others at the Rose Law Firm about the arrangement between Ward and Madison Guaranty.  <BR>
     **  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro stated that "[e]ven the change in the language from `affiliate' to `entity or individual' is not the sort of thing that would have suggested incipient wrongdoing [to the Rose Law Firm attorneys involved in the transactions]."  (PM&S Supplemental Rose Report 2/25/96, p.62.)  <BR>
     *  As PM&S observed "It is much harder to prove what other Rose Law Firm lawyers knew (if anything) about these matters.  Other than Hubbell, all of them have denied knowing the salient terms that arguably make Ward a straw."  (PM&S Supplemental Rose Report, 2/25/96, p.155.)  "No substantial evidence to the contrary has been found except possibly as to Hubbell." (Id., p.156.)  <BR>
     *  This is the legal description on the Holman Acres property that Timothy Daters told the FDIC his firm prepared on March 31, 1986, and that is attached to the amended version of the September 24, 1985 letter agreement. (FDIC interview of Timothy Daters, 3/7/96, p.1.)<BR>
     *  The Babcock matter involved a workout on a defaulted commercial loan in which Madison Guaranty had obtained a participation from Savers Savings. (See PM&S Rose Report, 12/28/95, p.39.) <BR>
     *  Document No. SW1-070 - 074 is one signed version, with a legal description of 6.667 acres in Pulaski County, Arkansas, beginning on page one and continuing to page two.  Document No. SW1-063 - 068 is another signed version, with a brief legal description reading "Part of Tracts 27 & 28, Holman Acres, Pulaski County, Arkansas," at the bottom of page one and page two apparently re-typed with the same terms as the other document, but omitting the portion of the legal description that did carry over to that page.  That version of the document also includes notarized acknowledgements for the signatures of Seth and Yvonne Anna Ward and John Latham, dated May 5, 1986.<BR>
     *  As Pillsbury Madison & Sutro observed:<BR>
    </P> 
<P>          If, instead, one credits Ward's view that the option had nothing to do with the commissions (as the jury in Ward v. Madison obviously did), then the author of the option need not have known anything about Ward's commissions, let alone his 100 percent financing or the other terms embodied in the September 24, 1985 letter.  For these reasons, the option seems, at most, tangentially related to the acquisition itself.<BR></P>

<P>     (PM&S Supplemental Rose Report, 2/25/96, p.157.)<BR>
     *  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro concluded "having reached this point, however, it must be conceded that the argument that Ward was a straw[man] is weaker . . . one must grant that Ward's recent testimony about his desire to buy the IDC property himself, and his ability to do so, might well influence a trier of fact to find that Ward was not a straw man.  Certainly a man who was ready, willing and able to buy a property, but did not do so because he recognized that he [owed] a duty of loyalty to his principal, seems much less like a straw than someone who never had the slightest interest in a property but simply was doing the bidding of another."  (PM&S Supplemental Rose Report, 2/25/96, p.149; Ward, 2/12/96 Dep. pp.112-114, 121.) <BR>
     *  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro stated that these transactions "were engineered by McDougal and exemplify the nature of Madison Guaranty's lending and investment practices during McDougal's tenure at the institution."  A Report on Certain Real Estate Loans and Investments made by Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Related Entities, ("PM&S Madison Guaranty Real Estate Report"), Prepared for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, Dec. 19, 1995, p.1.<BR>
     *  This total includes losses attributable to the February 28, 1986 Dean Paul Ltd. transaction, in which Dean Paul Ltd., a company formed by David Hale's friend and business associate Dean Paul, borrowed $825,000 from Madison Guaranty to purchase three properties from Hale at inflated prices.  Hale then used the profits from the fraudulent sale of those properties to obtain federal matching funds for his Small Business Administration investment company, Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS"), some of which allegedly were used to loan Castle Sewer and Water, Inc. $150,000 for the downpayment on the purchase of the IDC water and sewer facilities.  (A $300,000 loan by CMS to a Master Marketing, a company formed by Susan McDougal, also allegedly funded through the Dean Paul transaction.)  Dean Paul Ltd. never repaid the $825,000 loan.  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro reported that as of December 1995 the total loss to Madison Guaranty on the Dean Paul Limited loan was $1,208,640.58.  (PM&S Madison Guaranty Real Estate Report, 12/19/95, pp. 25-26.)  In another report, however, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro stated that "the RTC recovered a judgment against Dean Paul and Dean Paul, Ltd. of approximately $600,000 (net).  The judgment was sold to a joint venture in which the RTC is a venturer.  If money is collected on the judgment, the RTC will stand to benefit.  (A Supplemental Report on Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Whitewater Development Company, Inc., ("PM&S Whitewater Development Report"), Prepared for the Resolution Trust Corporation by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, Dec. 13, 1995, p.33, n.146.)    <BR>
     *     It is noteworthy that the memorandum does not make any reference to "Castle Grande." This point is discussed further below.<BR>
     *  As discussed above, Tucker had purchased 35 acres of the IDC commercial property in October 1985.<BR>
     *  As with the Donovan January 23, 1986 memorandum referenced above, it is noteworthy that this memorandum to Mrs. Clinton refers to the property as the "IDC Development," consistent with other evidence collected by the Special Committee indicating that the property that Seth Ward optioned to Madison Financial was not known as "Castle Grande" at the time the Rose Law Firm was doing legal work for Madison Guaranty.<BR>
     *  On January 18, 1996, during the testimony of Ronald Clark, the Chief Operating Officer of the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Clark was questioned about what appeared to be a Rose Law Firm invoice that had a handwritten "CG" on it.  (Clark, 1/18/96 Hrg. pp.108-116.)  Majority Counsel questioned whether this invoice indicated that within the Rose Law Firm the term "Castle Grande" had been used, contrary to the prior statement of Mrs. Clinton that she did not work on Castle Grande.  (Rose Law Firm Voucher # V 4372 for Madison Financial Corporation) At that time Mr. Clark was unsure what the invoice represented. <BR></P>

<P>     The question was answered in January 31, 1996 letter to the Special Committee from Mr. Clark.  He explained that he saw the "CG" invoice for the first time during the January 18 hearing, then went on to state: "After reviewing the document further, it appears that the voucher actually was photocopied while laying on top of a Rose Law Firm invoice, thus creating a single paper with the voucher on top half and an incomplete copy of the Rose Law Firm invoice on the bottom of the page.  I have consulted with our accounting department, and I am told that we did not use documents like this in 1985-1986 (as we do not today)."  In addition, Mr. Clark's letter stated, "I believe this document is not from the Rose Law Firm but instead probably is an internal document from Madison Guaranty or Madison Financial."  (January 31, 1996 Letter from Ron Clark to Chairman Alfonse D'Amato and Ranking Member Senator Paul Sarbanes, Special Committee; see also Rose Law Firm Billing Records, Matter #5 I.D.C.: DKSN 028930; DKSN 028979; DKSN 028980; DKSN 029011 through DKSN 029020; FDIC Interview of Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2/14/96, p.50.)<BR>
     *  See, e.g., Mary Hargrove, Don Johnson, Michael Whiteley, "They Called It Castle Grande," Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Aug. 30, 1994.  Even the reports prepared by Pillsbury Madison & Sutro refer to the entire IDC parcel as Castle Grande.  See, e.g., "A Report on Certain Real Estate Loans and Investments Made by Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Related Entities," Dec. 19, 1995, p.7.    <BR>
     *  A letter Hale's lawyer sent to the Committee on June 6, 1996 referred to Hale's concerns about unspecified federal prosecutions in addition to his concerns about state prosecutions.  (June 6, 1996 letter from John A. Mintz to Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes).  Since Hale's plea agreement with the Independent Counsel limits Hale's protection from federal prosecutions to federal crimes Hale disclosed before March 19, 1994, the letter from Hale's lawyer raised the question whether Hale has committed additional crimes, as yet undisclosed, that would be effectively excused by a grant of blanket use immunity.<BR>
     *  "On February 4, 1994, the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") issued an Order of Investigation in the matter of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan . . . . The Order was issued consistent with 12 U.S.C.  1441a(b)(14), as modified by the RTC Completion Act of 1993 Public Law 103-204.  That statute extended the limitations period applicable to RTC claims arising from fraud, intentional misconduct resulting in unjust enrichment and intentional misconduct resulting in substantial losses to the institution." (General Report On The Investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan And Related Entities, Prepared for the Resolution Trust Corporation by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, December 28, 1995, p.1.)<BR>
     *  During the Special Committee's hearings an issue arose concerning Mrs. Clinton's description of her work for Madison Guaranty as a "minimal amount." (Senator Shelby, 1/11/96 Hrg. pp. 96-97; Hillary Rodham Clinton Whitewater Press Conference, April 22, 1994.)  Comparing Mrs. Clinton's Madison Guaranty billings with the billings by Jay Stephens on the PM&S investigation sheds some light on this issue.  Stephens testified that he did "minimal" work on the PM&S investigation of Madison Guaranty, but his billing records show that he billed 339.75 hours over 12 months, or an average of 28.3 hours per month. (Stephens, 5/17/96 Hrg. pp.41-45; April 30, 1996 FDIC letter, Alice C. Goodman to Chairman Alfonse D'Amato and Senator Paul Sarbanes, attaching billing statements submitted to the RTC by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro [Documents Not Numbered].)  Mrs. Clinton in contrast, billed 63.5 hours over 15 months, or an average of 4.23 hours per month.  The fact that Mr. Stephens testified under oath that his work was "minimal" in amount, when the records of the time he billed to the government show he did far more work in 1994 and 1995 than Mrs. Clinton did in 1985 and 1986, demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton's description of her work for Madison Guaranty as "minimal" is fair and accurate. (Id.)  (The comparison also suggests that Mrs. Clinton's critics may be applying a double-standard in an effort to score political points.)<BR>
     *  When Ericson, Patterson, and Stephens appeared before the Special Committee at a public hearing on May 17, 1996, the Majority asserted that, in light of Stephens's limited involvement in the PM&S investigation, the numerous press accounts which reported that the PM&S investigation was spearheaded by Stephens and referred to the reports collectively as the "Stephens Report" were unfair and inaccurate. (At that hearing the Majority Chief Counsel stated that a computer search had yielded 429 news stories associating the PM&S report with Stephens. (Giuffra, 5/17/96 Hrg. p.7).)  Stephens testified that he had expressed to his partners "some concern . . . that I was getting the credit or blame for the reports, since I hadn't written the reports." (Stephens, 5/17/96 Hrg. p.9).  While Stephens's role may have been overstated by the news media, it is not surprising that the press and the public focused on Stephens.  As a former federal prosecutor who had brought high-profile cases in Washington, D.C., and had considered seeking the Republican nomination for the United States Senate from Virginia, his involvement in an investigation of matters relating to a Democratic President naturally was the subject of considerable media attention. (See, e.g., Stephens, 5/17/96 Hrg. pp.38-40; "Stephens Considers a Senate Race; Former U.S. Attorney May Seek GOP Nomination in Virginia", The Washington Post, 5/15/93; "Ex-Prosecutor Stephens Quits Va. Senate Race", The Washington Post, Jan. 7, 1994.) Press reports at the time of the retention of PM&S by the RTC focused on Stephens's involvement in the investigation and on concerns allegedly raised at the time by some Clinton Administration officials about Stephens's partisan identification.  (See, e.g., "RTC Lawyer Drew White House Ire; Clinton Aides Questioned Hiring", The Washington Post, 3/26/94.)  After these initial reports, Stephens's name continued to be linked with the PM&S investigation in press reports, and it is to be expected that the press and others, who had no way of knowing that his role had diminished, continued to associate Stephens with the investigation.  The Committee found no evidence that the RTC misrepresented Stephens's role or sought to misuse the fact of his participation.<BR>
     *  The Majority's report emphasizes information recently provided to FDIC investigators by former Madison Guaranty loan officer Don Denton.  (FDIC Office of Inspector General Interviews of Don Denton, June 3 and June 11, 1996 [Documents Not Numbered].)  Pillsbury Madison & Sutro interviewed Denton in April 1994.  (Doc. Nos. SEN 21633 - SEN 21648, Interview of Don Denton, April 28, 1994.)  There are significant differences between Denton's statements to Pillsbury Madison & Sutro in April 1994 and his statements to the FDIC in June 1996.  There are also significant differences between the June 3, 1996 and June 11, 1996 FDIC interview memoranda.  These differing versions of statements to federal investigators call into question Denton's credibility and reliability as a witness.<BR>
     *  See, e.g., "Report on Arkansas S&L backs up Clintons on Whitewater", The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, June 26, 1995; "Whitewater Report Supports Clintons", Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, June 27, 1995. <BR>
     *  As noted above, the Majority report emphasizes information Don Denton recently provided to FDIC investigators. (FDIC Office of Inspector General, Interviews of Don Denton, June 3 and June 11, 1996 [Documents Not Numbered].)  That information was not available when the PM&S attorneys testified before the Special Committee, although PM&S attorneys had interviewed Denton in April 1994 and been told that Denton was not aware of any involvement by Rose Law Firm attorneys in the IDC transactions.  Denton, who has been given immunity by the Office of Independent Counsel and is now a cooperating witness in that investigation, apparently has now changed his story from what he told PM&S in 1994.<BR></P>

<H3>ENDNOTES FOR IV.  FOSTER PHASE</H3>


<P>     *  It is difficult to square the Independent Counsel's unwillingness to make available the FBI polygraph of Ms. Williams or the FBI notes of Officer O'Neill's interviews with his willingness to provide the Committee with FBI work product regarding fingerprint analysis of the Rose Law Firm billing records.  See below.<BR>
     **  Officer O'Neill worked a full shift at the White House on July 22, 1995.  Ms. Williams testified that she accompanied Thomas Castleton as he carried a box of files out of the White House Counsel's suite that day.  See below.<BR>
     ***  The eventual release of the FBI reports of the series of interviews of Officer O'Neill presently withheld by the Independent Counsel may shed further light on the reliability of Officer O'Neill's testimony. <BR>
            Mr. Nussbaum testified that he called Mr. Heymann:  "I thought there might be multiple requests for information, so I called Mr. Heymann...and asked if the Justice Department would agree to coordinate the investigations of Foster's death."  (Nussbaum, 8/9 Hrg. p.14).<BR>
            See (Doc. Nos.DKSN 028928- DKSN 29043, Rose Law Firm Billing Records.)  The documents reflect time billed by Rose Law Firm personnel Becky Arnold, Les Baledge, Kevin Burns, Hillary Clinton, Rick Donovan, Watt Gregory III, Sharon Grimes, William Kennedy, David Knight, Rick Massey, Chet Roberts, Herb Rule, Gary Speed, R. Davis Thomas Jr., and Thomas Thrash.<BR>
     **  The documents show Mrs. Clinton billed an additional 3.7 hours to the Madison Guaranty General matter on March 16, 1987.  By way of comparison, Jay Stephens billed 339.75 hours to Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro's investigation of Madison Guaranty for the Resolution Trust Corporation over a 12 month period at a cost of some $67,950 to the government.  Mr. Stephens testified that his involvement was "minimal" after March 1994 during which he billed 193 hours over 10 months. (Stephens, 5/17/96 Hrg. pp.42-44.)<BR>
     *  Ms. Huber also identified Vincent Foster's handwriting on the documents in red ink. (Huber, 1/18/96 Hrg. p.25.)<BR>
     *  The only other fingerprints the FBI identified on the documents were those of Marc Rolfe, an employee of Mr. Kendall's law firm, Williams & Connolly.<BR>

<P><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></P>

<P>Procedural Background</P>

<P>Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency Act
of 1996 (CDA or "the Act"), which constitutes Title V of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, signed into law by the President on February 8, 1996.(1) 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, Section 502, 110 Stat. 56,
133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations and individuals who, inter
alia, are associated with the computer and/or communications industries, or who
publish or post materials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen groups. 
See ACLU Complaint (Paragraphs 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint (Paragraphs 3,
12-33).</P>

<P>The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the
United States, and the United States Department of Justice.  For convenience, we
will refer to these defendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the
two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to communications over
the Internet which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
minors, defined as persons under the age of eighteen, infringe upon rights
protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which the lead plaintiff is the
American Civil Liberties Union (the ACLU),(2) filed their action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the
Act was signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15, 1996, following
an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, to whom the case had been
assigned, granted a limited temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum
that 47 U.S.C. Section 223(a)(1)(B) ("the indecency provision" of the CDA) was
unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter,
Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, having
been requested by the parties and the district court to convene a three-judge
court, pursuant to Section 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a court consisting
of, in addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of the same district,
and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C. Section 2284.</P>

<P>After a conference with the court, the parties entered into a stipulation, which
the court approved on February 26, 1996, wherein the Attorney General agreed
that: she will not initiate any investigations or prosecutions for violations of
47 U.S.C. Section 223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision
until the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction
. . . and has decided the motion.</P>

<P>The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:</P>

<P>her full authority to investigate or prosecute any violation of Section
223(a)(1)(B), as amended, and Section 223(d) as to conduct which occurs or
occurred during any period of time after enactment of these provisions
(including for the period of time to which this stipulation applies) should the
Court deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is granted, should these
provisions ultimately be upheld.</P>

<P>Stipulation, Paragraph 4, in C.A. No. 96-963.</P>

<P>Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association, Inc. (the ALA) and
others(3) filed a similar action at C.A. No. 96-1458.  On February 27, 1996,
Chief Judge Sloviter, again pursuant to Section 561(a) of the CDA and upon
request, convened the same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2284.
The actions were consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), "for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary injunction in
these cases, including the hearing on such motions."</P>

<P>The parties were afforded expedited discovery in connection with the motions for
preliminary injunction, and they cooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been
assigned the case management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court began receiving
evidence at the consolidated hearings which were conducted on March 21 and 22,
and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In order to expedite the proceedings, the parties
worked closely with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before the court by
sworn declarations, so that the hearings were largely devoted to
cross-examination of certain of the witnesses whose declarations had been filed.
The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on
April 29, and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.(4)</P>


<P>Statutory Provisions at Issue</P>

<P>Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions of section 502 of the CDA
which amend 47 U.S.C. Sections 223(a) and 223(d).</P>

<P>Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person in interstate or foreign
communications who, "by means of a telecommunications device,"(5) "knowingly...
makes, creates, or solicits" and "initiates the transmission" of "any comment,
request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication which is obscene or
indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18 years of
age," "shall be criminally fined or imprisoned." (emphasis added).</P>

<P>Section 223(d)(1) ("the patently offensive provision"), makes it a crime to use
an "interactive computer service"(6) to "send" or "display in a manner
available" to a person under age 18, "any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such
service placed the call or initiated the communication."</P>

<P>Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the provisions in Section
223(a)(2) and Section 223(d)(2), which make it a crime for anyone to "knowingly
permit[] any telecommunications facility under [his or her] control to be used
for any activity prohibited" in Sections 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1). The
challenged provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the statute to the extent
that it covers obscenity or child pornography, which were already proscribed
before the CDA's adoption.  See 18 U.S.C. Sections 1464-65 (criminalizing
obscene material); id. Sections 2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography); see
also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15
(1973). Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge the provision of the CDA
that criminalizes speech over the Internet that transmits information about
abortions or abortifacient drugs and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C.
Section 1462(c).  That section now prohibits the sending and receiving of
information over the Internet by any means regarding "where, how, or of whom, or
by what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or
intended for producing abortion] may be obtained or made". The Government has
stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of
the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c).(7)</P>

<P>As part of its argument that the CDA passes constitutional muster, the
Government cites the CDA's "safe harbor" defenses in new Section 223(e) of 47
U.S.C., which provides:</P>


<P>(e) Defenses</P>

<P>In addition to any other defenses available by law:</P>

<P>(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) of this
section solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system,
or network not under that person's control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the
creation of the content of the communication.</P>

<P>(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in
the creation or knowing distribution of communications that violate this
section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.</P>

<P>(3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who provides access or connection to a facility, system,
or network engaged in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled
by such person.</P>

<P>(4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for the actions of an
employee or agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is within the scope
of his or her employment or agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of such
conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly disregards such
conduct.</P>

<P>(5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of this
section, or under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the use of a
facility for an activity under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --</P>

<P>(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication specified in such subsections, which may involve any appropriate
measures to restrict minors from such communications, including any method which
is feasible under available technology; or</P>

<P>(B) has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a verified
credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.</P>

<P>(6) The [Federal Communications] Commission may describe measures which are
reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited
communications under subsection (d) of this section.  Nothing in this section
authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to provide the Commission
with the authority to approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such measures.
The Commission shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize
such measures. . . .</P>


<P>II.</P>

<P><H3>FINDINGS OF FACT</H3></P>

<P>All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal questions at issue in
these cases, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the exponentially
growing, worldwide medium that is the Internet, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and due process
requirements to this new and evolving method of communication.  For this reason
all parties insisted on having extensive evidentiary hearings before the
three-judge court. The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are not in
dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following Findings of fact
are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of a stipulation(8) the parties
filed with the court.(9)</P>


<P>The Nature of Cyberspace</P>

<P>The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</P>

<P>1. The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant network
which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer networks.  It
is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one considers what a
linked group of computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what it
does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called "local area
networks").  For example, in many United States Courthouses, computers are
linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging files and messages (and to
share equipment such as printers).  These are networks.</P>

<P>2. Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to other computers or
networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks, which are in
turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each computer in any
network to communicate with computers on any other network in the system.  This
global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to as the Internet.</P>

<P>3. The nature of the Internet is such that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
however, that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.
 In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over 1,000,000 computers
were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers worldwide, of which
approximately 60 percent located within the United States, are estimated to be
linked to the Internet.  This count does not include the personal computers
people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all, reasonable estimates
are that as many as 40 million people around the world can and do access the
enormously flexible communication Internet medium.  That figure is expected to
grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.</P>

<P>4. Some of the computers and computer networks that make up the Internet are
owned by governmental and public institutions, some are owned by non-profit
organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or "cyberspace" -- that links
people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.  The
Internet is an international system.  This communications medium allows any of
the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange
information. These communications can occur almost instantaneously, and can be
directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of people interested
in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.</P>

<P>5. The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
Advanced Research Project Agency ("ARPA"), and was called ARPANET. This network
linked computers and computer networks owned by the military, defense
contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related research. 
The network later allowed researchers across the country to access directly and
to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key universities and
laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in the United
States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the world, the
ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just the "Internet."</P>

<P>6. From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized,
self-maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer
networks, capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system of linked computers was
designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if portions
of the network were damaged, say, in a war.</P>

<P>7. To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global) communications
medium, the ARPANET encouraged the creation of multiple links to and from each
computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated telephone lines) to
other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard. Each of those
computers could in turn be linked to other computers, which themselves would be
linked to other computers.</P>

<P>8. A communication sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message sent from
a computer in Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might
first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a computer
in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City, before finally
reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that path (because of
military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message
would automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be re-routed,
perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then to Atlanta, New Orleans,
Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo Alto.  This type of
transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in a matter of seconds.</P>

<P>9. Messages between computers on the Internet do not necessarily travel entirely
along the same path.  The Internet uses "packet switching" communication
protocols that allow individual messages to be subdivided into smaller "packets"
that are then sent independently to the destination, and are then automatically
reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all packets of a given message
often travel along the same path to the destination, if computers along the
route become overloaded, then packets can be re-routed to less loaded computers.</P>

<P>10. At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it subsequently ceased to
exist), similar networks developed to link universities, research facilities,
businesses, and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. Eventually, each of these
networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked together, allowing
users of any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series of
linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
today commonly known as the Internet.</P>

<P>11. No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
administers the Internet.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact that
hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks
independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange
communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
communications and information with still other computers).  There is no
centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.</P>


<P>How Individuals Access the Internet</P>

<P>12. Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in general,
and the Internet in particular.  In terms of physical access, there are two
common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can use
a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually permanently)
connected to a computer network that is itself directly or indirectly connected
to the Internet. Second, one can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to
connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As detailed below,
both direct and modem connections are made available to people by a wide variety
of academic, governmental, or commercial entities.</P>

<P>13. Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast majority
of colleges and universities in the United States can access the Internet
through their educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices, or computer
centers, or may be through telephone access using a modem from a student's or
professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges and universities
install "ports" or outlets for direct network connections in each dormitory room
or provide access via computers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such
access enables students and professors to use information and content provided
by the college or university itself, and to use the vast amount of research
resources and other information available on the Internet worldwide.</P>

<P>14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are sufficiently important to many
corporations and other employers that those employers link their office computer
networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to
the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be used by,
for example, a corporation involved in scientific or medical research or
manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and ideas
with academic researchers in their fields.</P>

<P>15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through their schools or employers
still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many communities
across the country have established "free-nets" or community networks to provide
their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to provide local-oriented
content and discussion groups).  The first such community network, the Cleveland
Free-Net Community Computer System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now
exist in scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee,
Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego, California. Individuals typically
can access free-nets at little or no cost via modem connection or by using
computers available in community buildings. Free-nets are often operated by a
local library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.</P>

<P>16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through many local libraries.
Libraries often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the Internet.
In addition, some libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.  Increasingly,
patrons now use library services and resources without ever physically entering
the library itself.  Libraries typically provide such direct or modem access at
no cost to the individual user.</P>

<P>17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by patronizing an increasing
number of storefront "computer coffee shops," where customers -- while they
drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the
Internet.  Such Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee.</P>

<P>18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through commercial and
non-commercial "Internet service providers" that typically offer modem telephone
access to a computer or computer network linked to the Internet.  Many such
providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange
Association -- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a monthly or
hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however, are non-profit
organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet.  For
example, the International Internet Association offers free modem access to the
Internet upon request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit associations
offer Internet access as a service to members.</P>

<P>19.  Another common way for individuals to access the Internet is through one of
the major national commercial "online services" such as America Online,
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online services offer
nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized content
within their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing access
to the extensive content available within each online service, the services also
allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained
for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online services have
almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United States.</P>

<P>20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services, individuals
can also access the Internet using some (but not all) of the thousands of local
dial-in computer services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs." 
With an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a telephone line,
individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses can offer
their own dial-in computer "bulletin board" service where friends, members,
subscribers, or customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer (allowing only
one user at a time), to single computers with many telephone lines into the
computer (allowing multiple simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers
each servicing multiple dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous
users).  Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect links
to the Internet. Some BBS systems charge users a nominal fee for access, while
many others are free to the individual users.</P>

<P>21. Although commercial access to the Internet is growing rapidly, many users of
the Internet -- such as college students and staff -- do not individually pay
for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of computer
services is a component of college tuition). These and other Internet users can
access the Internet without paying for such access with a credit card or other
form of payment.</P>


<P>Methods to Communicate Over the Internet</P>

<P>22.  Once one has access to the Internet, there are a wide variety of different
methods of communication and information exchange over the network. These many
methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly evolving and
are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common methods of
communications on the Internet (as well as within the major online services) can
be roughly grouped into six categories:</P>

<P>(1) one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),</P>

<P>(2) one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"),</P>

<P>(3) distributed message databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"),</P>

<P>(4) real time communication (such as "Internet Relay Chat"),</P>

<P>(5) real time remote computer utilization (such as "telnet"), and</P>

<P>(6) remote information retrieval (such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide
Web").</P>

<P>Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmit text, data,
computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e., pictures), and moving video
images.</P>

<P>23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet is via
electronic mail, or "e-mail," comparable in principle to sending a first class
letter. One can address and transmit a message to one or more other people. 
E-mail on the Internet is not routed through a central control point, and can
take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple
e-mail generally is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed on
intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the message is
encrypted).</P>

<P>24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains automatic mailing list
services (such as "listservs"), [also referred to by witnesses as "mail
exploders"] that allow communications about particular subjects of interest to a
group of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a "listserv" mailing list
on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can submit messages
on the topic to the listserv that are forwarded (via e-mail), either
automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to anyone
who has subscribed to the mailing list. A recipient of such a message can reply
to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the mailing
list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of developments or
events in a particular subject area. Most listserv-type mailing lists
automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list subscribers. 
There are thousands of such mailing list services on the Internet, collectively
with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users of "open" listservs typically
can add or remove their names from the mailing list automatically, with no
direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be "closed," i.e., only allowing
for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human moderator.</P>

<P>25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  User-sponsored newsgroups are among the
most popular and widespread applications of Internet services, and cover all
imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups are open
discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need not
subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead access the
database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups are "moderated" but most are open
access.  For the moderated newsgroups,(10) all messages to the newsgroup are
forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the topics under
discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer to peer
connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET "servers")
around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual user with
access to a USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that furnish access to
the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those
servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,
where they are available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time
to make room for new messages.  Responses to messages, like the original
messages, are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the
newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup.  The
dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated
process that does not require direct human intervention or review. 26. There are
newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects.</P>

<P>In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups each day, and
those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
computer networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once the
messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer
networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or computer
networks. Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or "articles") are posted
to newsgroups each day.</P>

<P>27.  Real time communication.  In addition to transmitting messages that can be
later read or accessed, individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate
dialog, in "real time", with other people on the Internet. In its simplest
forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and "Internet Relay Chat" (or
IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each other that almost immediately
appear on the others' computer screens.  IRC is analogous to a telephone party
line, using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone. With IRC, however,
at any one time there are thousands of different party lines available, in which
collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging in conversations on a huge
range of subjects.  Moreover, one can create a new party line to discuss a
different topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are "moderated" or include
"channel operators."</P>

<P>28. In addition, commercial online services such as America Online, CompuServe,
the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systems allowing their
members to converse.</P>

<P>29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another method to use information
on the Internet is to access and control remote computers in "real time" using
"telnet."  For example, using telnet, a researcher at a university would be able
to use the computing power of a supercomputer located at a different university.
 A student can use telnet to connect to a remote library to access the library's
online card catalog program.</P>

<P>30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major category of communication
may be the most well known use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval
of information located on remote computers.  There are three primary methods to
locate and retrieve information on the Internet.</P>

<P>31. A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list the names of
computer files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one or more of
those files to an individual's local computer.</P>

<P>32. Another approach uses a program and format named "gopher" to guide an
individual's search through the resources available on a remote computer.</P>


<P>The World Wide Web</P>

<P>33. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet, is
the "World Wide Web."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language called
hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web can display
HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and moving video.  Any
HTML document can include links to other types of information or resources, so
that while viewing an HTML document that, for example, describes resources
available on the Internet, one can "click" using a computer mouse on the
description of the resource and be immediately connected to the resource itself.
 Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be accessed and organized in very
flexible ways, and allow people to locate and efficiently view related
information even if the information is stored on numerous computers all around
the world.</P>

<P>34. Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform for
a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity of
sources and accessible to Internet users around the world.  Though information
on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each of these
computers is connected to the Internet through W3C protocols allows all of the
information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is currently the
most advanced information system developed on the Internet, and embraces within
its data model most information in previous networked information systems such
as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.</P>

<P>35. History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN, the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted
much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other areas which
depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web has extended beyond
the scientific and academic community to include communications by individuals,
non-profit organizations, and businesses.</P>

<P>36. Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
different computers all over the Internet.  Documents contain information stored
in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An
essential element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather like a
telephone number). Most Web documents contain "links."  These are short sections
of text or image which refer to another document. Typically the linked text is
blue or underlined when displayed, and when selected by the user, the referenced
document is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it actually is
stored.  Links for example are used to lead from overview documents to more
detailed documents, from tables of contents to particular pages, but also as
cross-references, footnotes, and new forms of information structure.</P>

<P>37. Many organizations now have "home pages" on the Web. These are documents
which provide a set of links designed to represent the organization, and through
links from the home page, guide the user directly or indirectly to information
about or relevant to that organization. 38. As an example of the use of links,
if these Findings were to be put on a World Wide Web site, its home page might
contain links such as those:</P>

<P>*  THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE</P>

<P>*  CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE</P>

<P>*  HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET</P>

<P>*  METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET</P>

<P>39. Each of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links may also
take the user from the original Web site to another Web site on another computer
connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to another, from one
document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into a single
body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a
maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.</P>

<P>40. Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform through
which people and organizations can communicate through shared information.  When
information is made available, it is said to be "published" on the Web.
Publishing on the Web simply requires that the "publisher" has a computer
connected to the Internet and that the computer is running W3C server software. 
The computer can be as simple as a small personal computer costing less than
$1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar mainframe computer.  Many
Web publishers choose instead to lease disk storage space from someone else who
has the necessary computer facilities, eliminating the need for actually owning
any equipment oneself.</P>

<P>41. The Web, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a variety
of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the hastily typed
idea, to the professionally executed corporate profile.  The power of the Web
stems from the ability of a link to point to any document, regardless of its
status or physical location.</P>

<P>42. Information to be published on the Web must also be formatted according to
the rules of the Web standards. These standardized formats assure that all Web
users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web standards are
sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet the publishing
needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses, newspapers and
magazines which now publish "online" editions of their material, as well as
government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web to disseminate
information to the public. At the same time, Web publishing is simple enough
that thousands of individual users and small community organizations are using
the Web to publish their own personal "home pages," the equivalent of
individualized newsletters about that person or organization, which are
available to everyone on the Web.</P>

<P>43. Web publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
pool of all Internet users, or close them, thus making the information
accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to
keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case of
Web sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access will only be
allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.(11)</P>

<P>44. Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have developed that allow users of
the Web to search particular information among all of the public sites that are
part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler, and
Lycos are all services known as "search engines" which allow users to search for
Web sites that contain certain categories of information, or to search for key
words.  For example, a Web user looking for the text of Supreme Court opinions
would type the words "Supreme Court" into a search engine, and then be presented
with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain Supreme Court information. 
This list would actually be a series of links to those sites.  Having searched
out a number of sites that might contain the desired information, the user would
then follow individual links, browsing through the information on each site,
until the desired material is found.  For many content providers on the Web, the
ability to be found by these search engines is very important.</P>

<P>45. Common standards.  The Web links together disparate information on an
ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information
storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic Web standards
provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and exchange of
information.  Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on the Web,
and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise incompatible, those who
"publish" information on the Web are able to communicate with those who seek to
access information with little difficulty because of these basic technical
standards.</P>

<P>46. A distributed system with no centralized control. Running on tens of
thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the Web is what is known as a
distributed system. The Web was designed so that organizations with computers
containing information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Web software.  No
single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any single
centralized point from which individual Web sites or services can be blocked
from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control point.</P>

<P>47. Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed, decentralized
nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that have come
before it. Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis, and
Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed from
the Internet with the appropriate passwords and access software.  However, these
databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is the World Wide Web.</P>

<P>48. Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities. The
World Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web environment makes it
easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
token, the open nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer each
potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.</P>


<P>Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material(12)</P>

<P>PICS</P>

<P>49. With the rapid growth of the Internet, the increasing popularity of the Web,
and the existence of material online that some parents may consider
inappropriate for their children, various entities have begun to build systems
intended to enable parents to control the material which comes into their homes
and may be accessible to their children.  The World Wide Web Consortium launched
the PICS ("Platform for Internet Content Selection") program in order to develop
technical standards that would support parents' ability to filter and screen
material that their children see on the Web.</P>

<P>50. The Consortium intends that PICS will provide the ability for third parties,
as well as individual content providers, to rate content on the Internet in a
variety of ways.  When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World Wide Web
browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications, will
provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating services, or a
combination of services.</P>

<P>51. PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants include many of the major online
services providers, commercial internet access providers, hardware and software
companies, major internet content providers, and consumer organizations. Among
active participants in the PICS effort are:</P>

<P>Adobe Systems, Inc. Apple Computer America Online AT&T Center for Democracy and
Technology CompuServe Delphi Internet Services Digital Equipment Corporation IBM
First floor First Virtual Holdings Incorporated France Telecom FTP Software
Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan Information Technology
Association of America Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en
Automatique (INRIA) Interactive Services Association MCI Microsoft MIT/LCS/World
Wide Web Consortium NCD NEC Netscape Communications Corporation NewView O'Reilly
and Associates Open Market Prodigy Services Company Progressive Networks
Providence Systems/Parental Guidance Recreational Software Advisory Council
SafeSurf SoftQuad, Inc. Songline Studios Spyglass SurfWatch Software Telequip
Corp. Time Warner Pathfinder Viacom Nickelodeon(13)</P>

<P>52. Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies from
the computer, communications, and content industries, as well as trade
associations and public interest groups.  PICS technical specifications have
been agreed to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products and
services based on the PICS-standards.</P>

<P>53. Until a majority of sites on the Internet have been rated by a PICS rating
service, PICS will initially function as a "positive" ratings system in which
only those sites that have been rated will be displayed using PICS compatible
software.  In other words, PICS will initially function as a site inclusion list
rather than a site exclusion list.  The default configuration for a PICS
compatible Internet application will be to block access to all sites which have
not been rated by a PICS rating service, while allowing access to sites which
have a PICS rating for appropriate content.(14)</P>


<P>Software</P>

<P>54. For over a year, various companies have marketed stand alone software that
is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet access of
children.  Examples of such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The
Internet Filter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy Server,
and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software is growing, and there is
increasing competition among software providers to provide products.</P>


<P>Cyber Patrol</P>

<P>55. As more people, particularly children, began to use the Internet,
Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to develop and market Internet software
intended to empower parents to exercise individual choice over what material
their children could access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop a
product which would give parents comfort that their children can reap the
benefits of the Internet while shielding them from objectionable or otherwise
inappropriate materials based on the parents' own particular tastes and values.
Microsystems' product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.</P>

<P>56. Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995, and is currently available
in Windows and Macintosh versions. Cyber Patrol works with both direct Internet
Access providers (ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and Commercial Online Service
Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy, Microsoft).  Cyber Patrol
is also compatible with all major World Wide Web browsers on the market (e.g.,
Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic, Prodigy's Legacy and Skimmer browsers, America
Online, Netcom's NetCruiser, etc.). Cyber Patrol was the first parental
empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS standard.  In February of
1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratings server on the Internet.</P>

<P>57. The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000 sites in twelve categories. 
The software is designed to enable parents to selectively block access to any or
all of the twelve CyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes in the Cyber
Patrol Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  These categories are:</P>

<P>Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or emotional acts against any
animal or person which are primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses George Carlin's seven
censored words more often than once every fifty messages or pages.</P>

<P>Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human anatomy except when
exposing genitalia.</P>

<P>Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.</P>

<P>Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text exposing anyone or anything
involved in explicit sexual acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and involving nude or partially
nude people in heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual encounters.  Also
includes phone sex ads, dating services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.</P>

<P>Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or descriptive text of anyone or
anything which are crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or showing
scatological impropriety.  Includes such depictions as maiming, bloody figures,
indecent depiction of bodily functions.</P>

<P>Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination against any race or
ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one
race over another.</P>

<P>Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil, wickedness.  Sects or
groups that potentially coerce individuals to grow, and keep, membership.</P>

<P>Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of illegal drugs for
entertainment.  This would exclude current illegal drugs used for medicinal
purposes (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes substances used
for other than their primary purpose to alter the individual's state of mind
such as glue sniffing.</P>

<P>Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative behaviors, radicalism,
advocacy of extreme political measures.  Topics include extreme political groups
that advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.</P>

<P>Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos, betting, numbers games, on-line
sports or financial betting including non-monetary dares.</P>

<P>Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a dubious nature which may be
illegal in any or all jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.</P>

<P>Alcohol, Beer & Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale or consumption of
alcoholic beverages.  Also includes sites and information relating to tobacco
products.</P>

<P>58. Microsystems employs people to search the Internet for sites containing
material in these categories.  Since new sites are constantly coming online,
Microsystems updates the CyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the
home PC, the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to the CyberNOT
list over the Internet every seven days.</P>

<P>59. In February of 1996, Microsystems signed a licensing arrangement with
CompuServe, one of the leading commercial online services with over 4.3 million
subscribers. CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to its subscribers.
 Microsystems the same month signed a licensing arrangement with Prodigy,
another leading commercial online service with over 1.4 million subscribers. 
Prodigy will provide Cyber Patrol free of charge of its subscribers.</P>

<P>60. Cyber Patrol is also available directly from Microsystems for $49.95, which
includes a six month subscription to the CyberNOT blocked sites list (updated
automatically once every seven days).  After six months, parents can receive six
months of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for $29.95.  Cyber
Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of Cyber Patrol, is available free of
charge on the Internet.  To obtain either version, parents download a seven day
demonstration version of the full Cyber Patrol product from the Microsystems
Internet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven day trial period, users
are offered the opportunity to purchase the complete version of Cyber Patrol or
provide Microsystems some basic demographic information in exchange for
unlimited use of the Home Edition.  The demographic information is used for
marketing and research purposes. Since January of 1996, over 10,000
demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloaded from Microsystems' Web
site.</P>

<P>61. Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outlets as NetBlocker Plus.
NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, which includes five weeks of updates to the
CyberNOT list.</P>

<P>62. Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into a growing market in schools. As
more classrooms become connected to the Internet, many teachers want to ensure
that their students can receive the benefit of the Internet without encountering
material they deem educationally inappropriate.</P>

<P>63. Microsystems is working with the Recreational Software Advisory Council
(RSAC), a non-profit corporation which developed rating systems for video games,
to implement the RSAC rating system for the Internet.</P>

<P>64. The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected in second quarter of this year,
will give parents the ability to use any PICS rating service, including the RSAC
rating service, in addition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.</P>

<P>65. In order to speed the implementation of PICS and encourage the development
of PICS-compatible Internet applications, Microsystems maintains a server on the
Internet which contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides software
developers with access to a PICS rating service, and allows software developers
to test their products' ability to interpret standard PICS labels. Microsystems
is also offering its PICS client test program for Windows free of charge.  The
client program can be used by developers of PICS rating services to test their
services and products.</P>


<P>SurfWatch</P>

<P>66. Another software product, SurfWatch, is also designed to allow parents and
other concerned users to filter unwanted material on the Internet. SurfWatch is
available for both Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Windows 95
Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet Access Providers (e.g.,
Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&T, and more than 1000 other Internet Service Providers).</P>

<P>67. The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Software is $49.95, with a street
price of between $20.00 and $25.00. The product is also available as part of
CompuServe/Spry Inc.'s Internet in a Box for Kids, which includes access to
Spry's Kids only Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch. Internet in a Box for
Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscription service, which updates
the SurfWatch blocked site list automatically with new sites each month, is
available for $5.95 per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is included
as part of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is also provided as a
low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.</P>

<P>68. SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including National
stores such as Comp USA, Egghead Software, Computer City, and several national
mail order outlets.  SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its own site on
the World Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.</P>

<P>69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), Microsoft Network, and Prodigy all offer
parental control options free of charge to their members.  AOL has established
an online area designed specifically for children.  The "Kids Only" parental
control feature allows parents to establish an AOL account for their children
that accesses only the Kids Only channel on America Online.(15)</P>

<P>70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatible capability into its standard Web
browser software, and to make available to subscribers other PICS-compatible Web
browsers, such as the Netscape software.</P>

<P>71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give their subscribers the option of
blocking all access to the Internet, or to particular media within their
proprietary online content, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms.</P>

<P>72. Although parental control software currently can screen for certain
suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it cannot now screen for
sexually explicit images unaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who
configure the software are aware of the particular site.</P>

<P>73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software suggests
that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their children
from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is
inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.</P>


<P>Content on the Internet</P>

<P>74. The types of content now on the Internet defy easy classification.  The
entire card catalogue of the Carnegie Library is on-line, together with
journals, journal abstracts, popular magazines, and titles of compact discs. The
director of the Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-line
services are the emerging trend in libraries generally.  Plaintiff Hotwired
Ventures LLC organizes its Web site into information regarding travel, news and
commentary, arts and entertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff
America Online, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety of topics,
but also allows members to create their own chat rooms to suit their own tastes.
 The ACLU uses an America Online chat room as an unmoderated forum for people to
debate civil liberties issues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,(16) estimated
that 15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interest in a
newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  America Online makes 15,000
bulletin boards available to its subscribers, who post between 200,000 and
250,000 messages each day.  Another plaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold,
participates in "virtual communities" that simulate social interaction.  It is
no exaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet is as diverse as
human thought.</P>

<P>75. The Internet is not exclusively, or even primarily, a means of commercial
communication.  Many commercial entities maintain Web sites to inform potential
consumers about their goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but many
other Web sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercial
information.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-mail, bulletin
boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequently have non-commercial goals.  For
the economic and technical reasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the
Internet is an especially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or public
interest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There are examples in the
parties' stipulation of some of the non-commercial uses that the Internet
serves.  Plaintiff Human Rights Watch, Inc., offers information on its Internet
site regarding reported human rights abuses around the world.  Plaintiff
National Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues of concern to
them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text, graphics, and statistics
regarding the incidence and prevention of rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical
Path AIDS Project, Inc., offers information on safer sex, the transmission of
HIV, and the treatment of AIDS.</P>

<P>76. Such diversity of content on the Internet is possible because the Internet
provides an easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large audience,
potentially of millions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed by
communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those associated with
use of other forms of mass communication, such as television, radio, newspapers,
and magazines.  This enables operation of their own Web sites not only by large
companies, such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit
groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS Project.  The
Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,(17) agreed that creation of a Web site
would cost between $1,000 and $15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on
one's goals and the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as
America Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free of charge.  Any
Internet user can communicate by posting a message to one of the thousands of
newsgroups and bulletin boards or by engaging in an on-line "chat", and thereby
reach an audience worldwide that shares an interest in a particular topic.</P>

<P>77.  The ease of communication through the Internet is facilitated by the use of
hypertext markup language (HTML), which allows for the creation of "hyperlinks"
or "links". HTML enables a user to jump from one source to other related sources
by clicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web site to Web site,
or to other files within a particular Web site.  Similarly, by typing a request
into a search engine, a user can retrieve many different sources of content
related to the search that the creators of the engine have collected.</P>

<P>78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet, the statutory term
"content provider,"(18) which is equivalent to the traditional "speaker," may
actually be a hybrid of speakers.  Through the use of HTML, for example,
Critical Path and Stop Prisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related
databases, and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of these
organizations to the related databases simply by clicking on a link.  America
Online creates chat rooms for particular discussions but also allows subscribers
to create their own chat rooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a
particular topic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Users of
the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fair and Playboy, and
America Online's subscribers can peruse the New York Times, Boating, and other
periodicals. Critical Path, Stop Prisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie
Library all make available content of other speakers over whom they have little
or no editorial control.</P>

<P>79.  Because of the different forms of Internet communication, a user of the
Internet may speak or listen interchangeably, blurring the distinction between
"speakers" and "listeners" on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroups
are interactive forms of communication, providing the user with the opportunity
both to speak and to listen.</P>

<P>80. It follows that unlike traditional media, the barriers to entry as a speaker
on the Internet do not differ significantly from the barriers to entry as a
listener. Once one has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue that
occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and does become the
content provider, and vice-versa.</P>

<P>81. The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human
communication.</P>


<P>Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet</P>

<P>82. The parties agree that sexually explicit material exists on the Internet. 
Such material includes text, pictures, and chat, and includes bulletin boards,
newsgroups, and the other forms of Internet communication, and extends from the
modestly titillating to the hardest-core.</P>

<P>83. There is no evidence that sexually-oriented material is the primary type of
content on this new medium.  Purveyors of such material take advantage of the
same ease of access available to all users of the Internet, including
establishment of a Web site.</P>

<P>84. Sexually explicit material is created, named, and posted in the same manner
as material that is not sexually explicit.  It is possible that a search engine
can accidentally retrieve material of a sexual nature through an imprecise
search, as demonstrated at the hearing. Imprecise searches may also retrieve
irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  The accidental retrieval of
sexually explicit material is one manifestation of the larger phenomenon of
irrelevant search results.</P>

<P>85. Once a provider posts content on the Internet, it is available to all other
Internet users worldwide. Similarly, once a user posts a message to a newsgroup
or bulletin board, that message becomes available to all subscribers to that
newsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when the UCR/California Museum of
Photography posts to its Web site nudes by Edward Weston and Robert Mapplethorpe
to announce that its new exhibit will travel to Baltimore and New York City,
those images are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and New York
City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- wherever Internet users
live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to its Web
site, written in street language so that the teenage receiver can understand
them, are available not just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and Prague.  A
chat room organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States Supreme Court's 
decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit George Carlin's seven
dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages posted to a newsgroup dedicated to
the Oklahoma City bombing travel to all subscribers to that newsgroup.</P>

<P>86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet, it cannot prevent that
content from entering any community. Unlike the newspaper, broadcast station, or
cable system, Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a potential
worldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network of networks (as described
above in Findings 1 through 4), any network connected to the Internet has the
capacity to send and receive information to any other network.  Hotwired
Ventures, for example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.</P>

<P>87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunction hearings showed that it takes
several steps to enter cyberspace.  At the most fundamental level, a user must
have access to a computer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically by
way of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect with the
access provider, enter a password, and enter the appropriate commands to find
particular data.  On the World Wide Web, a user must normally use a search
engine or enter an appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups,
bulletin boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.</P>

<P>88. Communications over the Internet do not "invade" an individual's home or
appear on one's computer screen unbidden.  Users seldom encounter content "by
accident." A document's title or a description of the document will usually
appear before the document itself takes the step needed to view it, and in many
cases the user will receive detailed information about a site's content before
he or she need take the step to access the document.  Almost all sexually
explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the content.  Even the
Government's witness, Agent Howard Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of
Special Investigation, testified that the "odds are slim" that a user would come
across a sexually explicit site by accident.</P>

<P>89. Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant differences between
Internet communications and communications received by radio or television.
Although content on the Internet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the
user,  the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.  A
child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material
and thereby to use the Internet unattended.</P>


<P>Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet</P>

<P>90.  There is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a user
who is accessing material through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat
rooms.  An e-mail address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail "alias" or an anonymous remailer. There is also
no universal or reliable listing of e-mail addresses and corresponding names or
telephone numbers, and any such listing would be or rapidly become incomplete. 
For these reasons, there is no reliable way in many instances for a sender to
know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor. The difficulty of e-mail
age verification is compounded for mail exploders such as listservs, which
automatically send information to all e-mail addresses on a sender's list. 
Government expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a
speaker assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail exploder's
mailing list.</P>

<P>91.  Because of similar technological difficulties, individuals posting a
message to a newsgroup or engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that
all readers are adults, and Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are
moderated, the moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.</P>

<P>92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to ensure
that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age. The
Government presented no evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its suggestion
that chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material deemed indecent
could be effectively segregated to "adult" or "moderated" areas of cyberspace.</P>

<P>93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block minors' access to
newsgroups and similar fora, there is no method by which the creators of
newsgroups which contain discussions of art, politics or any other subject that
could potentially elicit "indecent" contributions could limit the blocking of
access by minors to such "indecent" material and still allow them access to the
remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of that content was not
indecent.</P>

<P>94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and  MUSEs (Multi-User
Simulation Environments) do not know whether the other participants are adults
or minors. Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their age, and there
is no current technology to enable the administrator of these fantasy worlds to
know if the participant is an adult or a minor.</P>

<P>95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the Internet, there is technology by
which an operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a user of a Web
site.  An HTML document can include a fill-in-the-blank "form" to request
information from a visitor to a Web site, and this information can be
transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by a computer program,
usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi) script.  The Web server could then
grant or deny access to the information sought.  The cgi script is the means by
which a Web site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit card number or adult password.</P>

<P>96.  Content providers who publish on the World Wide Web via one of the large
commercial online services, such as America Online or CompuServe, could not use
an online age verification system that requires cgi script because the server
software of these online services available to subscribers cannot process cgi
scripts.  There is no method currently available for Web page publishers who
lack access to cgi scripts to screen recipients online for age.</P>


<P>The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses</P>

<P>Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes available three potential defenses
to all content providers on the Internet:  credit card verification, adult
verification by password or adult identification number, and "tagging".</P>


<P>Credit Card Verification</P>

<P>97.  Verification(19) of a credit card number over the Internet is not now
technically possible.  Witnesses testified that neither Visa nor Mastercard
considers the Internet to be sufficiently secure under the current technology to
process transactions in that manner. Although users can and do purchase products
over the Internet by transmitting their credit card number, the seller must then
process the transaction with Visa or Mastercard off-line using phone lines in
the traditional way.  There was testimony by several witnesses that Visa and
Mastercard are in the process of developing means of credit card verification
over the Internet.</P>

<P>98. Verification by credit card, if and when operational, will remain
economically and practically unavailable for many of the non-commercial
plaintiffs in these actions. The Government's expert "suspect[ed]" that
verification agencies would decline to process a card unless it accompanied a
commercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.</P>

<P>99. There was evidence that the fee charged by verification agencies to process
a card, whether for a purchase or not, will preclude use of the credit-card
verification defense by many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites, and there was
no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell Warren, an
author whose free Web site allows users to purchase gay and lesbian literature,
testified that she must pay $1 per verification to a verification agency.  Her
Web site can absorb this cost because it arises in connection with the sale of
books available there.</P>

<P>100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for age, and requiring use of a
credit card to enter a site, would impose a significant economic cost on
non-commercial entities.  Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily
from February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay a fee every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.  The ACLU's Barry Steinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit
card verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site would require
it to shut down its Web site because the projected cost would exceed its budget.</P>

<P>101. Credit card verification would significantly delay the retrieval of
information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, the expert testifying for the
Government, agreed that even "a minute is [an] absolutely unreasonable [delay] .
. . [P]eople will not put up with a minute."  Plaintiffs' expert Donna Hoffman
similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the "flow" on the Internet and
stifles both "hedonistic" and "goal-directed" browsing.</P>

<P>102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement would completely bar adults who do
not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any
blocked material.  At this time, credit card verification is effectively
unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as a potential
defense to the CDA.</P>


<P>Adult Verification by Password</P>

<P>103.  The Government offered very limited evidence regarding the operation of
existing age verification systems, and the evidence offered was not based on
personal knowledge.  AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be
used for accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users for their
services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of these services was derived
primarily from reading the advertisements on their Web pages.  He had not
interviewed any employees of these entities, had not personally used these
systems, had no idea how many people are registered with them, and could not
testify to the reliability of their attempt at age verification. 104.  At least
some, if not almost all, non-commercial organizations, such as the ACLU, Stop
Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard charging listeners to access
their speech as contrary to their goals of making their materials available to a
wide audience free of charge.</P>

<P>105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercial organizations to design
their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative burden
of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved is
beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be prohibitive
even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the online version of Wired
magazine.</P>

<P>106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required use of
a credit card or password.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received
many complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system, which
requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address and self-created
password. There is concern by commercial content providers that age verification
requirements would decrease advertising and revenue because advertisers depend
on a demonstration that the sites are widely available and frequently visited.</P>

<P>107.  Even if credit card verification or adult password verification were
implemented, the Government presented no testimony as to how such systems could
ensure that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The
burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification
systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet
content providers.</P>


<P>The Government's "Tagging" Proposal</P>

<P>108. The feasibility and effectiveness of "tagging" to restrict children from
accessing "indecent" speech, as proposed by the Government has not been
established. "Tagging" would require content providers to label all of their
"indecent" or "patently offensive" material by imbedding a string of characters,
such as "XXX," in either the URL or HTML.  If a user could install software on
his or her computer to recognize the "XXX" tag, the user could screen out any
content with that tag.  Dr. Olsen proposed a "-L18" tag, an idea he developed
for this hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that certain
tagging would not be feasible.</P>

<P>109. The parties appear to agree that it is technologically feasible --
"trivial", in the words of plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML,
and the technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposal and the
Government's "-L18" proposal.</P>

<P>110. The Government's tagging proposal would require all content providers that
post arguably "indecent" material to review all of their online content, a task
that would be extremely burdensome for organizations that provide large amounts
of material online which cannot afford to pay a large staff to review all of
that material.  The Carnegie Library would be required to hire numerous
additional employees to review its on-line files at an extremely high cost to
its limited budget.  The cost and effort would be substantial for the Library
and frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya testified that
it would be impossible for his organization, Critical Path, to review all of its
material because it has only one full and one part-time employee.</P>

<P>111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done simply by using software
which screens for certain words, as Dr. Olsen acknowledged, and we find that
determinations as to what is indecent require human judgment.</P>

<P>112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a content provider could tag
its entire site but this would prevent minors from accessing much material that
is not "indecent" under the CDA.</P>

<P>113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18 proposal would require a
worldwide consensus among speakers to use the same tag to label "indecent"
material.  There is currently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker
currently labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other
widely-recognized label.</P>

<P>114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software that recognizes the tags and
takes appropriate action when it notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial Web
browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block a
-L18 code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internet will continue
to travel to whomever requests it, without hindrance.  Labelling speech has no
effect in itself on the transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither
plaintiffs nor the Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors
from speech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under the CDA. It
follows that all speech on any topic that is available to adults will also be
available to children using the Internet (unless it is blocked by screening
software running on the computer the child is using).</P>

<P>115. There is no way that a speaker can use current technology to know if a
listener is using screening software.</P>

<P>116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate themselves depending on the
age or location of the receiver.  Critical Path, which posts on-line safer sex
instructions, would be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in
communities where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, for example,
must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech in all communities) or
not to tag, blocking its speech in none.</P>


<P>The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching</P>

<P>117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of content on the Internet
originates outside the United States.  At the hearing, a witness demonstrated
how an Internet user could access a Web site of London (which presumably is on a
server in England), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  A user
can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from overseas, since
InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed a country code in a domain name.(20)
 Foreign content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content (as long
as it is in English), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted in the
same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that foreign speech
contain a country code in its URL.  It is undisputed that some foreign speech
that travels over the Internet is sexually explicit.</P>

<P>118. The use of "caching" makes it difficult to determine whether the material
originated from foreign or domestic sources.  Because of the high cost of using
the trans- Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high demand on
those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often "cached", or
temporarily stored, on servers in the United States.  Material from a foreign
source in Europe can travel over the trans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the
United States, and pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a
copy for subsequent retrieval. This domestic caching server, rather than the
original foreign server, will send the material from the cache to the subsequent
receivers, without placing a demand on the trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut
effectively eliminates most of the distance for both the request and the
information and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a certain time or
as the demand for the information diminishes).  Caching therefore advances core
Internet values:  the cheap and speedy retrieval of information.</P>

<P>119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon. Domestic content
providers store popular domestic material on their caching servers to avoid the
delay of successive searches for the same material and to decrease the demand on
their Internet connection.  America Online can cache the home page of the New
York Times on its servers when a subscriber first requests it, so that
subsequent subscribers who make the same request will receive the same home
page, but from America Online's caching service rather than from the New York
Times's server.(21)</P>

<P>120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior paragraph, America Online
has no control over the content that the New York Times posts to its Web site,
and the New York Times has no control over America Online's distribution of that
content from a caching server.</P>


<P>Anonymity</P>

<P>121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek to access sensitive
information, such as users of the Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, the
users, particularly gay youth, of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop
Prisoner Rape (SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.</P>


<P>Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA</P>

<P>122. Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on the Internet must
choose between silence and the risk of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses --
credit card verification, adult access codes, and adult personal identification
numbers -- are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.</P>

<P>123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses, libraries, non-commercial
and not-for-profit organizations, and educational societies and consortia. 
Although some of the material that plaintiffs post online -- such as information
regarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape -- is sexually
explicit and may be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some
communities, none of the plaintiffs is a commercial purveyor of what is commonly
termed "pornography."</P>


<P>III.</P>

<P><H3>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</H3></P>

<P>Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability of eventual success in the
litigation by demonstrating that Sections 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of the CDA
are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach indecency. 
Sections 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face. 
Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no party has any interest
in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and therefore the public interest
will be served by granting the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.
347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493
U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994). 
The motions for preliminary injunction will therefore be granted.</P>

<P>The views of the members of the Court in support of these conclusions follow.</P>

<P>(5)The Act does not define "telecommunications device".  By Order dated February
27, 1996, we asked the parties to address whether a modem is a
"telecommunications device". Plaintiffs and the Government answered in the
affirmative, and we agree that the plain meaning of the phrase and the
legislative history of the Act strongly support their conclusion. 
"Telecommunications" under 47 U.S.C. Section 153(48) means "the transmission,
between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user's
choosing, without change in the form of content of the information as sent and
received."  The plain meaning of "device" is "something that is formed or
formulated by design and usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives,
experiment, and testing."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 618
(1986). Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought it would reach individual
Internet users, many of whom still connect through modems. See, e.g., 141 Cong.
Rec. S8329-46 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen.
Coats).</P>

<P>The resolution of the tension between the scope of "telecommunications device"
and the scope of "interactive computer service" as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section
230(a)(2), see infra note 6, must await another day.  It is sufficient for us to
conclude that the exclusion of Section 223(h)(1)(B) is probably a narrow one (as
the Government has argued), insulating an interactive computer service from
criminal liability under the CDA but not insulating users who traffic in
indecent and patently offensive materials on the Internet through those
services.</P>

<P>(6)The statute at Section 509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add Section 230(e)(2), which
defines such a service as "any information service, system, or access software
provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access
to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or
educational institutions."</P>

<P>(7)In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes "the Department has a
longstanding policy that previous such provisions are unconstitutional and will
not be enforced", and that both President Clinton and General Reno "have made
th[e] point clear" that no one will be prosecuted under "the abortion-related
provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c)." Opposition at 19, n.11
(February 14, 1996).  In view of this "longstanding policy", the Government
contends there is no realistic fear of prosecution and, so the argument goes, no
need for equitable relief.  Id.  In their post-hearing brief, the ACLU
plaintiffs inform us that in view of the Government's statement, "they do not
seek a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Section 1462(c)." 
Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs at 2 n.2.</P>

<P>(8)The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties for their
cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.</P>

<P>(9)The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff in
either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own on that point, notwithstanding
the Government's suggestion in a footnote of its post-hearing brief.  See
Defendants' Post-Hearing Memorandum at 37 n.46 ("Plaintiffs' assertions as to
the speech at issue are so off-point as to raise standing concerns."). 
Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature and content of the
speech they contend is or may be affected by the CDA, are set forth in
paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30 through 103 of the parties' stipulation
filed in these actions.  These paragraphs will not be reproduced here, but will
be deemed adopted as Findings of the court.</P>

<P>(10)It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups are the
exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.</P>

<P>(11)The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this paragraph of
the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.</P>

<P>(12)Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces exist to limit
the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate for
their children. Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of so-called
"parental empowerment" software, there is a sufficiently wide zone of agreement
on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites that the parties were
able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated facts on the subject,
which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our Findings of fact. 
Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some of the technological
facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the time of publication of
these Findings.</P>

<P>(13)This membership is constantly growing, according to the testimony of Albert
Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium.  See also Defendants' Ex.
D-167.</P>

<P>(14)See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr. Vezza.</P>

<P>(15) From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer based upon the
parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced at the hearings.</P>

<P>(16)Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the group
primarily responsible for Internet technical standards, as well as other
Internet-related associations responsible for, among other things, the
prevailing Internet Protocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.</P>

<P>(17)Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University
in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointed Director of the Human Computer
Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P>(18)The term "information content provider" is defined in Section 509 of the
CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C. Section 230(e)(3), as "any person or entity that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information
provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service."</P>

<P>(19)By "verification", we mean the method by which a user types in his or her
credit card number, and the Web site ensures that the credit card is valid
before it allows the user to enter the site.</P>

<P>(20)InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of content.  InterNIC and
two other European organizations maintain a master list of domain names to
ensure that no duplication occurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their
domain name with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web site has the name of an already-existing site.
InterNIC has no control over content on a site after registration.</P>

<P>(21)This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustrate that a content
provider might store its own material or someone else's on a caching server. 
The goal -- saving money and time -- is the same in both cases.</P>

I don't know if Congress intentionally passed a law itknew to be unconstitutional  (don't they still take oaths to defend theConstitution?), however,  in this, a national election year, the plaintiffs didnot decline to suggest Congress was motivated not only by good (if notmisguided) cyberintentions, namely the desire to make the electronic world safeas a sandbox for children, but also by a degree of, shall we say,self-interest.<p> At a press conference this morning Ira Glasser, executive director of the ACLUsaid passage of the CDA was "a political stunt" and concluded that "the court'sdecision exposed it as such."<p> Perhaps.  In any case, politically motivated legislation can still move digitalmountains. The DOJ has said it will keep its foot on the CDA gas pedal (Ibelieve it has 20 days to file notice of appeal).

Butperhaps the decision's greatest and most lasting contribution -- in this andother areas of First Amendment law -- will be Judge Buckwalter's condemnation ofthe terms "indecency," "in context" and "patently offensive" on vaguenessgrounds.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Michael Perlin -- New York Law School - New York<br> Date: Wed Jun 12 14:27:59 1996<br> Subject: Sorry, gang . . .<p> but I'm gonna wait a while before I break out the bottle of cyberchampagne.

Assume that Stevens, Breyer, Ginsberg &Souter will vote to affirm, and that Rehnquist and Thomas will vote to reverse(I am deferring on Scalia til I read the whole thing). That leaves O'Connor andKennedy as unknowns.

But the fact is that, legally, this is an easy case. That a ban on"indecent" speech is void for vagueness is simply a no-brainer. Everyone knewthis law was unconstitutional when it was passed. All the language about thenature of the medium is fascinating and eloquent, but in the end dicta. There'sno need for the high court to take this case and retrace this panel's, ahem,footprints.<p> The tougher question is what community standards should apply to "obscene"speech on the Internet.

And perhaps at leastone other  leaning-to-affirm justice will take the position that, if the Courtdoesn't act, Congress will pass another similar bill w/different-but-equally-ambiguous language so as to force the First Amendmentdefenders into another long and costly and draining court battle. That perhapswould be heard by a panel w/o a judge as intelligent and thoughtful as DorisSloviter (who is the only one of the three on the 3d Circuit panel w/ whose opinions I'm familiar)...<p> <hr><p><P>From: David Post -- Georgetown Law Ctr. - Washington<BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 11:37:56 1996<BR>Subject: Supremes</P><P>First off, I am not 100% sure that DOJ will appeal to the Supreme Court [thoughthe statute gives them the right to do so].  The forcefulness of the threeopinions, and the fact that no member of the panel really thought that this waseven a close case, might give them pause, at least as a strictly legal matter. It's hard to see what stone the lower court left unturned, or what the DOJ mightpersuasively argue in trying to persuade the Supremes to reverse. Of course thiedecision whether or not to appeal will not be made on narrow legal grounds --nor should it be, in my view.  The Administration finds itself in an interestingposition here -- this is *not* the statute that the Administration might havepreferred, and yet they are, of course, charged with its enforcement (and withits defense in court).  Having done their duty and presented the court with thebest arguments in support of constitutionality, I think they are clearlyentitled to make a 'political' judgment about whether they should continue thisbattle, or give up now.  And as far as vote-counting goes -- I'm not persuadedthat this one falls out on simple liberal/conservative lines at all, i.e. thatThomas, for example, can be expected to vote for reversal.  Michael P. maysuggest that Scalia would take the opportunity to 'lecture' about the 1stAmendment -- but in others' view (my own included) Scalia may well be thestrongest 1st Amendment defender on the Court today.  If *anyone* is a possiblevote to reverse I'd look to Stevens, actually --  David </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Michael Perlin -- New York Law School - New York <BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 12:04:36 1996<BR> Subject: David, there's no inconsistency </P><P>betwn our posts... having reflected on the flag burning case, I can see Scaliaaffirming this one w/ all guns blazing. OTOH, that dsnt cut agst what I said:that this is too good of a potential forum for him to pass up the opportunity toilluminate to the rest of us just what the real issues are. My comment was noton Scalia's judicial politix but on his inability -- or so it seems to me -- tolet *any* opportunity pass w/o him telling the rest of us how much smarter andmore erudite he is than we are (cf Burnham v Burnham; cf Romer; cf Penry, etcetc etc). </P><P>Interesting at Stevens as a possible reverse vote.. lemme cogitate on that onefor a while. </P><P>PS To David: Can u coerce/cajole Gene & Larry into joining us here? </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Marc Chafetz -- Law Office - Washington <BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 12:23:57 1996 <BR>Subject: am I the only one? </P><P>Is anyone really surprised by this decision?

I'm not sure if there's </P><P>been a thread anywhere on LCC (I was off line for 8 days in the past 2 weeks andam nowhere near caught up) on Judge Sarokin's resignation. Sarokin said,basically, that he decided to quit the bench when he started thinking, as he waswriting an opinion, as to the damaging political spins that could be put on it.And of course, Sen. Dole responded in his Nixonian mode by saying  tersely,"Byebye." </P><P>After thinking abt that, i guess I am *always* gonna be surprised when *any*judge takes an unpopular, countermajoritarian position in any case w hipublicity potential... And that's a pity. </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Linda Greenhouse -- NY Times - Washington <BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 22:13:44 1996 <BR>Subject: not a cert </P><P>FYI, this case doesn't go up on cert at  all -- it's a special mandatory appeal,so if DOJ does file a jurisdictional statement, the Court has to rule on themerits -- as in Turner Broadcasting (juris. noted for the 1996 term).  The Courtdoesn't have to give plenary review,  but a summary affirmance is a judgment onthe merits. </P><P>I'd be shocked if the Administration didn't appeal, given the subject matter --remember how burned they got early in the game when  a bevy of CongressionalRepublicans was able to characterize the SG's  position in the Knox case as softon kid porn. </P><P>As to vote counting, there's a definite libertarian appeal to free speech on theInternet -- I wouldn't rule out Thomas, let alone Scalia. (See Thomas'sconcurrence in 44 Liquormart, admittedly commercial speech, but a verylibertarian 1st amendment position). </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Mark Pruner -- Atty-M. Pruner - Riverside <BR>Date: Fri Jun 14 12:20:21 1996 <BR>Subject: Clinton should appeal </P><P>From a political viewpoint, it would be better for Clinton if DOJ does appeal. Clinton is clearly moving to the right to try to capture as many votes aspossible.  His rhetoric on the CDA and gay marriage certainly shows him tryingto move towards the Christian right.  An appeal of the CDA decision will get himmore votes on conservative side than he will lose on the liberal side, since theonly viable alternative, Dole, is unattractive to liberals. </P><P>One way to sugar coat this position for the liberals, would be to argue that itis very likely that the decision would be upheld.  The appeal then can beportrayed as making the 1st Amendment protection even more effective, since weare going to lose anyway. </P><P>Of course the fly in this salve, is that who knows how the digitally homelessSupremes are going to decide.  The first amendment should mean what it says, butthe Justices could analogize to TV regulation, the cases on advertising on thesubway, and the limitations of the public display of adult magazines and cobbletogether an opinion that equates surfing the web to channel surfing TV andpeople should be protected from having indecent material shoved in their face. The findings of facts in the opinion should be very helpful to the opponents ofthe CDA.   </P><P>One Internet aspect that the findings of facts gloss over is that the Internetis not one medium, but several media.  The web, ftp and IRC/CUSeeMe chats areall very different ways to communicate.  The judges made a big deal, as theyshould, that different media require different regulatory schemes; they glossedover the differences when it came to analyzing various ways that TCP/IP packets(the Internet) can be used to communicate. </P><P>Another area that received little attention, was the abortion languageprohibition, the judges accepted at face value that the DOJ would not bring anyprosecutions under the amended 18 USC 1462(c), because DOJ has a policy thatsuch provisions are unconstitutional and will not be enforced [fn7 of CJSloviter's opinion].  I'd feel a lot more comfortable if they had taken care ofthat section at the same time.  (It would have been interesting if AG Reno hadapplied the same reasoning to the whole CDA.)  Hopefully, the final injunctionwill resolve this issue.  </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Robert Hamilton -- Jones Day - Columbus <BR>Date: Fri Jun 14 14:47:08 1996 <BR>Subject: Unconstitutional </P><P>(My earlier posts didn't make it this board, but most of them were covered byothers anyway....) </P><P>Affirmance by the Supreme Court, while likely, is only a small part of thepicture.  Many of us who have been following, speaking, working on this issuefor the past year have always thought the real battle will be CDA-2, whichCongress passes after the Supreme Court rules on CDA-1.  For example, if a CDA-2incorporated a "harmful to minors" standard rather than an indecency/patentlyoffensive standard, would it pass 1st Am muster?  Clearly not according toDalzell, but perhaps so for Buckwalter.  What really matters is on what basisthe Supreme Court affirms.  Predicting that is a lot harder than counting votesfor affirmance or reversal. </P><P><HR><P><P> Appended by: Eugene Volokh -- UCLA Law School - Los Angeles <BR>Date: Fri Jun 1417:28:14 1996<BR> Subject: S Ct will affirm </P><P>I agree with Robert Hamilton:  The real question is with the future CDA II.  Ithink this case is a 9-0 affirm, simply because it's at least as strong a freespeech case as Sable Communications. </P><P>I must also demur slightly from the "first amendment should mean what it says"argument mentioned a few posts back.  I'm generally a free speech hawk, and Icare a lot about what text says, but clearly the 1st Am can't be read to mean"Congress may not regulate speech at all."  If it did, then that would be theend of copyright law, federal laws barring extortion and terroristic threats(either interstate/ mail or in federal enclaves), and so on.  (Also note thatthe 1st Am says "Congress"; does that mean it shouldn't cover executive orjudicial conduct?) </P><P>One could say, of course, as some have, that the 1st Am means what it says, butit protects only "the freedom of speech," which is a term of art referring to aparticular level of freedom for a particular category (albeit perhaps a verybroad one) of speech.  That can satisfy the textualist concerns, but of courseit tells us little about what the actual protection would be. </P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I><A HREF="comform.html">Submit yourquestion or comment to the discussion</i>.</a></p><P><I>To look up theemail address of the lawyers participating in this discussion, use ouronline directory of attorneys, <a href="http://www.counsel.com/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</a>. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P ALIGN=CENTER>  <IMG SRC="/spotlight/telecom/disclaim.gif" ALT="All Materials  Copyright 1996 Counsel Connect.

Second, the decision isobviously significant in that it puts Net communication somewhere closer to the"print" box, and farther from the "broadcasting" box, for purposes of FirstAmendment analysis.  But more interesting [to me], is that it appears torecognize that the Net may need, if you will, its own box -- that narrowlytailoring legislation to regulate communications on this medium is going to haveto take the uniqueness of Net communication into account.  This is a principlethat is of importance outside of the First Amendment context -- though how thetranslation to other legal questions will operate I wouldn't dare opine about atthis point.  But this could be an important moment in the history of the legalsystem's struggle to understand and deal with this new phenomenon.<p>David<p><hr><p> Appended by: Jessica Londin -- Counsel Connect - New York<br> Date: Wed Jun 12 12:52:09 1996<br> Subject: Figuring it out<p> I agree, David, that this court appears to have done its homework.<p> We don't know what, if anything, our esteemed Supreme Court  justices understandabout the Internet, so it's good to see in this decision many pages of findingsof fact about the nature of the medium Congress appears willing to rush inhalf-blind to regulate.

F.C.C.  This is the challengeto the provision of the 1992 cable act that puts cable operators to the choiceof banning "indecent"  programming or scrambling the signal for subscribers whodon't request access in writing.  Obviously, this does not come up in thecontext of the internet, but it does require the Court to balance the FirstAmendment interests against the Government's asserted interest in the welfare ofchildren. The Court's next opinion day is Thurs., 6/13.<p><hr><p><P>From: David Post -- Georgetown Law Ctr. - Washington<BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 11:27:17 1996<BR>Subject: Indecency and Vagueness</P><P>Two of the panel judges (Sloviter and Buckwalter) appear to hold that the"indecency" standard in the CDA is unconstitutionally vague; Dalzell, in hisabsoutely extraordinary opinion, disagrees. But keep in mind that the CDAimposed criminal penalties for transmitting indecent material, and that thecourt here stressed the higher standard it would apply to determinations ofvagueness in that context; not clear, at least to me, how relevant thisreasoning will be for indecency regulation in the admininstrative/civil context.David </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: David Post -- Georgetown Law Ctr. - Washington <BR>Date: Thu Jun 13 11:50:15 1996 <BR>Subject: Prediction </P><P>Not about what the Supreme Courtmight do with this [see the other thread forthoughts on this] but in a broader context.  I confess that my view for sometime has been that this case was a bit of a sideshow -- that there were far moreimportant issues for those of us interested in the developing law of cyberspacethan the control of obscene or indecent material, and that the obsessive focusthat many people on the Net had on this case was giving support to the(misguided) view that the 1st amendment of the US COnstitution is the governinglegal rule for the worldwide network. But I'm now (slightly) abashed.  Havingnow read the opinions over fairly closely, the entire document is really quiteextraordinary -- an eloquent defense not merely of the 1st Amendment narrowlyconstrued, but of the concept of freedom of expression AND of the remarkablenature of the new communications medium.  Judge Dalzell, in particular, "getsit"  -- the discussion of the democratizing, chaotic, and cacophanous nature ofNet communication is a real marvel.  My prediction is that this opinion will,properly, be viewed as a landmark, down the road, marking  the moment that anofficial organ of the US government acknowledges publicly that the Net is aunique development in human history, and one that the governments of the worldare going to have great difficulty controlling using the traditional methodsthat may have served in the past.

I get the distinct impressionthat they were designed not only to insulate the decision from reversal, but toserve as a primer for the Supremes.  IMHO, the 9 justices in DC are the onlypeople in the free world that would need such a detailed explanation.

But one little fly inthis ointment:  under 1st Amendment jurisprudence, as I understand it, appellatecourts are supposed to review factual findings de novo.  This rule was designedto strengthen 1st Amendment protections, to insure that factual findings don'tbecome a shield behind which trial court judges or juries could hide theirantipathy to unpopular expression -- but could the rule backfire here?

But, frankly, I don't think there was any downside to making suchdetailed factual findings, especially given the Court's representation that manyof the findings were stipulated to. </P><P>I say there is no downside because without any findings or inadquate findings,the Supreme Court would have to begin its review, assuming there is a review,without a coherent presentation of the Internet and they will reverse findingsof fact or no findings of fact. I, for one, would much rather have the recordcontain the excellent job the panel did with the findings than to proceedwithout them. It seems to me, that the better the record, the harder job theSupreme Court will have to justify a reversal. </P><P>Barry</P> <P ALIGN=CENTER><I><A HREF="comform.html">Submit yourquestion or comment to the discussion</i>.</a></p><P><I>To look up theemail address of the lawyers participating in this discussion, use ouronline directory of attorneys, <a href="http://www.counsel.com/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</a>. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P ALIGN=CENTER>  <IMG SRC="/spotlight/telecom/disclaim.gif" ALT="All Materials  Copyright 1996 Counsel Connect.

If the DOJ appeals, I suspect the Court will set it for oralargument, but I think it'll be a 9-0 affirm. </P><P>The harder question, I think, would be what the courts would do with (1) arating requirement for (2) harmful-to-minors material (recall that the HTM testis the three-prong obscenity test with each prong modified to have a "forminors" component). </P><P>I say this is a hard question for four reasons.  First, it's much more clearthat *minors* may be denied access to HTM material (see Ginsberg v. New York)than to indecent material -- even post-Sable, one can credibly argue that minorscan't be shielded from some forms of indecent matter (as one of the opinionsbelow suggests). </P><P>Second, Sable Communications DOES strongly suggest that a ban on certain speechaimed at minors would be permissible even if it has considerable spillover onadults.  The question under Sable, it seems to me, is only whether the spilloveris greater than necessary.  If it turns out that some spillover is indeednecessary -- i.e., that any alternative would protect children considerably lessthan the prohibition would -- then, under Sable and under general strictscrutiny theory the law ought to pass muster.  (I recognize that Butler v.Michigan points in the other direction, which is why I think the question ishard; for the record, I think Butler's rule -- that if there's enough spilloveron adults the law is impermissible even if it's the most effective way ofshielding children -- is the better one.) </P><P>This is where the ratings requirement can change the analysis.  In my view(which I document further in a forthcoming piece in the U Chi Legal Forum), somesort of a ratings requirement would be an equally effective but less restrictivealternative to a total ban.  I'm not sure, though, whether there's analternative that's less restrictive than a rating requirement but still equallyeffective.  Mere SurfWatch/NetNanny, I suspect, has the potential to let a gooddeal of HTM material through. </P><P>Third, because the test under HTM is one of appeal to minors' prurient interest,the parade of horribles that could be lined up the law would be considerablyshorter and, to many, less horrible.  I recognize that the HTM standard mightstill cover a good deal of territory that should be protected, but in somerespects it covers a good deal less than the indecency standard. </P><P>Fourth, it turns out there is already an analogy to the CDA in realspace, thoughlimited to HTM material:  The laws in various states that bar the publicdisplay, where children may be present, of HTM matter.  A number of these lawshave been upheld by lower courts (both state and federal), in fairlywell-reasoned opinions.  And it does seem that these laws have a certain appealto many, even many 1st Am moderates.  I'm not sure the Court would be entirelyprepared to condemn these laws (though it might demand a ratings requirementrather than a total ban, since such a requirement would be a less restrictivealternative, and one that would be feasible online though not in realspace). </P><P>But in any event, no need to worry about that just yet:  For now, an importantpractical and symbolic victory. </P><P>(Finally, I should mention two things:  (1)  I agree with the court that the CDAdoes not actually embody the ratings alternative; we need to wait for a law thatmakes the whole system much more explicit.  (2)  I'm not at all sure that theratings model is a good policy idea, since I'm not persuaded that HTM materialis actually all that harmful to minors; I'm commenting only on theconstitutional question, based on the Court's past validation of the interest inshielding children from sufficiently sexually explicit material.) </P><P><HR></P><P>Appended by: Marshall Dyer -- Atty-Marshall K Dyer - Broken Arrow <BR> Date: Fri Jun 14 09:29:20 1996 <BR> Subject: The harder question </P><P>Eugene, </P><P>I'd like to get your thoughts on a couple of issues raised in discussion liststhat I follow. </P><P>First, what is the territorial application of the Preliminary Injunction?  Doesit reach beyond ED Pa, or is prosecution still only stalled by the self-imposedDOG moratorium outside the District. </P><P>Secondly, does the Supreme Court have discretion to deny the appeal, as with adenial of cert.

It'snot a practical issue, I don't think -- I cannot imagine that the DOJ wouldinitiate any prosecutions under this statute *anywhere* unless and until theycan get a reversal of this ruling.  But theoretically speaking, are theypermitted to do so in, say, Texas?  An analogy:  suppose the ED PA enjoinsMcDonalds from using some hiring practice that violates federal law.  WhileMcDonalds is appealing to the 3d Circuit, it comes to the ED PA court'sattention that the McDonalds in Texas is using the same hiring practice.  Isthat a violation of the injunction?  Since the ED PA has *personal* jurisdictionover McDonalds in PA, can it hold McDonalds in contempt?  [And a final question:is this, in fact, a good analogy for the injunction at issue here?] David </P><hr><p>Appended by: Robert Hamilton -- Jones Day - Columbus<br> Date: Fri Jun 14 15:14:35 1996<br> Subject: The harder question<p> There is no territorial limit on the power of the court to enjoin the conduct ofa defendant over whom the court has personal jurisdiction.  Ms. Reno might findherself in jail if the DOJ initiated yet another "investigation" of CompuServefor violating the enjoined provisions of the CDA, even though CompuServe isheadquartered outside the jurisdiction of  EDPA.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Eugene Volokh -- UCLA Law School - Los Angeles<br>Date: Fri Jun 14 17:17:11 1996<br> Subject: Rating requirement<p> I think the requirement would have to be of rating by posters, not by serviceproviders (at least unless the service provider itself selects what it posts,checking each proffered message before distributing it).<p> I recognize that this self-rating requirement would be a burden on speakers,because they'd have to decide whether their posting was HTM or not, a difficultmatter.  But such a burden is permissible, we are told, with regard to *bans* ondistribution of HTM material to minors.  Ginsberg v. New York.  I recognize thatthese bans are usually enforced only against commercial entities, but Ginsbergdoesn't seize on that as a distinction.  And the burden of a rating system mightin some ways be less than the burden of a ban, since an overcautious distributorwill just rate too much as "dirty," rather than deciding not to distribute it atall.  (Still a chilling effect, but not as severe a chilling effect.)<p> I agree that, one way or another -- either with regard to HTM rating systems orobscenity bans -- the "community standards" prong will have to vanish for anydisplay where the distributor can't tell the reader's geographical location.<p> I don't know the answer to the scope of injunction question.  I do believe thatthe Court must "decide" the appeal, though I think they have the discretion todecide summarily, without oral argument or written opinion.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Philip N.

She was then flush with the confidence of a lobbyistwhose wishes were about to be granted, and I was just some First Amendmentfanatic.  To her credit:  she's a very good spokesperson for her constituents,who nod and clap when she chants her "protect the children" mantra.  But itseemed to be like talking to the female-analog of "Big Brother" when I tried toexplain that the government is not and should not be in the business of tellingme what I am allowed to see, and that I can raise my  own children without herhelp, or the Justice Department's.  She is a very good role model for those whowould be censors, because she apparently is sincere in her belief that theentire Net should be made G-rated.  I hope that she continues to sputter afterthe Supreme Court gets done with this Act.<p> Jeremy Mishkin<p><hr><p>Appended by: Philip N. Argy -- Mallesons Stephen - Sydney<br> Date: Sun Jun 16 17:45:21 1996<br> Subject: Mrs. Cleaver?<p> Isn't that June, as in Beaver's mother?

Berkin -- Manatt Phelps - Los Angeles<br> Date: Sun Jun 16 19:40:44 1996<br> Subject: Trap For CDA Opponents<p> The constitutionality of the CDA should be divided into two aspects.  One iswhether regulation of non-obscene pornography on the Internet can beaccomplished in a manner that does not violate the First Amendment.  The secondaspect is the intrusion into non- pornographic speech, and this latter point isthe only aspect that was truly before the court.  It seems to me that it isimportant to try to get public debate focused on this distinction.  There is atrap that people like Cathy Cleaver and those manipulating her are trying toset, which is to frame the argument as one between those seeking to protectchildren and those who are indifferent to such protection.<p> I think that people like Cathy Cleaver are being manipulated by the proponentsof the CDA who, I believe, _intentionally_ made the law broad enough to threatenInternet communications _of all kinds_ about homosexuality and, to a lesserextent, abortion, sweeping in other issues of personal freedom along the way,because they would like to see those freedoms suppressed.  Ms. Cleaver seems tofeel that any law which protects children on the Internet is a good law, and sheseems closed to the possibility that there are either any other interests toprotect or any way to protect children's interests without trampling those otherinterests.  To the extent that her position is that she does not care about therights of others if they conflict with hers, then she converts the dialog on thesubject to competing monologues.<p> The trap is that the debate will consist of those competing monologues, with theresult (and, I believe, goal) that in an election year anyone who does notsupport the CDA is portrayed as anti-children.  For those of us concerned withprotection of First Amendment values, it is vital to try to get the public tounderstand that the only issue being litigated at present, in _any_ of thelawsuits over the CDA is the reach of the law to communications which are notthe ones the Cathy Cleavers claim to be trying to regulate.  In _ACLU_ thegovernment did not even seem to try to contend that non-target communications_could_ not be prosecuted, but only that they _would_ not be.  In other words,even the government acknowledged the potential that the law could be used toprosecute Internet discussions of abortion, homosexuality and safe sex and othertopics that are not chiefly pornography.  I would like to believe that thepublic at large can be made to understand this about the case.  It would be atragedy if many people in our country came to feel that freedom is incompatiblewith protection of children.<p> BTW, it would be interesting to see what the reaction from people like Ms.Cleaver would be if the criminal penalties were extended to _parents_ who failto use "effective means" to prevent their children from exposure to "indecent"or "patently offensive" material.  I would like to see whether in the face ofcriminal penalties they would themselves feel that it was clear enough what theycould and could not do, and would feel that they are secure from going to jailbecause of something done over which they have no control.<p> I also raise this because of my continuing disappointment with the notion thateverybody but the parents themselves is responsible for protecting children.  Insome ways, I see this as being like a bunch of parents bringing their childrento adult film theaters and then demanding that no x-rated films be shown becausethere are children present.<p>  <hr><p><hr><p>Appended by: Robert Hamilton -- Jones Day - Columbus<br> Date: Mon Jun 17 13:19:28 1996<br> Subject: Trap for CDA Opponents<p> Please tell us, Mr. Berkin, how you would distinguish between "non-obscenepornography" (which you seem to imply might be subject to permissibleregulation) and "non-pornographic speech" that is "indecent" or a "patentlyoffensive" depiction of sexual or excretory functions or organs?   How would youdefine "non-obscene pornography" and why do you think your definition would beany less vague or  problematic under the First Amendment?,p> What in the world makes you think that only "non-pornographic speech" was beforethe court in ACLU  v. Reno?  The plaintiffs only refrained from challenging therestrictions on obscenity and "child" pornography.<p> I'm not sure how you can say people like Cathy Cleaver are being manipulated bythe proponents of the CDA; Cleaver IS one of the key proponents and architectsof the CDA.  Your suggestion that these proponents wanted the law broad enoughto bar discussion of homosexuality and abortion is, I believe, way off the mark. None of the participants has ever suggested, as far as I have heard, that theCDA bars discussion of homosexuality or abortion.  Yes, there was an amendmentat the last minute that refers to a previously existing statutory ban on theimportation of materials discussing abortion, but everyone has always recognizedthat this previously existing statute was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The reason for the amendment was that this same statute also forbids theimportation of obscene material -- a clearly constitutional provision -- and theamendment made clear that importation of such material by use of the Internetand online services was covered by that statutory ban.  Congress' failure torepeal the clearly unconstitutional ban on importation of abortion materialwhile they were amending the statute to ban importation of obscene materialusing an interactive computer service was par for the course, and CDA opponentswere quick to label the CDA as being "intended" to bar discussion of abortion onthe Net, but those charges were essentially nothing but political hot air.<p> The CDA debate has suffered from an incredible lack of precision inargumentation, as well as obvious overstatement and sophistry on both sides. The essence of your criticism is correct, I think. But do you really mean toanalogize the entire online medium to an adult movie theater?<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Geoffrey A. Berkin -- Manatt Phelps - Los Angeles<br> Date: Tue Jun 18 03:43:50 1996<br> Subject: Trap<p> The distinction I made between non-obscene pornography and non-pornographicspeech was not intended to be a legal one, but rather one of sympathetic andpolitical appeal.  I do not favor regulation of non-obscene pornography on theInternet, but, as a parent, I am sympathetic to the problem that causes peopleto favor such regulation, especially for the purpose of protecting children. For purposes of discussion, and not for legal purposes, I would define"pornography" as sexual material the primary purpose of which is sexualstimulation.  Again for this discussion, I would describe "non-pornographicspeech" as speech which, under the CDA could be deemed to be indecent because itconcerns sexual or bodily functions, but which is primarily for the purpose ofeducation, public safety, cultural or artistic expression or some other functionwhere the main intended effect is not sexual stimulation. I do not propose thatthese forms are distinct as a legal matter for purposes of the First Amendment,and certainly do not suggest them as replacements for any terminology orconceptualization used by this, or any other, court.<p> The purpose of the distinction, and my comments overall, was to observe that formany people there seems to be no such distinction. For these people looking atthis law, the choice seems to be "will there be pornography, or will there notbe pornography, on the Internet?" without consideration of any speech other thanpornography which may be thwarted as a part of blocking pornography.  The trapto which I referred is that if the debate is allowed to be restricted to thosetwo choices, advocacy of the First Amendment may be seen as promotion ofpornography, and the First Amendment will seem useless or even harmful.  That,in my opinion, is an intended result of the CDA for some of its proponents.<p> That is also why I believe that people like Ms. Cleaver are being manipulated. Like Mr. Hamilton, I heard no one suggest that the CDA was intended to be usedto suppress discussion of homosexuality, abortion and similar topics, but I haveheard many politicians and others speak about those topics in othercircumstances using terms like "disgusting", "repugnant" and, yes, "indecent." I am also aware of instances in which material about homosexuality, etc., thatwas not graphic in nature was banned or sought to be banned from libraries orschools.  Do I have faith that no prosecutor in Salt Lake City or Memphis or inother parts of the U.S. would ever bring a prosecution against such non-graphicmaterial?  No, I do not, and that, in my humble opinion, is what this case isabout.  When purveyors of any material about controversial sexuality-relatedtopics face the risk of jail, or even of having to defend themselves incommunities far from their homes, it is hard for me to believe that there won'tbe some such purveyors who decide not to speak, rather than face the risk.<p> The silence of those people does not reduce the amount of pornography on theNet, but the fear of pornography is being used to create an environment that isextremely hostile to their expression, and thereby to try to silence them.  Forall the talk of protecting children, I believe - and I think that the ACLU courtbelieved - that the CDA goes far beyond protecting children.  The law could havebeen drafted in a narrower way that would have made the question ofconstitutionality a much closer one.  I think that the choice not to be narrowwas ultimately intentional, to take advantage of the appealing notion ofprotecting children to enact a statute that would chill many kinds ofcontroversial speech.<p> As to my contention that only non-pornographic speech was before the court, theruling states in several places that none of the plaintiffs was "quarrel[ing]with the statute to the extent that it covers obscenity or child pornography,"and that "none of the plaintiffs is a commercial purveyor of what is commonlytermed 'pornography.'"  The court did not have to decide whether the speech theCDA was ostensibly directed at could be regulated in the face of the FirstAmendment, since none of the plaintiffs were "speakers" of that "speech." Finally, the injunction stated that DOJ is prohibited from prosecuting, etc.,any matter under Sections 223(a)(1)(b) and 223(a)(2) to the extent that suchprosecution, etc., is "based upon allegations other than obscenity or childpornography."<p> </P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I><A HREF="comform.html">Submit yourquestion or comment to the discussion</i>.</a></p><P><I>To look up theemail address of the lawyers participating in this discussion, use ouronline directory of attorneys, <a href="http://www.counsel.com/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</a>. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P ALIGN=CENTER>  <IMG SRC="/spotlight/telecom/disclaim.gif" ALT="All Materials  Copyright 1996 Counsel Connect.

Gingrich's opposition to the CDA faded quickly when theChristian Right came into the game.<p> It is true, however, that lots of Democrats voted for the CDA.  In fact ,thekey votes  for securing passage came from Pat Schroeder and John Conyers.  Theyaccepted a transparently phony amendment during the conference.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: William Olmstead -- US Nuclear Reg. Com. - Washington<br> Date: Mon Jun 17 09:57:11 1996<br> Subject: Clinton Disagrees<p> Frankly, I don't think that name-calling advances either side of theargument. In my opinion, the reason you find Pat Schroeder, John Conyers, BillClinton,Newt Gingrich, and Bob Dole in seemingly contradictory positions on thisissuefrom time to time is because simplistic arguments make for simplistic lawbutnot good law.  I don't think "appeal to authority" arguments work either. Logical discourse on these issues require a recognition that the Internetpresents novel and complex issues merging many legal disciplines thatpreviouslywere thought to be quite distinct.  Telecommunications, publishing, patent,copyright, trade, mail fraud, conflicts, commercial code, place ofcontract, andother legal subjects are suddenly in juxtaposition.  If one cannot see thatthese conflicts require careful study, debate, and serious efforts toreconcilethem because of real and feared impacts on society, then one is setting thetable for Constitutional revision.  This is not a result that I would liketosee.  With particular reference to the CDA, while I agree that itoverreachesand attempts to solve the social problem it identifies with a meat axe,attention to the concerns it addresses is required.  Pornographic picturesdelivered to a child's Email address (in one example that I know of bymistake:the last two letters of the address were dropped thus sending the messageto thechild) cannot be acceptably defended by knee-jerk first amendmentarguments.  Further, this is not an issue solely for parents to resolve without supportandhelp from government.  At the very least, government needs to ensure thatparents have the appropriate tools to deal with these issues.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project - Washington<br> Date: Tue Jun 18 20:54:59 1996<br> Subject: That's not what happened<p> My complaint about Pat Schroeder and John Conyers was based on the factthatthey were duped.  This is inside baseball, but in conference, Rep.Goodlattepresented phony "compromise" language which Conyers and Schroedermisunderstood.<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project - Washington<br>Date: Tue Jun 18 21:03:25 1996<br> Subject: And you've got it wrong<p> On the merits, it is wrong to indicate that the CDA opponents favorindecent,obscene or  otherwise upsetting e-mail going to kids.<p>Our main point is that this is a judgment left to parents, not government,andthat developing technology will permit parental control.<p> We also argue that the CDA is ineffective.  For one thing, 40% of theInternetcontent originates outside the United States.  For another, the same peoplewhoare successfully designing parental filter software and tagging standards(PICS)make what seems to me (and to the Court) a persuasive showing that it isessentially impossible for online services and other carriers to monitorcontent.<p></P>Appended by: Mark Pruner -- Atty-M. Pruner - Riverside<br> Date: Fri Jun 21 16:26:35 1996<br> Subject: US Intl Jurisdiction<p> AP is reporting that US Dist. Judge Shira Scheindlin has ordered theItalian publisher of Playmen to shut down its "X rated Internet websitewithin two weeks or stop accepting new subscriptions from US customers". She also ordered Playmen to turn over to Playboy any profits from U.S.customers.  This all derived from a 1981 injunction banning Italian Playmenmagazine from the U.S.  The judge stated that, "Injunctions entered beforethe recent explosion of computer technology must continue to have meaning."and "Cyberspace is not a safe haven from which [the publisher] may floutthe court's injunction."

I don't know howDole voted on the bill.  I heard that he came out against the V-chip, butprobably only in a mutter.<p> It seems that supporting free speech is not a very popular politicalposition.

I've heard the suggestionthat this was modeled after the opinion in NY Times v. Sullivan -- a oneparagraph per curiam followed by each judge writing separately.  Each opinionseems to refer to each of the others in a manner suggesting that they divided upthe responsibility along particular substantive lines -- and with the exceptionof the vagueness claim (that 2 of the judges clearly accept, with one'dissenter'), the opinions don't strike me as being in conflict in anysignificant way.  Any thoughts on what's going on here?<p> David<p> <hr><p>Appended by: Robert Corn-Revere -- Hogan & Hartson - Washington<br> Date: Fri Jun 14 08:44:59 1996<br> Subject: Three Opinions, Indeed<p> I agree that the structure of the decision suggests a high degree ofcoordination between the judges.  Even where they disagree on the vaguenessissue, Judge Dalzell's position does not read like a dissent.  In fact, hestresses the invalidity of the CDA because it clearly applies to meritoriousspeech.  This would appear pose a dilemma to the government -- either the reachof the CDA is ambiguous (as Judges Sloviter and Buckwalter found) or it isprecise in that it applies to a broad range of protected speech.<p> The decision also is historic, because it is the first time a court has assessedthe First Amendment status of a new (and, to many, threatening) technology andfound it to be fully protected.  Indeed, if Judge Dalzell's conclusions areaccepted, we may see a rebirth of free speech that is unprecedented.<p> It is a great decision.<p><hr><p>Appended by: Robert Hamilton -- Jones Day - Columbus<br> Date: Fri Jun 14 15:17:51 1996<br> Subject: Three opinions<p> With all due respect, it is not the first time that a court has afforded fullFirst Amendment protection to the online medium.

I would still maintain that the ruling is bothhistoric and unique.<p>   <hr><p> <P ALIGN=CENTER><I><A HREF="comform.html">Submit yourquestion or comment to the discussion</i>.</a></p><P><I>To look up theemail address of the lawyers participating in this discussion, use ouronline directory of attorneys, <a href="http://www.counsel.com/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</a>. </BLOCKQUOTE> <P ALIGN=CENTER>  <IMG SRC="/spotlight/telecom/disclaim.gif" ALT="All Materials  Copyright 1996 Counsel Connect.

Subject: Good question, professor<p> 

I myself haven't heard any statements from Dole these past few days that weren't
in connection with the GOP abortion platform or his departure from the Senate.
However, I may have missed his comments on the CDA ruling.<p>   

It would surprise me, of course, if Dole expressed any sentiment that remotely
resembled approval of the decision.<p> 

(How about you?)<p>

Subject: He voted for the CDA<p> 

Senator Dole voted for the CDA, so I'd be surprised if he'd take what would be
perceived as a pro-porn position at this sensitive moment in his career.<p> 

On the other hand, he spoke rather harshly against the V-Chip when it was
considered in the Senate.  You can bet Clinton will remind American parents of
that fact.<p>

Subject: Dole-Grassley<p> 

I agree with Andy -- presidential campaigns are not often the forum in which
candidates renew their commitment to the First Amendment.  Senator Dole's
comments on the V-chip notwithstanding, it should be recalled that he
co-sponsored S.892 with Senator Grassley, a bill that in some respects was worse
than the Exon bill.  If anything, I would expect candidate Dole to stress this
fact during the campaign.<p>

<html><body bgcolor=ffffff><TITLE>Spotlight - Internaut v. Scientologists</TITLE><P>The following U.S. district court decision orders the Church ofScientology to return computer disks and documents it seized from a former churchmember who posted critical messages on the Internet. The court, however, enjoinedthe critic from posting substantial portions of church documents, finding he hadinfringed church copyrights by doing so. The court has yet to rule on churchclaims against the online service provider and the computer bulletin boardoperator Ehrlich used. <P><center><B>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT</B><P>FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA<P>RELIGIOUS TECHNOLOGY CENTER, a California non-profit corporation; and BRIDGEPUBLICATIONS, INC., a California non-profit corporation, <P><P>Plaintiffs,<P>v.<P>NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation; DENNISERLICH, an individual; and TOM KLEMESRUD, an individual, dba CLEARWOOD DATASERVICES, <P>Defendants.<P></center>No. C-95-20091 RMW<P>ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART PLAINTIFF'S APPLICATION FOR APRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND DEFENDANT ERLICH'S MOTION TO DISSOLVE THE TRO; DENYINGPLAINTIFFS' APPLICATION TO EXPAND THE TRO; DENYING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FORCONTEMPT; GRANTING ERLICH'S MOTION TO VACATE THE WRIT OF SEIZURE; AND DENYINGPLAINTIFFS' REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST ERLICH'S COUNSEL <P><P>This case involves the scope of intellectual property rights on theInternet.[FN1] Plaintiffs, two Scientology-affiliated organizations claimingcopyright and trade secret protection for the writings of the Church's founder,L. Ron Hubbard, brought this suit against defendant Dennis Erlich ("Erlich"), aformer Scientology minister turned vocal critic of the Church, who allegedly putplaintiffs' protected works onto the Internet.[FN2] <P>On June 23, 1995, this court heard the parties arguments on eight motions, fiveof which relate to Erlich and are discussed herein: (1) plaintiffs' motion for apreliminary injunction against Erlich and Erlich's related motion to dissolve oramend the Amended TRO; (2) plaintiffs' application to expand the TRO; (3)plaintiffs' motion for contempt against Erlich; (4) Erlich's motion to vacate thewrit of seizure; and (5) and plaintiffs' request for sanctions against Erlich'scounsel.[FN3] For the reasons set forth below, the court grants in part anddenies in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against Erlich andErlich's motion to dissolve the TRO, denies plaintiffs' application to expand theTRO, denies plaintiffs' motion for contempt against Erlich, grants Erlich'smotion to vacate the writ of seizure, and denies plaintiffs' request forsanctions against Erlich's counsel. <P><H3>I. BACKGROUND</H3>Defendant Dennis Erlich was a member of the Church of Scientology ("theChurch")[FN4] from approximately 1968 until 1982. During his years with theChurch, Erlich received training to enable him to provide ministerial counselingservices, known as "auditing." While with the Church, Erlich had access tovarious Scientology writings, including those of the Church's founder, L. RonHubbard ("Hubbard"), which the Church alleges include published literary works aswell as unpublished confidential materials (the "Advanced Technology works").According to plaintiffs, Erlich had agreed to maintain the confidentiality of theAdvanced Technology works. <P>Since leaving the Church, Erlich has been a vocal critic of Scientology and henow considers it part of his calling to foster critical debate about Scientologythrough humorous and critical writings. Erlich has expressed his views about theChurch by contributing the Internet "Usenet newsgroup" called"alt.religion.scientology" (the newsgroup")[FN5], which is an on-line forum forthe discussion of issues related to Scientology.[FN6] <P>Plaintiffs allege that in the six months prior to their filing suit, Erlichunlawfully posted to the newsgroup works from two separate categories of writingsby Hubbard which are contained in Exhibits A and B of the FAC. FollowingHubbard's death in 1986, ownership of Hubbard's copyrights passed to Author'sFamily Trust-B. In 1993, the copyrights were distributed to the Church ofSpiritual Technology ("CST"), a California nonprofit religious corporation.Plaintiff Bridge Publications, Inc. ("BPI"), a nonprofit branch of the Church,claims to be the exclusive licensee of CST's copyrighted literary works listed inExhibit A to the Complaint ("Exhibit A works"), which consist mainly of policyletters and bulletins from the Church. <P>Plaintiff Religious Technology Center ("RTC"), a nonprofit religiouscorporation, "was formed by Scientologists, with the approval of [Hubbard], toact as the protector of the religion of Scientology and to own, protect, andcontrol the utilization of the Advanced Technology[FN7] in the United States."FAC, Ex. C, at 2. RTC claims to be the exclusive licensee of the copyrights andthe owner of the other rights in the unpublished Advanced Technology works listedin Exhibit B to the Complaint (the "Advanced Technology" works or the "Exhibit Bworks"). <P>BPI and RTC allege that Erlich infringed the copyrights in the Exhibit A and Bworks. RTC also alleges that Erlich misappropriated its trade secrets in theExhibit B works, the confidentiality of which it alleges has been the subject toelaborate security measures. RTC further claims that those works are extremelyvaluable to the Church. Erlich admits to having posted excerpts from some of theworks, but argues that the quotations were used to provide context for debate andas a basis for his criticism. Erlich further argues that he has neither claimedauthorship of any of the works nor personally profited from his critique, satire,and commentary. Erlich contends that all of the Exhibit B documents he posted hadbeen previously posted anonymously over the Internet, except for item 1, which heclaims he received anonymously through the mail. <P>From August to December 1994, plaintiffs exchanged a series of letters withErlich, warning him to stop posting their protected writings onto the newsgroup.Plaintiffs also demanded that defendants Netcom and Klemesrud take actions toprevent Erlich's continued postings of protected materials. Erlich indicated thathe would not stop, claiming he had a right to continue with his criticism andsatire. On February 8, 1995, plaintiffs filed this action against Erlich,Klemesrud, and Netcom for copyright infringement and, against Erlich alone, formisappropriation of trade secrets, seeking actual, statutory, and punitivedamages, injunctive relief, impoundment of the infringing materials andequipment, and attorneys' fees and costs. <P>On February 10, 1995, the court granted plaintiffs' ex parte application for atemporary restraining order ("TRO") prohibiting Erlich from making unauthorizeduse of works identified in the exhibits to the complaint and an order directingthe clerk to issue a writ of seizure under 17 U.S.C. section 503(a). On February13, 1995, in execution of the writ of seizure, local police officers enteredErlich's home to conduct the seizure. The officers were accompanied by severalRTC representatives, who aided in the search and seizure of documents related toErlich's alleged copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets.Erlich alleges that RTC officials in fact directed the seizure, which tookapproximately seven hours. Erlich alleges that plaintiffs seized books, workingpapers, and personal papers. After locating Erlich's computers, plaintiffsallegedly seized computer disks and copied portions of Erlich's hard disk driveonto floppy disks and then erased the originals from the hard drive. Althoughplaintiffs returned to Erlich's counsel some of the articles seized, Erlichcontends that plaintiffs have not returned all of the seized articles, includingones that are unrelated to the litigation. <P>On February 23, 1995, the court issued an "Amended TRO," which sought to clarifywhat types of use were prohibited and to emphasize that Erlich could make "fairuse" of the Exhibit A works. <P><H3>II. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION/DISSOLUTION OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER[FN8]</H3><B>A. Legal Standards</B><P>A party seeking a preliminary injunction may establish its entitlement toequitable relief by showing either (1) a combination of probable success on themerits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) serious questions as tothese matters and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. First<I>Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc.,</I> 809 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1987). These twotests are not separate, but represent a continuum of equitable discretion wherebythe greater the relative hardship to the moving party, the less probability ofsuccess need be shown. <I>Regents of University of California v. AmericanBroadcasting Cos.,</I> 747 F.2d 511, 515 (9th Cir. 1984). The primary purpose of apreliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial on themerits. <I>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League,</I> 634F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980). <P><B>B. Likelihood of Success on Copyright Infringement Claims</B> <P>To establish copyright infringement, plaintiffs must demonstrate (1) they own avalid copyright and (2) Erlich violated any of their exclusive rights, including,inter alia, the rights to reproduce or prepare derivative works from theoriginal, or to distribute or display copies publicly. 17 U.S.C. sections106(1)-(3) & (5), 501(a); Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone ServiceCo., 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1296 (1991). Erlich, for the most part, admits to having"copied" the Exhibit A and B works, but contends that plaintiffs are not able toestablish ownership of a valid copyright interest in those works. Erlich alsoargues that his activities do not constitute infringement because his use was a"fair use." <P>1. Ownership of a Valid Copyright<P>Proof of ownership of an existing, valid, and registered copyright interest is astatutory prerequisite to filing an infringement action. 17 U.S.C. section 411.Registration, when "made before or within five years after first publication ofthe work[,] shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of thecopyright," including originality, compliance with statutory formalities, andcopyrightability. Id. section 410(c); 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmeron Copyright (1995) ("Nimmer") section 12.11[B]. When registration is made morethan five years after first publication, the evidentiary weight of thecertificate of registration is within the court's discretion. Id. section12.11[A],[B]. Where the plaintiff is not the author of a work, he must provideevidence of a chain of title from the registrant to him. Nimmer section 12.11[C].<P>Plaintiffs provide evidence of registration for all of the Exhibit A and Bworks. See FAC, Ex. H. Plaintiffs further provide copies of assignment andlicensing agreements purportedly showing the necessary chain of title fromHubbard, the author of the works, to plaintiffs RTC and BPI. Attached to the FACare assignments of all rights in the Advanced Technology works from Hubbard andhis estate to RTC. Id., Exs. C, D, F & G. Under the "Literary Agreement" attachedto the FAC, BPI is the exclusive licensee of various published, non-fictionHubbard works, including those works in Exhibit A to the FAC. Id., Ex. E. <P>Erlich sets forth in his "Appendix re: Copyright Issues" a host of purportedirregularities and defects with the registrations, maintaining that plaintiffshave failed to prove a likelihood of success on ownership of many, if not all, ofthe works. The court find that, except as to item 4 of Exhibit A, Erlich hasfailed to rebut the presumption of validity. <P>Erlich's contention that item 4 of Exhibit A ("20 Nov 1961, Routine 3DCommands") has fallen into the public domain appears to be correct. Theregistration for item 4 gives a first publication date of 1961. Under theCopyright Act of 1909 ("the 1909 Act"), which still applies to works that werefirst published prior to January 1, 1964, an author is entitled to an initial28-year copyright term, which expires unless the copyright is renewed by theauthor or his statutory successors during the final year of the initial term. 2Nimmer section 9.05[B][1]. The copyright notice date on item 4 is evidence thatthe work was first prohibited in 1961. See <I>New Era Publications International,ApS v. Carol Publishing Group,</I> 729 F. Supp. 992, 995 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd in part,rev'd in part, 904 F.2d 152 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 921 (1990). Becausethere is no evidence that the copyright for item 4 was renewed in 1989. 28 yearsafter its initial publication, the court finds that it fell into the publicdomain and cannot be the subject of an action for infringement. See id.Plaintiffs argue, however, that item 2 was part of a collection that wasregistered in 1976, the year that it was first published. As such, plaintiffscontend that the collective work is not yet subject to renewal. While those partsof the 1976 collection that were first published in 1976 were not subject torenewal in 1989, those previously published portions of the collection, such asitem 4, must still be timely renewed notwithstanding the registration as acollection in 1976. See 1 Nimmer sections 3.07[C], 3.04[A], at 3-19. <P>Erlich's next claim is that plaintiffs have not registered the works that wereinfringed, but only the compilations in which they were included. Where, as here,the author of a collection or derivative work is also the author of thepreexisting work, registration of the collection is sufficient. <I>Abend v. MCA,Inc.,</I> 863 F.2d 1465, 1471-72 (9th Cir. 1988), aff'd, 495 U.S. 207 (1990); 2Nimmer section 7.16[B][2], at 7-168 to -170 (distinguishing this situation fromthat where copyright owner of collective work is not also the owner of thepreexisting work). Here, Hubbard was the author of the underlying work and wasalso the author of the collection of his own works. Accordingly, registration ofthe collections that include the Exhibit A works constitutes registration of theunderlying works. <P>Erlich's next argument, that plaintiffs have not shown that Hubbard's statutorysuccessors assigned the renewal terms of the copyrights to plaintiffs, is clearlyrebutted by the evidence. See Hawkins Decl., Exs. A-1. The Exhibit B works do notrequire renewal because they were unpublished as of January 1, 1978, theeffective date of the Copyright Act of 1976 ("the 1976 Act"), and were thusprotected only by common law copyright. See 2 Nimmer section 9.01[B][2], at 9-17to -18. As of January 1, 1978, these works became protected by statutorycopyright under the new scheme of the 1976 Act, which does not require renewal.Id. <P>Finally, Erlich contends that the automatic statutory presumption of validitydoes not apply because many of the works were published more than five yearsbefore registration. The dates specified in a copyright notice are evidence ofthe date of publication. New Era, 729 F. Supp. at 995. As to the unpublished[FN9]Exhibit B works, registrations were made before first publication in accordancewith section 410(c) and thus the presumption is still valid. However, it appearsErlich is correct that the statutory presumption does not apply as to items 1, 2,4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Exhibit A. It is within the court's discretion what weightto give the copyright registrations in determining the validity of the copyrightinterests of those works for which plaintiffs are not entitled to an automaticpresumption of validity. In light of plaintiffs' evidence of validity, seeHawkins Decl., and the lack of a persuasive challenge to the validity of thecopyrights by Erlich, the court finds that plaintiffs' registrations are strongevidence of the validity of their claimed copyrights.[FN10] <P>2. Direct Infringement<P>Except as to item 9 of Exhibit A and item 9 of Exhibit B, see Oakley May 12,1995 Decl., Ex. B, Erlich does not dispute that he engaged in "copying," whichwould constitute direct infringement under section 106. As to the item 9 works,there is no evidence that Erlich ever made any postings of or otherwise copiedthose items. The court will therefore consider plaintiffs' infringement claims asto the remaining works.[FN11] <P>3. Fair Use Defense<P>"Infringement" consists of violating the author's exclusive rights. 17 U.S.C.section 501. Although the author has the exclusive rights to reproduce,distribute, and display a copyrighted work under section 106, these rights arelimited by the defense[FN12] of "fair use". <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 and 106A, the fair use of acopyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies. . . or by anyother means specified in that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment,news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. <P>17 U.S.C. section 107 (emphasis added). The defense "permits and requires courtsto avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it wouldstifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster." <I>Campbell v.Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,</I> 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1170 (1994) (citation omitted). Congresshas set out four nonexclusive factors to be considered in determining theavailability of the fair use defense: <P><OL><LI> the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of acommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; <P><LI> the name of the copyrighted work;<P><LI> the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to thecopyrighted work as a whole; and <P><LI> the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of thecopyrighted work. <P></ol>17 U.S.C. section 107. The fair use doctrine calls for a case-by-case analysis.Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1170. All of the factors "are to be explored, and theresults weighed together, in light of the purposes of the copyright." Id. at1170-71. <P>a. First Factor: Purpose and Character of the Use <P>The first statutory factor looks to the purpose and character of the defendants'use. Erlich argues that his use was criticism, which is one of those uses listedin the preamble to section 107. Similarly, Erlich maintains that his use wasmeant to "evoke discussion regarding various Scientology philosophies." Mot. ToDissolve at 22. Use for the purpose of criticism weighs in favor of fair use. SeeNew Era, 904 F.2d at 156-57 (using Hubbard's works in critical biography meetsfirst factor for fair use). Plaintiffs contest Erlich's characterizations of hisuse, claiming that most of Erlich's postings were verbatim copies, with little orno added comment or criticism.[FN13] Plaintiffs further contend that Erlich'spurpose was spite or some other destructive reason. However, plaintiffs give noexplanation as to why Erlich's purpose was other than to criticize or to evokediscussion regarding Scientology. Because there is insufficient evidence tosupport plaintiffs' claim that Erlich's copying was made out of spite or forother destructive reasons, the court will assume Erlich's intended purpose wascriticism or comment. <P>Transformative Use<P>Plaintiffs' argument that the amount of added criticism belies Erlich's criticalpurpose can also be construed as an attack on the "transformative" nature ofErlich's use. In Campbell, the Supreme Court held that the central purpose of thefirst inquiry is to determine whether the new work is transformative (alsodescribed as "productive"), that is, whether it "adds something new, with afurther purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression,meaning, or message." 114 S.ct. at 1171. Erlich's use is only minimallytransformative since, unlike the typical critic, Erlich adds little newexpression to the Church's works. Accordingly, despite Erlich's purportedcritical purpose, the actual character of his use does not weigh heavily in hisfavor because it has only a slight transformative nature. In any case, theSupreme Court held in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464U.S. 417, 455 n.40 (1984) that the fair use defense is not "rigidlycircumscribed" by the productive use requirement. The Court found that a homeviewer's verbatim copying of copyrighted television shows for the purposes oftime shifting was fair use even though there was only a minimal showing ofincreased convenience to the home user. <P>Commercial Nature of Use<P>Where the use is not highly transformative, as here, the court will focus onwhether the use is of a commercial nature. The Campbell Court emphasized that acommercial use does not dictate against a finding of fair use, as most of theuses listed in the statute are "generally conducted for profit in this country."114 S.Ct. at 1174. Nonetheless, the Court recognized that a commercial use weighsagainst a finding of fair use. Id. The fact that there is no evidence that Erlichgains financially from his criticism of the Church weighs in his favor. <P>Plaintiffs argue, however, that Erlich personally gains through increased statusand recognition among his peers and the public. In <I>Weissmann v. Freeman,</I> 868 F.2d1313 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 883 (1989), the Second Circuit recognizedthat, in the unusual setting of academia, a defendant can profit personally fromcopying despite the lack of a monetary gain. The defendant in Weissman was aprofessor who copied a former assistant's scholarly work, used it for the samepurpose as the author, and claimed credit for himself, thereby aiding hisprofessional advancement. Id. at 1324. Here, there is neither evidence thatErlich took credit for any of plaintiffs' works nor that he is personallyprofiting, professionally or otherwise, as a result of his postings. If mererecognition by one's peers constituted "personal profit" to defeat a finding of anoncommercial use, courts would seldom find any criticism fair use and muchvaluable criticism would be discouraged. Thus, the court finds that Weissman isinapplicable here, and that its holding should not be stretched to swallow allnonprofit criticism motivatedby concern for status. Accordingly, based on theclearly noncommercial nature of the use and the protected purpose of criticism,the court finds that the first fair use factor weighs slightly in Erlich's favordespite the minimally transformative nature of Erlich's use. <P>Defendant's Conduct<P>Plaintiffs contend that, regardless of the results of weighing the four fair usefactors, a finding of fair use is nonetheless precluded because Erlich's copieswere made not from legitimate copies of the works but from unauthorized copies.Although plaintiffs discuss this purported "good faith" prerequisite[FN14] tofair use apart from the four factors, it is properly a factor to be consideredwith the first statutory factor regarding the character of the use. 3 Nimmersection 13.05[A][1][d], at 13-171 to -174 (discussing "defendant conduct" as oneaspect of the first statutory factor). <P>The court finds that plaintiffs' showing on bad faith is mixed at best. There isno evidence here that Erlich obtained his copies of plaintiffs' works throughdeceit. Cf. Atari, 975 F.2d at 836, 843 (finding no fair use where defendantobtained plaintiff's source code by lying to copyright office). Unlike Sega,there is no admission by the defendant that he does not possess any legal copies.As to several of the Exhibit A works, it appears that Erlich possessedlegitimate, published books containing some of the works, plaintiffs offer noevidence that Erlich obtained these books in some unlawful or illegitimatemanner.[FN15] However, as to those works where Erlich claims he obtained hiscopies over the Internet or anonymously through the mail, this does not negate aninference that he received those copies in an improper manner. Erlich's copies ofExhibit B works were more likely unauthorized than not; plaintiffs have providedsubstantial evidence that the Advanced Technology works are kept confidential,see infra part II, C.2, and that Erlich would not have been given permission tokeep a copy of those works. For most of the disputed works, the fact that Erlichmay have obtained his copies in an unauthorized manner tends to weigh inplaintiffs' favor. This finding, however, will not bar Erlich's fair use defense,but will merely be considered with the other factors. <P>b. Second Factor: Nature of the Copyrighted Work <P>The second factor focuses on two different aspects of the copyright work:whether it is published or unpublished and whether it is informational orcreative. <P>Published vs. Unpublished<P>The unpublished status of a work is "a critical element of its 'nature."' Harper& Row, 471 U.S. at 564 (finding no fair use where <I>The Nation</I> magazine usedunpublished manuscript to scoop <I>Time</I> magazine). <I>The Nation</I> case held that "thescope of fair use is narrower with respect to unpublished works." Id. In a caseinvolving copying of allegedly unpublished works by Hubbard, the Second Circuitrecognized that where the works were unpublished no court had yet found in favorof the infringer on the second factor. New Era, 904 F.2d at 155. Nevertheless,the Second Circuit affirmed a finding of fair use where a biographer quotedportions of unpublished letters. Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731 (2dCir. 1991); see also <I>Norse v. Henry Holt & Co.,</I> 847 F. Supp. 142, 147 (N.D.Cal.1994) (finding fair use where 50 words copied from unpublished letters and allbut the second factor weighed in favor if defendant). In 1992, Congress amendedsection 107 of the 1976 Act to clarify that the unpublished nature of a workshould not itself bar a finding of fair use. See H.R. Rep. No. 102-286, 102dCong., 2d Sess. 8 (1992) (House Report) (citing Wright with approval andcriticizing earlier Second Circuit decisions that created a per se rule againstfair use of unpublished works); see also 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][2], at 13-184to -186. Congress construed the Nation's statement that the scope of fair use isnarrower for unpublished works to mean that the amount of permissible copyingwill be less in the case of an unpublished work. Id. <P>Even though a work is read by a large group of people, it is still unpublishedwhere it is held confidential and the authors do not relinquish control overtheir copies of the work. See College <I>Entrance Examination Board v. Cuomo,</I> 788F.Supp. 134-41 (N.D.N.Y. 1992) (finding that administered secure tests werenecessarily unpublished because author did not relinquish control and finding forauthor on second fair use factor). Plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated thatthe Exhibit B Advanced Technology works are kept confidential using tightsecurity measures. See infra part II.C.3. Although there is evidence thatindividuals may have made unauthorized public disclosures of some of these works,see id., the works are still "unpublished" for the purposes of the fair usedefense. See discussion supra note 9. However, the Exhibit A works, with oneexception, are published. Accordingly, this portion of the second factor weighsin Erlich's favor as to the published Exhibit A works and strongly in plaintiffs'favor as to the Exhibit B works. <P>Informational vs. Creative<P>The second aspect of this factor looks to broaden the protection of those worksthat are creative, fictional, or highly original and lessen the protection forthose works that are factual, informational, or functional. See Campbell, 114S.Ct. at 1175. The Second Circuit noted the obvious difficulty in applying thistest in a case involving a large number of works by Hubbard: <P>We agree. . . that there is no easy distinction between works that are "factual"on the one hand, and "creative" or "expressive" on the other, because"'[c]reation of a nonfiction work, even a compilation of pure fact, entailsoriginality."' Thus, reasonable people can disagree over how to classifyHubbard's works. <P>New Era, 904 F.2d at 158 (citations omitted). The Second Circuit concluded that"although some of the quoted passages can accurately be described as expressive -e.g., Hubbard's poetry - our review of the record persuades us that most simplycannot be so characterized." A district judge in this Circuit, considering worksthat are part of the Church's Advanced Technology, concluded that "Hubbard'sworks are the product of his creative thought process, and not merelyinformational."[FN16] <I>Bridge Publications, Inc. v. Vien,</I> 827 F.Supp. 629, 635-36(S.D. Cal. 1993). <P>In the present case, this court also finds the task of categorizing Hubbard'swritings difficult. In their complaint, plaintiffs describe Hubbard as the authorof "original works on applied religious philosophy and spiritual healingtechnology, including training materials and course manuals of the Scientologyreligion." FAC 9. In reviewing the Exhibit A works, which are predominantly"policy letters" of the Hubbard Communications Office, the court finds that theseworks, although creative, are primarily functional or instructive. Item 1 ofExhibit B, the Class VIII "Assists" Tape, appears more original and creative thanthe other works, and is thus deserving of greater fair use protection. Theremaining Exhibit B works, however, are part of the methodology of the Church's"applied religious philosophy," and as such are more instructive and functionalthan fictional. This court is not convinced, however, that this factor shouldplay a major role in the context of religious works, which do not easily fit intothe creative/informational dichotomy. <P>Because the Exhibit B works are unpublished and large portions of them werecopied by Erlich, see infra part II.B.3.c, this factor weighs heavily againstErlich with respect to those works, despite the informational nature of most ofthem. The Exhibit A works, however, are published and primarily informational,and this factor weighs in favor of Erlich as to those works. <P>c. Third Factor: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used <P>The third factor concerns both the percentage of the original work that wascopied, and whether that portion constitutes the "heart" of the copyrighted work.Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65. The copying of an entire work will ordinarilymilitate against a finding of fair use, although this is not a per se rule. Sony,464 U.S. at 449-50 (finding exception to this rule for time-shifting by homeviewers to enable them to see works that they were invited to see in theirentirety free of charge). The amount of copying that is acceptable will depend onthe character of the use and degree to which the copy transforms the original.Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1175-76 (finding parody can copy enough of original to"conjure [it] up" so the audience will recognize what is being parodied). Lesscopying will be acceptable where the original is unpublished. See 3 Nimmersection 13.05[A][2], at 13-185 n.200. <P>Plaintiffs allege that Erlich's posting copy substantial amounts of theoriginals or, in some cases, the entire works. Erlich responds that, as to someof the copied works, the original documents are actually only a small part of alarger collection. See Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. C. Erlich claims that the courtshould look at the entire registered collective work to determine the percentageof that work which Erlich copied. However, the Ninth Circuit held in <I>HustlerMagazine, Inc. v. Moral Majority, Inc.,</I> 796 F.2d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir. 1986) that"[a] creative work does not deserve less protection just because it is part ofcomposite work." The Second Circuit held in <I>American Geophysical Union v. Texaco,Inc.,</I> 802 F. Supp. 1, 17 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 37 F.3d 881 (2d Cir. 1994) thatcopying an entire article from a journal whose copyright has been registered as awhole still constitutes copying the entire work. Similarly, here, although manyof Hubbard's lectures, policy statements, and course packets are collected intolarger volumes, and registered as a whole, they may still constitute separateworks for the purposes of this factor. <P>It appears Erlich copied all or almost all of many of the works,[FN17] whichwere predominantly short documents of less than three pages, and mostly with nocomments or with very brief comments[FN18] at the beginning or end. See McShaneFebruary 27, 1995 Decl., Ex. A, B, C-1. The court further finds that where Erlichonly copied a portion of a work, that portion constituted the "heart: of thework. Compare February 27, 1995 App. in Support of Warren McShane, Exs. 1A-188Awith 1B-188B; see Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65 (finding a quotation of 300out of 200,000 words that were "essentially the heart of the book" not fair use).Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in plaintiffs' favor, especially as tothe unpublished works, where the amount of acceptable copying is even lower. <P>d. Fourth factor: Effect of the Use upon the Potential Market for the Work <P>The fourth and final statutory factor concerns "the extent of market harm causedby the particular actions of the alleged infringer" and "whether unrestricted andwidespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . . would result ina substantially adverse impact on the potential market' for the original."Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1177 (quoting 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][4]) (remanding forconsideration of this factor). Although the results of all four factors must beweighed together, id. at 1171, the fourth factor is central to the fair useanalysis, 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][4], at 13-188 to -189 (citing Harper & Row,471 U.S. at 566), 13-207 (observing that fourth factor explains results in recentSupreme Court cases). <P>Plaintiffs contend that Erlich's posting of plaintiffs' copyrighted works overthe Internet, where more than 25 million subscribers could access them, couldpotentially have a detrimental effect on plaintiffs. Plaintiffs point to the factthat, in the past, the Church has faced "ex-parishioners using copyrightedmaterials to set up and market 'religious' training adapted from the Scientologyreligion." Pltfs.' Opp'n at 39. In Vien, the defendant had left the Church ofScientology to start her own competing ministry, taking with her some of theChurch's Advanced Technology works, which she used in her courses and offered forsale. 827 F.Supp. at 632-34. The court held that "since defendant uses the worksfor the same purpose intended by plaintiffs, it appears defendant's unauthorizedcopies fulfill the 'demand for the original' works and 'diminish or prejudice'their potential sale." Id. at 636. <P>Plaintiffs' case is not as strong here as it was in Vien. The demand of thoseseeking out the Church's religious training till hardly be met by Erlich'spostings.[FN19] Even if Erlich's copying of plaintiffs' works were not for acritical purpose, plaintiffs would still have not shown that Erlich's postingdiminish the demand by Church followers in the courses. According to the Church,these courses must be studied in a systematic fashion, following one "course" ata time, with proper guidance. McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 7-8; see Wollersheim,796 F.2d at 1091 (noting RTC's argument that Advanced Technology works are tradesecrets whose misappropriation would cause "'religious harm' . . . [to] adherentsfrom premature unsupervised exposure to the materials"). Although many ofErlich's postings contain much of an original work, each of these works is only asmall portion of the teachings necessary for a particular "course." See OakleyReply Decl., Ex. C. For the most part, Erlich's postings are sporadic andincomplete. The court is thus not convinced that postings like Erlich's could beeffectively used by rival Scientology-like religious groups. Moreover, there isno evidence that the Church currently faces any competition by ex-parishioners,see Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. B., McShane Depo. at 95, although there iscircumstantial evidence that such competition could occur in the future, based onthe fact that several groups have competed with the Church in the past. See id.at 93-94. <P>There is little evidence of a systematic attempt by Erlich at posting thecomplete works necessary for setting up a competing religious group. It seemsunlikely, although possible, that Erlich's postings, if continued and expanded,could supply such a group with the means to compete with plaintiffs. Seediscussion infra part II.B.3. While the demand for a particular work may besuppressed through criticism, it is unlikely that the demand for the Church'sunique ability to provide parishioners with a complete and guided access to thevarious course materials will be suppressed. The court finds it unlikely thatErlich's noncommercial use, or widespread conduct like Erlich's use by others,would diminish or prejudice the potential sale of plaintiffs' works, interferewith their marketability, or fulfill the demand for the works. See <I>Maxtone-Grahamv. Burtchaell,</I> 803 F.2d 1253, 1264 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1059(1987) (finding no market harm where pro-choice work was excerpted inanti-abortion book because of differing viewpoints and editorial formats);Hustler, 796 F.2d at 1155-56; <I>Religious Technology Center v. Lerma,</I> _ F. Supp. _,No. 95-1107-A, slip op. at 10 (E.D. Va. August 30, 1995) (finding fair usedefense probably valid in part because no separate market for Advanced Technologyworks where Scientologists cannot effectively use them without the Church'ssupervision); <I>Religious Technology Center v. F.A.C.T. Net. Inc.,</I> No. 95-B-2143,slip op. at 11-14 (D. Colo. September 15, 1995) (finding valid fair use defensebecause financial harm to the Church was unlikely and there was no showing of apotential effect on the market for plaintiffs' works). Accordingly, the courtfinds that this factor weighs in Erlich's favor. <P>e. Equitable Balancing<P>In balancing the various factors, the court finds that the percentage ofplaintiffs' works copied combined with the minimal added criticism or commentarynegates a finding of fair use. Although criticism is a favored use, where that"criticism" consists of copying large portions of plaintiffs' works - andsometimes all of those works - with often no more than one line of criticism, thefair use defense is inappropriate. Erlich has not adequately justified hiscopying verbatim large portions of plaintiffs' works. The amount of copying wasparticularly unacceptable with the unpublished Exhibit B works. <P>While copying all or most of a work does not necessarily preclude fair use,those cases recognizing fair use for complete copying are easily distinguishable.Although the Sony Court found acceptable the copying of entire television showswith no added content, this was necessary for the purpose of time-shifting.Unlike Erlich, the time-shifters in Sony were already given permission to viewthe works in their entirety for free. Sony, 464 U.S. at 449-450. The Courtfurther noted in Sony that time-shifters are just as likely to buy prerecordedvideos as live viewers, and thus there is no effect on the market for theoriginal. Id. at 450 n. 33. The case that perhaps best supports Erlich'sposition, Belmore, is also distinguishable. See supra note 17. The original workcopied verbatim in Belmore was shorter than many of the works Erlich copied andthe added criticism in Belmore was far longer than most of the criticism thatErlich made. 880 F. Supp. at 678-79. Additionally, unlike the district court inBelmore, this court does not find reasonable Erlich's claim that he copied nomore than was necessary for his purpose. Moreover, this court is not convincedthat Belmore is supported by Ninth Circuit law. See <I>Supermarket of Homes, Inc. v.San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors,</I> 786 F.2d 1400, 1409 (9th Cir. 1986)("Generally, no more of a work may be taken than is necessary to make theaccompanying comment understandable."). <P>While use of a large percentage or the "heart" of the copyrighted work does notrule out fair use per se, other factors are not sufficiently in Erlich's favor toovercome this third factor. Further, the second factor weighs strongly againstErlich as to the unpublished works. The almost verbatim copying here shows thatErlich's work is only minimally transformative and that it is unlikely thatErlich is "truly pursuing a different functional milieu" from the original. 3Nimmer section 13.05[D][1], at 13-231. In addition, as to the unpublishedmaterials, Erlich's use of possibly illicit copies of those works weighs againsthim. Thus, Erlich's showing on the first factor is not very strong despite hiscritical purpose. Similarly, Erlich's showing on the fourth factor does notpersuasively suggest fair use. If Erlich's use were to become widespread, itcould potentially have an effect on the market for plaintiffs' works by supplyingfuture splinter groups with the materials needed to compete with the Church. Thecourt views this potentiality as somewhat remote. Nevertheless, given plaintiffs'very strong showing on the third factor, the court finds that, on balance, theequities do not favor a finding of fair use. The case against fair use is evenmore compelling for the unpublished works.[FN20] But see Lerma, slip op. at 10(order denying temporary restraining order against defendant Washington Post fromusing Advanced Technology documents obtained from open court files in Fishman;finding fair use defense exists where no separate market for works becauseScientologist cannot effectively use them without the Church's supervision);F.A.C.T. Net, slip op. at 11-14 (denying preliminary injunction against copyingof Advanced Technology works based on fair use defense because financial harm tothe Church was unlikely, there was no commercial motive, works were used in partof "ongoing dialogue" on the Internet, and there was no showing of a potentialeffect on the market for plaintiffs' works). <P>4. Conclusion<P>Accordingly, plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on its claimsthat Erlich infringed their copyrights on all of the Exhibit A and B works,except items 4 and 9 of Exhibit A and item 9 of Exhibit B. <P><B>C. Likelihood of Success on Trade Secret Claim </B><P>In third cause of action, plaintiff RTC alleges that Erlich misappropriated itstrade secrets. California has adopted a version of the Uniform Trade Secret Act("UTSA"), Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1 et seq. The UTSA defines a trade secretas <P>information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method,technique, or process, that: <P><OL><LI> Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not beinggenerally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic valuefrom its disclosure or use; and <P><LI> Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances tomaintain its secrecy. <P></ol>Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1(d).[FN21] The UTSA further defines"misappropriation" of a trade secret as <P><OL><LI> Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reasonto know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or <P><LI> Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or impliedconsent by a person who: <P><UL><LI> Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or <P><LI> At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his or herknowledge of the trade secret was; <P><oL><LI> Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquireit; <P><LI> Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecyor limit its use; or <P><LI> Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seekingrelief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or <P></ol><LI> Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to knowthat it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accidentor mistake. <P></ul>Id. at 3426.1(b). </OL><P>To establish its trade secret claim, RTC must show, inter alia, that theAdvanced Technology works (1) have independent economic value to competitors and(2) have been kept confidential. <P>1. Nature of Works<P>As a preliminary matter, Erlich argues that the Advanced Technology works cannotbe trade secrets because of their nature as religious scriptures. In Wollersheim,796 F.2d at 1090-91, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Church's application for apreliminary injunction on the basis of a trade secret claim against a splinterScientology group that had acquired stolen copies of the Advanced Technology. TheChurch argued not that the works gave them a competitive market advantage butthat disclosure of the works would cause its adherents "religious harm . . . frompremature unsupervised exposure to the materials." Id. Although the Ninth Circuitrejected plaintiffs' trade secret argument based on the spiritual value of theharm, it later noted that it had left open the question of whether the AdvancedTechnology works could qualify as trade secrets, assuming plaintiffs could provethat the secrets confer on them an actual economic advantage over competitors.<I>Religious Technology Center v. Scott,</I> 869 F.2d 1306, 1310 (9th Cir. 1989); cf.Vien, 729 F. Supp. at 629.[FN22] Nonetheless, the court noted that such anallegation would "raise grave doubts about [the Church's] claims as a religionand a not-for-profit corporation."(23) Id. (quoting Wollersheim 796 F.2d at1091). <P>The Church contends that the Advanced Technology works consist of "processes andthe theory behind those processes . . . that are to be used precisely as setforth by L. Ron Hubbard to assist parishioner in achieving a greater spiritualawareness and freedom." McShane February 27, 1995 Decl. 9 (emphasis added).Erlich responds that the works are essentially religious texts. Cf. FAC 9(describing Hubbard as author of "applied religious philosophy and spiritualhealing technology" and works as "training materials and course manuals of theScientology religion"). Erlich argues that the Church cannot have trade secretsbecause trade secret law is necessarily related to commerce. See <I>Kewanee Oil Co.v. Bicron Corp.,</I> 416 U.S. 470, 481, 485 (1974). The Church contends that, likeother organizations, it must pay bills, and that licensing fees from thesedocuments allow it to continue operating. McShane February 27, 1995 Decl. 7. <P>The Church's status as a religion does not itself preclude it from holding atrade secret. Restatement section 39 cmt. d, at 429 ("[N]onprofit entities suchas . . . religious organizations can also claim trade secret protection foreconomically valuable information such as lists of prospective members ordonors."); UTSA section 3426.1(c) (defining "person" to include a "corporation .. . or any other legal or commercial entity"); cf. <I>United Christian Scientists v.Christian Science Board of Directors,</I> 829 F.2d 1152, 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1987)(noting that Church was entitled to copyright protection on same basis asnonreligious groups). With the exception of the Vien case, there is littleauthority to support a finding that religious materials can constitute tradesecrets. However, there is "no category of information [that] is excluded fromprotection as a trade secret because of its inherent qualities." <I>Clark v. Bunker,</I>453 F.2d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir. 1972) (citing Restatement of Torts, section 757cmt. b. at 5) (upholding as a trade secret a "detailed plan for the creation,promotion, financing, and sale of contracts for 'prepaid' or 'pre-need' funeralservices"); see also <I>Smith v. Dravo Corp.,</I> 203 F.2d 369, 373 (7th Cir. 1953) ("Weassume that almost any knowledge or information used in the conduct of one'sbusiness may be held by its possessor in secret."). <P>Nor is there any authority to support Erlich's argument that the Church'sreligious texts cannot be trade secrets because, unlike most trade secrets, thesesecrets are not used in the production or sales of a commodity but are thecommodities themselves. The Church's Advanced Technology "course" materials,which are an integral part of the Church's spiritual counseling techniques, donot appear fundamentally different from the course manuals upheld as tradesecrets in <I>SmokEnders, Inc. v. Smoke No More, Inc.,</I> 184 U.S.P.Q. 309 (S.D. Fla.1974): <P><blockquote>The [SmokEnders ("SE") program requires attendees to follow a rigid structuredregimen comprised of specific assignments and detail[ed] concepts as recited in[the manual]. . . . <P>The SE program is a step-by-step regimented program which requires that eachperson attending a SE program perform each act of the program at a particulartime. Each act required by a SE seminar attendee must be performed by attendeesat the same time in the program, with each a minimum departure from the program. <P>The SE trade secret resides in the composite program as it is arranged forstep-by-step delivery to the attendees. <P></blockquote>Id. at 312 (emphasis added). SmokEnders is arguably distinguishable because onlythe "moderators" and not the attendees were given access to the course materialsin that case. However, the adherents of the Church, unlike the attendees and likethe moderators in SmokEnders, are under a duty of confidentiality as to thematerials. This case is analogous to SmokEnders because in both cases the"commodity" that is produced from the trade secrets is the result achieved by theperson using the course materials and their techniques (whether it be stoppingsmoking or reaching a "higher spiritual existence"). <P>Thus, there is at least some precedent for granting trade secret status to worksthat are techniques for improving oneself (though not specifically spiritually).Conversely, there is no authority for excluding religious materials from tradesecret protection because of their nature. Indeed, there is no authority forexcluding any type of information because of its nature. While the trade secretlaws did not necessarily develop to allow a religion to protect a monopoly in itsreligious practices, the laws have nonetheless expanded such that the Church'stechniques, which clearly are "used in the operation of the enterprise,"Restatement section 39, at 425, are deserving of protection if secret andvaluable. <P>Although trade secret status may apply to works that are techniques forspiritually improving oneself, the secret aspect of those techniques must bedefined with particularity. See Restatement section 39 cmt d, at 430 (requiringplaintiff to define the information claimed as a trade secret with sufficientdefiniteness). It appears that plaintiffs are claiming that the entire worksthemselves, which they describe as "processes and the theory behind thoseprocesses," constitute the trade secrets. See Pltfs.' Mem. in Support of Prelim.Inj. at 17. This definition is problematic because it is impossible to determinewhen the "secret" has been lost after portions of the works have been disclosed.Cf. F.A.C.T. Net, slip op. at 16 ("In the course of the hearing . . . RTC changedits position with regard to what materials constitute the purported tradesecrets."). Although plaintiffs' definition has at least some support inSmokEnders, where the court upheld as a trade secret a "composite [stop-smoking]program" found in an instructional manual, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 312, this court is notsatisfied that plaintiffs have identified their trade secrets with sufficientdefiniteness to support injunctive relief. <P>2. Independent Economic Value<P>A trade secret requires proof of "independent economic value, actual orpotential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons whocan obtain economic value from its disclosure or use." UTSA section 3426.1(d)(1).A trade secret must have sufficient value in the owner's operation of itsenterprise such that it provides an actual or potential advantage over others whodo not possess the information. Restatement section 39 cmt. e, at 430. <P>RTC's president, Warren McShane, attests that <P><blockquote>[t]he Advanced Technology is a source of substantial revenue for RTC in the formof licensing fees paid by Churches that are licensed to use the AdvancedTechnology. These Churches themselves receive a significant amount of theirincome from donations by parishioners for services based upon the AdvancedTechnology. These Churches pay RTC a percentage of the donations paid byparishioners for the services based upon the Advanced Technology. These donationsand fees provide the majority of operating expenses of these various Churchorganizations. <P></blockquote>McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 16; see also Vien, 827 F. Supp. at 633 (findingAdvanced Technology has value to Church by helping support its operationsworld-wide). The Church's need for revenues to support its services is no lessbecause of its status as a religion. Id. (citing <I>Murdock v. Commonwealth ofPennsylvania,</I> 319 U.S. 105, 111 (1943)). RTC points out that it receives sixpercent of what the individual churches receive in licensing fees. J. Kobrin May31, 1995 Decl, Ex. A ("McShane Depo."), at 43. This evidence is sufficient toestablish the value of the Advanced Technology works to the Church. <P>Erlich also argues that, to constitute a trade secret, information must give itsowner a competitive advantage, which implies that the Church must havecompetitors, as it did in Vien. See <I>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,</I> 467 U.S. 986,1011 n.15 (1984); <I>Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist,</I> 235 Cal. App. 3d 1, 18 (1991).Although Erlich is clearly not a "competitor" of the Church, there is norequirement that a trade secret have any value to the defendant; the value can beto "others who do not possess it." UTSA section 3426.1(d)(1). The Church hasadmitted, however, that it currently has no "competitors." McShane Depo. at 95.However, the definition of trade secret does not require that there currently becompetitors, only that there be actual or potential value from the informationbeing secret. Thus, potential competition is sufficient. Id. This evidence can beshown by direct evidence of the impact of the information on the business or bycircumstantial evidence of the resources invested in producing the information,the precautions taken to protect its secrecy, and the willingness of others topay for its access. Restatement section 39 cmt. e, at 431. The several pastinstances of breakaway Scientology-like groups exploiting RTC's AdvancedTechnology works for their profit constitute reasonable circumstantial evidencethat these works give the Church a competitive advantage. See McShane Depo. at93-94 (citing several former Church members who started rival factions); Vien,827 F. Supp. at 634 (describing a rival faction); Wollersheim, 796 F.2d at 1078(same). In fact, McShane's declaration constitutes direct evidence that the workshave a significant impact on the donations received by the Church, providing amajority of its operating expenses. McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 16. The status ofthe Advanced Technology works as trade secrets should not depend on Erlich's useof them. Accordingly, this court finds support for the court's conclusion in Vienthat the Church has shown independent economic value. <P>3. Secrecy<P>Information protectable as a trade secret where the owner has taken "effortsthat are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy." UTSAsection 3426.1(b)(2) (emphasis added). "Reasonable efforts" can include advisingemployees of the existence of a trade secret, limiting access to the informationon a "need to know basis," <I>Courtesy Temporary Service, Inc. v. Camacho,</I> 222 Cal.App. 3d 1278, 1288 (1990), requiring employees to sign confidentialityagreements. MAI, 991 F.2d at 521, and keeping secret documents under lock, 1Milgrim section 1.04, at 1-126. Accord Restatement section 39 cmt. g at 435. Thecourt finds that RTC has put forward sufficient evidence that it took steps thatwere reasonable under the circumstances to protect its purported trade secrets.RTC's president describes elaborate means taken to ensure the confidentiality ofthe Advanced Technology works, including use of locked cabinets, safes, loggingand identification of the materials, availability of the materials at only ahandful of sites worldwide, electronic sensors attached to documents, lockedbriefcases for transporting works, alarms, photo identifications, securitypersonnel, and confidentiality agreements for all of those given access to thematerials. McShane February 8, 1995 Decl. 13-18. McShane testifies that allcopies of the Advanced Technology works that are outside of the Church weregained through improper means, such as by theft. Id. 22-24. Thirty-five otherdeclarants confirm that the measures mentioned by McShane have been used, thoughnot in exactly the same manner, in other Churches and at other times. See, e.g.,Sydejko Decl. (describing measures used at Erlich's facilities during relevanttime period); Byrne Decl. 15 (stating works have been kept confidential since atleast 1968). There is further evidence that Erlich himself signed confidentialityagreements with respect to the Advanced Technology materials and, specifically,the upper-level "NOTS" course materials. See McShane February 8, 1995 Decl., Exs.H-I; McShane February 27, 1995 Decl., Exs. D-F; McShane Depo. at 201-03; H.Kobrin Marcy 31, 1995 Decl., Ex. A ("Erlich Depo."), at 84-88. The court isunpersuaded by Erlich's claims that the Church's measures have not covered alllocations where the Advanced Technology works are found and do not cover crucialtime periods.[FN24] Efforts at maintaining secrecy need not be extreme, justreasonable under the circumstances. Legislative Committee Comment - Senate, Cal.Civ. Code section 3426.1, at 147 (West Supp. 1995). The church has made more thanan adequate showing on this issue.[FN25] <P>Erlich raises a number of objections to the Church's claims of confidentiality.Erlich argues that the Church's trade secrets have been made available to thepublic through various means. The unprotected disclosure of a trade secret willcause the information to forfeit its trade secret status, since "[i]nformationthat is generally known or readily ascertainable through proper means by others .. . is not protectable as a trade secret." Restatement section 39 cmt. f, at 432;see also Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1(d); Kewanee Oil, 416 U.S. at 484; <I>ChicagoLock Co. v. Fanberg,</I> 676 F.2d 400, 404 (9th Cir. 1982); 1 Milgrim at 1-135. Oncetrade secrets have been exposed to the public, they cannot later be recalled. Inre Remington Avenue Arms Co., 952 F.2d 1029, 1033 (8th Cir. 1991); Smith, 203F.2d at 373. <P>Erlich argues that many of the Advanced Technology documents have been availablein open court records in another case. <I>Church of Scientology Int'l v. Fishman,</I>Case No. 91-6426 HLH (C.D. Cal.), destroying the necessary element of secrecy.Cf. Lerma, slip op. at 2 (noting that some of Advanced Technology works wereavailable in the court file in Fishman and that they were not subject to asealing or protective order). However, the Fishman court recently issued an ordersealing the file pending a decision on whether the documents are trade secrets.Even if those records were temporarily open to the public, the court will notassume that their contents have been generally disclosed, especially when thisquestion is still pending before the district court in Fishman. Such adisclosure, without evidence that the secrets have become generally known, doesnot necessarily cause RTC to forfeit its trade secrets. See <I>Gates Rubber Co. v.Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.,</I> 9 F.3d 823, 848-49 (10th Cir. 1993) (findingthat information retained its secret status despite being disclosed at hearing,where plaintiff evidenced continuing intent to maintain its secrecy by acting toseal the record). The contrary result would mean that if documents were everfiled without a sealing order, even for a short time, the court would not be ableto decide that they should be sealed because the documents would have lost theirpotential trade secret status by virtue of the temporary unsealing. The only fairresult would be to allow trade secret status for works that are otherwiseprotectable as trade secrets unless they were somehow made generally available tothe public during the period they were unsealed, such as by publication. <P>Erlich further asserts that the Advanced Technology has been largely disclosedin the popular press, as evidenced by various publications attached to the BergerDeclaration, which was originally filed in the Fishman case.[FN26] These articlesmay reveal information referring to or hinting at the trade secrets, but may notdisclose the secrets themselves, see McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 12 (catalogingwhat was disclosed by the Exhibits in Fishman).[FN27] However, as previouslynoted, the court is not certain how to properly define the "secrets." To theextent that someone uses or discloses any information taken from any of thesearticles, there is clearly no trade secret claim. However, much of Erlich'spostings copied all or almost all of sections of the Advanced Technology works,which is far more than has ever been disclosed in the popular press. See id.12-15. In fact, several of the works posted by Erlich are not mentioned in any ofthe clippings in the Berger declaration. Id. Arguably, the Church's allegedsecrets are such that their value depends on the availability of the completecourses and not mere fragments, thus disclosures that describe parts of the worksor disclose isolated portions do not necessarily suffice to ruin the value of theentire works as secrets. Cf. SmokEnders, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 317 (finding thatsecret's value can be from unified design including components that areindividually in the public domain). However, without a clearer definition of whatconstitute the "secrets," the court is unable to determine whether some have beenmade generally known to the public.[FN28] <P>Finally, Erlich newly emphasizes in his Reply that the works he posted were notsecrets because he received them through proper means: eight of the documentswere allegedly previously posted anonymously to a public portion of the Internetand one of the documents (item 1 of Exhibit B) allegedly came to Erlichanonymously through the U.S. mail. Erlich claims that because the alleged tradesecrets were received from "public sources," they should lose their trade secretprotection. Although the Internet is a new technology, it requires no great leapto conclude that because more than 25 million people could have accessed thenewsgroup postings from which Erlich alleges he received the Exhibit B works,these works would lose their status as secrets. While the Internet has notreached the status where a temporary posting on a newsgroup is akin topublication in a major newspaper or on a television network, those with aninterest in using the Church's trade secrets to compete with the Church arelikely to look to the newsgroup. Thus, posting works to the Internet makes them"generally known" to the relevant people - the potential "competitors" of theChurch. <P>The court is troubled by the notion that any Internet user, including thoseusing "anonymous remailers"[FN29] to protect their identity, can destroy valuableintellectual property rights by posting them over the Internet, especially giventhe fact that there is little opportunity to screen postings before they aremade. See Eduardo M. Carreras, "Intellectual Property: First Casualty on theInformation Highway," 13 No. 1 ACCA Docket 26 (Westlaw) ("Carreras") (Jan.-Feb.1995) at *29-*32 (suggesting that trade secret protection is lost as soon asinformation is disclosed on the Internet). Nonetheless, one of the Internet'svirtues, that it gives even the poorest individuals the power to publish tomillions of readers, see Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do," 104Yale L.J. 1805, 1806-07 (1995), can also be a detriment to the value ofintellectual property rights. The anonymous (or judgment proof) defendant canpermanently destroy valuable trade secrets, leaving no one to hold liable for themisappropriation. See Carreras at *30. Although a work posted to an Internetnewsgroup remains accessible to the public for only a limited amount of time,once that trade secret has been released into the public domain there is noretrieving it. In re Remington Arms, 952 F.2d at 1033. While the court ispersuaded by the Church's evidence that those who made the original postingslikely gained the information through improper means, as no one outside theChurch or without a duty of confidence would have had access to thoseworks,[FN30] this does not negate the finding that, once posted, the works losttheir secrecy. Although Erlich cannot rely on his own improper postings tosupport the argument that the Church's documents are no longer secrets, see 3Milgrim section 15.01[1][a][ii], at 15-43, evidence that another individual hasput the alleged trade secrets into the public domain prevents RTC from furtherenforcing its trade secret rights in those materials. Because there is noevidence that Erlich is a privy of any of the alleged original misappropriators,he is not equitably estopped from raising their previous public disclosures as adefense to his disclosure.<I> Underwater Storage, Inc. v. United States Rubber Co.,</I>371 F.2d 950, 955 (D.C. Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 911 (1967) ("Once thesecret is out, the rest of the world may well have a right to copy it at will;but this should not protect the misappropriator or his privies."). The court isthus convinced that those postings made by Erlich were of materials that werepossibly already generally available to the public. See Lerma, slip op. at 14-15(finding that RTC could not show the Advanced Technology works were not"generally known" to support injunctive relief); F.A.C.T. Net, slip op, at 16(same). Therefore, RTC has not shown a likelihood of success on an essentialelement of its trade secret claim.[FN31] <P>4. Conclusion and Alternative Test<P>Because RTC is the plaintiff, and because it is moving for injunctive relief, itbears the burden of proving its trade secrets. 3 Milgrim section 15.01[1]. Thecourt finds that RTC has failed to adequately define its trade secrets and, atleast as to those works that have been made available to the public throughprevious Internet postings not by Erlich, RTC has failed to meet its burden onthe issue of secrecy. Therefore, RTC has failed to show a likelihood of successon its trade secret misappropriation claim. <P>RTC's failure to prove a likelihood of success on its trade secret claim ofsecrecy does not necessarily preclude it from showing an entitlement 1to apreliminary injunction. RTC can meet the second formulation of the preliminaryinjunction test by showing a combination of serious questions going to the meritsof its trade secret claim and that the balance of hardships tips in its favor.However, since the trade secrets have not been adequately defined, the courtcannot find that serious questions going to the merits have been sufficientlyraised to justify a preliminary injunction on the trade secret claim. Until RTCbetter describes what its trade secrets are, it is impossible to determinewhether previous public disclosures of parts of the Advanced Technology works aresufficient to destroy the secrecy of the entire work. While parts of many of theworks have been mentioned in various published articles and books, the court isunclear what effect such disclosures would have on the secrecy and value of anentire work. The court is also not entirely persuaded by RTC's argument that itssecrets have competitive value to future breakaway groups. These issues will haveto be resolved before RTC can ultimately prevail on its trade secret claims. <P><B>D. Irreparable Injury and Balance of Hardships </B><P>The court will presume irreparable harm for the copyright claim becauseplaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claims of infringement.<I>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Systems, Inc.,</I> 886 F.2d 1173, 1174 (9thCir. 1989); <I>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula International, Inc.,</I> 725 F.2d 521(9th Cir. 1984). <P><B>E. First Amendment Concerns</B><P>In his Reply, Erlich argues that there is a strong presumption against anyinjunction that could act as a "prior restraint" on free speech, citing <I>CBS, Inc.v. Davis,</I> 114 S. Ct. 912, 913-14 (1994) (Justice Blackmun, as Circuit Justice,staying a preliminary injunction prohibiting CBS from airing footage from insidemeat packing plant). The court notes, however, that the 1976 Act explicitlysanctions the use of preliminary injunctions in the case of copyrightinfringement. 17 U.S.C. sections 501(a), 502(a). The Supreme Court has recognizedthat the Copyright Act itself embodies a balance between the rights of copyrightholders, guaranteed by the Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, section 8, and theprotections of the First Amendment. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 557-60; In reCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., 918 F.2d 140, 143-44 (11th Cir. 1990). The doctrine offair use already considers First Amendment concerns. New Era PublicationsInternational, <I>ApS v. Henry Holt & Co.,</I> 873 F.2d 576, 584 (2d Cir. 1989), cert.denied, 493 U.S. 1094 (1990) (rejecting defendant's argument that First Amendmentconcerns precluded granting an injunction, though finding other equitableconsiderations dictated denial of injunctive relief). Because Erlich is able tocontinue to criticize the Church and use its published and unpublished works tothe extent allowed by the doctrine of fair use and because the injunctive reliefsought is no broader than necessary to protect plaintiffs' copyrights, Erlich'sFirst Amendment interests have been adequately considered. <P><B>F. Conclusion</B><P>Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their copyrightclaims except as to item 4 of Exhibit A, for which the copyright has expired.Plaintiffs gain the benefit of a presumption of irreparable harm as to thisclaim. Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunctionprohibiting any further copying of plaintiffs' copyrighted Exhibit A and B workspending a trial on the merits, except as to item 4 of Exhibit A and as allowed bythe doctrine of fair use.[FN32] Under the fair use doctrine, Erlich may post, orotherwise publish, his criticism of the Church, using plaintiffs' copyrightedExhibit A and B works to the extent necessary to carry out his critical purpose.However, the court notes that copying the works in their entirety with verylittle added criticism is almost certainly not fair use. <P>Accordingly, the court grants in part and denies in part plaintiffs' applicationfor a preliminary injunction and Erlich' motion to dissolve the TRO. <P><H3>III. PLAINTIFFS' APPLICATION TO EXPAND THE TRO </H3>Plaintiffs have applied to expand the scope of the preliminary injunctionagainst Erlich to include more of plaintiffs' works that are allegedly protectedby copyright and trade secret law, beyond those listed in Exhibits A and B of theFAC. This request comes after plaintiffs maintain that Erlich violated a promisehe made to the court to convince it to continue the contempt hearing. On March14, 1995, counsel for Erlich stated that Erlich "would agree not to publish anyof Mr. Ron Hubbard's writings, or copyright-registered writings of the Church ofScientology, until the contempt hearing." See March 16, 1995 Order SettingHearing Dates. Plaintiffs seek to expand the number of documents covered by theinjunction to include 52 works because Erlich allegedly "furnished a copy ofanother copyrighted, confidential work, taken from the same course as thedocument which he posted in his first violation of the TRO, to a litigant inanother lawsuit." Ex Parte App. for Amended TRO at 4. However, plaintiffs havenot provided Erlich or the court with the registrations for these materials toallow a determination that they are the subject of valid copyright interests. Thescope of this case should not be expanded to encompass all or a large number ofHubbard's copyrighted works merely because Erlich made a promise to allow thepostponement of the contempt hearing. Now that there has been a contempt hearing,and given the court's finding that Erlich was not in contempt, see part IV infra,the court does not believe that an overly expansive preliminary injunction isappropriate. In fact, a broad injunction which goes beyond the scope of theallegedly infringing activities should be avoided for First Amendment reasons.See 3 Nimmer section 14.06[C], at 14-106 to -109 (noting that scope of injunctionshould be coterminous with, and no broader than, infringement); In re CapitalCities/ABC, Inc., 918 F.2d at 144 (calling for a "surgical" restraint toaccommodate First Amendment rights). Accordingly, the court denies plaintiffs'application for an expansion of the injunctive relief.[FN33] <P>Request To Seize Erlich's Computer<P>The court finds plaintiffs' request that Erlich's computer and other equipmentbe seized to be wholly without merit. No amount of excessive copying in thecontext of criticism, which is potentially subject to a valid fair use defense,would warrant such a seizure. Here, Erlich's equipment is hardly an instrument ofinfringement. Rather, it is essential to the operation of his business and otheraffairs. While a specifically-tailored injunction in a copyright case does notoffend the First Amendment, attempting to shut down a critic's speech activities,including those that do not implicate the copyright laws in the least, wouldconstitute an unwarranted prior restraint on speech. Cf. 3 Nimmer section14.06[C], at 14-107 to -109; <I>RCA Records v. All-Fast Systems, Inc.,</I> 594 F. Supp.335, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (where action not against record pirates, court shouldnot seize equipment which can be used for non-infringing purposes). <P><H3>IV. MOTION FOR CONTEMPT</H3>The Ninth Circuit set forth the standards for civil contempt in In re Dual-DeckVideo Cassette Antitrust Litigation, 10 F.3d 693 (9th Cir. 1993): <P><blockquote>Civil contempt in this context consists of a party's disobedience to a specificand definite court order by failure to take all reasonable steps within theparty's power to comply. The contempt "need not be willful," and there is no goodfaith exception to the requirement of obedience to a court order. But a personshould not be held in contempt if his action "appears to be based on a good faithand reasonable interpretation of the [court's order].'" "Substantial compliance"with the court order is a defense to civil contempt, and is not vitiated by "afew technical violations" where every reasonable effort has been made to comply. <P>The party alleging civil contempt must demonstrate that the alleged contemnorviolated the court's order by "clear and convincing evidence," not merely apreponderance of the evidence. <P></blockquote>This set of rules is easy to articulate but difficult to apply. [The court mustproperly determine] (1) that [plaintiff] violated the court order, (2) beyondsubstantial compliance, (3) not based on a good faith and reasonableinterpretation of the order, (4) by clear and convincing evidence. <P>Id. at 695 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs allege that Erlich has violated theterms of the Amended TRO on three separate occasions. <P><B>A. First Alleged Contempt</B><P>First, plaintiffs allege that Erlich was in contempt of this court's February10, 1995 TRO or its February 23, 1995 Amended TRO when, on February 26, 1995,Erlich posted portions of item 1 of Exhibit B, the Class VIII "Assists" tapetranscript ("the Assists transcript"). Erlich contends that he had not receivedthe court's Amended TRO at the time he made the posting. At the time of theposting, Erlich was not yet represented by counsel. The court's original TROenjoined Erlich from making certain uses of the Exhibit A and B works, but didnot make clear that Erlich could make fair use of the non-trade secret Exhibit Aworks. From the content of Erlich's posting, it seems that Erlich thought he wasengaging in fair use of the Assists transcript. While the court did notexplicitly indicate that Erlich could make "fair use" of any of the unpublished,confidential Exhibit B works at the February 21, 1995 hearing, the courtindicated that its Amended TRO would "prohibit any publication of confidentialmatter or any publication of copyrighted matter that was not that which is faircriticism or comment or fair use." Erlich's March 15, 1995 Opp'n, Ex. A, Tr.30-31. Elrich may have reasonably misconstrued this language so that he believedthe exception for fair use also modified the first clause, "prohibit[ing] anypublication of confidential matter," especially given Erlich's pro se status atthe hearing. Accordingly, the court does not find that plaintiffs have shown byclear and convincing evidence that Erlich's mistake was not a "good faith andreasonable interpretation of the [court's oral] order." In re Dual-Deck VideoCassette Antitrust Litigation, 10 F.3d at 695. Although the court is notconvinced that Erlich's use of the Exhibit B works, to which the fair use defensewould not have applied at the time, was in any case a fair use, the defense wasnot adequately explained in the context of the hearing such that Erlich'sviolation could be considered a violation of a "specific and definite" courtorder. See id. <P><B>B. Second Alleged Contempt</B><P>Plaintiffs allege that Erlich provided copies of one of Hubbard's AdvancedTechnology writings to another litigant to be used in a declaration. As the courtfound in its May 5, 1995 "Order Denying Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Application ToShorten Time re Contempt Hearing," plaintiffs have not demonstrated how Erlichhas clearly violated the Amended TRO, which prohibited certain uses of theExhibits to the complaint, by attaching to a declaration a work not listed in theExhibits to the complaint but merely "related to" one of those works. Plaintiffshave submitted to new evidence on this issue that would lead the court to changeits earlier ruling. <P><B>C. Third Alleged Contempt</B><P>Third, plaintiffs allege that on May 15, 1995, an interview of Erlich appearedon a BBC television show which contained a segment related to this case.Plaintiffs have attached a declaration stating that plaintiffs believe Erlichdisclosed information "taken right out of" one part of the Advanced Technologylisted in Exhibit B-1[FN34] to the First Amended Complaint. Erlich disputes thathe disclosed any portion of the Exhibit B works on the British television show,and argues that the information he disclosed is already widely available to thepublic, as evidenced by several articles in newspapers and magazines. Erlichfurther objects to the declaration of Warren McShane offered by plaintiffs, as itlacks foundation for the content of the BBC interview. Even accepting thevalidity of McShane's declaration regarding what was disclosed on the BBC show,the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to prove by clear and convincingevidence that Erlich in fact disclosed any of the Exhibit B works which were thesubject of the Amended TRO. To the extent that Erlich' extremely brief statementrelating to the Advanced Technology discloses information from one of thoseworks, the court further finds that Erlich stated nothing more than has appearedin numerous newspaper and magazine articles and books about the Church. See,e.g., Joel Sappell & Robert W. Welkos, "The Man Behind the Religion" L.A. Times,June 24, 1990, at A36, Oakley May 31, 1995 Decl., Ex. C, at 81. <P><H3>V. ERLICH'S MOTION TO VACATE WRIT OF SEIZURE</H3>Erlich challenges the February 10, 1995 writ of seizure[FN35] on the groundsthat it was not authorized under the Federal Rules and that it isunconstitutionally overbroad. Erlich seeks the vacation of the writ of seizure,the return of all materials seized, and an increase in the amount of the bond. <P>Erlich argues that the writ of seizure is invalid because plaintiffs did notcomply with the requirements of Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure. Plaintiffs respond that the seizure was authorized by the SupremeCourt's Copyright Rules, which provide for a summary process of seizure separatefrom the Federal Rules. Plaintiffs further argue that, even if Rule 65(b)applies, its requirements were met prior to the issuance of the writ. <P><B>A. SUPREME COURT'S COPYRIGHT RULES</B><P>The 1976 Act provides for the impoundment of allegedly infringing articles: <P><blockquote>At any time while an action under this title is pending, the court may order theimpounding, on such terms as it deems reasonable, of all copies . . . claimed tohave been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights,and of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or otherarticles by means of which such copies . . . may be reproduced. <P></blockquote>17 U.S.C. section 503(a) (emphasis added). Unlike the 1909 Act, the 1976 Actgives the court discretion whether to issue an impounding order. 3 Nimmer section14.07, at 14-112. <P>In 1909, the Supreme Court issued Copyright Rules ("Rules"), pursuant to section25(e) of the 1909 Act, setting forth procedures for seizure and impoundment.

P. 65(b) where seizure not authorized by Rules). <P>Plaintiffs cite <I>Duchess Music Corp. v. Stern,</I> 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert.denied sub nom. <I>Rosner v. Duchess Music Corp.,</I> 409 U.S. 847 (1972) to supporttheir position that the Rules still permit a summary procedure for the ex partegranting of writs of seizure. In Duchess, the Ninth Circuit reversed the districtcourt's order that certain seized items be returned, holding that "[n]either the[1909 Act] nor the Supreme Court rules give the District Court any discretion todetermine what to impound" and that the "process Congress granted the aggrievedcopyright proprietor is a summary one." Id. at 1308. Given the discretionarylanguage of the 1976 Act, and the expansion of the Fifth Amendment in cases suchas <I>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.,</I> 416 U.S. 600 (1974), the court finds plaintiffs'reliance on the Copyright Rules and Duchess to be misplaced. Instead the courtfinds persuasive the reasoning of the courts in Paramount and WPOW questioningthe current validity of the summary process approved by the 1909 Act and SupremeCourt Rules and requiring plaintiffs to meet the requirements of Rule 65(b) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <P><B>B. Requirements of Rule 65(b)</B><P>Rule 65(b) provides that ex parte injunctive relief will be granted <P><blockquote>only if (1) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by theverified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage willresult to the applicant before the adverse party or that party's attorney can beheard in opposition, and (2) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court inwriting the . . . reasons supporting the claim that notice should not berequired. <P> </blockquote>Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b) (emphasis added).<P>1. Irreparable Injury<P>In their ex parte applications for relief, plaintiffs argued that interiminjunctive relief was necessary because Erlich had repeatedly infringedplaintiffs' copyrighted works, even after being warned by plaintiffs. In hisdeposition, McShane testified that plaintiffs would suffer injury from Erlich'sunauthorized posting of plaintiff's works because "if people read those documentsthey're not supposed to, and if that affects them from ever doing the service,stops them from doing the service, obviously they won't make donations to thechurch which will directly affect RTC economically." Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. B,at 112. McShane also stated that he was "quite concerned that [Erlich] willcontinue to defy requests to cease infringement even if ordered to do so by theCourt. Mr. Erlich has already placed multiple copyrighted works, includingseveral that are confidential, onto a massive computer network potentiallyaccessed by 25 million people." McShane February 8, 1995 Decl. Paragraph 56. Thecourt finds this evidence sufficient to establish a likelihood that, absent awrit of seizure, Erlich would have continued to post plaintiffs' copyrightedworks prior to a hearing. Such a likelihood of further infringement before Erlichcould respond, combined with a reasonable likelihood of success on the copyrightinfringement claim, allows the court to presume irreparable injury. See Apple,725 F.2d at 525 (holding that reasonable likelihood of success of copyrightinfringement claim allows presumption of irreparable injury); WPOW, 584 F.Supp.at 138 (allowing presumption in context of impoundment. <P>2. Reasons Why Notice Should Not Be Required <P>The second element of Rule 65(b) permits injunctive relief without notice onlywhere notice to the adverse party is impossible, in some limited circumstances,where notice would render further action fruitless. First Technology, 11 F.3d at650. Plaintiffs may meet the latter exception to the notice requirement byshowing that Erlich "would have disregarded a direct court order and disposed ofthe goods within the time it would take for a hearing." Id.; 3 Nimmer Section14.07, at 14-115. This may be shown with evidence of a defendant's history ofviolating court orders or destroying evidence, such as in the case of a member ofa counterfeiting ring who, if given notice, would simply transfer his inventoriesto another member of the ring.[FN36] Id.; In re Vuitton et Fills S.A., 606 F.2d1,4-5 (2d Cir. 1979). Plaintiffs provide evidence of the need for a pre-noticeseizure: Erlich stated that the decision whether to stop posting Scientologyworks was his and that "[n]o local government or court in the [U.S.] has thepower to tell [him] otherwise." FAC, Ex. J. Although the court was persuaded atthe time of its seizure order that this evidence indicated that there was achance that Erlich would not follow a court order, the court has reconsidered itsoriginal conclusion. Erlich's statement of defiance, made in the context of anexchange of hostile letters between the parties, does not rise to the levelnecessary to meet Rule 65(b)'s demanding requirements for dispensing with notice.Further, other than this isolated statement, there was no evidence of Erlich'spropensity to defy a court order. The court does not find that this case isanalogous to that of a counterfeiter who, if given notice, might transfer theinfringing works elsewhere. Erlich is not "engaged primarily in illegitimate andinfringing activities and [is thus not]likely to disregard an order from [thecourt] preventing [him] form disposing of or destroying any [evidence ofinfringement]." Paramount, 821 F. Supp. at 89. The court further notes thatplaintiffs already had evidence of Erlich's infringing copies in the form of thenewsgroup postings, thereby reducing the importance of preserving other evidenceof infringement. Because there was an insufficient showing under Rule 65(b) tosupport a writ of seizure, the writ must be vacated.[FN37] <P><B>C. Unconstitutionally Overbroad?</B><P>Although the court has found that the requirements of Rule 65(b) were notsufficiently met, the court further notes that one aspect of the order wasoverbroad. "It is well settled that the Fourth Amendment prohibition againstunreasonable intrusions...governs not only criminal investigations but alsosearches and seizures make pursuant to civil proceedings." Paramount, 821 F.Supp.at 90 (citing <I>Soldal v. Cook County,</I> Ill., 113 S.Ct. 538, 546 & n.10 (1992)),including "seizure orders directing the United States Marshal to impoundallegedly infringing articles under the Copyright Act," id. (citing <I>Warner Bros.,Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc.,</I> 677 F.Supp. 740, 765 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd inpart, rev'd in part on other grounds, 877 F.2d 1120 (2d Cir. 1989)). To complywith the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, a writ of seizure should specifywith particularity the premises to be searched and the articles to be seized. Id.The scope of the search must thus be limited by "the object of the search and theplaces in which there has been a showing that the object is likely to be found"Id. (citing <I>Maryland v. Garrison,</I> 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987)). The order should"enable the executing officer to ascertain and identify with reasonable certaintythose items that the [court] has authorized him to seize." <I>Time WarnerEntertainment Co. v. Does,</I> 876 F. Supp. 407, 413 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (citing <I>UnitedStates v. George,</I> 975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 1992)). <P>The purpose of preliminary injunctive relief is to maintain the status quo.Impoundment is also meant to allow for a possible remedy of destruction of theinfringing articles. 3 Nimmer Section 14.07, at 14-119. The the extend that theorder allowed the seizure of "articles and things that appear to be works of L.Ron Hubbard protected by copyrights," it went beyond the purpose of the CopyrightAct to prevent the unauthorized "reproduction" of protected works; the merepossession of copyrighted works does not offend the Copyright Act. This languageis also somewhat vague, as it describes a category of works which cannot beidentified by any easy to apply criteria. The criteria used to determine whatitems are to be seized must not be overly subjective, such that the decision ofwhat to seize rests solely in the hands of plaintiffs' expert rather than theU.S. Marshal. Paramount, 821 F.Supp. at 91. (finding application constitutionallydeficient where only some of distinguishing markings for identifying unauthorizedvideocassettes were listed in plaintiffs' application); Time Warner, 876 F.Supp.at 413 (finding plaintiffs' application insufficient where murky photocopies ofcopyrighted designs and trademarks provided insufficient guidance to marshal).Here, there were no specific criteria given by which a marshal could identifywhich works were written by Hubbard and were protected by copyrights. In effect,this language gave plaintiffs' experts the authority to search through Erlich'spossessions and computer files using their discretion in deciding what to seize,unchecked by any law enforcement officials. <P>Plaintiffs contend, however, that its use of a computer expert to enable thesearch of materials on Erlich's computers and an expert in the works ofScientology to enable the identification of plaintiffs' works was justified,citing a criminal case, <I>State v. Wade,</I> 544 So.2d 1028, 1030-31 (Fla. Dist. Ct.App. 1989). In Wade, the Florida appellate court upheld a search for stolencomputer equipment where law enforcement officers were aided by computerconsultants employed by the victim computer manufacturer. Id. The Wade courtreasoned that searches in areas beyond law enforcement officers' expertisenecessitate the use of experts and noticed that the employees of the victim areperhaps the best experts to identify the allegedly stolen equipment. Id. at `030(citing 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search & Seizure Section 4.11(b), at 343 (1987)(commenting that practice of using victims to help advise in search inunobjectionable in exceptional situations such as where only the victim canadequately identify what items are stolen)).[FN38] The court finds that, in thecontext of identification of allegedly infringing copies of literary works, useof an expert to aid the marshal my be justified. In this case, the number ofpotentially infringed works was too great to permit the plaintiffs to bringoriginals to be used in verifying the source of copies. Accordingly, plaintiffswere justified in using an expert to identify the allegedly infringing works.Accordingly, plaintiffs were justified to aid in finding the materials.[FN39] SeeWade, 544 S.2d at 1030; cf Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. C, at 200 (Erlich Depo.)(indicating that police officers at seizure were not computer literate). <P>However, such works should have been adequately identified before the seizure to"ensure[] that the search [would] be carefully tailored to its justifications and[would] take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches theFramers intended to prohibit." Paramount, 821 F.Supp. at 90 (quoting Garrison,480 U.S. at 84). The inclusion of language allowing the seizure of "any articlesand things appearing to be works of L. Ron Hubbard protected by copyrights"arguably made the writ overbroad, giving RTC officials too much discretion inidentifying Hubbard works and in determining which works were subject tocopyright protection and which copies were unauthorized. In effect, plaintiffs'agents were given the authority to seize even lawfully owned copies of Hubbard'sworks for which there was no evidence of any infringing use, which exceeds theauthority of 17 U.S.C. Section 503(a). <P><B>D. Conclusion</B><P>Because plaintiffs' ex parte application for a writ of seizure did not meet therequirements of Rule 65(b), the court vacates the writ. Plaintiffs must return toErlich all articles seized within ten (10) days of this order.[FN40] <P><H3>VI. Plaintiffs' Request For Sanctions Against Carla Oakley </H3>The court is disturbed by the parties' seemingly endless applications to thecourt, consolidated oppositions, sur-replies, objections to sur-replies, andother such inappropriate pleadings. In their objections to Erlich's "ConsolidatedOpposition to Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications," plaintiffs request thatErlich's counsel, Ms. Carla Oakley, be sanctioned under Rule 11 of the FederalRules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. Section 1927 for filing "frivolous"pleading which multiply the proceedings "unreasonable and vexatiously." <P>To the extent that the Consolidated Opposition contains new arguments, the courtfinds that these arguments are necessary to address plaintiffs' multiple ex parteapplications alleging three different instances of contempt. Erlich's sur-replyto the motion to expand the TRO was arguably justified by plaintiffs' mention ofa new instance of alleged contempt for the first time in their Reply.[FN41] Thecourt therefore denies plaintiff's' requests for sanctions. Plaintiffs' requestthat the court strike the arguments in the Consolidated Opposition because theyare merely repetitive arguments that were "cut and past[ed]" from previous briefsis unnecessary to the extent that the briefs add noting new. However, the courtorders that the parties not file any further post-Reply briefing, which onlywastes the court's and parties' resources, without first seeking leave of thecourt. See Civil L.R. 7-3(e). The court further rejects plaintiffs' claim thatErlich's "Consolidated Opposition" reveals alleged trade secrets from plaintiffs'Advanced Technology works, and should have been filed under seal. Nothing in the"Consolidated Opposition" reveals information not already publicized in thepopular press. See supra part IV.C. <P><H3>VII. Order</H3>For the reasons set forth above, the court orders as follows: <P><UL>1. Defendant Dennis Erlich and his agents, servants, and employees, all personalacting or purporting to act under his authority, direction or control, and allpersons acting in concert or in participation with any of them who receive noticeof this Order, shall be and are restrained and enjoined pending further courtorder: <P><UL>a. From all unauthorized reproduction, transmission, and publication of any ofthe works of L. Ron Hubbard that are protected under the Copyright Act of 1976,as codified in its amended form at 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. Such works arefound, for the purposes of this order only, to be those works identified inExhibits A and B to the complaint, except for item 4 of Exhibit A. A copy of saidexhibits are attached hereto with item 4 of Exhibit A redacted. <P>i. Unauthorized reproduction, transmission, or publication includes placement ofa copyrighted work into a computer's hard drive or other storage device;"browsing" the text of a copyrighted work resident on another computer throughon-screen examination; scanning a copyrighted work into a digital file;"uploading" a digital file containing a copyrighted work from the computer to abulletin board system or other server; "downloading" a digital file containing acopyrighted work from a bulletin board system or other server to the computer;and "quoting" a copyrighted work that is cited in an on-line message in sending,responding to or forwarding that message. <P>ii. Nothing in this section of the order shall be construed to prohibit fair useof such works, as set forth in 17 U.S.C. Section 107 and interpreted byapplicable case law. Fair use of the copyright material for the purposes of thisorder includes use of the copyrighted work for the purpose of criticism, newsreporting, teaching, scholarship, and research but does not include: (1) use ofthe material for a commercial purpose where the user stand to profit formexploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price orgiving the usual consideration or sue that would have a significant effect on thepotential market value of the copyrighted work; (2) use which fulfills the demandfor the original work; (3) use of the heart of the work -- no more of a work maybe taken than is necessary to make any accompanying comment understandable. Withrespect to unpublished materials, the amount of copied material must compriseonly a very small percentage of the copyrighted works both from a quantitativeand a qualitative standpoint. <P>iii. The prior postings by defendant Erlich that form the basis of this order donot qualify as fair use primarily because of the quantity of the material postedand the very limited transformative use made of those materials. Identical orsimilar postings are therefore enjoined. <P>b. From destroying, altering, concealing or removing from the district in whichdefendant Erlich resides, any reproduction, copy, facsimile, excerpt, orderivative of any work of L. Ron Hubbard that is described in Exhibit A or Bincluding all such works returned pursuant to this order. Defendant Erlich or hiscounsel shall safely retain possession of any such items. <P>c. A condition of this preliminary injunction is that a $25,000 bond shall beposted (or continued in place) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).<P></ul>2. Plaintiffs' application to expand the TRO is denied without prejudice. <P>3. Plaintiffs' motion for a finding of contempt against defendant Erlich isdenied. <P>4. Plaintiffs are ordered to return within ten (10) days of the date of thisorder to defendant Erlich through his counsel all items seized pursuant to thewrit of seizure issued February 10, 1995. <P>5. Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against defendant Erlich's counsel, Ms.Carla Oakley, is denied. <P></ul>DATED: 9/22/95<P>/s/ RONALD M.

First Am. Comp. ("FAC")9. The Ninth Circuit described the Church's teachings as follows: <P>The Church . . . teaches that a person's behavior and well-being are improved byremoving "engrams" from the unconscious mind. Engrams are impressions recorded bythe unconscious mind in times of trauma in this life or in previous lifes.Engrams return in moments of similar stress to the detriment of the person'sbehavior. Removing engrams from the unconscious permits the person's analyticalmind to function unhindered. <P>Engrams are located and purged through "auditing." Auditing uses the"technology" and "advanced technology" of the Church. . . . The adherent mustproceed through a series of increasingly sophisticated technologies of closelystructured questions and answers to reach "a higher spiritual existence." <P>The Church asserts that the unsupervised, premature exposure of an adherent tothese materials will produce a spiritually harmful effect. <P>Religious Technology Center v.

"Posting," asa noun, refers to an article in a newsgroup and, as a verb, refers to the act ofsending an article one has written for distribution to the newsgroup'ssubscribers. When a message is posted to a group, it is distributed to thecomputers of all those systems that subscribe to that group so that the users ofthat system can access the message. There are currently thousands of differentnewsgroups, with about 50,000 new articles posted each day. John R. Levine &Carol Baroudi, The Internet for Dummies 131 (2d ed. 1994). <P>(6) Erlich gained access to the Internet by using a personal computer and amodem in his home to connect to defendant Klemesrud's BBS, to which Erlich wasone of 512 subscribers paying an annual fee. Klemesrud Decl. 13. Klemesrud's BBS,in turn, was connected to the Internet through an arrangement with defendantNetcom under which Klemesrud leased access to the Internet at a fixed rate. <P>(7) These works are part of the "course" materials used in the upper-levels ofScientology training, and are only available to those Scientologists who havesuccessfully completed all of the lower courses. <P>(8) The parties treated the motion to dissolve the TRO as superseding theearlier application for a preliminary injunction. The court finds no differencesin the legal standards for dissolving a TRO and for granting a preliminaryinjunction, except for the potentially different relevant timeframes. Here, bothmotions concern whether further injunctive relief prior to trial is appropriate.Accordingly, the motions will be discussed together. <P>(9) Although the court concludes in its discussion of the trade secrets claims,infra part II.C.3, that most of the Exhibit B works may no longer contain tradesecrets (assuming they ever did), this does not mean that, for the purposes ofcopyright protection, they are not unpublished. "Publication," as defined in 17U.S.C. section 101 requires that the cover consent to selling, leasing, loaning,giving away, or otherwise making available to the general public, the original orcopies of the work. 1 Nimmer section 4.04, at 4-17 to -19 & n.8. There is noevidence of any consensual release of any of these works to the public. <P>(10) The court is unpersuaded by the various alleged technical deficiencies,such as title discrepancies, in the copyright registrations. Errors, such asincorrectly naming the author, do not make the copyright invalid absent someevidence that the defendant was misled. 2 Nimmer section 7.20, at 7-201 to -207. <P>(11) The court will address the issue of direct infringement more fully in itsorder on the motions concerning defendants Netcom and Klemesrud. <P>(12) Even though fair use is an affirmative defense, Harper & Row, Publishers,Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 561 (1985), the court notes thatplaintiffs, as the parties moving for a preliminary injunction, have the burdenof proving a likelihood of success on their infringement claim, including thefair use defense. See 2 William Schwarzer et al., California Practice Guide:Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial 13:47 (1994) (citing Original AppalachianArtworks v. Topps Chewing Gum, 642 F.Supp. 1031, 1034 (N.D. Ga. 1986)). However,in determining whether plaintiffs have met their burden, the court recognizesthat fair use is an affirmative defense on which defendants will have the burdenof proof at trial. <P>(13) Erlich response that the documents that he posted "speak for themselves,"and thus little further commentary was necessary. The court will address thisdispute under the third statutory factor. <P>(14) Plaintiffs cite Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Maphia, 857 F.Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal.1994) for the proposition that there can be no fair use defense where thedefendant did not use an authorized copy to make his copies. In Sega, thedefendant, who had allegedly copied Sega videogame cartridges onto an electronicBBS where others could copy them, id. at 683, admitted that he did not own anycopies of Sega's game cartridges, id. at 687. Sega relies on language from AtariGames Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc., 975 F.2d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1992)stating that "[t]o invoke the fair use exception, an individual must possess anauthorized copy of a literary work." Atari, in turn, relies on Harper & Row'sdiscussion of the first statutory factor. In Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 563, theSupreme Court cited the trial court's finding that the defendant "knowingly"exploited a purloined manuscript" as weighing against a finding of fair use onthe first factor. Nothing in Harper & Row indicates that the defendants' badfaith was itself conclusive of the fair use question, or even of the firstfactor. After Campbell, it is clear that a finding of bad faith, or a finding onany one of the four factors, cannot be considered dispositive. Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1170-71, 1174 & n.18. Campbell cited Harper & Row's good faith discussionwithout comment, but noted that the defendant's use of the plaintiff's work,despite the plaintiff's explicit denial of permission, would not, in any case,constitute bad faith. Id. at 1174 n.18. Campbell, the Supreme Court's most recentpronouncement on fair use, thus hardly endorses the good faith requirement. See 3Nimmer section 13.05[B][3], at 13-205 n.298. Accordingly, the court will treatbad faith as merely one aspect of the first factor. <P>(15) The court is unpersuaded by plaintiffs' argument that an intermediate copymade for the purposes of posting or uploading work makes the subsequent copyunauthorized such that fair use is unavailable. Sega and Atari merely suggestthat fair use is unavailable where the defendant does not possess any authorizedcopy; not that the challenged copying cannot be made from a secondary copy. Whilethe extra copying may constitute infringement (for which there may or may not bea separate fair use defense), it should not affect the availability of the fairuse defense as to the critical or parodic use. <P>(16) Somewhat inconsistently, Erlich argues on the trade secret claim that manyof the Exhibit B works are "more prosaic than formulaic." Reply at 13. <P>(17) Erlich also argues that, even if he did copy most or all of many of theworks, he copied no more than was reasonable for his purposes. Erlich citesBelmore v. City Pages, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 673, 678-89 (D. Minn. 1995), in whichthe court found fair use where the defendant copies verbatim an entire shortarticle from a police newspaper for the purpose of criticism with addedcommentary constituting only about one fourth of the defendant's article. Thecourt found reasonable the alleged infringer's explanation that he copied theoriginal in its entirety because the original "took the form of a parable and wasrelatively short" and because he "decided that the repulsive message it appearedto convey could not be adequately communicated except by printing the story as awhole." Id. at 679. Erlich fails to mention that the Belmore court concluded thatthe third factor weighed in favor of the plaintiff; only a strong showing by thedefendant on the first and fourth factor overcame the fact that the defendant hadcopied the entire work. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Belmore, Erlich neveradequately explains why it was essential for him to copy verbatim the amount ofthe works that he copied, merely asserting in a conclusory fashion that it was"reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying." Further, Erlich's addedcriticism was far less substantial than the thirty-four lines of added commentaryin Belmore. The court is unconvinced that Erlich's wholesale copying of Hubbard'sworks with little or no commentary was necessary for his critical purposes. <P>(18) To the extent that courts look at how much of the allegedly infringing workis made up of copied material, see Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565-66, this factoralso weighs heavily against Erlich. Most of Erlich's postings constitute verbatimquotes from Hubbard's works, with occasional commentary such as "The perfectreference for any occasion," "I believe a discussion of this policy is in order.""Any questions?" and "Someone requested this, I assume, to discuss." Standingalone, these remarks are hardly criticism or commentary. <P>However, Erlich argues that the critical nature of Erlich's postings must beviewed in light of the extended nature of "threads" on newsgroups. A thread is anarticle on a particular topic, together with all the follow-up articles, and thefollow-ups to the follow-ups. Levine & Baroudi, supra note 5, at 399. While anentire thread might be considered one composite work authored by all those addingto the thread, there is no evidence in the record that any of Erlich's postingswere followed up with further comments or criticism on the works that areexcerpted. Erlich argues that it is common practice on the Internet to repeatlarge portions of a previous posting verbatim, which is necessary to add contextfor those who are late in joining a discussion. While this would perhaps justifythe copying of works that were previously posted by their authors on the basis ofan implied license or fair use agreement, see Maureen A. O'Rourke, "The Future ofCopyright and Contract Law in a Networked World," Federal Bar News & Journal(August 1994), these defenses would not apply where the first posting made anunauthorized copy of a copyrighted work. The court accepts, however, thepossibility that a particular quotation of a copyrighted work in the context of along thread that involves significant criticism or commentary could be fair use. <P>(19) To the extent that Erlich's postings suppress demand for the original worksby "persuad[ing] [potential buyers] that Hubbard was a charlatan" or that theChurch is a fraud, as clearly Erlich intends, such a "devastating critique" isnot "within the scope of copyright protection." New Era, 904 F.2d at 160(citation omitted); Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1178 (citing Fisher, 794 F.2d at 438).<P><P>(20) The court notes the difficulty of coming to this conclusion based on thelack of guidance in how to weigh the various factors. See Rubin v. Brooks/ColePublishing Co., 836 F. Supp. 909, 922 (D. Mass. 1993) (citing 3 Nimmer section13.05[A][5], at 13-199). <P>(21) The new Restatement provides a similar definition of a trade secret: <P>A trade secret is any information that can be used in the operation of abusiness or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret toafford an actual or potential economic advantage over others. <P>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition ("Restatement") section 39, at 425(1995). Although California has adopted the UTSA, courts also look to theRestatement to help interpret the UTSA. See Restatement section 39, cmt. b. at427; cf. 1 Milgrim section 1.01[1], at 1-3 (noting that UTSA jurisdictionsfrequently rely on the Restatement's definition of a trade secret). <P>(22) In granting summary judgment for the Church on its claim that a splintergroup had misappropriated the Advanced Technology works, the Southern District ofCalifornia did not address this preliminary question of whether religiousscriptures should be unprotectable as trade secrets because of theirnoncommercial, religious nature. Vien, 827 F. Supp. 629. Instead, the court foundthat the works were trade secrets because the Church had used reasonable steps tokeep the works secret and because they had independent economic value both toplaintiffs, who use the proceeds from the sale of these materials to support theoperation of the Church, and to the defendant, who was a competitor of the Churchwho also charged for Scientology-like courses. Id. at 633-34. <P>(23) Neither the Church's status as a religion nor its not-for-profit status areat issue in the current dispute. <P>(24) In a declaration that was prepared in Church of Scientology Int'l v.Fishman, No. 91-6426 HLH (Tx), Erlich cites to books and articles by formerScientologists on the lack of security measures accompanying the study of theAdvanced Technology materials. Erlich's Request for Judicial Notice, "BergerDecl.," Exs. 10, 22. This is clearly hearsay if offered to show the truth of thestatements that the security measures were inadequate. The court nonethelessnotes that the documents confirm that works were taken home in locked bags. Seeid., Ex. 10, at 30. <P>(25) The notion that the Church's trade secrets are disclosed to thousands ofparishioners makes this a rather unusual trade secrets case. However, becauseparishioners are required to maintain the secrecy of the materials, McShane May31, 1995 Decl. 3, the court sees no reason why the mere fact that many peoplehave seen the information should negate the information's trade secret status.See SmokEnders, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 318 (citing Chicago Board of Trade v. Christie G& S Co., 198 U.S. 236 (1905)) ("A trade secret owner does not lose his right bycommunicating the results to persons; even if many, in confidential relations toitself, under a contract not to make public.") While it is logically more likelythat a secret will leak out when more people are entrusted with it, absentevidence of leakage the court finds that giving out the secrets to a large numberof people, though no more than necessary, is not itself an unreasonable securitystep. <P>(26) Despite plaintiffs' argument to the contrary, these articles, several ofwhich have been separately authenticated by Erlich's counsel, are not hearsay asthey are being offered not for their truth but for the fact that they allegedlydisclose to the public RTC's trade secrets. <P>(27) Erlich further cites as relevant authority the Ninth Circuit's observationsin its unpublished opinion regarding the confidentiality of the AdvancedTechnology works. See Fishman, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 23848 (9th Cir. Aug. 30,1994). This court notes that the Ninth Circuit's Memorandum opinion is not to becited, except where relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, resjudicata, and collateral estoppel. Ninth Cir. Rule 36-3. It appears that none ofthe exceptions applies here. Further, the Ninth Circuit made no findings as tothe secrecy of the Advanced Technology works, but rather made "observations" thatthe district court might "wish to take into consideration" on remand. Id. at *8. <P>(28) There is no merit to Elrich's claim that the registration of the AdvancedTechnology works with the Copyright Office forfeited their trade secret status,as it appears that these works were registered in masked form. McShane May 31,1995 Decl., Ex. A. There is likewise no merit to Erlich's argument that the ClassVIII Assists lecture tape is not properly licensed to RTC and has not been keptconfidential. See McShane Depo. at 134, 140; Byrne Decl. 7-14. <P>(29) See Trotter Hardy, "The Proper Legal Regime for 'Cyberspace'," 55 U. Pitt.L. Rev. 993, 1055 n.45 (Summer 1994) (noting that "anonymous remailer" exists inFinland to allow anonymous or pseudonymous use of the Internet). <P>(30) See, e.g., McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 10. In another case involving some ofthe same Advanced Technology works, the court found misappropriation of tradesecrets where the works were stolen from a Church in Denmark and the defendant'scopies must have been connected to the stolen documents, thereby defeating thedefendant's argument that he had acquire the information through proper means.Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim, 228 U.S.P.Q. 534, 536-37 (C.D. Cal.1985), rev'd on other grounds, 796 F.2d 1076 (9th Cir. 1986). The present case isdistinguishable because there was no argument in Wollersheim that the defendantshad received the Church materials in a manner that would destroy their secrecy,i.e., over the Internet or by some other type of publication. <P>(31) Although Erlich does not specifically address the element ofmisappropriation, the court notes that RTC has shown that Erlich's disclosuresover the Internet of RTC's Exhibit B works, like that of the defendant in Vien,may constitute misappropriation. The fact that Erlich's postings were not of the"entire secret," and included only portions of courses, does not mean thatErlich's disclosures are not misappropriations. While previous partialdisclosures arguably made public only those parts disclosed, Erlich's partialdisclosures of non-public portions of the secrets may themselves be actionablebecause they constitute "disclosure . to know that his . . . knowledge of thetrade secret was . . . . [either] [d]erived from or through a person who hadutilized improper means to acquire it [or] [a]cquired under circumstances givingrise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use." UTSA section 3426.1(b).<P>Erlich argues that this case is distinguishable from Vien because in Vien thedefendant was "a competitor of plaintiffs' [sic], who used the AdvancedTechnology in the delivery of the courses for which she [was] paid" and for whichshe charged as much as $3000. Vien, 827 F. Supp. at 633-34 (emphasis added).Unlike the defendant in Vien, Erlich neither offers Scientology-like services norcharges anyone for the use of the materials. Additionally, Erlich seems to arguethat his activities are distinguishable from those of the defendants in Vien andWollersheim because he never profited from his use of the trade secrets and thushas not misappropriated the works. However, nothing in the UTSA requires that thedefendant gain any advantage from the disclosure; it is sufficient to show "use"by disclosure of a trade secret with actual or constructive knowledge that thesecret was acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain itssecrecy. UTSA section 3426.1(2); Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516, 523-24(9th Cir. 1990). Thus, Erlich's admitted posting of the information, regardlessof any alleged fair use defense or lack of financial motive may constitutemisappropriation of the Church's trade secrets. <P>(32) Although there is no evidence that Erlich "copied" item 9 of Exhibits A andB, the court is satisfied that plaintiffs have shown the document to beprotectable and of the same nature as other Exhibit A and B documents. Therefore,it is reasonable to include those documents in the injunction. <P>(33) This conclusion, however, is without prejudice to plaintiffs' filing arequest for leave to file a supplemental complaint that contains furtherallegations of infringement of copyright or to request that the preliminaryinjunction be expanded to cover works which were seized from Erlich and are nowbeing returned. The application would need to show that plaintiffs hold validcopyright interests in the documents. <P>(34) Exhibits A and B, and not Exhibits A-1 and B-1 to the FAC, are the subjectof the TRO and the Amended TRO. <P>(35) The writ of seizure provides in relevant part: <P>TO THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS: <P>Pursuant to the Order [of February 10, 1995 to Clerk To Issue Writ for Seizureof Articles Infringing Statutory Copyright], which commands me to issue this Writof Seizure. <P>YOU ARE DIRECTED to seize, using such force as may be reasonably necessary inthe premises, the following articles and things which you may then or otherwisethereafter find on the person, in the possession, or under the control ofdefendant Dennis Erlich ("Erlich") and/or defendant's agents and persons actingin concert with defendant, at [defendant's home address], or elsewhere wheredefendant Erlich or any such agents and persons may be found in the territory inwhich you may serve this Writ, including any building, annex or other structureadjacent to or on the premises identified above, to wit: any and all copies,reproductions, or embodiments of all or any part of the literary works identifiedon Exhibits A and B to the Complaint (copies of Exhibits A and B are attachedhereto), including any 3-1/2" or 5-1/4" computer disks and printed materials; allmasters and tapes; any articles and things that appear to be works of L. RonHubbard protected by copyrights; but excluding all personal computers (includingall ancillary equipment and disk drives, found at or within the above-describedlocations[)]. <P>February 10, 1995 Writ of Seizure (emphasis added). <P>(36) Although Erlich's use of plaintiffs' materials for what is arguablycriticism can hardly be analogized to the case of a professional counterfeiter,other considerations make this a good case for ex parte relief. Computer filescan be easily uploaded and copied from one location to another and are easy totransport, conceal, or delete. The ability of users to post large amounts ofprotected works nearly instantaneously over the Internet makes it a ratherdangerous haven for copyright infringers. <P>(37) Plaintiffs allege that Erlich has shown his propensity to conceal evidenceand lie by his concealment of the computer containing the infringing materials ina closet in a locked room during the February 13, 1995 seizure. This evidence,which Erlich disputes, is irrelevant to the question of what evidence presentedto the court prior to the issuance of the ex parte seizure order showed that thecourt should dispense with the usual notice requirement. See First Technology, 11F.3d at 651-52. <P>(38) The cases cited by plaintiffs for the proposition that a very broad seizureis justified are not on point. The extremely broad searches and seizures in those cases were justified because of the pervasiveness of the crime or fraud. <P>(39) The court is disturbed by the possibility that plaintiffs copied theentirety of Erlich's hard drive onto a tape for examination at their leisure. IfErlich did not, as he claims, consent to this part of the seizure, this wouldconstitute a significant intrusion into Erlich's private affairs that was notjustified by the need to identify infringing copies. But see McShane February 21,1995 Decl. Paragraph 7 (stating that Erlich consented to plaintiffs' reviewinghis floppy disks off the premises if the non-infringing disks were returned). Thecourt is also disturbed by allegations that plaintiffs deleted materials fromErlich's hard drive if such materials were not also saved on floppies or tapeback-up for possible later restoration. <P>(40) Erlich's additional arguments are mooted by the court's conclusion. Thecourt has already disposed of Erlich's argument that plaintiffs' failure to provelikelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm is an independent groundfor vacating the writ of seizure. Because the court has determined that the writof seizure should be vacated, there is no need to consider Erlich's request toincrease the amount of the bond. Erlich's request for the return of certainimproperly seized articles is also moot as all materials must be returned. <P>(41) The court notes that plaintiffs are not alone in placing new arguments intheir Reply--Erlich's Reply in support of his motion to dissolve the TROcontained several new arguments. The proper response to such new arguments,however, would be to object to the new arguments, not to endlessly continue thearguments back and forth. <P></font>><hr size=5> <P><a href="/spotlight/archive.html"><img width=72 height=69 border =0 align=center src="/images/lcc.gif" alt="COUNSEL CONNECT"> <I>Spotlight</I> <I>archives</i></a></body></html>

Introduction</h2><tt>	In this portion of our comments, we respond to the Agency's claims in itsAugust11, 1995 Proposed Rule (FDA Dkt.95N-0253), 60 Fed. Reg.41,314, et seq., and accompanying "Analysis Regarding theFood&amp; Drug Administration's Jurisdiction Over Nicotine-ContainingCigarettes" (FDA Dkt.95N-0253J), 60 Fed. Reg. 41,453, etseq., that it has jurisdiction over all nicotine-containingcigarettes as "drugs" and medical "devices," notwithstanding the undisputedfact that the manufacturers of those cigarettes do not make any claim that theyare intended for therapeutic use.  The FDA proposal and jurisdictional analysisleave no doubt that FDA has decided to assert jurisdiction over all nicotine-containingcigarettes on the basis of unprecedented legal theories and unsupported factualcontentions, which are contrary to prior congressional determinations,inconsistent with both judicial and administrative precedent, and plainly wrongas a matter of law and fact.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's unlawful assertion of jurisdiction is the subject of litigationagainst the Agency by a number of cigarette manufacturers and other parties inthe United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.Coyne Beahm, Inc., et al.v. FDA, C.A. File No. 2:95CV00591(filed Aug.10, 1995).  The commenters believe that that litigation, whichwas filed in August 1995, is the appropriate forum in which to resolve thethreshold issue whether Congress has withheld from FDA the authority toregulate cigarettes.  They have presented their legal arguments-- whichthey previously made to the Agency in their oppositions to the petitions filedby the Action for Smoking and Health and the Coalition on Smoking ORHealth-- to that Court.</tt><p><tt>	Nevertheless, to ensure that the Agency will not later argue that thecommenters have somehow failed in this rulemaking to make their arguments thatFDA lacks jurisdiction over cigarettes, the commenters are once again settingforth their legal position-- in essentially the same form it has beenpresented in motions now pending before the District Court in NorthCarolina.</tt><p><tt>	Specifically, in the following comments in this Volume, we demonstratethat:</tt><h3>1.		FDA's recent assertion of jurisdiction over all cigarettes is anunconstitutional usurpation of powers that Congress has reserved to itself.</h3><tt>	</tt><h3>2.		Even if, contrary to Congress's expressed intent, cigarettes could betreated like other products over which FDA might assert jurisdiction, FDA hasfailed to follow its own longstanding interpretation and judicial precedentestablishing that a product is a "drug" or "device" under the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), 21U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]321-395,based solely on its intended use as determined by the claims made by itsmanufacturer in connection with the sale of the product.</h3><tt>	</tt><h3>3.		In asserting jurisdiction over all nicotine-containingcigarettes, FDA has relied on a number of erroneous legal theories concerning"evidence" of "intended use," rather than claims made by the manufacturers, andhas ignored the "intended use" of each specific brand of cigarettes.</h3><tt>	</tt><p><tt>		Each of these propositions is sufficient, standing alone, to establishthat FDA does not have any jurisdiction over cigarettes as currently marketed.The administrative record contains no evidence, and FDA has never evencontended, that any of the manufacturers submitting these comments is makingtherapeutic claims for any of its cigarettes.</tt><h2>H.		FDA Has No Jurisdiction Over Any Currently</h2><tt>		<b>Marketed Brand of Cigarettes</></b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	For decades, Congress has determined that cigarettes marketed withoutclaims of therapeutic benefit are neither "drugs" nor "devices" subject to FDAjurisdiction.  Indeed, Congress has consistently determined that cigarettes arenot, and should not be, subject to FDA jurisdiction.</tt><p><tt>	Whether FDA has or should be accorded jurisdiction over cigarettes hasbeen placed squarely before Congress many times, and Congress has consistently(1)rejected all proposed legislation that would have given FDAjurisdiction over cigarettes; (2)relied on FDA's own statements that,under the FDCA, the Agency has no authority over cigarettes; and(3)instead provided that Congress itself, along with other federalagencies and the States acting pursuant to Congress's specific direction,should regulate cigarettes as part of a comprehensive program controlled byCongress itself-- a program that deliberately excludes any rolefor FDA.</tt><p><tt>	This congressional determination has been followed by the courts and priorFDA Commissioners.  Indeed, until November 1994, even Commissioner Kessleracknowledged that FDA would need congressional action before the Agency couldregulate cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	Despite this consistent legislative direction and Agency agreement thatcigarettes are not within FDA's jurisdiction, on August10, 1995, thePresident and FDA Commissioner Kessler announced that FDA was assertingjurisdiction over the nicotine in cigarettes as a "drug" and over cigarettesthemselves as medical "devices."  FDA's notice of proposed rulemaking waspublished in the <i>Federal Register</i> on August11, 1995.  60Fed.Reg. 41,314 (Aug.11, 1995).  In it, FDA asserts that cigarettemanufacturers intend their various brands of cigarettes to affect the structureor function of the human body, and thus all nicotine-containingcigarettes are subject to FDA's jurisdiction as medical devices under the FDCA,21U.S.C. [[section]]321(h)(3).</tt><p><tt>	In prior comments on the citizen petitions asking FDA to regulatecigarettes under the FDCA, Philip Morris, Reynolds, and Brown&amp;Williamson contended that only Congress, or those agencies or the Statesexpressly authorized by Congress, can regulate cigarettes; and that Congresshas reaffirmed, and FDA has acknowledged, that the Agency lacks jurisdiction toregulate cigarettes for which no therapeutic claims are made.</tt> [1  FDA has summarily rejected these contentions,with finality, as "devoid of any authority."  ]<tt><i>Nicotine InCigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products Is A Drug and These Products AreNicotine Delivery Devices Under The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,</i>Appendix6, A-168 to A-169.  See 60Fed. Reg.41,459.</tt><h3>1.	  Congress Has Withheld From FDA Any</h3><tt>			<b>Authority To Regulate Cigarettes</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The history of Congress's consideration --and rejection --of proposals to grant FDA authority to regulate cigarettes stretches back tothe early years of this century.  Before World WarI, the predecessor ofFDA, the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, acknowledgedthat tobacco products were beyond the scope of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906,Pub.L. No.59-384,34Stat. 768 (1906), unless they were labeled for a "medicinalpurpose":</tt><p><tt>"[T]obacco and its preparations, when labeled in such a manner as toindicate their use for the cure, mitigation, or prevention of disease, aredrugs within the meaning of the act, and, as such, are subject to theprovisions thereof.</tt><p><p><tt>"On the other hand, tobacco and its preparations which are not solabeled and are used for smoking or chewing or as snuff and not for medicinalpurposes are not subject to the provisions of the act."</tt><p><p><tt>Service and Regulatory Announcements, No.13 (1914) (emphasisadded).</tt><p><tt>	Not everyone agreed with the decision to exclude FDA's predecessor fromthe regulation of cigarettes.  In 1929, anti-tobaccoforces introduced legislation to bring tobacco products within the jurisdictionof the federal agency that enforced the nation's drug laws.  S.1468,71stCong., 1st Sess. (1929).  See<i> </i>also 71Cong.Rec.2586, 2589 (June10, 1929) (comments and bill introduced bySen.Smoot).  That bill-- like all those since that would have givenFDA jurisdiction over tobacco products-- did not pass.</tt><p><tt>	Congress's policy toward tobacco products did not change with theenactment of the FDCA in 1938.  From 1940 to 1952, FDA consistently assuredCongress that cigarettes were not "drugs" under that Act absent claimsby the manufacturer of some specific therapeutic benefit.  See Brief forGovernment Appellee (FDA) 22 n.19,<i> </i>Action on Smoking and Health(ASH)v. Harris, 655F.2d 236 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  Congresstook no issue with that understanding.</tt><p><tt>	In the 1950s and 1960s, the issue of smoking and health became a matter ofincreased scientific and political debate.  Not surprisingly, the question ofwhether FDA should be granted jurisdiction over cigarettes was again raised inCongress on several occasions.  Each time, Congress concluded that FDA did nothave, and should not be given, jurisdictionover cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	In 1956, a bill was introduced to amend the FDCA to grant FDA regulatoryauthority over cigarettes.  H.R.11280, 84th Cong., 2dSess. (1956).The bill did not pass.</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, in 1963, bills to grant FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes wereintroduced in both houses of Congress.  S.1682, 88th Cong.,1stSess. (1963); H.R.5973, 88th Cong., 1stSess. (1963).Again, the purpose of that legislation was to "place all smoking products underthe authority of the Food and Drug Administration."  109Cong. Rec.10,316, 10,317 (June6, 1963) (statement of Sen.Moss).  According totheir sponsors, the bills were introduced precisely because it was clear that"smoking products do not come under the protection of the FDA."  Id.at10,318.  Again, however, the bills did not pass.</tt><p><tt>	In 1963, FDA's Bureau of Enforcement circulated a letter setting forth theAgency's position on "the application of laws which we administer to thedistribution of tobacco-containingproducts."  Again, FDA acknowledged that it does not have jurisdiction overtobacco products sold "without accompanying therapeutic claims":</tt><p><tt>"The statutory basis for the exclusion of tobacco products from FDA'sjurisdiction is the fact that tobacco marketed for chewing or smokingwithout accompanying therapeutic claims, does not meet the definitions inthe Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for food, drug, device or cosmetic."</tt> [2<p>]<h3>2.		Congress Responded to the 1964 Surgeon</h3><tt><b>			General's Report by Creating a</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Comprehensive Program for Cigarette</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Regulation, Which Excludes Any Role for FDA</b></tt><p><p><tt>	In 1964, the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General published its nowfamous report concerning the risks associated with smoking.  U.S. Dept. ofHealth, Education, and Welfare ("HEW"), Smoking and Health:  Report of theAdvisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service(1964) (hereinafter "Surgeon General's Report 1964").  Congressconsidered the best manner in which to act on the report.  Once again, theissue of possible FDA regulation of cigarettes was raised, and legislation wasintroduced to grant FDA that authority.  H.R.2248, 89thCong., 1stSess. (1965).  Once again, both the proponents and opponents of such anextension of FDA jurisdiction recognized that the Agency has no such authorityunder the FDCA.  As both HEW and FDA testified, "The Food and DrugAdministration has no jurisdiction under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Actover tobacco, unless it bears drug claims."</tt> [3<p>	Again, Congress rejected the proposals to grant FDA jurisdiction overcigarettes.  Instead, Congress pursued a very different approach in the FederalCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 ("FCLAA").  Pub. L.No.89-92, 79 Stat. 282 (1965), codified at 15U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]1331-1341. As Congress clearly expressed, the FCLAA established "a]<tt>comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labelingand advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking andhealth...."  15U.S.C. [[section]]1331 (emphasisadded).  That program included no role for FDA.</tt><p><tt>	In enacting this comprehensive program, Congress reserved to itselfthe authority to regulate cigarettes, so as to balance three competinginterests:  maintaining the freedom of adults to smoke, informing the public ofthe risks associated with smoking, and preserving the significant economicinterests involved in the manufacturing and marketing of cigarettes.See Cipollonev. Liggett Group,<cite></cite>Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992).  As the House Committee on Interstateand Foreign Commerce observed:  "The determination of appropriate remedialaction in this area, as recommended by the Surgeon General's AdvisoryCommittee, is a responsibility which should be exercised by the Congress afterconsidering all facets of the problem."  H.R. Rep. No.449, 89th Cong.,1st Sess.3 (1965).</tt><p><tt>	Over the 30years since the enactment of the FCLAA, Congress hasextended its comprehensive program by enacting or amending other laws thatspecifically delegate some of Congress's authority to regulate cigarettes toagencies other than FDA.  For example:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS")reviews annual lists of cigarette ingredients and reports to Congress on anyperceived health effects, 15U.S.C. [[section]]1335a;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the Department of Agriculture sets production quotas andprice levels for tobacco leaf, 7U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]1281,et<i> </i>seq.;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms qualifies andregulates tobacco manufacturers, 26U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]5701, etseq.; and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the Internal Revenue Service taxes the sale of cigarettes,26U.S.C. [[section]]5701(b).</tt><p><p><tt>Congress has excluded FDA from these and all other regulatory programsconcerning cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	As part of this comprehensive regulatory program, Congress has directedthe Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")-- not FDA-- to administer thecongressional requirement that all cigarette packages and advertisements carryone of four specified warning labels-- labels that Congress itself hasauthored.  15U.S.C. [[section]]1333(a)(1).  Again, FDA has no rolein this regulation of cigarette labels and advertising even though the approvalof labeling for products within its jurisdiction is one of FDA's most importantpowers.  Indeed, Congress has prohibited any entity (including FDA) fromrequiring any labels or warnings with respect to cigarettes, other than thosethat Congress itself has specifically set forth in the FCLAA.  See15U.S.C. [[section]]1334(a) ("No statement relating to smoking andhealth, other than the statement required by section 4 of this Act [15 U.S.C.[[section]]1333], shall be required on any cigarette package").</tt><p><tt>	Congress has also regulated the advertising and use of cigarettes in otherspecific and concrete ways.  Congress has banned cigarette advertisements onradio and television.  15U.S.C. [[section]]1335.  As described ingreater detail below, Congress has ordered HHS to condition federal funding ofcertain programs on the adoption and enforcement by each state of specific lawsto restrict access to cigarettes by those under age.  42U.S.C.[[section]]300x-26.  Congress has prohibited smoking on airplane flights,49U.S.C. [[section]]41,706; in schools that receive federal funds,20U.S.C. [[section]]6083; and in clinics serving the Women, Infantsand Children Program, Pub.L.103-111,107Stat. 1072 (1993).  However, Congress has never given FDA any role informulating or enforcing any of these advertising, access, or userestrictions.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, as part of its comprehensive program, Congress has enacted anumber of statutes to keep itself and the public informed of the assertedhealth risks associated with smoking.  For example:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	HHS must submit an annual report to Congress on currentinformation about the health consequences of smoking and any recommendationsfor legislation, 15U.S.C. [[section]]1337(a);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	HHS must likewise transmit to Congress reports describingcurrent research findings made with respect to the asserted addictive propertyof tobacco and recommend any legislation or administrative action it deemsappropriate, 42U.S.C. [[section]]290aa-2(b);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	HHS must conduct, analyze and publish research on thereported health effects of smoking, 15U.S.C.[[section]]1341(a);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	The FTC must make an annual report to Congress aboutcigarette advertising, and recommend any legislation to further restrict suchadvertising, 15U.S.C. [[section]]1337(b); and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	The Interagency Committee on Fire Safety-- which didnot include any FDA member-- investigated and made recommendations onsteps to reduce the risks of cigarette fires, 15U.S.C.[[section]]2054.</tt><p><p><tt>Congress has never authorized FDA to participate in any of these researchor reporting activities.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, cigarettes are, and for many years have been, subject to adetailed and comprehensive regulatory program created by Congress andadministered by agencies other than FDA.  At the same time,Congress has decreed that these are to be the only federal restrictionson the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.  As one congressional report stated,with respect to proposed regulations not authorized by Congress,</tt><p><tt>"The regulations raise basic constitutional questions and would affect thegrowing, sale, and manufacturing of tobacco for cigarettes and the personsinvolved in or affected by those activities.  These activities cut across thewhole spectrum of commercial and social life in the United States.  It istherefore an area where the Congress, if anyone, must make policy."</tt><p><p><tt>H.R. Rep. No.289, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1969) (emphasisadded).</tt><p><tt>	FDA has now announced, in direct contravention of this clear congressionalmandate, that cigarettes are subject to the entirely different regulatoryregime of the FDCA-- a regime founded on the premise that a drug ormedical device cannot be marketed at all unless FDA is convincedthat it is "safe" in normal use.  Yet FDA has already announced that it wouldnever make such a finding with respect to cigarettes.  60Fed.Reg.41,349.  FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes is thus atwar with Congress's manifest determination, time and again, that,notwithstanding the alleged health risks of smoking-- which Congressitself has directed be recited on every pack and in every advertisement--cigarettes may still be sold without any FDA approval, regulation orrestriction.</tt><h3>3.		Over the Past 30 Years, Congress Has</h3><tt><b>			Continued To Deny FDA Jurisdiction Over</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Cigarettes; and FDA Has-- Until August,</b></tt><p><tt><b>			1995-- Accepted and Adhered to That</b></tt><p><tt><b>Decision&nbp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	During the 30 years since Congress enacted the FCLAA, there have beenrepeated proposals in Congress to grant FDA authority over cigarettes.Congress has consistently been reminded, often by FDA itself, that the Agencylacks such jurisdiction.  Yet, at every opportunity, Congress has rejectedproposals to change the law to grant FDA authority over tobaccoproducts.</tt><p><tt>	In 1972, FDA Commissioner Charles Edwards, M.D., acknowledged to Congressthat FDA does not have jurisdiction over cigarettes.  Commissioner Edwards wenton to emphasize that, in the Agency's view, any assertion of FDA jurisdictionwould inevitably lead to the outright prohibition of cigarettes-- aresult that would defy Congress's decision to permit cigarette sales with thecongressionally authored warnings:</tt><p><tt>"[C]igarettes recommended for smoking pleasure are beyond the FederalFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act....  Indeed, if cigarettes wereto be classified as drugs, they would have to be removed from the marketbecause it would be impossible to prove they were safe for their intendeduse.</tt><p><p><tt>"[T]he regulation of cigarettes is to be the domain ofCongress....  In sum, labeling or banning cigarettes is astepthat can be take[n] only by the Congress.  Any such move by FDAwould be inconsistent with the clear congressional intent."</tt><p><p><tt>1972 Hearings at239, 242 (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	The FDA Chief Counsel similarly testified at the 1972 hearings that</tt><p><tt>"Congress decided in 1970 [in amendments to the FCLAA] that cigarettesshould not be banned, that they should be allowed to remain in commerce withthe warnings decided on by Congress, and we therefore feel that we have nobasis for making any kind of determination literally contrary to thecongressional determination."  Id. at245.</tt><p><p><tt>	Shortly thereafter, the FDA Chief Counsel wrote to the same congressionalcommittee reporting on consultations he had had with Wilmot Hastings, thenGeneral Counsel of HEW, on "whether a test case might be brought to determinewhether FDA has jurisdiction over cigarettes."  Id. at 246 (quotingLetter from Peter Barton Hutt to Senator Frank E. Moss).  The FDA Counseladvised Congress that "Mr.Hastings and I believe that such a test casewould be without sound legal basis, and thus should not be instituted."Id.</tt><p><tt>	Not long after FDA Commissioner Edwards and the Agency's Chief Counsel haddeclared emphatically to Congress that FDA did not have jurisdictionover cigarettes, Congress confronted the possibility that the EnvironmentalProtection Agency ("EPA") or Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") mightattempt to regulate tobacco products.  Congress's response in each instanceremoves any doubt that Congress itself intends to establish with specificity inexpress language which restrictions on cigarettes are appropriate and whichagencies will be authorized to implement them.  The key events occurred in1976, the same year Congress enacted the Medical Device Amendments to theFDCA-- the law which FDA has now invoked to regulate cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	In 1976, Congress enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"),empowering EPA to regulate substances that might pose a threat to health.Congress included in TSCA's definition of "chemical substance" an exception for"tobacco or any tobacco product."  15U.S.C.[[section]]2602(2)(B)(iii).  Significantly, in the same section, Congressseparately excluded any "food...drug, cosmetic,or device," as defined in the FDCA.  15 U.S.C.[[section]]2602(2)(B)(vi) (emphasis added).  Of course, had Congressbelieved that tobacco products were subject to FDA regulation as drugs ordevices, this latter exception would have been sufficient to exclude them.Congress, however, having been repeatedly so advised by FDA, clearly understoodthat tobacco products were an entirely separate category, and, just as clearly,Congress did not want them judged by any agency by the criteria applicable todrugs, devices or other substances.</tt><p><tt>	In that same year, 1976, Congress responded to the suggestion that theCPSC might have some authority over tobacco products.  A federal district courthad ruled that the CPSC had jurisdiction to consider a petition to regulatecigarettes under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.  American PublicHealth Ass'nv. CPSC, C.A. No.74-1222(D.D.C. Apr.23, 1975), vacated as moot, No. 75-1863(D.C. Cir. June15, 1976).  Congress quickly amended the FHSA to excludetobacco products from the definition of "hazardous substance."  15U.S.C.[[section]]1261(f).  In doing so, Congress expressly reiterated itsintent that it alone would make policy with regard to tobaccoproducts:</tt><p><tt>"[T]he clear mandate of the Congress [is] that the basic regulation oftobacco and tobacco products is governed by the legislation dealing with thesubject, the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1969, and that anyfurther regulation in this sensitive and complex area must be reserved forspecific Congressional action."</tt><p><p><tt>S.Rep. No. 251, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.43 (1976) (emphasisadded).</tt><p><tt>	The import of these congressional actions and statements is unmistakable:Congress was not prepared to allow any federal agency to invoke its generaljurisdiction to regulate cigarettes.  Congress had, on a number of occasions,already been told, and had agreed, that FDA has no such authority.  It is notplausible-- indeed, it is preposterous-- to suggest that thesame Congress that expressly prohibited EPA and CPSC from regulatingcigarettes somehow, without ever mentioning cigarettes, authorized theirregulation under the Medical Device Amendments.</tt><p><tt>	The suggestion is even less plausible given that the Medical DeviceAmendments were designed to assure the safety of medical devices; and that theagency charged to administer these amendments-- FDA-- hadrepeatedly told Congress that it has no jurisdiction over cigarettes.  Indeed,as discussed below, FDA, itself, has flatly stated that nothing in thelegislative history of the Medical Device Amendments suggests any suchcongressional intent to grant FDA such authority.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, less than a year after the Medical Device amendments wereenacted, FDA promulgated a proposed regulation on saccharin.  42 Fed. Reg.19,996 (Apr.15, 1977).  In discussing certain studies of the healtheffects of saccharin, the Agency referred to "the risk of lung cancer fromcigarette smoking (which FDA has no authority toregulate)...."  Id. at 20,001 (emphasis added).Thus, even after the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments, FDA treatedits lack of jurisdiction over cigarettes as so clear and well established asnot requiring argument or explanation.</tt><p><tt>	That Congress has withheld jurisdiction over cigarettes from FDA wasconfirmed in 1977, 1978, and 1979, when anti-tobaccoCongressmen-- well aware that Congress had not granted FDAjurisdiction over cigarettes in the 1976 Medical Device Amendments--introduced five bills to grant FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products.</tt> [4  Again, every one of those bills failed topass.<p>	In 1984, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which had drafted theMedical Device Amendments of 1976, likewise observed that "Federal laws thatprotect the public from hazardous food, drugs and consumer products do notapply to cigarettes...."  H.R.Rep. No.805,98th Cong., 2d Sess.12 (1984).<p>	In 1987 and 1989, additional bills were introduced to expand FDA jurisdictionby creating a new regulatory category for tobacco products.  H.R.3294,100thCong., 1st Sess. (1987); H.R.1494 and S.769, 101stCong., 1st Sess. (1989).  Again, none of these bills was enacted.<p>	In 1989, FDA Commissioner Frank Young, M.D., and the Agency's Chief Counseltestified together before Congress on whether FDA could regulate tobaccoproducts under the FDCA.  Like his predecessors who had testified on thatissue, Commissioner Young acknowledged that "it doesn't look like it ispossible to regulate [tobacco] under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act."]<tt>Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Rural Development, Agriculture, andRelated Agencies, of the House Comm. on Appropriations, Part8, 100thCong., 2d Sess. 409 (1989).</tt><p><tt>	Even as staunch an anti-smokingadvocate as Rep.Richard Durbin conceded that Congress's exclusion oftobacco products from the reach of FDA was beyond question:</tt><p><tt>"It would seem that if you looked at the spectrum of products sold inAmerica, [tobacco] stands out as an extraordinary exception to your mandateunder the FDA [sic] ....</tt><p><p><tt>"...There have been tests over the years in court as towhether or not tobacco is included in the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, and thecourts have concluded it is not.  In fact, I think they have concludedunanimously that it is not an ingested food, nor is it a drug, taken for anillness or to change some type of body structure."  Id. at408(emphasis added).</tt>[5<p><p>	During the past few years, the attempts by anti-tobaccoforces to convince Congress to grant FDA some role in regulating cigaretteshave continued; and all have been rejected.  In 1992, H.R.4350 andS.2298 were introduced to expand FDA jurisdiction by creating a newregulatory category for tobacco products.  In connection with that legislation,Rep.Michael Synar, a leading opponent of tobacco, stated that, "While theFDA has jurisdiction to protect consumers from unsafe foods, drugs, cosmeticsand medical devices, ]<tt>it is powerless to do anything about oneof the deadliest consumer products-- tobacco."  138Cong.Rec.E483 (Feb.27, 1992) (emphasis added).  The bills to change thatpolicy, however, did not pass.</tt><p><tt>	In 1993, H.R.2147 and S.672 were introduced to expand FDAjurisdiction by creating a new regulatory category for tobacco products.Again, however, Congress said "no".</tt><p><tt>	In sum, the question whether FDA should be given authority to regulatecigarettes has been presented to Congress many times, and every timeCongress has rejected efforts to grant FDA such jurisdiction.</tt> [6  And throughout its history, FDA, itself, hassquarely and repeatedly acknowledged that it has no jurisdiction over tobaccoproducts.]<h3>4.		The Courts Have Consistently Recognized</h3><tt>			<b>That FDA Has No Jurisdiction Over Cigarettes</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	For more than 40years, the courts, too, have consistentlyheld that FDA cannot regulate cigarettes sold for smoking pleasure.  They havedone so even in cases in which the proponents of FDA jurisdiction overcigarettes argued that the requisite "intended use" as a "drug" or "device"could be divined-- as FDA now asserts-- from the manner in whichcigarettes allegedly are manufactured or used.</tt><p><tt>	In FTCv. Liggett&amp; Myers Tobacco Co.,108F.Supp. 573 (S.D.N.Y. 1952), aff'd<i> </i>on<i></i>opinion<i> </i>below, 203F.2d 955 (2d Cir. 1953) (percuriam), the court construed the definition of "drug" in the Federal TradeCommission Act, a term which is, in all respects relevant to "intended use",identical to the definitions of both "drug" and "device" in the FDCA.  Thecourt directly considered the argument-- now recycled by FDA-- thatnicotine makes cigarettes a "drug" because it "affects the functions of thebody."  In language just as telling today as it was then, the court rejectedthat contention as a matter of law:</tt><p><tt>"Anything which stimulates any of the senses may be said, in some perhapsinsignificant degree, to affect the functions of the body of man.  Consequentlyany article which, used in the manner anticipated by the manufacturer thereof,comes into contact with any of the senses may be said to be an article`intended to affect the functions of the body of man.'...  -Surely,the legislators did not mean to be as all-inclusiveas a literal interpretation of this clause would compel us to be."108F.Supp. at576.</tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has never disagreed with this ruling.  Indeed, FDA has repeatedlyassured Congress that the Agency has no authority whatever overcigarettes unless the manufacturer made some therapeutic claim.  The courtsrepeatedly have agreed with that firm line of demarcation.</tt><p><tt>	On two occasions, in the 1950s, FDA challenged the promotional claims madefor specific brands of cigarettes-- therapeutic claims made by themanufacturers-- arguing that those claims caused the cigarettes tobecome "drugs" under the FDCA.  Leaflets for one brand, Fairfax cigarettes,promoted it as effective in preventing the "common cold, influenza,pneumonia,... scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles,meningitis, tuberculosis... [and] parrot fever."  UnitedStatesv. 46 Cartons, More or Less, Containing FairfaxCigarettes, 113F.Supp. 336, 337 (D.N.J. 1953).  In upholdingFDA's complaint against that one brand, the court framed the appropriatequestion:  "whether the public, having in mind the specious statements of theleaflets, would buy Fairfax cigarettes primarily for smoking enjoyment orwith the hope of mitigating, curing or preventing disease."  Id.at338 (emphasis added).  The court cited the authoritative legislativehistory of the FDCA, which states that "[t]he manufacturer of the article,through his representations in connection with its sale, can determine theuse to which the article is to be put."  Id. (quoting S.Rep.No.361, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.4 (1935)) (emphasis added).  Thus, thecourt sustained FDA's view that because of the express, unequivocallytherapeutic claims made by the manufacturer, Fairfax cigarettes were "drugs"under the FDCA.  The court did not announce a rule of law confirming FDAjurisdiction to regulate cigarettes.  It did not even declare that FDA couldapply its general requirements to the particular Fairfax brand of cigarettes.It held only that, given the promotional claims, the product at issue (Fairfaxcigarettes) met the statutory definition of "drug."</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, in United Statesv. 354 BulkCartons... Trim Reducing-AidCigarettes, 178F.Supp. 847 (D.N.J. 1959), the manufacturer hadclaimed that its particular brand was effective for weight reduction.  Themanufacturer had stated on every pack that the Trim cigarettes were "reducingaid cigarettes" and should be used with the following "directions":</tt><p><tt>"Smoke one cigarette shortly before meals... and wheneveryou are tempted to reach for a late evening snack.  Trim reducing-aidcigarettes contain a patented appetite satient that takes the edge off yourappetite.  Clinically tested...."  Id.at849.</tt><p><p><tt>	The same promises of clinical results were reinforced through displaycards, circulars, and "point-of-sale"materials.  Id.  All made express claims of "scientific," "guaranteed"weight reduction through the "patented" ingredient added to the Trimcigarettes.  Significantly, the manufacturer had told potential customers thatthe special Trim "reducing-aid"cigarettes were "not intended to replace the purchaser's favoritecigarettes" smoked for mere pleasure.  Id.  Confronted with suchexplicit evidence of medical claims-- and the manufacturer'sconcession "that its product is intended to affect the structure andfunctions of the human body by reducing the appetite"-- FDA initiatedlegal action on the ground that the Trim brand was a "drug" under the FDCA.Id. at851.  The court agreed.</tt><p><tt>	These two cases stand for the narrow proposition that if the seller of aproduct-- any product-- not otherwise within FDA'sjurisdiction claims that it has a therapeutic use, that product may fall underthe drug provisions of the FDCA.  The involvement of cigarettes in these caseswas merely incidental to the court's holdings.  The cases are about the legalconsequences of a manufacturer making therapeutic claims.</tt><p><tt>	Neither case suggests that cigarettes could be "drugs" under the FDCA inthe absence of specific therapeutic claims.  Nor do the cases establish thatFDA has general authority to "regulate" cigarettes even when such claims havebeen made.  Indeed, neither case resulted in FDA "regulation" of anycigarettes.  The sole purpose --and only effect --of these two enforcement actions was to put a stop to the express therapeuticclaims made for those two particular products.</tt><p><tt>	At no time before these two seizure cases, nor during nearly two decadesthereafter, did anyone even try to persuade FDA to assert jurisdiction overcigarettes sold without therapeutic claims.</tt><p><tt>	In 1977, an anti-tobacco group, Action on Smoking and Health ("ASH"),filed a petition that argued FDA should assert jurisdiction over cigarettes onthe specific ground that all cigarettes contain nicotine, which produces a"physical addiction" in many smokers.  Petition to FDA, FDADkt.77P-0185 (May26, 1977).  It is noteworthy that the veryarguments FDA has now invoked as its purported "basis" for assertingjurisdiction over all cigarettes were presented to, and rejected by, FDA asa matter of law in its ruling on the ASH petition.</tt><p><tt>	Specifically, ASH contended in 1977 -- in statements virtually identical to the "evidence" FDA claims to haverecently "discovered"-- that</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	a cigarette is a drug, and/or that nicotine is a drug (p.2);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	cigarettes affect the structure and function of the body(pp. 2, 7);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"studies have demonstrated that many smokers smoke largelyfor the physiological effects the drug causes on their body" (p. 2);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"[n]umerous medical and other studies treat nicotine as adrug no different in many of its effects than heroin and other addictivesubstances" (p. 2);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"90% of all adult smokers would like to quitsmoking;... 60% have made one or more serious butunsuccessful efforts to do so;... many people are unable tostop smoking even though faced with certain death, amputation,etc.;... and others are willing to pay hundreds of dollarsfor smoking-withdrawalclinics and devices to help them stop" (p.2);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	there "is overwhelmingly persuasive evidence thatcigarettes are `intended to affect the functions of the body' by many users aswell as by the manufacturers" (p.2);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"[n]icotine is an extremely powerful substance exertingpowerful effects-- both immediate and temporary, as well as long-lasting--on the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, the heart, lungs andvarious other bodily structures" (p.6);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"[s]tudies going back at least to 1940, and others justrecently reported [in 1977] indicate that for many smokers the act of smokingis merely a convenient and socially accepted manner of administering a carefully-controlleddose of nicotine to the body...." (pp. 7-8);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"[s]mokers not only smoke to achieve the desired effectupon their bodily functions; their bodies (structure and functions) have sochanged in response to the effects of the drug that many cannot do without it,even if it means their certain death, dismemberment, etc." (p. 8);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"even when smokers themselves think that they are smokingto relieve stress, they are in fact responding to the effects of the drugnicotine and its withdrawal symptoms in regulating their smoking behavior so asto self-administerthe most satisfying dose of nicotine" (p. 8);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	[a] "cigarette is, after all, an instrument, apparatus, orcontrivance designed to administer controlled amounts of nicotine and othersubstances to the smoker upon demand" (p. 31); and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	"most children have no trouble acquiring the product fromvending machines or from unregulated sellers who wink at the legalrestrictions" (p.36).</tt><p><p><tt>	Though it did not take issue with any of these factual assertions,FDA, after full consideration and in a detailed opinion, categorically rejectedthe ASH petition.  The Agency recognized that such allegations, even iftrue, do not provide a basis for FDA jurisdiction as a matter oflaw.  </tt><p><tt>	In denying the ASH petition, FDA stated that the "interpretation of the[FDCA] by FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drug unlesshealth claims are made by the vendors."  Letter from Commissioner DonaldKennedy to JohnF. Banzhaf, III (Dec.5, 1977) at3 (emphasisadded).  FDA thus reaffirmed that the focus of any inquiry concerning the"intended use" of a product under the FDCA must be on therapeutic claimsactually made-- or, more accurately, the absence of suchclaims-- by the manufacturers:</tt><p><tt>"The petitioners have presented no evidence that manufacturers or vendorsof cigarettes represent that the cigarettes are `intended to affect thestructure or any function of the body of man....'Statements by the petitioners and citations in the petition that cigarettesare used by smokers to affect the structure or any functions of their bodiesare not evidence of such intent by the manufacturers or vendors ofcigarettes... ."  Id. at4 (citation omitted)(emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>Thus, FDA's position was not that the information presented by ASH as tohow smokers actually use cigarettes and the nicotine in them was insufficientto establish the intended use of cigarettes.  Rather, FDA's officialinterpretation of the FDCA was that such information was "not evidence of"intended use at all.  FDA has never disavowed that interpretation of the FDCAor found it incorrect.</tt><p><tt>	When ASH sought judicial review, FDA successfully defended its conclusionthat it lacked jurisdiction.  In 1979, in its brief on behalf of FDA, thegovernment declared that,</tt><p><tt>"In the 73 [now almost 90] years since the enactment of the original Foodand Drug Act, and in the 41 [now 58] years since the promulgation of the modernFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has repeatedly informed Congress thatcigarettes are beyond the scope of the statute absent health claimsestablishing a therapeutic intent on behalf of the manufacturer orvendor."</tt> [7<p><p>	Both the district court and the court of appeals agreed.  Quoting thedispositive passage in the legislative history of the FDCA, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit emphasized the settled view that themanufacturer's "representations in connection with [a product's] sale" arecontrolling:<p>"[T]he crux of FDA jurisdiction [lies] in manufacturers' representations asrevelatory of their intent.  `]<tt>The manufacturer of the article,through his representations in connection with its sale, can determine the useto which the article is to be put.'  Such an understanding has now beenaccepted as a matter of statutory interpretation."</tt><p><p><tt>ASHv. Harris, 655F.2d 236, 238-39 (D.C. Cir.1980) (citation and parentheticals omitted) (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	The D.C. Circuit likewise expressly endorsed the ruling inLiggett&amp; Meyers that the fact that nicotine has certainpharmacological effects is not a basis for FDA jurisdiction.  Id.at240.  In an admonition fully applicable today, the court concluded that"if the [FDCA] requires expansion [to cover cigarettes], that is the job ofCongress."  Id. at243 (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	Before the court of appeals issued its ruling, ASH filed a second petitionwith FDA.  This time, ASH argued that all filtered cigarettes were intended tomitigate or prevent disease and thus were medical "devices" under FDA'sjurisdiction.  Petition to FDA, FDA Dkt. 78P-0338 (Oct.2, 1978).ASH conceded that "a manufacturer's advertising claims are such powerfulevidence of `intended use' that those claims will be conclusive on thepoint...," but it nevertheless argued thattherapeutic claims could be imputed on the basis of users' intent.Id. at8 (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	FDA denied ASH's "device" petition because the type of "intent" ASHsought to impute was, as a matter of law, not a basis for FDAjurisdiction:</tt><p><tt>"Representations in cigarette labeling or advertising...as to the absolute or relative quantity of hazardous constituents of cigarettesmoke or as to the safety of the cigarettes do not make the cigarettes or theirfilters intended for use in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention ofdisease."</tt><p><p><tt>Letter from Mark Novitch to John Banzhaf and Peter Georgiades(Nov.25, 1980) at8.</tt><p><tt>	FDA further reiterated that cigarettes marketed for smoking pleasure arenot within FDA's jurisdiction under the FDCA.  Of particular importancefor the present proceeding, FDA thoroughly reviewed the legislative history ofthe 1976 Medical Device Amendments and found no warrant for FDA regulation ofcigarettes under their provisions:</tt><p><tt>"[T]here is no evidence in the legislative history that Congress intendedto include cigarettes within the definition of `device' nor does thelegislative history contain any discussion of a possibility that cigaretteswere 'devices' within the prior definition.</tt><p><p><tt>"The amendments were thoroughly considered, and the legislative historydiscusses the types of products intended to be regulated and the types ofhealth hazards with respect to which the amendments were intended to provideauthority.  Cigarettes are not mentioned even though Congress was aware of theconsiderable public discussion of the health hazards of cigarette smoking."Id. at 3.</tt><p><p><tt>	Based on this detailed review of the relevant legislative history, FDAconcluded, in unusually strong language, that "[i]t is, therefore, notreasonable to consider cigarettes as 'devices' when there was no discussionin the legislative history of congressional intent to provide jurisdiction overcigarettes or to provide authority suitable to the regulation of cigarettes."Id. (emphasis added).  FDA concluded:  "Insofar as rulemaking wouldrelate to cigarettes or attached filters as customarily marketed, we haveconcluded that FDA has no jurisdiction under [the FDCA].  Therefore,no rulemaking is permissible as a matter of law."  Id. at12(emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	ASH, by then aware of the D.C. Circuit's decision adverse to its positionin the earlier ASHv. Harris case-- including thecourt's conclusion that any extension of FDA jurisdiction to cigarettes wouldhave to be "the job of Congress"-- did not even seek judicial review ofFDA's denial of its "device" petition.</tt><p><tt>	No court since then has questioned FDA's unequivocal determination that itlacks jurisdiction over cigarettes as either "drugs" or "devices."  Until a fewmonths ago, FDA, itself, on every relevant occasion, forthrightly acknowledgedthat it has no authority to regulate cigarettes, with the caveat that thecigarette manufactureres (like the sellers of any other product not within FDAjurisdiction) must not make therapeutic claims.  Most importantly, Congressunderstood FDA's repeated statements as correctly reflecting congressionalintent; and Congress repeatedly rejected all proposals to grant FDA suchjurisdiction, and on many occasions amended the FDCA (including its drug anddevice provisions) without legislatively changing FDA's interpretation.</tt><p><tt>	In the current rulemaking, FDA does not acknowledge, much less attempt toexplain away, this history.  Its failure (or refusal) to do so demonstrates byitself that FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over all cigarettes is arbitraryand capricious.</tt><h3>5.		By Asserting Jurisdiction Over</h3><tt>			<b>Cigarettes, FDA Has Defied Congress</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	On February25, 1994, Commissioner Kessler for the first time statedthat FDA would reconsider whether the Agency should attempt to assertjurisdiction over cigarettes as "drugs."  Letter from David Kessler to ScottBallin (Feb.25, 1994).  Even then, however, he recognized that Congresswould need to act before FDA could extend its regulatory reach in thatmanner:</tt><p><tt>"We recognize that the regulation of cigarettes raises societal issues ofgreat complexity and magnitude.  It is vital in this context that Congressprovide clear direction to the agency.  We intend therefore to work withCongress to resolve, once and for all, the regulatory status of cigarettesunder the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  Id. at3.</tt><p><p><tt>	Shortly thereafter, ASH filed yet another petition, Petition toFDA, FDA Dkt. 94P-0077(Mar.4, 1994), this time asking the Agency to initiate this rulemaking todetermine FDA jurisdiction over all cigarettes notwithstanding the absence ofany therapeutic claims by their manufacturers.  As noted above, Philip Morris,Reynolds and Brown&amp; Williamson each opposed that petition, detailingthe legislative, judicial and administrative precedents squarely opposed to anysuch assertion of FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products.</tt><p><tt>	In congressional testimony in the spring of 1994, even after the ASHpetition had been filed, Commissioner Kessler once again conceded the need forsuch new "direction" from Congress.  Although suggesting that he had "evidence"that was causing him to "reconsider" FDA's prior recognition that the Agencydid not have jurisdiction over cigarettes, Commissioner Kessler testified thatthe Agency was seeking "guidance from the Congress on the public health andsocial issues that arise once the question [of whether cigarettes should beregulated by FDA] is posed."</tt>[8  Congress,however, has not enacted any new legislation directing (or even authorizing)FDA to regulate any tobacco product.<p>	The Agency's professed interest in working with Congress on tobacco issuesapparently disappeared with the 1994 elections.  On November10,1994-- one day after it was clear there would be a change in politicalcontrol of Congress-- FDA for the first time stated that the decision onwhether to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products was "a decision FDA willmake."  Letter from DianeE. Thompson, FDA Assoc. Comm'r for LegislativeAffairs, to Hon.H.MartinLancaster (Nov.10, 1994) at2.<p>	Since the summer of 1994, neither Commissioner Kessler nor any other Agencyrepresentative has testified before any congressional committee on possible FDAjurisdiction over cigarettes, proposed any legislation to extend FDA'sauthority in that manner, or otherwise consulted with the new congressionalleadership on tobacco issues.  The subcommittee that heard CommissionerKessler's testimony in 1994 never even issued a report on the matter, and didnot propose any legislation evidencing that Congress now intends FDA toregulate cigarettes.9  No such legislation has been recommended by anycongressional committee.  Nor has the Clinton Administration proposed anylegislation either to authorize FDA to regulate cigarettes or to deal with any"youth smoking" issues.<p>	In June 1995, ASH wrote to FDA threatening to sue the Agency if its petitionto institute this rulemaking was not granted by August15, 1995.  OnAugust10, 1995, without any further direction or authorization fromCongress, FDA declared that it has plenary jurisdiction over all cigarettes asmedical "devices" on the ground that they "deliver" the "drug" nicotine.  Inits rulemaking published in the Federal Register on August11, 1995, FDAspecifically rejected arguments that Congress had precluded FDA jurisdictionover cigarettes.  Appendix6 to "Jurisdictional Analysis" at A-168(rejecting comments filed in FDA Dkt. No. 94P-0077).<p>	Further, the proposed regulations the Agency announced would severely restrictcigarette sales, advertising and promotion in a number of ways that do notcomport with FDA's statutory authority over even true "drugs" and "devices."Indeed, Commissioner Kessler himself has admitted that FDA is ill-equippedto regulate cigarettes and is not capable of addressing the "societal issues"that arise from such regulation.  Letter from David Kessler to Scott Ballin(Feb.25, 1994) at 3.  With respect to tobacco products, he has concededthat FDA's "tools are limited."  ]<tt>Regulation of Tobacco Products:Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm. onEnergy and Commerce, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 68 (Mar. 25, 1994).</tt><p><tt>	This admission is not new.  Fifteen years earlier, another FDACommissioner recognized the Agency's lack of "suitable" authority forregulating cigarettes.  Letter from Mark Novitch to John Banzhaf and PeterGeorgiades (Nov.25, 1980) at3.  This is not surprising, however,because Congress never intended FDA to regulate cigarettes atall.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's defiance of Congress is not limited to the fact that it hasundertaken to regulate cigarettes despite repeated FDA statements to Congressthat the Agency has no such jurisdiction, repeated refusals by Congress toenact bills to grant such jurisdiction, and numerous amendments to the FDCA(including its drug and device provisions) that do not legislatively overruleFDA's interpretation.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA seeks to justify its assertion of jurisdiction as necessary to aregulatory program to address youth smoking.  Congress, however, has alreadyaddressed that issue; and it has created, by recent and specific legislation, aprogram to deal with it.  That program is radically different from FDA'sproposed regulations.  FDA's rationale for its unauthorized assertion ofjurisdiction is in further defiance of Congress's decision to deal with theissue of youth smoking by means not involving regulation by FDA.  Thus, FDA'sregulatory proposals to deal with youth smoking constitute a direct challengeto Congress's role as the chief policy-makerfor the nation.</tt><p><tt>	Most notably, in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments("ADAMHA") Reorganization Act of 1992, 42U.S.C. [[section]]300x-26,Congress determined that restricting youth access to tobacco products is a taskbest addressed at the State level.  Congress therefore conditioned certainfederal grants on the enactment and enforcement of State lawsprohibiting tobacco sales to minors.</tt><p><tt>	Pursuant to Congress's direction in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, theDepartment of Health and Human Services has proposed a "model" state law toreduce minors' access to tobacco products.  58Fed. Reg.45,156(1993).  That model law includes provisions which: </tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	license all cigarette retailers (section 3(c));</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	require signs at all points of sale warning that sales tominors are illegal (sections 3(d) and 4);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	ban the use of cigarette vending machines (section5(b));</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	prohibit retailers from selling tobacco products to anyonewithout appropriate proof of age (section 5(a)(2));</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	ban the sale of single cigarettes (section 5(a)(3)prohibits sale or distribution of tobacco products "in any form other than anoriginal factory-wrapped package");</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	establish a graduated schedule of penalties for anyviolations (section 7); and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	place responsibility for investigation and enforcement ina designated State agency (sections 3(a) and 3(b).</tt><p><p><tt>Id. at45,165-66.</tt><p><tt>	Although some of FDA's proposed restrictions track these provisions of themodel law, there is a critical difference:  Consistent with Congress's expressdirection, HHS has provided "that governors and States should have maximumflexibility to devise their own solutions."  58Fed. Reg. 45,161.  Otherthan a few congressionally-mandatedrequisites, HHS did "not propose specifying the provisions of the States'laws."  Id. at 45,156.  Rather, HHS noted "that States remain free todevise any enforcement approaches that they find cost effective."  Id.at 45,160.</tt><p><tt>	By contrast, FDA's requirements, restrictions and prohibitions wouldsimply be imposed on the States.  Thus, FDA's unilateral federal command-and-controlapproach to an issue that historically has been a responsibility of the Statesdiffers significantly from the approach formally adopted by Congress inlegislation.  Whereas the policy of Congress on the issue of youth smoking isto respect the historical role of the States by leaving the principalenforcement role to them, FDA proposes to arrogate that role to itself.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the regulation of tobacco advertising-- the other centralfeature of FDA's plan-- is already the responsibility of the FTC, asCongress expressly provided in the FCLAA.  15U.S.C.[[section]]1337.  In the same way, the Department of Justice enforcesCongress's ban on broadcast advertising of tobacco products.  15U.S.C.[[section]]1339.  Congress has repeatedly rejected proposals that wouldgive any authority to FDA to regulate tobacco advertising.</tt><p><tt>	In addition to rejecting any general FDA role in regulating cigaretteadvertising, Congress has also rejected most of the specificrestrictions FDA has proposed.  Most notably, in 1990, Representative HenryWaxman and other anti-tobaccoCongressmen introduced legislation which would have made it a federal offenseto sponsor sporting events using cigarette brand names, distribute freesamples, or advertise in anything other than a black-and-white"tombstone" format.  H.R. 5041, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990).  Thatlegislation, however, was rejected by Representative Waxman's own subcommitteeand was never enacted.  FDA is thus proposing to mandate specific restrictionsand prohibitions on cigarette sales and promotions which Congress flatlyrejected only a few years ago.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, Congress has enacted a comprehensive program to regulatecigarettes-- a program from which FDA has unequivocally been excluded.The existence of the specific provisions of this program-- includingprovisions that embody Congress's policy for dealing with the issue of youthsmoking-- confirm the absence of such authority under the FDCA.  As onecourt recently held, "It is a basic principle of statutory construction thatwhen two statutes are in conflict, a specific statute closely applicable tothe substance of the controversy at hand controls over a more generalizedprovision."  Farmerv. Employment Sec. Comm'n of NorthCarolina, 4F.3d 1274, 1284 (4th Cir. 1993) (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	In its cigarette rulemaking, FDA relies on general definitional languageto repudiate precise statutory language in a law that was passed for thespecific purpose of regulating tobacco (the FCLAA) and a law that was passedfor the specific purpose of addressing the issue of youth smoking (the ADAMHAReorganization Act).  Congress has enacted legislation specifically designed toregulate cigarettes-- not once, but several times.  Congress enacted theFCLAA with the express purpose of establishing a "comprehensive Federal programto deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to anyrelationship between smoking and health."  15U.S.C.[[section]]1331.  Similarly, in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, Congresshas determined that restricting sales to minors is a task best left to theStates, working with federal incentives.  These specific statutes, which createan explicit regulatory framework for cigarettes, control over the generalprovisions of the Medical Device Amendments, which never once mentioncigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	Congress's comprehensive program establishes federal policy respectingcigarette labeling, advertising and promotion; youth smoking; and publiceducation about smoking and health.  That policy advances and balancesimportant, competing interests.  FDA's assertion of jurisdiction unlawfullyintrudes into these areas and unlawfully substitutes a radically differentregime in place of the reconciliation of interests Congress has alreadymade.</tt><h3>6.		FDA's Assertion of Authority Cannot</h3><tt><b>			Be Reconciled With Congress's Decision</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>That Cigarettes May BeSold</b></t><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The conflict between FDA's assertion of plenary jurisdiction overcigarettes and Congress's specific, carefully structured program for theregulation of cigarettes is more than sufficient to demonstrate that FDA istrespassing into an area Congress has reserved to itself, to other federalagencies, and to the States.  However, FDA has done more:  the Agency has nowasserted that it possesses the authority not only to change radically thiscarefully crafted congressional scheme, but also to render it meaningless bybanning the sale of cigarettes entirely.  60Fed.Reg.41,523-24.</tt><p><tt>	It simply defies logic to believe that Congress-- which has rejectedproposal after proposal to grant FDA such jurisdiction, and has so carefullyestablished its own program to achieve a balance with respect to smoking,public health issues, the individual's freedom to smoke, and the economics ofan entire industry-- intended to repose in an agency that has had noprior role in this area the authority to ban cigarette sales entirely.  InFDA's view, Congress, without ever saying so, gave FDA the authority tooverturn in one stroke all of the carefully balanced legislation relating tocigarettes that Congress has enacted since 1965.</tt><p><tt>	Prior FDA Commissioners have candidly recognized the enormity of such acontention.  Commissioner Edwards testified to Congress in 1972, "[I]fcigarettes were to be classified as drugs, they would have to be removedfrom the market because it would be impossible to prove they were safe fortheir intended us[e]."  1972 Hearings at239 (emphasisadded).</tt><p><tt>	Commissioner Kessler previously agreed.  He stated in February1994:</tt><p><tt>"A strict application of [the drug provisions of the FDCA] could mean,ultimately, removal from the market of tobacco products containing nicotineat levels that cause or satisfy addiction.  Only those tobacco products fromwhich the nicotine had been removed or, possibly, tobacco products approved byFDA for nicotine-replacementtherapy would then remain on the market."</tt><p><p><tt>Letter from David Kessler to Scott Ballin (Feb.25, 1994) at3(emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, at a 1994 congressional hearing, Commissioner Kesslerconceded:</tt><p><tt>"There are those at the agency, I musttell you, Congressman, thathave a hard time believing that an Agency thatis charged with making surethat there are safe and effective products on the market would ever findnicotine-containingcigarettes... are safe and effective."</tt> [10<p><p>	To be sure, Commissioner Kessler has said that he ]<tt>currentlydoes not intend to ban cigarettes entirely.  But the Agency acknowledges thatthe jurisdiction it now claims gives it the power to do so:</tt><p><tt>"Because cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are drug-devicecombination products, FDA may regulate them as drugs, devices, or both.Based on the record before the agency, regulation of cigarettes and smokelesstobacco products pursuant to the Act's device authorities is most appropriateat this time.  The alternative, regulating the products pursuant to theAct's drug authorities, might result in the removal of these products from themarket."</tt><p><p><tt>60Fed. Reg. 41,523-24 (emphasis added) (citations and footnoteomitted).</tt> [11<p>	The absurdity of this assertion is manifest.  How could Congress, which timeafter time has rejected specific proposals to grant FDA authority overcigarettes, and has repeatedly been assured by the Agency that it does not havesuch jurisdiction, possibly have <p>contemplated that FDA had the power to ban them all along?  The simple answeris that it could not.]<h2>I.		FDA's Assertion of Jurisdiction Over All </h2><tt><b>		Cigarettes Is an Unconstitutional Usurpation</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>of Powers Congress Has Reserved toItself</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Given the comprehensive program Congress has developed for the regulationof cigarettes, including a specific enactment to deal with "youth smoking,"FDA's assertion of plenary jurisdiction over all cigarettes-- and itscreation of a wholly new regulatory scheme to rival and supersede the programCongress created-- violates the fundamental separation of powers ordainedby the Constitution.  When President Clinton announced FDA's assertion ofjurisdiction, he admitted that he and Commissioner Kessler intended to "changethe law."  MTV Interview with President Clinton, U.S. Newswire, Aug. 11,1995, available in 1995 WL 6619217.  The long history ofCongress's actions to retain control over the sale of tobacco products,and FDA's own prior recognition of that unequivocal congressional intent,demonstrate that the President's admission was all too correct.</tt><p><tt>	The Constitution, however, forbids exercises of "executive authority"beyond the limits established by Congress.  Put simply, the President and theAgency have no authority to "change the law" enacted by Congress.  The power ofthe executive branch to take any action "must stem either from an act ofCongress or from the Constitution itself."  Youngstown Sheet&amp; TubeCo.v. Sawyer, 343U.S. 579, 585 (1952).  Neither thePresident nor the Agency has been so bold as to suggest that FDA's assertion ofjurisdiction over cigarettes is authorized by the Constitution.  Rather, theyimplicitly recognize that FDA, like other agencies, derives its power solelyfrom its authorizing statute, as read in light of all other congressionalenactments.  As the Supreme Court has held,</tt><p><tt>"The legislative power of the United States is vested in the Congress, andthe exercise of quasi-legislativeauthority by governmental departments and agencies must be rooted in a grant ofsuch power by the Congress and subject to limitations which that bodyimposes."</tt><p><p><tt>Chrysler Corp.v. Brown, 441U.S. 281, 302 (1979).See<i> </i>also U.S. Dept. of HHSv. Federal LaborRelations Authority, 844F.2d 1087, 1095 (4th Cir. 1988) ("Theexecutive branch... simply has no power to make the law; thatpower rests exclusively with Congress,"); Killipv. Office ofPersonnel Management, 991F.2d 1564, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("An agencyis but a creature of statute.  Any and all authority pursuant to which anagency may act ultimately must be grounded in an express grant fromCongress.").</tt><p><tt>	By repeatedly acting through specific and comprehensive legislation,Congress has reserved to itself the power to regulate tobacco products.In so doing, Congress has delineated precise roles for certain administrativeagencies and the States; but it has refused to provide any such role toFDA.</tt><p><tt>	Until August 1995, FDA itself had repeatedly accepted that longstandingcongressional decision, and had expressly acknowledged that it did not havegeneral authority to regulate cigarettes.  It is settled law that congressionalacceptance of such a longstanding agency interpretation is binding on theAgency.  As the Supreme Court has stated, in a case involving FDA, "[O]nce anagency's statutory construction has been 'fully brought to the attention of thepublic and the Congress,' and the latter has not sought to alter thatinterpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects, thenpresumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned."  UnitedStatesv. Rutherford, 442U.S. 544, 554 n.10(1979).</tt>[12<p>	Indeed, FDA itself has previously recognized that this acknowledgment by bothCongress and the Agency further establishes that it does ]<tt>nothave authority to regulate cigarettes:</tt><p><tt>"Since at least the issuance of the Surgeon General's Report on smoking in1964, cigarettes have been at the forefront of discussions of the publichealth-- in Congress, in the Executive Branch, in the news media, andamong the public generally.  The participants in these discussions over thepast 15 [now 30] years or more would be shocked to learn that during all thistime FDA has had jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes as drugs, and presumablyto ban them."</tt>[13<p><p>	The Supreme Court's decision in ]<tt>NLRBv. Bell AerospaceCo., Div. of Textron, Inc., 416U.S. 267 (1974), is controlling here.There, the Court considered whether certain employees were covered by thecollective bargaining provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.  The NLRBhad concluded that, even though the employees held managerial positions, theact applied to them.  That view, however, departed from the NLRB's longstandingposition that managerial employees were outside the scope of the act, aninterpretation Congress had accepted.</tt><p><tt>	The Court rejected the Board's new interpretation.  Relying on "severalestablished principles of statutory construction," the Court held that</tt><p><tt>"a court may accord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placedon a statute by an agency charged with its administration.  This is especiallyso where Congress has re-enactedthe statute without pertinent change.  In these circumstances, congressionalfailure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidencethat the interpretation is the one intended by Congress."  Id.at274-75 (emphasis added).</tt>[14<p><p>	This principle is dispositive.  Congress has consistently refused to grant FDAauthority to regulate cigarettes, even after specific proposals to amend theFDCA.  Rather, Congress has in effect "reenacted" the 1976 Device Amendments.It has passed significant amendments focused on FDA's authority over devices,in 1990 and 1992, and it has enacted at least a dozen other amendments to theFDCA since 1938 dealing with FDA's authority to regulate medical products, both"drugs" and "devices."  For the Agency now to assert plenary jurisdiction overcigarettes is an unlawful usurpation of congressional authority even moreegregious than the one struck down in ]<tt>Bell Aerospace.</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court has likewise recognized that, where an entire industryhas relied for many years on a precedent based on statutory construction, anychange in that construction must come through congressional action.Clearly, the tobacco industry has relied on FDA's longstanding recognition ofits lack of jurisdiction over cigarettes and Congress's repeated refusals to"change the law" to grant the Agency such authority.</tt><p><tt>	On this point, Floodv. Kuhn, 407U.S. 258 (1972),is compelling.  There, the Court was asked to end baseball's traditional"exemption" from federal antitrust laws established in a 1922 judicial decisionfounded on notions of interstate commerce which, by 1972, had long since beenabandoned.  While characterizing the "exemption" as an "anomaly," the Courtnevertheless refused to overturn the earlier statutory interpretation.  TheCourt cited the existence of settled expectations and congressionalacquiescence, and emphasized factors that are just as applicable to FDA'sunprecedented attempt to regulate tobacco:</tt><p><tt>"[B]aseball, with full and continuing congressional awareness, has beenallowed to develop and to expand unhindered by federal legislative action.Remedial legislation has been introduced repeatedly in Congress but none hasever been enacted.  The Court, accordingly, has concluded that Congress asyet has had no intention to subject baseball's reserve system to the reach ofthe antitrust statutes.  This, obviously, has been deemed to be somethingother than mere congressional silence and passivity."  Id. at 283(emphasis added) (citing cf. Boys Markets, Inc. v. RetailClerk's Union, 398 U.S. 235, 241-42 (1970)).</tt><p><p><tt>	In language controlling here, the Court held that the only appropriateforum for any reversal of such a longstanding and established public policychoice was Congress itself:</tt><p><tt>"'Congressional processes are more accommodative, affording the wholeindustry hearings and an opportunity to assist in the formulation of newlegislation.  The resulting product is therefore more likely to protect theindustry and the public alike.'"</tt><p><p><tt>Id. at278 (quoting Radovich<i></i>v. NationalFootball League, 352U.S. 445, 451-52 (1957)).</tt><p><tt>	Clearly, there has been more than "mere congressional silence andpassivity" with respect to FDA regulation of cigarettes.  Much more.  Since atleast 1964, Congress has been well aware of the asserted health risksassociated with tobacco products, and has repeatedly enacted specificlegislation addressing them.  In so doing, however, Congress has established afirm policy against FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes.  As the D.C.Circuit stated in ASH<i></i>v. Harris, "If the [FDCA]requires expansion [to cover cigarettes], that is the job of Congress."655F.2d at243 (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	In sum, FDA is bound by the long-settledinterpretation of the FDCA as not reaching cigarettes marketed withouttherapeutic claims.  Therefore, the current rulemaking is unlawful and shouldbe abandoned.</tt><p><H3><a href=vol2.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

<b>VOLUME II</b>

A PRODUCT IS A DRUG OR DEVICE UNDER THE FEDERAL</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>	FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT BASED ON CLAIMS</b></tt><p>
MADE BY THE MANUFACTURER IN MARKETING THE
PRODUCT</b>

<p>
<tt>	We have shown in VolumeI of these comments that Congress has
withheld from FDA the power to regulate cigarettes under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), 21 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]321-

395.
 That congressional intent has been consistent and clear.  As a result, FDA's
present rulemaking is beyond its authority.  That fact should resolve this
matter and should result in the abandonment of this rulemaking.</tt><p>
<tt>	However, even apart from the considerations set forth in VolumeI,
the law Congress has given FDA to enforce-- the FDCA-- cannot apply
to cigarettes.  In its effort to squeeze cigarettes within the FDCA, FDA must
distort the statute in unprecedented ways, ignore established precedent
interpreting the FDCA, and rely on a melange of carefully selected
administrative "pronouncements" that, upon review, do not support FDA's legal
theory of jurisdiction over cigarettes.</tt><p>
<tt>	It is undisputed that FDA may not regulate cigarettes unless they are a
"drug" or a medical "device" under the FDCA.  Under the FDCA, a product is a
"drug" or a medical "device" if it is either "intended for
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease" or is "intended to affect the structure or any function
of the body."  21U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]321(g)(1)(B),
321(g)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  See also 21U.S.C.
[[section]][[section]]321(h)(2), 321(h)(3).</tt> "#fn37" [15  Thus, under the FDCA, a
product is subject to
regulation as a "drug" or "device" because of the uses for which it is
intended, not because of its inherent physical characteristics or the ways in
which consumers actually use it.<p>
	In its notice of proposed rulemaking, FDA asserts that (1)the nicotine
in cigarettes is a drug within the meaning of the FDCA because it is intended
to affect the structure or function of the body, and (2)cigarettes are
drug delivery systems and thus medical devices under the "structure or
function" branch of the definition of "device," 21U.S.C.
[[section]]321(h)(3).  60Fed. Reg. 41,465-

41,466.
 FDA's position is contrary to the FDCA as interpreted by Congress, the courts,
and FDA itself.]

and Sons, 870F.2d at 683.  Thus, as FDA itself recognizes, remote
physical effects do not make a product a drug; only significant effects can do
so.  60Fed. Reg. 41,469.</tt><p>
<tt>	Moreover, the only relevant effect is the effect communicated by the
seller in connection with the sale.  Accordingly, the "structure or function"
definition of "drug" and "device" under the FDCA is limited to products that
"purport literally to change the physical structure of the
body... or to alter its basic functions."
E.R.Squibb and Sons, 870F.2d at683 (citations omitted)
(emphasis added).  The definition requires "a representation that
the product will affect the structure of the body...."
United Statesv. An Article...Consisting
of 216 Individually Cartoned Bottles...Sudden
Change, 409F.2d 734, 742 (2d Cir. 1969) (emphasis added).  The need
for a "representation" follows from the fact that the "structure or function"
definition applies only to products "intended to" affect; it does not embrace
all products that have an effect.</tt><p>
<tt>	In addition, a product must affect the body "in some
medical--or drug-

type
fashion...."  Id.  This construction is
consistent with the legislative history of the "structure or function"
definition-- added when the FDCA was enacted in 1938-- which was
designed to reach "remedies" for conditions, such as obesity, that were not
considered diseases in 1938.  As with products recognized as "drugs" under the
1906 law</tt> [16] because they were "intended to
be used for the cure, mitigation or prevention of disease," Congress understood
that only products represented as having a therapeutic use would be drugs or
devices under the "structure or function" definition.  Walter Campbell, then
Chief of FDA, testified during Congress's deliberations that the amendment
would "provide for jurisdiction over the innumerable devices to which
therapeutic virtues are ascribed."  ]<tt>Hearings on S. 5 Before a
Subcomm. of the Senate Commerce Comm., 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 352 (Mar.
1935).</tt><p>
<tt>	Congress thereafter declared that the new "structure or function"
definition "extends the scope of the law to include...
therapeutic devices, and certain drugs that now escape regulation."

(S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd on other grounds,
744F.2d 912 (2d Cir. 1984).</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA itself has asserted that a product is a "device" that FDA may regulate
only when it is intended for medical purposes.  In the Brief for the United
States in United States v. An Undetermined Number of Unlabeled
Cases... Clinical Reference Laboratory, 21 F.3d 1026
(10th Cir. 1994) (No. 92-

3458),
FDA made clear that:</tt><p>
<tt>		"[C]ontrary to the contention made by CRL in its brief, the government
did not argue below that an article could fall within the definition of
`device', as set forth at 21 U.S.C. [[section]]321(h), without some
connection to a medical concern or issue.  See Doc. 24 at 15, n.5 ('[The
government does] not claim here that a device which has no medical application
could qualify as a device under the FDCA.')"  Brief for the United States at
16.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>Although that case involved the "treatment of diseases" definition of
"device" in 21 U.S.C. [[section]]321(h)(2), FDA did not limit its
disavowal to that subsection, but referred without qualification to
Section321(h), the "device" definition, as a whole.</tt><p>
<tt>	In short, a product is subject to FDA jurisdiction as a "drug" or medical
"device" under the "structure or function" definition only if (1) it is
claimed to have an effect, (2) the claimed effect is significant,
and (3) the effect is physiological or pharmacological in
character and has a therapeutic purpose.  Cigarette manufacturers do not
represent that their cigarettes are intended for any such effects or
purposes.</tt>
<h2>
K.		"Intended To" and "Intended Use"</h2>
<tt><b>		Are Determined by the Manufacturer's</b></tt><p>
<tt>		<b>Marketing
Claims&nsp;</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	As FDA has observed, the definition of "device" is a "statutory term of
art" which requires an "understanding of the term" as reflected in the
legislative history of the FDCA.  60Fed. Reg. 41,347.  The phrases
"intended to" and "intended use", in the definitions of "drug" and "device" in
the FDCA, refer to objective intent.  FDA affirms-- indeed
insists-- that evidence of objective intent is controlling in determining
a manufacturer's intended use for its product.  60Fed. Reg.
41,471.</tt><p>
<tt>	Objective intent under the FDCA has been authoritatively interpreted by
Congress, defined in FDA's own regulations, 21C.F.R.
[[section]]201.128 (drugs); 21C.F.R. [[section]]801.4
(devices), and reaffirmed in the well-

settled
case law.  These authorities conclusively establish that intended use is to be
determined from a product's label, labeling, promotional material, advertising,
and any other representations in conjunction with the distribution of the
product.  This evidence of "objective intent" under the FDCA, means the intent
of the manufacturer or vendor as determined by the claims and
representations made in marketing the product.  Whether a product is a drug
or device under the FDCA may be determined only on the basis of this kind of
evidence.  Thus, internal memoranda, published research, patents and other
materials whose contents have never been communicated in marketing claims for a
product are irrelevant in determining "objective intent."  Yet, it is precisely
these kinds of legally irrelevant materials on which FDA relies in its
jurisdictional analysis in asserting that cigarettes are medical devices.</tt>
<h3>
1.	  The Legislative History</h3>
<tt>	The legislative history of the phrases "intended use" and "intended to
affect" in the statutory definitions of "drug" and "device" is clear and
unambiguous.  It confirms how Congress prescribed that the requisite intent
should be determined:</tt><p>
<tt>"The use to which the product is to be put will determine the category into
which it will fall....  The manufacturer of the article,
through his representations in connection with its sale, can determine the use
to which the article is to be put."  S.Rep. No.361, 74th Cong.,
1st Sess. 240 (1935) (emphasis added); S.Rep. No.493, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess. 111-12 (1934) (same).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>The courts have treated this passage as authoritative.  See
ASH<i></i>v. Harris, 655F.2d at 239; Sudden
Change, 409 F.2d at 739; American Health Products, 574 F.Supp.
at 1506; Fairfax Cigarettes, 113 F.Supp. 336, 338 (D.N.J.
1953).</tt><p>
<tt>	Congress further specified the proper way to discern the requisite intent
when it discussed the classification of soap:</tt><p>
<tt>"While soaps sold only for ordinary toilet or household use are
specifically exempted from the definition of cosmetic and will not be subject
to the definition of drug, soaps for which claims concerning disease are made
or which are sold as pharmacopoeial articles will come within the definition of
drug and will thus be subject to regulation."</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>S.Rep. No.361 at239.  These two passages from the Senate
Committee Report make absolutely clear that the manufacturer can "determine,"
not merely influence, its product's intended use through "representations in
connection with [the product's] sale."</tt><p>
<tt>	The Agency's revisionist view of this legislative history in this
rulemaking impermissibly redefines the "intended to" language in the "structure
or function" definition in the FDCA.  FDA affirms that Congress intended that
FDA have jurisdiction over products because of fraudulent "claims" used to
promote the products' effects on the body.  The Agency nevertheless asserts
that the definition encompasses products that are promoted as having or that
"have" a significant pharmacological effect, and products "that affect"
structure or function.  60Fed. Reg. 41,467-

68
(emphasis added).  This expansive redefinition is flatly contrary both to the
plain meaning of the text of the FDCA and to its legislative history.  This
redefinition has also been squarely rejected by the courts when it was advanced
by FDA.</tt><p>
<tt>	Because the statutory language covers only products "intended to affect"
the structure or function, the courts have held that a product is a drug or
device by virtue of its intended use, not by virtue of its
inherent physical or pharmacological characteristics or
its actual effect on the body.  See, e.g.,
National Nutritional Foods Ass'nv. Mathews, 557 F.2d 325,
336 (2d Cir. 1977) ("Toxicity is not included as an element in the statutory
definition of a drug...."); Sudden Change,
409F.2d at 739; United Statesv. Kasz
Enterprises<cite>, </cite>Inc., 855F.Supp. 534, 539
(D.R.I. 1994); United Statesv. Two Plastic Drums of an Article
of Food, 791 F.Supp. 751, 753 (C.D. Ill. 1991), aff'd, 984
F.2d 814 (7th Cir. 1993); United Statesv.
3Cartons...No.26 Formula
GM..., 132 F.Supp. 569, 573 (S.D. Cal. 1952).
Thus, products that "have" an effect, and products "that" affect, are not, on
that basis, drugs or devices.  They must be intended-- claimed or
represented-- to affect the structure or function of the body.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA, itself, has applied this interpretation of the statute, and has
rejected the very view that it now puts forward in this rulemaking.  See
60 Fed. Reg. 41,467-68.  In denying the device portion of ASH's 1977 petition,
FDA ruled:</tt><p>
<tt>"[ASH's 1977 Petition] asserts that cigarettes per se affect the structure
and functions of the body.  However, effects alone do not establish
jurisdiction under section 201(h)(3) of the Act [21U.S.C.
[[section]]321(h)(3)].  Even assuming the accuracy of the assertions as
to the effects of cigarettes, the petition does not establish that these
effects are intended."  Letter from Mark Novitch to John Banzhaf and Peter
Georgiades (Nov.25, 1980) at5.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	As the Second Circuit said in National Nutritional Foods
Ass'nv. Mathews, 557 F.2d at 334-

35,
in rejecting another attempt by FDA to stretch a statutory definition in order
to expand improperly the Agency's jurisdiction:</tt><p>
<tt>"The determination that an article is properly regulated as a drug,
however, is not left to the Commissioner's unbridled discretion to act to
protect the public health but must be in accordance with the statutory
definition."</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>This judicial caution carries out the Supreme Court's admonition in 62
Cases of Jam v. United States, 340 U.S. 593, 600 (1951), that "[i]n
our anxiety to effectuate the congressional purpose of protecting the public,
we must take care not to extend the scope of the statute beyond the point where
Congress indicated it would stop."</tt>
<h3>
2.	  FDA's Regulations</h3>
<tt>	Consistent with the statutory language of the FDCA and its legislative
history, FDA's own regulations defining "intended use" focus on the public
expressions of the vendor-- primarily labeling and advertising--
and the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product:</tt><p>
<tt>"The words 'intended uses' or words of similar
import...refer to the objective intent of
the persons legally responsible for the labeling of drugs [or devices].  The
intent is determined by such persons' expressions or may be shown
by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article.
This objective intent may, for example, be shown by labeling
claims, advertising matter, or oral or written statements by such
persons or their representatives."  21C.F.R. [[section]]201.128
(drugs) (emphasis added); see 21C.F.R. [[section]]801.4
(devices).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>Nevertheless, the Agency now contends that objective intent can be
established "regardless of how the product is labeled or advertised."
60Fed. Reg. 41,474.  The standard of objective intent FDA is now
defending is thus contrary to the standard established in the Agency's own
regulations.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA concedes that these "intended use" regulations "have the force and
effect of law."  Id.  Without question, the Agency is bound by its own
regulations.  See, e.g., United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696 (1974) ("So long as this regulation remains in
force the Executive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as the
sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect and to enforce
it."); Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 386-

88
(1957); Orengo Caraballo v. Reich, 11 F.3d 186, 193 (D.C. Cir.
1993) ("Of course the agency may not violate its own
regulations... nor would we uphold an agency's interpretation
that would be 'inconsistent with the regulation [itself].'") (brackets in
original) (citations omitted); Clean Ocean Action v. York, 57
F.3d 328, 333 (3d Cir. 1995) ("An agency is bound by the express terms of its
regulations until it amends or revokes them."); Electronic Components
Corp. v. NLRB, 546 F.2d 1088, 1090 (4th Cir. 1976) ("It is well
settled that the rules and regulations of an administrative agency are binding
upon it....").</tt><p>
<tt>	Because "intended use" is based on evidence of objective rather than
subjective intent, it is not proven by what employees of a manufacturer or
vendor may say about the product in internal memoranda or what they say about
the product to people outside the company in contexts unrelated to the
product's sale or distribution.  Objective intent under the FDCA is proven only
by what the manufacturer communicates to customers in
connection with the sale and
distribution of a product.</tt> [17]<p>
	Under FDA's own regulations, the use of a product by consumers for a purpose
not claimed by the manufacturer or distributor in connection with its marketing
does not establish the product's intended use.  Under the regulations,
objective intent may be derived from the use of a product not intended by the
manufacturer ]<tt>only if it is "offered" for that use by
distributors, retailers or others not subject to the control of the
manufacturer:</tt><p>
<tt>"It may be shown by the circumstances that the article is, with the
knowledge of such persons or their representatives, offered and used for
a purpose for which it is neither labeled or advertised."</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>21C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]201.128; 801.4 (emphasis added).
Actual use is not sufficient to establish intended use under FDA's
regulation.  The article must be both (1) offered for an unlabeled use and then
(2) actually be used as offered.  That is the plain meaning of the regulations.
Nor do FDA's regulations define intended use on the basis of a product's
inherent physical characteristics.</tt><p>
<tt>	Not only does FDA have general regulations on "intended use", which focus
on claims in connection with a product being offered for sale, but FDA has
specifically reiterated that representations in connection with sale establish
intended use in determining whether a product may be a medical device:</tt><p>
<tt>"FDA will determine the intended use of a product based upon the
expressions of the person legally responsible for its labeling
and by the circumstances surrounding its distribution.  The most
important factors the agency will consider in determining the
intended use of a particular product are the labeling, advertising and other
representations accompanying the product."  45Fed. Reg. 60,579
(Sept.12, 1980).  (Emphasis added.)</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>This statement in a Federal Register preamble is an advisory
opinion binding on the Agency.  See 21C.F.R.
[[section]]10.85(e).</tt><p>
<tt>	Yet FDA presents not a shred of evidence from these "most important
factors" that any brand of cigarettes currently on the market is intended to be
used as a drug or a medical device.  Nor does FDA refer to or explain its
failure to apply the plain meaning of the statutory text and the interpretation
of that text long established by its legislative history, judicial decisions,
and the Agency's own regulations, administrative decisions, and advisory
opinion.  Rather, the kinds of information that FDA relies upon to try to
establish the intended use of cigarettes are not relevant factors under the
Agency's own regulations and advisory opinion.</tt><p>
<tt>	For example, FDA's regulations defining intended use say nothing about how
a product is designed or manufactured; what ingredients are added or merely
left in it; what research is conducted with respect to it; or what views
certain employees of a manufacturer may express internally.  Such factors,
under the FDCA and FDA's own regulations, are simply not legally
relevant to the objective intent with which a product is distributed.
Rather they are classic examples of evidence of subjective intent,
i.e., motives that are not publicly expressed.</tt><p>
<tt>	The distinction between "subjective" intent and "objective intent"
necessarily is not a matter of the nature of the evidence -

-

its form, what it consists of-- from which the intent is to be inferred.
Rather, it is a matter of what the evidence relates to or is evidence
of.</tt> [18]<p>
	"Subjective" intent is something that occurs in the mind of an individual
person or in the minds of individual people.  A wide variety of statements and
physical things can be evidence of subjective intent.<p>
	The term "objective intent," as used in FDA's regulations on intended use and
in judicial decisions interpreting the definitions of "drug" and "device" in
the FDCA, refers to something quite different from occurrences in the minds of
individual people.  "Objective intent" is something that arises from the
statements that accompany a product in commerce.  The focus is not on what
occurs in someone's mind, but rather on ]<tt>what is
said about a product -

-

how it is to be used and for what -

-

by its manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to those who may purchase it.
For this inquiry, the range of relevant evidence is much narrower than the
corresponding range for an inquiry into subjective intent.</tt><p>
<tt>	For an inquiry into "objective intent", the marketing statements by the
manufacturer in labeling and advertising generally are dispositive.  Where no
such statements are made, or the ones made are in need of interpretation (to
determine whether a therapeutic claim is being communicated), circumstances
relating to the distribution and sale of the product may be considered for such
light as they shed on how, and for what, the product is to be used.  In
determining "objective intent," the focus always is on what is being conveyed
to prospective users about how, and for what, the product is to be
used.</tt>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	The courts have consistently concurred with both Congress's and FDA's
long-settled interpretation of "intended use":</tt><p>
<tt>"[T]he crux of FDA jurisdiction [lies] in manufacturers'
representations as revelatory of their intent....
'The manufacturer of the article, through his representations in connection
with its sale, can determine the use to which the article is to be
put....'  Such an understanding has now been accepted as
a matter of statutory interpretation."  ASH<i></i>v.
Harris, 655F.2d at238-39 (emphasis added).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	"The vendors' intent in selling the product to the public is
the key element in this statutory definition."  National Nutritional Foods
Ass'n, 557F.2d at 333 (emphasis added).  The courts "have always
read the... statutory definitions employing the term
'intended' to refer to specific marketing
representations."  American Health Products,
574F.Supp. at 1505 (emphasis added).  "Congress has made a judgment
that a product is subject to regulation as a drug if certain promotional
claims are made for it."  Sudden Change, 409F.2d at 739
(emphasis added).  Accord, Hansonv. United States,
417F.Supp. 30, 34 (D.Minn. 1976) ("Countless court
decisions emphasize that it is the intended use of an article which
determines whether or not it is a 'drug'....")

386 (W.D. Pa. 1964) ("The real test is how was this product being sold?"),
aff'd, 347 F.2d 233 (3d Cir. 1965).</tt><p>
<tt>	This has been the law for seventy-

five
years.  This was also the state of judicial opinion when, in 1952, FDA's
"intended use" regulations were first promulgated.  See 17Fed.
Reg. 6818 (July24, 1952).</tt><p>
<tt>	As early as 1920, in Bradleyv. United States,
264F.79 (5th Cir. 1920), the court held that because of therapeutic
claims in the labeling of common mineral water-- recommending that the
water be used "in the treatment of Bright's Disease, Diabetes, Dropsy,
Cystitis, Gout, Rheumatism, Indigestion, Kidney and Bladder troubles"--
the water was a "drug."  As the Fifth Circuit explained:</tt><p>
<tt>"[T]he claimant has put the substance, water, in interstate commerce
with the recommendation that it possesses certain elements or
ingredients which are curative, or at least alleviative, for the diseases named
in the label.  He will not be heard now to say the substance recommended
is water and not a drug.  Such a construction would nullify the act of
Congress."  Id. at 81-82 (emphasis added).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	Despite FDA's claim to the contrary, no court has ever held that a
product is a "drug" or "device" in the absence of evidence of claims of
therapeutic or significant physiological effect on the body made in connection
with the sale of the product.  Yet nowhere in FDA's purported
justification of its assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes does FDA allege
that any manufacturer sells any current brand of cigarettes with
any claims or representations that they will have a significant
physiological or therapeutic effect on the function or structure of the body.
See 60Fed. Reg.41,482-520.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA's approach seems to be predicated on the reference to "any other
relevant source" in some judicial opinions which say that intended use "may be
derived or inferred from labeling, promotional material, advertising and any
other relevant source."  See National Nutritional Foods Ass'n,
557 F.2d at 334; Sudden Change, 409 F.2d at 739.  FDA reads this
reference as an invitation to consider any information related in any way to
cigarettes.  Yet the reference is not to "any relevant source" or to "any other
source" but rather to "any other relevant source," i.e., sources
which, like labeling, promotional materials and advertising, are relevant
because they are used in connection with the sale of the product.</tt><p>
<tt>	Advertising and "promotional materials" are statements designed to
encourage sale of a product.  Similarly, "labeling" under the FDCA refers to
information about a product disseminated as part of "an integrated distribution
program" in connection with a commercial transaction.  See
Kordel, 335 U.S. at 350; United States<i></i>v. Guardian
Chemical Corp., 410 F.2d 157, 161 (2d Cir. 1969) (to treat an article
distributed at a medical society as labeling would "stretch the meaning of
words beyond the limit of elasticity"); United States<i></i>v.
24 Bottles...Sterling Vinegar&amp; Honey,
338 F.2d 157, 159 (2d Cir. 1964) (labeling must be "presented to the consumer
in immediate connection with his view and his purchase of the product");
V.E. Irons, Inc.<i></i>v. United States, 244 F.2d 34, 38
(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 923 (1957) (labeling must be
shown to be "an integral part of the selling process"); Alberty Food
Products Co.<i></i>v. United States, 185 F.2d 321, 324-

25
(9th Cir. 1950).</tt><p>
<tt>	We are aware of no judicial opinion interpreting intended use in which the
"other relevant source" has been materials or statements that were never used
in conjunction with marketing.  FDA has not pointed to any judicial decision in
which the intended use of a product was inferred from the kind of information
on which FDA relies in this rulemaking-- internal documents, patents,
research documents, employee statements and other non-

public
expressions about the purpose, design, manufacturing or composition of a
product.  Rather, the courts have adhered to the original intent of Congress
and the plain statutory language that a product's intended use is established
by "representations in connection with its sale."</tt><p>
<tt>	The necessity for statements to be communicated to actual or prospective
customers if they are to be evidence of intended use was recently reconfirmed
with absolute clarity in United Statesv. Articles of Drug for
Veterinary Use, 50 F.3d 497 (8th Cir. 1995).  There, FDA contended that
promotional materials found at a manufacturer's factory were evidence of
the intended use of six products.  The manufacturer, Immuno-Dynamics, defended
on the ground that the written literature seized at the plant was not actually
distributed in this country to promote the six products but was printed for
other purposes.  Id. at 500.  After a jury verdict for Immuno-Dynamics,
FDA appealed.  The Agency contended that it was entitled to judgment as a
matter of law and that the mere existence of the literature established
intended use.  The court of appeals squarely rejected FDA's position and
affirmed:</tt><p>
<tt>"[T]he record in this case establishes a material factual dispute about
whether the written materials were promotional in nature, whether they were
ever distributed in relation to the six products seized, and if distributed
only in the past whether any customers were still relying on the past
representations as relating to the six products seized.  Thus, whether the
written materials evidenced the vendor's intent that the products be used for
drug purposes was properly a question of fact in this case and was properly
submitted to the jury."  Id. at 501.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>Thus, the court of appeals held that the mere existence of the literature
was not enough to make it evidence of intended use.  The issues the jury had to
decide were whether (1) the literature had been "distributed in relation to the
six products seized" and, if so, (2) "whether any customers were still relying
on the past representations as relating to the six products."  None of
the materials cited by FDA with respect to the cigarette manufacturers meets
either of these tests.</tt><p>
<tt>	In sum, Congress, FDA and the courts have repeatedly and consistently
concluded that the FDCA does not permit FDA to exercise jurisdiction over a
product as a drug or device unless the manufacturer or vendor makes for that
product, in connection with its sale, therapeutic claims that bring it within
one of the statutory definitions.  No manufacturer of any brand of cigarettes
currently being sold makes any claim that its cigarettes will affect the
structure or function of the body.  That undeniable fact stands as an
insurmountable legal barrier to the Agency's assertion of jurisdiction under
the FDCA.</tt><p>
<tt>	The legal springboard of FDA's entire rulemaking is discussed in one
footnote.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,482-

83
n.5.  FDA claims that "evidence regarding intended use [of cigarettes] has
changed dramatically" since 1980, "when the Agency last evaluated its legal
authority to regulate cigarettes as drugs or devices" and concluded that it
could not.</tt><p>
<tt>	We submit that the legally relevant facts have not changed, and that FDA
has failed to provide a "reasoned explanation" for its departure from
established precedent.</tt><p>
<tt>	More importantly, there is no dispute that the statute has not changed.
Nor have FDA's regulations defining intended use, nor the courts' authoritative
interpretation of the FDCA.  FDA's efforts to find the requisite intended use
in "new evidence" have required the Agency to try to invent a new law of
"objective intent" -

-

something it simply may not do.</tt>
<h3>
4.	  FDA May Establish Jurisdiction Over a</h3>
<tt><b>			Particular Product Only on the Basis of</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>			Evidence Relating to That Specific Product</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	Under the FDCA, the intended use of a product must be
determined on the basis of claims made in connection with the sale of a
product.  The claims must be current and must be made for a
particular product in connection with its marketing.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA, however, ignores the law by purporting to determine the intended use
of one brand of cigarette on the basis of information that concerns another
brand, or brands made by another company, or experimental cigarettes never sold
at all.  In addition, FDA relies on outdated information as evidence of the
intended use of currently marketed cigarettes.  Finally, FDA treats internal
company materials and statements by certain company employees as the corporate
position, for all time, of an entire company.  Because many of these materials
and statements deal primarily with research and development, they have nothing
whatsoever to do with the sale, marketing or distribution of any currently
marketed cigarette.</tt> [19]<p>
	The "facts" FDA recites do not establish the current intended use for any
brand of cigarettes.  Such an amalgamation of bits and pieces of outdated and
irrelevant materials cannot support a jurisdictional determination.]<p>
<tt><b>			a.	Jurisdictional Determinations Must</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>				Be Made on a Product-

by-
Product,</b></tt><p>
<tt>				<b>Case-

Basis&nbp;</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	Under the FDCA, the terms "drug" and "device" apply to a
particular "article."  See, e.g., United
Statesv. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U.S. 453, 459 (1983).
Whether an "article" meets the statutory definition depends on its
"intended use" or on whether it is "intended to affect."  Thus, in
ASH<i></i>v. Harris, the court correctly observed that,
"[t]he very structure of the Act which the FDA must
administer... calls for case-

by-
case
analysis."  655F.2d at 242 n.10 (emphasis added).  Likewise, as the court
in Estee Lauder, Inc.<i></i>v. FDA explained, even for
products manufactured by the same company, there must be </tt><p>
<tt>"an extensive fact-

based
determination as to exactly what the labeling and advertising for each product
is now and has been in the past.  This Court would also have to make a fact-

based
determination as to the `intended use' of each of the Lauder products."
Estee Lauder, 727 F. Supp. at 4.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	Specific brands of cigarettes have been targets of FDA enforcement actions
on only two occasions:  in United Statesv. 46 Cartons, More or
Less, Containing Fairfax Cigarettes, 113 F. Supp. 336 (D.N.J. 1953), and
United States<i></i>v. 354 Bulk Cartons...
Trim Reducing-

Aid
Cigarettes, 178 F. Supp. 847 (D.N.J. 1959).  In each case, FDA based its
action on the labeling claims for the specific brand.  In neither case did FDA,
or the court, suggest that the therapeutic claims made for the product at issue
could or should be imputed to the entire industry or, indeed, to any other
product.</tt> [20]<p>
	Case-

by-
case
evaluation of intended use is required because a product's legal status can
change over time, depending on whether or not at the time in issue therapeutic
claims are being made in conjunction with its sale.  As explained in
]<tt>United States<i></i>v. Articles of
Drug... Neptone, Civ. No. C-83-0864 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 25,
1983), FDLI Series, Seizures, 1983-

84,
15-- a case relied upon by FDA in its jurisdictional analysis, 60 Fed.
Reg. 41,476, 41,482-- in which the court determined that a freeze-

dried,
powdered New Zealand green mussel was a drug, based on the manufacturer's
labeling and promotional brochures:</tt><p>
<tt>"The Court does not view this opinion as establishing for all time that
Neptone is a drug.  The determination that Neptone is a drug rests entirely on
the pattern of promotion used by claimant in the several years immediately
preceding the instant seizure.  Should Neptone again be marketed after some
hiatus and a change in labelling, this order will not necessarily work an
estoppel on whether that batch of Neptone is a drug."  Id. at 18.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	Similarly, in Sudden Change, 409 F.2d at 742, in ruling that
promotional claims for a face cream caused the product to be a drug, the court
of appeals held that "if the claimant ceases to employ these promotional claims
. . . the product will not be deemed a drug for purposes of the Act."</tt><p>
<tt>	Likewise, in United States<i></i>v. Eighteen Units, More
or Less of an Article of Drug... "Sports Oxygen", Civ.
No. 89-

2085
(Oct. 17, 1992), FDLI Series, Seizures, 1991-

92,
110, another case FDA relies upon in its jurisdictional analysis, the court
noted that "aggressive" pre-

1988
claims were irrelevant to whether the product was a drug in 1992.  Id.
at 117.  "[U]nless Claimant has reason to know that these promises continue to
influence customers in 1992, these prior promises are not objective proof of
Claimant's present intent."  Id.</tt><p>
<tt>	Most recently, in United Statesv. Articles of Drug for
Veterinary Use, 50 F.3d at 500, the court of appeals observed:</tt><p>
<tt>	"Promotional materials are relevant to intent so long as they are
currently being distributed with the product, and if not, there must be
evidence that customers are still relying on the representations made in
promotional materials distributed in the past...."
(emphasis added).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	All these cases reaffirm that intended use is determined by a specific
manufacturer's representations made in conjunction with selling a specific
product.  In each case, the court recognized that intended use could change if
marketing claims changed.  However, there can be little doubt that the
employees of Estee Lauder, Neptone, and the other companies continued to write
internal memoranda, continued their research, continued to change manufacturing
methods and continued to "believe" in their company's product long after the
claims to which FDA objected had been withdrawn.  If these subjective
expressions and activities, rather than new labels, could support a
determination of "objective intent," these judicial opinions would be
meaningless.</tt><p>
<tt>	In fact, FDA's own view has been consistent with these judicial
interpretations.  During the same period as the ASH and Estee
Lauder decisions, former FDA Commissioner Young explained to Congress that
FDA lacks jurisdiction over cigarettes; he observed that "FDA must decide, on a
case-

by-
case
basis, which product is subject to the FDC Act."  Hearing Before the
Subcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm. on Energy and
Commerce at 4 (July 29, 1988) (emphasis added).</tt><p>
<tt>	Commissioner Kessler has also recognized that the "intended use" standard
requires case-

by-
case
assessment.  In his March 1994 testimony before Congress, the Commissioner
alleged that evidence before the Agency indicated that tobacco companies
control the levels of nicotine in cigarettes.  Yet he urged caution:
"Certainly practices differ within the industry and the technology available to
one company may not be available to another.  It is important to keep this in
mind."  Regulation of Tobacco Products:  Hearings Before the Subcomm. on
Health and the Environment of the House Comm. on Energy and Commerce (Part
I), 103d Cong., 2d Sess., at 29 (Mar.25, 1994).  In initiating the
current rulemaking proceeding, however, FDA failed to keep it in mind.</tt><p>
<tt>	During his March 1994 testimony, Commissioner Kessler testified about
animal self-

administration
studies that allegedly demonstrate the addictive nature of nicotine.  When
asked by Representative Waxman which company sponsored those studies,
Commissioner Kessler refused to answer.  He explained:  "I understand the
problem of not releasing the name is that I may, unfortunately, cast aspersions
on other companies...."  Id. at 36.  The
Federal Register documents that initiated the current rulemaking
proceeding, however, cast aspersions all around, without acknowledgment of any
distinctions among companies or among products.</tt><p>
<tt>	In June 1994, Commissioner Kessler once more appeared before Congress.  In
discussing an unnamed company handbook, which allegedly describes the use of
ammonia in the manufacturing process, Commissioner Kessler commented:  "How
widespread is ammonia use in the industry?  The company handbook states that
many U.S. tobacco companies use ammonia technologies.  Until we have access to
similar documents from other companies, we will not know whether other
companies intentionally use it to affect nicotine levels."  Hearings Before
the Subcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm. on Energy and
Commerce Part 3 at 11 (June 21, 1994).</tt> "#fn54" [21<p>
	Evidence of a general "industry practice" is not evidence of the intended use
of a particular product.  Assessment of the claims for individual products is
required.  A rulemaking procedure cannot provide justification for bypassing

review of intended use mandated by the FDCA.]<p>
<tt><b>			b.	In Its Proposal, FDA Does Not Make</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>				Product-

by-
Product
Determinations</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	The proposed rule itself states that "the FDCA `calls for
case-

by-
case
analysis.'"  60 Fed. Reg. 41,483 n.5.  Yet FDA then repeatedly disregards this
principle and, while purporting to adhere to the admonition that an agency may
"depart from its prior interpretations" only if it "provide[s] a reasoned
explanation for its action," ASHv. Harris, 655 F.2d at 242
n.10, offers no explanation for its departure from such longstanding
precedent.</tt><p>
<tt>	Throughout its Notice, FDA discusses information about one cigarette brand
or one company and then uses it to justify its assertion of jurisdiction over
all brands of cigarettes made by all companies.  For example, FDA
alleges that tobacco manufacturers deliberately control the level of nicotine
in cigarettes.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,509-41,512.  As "proof," FDA points to Brown
&amp; Williamson's development of the Y-

1
plant and to as-yet-undisclosed notes taken by FDA officials during visits at
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  Id. at 41,510, 41,704.  Even if the
Agency's specific references to Brown&amp; Williamson were true, they are
irrelevant to the intended use of cigarette brands marketed by RJR, just as the
notes taken about RJR are irrelevant to the intended use of cigarette brands
marketed by Brown&amp; Williamson.</tt><p>
<tt>	Similarly, FDA alleges categorically that tobacco manufacturers have tried
to alter the characteristics of nicotine in cigarettes.  As "proof," FDA points
to Philip Morris's alleged pharmacological research on acetaldehyde as a
reinforcer.  Id. at 41,514; 41,759-

62.
 Those allegations, even if true, are irrelevant to, and cannot be attributed
to, Brown&amp; Williamson, RJR or any other manufacturer.  FDA compounds
this inappropriate attribution by often highlighting singular incidents or
activities that involved only a single company or unique circumstances, or that
occurred several years ago.</tt><p>
<tt>	In VolumeIV of these comments, we respond more fully to FDA's
general allegations that cigarette manufacturers "manipulate" nicotine in their
agricultural and manufacturing practices.  In addition, individual companies
are filing their own comments in response to FDA allegations regarding their
research and other activities.</tt><p>
<tt>	To determine that a product is a drug or device, even on FDA's legal
theory of intended use, the Agency must examine the facts relevant to a
specific product's intended use.  That examination necessarily requires
resolution of "adjudicative facts," i.e., facts which "answer the
questions of who did what, where, when, how, why, with what motive or
intent."  2 Davis K.C. and Pierce, Jr., R.J., Administrative Law
Treatise [[section]] 10.5, at 141 (1994) (emphasis added).  "Adjudicative
facts are usually specific because they are about particular parties."
Id. at 145.</tt><p>
<tt>	In this rulemaking, however, FDA attempts to rest threshold jurisdictional
determinations on "legislative facts," i.e., those facts which
"do not usually concern the immediate parties but are the general facts that
help the tribunal decide questions of law and policy and discretion."
Id. at 141.</tt> [22]  As the courts and
FDA have previously recognized, threshold jurisdictional determinations under
the FDCA involve particularized adjudicative facts, which are distinct for each
of "the immediate parties."  ]<tt>See ASH<i></i>v.
Harris, 655F.2d at 242 n.10; Estee Lauder, 727 F. Supp.
at4; Two Plastic Drums of An Article of Food, 791 F.Supp. at
753 (the definitional status of a product with the same properties but in
another context is "not relevant to the facts in this case").</tt><p>
<tt>	Because the Agency has not presented partcularized facts on a product-

by-
product
basis, its "jurisdictional analysis" has not established that any particular
brand of cigarette has an intended use that makes it a "drug" or medical
"device."  Therefore, the "jurisdictional analysis" does not identify a basis
for the proposed regulations to apply to any brand.</tt><p>
<tt><b>			c.	FDA Relies on Information</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>				Not Relevant to Establishing</b></tt><p>
<tt>				<b>Intended
Use&nbsp</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	The Agency's "evidence" on intended use consists largely of
dated statements made by individual company employees and not disseminated in
connection with the marketing of products.  Because a product's intended use
can change over time, analysis must focus on current statements
attributable to the manufacturer and made in connection with the sale of a
brand it is currently marketing.  FDA also relies on patent applications filed
by individual cigarette manufacturing companies, as alleged "evidence" of their
ability to manipulate and increase nicotine levels.  FDA's suggestion that
these patents constitute relevant evidence of the intended use of any marketed
cigarette is incorrect both factually and legally.</tt><p>
<tt><b>				1.  Outdated Statements</b></tt><p>
<tt>	FDA itself admits that a product's legal status under the
FDCA can change over time.  The Agency acknowledges that cigarettes were not
drugs when ASHv. Harris was decided in 1980, but it asserts
that the "evidence regarding intended use has changed dramatically."  60 Fed.
Reg. 41,482 n.5.  Yet it relies extensively on statements that predate even the
opinion in ASHv. Harris to support its claim that today's
various brands of cigarettes are drugs.  FDA does not, however, even attempt to
demonstrate that any of these dated statements apply to any currently marketed
brand.  They are, for that reason as well as all of the others discussed in
this section, legally irrelevant.</tt><p>
<tt><b>				2.	Statements by Individual Employees</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	Not only are statements that FDA relies on outdated, but
they also are irrelevant to the marketing and sale of cigarettes to consumers.
Throughout the Notice, FDA relies on statements by tobacco company personnel,
very often researchers, to establish intended use.  See,
e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 41,583.  Over two hundred pages in FDA's
Notice are dedicated to presenting selected statements of individuals culled
from the past thirty-

five
years.  Id. at 41,583-

784.
 Yet these are all "internal statements."  Id. at 41,583.  Because these
statements were never made in connection with the marketing of products, they
are not relevant evidence of intended use under the FDCA.</tt><p>
<tt>	Moreover, many of these documents were not even written for general
distribution within a company.  They are primarily "research reports and
conference summaries," id. at 41,583, designed to promote discussion
within a company group or division.  FDA presents no evidence that they were,
or subsequently became, the official corporate position of a particular
cigarette company; or that they establish the intended use of any brand.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA goes so far as to rely on a research proposal from 1969 (which
it does not assert, much less show, was ever implemented), id. at
41,590, and a 1974 note from one scientist to another, id. at
41,611-

12,
as somehow indicative of the institutional intent of all cigarette
manufacturers today.  Draft proposals and interoffice notes cannot credibly be
taken as the official position of the corporation involved, much less of the
several companies that make up the industry.</tt> "#fn60" [23<p>
	The issue is not what the research department or the patent department or even
the marketing department thinks or says internally about the product.  Rather,
the issue is what the company, as an institution, says about the product to
prospective users.  FDA recognizes, with respect to itself, that not all
statements by individual agency employees can be regarded as reflecting an
institutional intent:<p>
	"A statement or advice given by an FDA employee orally, or given in writing
but [not as a formal advisory opinion], under this section or
[[section]]10.90, is an informal communication that represents the best
judgment of that employee at that time but does not constitute an advisory
opinion, does not necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does
not bind or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the view expressed."  21

88
(D.D.C. 1985) (distinguishing between views expressed by individual employees
and advisors and an institutional conclusion).  The same common-

sense
rule applies to product manufacturers.</tt><p>
<tt>	In sum, statements by individual company employees not communicated as
part of a product's marketing to actual or potential consumers are not evidence
of intended use.  They are not part of the marketing, distribution or sale of a
product.  They are not institutional expressions of a manufacturer, and cannot
necessarily be attributed to the speaker's employer.  They certainly cannot be
attributed to any other company.  At most, such statements are merely
evidence of some individual's subjective state of mind (not even necessarily
intent), which is irrelevant to intended use under the FDCA.  60 Fed. Reg.
41,472-73.</tt><p>
<tt><b>				3.	Patents</b></tt><p>
<tt>	FDA also asserts that patents obtained at various times over
the past 30 years and belonging to individual tobacco manufacturers, may be
evidence of intended use. See, e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 41,674,
41,678, 41,683-

84,
41,689, 41,700-

01,
41,776, 41,780-

84.
 However, patent applications and patents, which are not connected with the
marketing or sale of products, simply set forth possible embodiments of an
invention.  They do not necessarily represent any actual product as currently
marketed, and they are not relevant evidence of intended use.</tt><p>
<tt>	Indeed, Commissioner Kessler himself admitted at the March 1994 hearings
that, "[i]t is prudent to keep in mind that patents do not necessarily tell us
what processes are currently being used in manufacturing cigarettes."
Prepared Testimony of David A. Kessler Before the House Subcomm. on Health
and the Environment, reprinted in Regulation of Tobacco Products:
Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm.
on Energy and Commerce (Part I), 103d Cong., 2d Sess., at 81 (Mar.25,
1994).  FDA likewise "recognizes that the mere existence of a patent is not
confirmation that the patent holder is using the invention claimed in the
patent."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,780.</tt><p>
<tt>	Nevertheless, FDA claims that "[e]valuation of the type and scope of
patent assignments to an individual company does, however, provide evidence of
the capabilities and interests of the individual company."  Id.  Yet the
"capabilities and interests" of an individual company are not evidence of the
marketing and sale of a particular product made by that company.  Certainly the
"patent assignments to an individual company" have no
bearing at all on the intended use of products manufactured by another
company.</tt><p>
<tt>	Individual cigarette manufacturing companies have patented many processes
developed by their scientists, patents concerning the various constituents of
tobacco smoke, including nicotine.</tt>[24]  In
fact, many of these patents were available for review and consideration when
FDA rejected ASH's petition in 1980.  Whatever theoretical capabilities
individual companies may have developed concerning nicotine, the fact is that
these processes have been used to reduce nicotine levels; cigarette companies
have never used any of the patents FDA references to increase levels of
nicotine in commercial cigarettes in the United States.]<tt></tt>
<h2>
L.		FDA Relies on an Erroneous Legal Standard</h2>
<tt><b>		and Legally Irrelevant Information in an</b></tt><p>
<tt><b>		Effort To Support Its Assertion of Jurisdiction</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	In the face of overwhelming legal authority establishing that a
manufacturer's objective intent is the key element in determining its product's
intended use, and that such intent is determined by claims and representations
in labeling, advertising and similar materials connected with the sale and
distribution of the product, FDA asserts just the opposite-- that
intended use may be established "regardless of how the product is labeled or
advertised."  60Fed. Reg. 41,474.  FDA wholly disregards the governing
law of intended use.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA's jurisdictional analysis disregards the plain words of the FDCA, the
relevant legislative history, the Agency's own regulations, a vast body of case
law, and the interpretation of "intended use" in FDA's own prior decisions and
statements relating to cigarettes-- all of which
are contrary to FDA's current
position.  Instead, FDA relies on a legally irrelevant standard of
objective intent, and erroneous factual contentions, to justify its assertion
of jurisdiction over cigarettes as medical devices.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA's analysis is based on its contention that cigarette manufacturers'
objective intent can be demonstrated by any of three kinds of alleged
"evidence":  (1)that the pharmacological effects of nicotine in
cigarettes are foreseeable by manufacturers; (2)that many consumers use
cigarettes to obtain those effects; or (3)that manufacturers know that
cigarettes are used for pharmacological effects and have done various things to
facilitate that use.  60Fed. Reg. 41,464-

65,
41,482.  Specifically, FDA attempts to support its departure from established
law by:</tt><p>
<tt>		1.  adopting a foreseeability standard of "objective intent," derived
from statutes other than the FDCA, see
60Fed. Reg. 41,471-74; 41,476-79;</tt><p>
<tt>		2.  asserting that evidence of consumer use different from that
recommended by the manufacturer can establish a product's intended use,
id. at 41,479-80;</tt><p>
<tt>		3.  misreading selected judicial decisions on "objective intent" under
the FDCA, id. at 41,476;</tt><p>
<tt>		4.  suggesting that certain judicial opinions under the FDCA, and FDA
administrative pronouncements, establish that products can be drugs or devices
"even though they are not promoted for therapeutic purposes," id. at
41,468;</tt><p>
<tt>		5.  suggesting that a product's actual uses and inherent pharmacological
effects can establish intended use "even when there are no public expressions
by the seller that the product is to be used for those effects," id. at
41,475-76; and</tt><p>
<tt>		6.  claiming that physician use can establish a product's intended use in
the absence of labeling claims.  Id. at 41,480-81.</tt><p>
<tt>	Almost as an afterthought, FDA grudgingly acknowledges some role
for a manufacturer's promotion of a product in establishing intended use:
"Finally, a vendor's behavior or statements may also be
used as evidence of objective intent."  (Emphasis added.)  60Fed. Reg.
41,481.  This statement turns the law on its head.</tt><p>
<tt>	In fact, in repudiating its own regulations, FDA suggests that express
representations and promotional claims, which have long been recognized as the
determinative measure of objective intent are, instead, evidence of subjective
intent and cannot be trusted:</tt><p>
<tt>"Given the Act's focus on consumer welfare and public health protection,
interpreting the phrases 'intended for use' and 'intended to affect' to require
a showing of subjective intent-- which would limit the relevant
evidence to what is in the mind of the manufacturer or vendor as shown by
express representations, promotional claims, or otherwise--
would frustrate those legislative policy goals."  60Fed. Reg.
41,472-73.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	This statement does not make sense.  Intended use is a matter of what is
communicated to consumers.  Thus, claims and representations in labeling and
advertising are examined to determine what is being communicated to consumers.
Claims and representations are not examined to plumb the mind of a
manufacturer.  Whatever may be in the mind of the manufacturer is legally
irrelevant:  If the communication makes the product a "drug" or "device,"
nothing in the mind of the manufacturer can make it otherwise; if the
communication does not make the product a "drug" or "device," nothing in the
mind of the manufacturer can make it so.  That is how the law of intended use
has always been understood-- by Congress, the courts and FDA.</tt><p>
<tt>	It is FDA that is directing attention to subjective intent by examining
internal corporate documents and activities to try to draw inferences as to
what was or is in the minds of corporate employees, and away from objective
intent as determined by what cigarette manufacturers communicate to smokers in
the labeling, advertising, and promotion of their products.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA's legal analysis is fundamentally flawed.  First, the Agency
cannot regulate a product under a legal standard different from the one in its
own organic statute.  Second, consumer use has never been found by a
court to have established a product's intended use under the FDCA.
Third, the FDCA applies to products "intended to affect" structure or
function as determined by the manufacturer's "objective intent," not to
products "that affect" structure or function, 60Fed. Reg. 41,464, as
determined by "subjective intent."  Id. at 41,482.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA fails in its effort to avoid the fact that there is no evidence of a
jurisdictional "objective intent" as prescribed in FDA's own regulations:
here, manufacturers' claims and other representations in connection with sale
establish an "objective intent" wholly outside FDA's jurisdiction-- for
smoking taste and pleasure.  In fact, the judicial opinions on which the Agency
relies for the proposition that a product can be a "drug" or "device" even
though not promoted for a therapeutic purpose, involve products where
therapeutic claims were made.  In the judicial opinions under the FDCA
on which FDA relies to support its novel theory of "objective intent," the
manufacturers' claims were in fact the key element in the courts'
jurisdictional determination.  None of those judicial decisions supports
FDA's position that a product can become a drug or a device under the FDCA
"regardless of how the product is labeled or advertised."  60 Fed. Reg.
41,474.</tt><p>
<tt>	Equally, none of FDA's administrative precedents establishes that a
product can be regulated as a "drug" or "device" if it is not accompanied by
claims of therapeutic or significant pharmacological use.  Moreover, these
"precedents" consist of a handful of internal Agency memoranda authored by FDA
staff; enforcement actions that resulted in default decrees, consent judgments
or settlement; and advisory letters to industry members.  These unchallenged
assertions were not endorsed by any court and are entitled to little or no
deference:  "The simple fact that the [FDA] has a position, in and of itself,
is of only marginal significance."  United States<i></i>v. 29
Cartons...An Article of Food, 987F.2d 33, 38
(1st Cir. 1993).  Accord General Electricv. Gilbert,
429 U.S. 125, 141-45 (1976).  Even under the Agency's own regulations, these
documents did not express official FDA positions.  21 C.F.R.
[[section]]10.85(k).</tt><p>
<tt>	In addition, FDA relies on comments in several of its own proposed
rulemaking initiatives primarily involving over-

the-
counter
products that, depending on their labeling claims, may be regulated as either
drugs or cosmetics.  Properly read, these administrative pronouncements support
the established rule that intended use is determined by a manufacturer's
claims.</tt><p>
<tt>	More significantly, FDA's jurisdictional analysis entirely ignores a
substantial number of administrative precedents that are much more factually
relevant and that are contrary to the view of intended use the Agency now
takes.  Those omitted precedents relate to products that contained tobacco or
extracted nicotine.  In each instance, FDA's analysis of the product was
consistent with the established understanding of intended use set forth in
these comments, and was inconsistent with the novel legal theories on which FDA
relies in the cigarette rulemaking.</tt><p>
<tt>	In short, FDA's precedents do not support its attempt to proceed without
any evidence of manufacturer claims.  To the contrary, they reaffirm FDA's
settled practice of relying on labeling claims, or the related acts of a
manufacturer in the distribution and marketing of a product, to determine that
product's intended use.</tt>[25]
<h3>
1.		"Objective Intent" Under the</h3>
<tt><b>			FDCA Is Not Determined by </b></tt><p>
<tt><b>
Foreseeability&nbp;</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>	The legislative history of the FDCA, FDA's own regulations,
and the case law all demonstrate that, under the FDCA, a manufacturer's
"objective intent" is determined by the claims the manufacturer makes about a
product in connection with its sale or distribution.  Ignoring this
longstanding, judicially approved definition of objective intent under the
FDCA, FDA advances a theory of foreseeability which it claims is supported by
two court decisions interpreting the Federal Hazardous Substances Act ("FHSA"),
and one court decision interpreting the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA").  60Fed. Reg. 41,471-73, 41,477-79.</tt> "#fn60" [26<p>
	The fact that courts may have defined the standards of intent under the FHSA
and the FIFRA in terms of "foreseeability" has no relevance to this proceeding.
The relevant issue here is what Congress intended in ]<tt>the
FDCA, not the FHSA or the FIFRA.  See Fogertyv.
Fantasy, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 1028 (1994) (rejecting an argument to
give a provision in one law the same meaning as in another because the "goals
and objectives of the two Acts are... not completely
similar").  See also 2B Singer, N. Sutherland Statutory
Construction [[section]]53.05 at 238 (5th ed. 1992) ("The
interpretation of one statute by reference to an analogous but unrelated
statute is considered an unreliable means of discerning legislative
intent.").</tt><p>
<tt>	The courts have consistently concluded that under the
FDCA the intended use of a manufacturer's product is determined by the
manufacturer's claims and representations made in connection with the sale of
the product, not on a foreseeable use of the product.  No court has found that
Congress meant to permit a foreseeability standard in the FDCA, nor has any
court been so bold as to create one judicially.  And for good reason.  The
language of the FDCA does not use the word "foreseeable" or any synonym
thereof.  The text of the FDCA provides that the definition of "drug" and
"device" turns on intended use, not foreseeable use.</tt><p>
<tt>	Moreover, we are unaware of any FDA Federal Register
document or FDA formal administrative decision stating that a product can be a
"drug" or "device" on the basis of its foreseeable but unlabeled use.  FDA has
been administering the FDCA for nearly 60 years without resorting to
"foreseeable use."</tt><p>
<tt>	Reading a foreseeability standard into "intended use" under the FDCA would
be unworkable because it would convert every foreseeable off-

label
use of a drug or device into an intended use attributable to the manufacturer.
Under the FDCA, the intended uses of drugs and devices are required to be set
forth in their labeling.  See, e.g., 21C.F.R.
[[section]][[section]]201.57(c), 801.109(c), (d).  Certain drugs and
devices have unlabeled uses that have become accepted in the medical community.
FDA has long recognized that such uses play a beneficial role in proper medical
care.  And, although the Agency encourages manufacturers to apply for approval
to add such uses to the approved labeling, it accepts that physicians
foreseeably put approved drugs and devices to unlabeled uses without any
violation of the FDCA by any physician or manufacturer.  See
generally, e.g., 37 Fed. Reg. 16,503 (Aug.15, 1972);
40 Fed. Reg. 15,392, 15,393-

94
(Apr.7, 1975); <i>FDA Use of Approved Drugs for Unlabeled
Indications.</i> FDA Drug Bulletin2 (Apr. 1982); Nightingale, Stuart L.,
M.D. <i>Unlabeled Uses of Approved Drugs</i>. Drug Info. J. 26(2): 141 (1992).
Indeed, FDA policy acknowledges that drug and device companies may sponsor
programs in which unlabeled uses are discussed, so long as these activities are
not pursued in a promotional way.  See 57 Fed. Reg. 56,412,
56,414.</tt><p>
<tt>	The statutory language, legislative history, and regulatory framework
surrounding the FHSA and the FIFRA further show that both Congress and the
relevant administrative agencies entrusted with their enforcement-- the
Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") and the Environmental Protection
Agency ("EPA")-- envisioned a standard of intent entirely different from
the one set forth in the FDCA.  For example, the concept of "foreseeability"
appears repeatedly in the FHSA.  Essential terms such as "electrical,"
"mechanical," and "thermal hazard" are defined as articles which "in normal use
or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or
abuse..." cause injury.  15U.S.C.
[[section]]1261(r), (s), and (t) (emphasis added).</tt><p>
<tt>	Recognizing that Congress had in mind "tort law foreseeability concepts"
when it drafted the FHSA, the courts interpreting that statute have thus held
that the phrase "intended for use by children" implies an intent "like that in
tort law."  As the court in Foresterv. CPSC, 559F.2d
774, 786 (D.C. Cir. 1977), explained:</tt><p>
<tt>"FHSA is drafted in terms that strongly suggest intent to rely on tort law
foreseeability concepts.  For example, 'hazardous substance' is defined in part
as one that 'may cause substantial personal injury or substantial illness
during or as a proximate result of any customary or reasonably foreseeable
handling or use.'...  This construction [of intent] also
finds support in the legislative history...  [See]
S.Rep.No. 91-

237,
91st Cong., 1st Sess.6 (1969).  Also see H.R. Rep. No.91-

389,
91st Cong., 1st Sess. 12-

13
(1969)."  Forester, 559 F.2d at 786 n.14.</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	In contrast, neither the language of the FDCA nor its legislative history
reveals any congressional intent to include "tort law foreseeability concepts"
in FDA's statute.  In fact, the legislative history of the FDCA positively
excludes the use of such concepts to expand "intended use" beyond a
manufacturer's claims and presentations.</tt><p>
<tt>	United Statesv. Articles of Banned Hazardous
Substances... Baby Rattles, 614 F.Supp. 226, 230
(E.D.N.Y. 1985), relied on extensively by FDA, see 60 Fed. Reg. 41,471,
41,473, 41,477, 41,478, similarly holds that the phrase "toys intended to be
used by children" when interpreted "for purposes of the FHSA" includes
foreseeable use.  In that case, the distributor of the rattles claimed that
they were not "toys intended to be used by children" but were party favors or
decorations.  614 F.Supp. at 230.  The court found, however, that
although the product was not sold to toy stores, it was advertised in the "Toy"
section of the distributor's catalog.  Id. at 231.  Such advertising was
a claim or representation by the manufacturer, in connection with the sale of
the product, that it was a toy.</tt><p>
<tt>	The court interpreted the word "intended" under the FHSA by what it
called an objective test-- which the court held was "whether a reasonable
person would believe that the object is a toy or article intended for use by
children."  Id.  However, as discussed above, the FHSA does not have the
same legislative history with respect to "intended use" as does the FDCA, and
thus the language of the Baby Rattles decision provides no support for
FDA's attempt to apply either a foreseeability or a "reasonable person"
standard under the FDCA.</tt><p>
<tt>	Moreover, the court in Baby Rattles rejected the claimant's
argument that the phrase at issue should be interpreted as commonly understood,
rather than as Congress had intended in the FHSA.  Id. at 230.  Yet now
in this rulemaking, FDA seeks to do just that-- to interpret "intended
use" as FDA contends it is "commonly understood by the courts" in non-

FDCA
cases rather than as Congress meant that term in the
FDCA and as courts have interpreted it in cases under the FDCA.
See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,471.</tt><p>
<tt>	United Statesv. Focht, 882 F.2d 55, 59-

60
(3d Cir. 1989), which FDA relies on repeatedly in its discussion of intended
use, see 60 Fed. Reg. at 41,471, 41,477, 41,478-79, is merely another
FHSA decision in which a court observed that the definition of hazardous
substance "uses traditional foreseeability language" and, therefore, the
concept of intended use, as employed in regulations promulgated under
the FHSA, "necessarily encompasses foreseeability."  882 F.2d at
59-60.</tt><p>
<tt>	The meaning of intent under the FIFRA similarly has no relevance to the
concept of intended use under the FDCA.  EPA has consistently interpreted
intended use, under that very different law, to encompass more than
claimed uses.  Indeed, EPA's own regulations state that a "substance [is]
intended for a pesticidal purpose" if its manufacturer makes
pesticidal claims or </tt><p>
<tt>"[t]he substance consists of...one or more active
ingredients and has no significant commercially valuable
use...other than...use for
pesticidal purpose...; or [t]he person who
distributes or sells the substance has actual or constructive knowledge that
the substance will be used, or is intended to be used, for
a pesticidal purpose."  40C.F.R. [[section]]152.15 (emphasis
added).</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>By contrast, FDA's regulations, 21C.F.R.
[[section]][[section]]201.128 and 801.4, embrace a narrow, claims-

based
definition of intended use.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA's reliance on N. Jonas&amp; Co.v. EPA, 666
F.2d 829 (3d Cir. 1981), for the proposition that intended use includes a
reasonable-

consumer
standard is likewise misplaced.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,477-78.  In Jonas, the
court held that the substance at issue would be a pesticide under the FIFRA "if
a reasonable consumer-- given the label, accompanying circulars,
advertising representations and the collectivity of circumstances-- would
use it as a pesticide."  666 F.2d at 832.  The court took "intended use" to
mean what a reasonable consumer, exposed to those promotional messages, would
understand.  Id. at 833.  In Jonas, the message the manufacturer
promoted in selling its product easily allowed a reasonable consumer to
conclude that it was a pesticide.  The manufacturer was selling exactly the
same product, under the same name, in two packages, one that made pesticide
(algaecidal) claims and one that did not.  Id. at 831.  Thus, the
manufacturer created a situation in which the claims it made for one product
would be understood by consumers as applying to both.</tt><p>
<tt>	FDA simply cannot borrow a definition of "objective intent" from another
agency's statute in order to give legal effect to information or theories that
are irrelevant under its own enabling legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>	The Agency also asserts that the phrases "intended to" and "intended for"
denote objective intent "as that term has become commonly understood by the
courts."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,471.  FDA thereby suggests that the tort principle of
foreseeability should be superimposed on the FDCA standard of intent.  This
contention is wrong as a matter of law.  FDA cannot engraft the tort principle
of "foreseeability" onto the statute by administrative declaration.  The Agency
has cited no evidence that Congress intended such a result in enacting the
FDCA.  See Central Bank of Denver<i></i>v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 1451 (1994) (rejecting the
proposition that the "deeply rooted" tort principle of aiding and abetting
liability should be imported into statute where "there is no evidence that
Congress intended that liability").  Moreover, the legislative history
of the FDCA and past interpretations of that
statute by both the courts and FDA are flatly inconsistent with any such
interpretation.</tt><p>
<tt>	The only judicial authorities under the FDCA cited by FDA in support of
its suggestion that information about foreseeable or reasonable uses is
"relevant" to intended use are United Statesv. Dotterweich,
320 U.S. 277 (1943), and United States<i></i>v. Park, 421
U.S. 658 (1975).  See<i> </i>60Fed. Reg. 41,473-74.  Those cases
establish that an individual may be convicted of a violation of the FDCA even
though that individual neither intended, nor was aware of, the conduct causing
the violation.  Criminal liability is based, instead, on the individual's
"responsible relationship" to the violative event or condition.
Dotterweich, 320 U.S. at 283-

285;
Park, 421 U.S. at 672.  This doctrine, however, does not create an
obligation on the part of a company to foresee what third parties will do.  The
doctrine creates only an obligation on the part of an individual company
official to detect, prevent and correct FDCA violations within his or her zone
of personal responsibility in the company.</tt><p>
<tt>	Dotterweich and Park did not expand the substantive reach of
FDA jurisdiction, the scope of any definitions in the FDCA, 21U.S.C.
[[section]]321, the scope of any substantive requirements imposed by or
under the FDCA, or the scope of substantive violations defined in the statute.
Rather, they merely expanded the universe of individuals who may be held
criminally liable for such violations, just as Congress authorized.</tt><p>
<tt>	In Park, for example, the offenses charged consisted of acts
prohibited under 21U.S.C. [[section]]331(k).  Nothing in that
decision expanded the scope of Section331(k), or the scope of any
definition of any term used in that section.  Section 331(k) uses the term
"food," which is defined in 21U.S.C. [[section]]321(f).  Nothing in
Park interprets the term "food" as it appears in Section331(k).
More generally, nothing in Dotterweich or Park bears on the
interpretation of any substantive provision of the FDCA.</tt><p>
<tt>	Those decisions thus provide absolutely no support for FDA's proposed
expansive reading of the terms "drug" and "device" in 21U.S.C.
[[section]]321(g) and (h).</tt><p>
<tt>	Indeed, Dotterweich and Park counsel against FDA's
expansive reading of the definitional, and thus jurisdictional, reach of the
statute.  Precisely because, under those decisions, every violation of the FDCA
may be the subject of a criminal prosecution, the jurisdictional perimeter of
the statute should adhere closely to Congress's intent as manifested in the
statutory text and legislative history.  Proposed expansions of FDA
jurisdiction not contemplated by Congress or contrary to Congress's intent and
understanding must be rejected because, among other reasons, such expansions
would expose additional individuals to a risk of strict criminal liability not
intended by Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>	Dotterweich and Park also demonstrate that the Agency
cannot write "foreseeability" into the FDCA's "intended use" language.
In those cases, the Supreme Court upheld strict criminal liability because
Congress defined the prohibited acts under the FDCA without a traditional
<i>mens rea</i> requirement.  The statute makes it a crime to do or cause a
violative act.  There is no requirement that the act be done intentionally,
knowingly, or willfully, as is required in most other criminal statutes, and
under the common law of criminal intent.  See 21 U.S.C.
[[section]][[section]] 331, 333.  Thus, the Supreme Court applied the statute
as written and as Congress intended.  It did not read into the FDCA a
standard of criminal liability borrowed from either some other statute or from
the common law of criminal intent.</tt><p>
<tt>	Indeed, under the foreseeability theory FDA propounds, the government
should have filed criminal charges not only against Mr. Park, but also against
the food manufacturers who chose to sell their foods to the warehouses operated
by Mr. Park.  Given the history of previous FDA violations at those
warehouses-- which was set forth in letters from FDA and lists of
inspectional observations issued by FDA investigators concerning unsanitary
food storage conditions, all of which are publicly available documents--
FDA apparently would argue that the manufacturers should have foreseen that
their products would become adulterated as a result of being held under
unsanitary conditions at those warehouses.  The absurdity of such an
application of the FDCA is plain.</tt><p>
<tt>	In sum, there is no support for FDA's contention that, under
the FDCA, it is appropriate to apply a standard of
"foreseeability" to determine objective intent.</tt>

INTRODUCTION</h2>	As we have discussed in VolumesI and II of these comments, FDA has nojurisdiction over cigarettes marketed without therapeutic claims; and none ofthe manufacturers of cigarettes currently on the market makes any such claimsfor its products.  FDA's "findings," therefore, are legally irrelevant to theissue of whether the Agency has authority to regulate cigarettes.<p>	Nevertheless, to provide a full record and to address the many inaccurate andmisleading statements made by FDA, we comment on FDA's principal "scientific"arguments in "Nicotine In Cigarettes And Smokeless Tobacco Products Is A DrugAnd These Products Are Nicotine Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug,And Cosmetic Act," 60Fed.Reg. 41,545-41,787(the "Jurisdictional Analysis"). [1]<p>	In this volume of our comments, we first address FDA's contention thatnicotine has a significant effect on the structure or function of the body,including so-called"nicotine addiction."  Second, we review the "scientific" basis for FDA'sallegation that consumers smoke cigarettes "nearly exclusively" for thepharmacological effects of nicotine.  (Our comments here supplement ouranalysis of whether evidence of consumer use is relevant to establish amanufacturer's objective intent, as set forth in VolumeII of thesecomments.)  Third, we address FDA's claims that the nicotine yields ofcommercial cigarettes have increased independently of "tar."  <p>	In this volume, we will demonstrate that FDA has made numerous assertions of"fact" which are either unsupported or based on a mischaracterization of thescientific literature or industry documents and practices.  Indeed, the factsand other data in FDA's Jurisdictional Analysis have been manipulated, even tothe extent of disregarding the conclusions made by the authors of the studieson which FDA itself relies.  A careful review of the Agency's "scientific"section of its Jurisdictional Analysis reveals that, even apart from its legalinvalidity, any assertion of jurisdiction based on these "findings" would bearbitrary and capricious.]<h2>H.	THE PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE DO NOT</h2>	<b>JUSTIFY FDA'S ASSERTION OFJURISDICTION</b><p><p>	FDA claims that nicotine "has drug effects on the body."  Tosupport this assertion, the Agency discusses nicotine's pharmacological effectsand the purported status of "nicotine addiction.""fn1"  [2  Before reviewing FDA's "scientific evidence"concerning nicotine, we briefly review the legal parameters of this issue asdiscussed in VolumeII of these comments.<p>	]First, whether or not a product is a drug under the FDCA dependson the "intended use" of the product, as evidenced by the manufacturer's claimsmade in connection with its sale.  Thus, a product's actual effects onthe body are irrelevant to the issue of FDA jurisdiction in the absence oftherapeutic claims.  Second, even if a product is represented by themanufacturer for a particular effect, the claimed effect must besubstantial.  As FDA itself recognizes, the phrase "affect any structureor function of the body" does not mean that a product is a "drug" or "device"merely because it has some physical effect on the body."fn2"  [3  Only substantial effects fall within theambit of the statutory definition.  Thus, the issue here is not whethernicotine has an effect on the structure or function of the body, but ratherwhether the ]nature and degree of that effect is substantial.Finally, the "substantial" effect of a product must be for therapeuticpurposes.<p>	FDA relies extensively on its characterization of nicotine as an "addictive"substance, alleging that cigarette smoking leads to, and creates, an"addiction" to nicotine.  The definitions of "drug" and "device" in the FDCA,however, are not predicated on a finding that a product or one of itsingredients is "addictive," "dependence producing," or has a potential forabuse.  The Agency cannot change the statutory requirements of the FDCA simplyby using such terms, with their legally irrelevant connotations and politicalimport.  <h3>1.		The Effects of Nicotine Are Not Comparable</h3>		<b>to Those of AddictiveSubstances</b><p<p>	In an attempt to establish that nicotine has a substantial pharmacologicaleffect, FDA argues that nicotine is "addictive" and that the effects ofnicotine are similar to those of cocaine, heroin and other addictivesubstances. [4]  By use of the terms "addiction"and "addictive," FDA apparently is attempting to use rhetoric to convince thepublic that nicotine in cigarette smoke has ]substantial effects soas to justify the Agency's assertion of jurisdiction -- assuming "intended use"can be shown (which it cannot). [5]  <p>	FDA appears to have reached its conclusion that nicotine is "addictive" byusing definitions of the terms "addiction" or "dependence" that areover-inclusive, vague, and invalid.  Although a number of varying standards of"addiction" currently in use in the scientific literature and popular presswould classify nicotine as "addictive," under the arbitrary-and-capriciousstandard FDA's focus must be on scientifically verifiable criteria.  Under suchcriteria, neither cigarette smoking nor the nicotine in smoke is "addictive."<p>	Further, FDA cannot rely on shifting, unscientific and morally charged termssuch as "addiction" to establish jurisdiction.  FDA, itself, has acknowledgedthat the meaning of the term "addiction"-- and, of course, whether asubstance or activity is "addictive"-- has shifted over time and fromorganization to organization.6  Under FDA's theory of jurisdiction, a productcould likewise shift in and out of FDA jurisdiction as the definitions change.Such an amorphous and arbitrary determination of jurisdiction isimpermissible.]<h4>a.	  Terminology</h4>	Whether smoking or any of a number of other habits may be said to be an"addiction" depends exclusively on how that term is defined.  AsDr.Jerome Jaffe, the former Director of the Addiction Research Center ofthe National Institute of Drug Abuse, pointed out in 1990, in discussingwhether "the average cigarette smoker is dependent on tobacco (nicotine),""obviously, much depends on how dependence is defined.""fn5"  [7<p>	Traditionally, the term "addiction" was reserved to describe thepharmacological phenomena of intoxication, tolerance, and a physical dependencethat was manifested by withdrawal.  Today, however, the concept of "addiction"is often indiscriminately applied to a seemingly endless array of products andactivities.  Indeed, the scientific community has, in one study or another,labeled caffeine,8 carrots,9 running/jogging,10 pinball machines,11 sex,12chocolate,13 shopping,14 and love15 as "addictive."  As Dr.Jaffe hasstated, when the medical and scientific communities use the terms "addiction"or "dependence" to describe a wide variety of disparate behaviors, theiractions may "be seen as self-servingmaneuvers designed to medicalize undesirable behaviors."16 <p>	Thus, although some researchers now argue that many behaviors can properly belabeled as "addictions,"17 others believe that only those involving the use ofpsychoactive substances should be considered as "addictions" or"dependencies."18  The fact that some of the activities mentioned above,]e.g., jogging, may have a pharmacological effect, and aretherefore arguably similar to psychoactive substance "addictions,""fn26"  [19 has further complicated this debate.]<h4>b.	  Criteria of "Addiction"</h4>	There is no generally accepted set of criteria that must be satisfied in orderto classify a substance (or activity) as "addictive."  For example a 1988article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reporting onthe efforts of a multidisciplinary task force to standardize substance abuseterminology stated that "the lack of precise definitions and universalagreement on language has hampered effective communication amongprofessionals." [20]  In 1990, Dr.HerbertD. Kleber, formerly of Yale Medical School, similarly wrote that<p>"Many of the attempts to define the concepts of drug habituation, abuse, andaddiction have resulted in additional confusion.  The confusion is a result ofoverlapping definitions of abuse and dependence, [and the] injection of moralideas into scientific terms...."21  <p><p>	The broad criteria for "addiction" now in vogue with some researchers haveinfluenced the scientific community's view of whether cigarette smoking shouldbe deemed to be an "addiction."22  Under the traditional scientific definitionof addiction, cigarette smoking was ]not an "addiction."  Thus, the1964 Surgeon General's Report, which defined an "addiction" as "a state ofperiodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug(natural or synthetic)," concluded that smoking should be classified as an"habituation" but not an "addiction." [23] <p>	Similarly, the World Health Organization ("WHO") did not include tobacco inits compendium of substances that produce "dependence" until 1974.  Even then,WHO expressly treated tobacco as a special case:  WHO noted that, unlike thedependence-producing substances listed in the WHO compendium, tobacco<p>"produces relatively little stimulation or depression of the central nervoussystem, or disturbances in perception, mood, thinking, behavior or motorfunction.  Any such psychotoxic effects produced by tobacco, even when it isused in large amounts, are slight compared with those of the types ofdependence-producing drugs listed above."24  <p><p>	In 1980, the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's ("APA")Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ("DSM-III") included, forthe first time, a diagnosis of "tobacco dependence."25  To classify cigarettesmoking as a "substance dependence," DSM-III had to rewrite the definition of"dependence" to include criteria that were unprecedented.  In fact, thecriteria of "tobacco dependence" and "tobacco withdrawal" set forth in DSM-IIIwere largely psychological -- such as the desire to smoke ("craving") -- ratherthan physiological or pharmacological.26<p>	The APA's diagnostic classifications have been the subject of muchcriticism.27  In particular, the shift from objective physiological criteria tolooser psychological criteria has been challenged.  Dr.Stuart Kirksummarized the flaws of the DSM criteria as follows:<p>"(1)the inclusion of some diagnostic categories in DSM is the outcome ofmany social and political factors and is not necessarily grounded in scientificevidence,<p><p>"(2)the scientific evidence establishing the validity and reliability ofDSM in general and some of its diagnostic categories and criteria in particularare weak, and<p><p>"(3)the conception of substance 'dependence'...and its criteria are flawed."28<p><p><p>One author stated in 1991:<p>"moving away from the greater emphasis in the DSM-IIIon the physical aspects of dependence (exemplified by tolerance and withdrawalsymptoms) has appeared to some to contradict both widespread clinicalconviction and empirical data about the predictive validity of these symptoms.As well, shifting the criteria away from social consequences of alcohol abuseand dependence has seemed to be a movement away from a central feature of thesyndrome.  ]The DSM-III-R criteria for abuse and dependence, some haveclaimed, have also increased the heterogenity of dependence (by lowering thethreshold for its diagnosis), obscured traditional concepts of the substanceuse disorders (by embracing a dimensional mode of abuse-dependenceand thereby eschewing the traditional categoricalmodel...), and reduced the saliency of the concept ofabuse ..., despite some empirical evidence to thecontrary." [29] <p><p>	Similarly, in a recent commentary on the DSM-IVfield trial for substance abuse, the author stated:<p>"Another limitation of the DSM-IVprocess was the tendency to equate phenomenology with physicalism.  Considerthe diagnosis of alcohol dependence....  [T]he typicalapproach to alcohol dependence is to ask the patient standard questions, basedon the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, about drinking behavior, physical symptomsand subjective perceptions of the salience of drinking.  This approach reliesheavily on phenomenology, the construction of inner and outer reality accordingto the patient's own perspective as an observer.  Other information that mightcorroborate or supplement the self-descriptionof the patient is given a relatively minor role in the diagnostic procedure.<p><p>"Despite the numerical data generated from the interview measures, and thecomplex scoring algorithms that scan and piece together the symptom data,]the almost total reliance on phenomenology to measure, verify andconstruct psychiatric disorders is a major limitation of the entire process.Diagnostic classification in DSM-IV is dictated more by blind adherence to thedescription by the patient of the behavior than by a basic understanding of theunderlying determinants of that behavior.""fn59"  [30  <p><p>	The APA's inclusion of "tobacco dependence" in DSM-III was especiallycontroversial.  As one contemporary report noted:  "DSM-III has stirred afurious debate by adding tobacco dependency to a chapter on drug addiction."31Even the chief draftsman of DSM-III, Robert L. Spitzer, acknowledged that manypsychiatrists thought inclusion of the provisions on tobacco use was "a bigmistake, and even dangerous....  The main argument is thatthere are a lot of things people want to give up but are unable to--golf, butter, and chocolate, for example."32 <p>	The specific criteria for tobacco dependence and withdrawal were criticized aswell.  Drs. Kozlowski and Wilkinson stated that "[t]he withdrawal syndrome fortobacco [as defined in DSM-III-R]is singular among those described for the subjectivity of its symptoms."33<p>	In 1988, the Surgeon General adopted yet another definition of "addiction."Unlike other contemporaneous sources,34 the 1988 Report stated that the terms"drug dependence" and "drug addiction" were scientifically equivalent and,therefore, could be used synonymously.35  Applying these expansive criteria,the 1988 Report concluded that nicotine was "addictive."36<p>	The 1988 Surgeon General's Report is a clear example of how thepharmacological phenomena of intoxication, tolerance, and physical dependence-- traditionally considered the criteria in deciding whether to label smokingas "addictive" -- had been relegated by some to ancillary considerations.  Byaltering and broadening the definition of the term "addiction," the SurgeonGeneral and others were thus able to classify cigarette smoking as an"addiction."<p>	Dr.Jaffe described this change in definition as follows:<p>"In light of current views about tobacco dependence, it is reasonable to askhow it was possible to consider the behavior as anything other than a form ofdrug dependence.  Two major beliefs about addiction or drug dependence seem tohave played a role.  Firstly, marked drug ]tolerance and dramatic,obvious, and severe withdrawal phenomena were considered inherentaspects of the `true addictions.'  Secondly, addictions (morbid cravings fordrugs) were associated primarily, if not exclusively, with drugs which at somestage in their use induce states of intoxication, thereby affecting theusers' judgment, personality, and will-power.  It is not difficult to see inthe writings of respected scholars and researchers of the not too distant pasthow these beliefs could lead to a sharp distinction between tobacco use andother patterns of drug taking that were readily categorized asaddictions." [37]  <p>]<h4>c.		Cigarette Smokers Are Not "Addicted"</h4><b>			Under the Traditional Scientific</b><p>			<b>Definition of theTerm&nbs;</b><p><p>	The criteria of "addiction" used by FDA focus primarily on psychological,rather than physiological, factors.  Under these subjective criteria, virtuallyevery activity or substance that is pleasurable may be classified as"addictive."  As discussed below, however, under the traditional scientificcriteria of meaningful intoxication, withdrawal and tolerance, cigarettesmoking is not an "addiction."  <p>	The traditional scientific definition of "addiction" (a)focuses theinquiry on objectively identifiable attributes of a substance and(b)provides a sound basis by which to distinguish addictive drugs fromother substances (and activities) that people find pleasurable and may at somepoint find somewhat difficult to forgo. [38]]<h5>(i)	  Intoxication</h5>	Nicotine in cigarette smoke does not produce intoxication.  As Dr.Jaffehas written, "[t]he emphasis placed... on the concept of drug`intoxication' rather than on a more morally-neutral term such as `reinforcingeffects' of the drug should not be seen as either arbitrary or moralistic.""fn84"  [39  In fact, intoxication (or psychotoxicity)is a key element in determining the extent to which a substance is"addictive."40  Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, and alcohol all induceintoxication and potentially are psychotoxic.41  By contrast, cigarette smokingis not associated with intoxication, much less psychotoxicity.42  <p>	Intoxication leads to loss of self-controland disruption of reasoning and perception.  As acknowledged in DSM-III-R,however, "nicotine, unlike alcohol, rarely causes any clinically significantstate of intoxication [and] there is no impairment in social or occupationalfunctioning as an immediate and direct consequence of its use."43  Indeed,DSM-IV, published in May 1994, identifies eleven classes of substances in itschapter on "substance related disorders," from caffeine to opioids;]every one of the eleven classes, except nicotine, is listed as anintoxicant.44  <p>	In response to the question-- "Are tobacco smokers frequently unable tofulfill major role obligations because of nicotine intoxication or withdrawalsymptoms?"-- Dr.Jaffe similarly wrote in 1990,<p>"If there are such smokers they are exceedingly rare....[W]hen compared with the impairment of role obligations produced by alcohol (orother forms of drug) intoxication and withdrawal, the role impairmentattributable to tobacco dependence per se is minimal.""fn90"  [45  <p><p>	Even FDA admits that "role impairment" attributable to smoking is minimal.46In contrast, chronic use of addictive substances leads to significantdisruption of personal, financial and social relationships.  These behavioraleffects of chronic intoxication are a principal characteristic of drugaddiction.  <p>	The fact that nicotine does not produce any meaningful intoxication is thus acritical distinction between it and drugs such as heroin, cocaine and alcohol.As Dr.Jaffe has noted,<p>"while nicotine is psychoactive, ]it is not a drug which reliablyproduces the kinds of euphoria and mood alteration typical of other drugs ofabuse.  Nor do tobacco users seek such mood alterations from either tobaccoproducts or nicotine preparations used in treating tobacco dependence.  In thissense, the `absence of psychotoxicity' is not an irrational basis forconsidering tobacco (nicotine) dependence as somewhat distinct from other formsof drug dependence." [47]  <p>]<h5>(ii)	  Physical Dependence/Withdrawal Syndrome</h5>	Physical dependence, as characterized by a well-defined withdrawal (orabstinence) syndrome, is the second key element of most scientific definitionsof "addiction." [48]  Substances that inducephysical dependence, such as opiates, alcohol and barbiturates, are allassociated with powerful withdrawal syndromes.  Indeed, withdrawal from alcoholand barbiturates can be fatal.  By contrast, abstinence effects associated withsmoking are mild, subjective "symptoms" that are not comparable to the signsand symptoms of withdrawal caused by the removal of substances inducingphysical dependence.49  <p>	Although some smokers may experience discomfort upon cessation and may find itdifficult to remain abstinent, "[t]here is no substantial evidence to suggestthat nicotine can cause physical dependence...."50  Indeed,<p>"it is clear that many people become regular smokers without apparentlydeveloping a strong dependence uponnicotine and are able to quit thehabit without much difficulty....  Thus, any hypothesisproposed to explain the role of nicotine in the tobacco-smoking habit must takeaccount of this fact."51<p><p>	Dr.Daniel Horn, a well-known smoking and health researcher who conductedmany studies for the American Cancer Society, put the issue of "withdrawal"into perspective: "I deplore those who characterize quitting smoking as atortured, almost impossible process.  ]For many people, it is easy; formost it is somewhere between easy and difficult; and only for a minority is itreally difficult." [52]<p>	As even Dr.Jack Henningfield, a well-known anti-smoking critic, hasstated, the "clinical aspects of the [tobacco withdrawal] syndrome are]very mild compared to those which may accompany abstinence fromopioids, sedatives, and alcohol in compulsive users of these drugs.""fn112"  [53  Similarly, Dr.Balfour has written:<p>"In the case of drugs, such as the opiates or the barbiturates, which causephysical dependence, the abstinence syndrome can be severe and even life-threatening.... There is no evidence, however, that nicotine evokes a withdrawal effect ofthis type, and nicotine dependence appears to be predominantly psychological innature."54<p><p>	In a 1990 review, Drs.Hughes, Higgins and Hatsukami likewise concludedthat "abstinence from tobacco has not been shown to cause specific physicalsymptoms ]as in other withdrawal syndromes.""fn129"  [55  This "withdrawal" is thus hardlysubstantial.  According to ]Goth's Medical Pharmacology,"[w]ithdrawal from nicotine may produce impatience, irritability, anxiety,restlessness, headache, insomnia, and decreased cognitive abilities.  Thesesymptoms vary with the individual user and do not constitute a definedabstinence syndrome." [56]  As stated in a1994 article, "[d]espite recent empirical attention, uncertainty regarding themanifestations of nicotine withdrawal continues. . . ."57 <p>	Further, whether the abstinence effects that are associated with smokingrepresent a "nicotine withdrawal syndrome" is unclear.  Drs.Hughes,Higgins, and Hatsukami concluded that "[f]or many of the proposed abstinenceeffects, there are few empirical data that fit minimal scientificcriteria...."58  As stated in DSM-III-R:"In anygiven case it is difficult to distinguish a withdrawal effect from theemergence of psychological traits that were suppressed, controlled, or alteredby the effects of nicotine ]or from a behavioral reaction (e.g.,frustration) to the loss of a reinforcer.""fn139"  [59  <p>	Drs.Hughes, Higgins, and Hatsukami similarly noted that, "anxiety" and"restlessness"-- often cited as "major withdrawal symptoms"-- areonly "transiently" increased and, even then, "][w]hether this is due tonicotine deprivation is unclear" or "debatable.""fn139"  [60  As Martin Jarvis of the Imperial CancerResearch Fund Health Center (U.K.) has stated, the manifestation of "anxiety"and "restlessness" associated with cessation in some smokers "is mainly interms of self report of affective state rather than more somatic signs such astremors or palpitations."61  Indeed, as a recent study concluded, the symptomsof nicotine "withdrawal" are "similar enough to be confused" with symptoms of"caffeine withdrawal."62  By contrast, there is little ambiguity about thenature or cause of the withdrawal syndromes associated with cessation ofclassically addicting substances, such as barbiturates and alcohol.    <p>	Craving is often cited as the most significant "nicotine withdrawal symptom."Indeed, for many years, the hallmark of purported nicotine withdrawal -- and byimplication of tobacco "dependence"-- was "craving."  Researchers havestated that craving (]i.e., "thinking about smoking or wishto smoke") was "the most severe symptom of cigarette withdrawal.""fn148"  [63<p>	However, the desire to continue a pleasurable behavior one has engaged in formany years can hardly be considered "withdrawal" or an indicator of"dependence."  If that were the case, foregoing any pleasurable activity wouldcreate "withdrawal."  Thus, "craving" as a definition of dependence is neithermedically significant nor scientifically sound.  Indeed, "craving" was removedfrom the list of diagnostic criteria for "nicotine withdrawal" in DSM-IV.64  <p>	Moreover, researchers have noted that nicotine may not be the primary factorcausing "craving" or the desire to smoke:<p>"[T]he desire to smoke may be more dependent on circumstances, settings,activities, and emotions associated with persons smoking than on blood nicotinelevels."65<p><p>Other researchers have similarly concluded that "craving" is "not strictlybound to nicotine intake.  The subjective perception of `craving' [is] perhapsrather a craving for the habituated behavior than fornicotine."66]<p>	In any event, "[a]bstinence effects have yet to be clearly shown to beimportant in the maintenance or cessation of smoking.""fn163"  [67  As Dr.Hughes has stated, thisobservation is contrary to a nicotine dependence theory of smoking:  <p>"A major hypothesis of the nicotine dependence theory is that nicotinewithdrawal prevents abstinence.  If this is true, then subjects with moresevere withdrawal should have a greater probability of relapse.  Although someearlier trials have not confirmed this relationship, other trials have.  Therobustness and consistency of the predictive power of withdrawal variessubstantially across these studies and across follow-ups within the studies.It was hoped that the larger and more heterogeneous sample would more likelydetect a withdrawal-abstinencerelationship; ]however, none of the valid withdrawal symptomsconsistently predicted outcome." [68]<p><p>	Other studies have likewise found that "nicotine withdrawal" plays little orno role in relapse.69  Indeed, some researchers havefounda]negative relationship between withdrawal and relapse."fn174"  [70<p>	Thus, despite the extensive research conducted to date, there are many factsthat suggest that the so-called tobacco (or nicotine) withdrawal syndrome isnot the result of nicotine "withdrawal."  As Dr.Jaffe noted in 1990:<p>"Several aspects of the tobacco withdrawal syndrome are not yet fullyexplained.  ]Firstly, why is there such an inconsistent relationshipbetween apparent tobacco intake and the severity of the syndrome?Secondly, why is there such variability between individuals in themanifestations of withdrawal?  Thirdly, why has it sometimes been sodifficult to reduce craving for cigarette smoke (as opposed to other symptoms)with nicotine itself?  Fourthly, what explains the great variability induration of withdrawal symptomatology?  Fifthly, why is the severity oftobacco withdrawal a weak predictor of successful long-term abstinence?""fn175"  [71]<p><h5>(iii)	  Tolerance</h5>	In addition to intoxication and a physical withdrawal syndrome, anothercomponent of the traditional scientific definition of "addiction" is thephenomenon of tolerance.  For purposes of determining whether a substance is"addictive," it is critical to distinguish between two different types of"tolerance" that may be associated with substance use.  First, the userof a substance can develop "tolerance" to the unpleasant characteristicsassociated with the substance when first used.  In this regard, "tolerance"means that the user "gets used to" or "adapts to" the negative or aversiveproperties of the substance.  Second, and more importantly from thestandpoint of the traditional definition of "addiction," the user of asubstance may find that, over time, markedly increased amounts of the substanceare necessary to achieve a desired effect from the substance(e.g., intoxication):<p>"Tolerance is a phenomenon in which prior exposure to a drug decreases theresponse to a given dose; thus more drug is necessary to produce the desiredeffect." [72]<p><p>	In this regard, tolerance is said to develop to the subjective (orreinforcing) effects of the substance.  For example, a desire to experience theeffects of opiates or alcohol can, owing to the effects of tolerance, lead theuser to dramatic increases in dose levels over time.  It is this second form oftolerance that is pertinent in identifying "addictive" substances.<p>	By blurring the critical distinction between the two uses of the term, someresearchers have argued that smoking induces "tolerance."  The facts, however,simply do not support such claims.  To be sure, a first-time smoker may quicklydevelop a "tolerance" to the ]aversive effects of tobacco(e.g., nausea and throat irritation, which some new smokersexperience). [73]  However, "tolerance," asused to define drug "addiction"-- that is, the need for ever-increasingamounts to achieve a ]desired effect-- does not developin smokers:<p>"If tolerance developed for those effects of smoking which are important forsmoking motivation, one would expect an escalating dose along a smoking career.In fact, smoking intensity seems to be lower rather than higher among smokerswith a longer career." [74]<p><p>	The need for a precise use of the term "tolerance" in discussing smokingbehavior was emphasized by Professor Gray during a 1990 symposium onnicotine:<p>"I am worried about the way the word `tolerance' has been thrown around,particularly in the context of the overall theme of this meeting, nicotinedependence.  There is a general view that dependence on a drug is very closelyrelated to the development of tolerance to the drug.  This may be true in somecases.  ]My worry is that it's been taken for granted that nicotineinduces general tolerance.  There are lots of reasons to think that's nottrue.  I am pretty certain that in nicotine self-administration experimentswith animals there is little evidence that the dose that animals choose toself-administer increases during the experiment, except perhaps during a veryearly period.  The human smoker reaches their two pack-a-day stage, orwhatever, then stays there for many years.""fn185"  [75]<i></i><p><i></i><p>Similarly, in 1990 Dr.West wrote:<p>"Very little systematic data have been collected to address the issues of acuteand chronic tolerance to nicotine's subjective effects....From the very patchy data so far obtained, it seems unlikely that a simplechronic tolerance model for causation of withdrawal symptoms such as cravingwill suffice." [76]<p><p>Dr.West's comment is consistent with the general observation that thedaily consumption of cigarettes by a given smoker usually remains constant ortends to decrease throughout the smoker's lifetime.77<p>	*   *   *<p>	In sum, when viewed according to the traditional scientific definition of"addiction"-- which requires clear evidence that a substance can producemeaningful intoxication, withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, and tolerancerequiring ever-increasing doses to achieve a ]desired effect--neither smoking nor nicotine fits the classic definition.<h4>d.		Self-AdministrationStudies Do Not</h4><b>			Establish That Nicotine Is Similar</b><p>			<b>to AddictiveDrugs&nbp;</b><p><p>	FDA claims that nicotine's ability to "control behavior" isdemonstrated by its reinforcing effects. [78]Indeed, FDA contends that positive reinforcement (as measured by self-administrationstudies) is "the most important hallmark of an addictive substance."79  If thatwere the case, however, many substances -- and activities -- would be"addictive."  In fact, although addictive substances may all be reinforcing,the converse is not true:  Many commonly-used substances and activities act asreinforcers, but are not "addictive" and do not "induce[ ] continued,compulsive use."80  <p>	Indeed, virtually all substances and activities that provide pleasure tohumans can be reinforcing to some degree:  Humans seek repetition of pleasantexperiences.  Among the substances and activities described in the scientificliterature as "reinforcing" are caffeine, computer games, exercise, food,money, nail-biting,running, sugar, and watching television.81  <p>	Thus, as reported by one researcher in 1991:<p>"the results of self-administrationstudies should not be used alone for evaluating abuse potential.  ]Anumber of drugs which probably possess minimal or no abuse potential have beenshown to function as reinforcers in preclinical drug self-administrationstudies." [82]  <p><p>	FDA ignores evidence-- some of which comes from the very studies theAgency cites-- that reveals clear differences between the reinforcingeffects of nicotine and those of addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine.Indeed, the Agency ignores evidence that shows nicotine to be a weak reinforcermuch like caffeine.  Finally, none of the studies cited by FDA establishes thatnicotine's pharmacological effects are "substantial" or that people smoke"nearly exclusively," or even primarily, for the pharmacological effects ofnicotine.83]<h5>(i)	  Animal Self-AdministrationStudies</h5><p>	FDA argues that one of the "fundamental commonalities" in "(s)ubstances thatcan produce compulsive drug-seekingand drug-taking behavior in humans" is that "they are voluntarilyself-administered by non-humanmammals." [84]  The fact that laboratoryanimals can be conditioned to self-administer nicotine, however, does not meanthat nicotine is "addictive" in humans.  As one researcher put it,<p>"It should be clear that the proposition, that the drugs that serve asreinforcers in animals are abused by humans, is greatly oversimplified."85  <p><p>	In addition to sugar, water and food, animals have been reported to self-administermany substances which are not considered "addictive."  For example, oneresearcher reports that some analgesic and antidepressant drugs(]e.g., nalbuphine, butorphanol, nomifensine, bupropion) arereinforcing in tests on laboratory animals, but do not result in abuse problemsin humans. [86]  Animals will alsoself-administer caffeine and saccharin.87  Under certain test conditions,monkeys will even self-administer electric shocks.88  No one, however,seriously argues that electric shocks are "addictive."89<p>	Furthermore, different strains of the same species of laboratory animalsdisplay markedly different reinforcement responses to the same substance.Several mouse and rat strains are used experimentally precisely because of thegenetic differences in their willingness to administer a substance.90  Studiesof reinforcement using such animals may not accurately reflect reinforcementamong animals generally-- let alone in humans.<p>	Finally, contrary to the Agency's recent "analysis," nicotine is at most aweak reinforcer.91  In fact, it is very difficult to demonstrate any positivereinforcing effects of nicotine in laboratory animals.92  As stated in onerecent study ]cited by FDA, "nicotine is known to possessreinforcing effect and the effect is substantially weaker than that of theprincipal drugs of abuse such as opiates or cocaine.""fn254"  [93  Other researchers reached similarconclusions in 1991:  "The reinforcing properties of nicotine in intravenousself-administrationis generally weaker than those of opiates, stimulants, and sedative-hypnoticdrugs."94  <p>	In fact, experts recognize that special requirements are necessary to]train animals to self-administer nicotine.  Long periods oftraining are required, and even then response rates are quite low."fn258"  [95  For example, FDA relies on a 1981 articleby Goldberg ]et al. in which the authors reported thatsquirrel monkeys self-administered nicotine.  As FDA acknowledges, however, theself-administrationwas significant only when a visual stimulus was present:"fn261"  [96  "Squirrel monkeys trained under second-orderschedules responded to a visual stimulus (light) that was intermittentlyassociated with nicotine injection."97  Goldberg was ]unable toobtain an increase in self-administration above that of saline when nicotinewas administered without the visual stimuli. <p>	Thus, as one recent study stated, nicotine<p>"may be considered to be, at best, a weak reinforcing agent that, incontrast to other abused drugs, maintains self-injectionbehavior only under a well-controlledadministration regimen." [98]<p><p>	Even Dr.Henningfield-- perhaps the leading proponent of the"nicotine addiction" hypothesis-- has conceded that<p>"nicotine serves as a reinforcer under a more limited range of conditions thando other reinforcers and that its strength is more related to environmentalstimuli than is the case for other drugs of abuse."99<p><p>	In contrast, heroin and cocaine function as positive reinforcers under a broadrange of conditions, and in a host of species.100  Indeed, merely placing atrained laboratory animal in an experimental box and providing an injectionlever will lead to self-administration of cocaine.101  <p>	It is clear that nicotine's reinforcing efficacy is more like that of caffeinethan that of addictive drugs.  After attempting to obtain self-administrationof caffeine in animals, one researcher noted this similarity:<p>"However, the inconsistent results across animals and studies contrast with theresults reported with the classic abused stimulants (e.g., amphetamine andcocaine) that have more consistently been shown to maintain intravenous selfinjection across a wide range of species and conditions.  ]The variationin results with caffeine is analogous to that reported in self-injectionstudies with nicotine: Nicotine has not reliably maintained self-injectionacross animals and studies.  It has been concluded that although nicotine canserve as a reinforcer, it does so under a more limited range of conditions thando drugs such as cocaine.  A similar conclusion seems warranted forcaffeine." [102]<p><p>	In sum, the "reinforcing" effects of nicotine-- as established by animalstudies-- are neither substantial nor proof of nicotine "addiction." ]<h5>(ii)	  Human Self-Administration Studies</h5>	Although FDA cites several studies under the heading "self-administration inhumans," [103] only one of the studies isactually a self-administration study.  The remaining studies cited by FDAconcern the phenomenon of "compensation."  As discussed below, compensationstudies do not establish that humans "self-administer" nicotine -- and they donot prove that people smoke "nearly exclusively," or even primarily, for theeffects of nicotine or to maintain nicotine blood levels.  Indeed, as discussedmore fully in Section E below, compensation, if it occurs at all, is only ashort-termphenomenon.  As Drs. Henningfield and Benowitz -- two leading proponents of FDAregulation -- have stated:  <p>"Overcompensation (]i.e., inhaling more smoke fromlow-nicotine cigarettes than from higher-yield brands) appears, however, topersist only for days or weeks." [104]  <p><p>This is not consistent with the hypothesis that people smoke (or "self-administer")cigarettes to maintain nicotine blood levels.<p>	The sole human self-administrationstudy cited by FDA is a 1983 study by Henningfield, ]etal.105  The conclusions drawn from this study, however, are questionableand clearly do not provide evidence that nicotine has a substantial effect onthe structure or function of the body or that smokers smoke "nearlyexclusively" for the effects of nicotine.  <p>	First, the study was extremely small: only six subjectsparticipated.  Moreover, four of the six subjects had "histories of drug abuseof a variety of drugs, including opioids, stimulants, and sedatives.""fn282"  [106  As one researcher correctly pointed out,conclusions drawn from such samples cannot be applied to the generalpopulation.107<p>	Dr. Domenic Ciraulo, Professor at Tufts University School of Medicine,testified before the FDA's Drug Abuse Advisory Committee ("DAAC") about thisstudy and noted that, in general, "drug experienced subjects react differentlythan drug naive patients....  [D]rug abusers may actuallyself-administer the drug more than non-drugabusers."108  Indeed, self-administration of nicotine by such subjects maysimply reflect the subjects' preference for any pharmacological stimulus -- nomatter how mild -- over no stimulus at all.  In fact, the subjects in thisstudy also self-administered saline, which suggests that the subjects wereconditioned to perform the act of "self-administration"regardless of the substance being delivered.109  <p>	]Second, the dose and route of administration were not comparableto, and therefore cannot be representative of, cigarette smoking.  Moreover,the amount of nicotine delivered to the subjects in the i.v. solution was 0.75,1.5, or 3mg in a single 10-second infusion."fn289"  [110  Thus, each time the subjects"administered" the i.v. solution, they received -- in 10seconds -- theentire nicotine yield of between one and three cigarettes.  <p>	Further, although the researchers claimed to establish self-administrationat the 1.5mg dose, they did not report the data for the 0.75mgdose.  This suggests that self-administrationwas not significant at this level.  Finally, even Henningfield noted the lessthan robust results of this study in a subsequent article:  The "number ofnicotine injections ]generally exceeded numbers of salineinjections." [111] <p>	Thus, this single study consisting of only six subjects (four of whom had ahistory of drug abuse) and using abnormal routes of  administration of nicotinein concentrated doses does not establish that smokers smoke cigarettes to "self-administer"nicotine --and certainly does not establish that nicotine in commercial cigarettes has"substantial" effects on the structure or function of the body.]<h4>e.		"Drug Discrimination" Studies and "Liking"/</h4><b>			"Subjective Effects" Studies Do Not</b><p><b>			Establish That Nicotine Is Similar to</b><p>			<b>AddictiveDrugs&nbp;</b><p><p>	FDA claims that "[t]he ability of a substance to produce discriminativestimulus effects is one characteristic of an addictive substance.""fn291"  [112  That may be true, but most substancesthat produce "discriminative" stimulus effects are ]not addictive.In fact, the purpose of a drug "discrimination" study is merely to demonstratethat the test subject "recognizes" or "identifies" a substance that has beenadministered to the subject.  As stated by Bigelow and Preston in 1989:<p>"[I]t must be emphasized that drug discrimination procedures assess thestimulus properties of drugs, not their reinforcing properties.  These are notnecessarily the same thing; drugs with similar stimulus properties may havediffering reinforcing effects, just as drugs with differing stimulus propertiesmay have similar reinforcing effects.  Thus, the aspect of the drug stimuluscomplex that individuals use to learn a drug discrimination is not necessarilythe same as the aspect(s) of drug effects related to abuse liability.""fn291"  [113 <p>]<h5>(i)	  Human Drug Discrimination Studies</h5>	The human "discrimination" studies cited by FDA do not support the Agency'sclaim that nicotine is similar to cocaine, heroin, or other drugs of abuse.For example, the results of the Kallman study discussed by FDA do not suggestthat nicotine has significant "discriminative" properties in humans."fn293"  [114  In that study, the 22 subjects weresmokers who smoked at least a pack of cigarettes per day and had smokinghistories ranging from six to 30 years.115  The subjects were "trained" tocompare the subjective effects of two pairs of cigarettes:  (1) cigarettes withnicotine yields of 0.69 mg and 0.18mg, respectively; and(2)cigarettes with nicotine yields of 1.3 mg and 0.14 mg, respectively.<p>	The researchers reported that the subjects could not distinguish between thecigarettes in the first pair, but that there was significant "discrimination"between the cigarettes in the second pair.116  This is hardly surprising giventhe wide disparity between the nicotine yields of the cigarettes in the secondpair and nicotine's significant contribution to the flavor of cigarettesmoke.117  However, even with this pair, some of the subjects were not able todiscriminate between the two cigarettes until after four or more "training"sessions.118  Further, Kallman ]et al. did notconclude that the central nervous system effect of nicotine was responsible forthe apparent "discrimination."  In fact, the researchers stated, "[i]t is notclear at this point what cues the subjects used to make theirdiscriminations." [119] <p>	Similarly, the results of the Perkins study provide no support for FDA'sconclusion.120  That study consisted of only 18 subjects, all of whom weresmokers.  The subjects were able to distinguish 2 ug/kg of nicotine fromplacebo in a nasal spray.121  However, as FDA reports, "identification" ofnicotine was reported by only 50percent of only the male subjects.122]A fifty percent response in a 2-choice discrimination test is exactlywhat would be predicted by random chance.  In other words, a50percent correct response would be expected even if the subjects simplyguessed.  Moreover, as FDA acknowledged, female subjects correctly "identified"nicotine only 30percent of the time.123  This demonstrates alack of discriminability for females.  Such weak data do not prove thatnicotine has "discriminative stimulus effects" -- much less that nicotine has"substantial" pharmacological effects.  Further, any observed effect could havebeen due to odor and trigeminal responses in the nose.<p>	Third, FDA also cites a study by Goldfarb, et al.124This study is not a "discrimination" study.  The researchers merely providedsubjects with experimental cigarettes with varying yields of nicotine and hadthe subjects "rate" the cigarettes in terms of "strength" and "satisfaction."The researchers concluded that "strength" increased as nicotine yieldsincreased and that this increase was independent of "tar."  But the smokersoften rated their usual commercial brand of cigarette as "stronger" thanexperimental or test cigarettes-- even when the test cigarettes yieldedmore nicotine than the subjects' normal brand."fn307"  [125<p>	Moreover, "satisfaction" ratings were ]not related to nicotineyield at all. [126]  The researchers concludedthat the subjects' higher "satisfaction" ratings for their usual brands may"have been associated with the different commercial packaging and `brandimages' of the cigarettes used."127  Of course, this is not a nicotine-relatedreason for smoking satisfaction.128  <p>	In addition to the "discrimination" studies, FDA discusses a number of studiesthat evaluated the "subjective effects of nicotine."129  It is well-known thatnicotine contributes significantly to the subjective (i.e., flavor)characteristics of cigarette smoke, and we have addressed this issue below.130FDA claims, however, that the subjective effects of nicotine are "similar tothose of other addicting drugs" and that nicotine is "a euphoriant similar tococaine or amphetamine."131  These claims are not supported by anything otherthan a handful of studies that use inaccurate methods to compare the subjectiveeffects of nicotine with those of addictive drugs. <p>	For example, FDA relies heavily upon a 1985 article by Henningfield]et al. in which the researchers use the Morphine-BenzedrineGroup scale ("the MBG scale" or "euphoria scale") and the Single DoseQuestionnaire ("the Liking Scale") [132] todetermine the subjective effects of intravenous nicotine and inhalednicotine.133  The study consisted of only eight subjects who had smoked for atleast seven years, who smoked from 11/2 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day, andwho had "histories of drug abuse."134  Obviously, whatever the subjectiveeffects reported by this group, they do not represent a true measure ofnicotine's subjective effects in the general population.<p>	The subjects received three doses of intravenous nicotine (0.75, 1.5, and 3.0mg) in 10 second infusions and inhaled nicotine from "research cigarettes" with"estimated" nicotine yields of 0.4, 1.4, and 2.9 mg.135  ]Theresearchers, themselves, conceded that inhaled nicotine did not produce asignificant increase in the MBG "euphoria" score.  "Euphoria" scores were"only significantly changed when nicotine was given via the[intravenous] route....""fn317"  [136<p>	The fact that some subjects reported a "euphoric" effect for]intravenous nicotine-- delivered in a period of 10 secondsand in doses comparable to, and perhaps greater than, the entire yield of oneto three cigarettes-- cannot be applied to smokers (or smoking) ingeneral.  As Dr. Ciraulo testified before the DAAC, "the largest increase in[the] euphoria [scale in the 1985 Henningfield study] is from the i.v. 3 mgbolus, which even Russell suggests is a very high dose to administerintravenously." [137]  <p>	Further, as stated above, the subjects had histories of "drug abuse."  The"euphoric" effect of receiving intravenous nicotine-- or any othersubstance-- may have been the result of the subjects' "expectancy" thatthey were receiving ]some substance via injection.  In fact, drugusers have reported physiological responses following injections of inactivesubstances, such as sterile saline. [138]Indeed, drug abusers may experience drug-like responses simply by]seeing a drug-takingapparatus. [139]<p>	Moreover, the reported increase in the MBG scale in this study was no moresignificant than the effect of caffeine on the same scale and at doses that are]not artificially high.  As Dr.Ciraulo testified before theDAAC, a 100 mg dose of caffeine--the amount of caffeine inapproximately one cup of coffee--has produced changes in euphoriascores "greater even than this [3 mg] i.v. bolus of nicotine.""fn322"  [140  Even gambling has produced "significantlyelevated scores" on the MBG scale.141<p>	Finally, the raw data from this study indicate that the significant "euphoric"effect reported for intravenous nicotine was actually derived by the extremescores of only two subjects.142  ]The remaining five subjects did notfind intravenous nicotine significantly euphoric at any dose.  The resultsof this study thus show that even using artificial methods of administration atartifically high doses-- far in excess of the levels of nicotine incigarette smoke-- nicotine does not cause a "euphoric" response.<p>	The researchers-- and FDA-- also state that seven subjects in thisstudy "identified" nicotine as "cocaine" or "amphetamine.""fn333"  [143  The fact that seven smokers withhistories of drug abuse described intravenous nicotine at abnormally high dosesas either "cocaine" or "amphetamine" is absolutely irrelevant to FDA'sassertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes.  ]Indeed, these same subjectsoccasionally identified the placebo as cocaine or amphetamine.144  <p>	The researchers also reported that, in addition to the MBG scores, the "LikingScale" scores reported by the eight subjects "were significantly increased bynicotine given via both routes [inhalation and intravenous].""fn335"  [145  The use of the "Liking Scale" tocategorize nicotine with addictive drugs is deceptive.  As Dr.Cirauloexplained to the DAAC:<p>"This is a liking scale: `My liking for the drug is most nearly described bywhich of the following:  not at all; slight; moderate; a lot; an awful lot.'<p><p>"In the absence of a major change in...euphoria score,or some other intoxicating, highly-reinforcingdrug effect, ]this scale means nothing.  If a person has a headacheand takes aspirin, gets relief from the pain, and then answers this question, Ithink [he] would probably answer it: `an awful lot'.""fn337"  [146<p><p>	Even Dr. Henningfield has recognized that an increase in the Liking Scale, byitself, is not determinative of the "addiction potential" of a substance.147Thus, the 1985 Henningfield study -- which showed an increase in MGB euphoriaonly when nicotine was delivered in an artificial manner and at artificialdoses -- does not support FDA's claims that nicotine is "addictive" or thatpeople smoke primarily to maintain blood nicotine levels.  Indeed, according tothe Addiction Research Center criteria, inhaled nicotine does not havepotential "abuse liability" because it did not produce significant increases inthe MBG scale.<p>	In any event, even if liking scale increases were enough to establish the"addictive potential" of a substance, the results of this study would not bemeaningful.  As noted above, the subjects were all heavy smokers -- smoking11/2 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day for at least seven years.  Moreover, the"subjects were deprived of tobacco...for at least 9hours before testing."148  That these smokers indicated that they "liked"cigarettes is not surprising. <p>	Further, the test cigarettes used in this study were reported to yield"]about 29 to 35mg of tar.""fn344"  [149  Any "subjective effects" may have beenthe result of these substantial "tar" yields.  Thus, the conclusions of theresearchers that "[n]icotine produced generally similar effects whether givenby the i.v. or IH [inhaled] route" does not reflect actual smoking experiencesor take into account the subjective effects of "tar."150<p>	Indeed, a 1994 study (not cited by FDA) that was conducted by NIDAresearchers, including Dr. Henningfield, compared the "liking" scores of anicotine-containingcigarette with a de-nicotinizedcigarette.151  The researchers found that both de-nicotinized and standardcigarettes caused increases in "liking."  In fact, the mean "liking" score forthe nicotine-yieldingcigarettes at the highest nicotine-yield level and for the de-nicotinizedcigarettes were virtually identical:  2.8 and 2.4, respectively.  Clearly,"liking scores" are affected by factors other than nicotine yields.  <p>	In sum, as Dr.Jaffe recently stated, there are "serious questions aboutthe laboratory data purporting to show that nicotine induces euphoria similarto that which is induced by central stimulants such as cocaine."152  Again, FDAis wrong.]<h5>(ii)	  Animal Drug Discrimination Studies</h5>	Animal "discrimination" studies similarly provide no support for FDA's claims.Quite simply, the mere fact that, under certain circumstances, laboratoryanimals can be trained to "discriminate" or "distinguish" nicotine does notestablish that people smoke cigarettes for the effects of nicotine or thatnicotine has a substantial effect on the structure or function of the body.Indeed, many common substances, such as caffeine, have "discriminative stimulusproperties." [153]  Instead, these studiesmerely demonstrate the obvious: that an animal can be trained to react to acue.<p>	Typically, animal "drug discrimination" studies consist of a two-lever operantdiscrimination task:  Laboratory animals are trained to press a specific leverand are then trained to respond based on whether the injection contains the"drug" or a placebo.<p>	It is not surprising that laboratory animals have been able to "discriminate"nicotine in the studies cited by FDA.  In these studies, researchers usedamounts of nicotine that, in proportion to human smokers, vastly exceed thenicotine yields in commercial cigarettes.  For example, Pratt ]etal. trained rats to discriminate nicotine from saline with a .4 mg/kginjection of nicotine. [154]  This amount ofnicotine would be the rough equivalent of giving a 150 pound human a 27 mginjection of nicotine.  That is equivalent to receiving the yield of over apack of standard cigarettes in a single injection.  Clearly, using such a highdosage renders the results of such studies inapplicable to the smokingpopulation.  In spite of this fact, "[n]early all studies of the discriminativeeffects of nicotine utilizing operant conditioning have used 0.4 mg/kg as thetraining dose."155  <p>	The FDA also claims that these animal studies show that  discriminativeproperties of nicotine have "some" similarities with those of amphetamine andcocaine.156  Unable to resist this comparison, the Agency ignores conclusionsof some of the very articles it cites.  For example, Pratt ]etal. reported, "[a]lthough nicotine is considered a central stimulant,neither cocaine nor amphetamine generalized with nicotine.""fn362"  [157  Chance ]et al. agreed,saying, "[t]ests of the generalization of the nicotine stimuli to various dosesof amphetamine indicate that the rats did not perceive these two drugs asthe same." [158]<h4>f.		Epidemiological Data Do Not Establish</h4>			<b>That Nicotine Is"Addictive"</b><p><p>	FDA claims that "[p]opulation studies" establish that smokers"[d]isplay the [c]linical [s]ymptoms of [a]ddiction.""fn370"  [159  The Agency argues that statistics showingthat some smokers exhibit some of the purported "symptoms" of addiction supportthe hypothesis that nicotine is addictive.160  As made clear in SectionCbelow, the data relied upon by FDA do not establish that nicotine is"addictive."]<h4>g.		FDA'S DAAC Did Not Conclude Unanimously</h4>			<b>That Nicotine Is"Addictive"</u</b><p><p>	In its Jurisdictional Analysis, the Agency mischaracterizes theconclusions of its own Drug Abuse Advisory Committee ("DAAC"), which wasconvened on August2, 1994 to consider issues relating to tobacco andnicotine.  The Committee's deliberations show that, contrary to the positionnow taken by the Agency, the role of nicotine in smoking behavior is notsettled.<p>	On August2, 1994, the DAAC held a hearing "to assure the scientificunderpinnings...[of FDA's decision] whether to regulatenicotine-containing cigarettes as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug andCosmetic Act." [161]  Despite the overwhelmingbias in the proceedings towards the Commissioner's position,162 the Committeereached the following conclusions: (1)The Committee did not have adequatetime to consider fully the issues presented to it.  (2)One member did notbelieve that there were enough data to conclude that nicotine is "addictive".(3)The entire Committee stated that there were not enough data todetermine any threshold dose of nicotine that will or will not produce"addiction".163<p>	Specifically, the Committee was asked to respond to the question "Arecigarettes and other forms of tobacco addicting?"164  One member of theCommittee, Dr.Lawrence Brown, the senior vice president at the AddictionResearch and Treatment Corporation and assistant clinical professor of medicineat Harlem and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, declined to findthat nicotine was "addictive."165<p>	The Advisory Committee was also asked whether "addiction to cigarettes andother tobacco products is ]substantially due to the pharmacologicaleffects of nicotine on the human body?""fn380"  [166  Again, the Committee did not consider theanswer to be simple, and the vote was not unanimous:  <p>"I think nicotine is an important component of the development of dependenceuse patterns in tobacco products, ]but I don't want to divert attentionfrom behavioral and other factors that influence use as well.""fn381"  [167<p><p>	*     *     *<p><p>"]Essentially, if in fact nicotine were the sole agent producingdependence, then simply replacing it would solve the problem of the addiction,and it does not." [168]<p><p>	*     *     *<p><p>"To be consistent with my comments and my response to Item No.1, I mustagain comment, and the reason why I do this is that, I guess]underscoring the issue of my scientific judgment, and using thescientific method and being able to exclude all other factors and otheringredients in tobacco, I would then still have to say that it is suggestiveand not `is.'" [169]<p><p>	Thus, even members of FDA's own hand-picked Advisory Committee recognized thatpeople smoke for reasons other than the pharmacological effects ofnicotine.]<h3>2.	 	The Pharmacological Effects of Nicotine</h3>		<b>Are NotSubstantial&nbp;</b><p><p>	Naturally-occurring compounds in many products (e.g., caffeinein coffee, theobromine in chocolate) affect the structure or function of thebody in that they affect the central nervous system.  <p>Indeed, every substance and activity that provokes an emotion -- be it pleasantor unpleasant -- induces a "pharmacological" or "psychoactive" effect.Caffeine, carrots, chocolate, computer games, food generally, slot machines,hot chili peppers, Nutrasweet, pinball machines, sugar, television, and whiteflour have all been described in the scientific and professional literature ashaving such an effect.[17]0  The literaturealso ascribes similar effects to exercise, fast driving, fundamentalism,gambling, running, shopping, and work.171<p>	In contrast, a clear marker of a ]substantial pharmacologicaleffect is intoxication.  As noted by the National Institute of Drug Abuse("NIDA") in its 1984 First Triennial Report to Congress, <p>"[a] predictable effect of the use of almost any psychoactive drug is adistortion of the perception of time, space, and the location of objects withinspace.  A corollary effect is a dose-relatedreduction in physical coordination or psychomotor functioning.""fn412"  [172<p><p>	The scientific literature demonstrates that nicotine simply does not causethis type of effect.  As discussed in detail above,173 and as made clearrecently by Dr.Jaffe, "unlike most other drugs associated withdependence, [nicotine] has the distinction of not producing any]substantial degree of intoxication."[174<p>	In what appears to be an effort to show that nicotine has a significant effecton the function or structure of the body despite this acknowledged absence ofintoxication, FDA cites studies that find that nicotine "produces its rewardingor reinforcing effects by stimulating the release of dopamine, a chemicalproduced in the mesolimbic system."175  That a substance or activity may beassociated with the mesolimbic system and the release of dopamine, however,does not establish that the substance has a ]substantialpharmacological effect, is intoxicating, or is "addictive."[176  <p>	Indeed, as one researcher has noted, "the regulation ]of food andwater intake has an important dopaminergic component."[177  After noting that nicotine and certaindrugs of abuse increase the release of dopamine, the authors of one 1989 studyadded that "[f]ood, too, has this effect, as do some other natural rewards suchas water and salt...."178<p>	In addition to food and water, other dopamine stimulators reported in theliterature include caffeine, magnetic fields, Rapid Eye Movement sleep, acutestress, and sleep deprivation.179  Some researchers have concluded that runningand other exercise cause the release of dopamine.  Even skydiving has beencharacterized as a "mood altering" activity:<p>"Sky divers are unlikely to experience sadness during the `rush' of beingairborne.  Such potent emotional shifts are related to chemical alterations inthe brain, which the individual learns to recreate, through either commodities(drugs or food), or activity."180  <p><p>	FDA also relies on studies finding that nicotine has an effect onelectroencephalographic ("EEG") measurements to establish the pharmacologicaleffect of nicotine.181  Changes in EEG measurements, however, are reported inthe scientific literature in association with a wide range of substances andactivities.  For example, EEG changes are also reported in connection withreading, thinking, listening to music, sleep, sleep deprivation, exercise,odors, aiming a gun, moderate hypothermia, yoga, high altitudes, and visualdisplay terminals.182  EEG changes have also been noted following ingestion ofsucrose, caffeine, and carbon dioxide, and following deprivation ofVitaminE.183  <p>	In short, evidence that an activity or substance may have ]someeffect on the structure or function of the body (including a central nervoussystem effect) does not mean that the substance or activity is "addictive.""fn467"  [184  More importantly, for jurisdictionalpurposes, the existence of some effect-- rather than a significanteffect-- does not mean that a substance falls within the definition ofthe term "drug" in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA").  BasingFDA jurisdiction on these "pharmacological effects" of nicotine goes far beyondthe scope of the FDCA.  ]<h3>3.		The Pharmacological Effects of Nicotine</h3>		<b>Were Well Known Prior to1980</b><p><p>	Contrary to FDA's current claims [185 thepharmacological effects of nicotine, including central nervous system effects,have been extensively investigated and discussed by scientists for decades.  Asexplained below, prior to 1980,186 numerous scientists had conducted andpublished research on the effects of nicotine and other smoke components.  Infact, prior to 1980, hundreds, possibly thousands, of scientific articles hadfocused on some aspect of nicotine pharmacology.<p>	Moreover, in the 1977 ASH petition, which sought FDA regulation ofcigarettes,187 ASH raised the same "scientific" arguments which FDA now claimsto be "new evidence" supporting its jurisdiction over cigarettes.  For example,ASH's 1977 Petition to FDA alleged and argued:<p>	]&#176;	that a cigarette is a drug, and/or that nicotine is a drug;"fn469"  [188<p><p>	]&#176;	that cigarettes do, in fact, affect the structure and function ofthe body;"fn470"  [189<p><p>	]&#176;	that "studies have demonstrated that many smokers smoke largelyfor the physiological effects the drug causes on their body;""fn471"  [190<p><p>	]&#176;	that "[n]umerous medical and other studies treat nicotine as adrug no different in many of its effects than heroin and other addictivesubstances;""fn472"  [191<p><p>	]&#176;	that "90% of all adult smokers would like to quit smoking; that60% have made one or more serious but unsuccessful efforts to do so; that manypeople are unable to stop smoking even though faced with certain death,amputation, etc., and that others are willing to pay hundreds of dollars forsmoking-withdrawal clinics and devices to help them stop;""fn473"  [192<p><p>	]&#176;	that the foregoing "is overwhelmingly persuasive evidence thatcigarettes are `intended to affect the functions of the body' by many users aswell as by the manufacturers;""fn474"  [193<p><p>	]&#176;	that "[n]icotine is an extremely powerful substance exertingpowerful effects-- both immediate and temporary, as well aslong-lasting-- on the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, theheart, lungs and various other bodily structures;""fn475"  [194<p><p>	]&#176;	that "[s]tudies going back at least to 1940, and others justrecently reported, indicate that for many smokers the act of smoking is merelya convenient and socially accepted manner of administering acarefully-controlled dose of nicotine to the body for the purposes of causingthe immediate, temporary, and pleasurable (for some) effects of the drug;""fn476"  [195<p><p>	]&#176;	that "nicotine is not only a powerful drug; it is also atremendously powerful addicting agent for many (perhaps the majority) ofsmokers"; that "[s]mokers not only smoke to achieve the desired effect upontheir bodily functions; their bodies (structure and functions) have so changedin response to the effects of the drug that many cannot do without it, even ifit means their certain death, dismemberment, etc."; that "[m]any smokersseeking to quit suffer the classic withdrawal symptoms usually associated withother addictive drugs;""fn477"  [196<p><p>	]&#176;	that "even when smokers themselves think that they are smoking torelieve stress, they are in fact responding to the effects of the drug nicotineand its withdrawal symptoms in regulating their smoking behavior so as toself-administer the most satisfying dose of nicotine;""fn478"  [197 and<p><p>	]&#176;	that "[a] cigarette is, after all, an instrument, apparatus, orcontrivance designed to administer controlled amounts of nicotine and othersubstances to the smoker upon demand.""fn479"  [198<p><p>	FDA, however, denied ASH's petition ]without rejecting any of these"factual" assertions.199  FDA properly concluded that such allegations,even if true, simply did not provide a basis for FDA jurisdiction in 1977.They provide no basis for such jurisdiction now.<p>	The fact is that for decades there has been a debate over the precise actionsof nicotine in the body and the role nicotine plays in smoking behavior.  It isalso a fact that by the mid-1970's-- before FDA considered andrejected ASH's petition requesting FDA to regulate cigarettes as a drug --it was widely known that nicotine had pharmacological effects."fn480"  [200  <p>	During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, researchers in the scientific communityinvestigated and published extensively on both the nature and sites ofnicotine's pharmacological effects.201  This research explored the role ofnicotine in smoking behavior, as well as the actions of nicotine on the centralnervous system, the cardiovascular system, and other aspects of human andanimal physiology.  <p>	In fact, the ]1964 Surgeon General's Report made many of the sameclaims about smoking that FDA now suggests have only been discovered since1980.  Indeed, there are numerous references in the 1964 Report to the"pharmacological effects" of nicotine."fn500"  [202For example, the ]1964 Report stated that it was well known thatnicotine exerted "detectable pharmacological effects on many organs andstructures including the central nervous system.""fn501"  [203  The ]1964 Report also citedstudies that measure electrical activity in animals and humans resulting fromconcentrations of nicotine, revealing a chemical effect in the brain."fn502"  [204  <p>	Indeed, FDA's description of purported "nicotine withdrawal symptoms" isvirtually identical to language used in the ]1964 Report.  In 1995,FDA states:<p>"The most common self-reported withdrawal symptoms in nicotine-deprived smokersand smokeless tobacco users are increased irritability, anxiety, difficultyconcentrating, restlessness, impatience, and insomnia.""fn503"  [205<p><p>In 1964, the ]Surgeon General's Report stated that smoking cessationcould result in: <p>"increased nervous excitability, such as restlessness, insomnia, anxiety,tremor, palpitation, and in others by diminished excitability, such asdrowsiness, amnesia, impaired concentration and judgment, and diminishedpulse.""fn503"  [206<p><p>	By 1973, there were so many studies on nicotine that it was referred to as a"well-studied pharmacological agent."207  In 1979, entire sections of the]Surgeon General's Report were dedicated to the central nervoussystem and physiological effects of nicotine and smoking"fn509"  [208 -- as were chapters of major referencebooks on tobacco.209<p>	For example, the ]1979 Report stated:<p>"[T]he pharmacological effects of smoking are not related solely to nicotine;rather it is the combined effect of the whole smoke.  Nevertheless, nicotine isgenerally accepted as the principal constituent responsible forcigarette smokers' pharmacological response . . .""fn522"  [210<p><p>The ]1979 Report continued:<p>"Whether or not it is the only reinforcing agent, nicotine is the mostpowerful pharmacological agent in cigarette smoke.""fn523"  [211<p><p>The ]1979 Report also noted that "nicotine has been proposed as theprimary incentive in smoking and may be instrumental in the establishment ofthe smoking habit.""fn524"  [212<p>	Although researchers acknowledged that the reasons people smoke are complexand multifaceted, the notion that FDA only recently "discovered" that nicotineplays a role in the pharmacological effects of smoking or that nicotine mayplay a role in smoking behavior is absurd.  Indeed, FDA cannot now plausiblycontend that in 1980, when it considered ASH's factual contentions and rejectedASH's petition, the Agency was unaware of the 1979 ]Surgeon General'sReport.<p>	Clearly, what FDA currently cites as "new evidence" on this point is reallyold news.  The fact that researchers report that nicotine has measurablepharmacological effects, including central nervous system effects, has been well-knownfor decades.  Such effects did not provide a basis for FDA jurisdiction overcigarettes in 1979, when FDA rejected ASH's "nicotine" petition; they do notprovide a basis for such jurisdiction now.  <h2>I.	CONSUMERS DO NOT SMOKE CIGARETTES "NEARLY EXCLUSIVELY"</h2>	<b>FOR THE PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OFNICOTINE</><p><p>	FDA claims that people smoke "nearly exclusively" or primarily for thepharmacological effects of nicotine.  As we discuss in Volume II of thesecomments, FDA jurisdiction cannot be based on consumer use of a product.  Evenapart from that controlling legal point, however, the fact is FDA is wrong.Consumers do not smoke "nearly exclusively," or even primarily, for the centralnervous system effects of nicotine.  As set forth below, consumers smoke formany reasons other than nicotine.<h3>1.		FDA's Claim That 75 Percent to 90 Percent of</h3><b>		Smokers Smoke "To Satisfy Addiction" Is</b><p>		<b>Legally Insufficient and Factually Unsupported</b><p><p>	The core of FDA's argument on "consumer intent" is its claim that most smokersare nicotine dependent and thus smoke "to satisfy addiction.""fn525"  [213  In an attempt to prove this assertion,FDA selectively extracts pieces of data from various studies to argue that75percent to 90percent of smokers are nicotine dependent.214  Thedata FDA relies upon, however, do not measure the prevalence of so-called"nicotine addiction" among the general population of smokers.215  Moreover,even when adopting the overly broad criteria of "addiction" used by FDA, thereis no consensus that even 75percent of smokers smoke "to satisfyaddiction." <p>	]First, as the researchers cited by FDA note, the prevalence of"addiction" or "dependence" depends wholly on the criteria used to define thoseterms:<p>"The different definitions of tobacco dependence and withdrawal producedvery different prevalence rates and showed little confidence.  One possiblereason for this lack of agreement is that one or more of the definitions areinvalid.""fn531"  [216  <p><p>	As another group of researchers noted in 1994, there is "no definitive way ofestimating dependence on smoking or on nicotine."217  Given the current debateover the criteria for "dependence," therefore, it is impossible to determineaccurately the number of smokers who are "dependent":  <p>"The extent to which smokers in the general population are dependent oraddicted is unknown.  ]No satisfactory questionnaire or other method iscurrently available for measuring the severity of dependence in large samplesof smokers.""fn537"  [218  <p><p>	]Second, the results of the studies relied upon by FDA cannot beprojected to the general smoking population.  The sample populations(i.e., the groups of smokers studied by the researchers)consisted largely of patients at substance abuse clinics and smokers who smokeda higher than average number of cigarettes per day.  The results of studieswhich use such populations have been criticized by researchers in the field.For example, in 1991, Dr.Hughes noted that studies which<p>"used the 5% to 10% of smokers seen in smoking cessation programs assubjects... are problematic because smokers who attendsuch programs appear to be more dependent on nicotine than self-quitters;i.e. they smoke more cigarettes per day, have more prior unsuccessfulattempts to quit, and score higher on scales of dependence.""fn539"  [219<p><p>	As Drs. Giovino and Henningfield recently acknowledged, a study of subjectswho are being treated for substance abuse will result in "estimates [ofdependence that] are ]probably higher than would be found in the generalpopulation.""fn542"  [220  <p>	Given the fact that most of the researchers cited by FDA used the DSM-III-R'samorphous and subjective criteria of "dependence," it is no surprise that someof these studies found that a majority of subjects were so-called "nicotinedependent."  The data from such studies, however, cannot be used to supportFDA's claim that 75percent to 90percent of all smokers smoke to"satisfy addiction."221 <p>	]Third, most of the studies cited by FDA rely solely uponinterviews of smokers to determine whether they meet the amorphous criteria of"dependence" used by the researchers.  This system of "self-reporting" has beenrecognized to result in inaccurate conclusions."fn545"  [222  <p>	]Finally, many of the studies cited by FDA conclude that theprevalence of "nicotine dependence" among all smokers is far less than75percent, even using the broad criteria of "addiction" relied on byFDA."fn547"  [223  FDA is aware of these conclusions,but either omits them or, worse, mischaracterizes the researchers'"unfavorable" results.  FDA's deliberate manipulation and distortion of theresults of these studies is further evidence of the arbitrary and capriciousnature of FDA's attempt to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes.]<h4>a.		"Population Studies" Relied upon</h4>			<b>byFDA&nbsp</b><p><p>	FDA relies principally upon five "population studies" for itscontention that 75percent to 90percent of smokers are "nicotine-dependent." Using only these five studies, FDA asserts that 75percent to90percent of smokers smoke "to satisfy addiction."  As discussed below,however, none of these studies provides valid scientific support for FDA'scontention.  <h5>(i)	  Hughes et al. (1987)"fn548"  [224  ]</h5>	FDA's characterization of the results of this study is misleading.  In itsJurisdictional Analysis, FDA states that "the investigators concluded that90percent (n=905) of the smokers fulfilled the DSM-III criteria fortobacco dependence.""fn549"  [225  That assertion isaccurate, but incredibly misleading.<p>	FDA ]omits the crucial portion of the report of the study, in whichthe researchers explicitly state that the 90percent figure is fartoo expansive.  Specifically, the researchers note that they are not aware ofany study supporting the validity of the DSM-III-R criteria, and they concludethat "the fact that this definition [DSM-III-R criteria] classified 90% ofthe tobacco users in this study as dependent suggests that it is overinclusiveand thus may lack diagnostic discriminability.""fn549"  [226  <p>	Significantly, FDA also omits the authors' ]own conclusionsregarding the prevalence of "addiction."  Using criteria they believed to bemore accurate than DSM-III, the authors conclude that "one-thirdof smokers are either behaviorally dependent or physically dependent ontobacco...."227  <p>	The results of this survey are also unreliable because the researchers used apopulation that is not representative of the average smoking population:  1006men who smoked approximately 28 cigarettes per day and had smoked for33years.  Clearly, the prevalence of "dependence" -- using the DSM-IIIcriteria -- will be higher in this population than in the general smokingpopulation.<p>	In fact, a number of studies have found that most smokers smoke fewer than 28cigarettes per day.  For example, Giovino et al. determined that<p>"[a]mong current cigarette smokers, the percentage who smoked more than 15cigarettes per day was aproximately ... 37% in 1991.  Thepercentage of smokers who were heavier smokers (i.e., who smokedmore than 25 cigarettes per day) was about ... 22% in 1991.""fn552"  [228  <p><p>Using these statistics, the Hughes study cited by FDA would apply to, at most,22percent of smokers.229 ]<h5>(ii)		 Woody et al. (1993)"fn560"  [230  ]</h5>	In this study, the researchers determined that 87percent of the smokersstudied were dependent, according to the broad (and unscientific) DSM-III-Rcriteria.  As discussed above, these criteria are not reliable measures of"dependence" or "addiction."<p>	Further, 65percent of the subjects in this study were patients insubstance abuse clinics.231  That a large percentage of smokers beingtreated for substance abuse fall within the DSM-III-R's definition of "nicotinedependent" is hardly surprising-- but a "finding" with respect to thatskewed population cannot be used to estimate "nicotine dependence" among thegeneral smoking population.  <p>	Indeed, in describing the Woody study, Drs.Giovino and Henningfieldconceded that: <p>"Because about 65percent of the persons were in treatment (forunspecified conditions), these estimates are probably higher than would befound in the general population.""fn561"  [232<p><p>	It is noteworthy that the Woody study also concluded that tobacco does nothave a high abuse liability and "does not progress to severe levels ofdependence as readily as cocaine, heroin and most other drugs."233  Thus, evenusing the broad DSM-III-R criteria of dependence, the researchers were not ableto conclude that nicotine dependence "was severe" or similar to that ofcocaine, heroin, and other addictive drugs.  ]<h5>(iii)	  Cottler (1993)"fn566"  [234  ]</h5>	In this study, the data used by the researchers were collected during theSubstance Abuse Disorders Field Trials for DSM-IV.  Again, the subjects of thesurvey were not representative of the general population:  As these sameresearchers noted in a 1995 article, only 38percent of the subjects ofthe DSM-IVfield trial studies were from the general population."fn567"  [235  Sixty-threepercent of the sample surveyed was made up of the following:  <p>	]&#176;	patients in an in-patient treatment program<p><p>	&#176;	patients in residential polysubstance abuse programs<p><p>	&#176;	subjects in a tobacco-relatedphysical disabilities program."fn570"  [236<p><p>	In an article reviewing the Cottler DSM-IVfield trial study, the author noted that:<p>"[A] large majority of the field trial sample were selected from treated orclinical settings.  ]In these settings, it would be expected that moresevere cases of dependence would be found, with individuals reporting most, ifnot all, symptoms of the substance use disorders.""fn571"  [237<p><p>The same author stated that a study population "pre-selectedon the basis of substance use [would] constitute[] a group at higher risk forabuse and dependence than would be found in a true general populationsample."238 <p>	Further, Cottler ]et al. recognized potential problems withthe criteria they used to determine whether the subjects were dependent:  "Theconcern that one system or another too easily diagnoses dependence needs to beaddressed in future studies.""fn574"  [239  Theresults of this study thus cannot be used as a reliable measure of "nicotinedependence" among the general population of smokers.  ]<h5>(iv)	  Hale et al. (1993)"fn575"  [240  ]</h5><b>	</b>	In this one-paragraphmonograph, the authors reported the results of a telephone survey conducted atone of the DSM-IV field trial sites.  The survey population consisted of only201 residents of Burlington, Vermont, who were questioned about their smokinghabits.  Only 46 of the subjects were current smokers.  Clearly, theresults of this "study" have limited applications to the general population ofsmokers.  As Drs. Giovino and Henningfield conceded, with some understatement,"This report is limited because of the small sample size.""fn578"  [241  ]<p><b>	</b>	FDA misleadingly omits the crucial conclusions from the report of thissurvey.  The researchers stated, "Our results should be considered estimatesbecause how to apply DSM-III-R criteria to nicotine use is still unclear andbecause our sample size is small.""fn581"  [242Using the Fagerstrom criteria, the researchers found that ]only18percent of males and 21percent of females were "dependent.""fn584"  [243  Neither statistic comes close to FDA's75percent.  ]<h5>(v)		Breslau et al."fn585"  [244]</h5><p>	FDA's final "population study" was conducted by Breslau etal.  The researchers surveyed a group of 1200 young adults (ages 21-30).394 of the subjects reported smoking daily for a month or more in theirlifetime.  The survey did not purport to examine the prevalence of nicotine"dependence" among the general population of smokers.<p>	Here, FDA notes the correct conclusion of the researchers.  However, only51percent of the 394 "lifetime smokers" were deemed to be "dependent.""fn590"  [245  Further, 62percent of those"dependent" smokers were only "mildly dependent," 38percent were"moderately dependent," and none was "severely dependent."246  Finally,"dependency" was determined by the DSM-III-R criteria, which, as noted above,are not reliable measures of "dependence."  Thus, these reports provide noevidence that smokers smoke "nearly exclusively" to maintain nicotinedependence.]<h4>b.		Rates of Dependence Based on Individual</h4>			<b>DSM-III-R Criteria or "Symptoms of Addiction"</b><p><p>	In addition to the "population studies" discussed above, FDA reliesupon a number of studies discussed in Appendix1 to the "JurisdictionalAnalysis" that purport to establish that smokers meet individual DSM-III-Rcriteria of dependence:<p>"In addition to published population studies on overall criteria to determinethe number of dependent smokers, it may be appropriate to assess the number ofdependent smokers by examining to what degree `typical' smokers meet individualDSM-III-R criteria.""fn595"  [247  <p><p>Contrary to the Agency's claim, the use of these data is an inappropriate andscientifically unsupportable method to determine either the prevalence ofpurported "nicotine dependence" among the general smoking population or whetherany smoker is "addicted" to nicotine.248<p>	]First, as discussed at length above, the DSM-III-R criteria areoverbroad and inaccurate markers of substance dependence.  Even FDAacknowledges that "[t]he weight each criterion should be given is the subjectof ongoing discussion and investigation.""fn595"  [249  <p>	]Second, finding that a specific group of smokers "satisfies" anindividual DSM-III-R criterion or exhibits a "symptom" of addiction does notindicate that all of these smokers are "dependent," even under DSM-III-Rstandards.  Indeed, the fact that a study finds that a certain percentage of aspecific group of smokers meets a single DSM-III-R criterion has nosignificance to the determination of "nicotine dependence" among the generalpopulation of smokers.  DSM-III-R requires that at least three criteriabe met by the same person before that individual is classified as"dependent.""fn595"  [250  But the studies cited byFDA, however, do not establish that the same group of smokers--]or even a single smoker -- satisfied three or more of the DSM-III-Rcriteria."fn595"  [251  <p>	In fact, smokers who satisfy a single (or even two) DSM-III-R criterion maynot be "dependent," according to DSM-III-R.  For example, a recent study byBreslau found that <p>"the two most common [DSM-III-R] symptoms.... smokingmore than intended and unsuccessful attempts to quit ]were reportedby... considerable proportions of non-dependent smokers:47.9% and 25.5 respectively.""fn599"  [252  <p><p>	Thus, as Breslau showed, FDA's figures regarding the prevalence of dependenceamong smokers assessed by reference to a single DSM-III-R "criterion" may wellinclude many smokers who are "nondependent" under DSM-III-R'sstandards.  <p>	]Third, the results of many of these studies actually undercutFDA's argument that 75percent to 90percent of smokers are "nicotinedependent."  Indeed, according to many of these studies, the prevalence of"nicotine dependence" is far lower than 75percent of the population ofsmokers.  Clearly, if a study concludes that only a small proportion of thesubjects are "dependent," it is irrelevant that the study found that a singleDSM-III-R criterion was experienced by a majority of smokers in that study.<p>	Fourth, the same problems noted with the "population studies"(e.g., non-representativesubject populations, reliance on self-reporting,ambiguous criteria of "addiction") apply to the studies cited by FDA inAppendix1 to its "Jurisdictional Analysis." <p>	The following discussion of each criterion and the studies cited by FDAestablishes that FDA's analysis is misleading and inaccurate.<h5>(i)		Criterion One:  "Substance Often Taken In</h5><b>				Larger Amounts or Over a Longer Period of</b><p>				<b>Time Than The Person Intended"</b><p><p>	FDA asserts that "most smokers meet this criterion fordependence.""fn600"  [253  The only basis for thisconclusion, however, is an inference:  FDA argues that because "3 out of 4smokers say they would like to stop, it is reasonable to ]infer thatover a period of weeks most smokers would say they smoked more than theyintended to smoke.""fn600"  [254  Mere inferences ofthis sort cannot support FDA's decision to regulate cigarettes.  There must bevalid scientific studies, carefully designed data collection and statisticalanalysis, and properly developed conclusions.  None of the studies cited inthis section provides the necessary foundation for FDA's claim.<p>	FDA cites one article by Dr.Jaffe in which he considers whether a"typical" smoker meets this criterion.  Yet, like FDA, Dr.Jaffe can donothing more than speculate that "most smokers would say that they smoked morethan they intended to."255  Dr.Jaffe acknowledges that "[t]he typicalsmoker is generally aware of his/her daily level of intake."256  And heconcedes that "[i]n this sense smokers do not commonly use more than theyintended to use."257  Dr.Jaffe further recognizes, "[t]ypically, tobaccosmokers do not go on binges and wake up a day or two later regretting all theextra cigarettes."258  Finally, despite his speculation that most smokers wouldsay they smoked more than they intended to, Dr.Jaffe admits that"]it is not clear how many smokers meet this specific criterion as setforth in DSM-III-R.""fn605"  [259<p>	Without any evidence that most smokers fulfill this DSM-III-R criterion, FDAtries to draw more "inferences" from studies that consider the number ofcigarettes smoked and the "regularity" with which smokers smoke.  None of thesestudies shows that smokers meet this DSM-III-Rcriterion or that nearly all smokers are "addicted" to nicotine.<p>	FDA's fundamental error is its assumption that a "regular" smoker is"dependent" on nicotine and smokes more cigarettes than he or she intended.  Tothe contrary, as one researcher stated, "it is clear that ]many peoplebecome regular smokers without apparently developing a strong dependence uponnicotine and are able to quit the habit without much difficulty.""fn606"  [260  As Professor Collins has stated, theassumption that<p>"an habitual smoker is automatically addicted totobacco...]may be as fallacious as is theassumption that everyone who drinks alcohol on a daily basis is addicted toalcohol.  It may be that some tobacco smokers can use nicotine chronicallywithout becoming fully dependent on it.""fn607"  [261<p><p>	Thus, although FDA provides polling data indicating that 87.5percent ofcurrent smokers smoke every day,262 this "fact," whether accurate or not, doesnot mean that smokers smoke more than they want to.  Nor does it mean that87.5percent of smokers are "addicted" to nicotine.  Indeed, Dr. Hughes --a leading advocate of the "addiction" theory of smoking behavior --has stated that 89percent of people who drink caffeinated beverages do soon a daily basis.263  Yet FDA has not claimed that all of these people are"addicted" to caffeine.<p>	FDA also relies upon studies that claim to show that many people who "try"cigarettes become "regular" smokers.  Here, again, FDA equates "regular"smoking with "nicotine dependence."  For example, arguing that 70percentto 82percent of people who "try" cigarettes become "regular" smokers, FDAclaims that a British study "demonstrated how easily people becomedependent."264  The data from that study, however, refer only to the number ofpeople who were "regular" smokers.  The study did ]not assume that"regular" smokers were "addicted" to nicotine.  In fact, the study's definitionof "regular" smokers included people who smoked as few as five cigarettes perday.  Similarly, in the Irish study discussed by FDA,"fn613"  [265 a "regular" smoker was someone who smokedas few as one cigarette per day for six months.  As FDA knows, evenanti-smoking researchers believe that people who smoke five cigarettes per dayare ]not "nicotine dependent.""fn615"  [266<p>	Moreover, researchers have disputed the notion "that smoking only a fewcigarettes leads to a near inevitable escalation to regular smoking":<p>"recent work has suggested that perhaps only onethird to one half ofthose young people who experiment with cigarettes go on to become regularsmokers."267<p><p>	Further, the relevance of the British study highlighted by FDA to currentsmokers in the United States is questionable.  As FDA acknowledges, the Britishstudy was conducted ]almost 30 years ago.  Discussing this samestudy in 1995, even Dr.Henningfield stated that "these data might not berelevant regarding current risks.""fn622"  [268Basing a finding of "consumer use" in the United States today on findings froma British study conducted in 1967 is simply not proper.<p>	Indeed, FDA states that ]recent data suggest that "between 33% and50% of people who try cigarettes become regular smokers" --a far cry fromthe 70 percent to 80 percent based on the British and Irish studies."fn626"  [269  Nevertheless, even this recent figuredoes ]not support FDA's claim that most smokers smoke "more thanthey intended" or are "addicted."<p>	FDA also relies upon a 1993 article by Breslau etal. for this sameproposition."fn634"  [270  That article, however,does not even address the (irrelevant) point raised by FDA:  the amount or"regularity" of smoking.  Moreover, Breslau, ]et al.concluded that only 27percent of "ever" smokers were nicotine"dependent."  Thus, using FDA's reasoning and accepting the standards for"dependence" used by these researchers, only 27percent of people who"ever" smoked became nicotine "dependent.""fn635"  [271  <p>	FDA cites an article by Anthony ]et al. that analyzes theresults of the National Comorbidity Survey."fn638"  [272  FDA claims that the researchers foundthat 31.9percent of people who smoked tobacco at least one time"developed tobacco dependence."273  The study, however, was not designed todetermine whether experimentation with cigarettes led to "regular" smoking.Moreover, as discussed above, this 31percent figure directly contradictsFDA's earlier claims that 75percent to 90percent of smokers are"addicted."<p>		]<h5>(iii)	Criterion Two:  "Persistent Desire or One</h5><b>				or More Unsuccessful Efforts to Cut Down</b><p>				<b>or Control Substance Use"&nsp;</b><p><p>	FDA assumes that most smokers satisfy this criterion because,according to the Agency, "[s]urveys have found that most smokers report theywould like to stop smoking," and "[m]any [smokers], despite multiple attemptsat quitting, have been unable to stop smoking.""fn639"  [274  The sole basis for this "conclusion" isinterview surveys in which smokers are asked whether they want to stopsmoking.<p>	Whether a smoker states in a survey that he or she does not want to smoke orwould like to stop smoking, however, is not an accurate measure of the smoker'strue desire to quit smoking.  Given the social pressures on smokers today, itis hardly surprising that most smokers will say that they "do ]notwant to smoke."  As one recent article stated, <p>"[M]any surveys of smokers have revealed that large portions of smokers wishthat they did not smoke and had never taken it up.  Plainly, social contextsin which smoking is increasingly vilified can produce a gap between what peoplefeel obliged to say to researchers and what they genuinely feel.""fn639"  [275  <p><p>Dr. Kozlowski has made a similar observation:<p>"How better for a smoker to avoid the pestering of a physician or otherinterviewer than to say (whether believing it or not) that he wants to and haseven tried to give up cigarettes.  And, if the questioner asks if the attemptsto stop have been serious, who would want to confess to a half-heartedeffort."276 <p><p>	Further, as noted in a 1994 report by the Congressional Research Service("CRS"):<p>"The fact that many individuals would like to quit is indicative of thedifficulty of breaking pleasurable habits ]but does not necessarilyprove a serious addiction problem.  As an illustration of how one mightinterpret discrepancies between statements of preference and action, Viscusinotes that half of the people who live in Los Angeles say they would like toleave.  The fact that they do not leave does not mean that they have no controlover the decision, but rather that they perceive the benefits of staying to begreater than the benefits of leaving.  Similarly, individuals may say theywould like to quit, but when dealing with the actual decision continue to smokebecause they enjoy it and cessation is a deprivation of an accustomedpleasure.""fn641"  [277<p><p>	Thus, FDA's reliance on polls in which smokers state that they are either"addicted" or that they would like to stop smoking is invalid.  For example,FDA states that "[i]n one study, 70% of current smokers reported that theywould like to stop smoking."278  But, as discussed above, that statistic alonemeans nothing regarding the ability of smokers to quit or their true desire toquit.  Further, the study found that ]only 34percent of currentsmokers actually attempt to quit.279  Obviously, if a person does not evenmake an attempt to quit, a statement that he or she wants to do so is hardly anexpression of a true desire to do so.  FDA's reliance on the results of a 1987Gallup Poll is similarly flawed."fn642"  [280  <p>	FDA also asserts that 83percent to 87percent of smokers who smokemore than 26 cigarettes per day claim they are "addicted."281  FDA cites a so-called"1991/1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse" as support for this claim,but has provided to the docket only a single graph that apparently reflectsdata from this survey.  In fact, there were two separate National HouseholdSurveys, one conducted in 1991 and one in 1992.282  In those surveys, therespondents were asked to identify "each drug you felt you needed or weredependent on."283  Again, responses of smokers to such a question are not validmarkers of any purported "nicotine dependence."  In addition, data regardingthe beliefs of smokers who smoke more than 26 cigarettes per day are notapplicable to the general smoking population:  Most smokers do not smoke morethan a pack of cigarettes per day.284<p>	In further support of its claim that most smokers fulfill this DSM-III-Rcriterion, FDA asserts that "[e]ach year in the United States, 15 millionpeople try to quit smoking, but less than 3percent have long-termsuccess."285  FDA does not cite the original source of that information.  Areview of the articles FDA cites, however, reveals that the claim is based on asingle study published in 1993.286  That study, however, did ]notstate that fifteen million smokers had "tried to quit," but rather, that theyhad reported that for "at least one day" during the preceding year they had notsmoked for whatever reason.287<p>	FDA is thus assuming that all smokers who did not smoke for even a single dayduring the entire year-- because they found themselves in a location thatdid not permit smoking, they had a sore throat or cold, or they simply did notwant to smoke-- were trying to quit permanently and failedto do so.  That is simply not a valid assumption."fn646"  [288<p>	FDA's position also assumes that most people cannot quit smoking.  That is nottrue.  Many people do quit smoking, including those who would be considered"addicted" under the broadest diagnostic criteria for "nicotine addiction."289According to the ]1990 Surgeon General's Report, "[m]ore than 38million Americans have quit smoking cigarettes, and nearly half of all livingadults who ever smoked have quit.""fn649"  [290  The]1990 Report also states that "90 percent of former smokers quitwithout using smoking cessation programs, counseling, or nicotine gum.""fn650"  [291  Thus, as a recent article stated,<p>"The dominant public discourse on quitting smoking characterizes the process astraumatic, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.  Much of this discourse isled by clinicians who work with smokers who come to see them for assistance inquitting.  However, help-seekingsmokers are very atypical of smokers in general:  community-basedstudies of ex-smokers repeatedly show that more than 90% of ex-smokers stopsmoking without recourse to any professional help or guidance whatsoever."292<p><p>	In its "Jurisdictional Analysis," FDA makes the categorical statement that"[a] smoker who makes a serious attempt to stop smoking has a less than5percent chance of being off cigarettes a year later."293  To supportthis claim, FDA cites a 1991 article.  That article, however, merely states,"Approximately 95% of all patients ]who are going to relapse will doso in the first 12 months.""fn656"  [294  This doesnot mean that 95percent of all people ]who try to quit willresume smoking in the first year.  In fact, according to the authors of thearticle, 30percent to 40percent of the people who "try to quit" aresuccessful."fn657"  [295  Once again, FDAmischaracterizes the data from the very studies it cites.<p>	FDA relies upon the 1985 NIDA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse ("NHS")to state that 54percent of smokers "try to cut down."296  But FDA doesnot provide the data from that study.  Instead, FDA cites a 1990 article byHenningfield ]et al. in which the authors discuss certainaspects of the NHS data."fn659"  [297  In thatreport, the authors note that the NHS found that 54.2percent of smokers"tried to cut down."298  This number, however, does not provide any meaningfulinformation. <p>	]First, the authors do not reveal whether these smokers weresuccessful in "cutting down."  Smokers were merely asked to respond to thequestion, "Have you ever tried to cut down on your use of any of thesedrugs?""fn661"  [299  Many smokers who respondedaffirmatively may have ]succeeded in reducing the number ofcigarettes they smoked."fn662"  [300  ]<p>	Second, even if it were true that these smokers failed to cutdown, it is not clear that those "failures" were related to nicotine intake.Individual decisions to maintain a particular level of smoking may in fact bethe product of (1)a desire for other attributes of smoking such as taste,(2)a simple decision to resume a pleasurable habit, which cannot becharacterized as a "failure," or (3)any of the other non-nicotine-relatedreasons people smoke.  <p>	Third, the fact that 54percent of the smokers interviewed "triedto cut down" is not a measure of their "dependence" on nicotine.  In fact, only37.9percent of the smokers surveyed in the 1985 National Household Surveystated that they believed they "needed" or were "dependent" on cigarettes."fn663"  [301  This survey, therefore, does not supportFDA's conclusion that most smokers have a "persistent desire or one or moreunsuccessful efforts to quit," or that most smokers are "addicted" tonicotine.302  <p>	FDA's reliance upon the 1992 study by Breslau ]etal.is also misplaced.  FDA claims that this study found that 61percent ofsmokers tried unsuccessfully to "cut down."  The 61percent figure isbased on a limited sub-groupof 241 respondents who had "ever" smoked daily for a month or more and hadtried "at least once to quit or cut down unsuccessfully.""fn666"  [303  As the authors noted, however, some ofthese smokers had quit as of the time of the interview and, thus, weresuccessful quitters.304<p>	FDA tries to use the Hale and Hughes "population studies" as further evidencethat most smokers have a "persistent desire to quit" or have made "unsuccessfulattempts to quit."305  However, as discussed above, these studies are notaccurate measures of dependence -- or any single criterion of dependence amongthe general smoking population.  For example, in the Hale study, ]only46 smokers were interviewed.  Further, as discussed above, the researchersfound that under certain criteria of "dependence" only 18percent of themales and 21percent of the females in this survey were "nicotinedependent.""fn670"  [306<p>	The results of the Hughes study are similarly not applicable to the generalsmoking population.  FDA claims that the researchers found that 42percentof the subjects studied "had tried to quit at least three times."307  In thatstudy, however, the researchers determined that only one third of the smokerswere "nicotine dependent" under criteria which the researchers considered moreaccurate than the DSM-III-Rcriteria.308  Moreover, although the researchers found that 42percent ofthe smokers had tried to quit at least three times, they also found that87percent of these smokers were able to stop smoking for at least 24hours and that many of them were able to quit for a period of 69 to 139days.309  <p>	FDA also claims that data from the 1991 and 1992 National Household Survey onDrug Abuse indicate that 75percent of the people who "tried to cut down"on their use of cigarettes reported that they could not "cut down."310According to the data published by the Department of Health and HumanServices,311 however, the 1992 study found that of smokers who smoked at leastonce in the past year and of smokers who smoked a pack or more per day,40.2percent and 49.6percent, respectively, reported that they hadtried to quit and had failed.312  In the 1991 study, the numbers were43.9percent and 54.3percent, respectively.313<p>	FDA alleges that these surveys also found that 80percent of 25+ year-oldsmokers who smoked between 16 and 25 cigarettes per day could not "cut down" onthe amount they smoked.314  Again, the Agency is wrong.  According to the HHSpublications, in 1992, 54.3percent of 26 to 34-year-olds and46.3percent of 35+ year-old smokers who smoked more than a pack per dayreported that they had tried and could not cut down.315  In 1991, the numberswere 58.9percent and 51.1percent, respectively.316<p>	Further, even these numbers probably are inflated by the same social pressuresconceded by even anti-smoking researchers, as discussed above.  But the simplepoint is that the Agency's repeated effort to inflate numbers in a futileeffort to suggest some "nearly exclusive" use of cigarettes to feed "nicotineaddiction" cannot explain why even a majority of smokers, in fact, do or do notsmoke.  <p>	FDA likewise cites a number of surveys in which adolescent smokers state thatit is "difficult" or "hard" to quit smoking.  FDA uses the Teenage Attitudesand Preference Survey (TAPS) for its finding that 80percent of teenagesmokers who smoke more than 16 cigarettes per day smoke because "it's reallyhard to quit," and that 74percent of daily teenage smokers smoke because"it's hard to quit."317  That survey, however, did not ask the smokers whetherthey wanted to quit at all, or whether they had tried to quit and had failed.In any event, the most common explanation given by all smokers in this surveyfor the reason why they smoked was that they "just like" to smoke.318<p>	FDA simply has not made its case that even a majority of smokers-- muchless "nearly all" of smokers -- have a "persistent desire" to quit smoking orhave had "one or more unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control" theirsmoking.<p>		]<h5>(v)	Criterion Three: "A Great Deal of Time</h5><b>				Spent in Activities Necessary to Get the</b><p><b>				Substance, Take the Substance, or Recover</b><p>				<b>From Its Effects"&nsp;</b><p><p>	Smokers clearly do not satisfy this criterion of "addiction" or"dependence."  Even FDA admits that this criterion, which is quite readilysatisfied by drug addictions, is "not commonly used in diagnosing tobaccodependence.""fn685"  [319<p>		]<h5>(vii)	Criterion Four:  "Frequent Intoxication or</h5><b>				Withdrawal Symptoms When Expected to Fulfill</b><p>				<b>Major Role Obligations at Work, School or Home"</b><p><p>	As discussed above, smokers do not become intoxicated.  Indeed,FDA acknowledges that this criterion is not satisfied by smokers:  "Roleimpairment attributable to tobacco is minimal.""fn685"  [320  As Dr.Jaffe stated in discussingthis criterion, "If there are such smokers they are exceedingly rare."321]<h5>(viii)		Criterion Five:  "Important Social, Occupational</h5><b>				or Recreational Activities Given Up or Reduced</b><p>				<b>Because of Substance Use"&nsp;</b><p><p>	Once again, FDA is forced by the facts to admit that anotherDSM-III-R criterion, so common in drug addictions, is not satisfied bysmokers."fn687"  [322<p>		]<h5>(x)	Criterion Six: "Continued Substance Use</h5><b>				Despite Knowledge of Having a Persistent</b><p><b>				or Recurrent Social, Psychological or</b><p><b>				Physical Problem That Is Caused or Exacerbated</b><p>				<b>By the Use of the Substance"&nsp;</b><p><p>	FDA relies primarily upon the results of a 1993 Gallup Poll tosupport its contention that most smokers satisfy this DSM-III-R criterion.  FDAsuggests that the poll results show that smokers believe that smoking isharmful to their health and that they would avoid serious health problems byquitting.  FDA apparently believes that many smokers satisfy this DSM-III-Rcriterion because 65percent of smokers surveyed "believe that smoking hasalready affected their health.""fn687"  [323<p>	What FDA fails to reveal is that the poll also asked smokers to rate theirhealth:  "In general, how do you rate your health?  Is it excellent, good,fair, or poor?"324  The vast majority of smokers responded that their healthwas either good or excellent.  Indeed, only 4percent of smokers respondedthat they were in "poor" health.  Clearly, this poll does not support FDA'sposition that most smokers smoke despite knowledge of persistent or recurringphysical problems.<p>	Moreover, the fact that smokers smoke despite their knowledge of the risksassociated with smoking does not mean that smokers are "addicted."  People canchoose to engage in risky behavior without being "addicted" to that behavior.<p>	FDA also cites three articles that claim that some smokers continue to smokeafter suffering a heart attack, lung cancer, or laryngeal cancer.325  Thesestudies, however, do not prove (1)that most people diagnosed with theseinjuries continue to smoke or (2)that the smokers who resumed smoking inthe specific studies cited by FDA were "addicted."  More importantly, theresults of these small studies simply cannot be attributed to all smokers. <p>	FDA makes the unqualified statement that "almost half of the smokers whoundergo surgery for lung cancer resume smoking."326  Indeed, inAppendix1, FDA claims that "]more than half resume smoking.""fn690"  [327  Yet FDA cites ]only a single studyof 50 smokers from 1982 in support of this broad claim."fn690"  [328  That single study hardly proves FDA'sclaim that half of all people who smoke and who develop lung cancer resumesmoking after diagnosis or surgery.  Such anecdotal evidence from such a smallstudy in 1982 cannot serve as the basis for asserting jurisdiction overcigarettes.<p>	Similarly, FDA states that "forty percent of persons who are smokers at thetime of laryngectomy resumed smoking after surgery."329  Again, FDA cites onlya single study from 1985 in which 52 laryngeal cancer patients "tried" smokingagain after a laryngectomy.330  Moreover, the researchers did not conclude thatthese patients continued to smoke regularly.  In fact, as the researchersstate, "The 40% of patients smoking after their laryngectomy had fallen to 19%(25 subjects) by the time of the survey."331  <p>	FDA makes a similarly broad statement regarding the smoking habits of smokerswho had suffered a heart attack.332  However, the article cited by the Agencyconcerning smoking after heart attacks (which was a literature review), in factfound that "a ]significant number of individuals quit smokingfollowing a MI [myocardial infarction] without receiving formal anti-smokingtreatment.""fn693"  [333<p>		]<h5>(xii)	Criterion Seven:  "Marked Tolerance: Need for</h5><b>				Markedly Increased Amounts of the Substance</b><p><b>				(i.e., at Least a 50% Increase in Intake to</b><p><b>				Achieve Intoxication or Desired Effect or</b><p><b>				Markedly Diminishing Effect With Continue[d]</b><p>				<b>Use of the SameAmount)"nbsp;</b><p><p>	As discussed above, smokers do not develop "tolerance" as thatterm is used to define drug "addiction."  The studies cited by FDA do not proveotherwise."fn701"  [334  Indeed, according to FDA,only 12percent to 20percent of smokers in these surveys reported aneed to smoke more cigarettes to "get the same effect."335  Even if suchstatements were evidence of true tolerance (which they are not), the reportedeffect is hardly widespread or "marked."]<h5>(xiii)			Criterion Eight:  "Characteristic</h5>				<b>Withdrawal Symptoms"</b>p><p>	There is no well-definedor meaningful "nicotine withdrawal syndrome."  As discussed above, the"symptoms" of the purported "nicotine withdrawal syndrome" are, in fact,largely subjective and amorphous.  Further, there is little evidence that thepurported severity or presence of these "symptoms" is an important factor inultimate smoking maintenance or cessation.  Thus, whether studies have foundthat smokers experience these "symptoms" means nothing regarding the prevalenceof any so-called "nicotine addiction."<p>	FDA first relies upon studies that show that smokers experience a "craving"for cigarettes after quitting."fn701"  [336  Asdiscussed above, however, "craving" has long been criticized as an indicator orcriterion of nicotine "addiction" or "withdrawal."  Further, researchers haverecently suggested that "craving" may be attributable primarily to factorsother than any pharmacological effects of nicotine.337  Whether smokers in aparticular study reported "craving," therefore, does not mean that most smokersare "addicted" to nicotine.<p>	Moreover, the Hughes study discussed by FDA does not support the conclusionthat most smokers exhibit "characteristic withdrawal symptoms."338  Thoseresults were based upon an examination of only 105 smokers of the 315 smokerswho participated in the study.339  The reseachers reported that 28percentto 67percent of these smokers experienced individual "withdrawalsymptoms."340<p>	Further, in the study, ]none of these "symptoms" was rated as"severe."  Indeed, on a scale of severity from 0 to 3 (0 = "none"; 1="mild"; 2 = "moderate"; and 3 = "severe") only two symptoms ("anxiety"and "craving") were rated "moderate," and three were rated less than "mild."Clearly, these minor "symptoms" are not characteristics of a meaningfulwithdrawal syndrome.  <p>	In fact, Hughes et al. concluded that these "withdrawalsymptoms" do not even predict the ability of a smoker to remain abstinent:  <p>"In the present study, neither the individual symptoms nor the total withdrawaldiscomfort during the first week or month predicted relapse at either 6-or 12-monthfollow-up.""fn717"  [341  <p><p>	Similarly, the Breslau study cited by FDA does not show that most smokers have"characteristic withdrawal symptoms."342  As discussed above, under DSM-III-R,four or more "symptoms" must be experienced by a smoker in order for thatsmoker to be said to have "nicotine withdrawal."  Using this standard, theBreslau study found that, out of the 61percent of smokers in the studywho claimed that they had tried to quit unsuccessfully, only 50percent --or about 30percent of all the smokers in the study -- "met the[DSM-III-R] criteria for nicotine withdrawal."343  Moreover, Breslau reachedthe same conclusion as Hughes: "Severity of withdrawal was]unrelated to the continuation ofsmoking....""fn722"  [344  <p>	FDA also cites the 1991 and 1992 National Household Surveys, and claims thatthe surveys found that "35% of smokers 25years of age or older who smokebetween 16 and 25 cigarettes per day reported experiencing withdrawalsymptoms."345  The Agency, however, does not provide the underlying data andmerely cites a second-handreport.  However, the "Main Findings" of the two surveys published by theDepartment of Health and Human Services provide data that contradict FDA'sclaim.  The Main Findings of the 1992 survey noted that 32.9percent ofsmokers age 26 to 34 who smoked a pack or more per day reported "withdrawalsymptoms" when they stopped smoking.  Only 25.3percent of smokers whowere age 35 or older and smoked a pack or more per day reported "withdrawalsymptoms" when they stopped smoking.346  The "Main Findings" of the 1991 surveyfound that 30percent and 26.3percent of the same groups,respectively, reported "withdrawal symptoms."347<p>	FDA further argues with respect to this "symptom" or "criterion" of"addiction" that smokers who compare the effects of nicotine with the effectsof addictive drugs find that the effects are comparable.348  This claim saysnothing about "withdrawal symptoms" and thus is irrelevant to the questionwhether most smokers exhibit withdrawal upon abstinence.349<p>	Finally, FDA relies on data from clinical research evaluating nicotinereplacement therapies.  Contrary to FDA's claims, these data do not "supportthe conclusion that a high proportion of smokers are addicted" or that mostsmokers exhibit "withdrawal symptoms."350  As discussed in greater detail inSection D below, the data from nicotine replacement studies do not show thatpeople smoke "nearly exclusively" for the pharmacological effects of nicotine --much less that most smokers are "addicted" to nicotine.  Moreover, the majorityof the clinical studies discussed by FDA did not even address "withdrawalsymptoms" other than craving.  ]<h3>2.		Smokers Do Not Smoke "Nearly Exclusively"</h3>		<b>To Affect Mood or To Control Weight Gain</b><p><p>	We address, in Volume II of these comments, FDA's allegations that peoplesmoke "nearly exclusively" to control weight gain or to affect mood.<h3>3.		People Smoke for Many Reasons</h3>		<b>Other ThanNicotine</b><p><p>	Contrary to FDA's claims, people smoke for a variety of reasons other than thepharmacological effects of nicotine, ranging from the flavor of tobacco smoke,to oral gratification, to the ritual associated with lighting and holding acigarette --and these reasons are not "secondary" to the pharmacological effects ofnicotine."fn728"  [351  Indeed, studies show thatpeople do not smoke "nearly exclusively," or even primarily, for the centralnervous system effects of nicotine. <p>	As one researcher recently stated:<p>"[I]t is often ignored that from a smoker's point of view, cigarette smokinginvolves much more than simply delivering nicotine to the brain.  Simply put,nicotine without smoke may be as unsatisfying as smoke withoutnicotine....  These studies lead to the conclusion thatconditioned reinforcing effects of sensory and motor aspects of smoking areimportant determinants of smokers' immediate subjective reaction to cigarettes;although nicotine delivery is important in the long-termmaintenance of cigarette smoking, the perceived CNS effects of nicotine in thedoses delivered from cigarette smoke are often subtle."352<p><p>	Even researchers who believe that smoking is driven by an "addiction tonicotine" recognize the complexity of smoking behavior and have noted the"apparent complexity and variation in individual reasons for smoking."353  AsDr.Jaffe has stated, "]cigarette smoking is more than nicotinedependence and once it is firmly established even nicotine itself cannotsupply all of the effects which the smoker associates with and seeks fromcigarette smoke.""fn743"  [354<p>	In 1984, the Surgeon General likewise concluded that "nonpharmacologic,sensory stimulation by factors such as the flavor of cigarette smoke may bemore important than nicotine in determining smoking behavior."355  As stated ina 1994 study, "the answer to the question of why people smoke continues to beelusive."356  <p>	Thus, FDA's "single factor model" of smoking -- ]i.e., thatsmokers smoke solely, or primarily, for the pharmacological effects of nicotine-- is undermined by numerous studies.  In fact,<p>"[e]vidence indicates that there are a number of important smokingmotivations and that their importance varies across individuals and situations.This fact is a challenge to single factor models of smoking.""fn749"  [357<p>]<h4>a.		Flavor and Sensory Responses</h4>	Cigarette manufacturers design, manufacture, and market cigarettes for smokingpleasure.  More than 1000 cigarette brand styles are available to consumers inthe U.S. marketplace."fn750"  [358  Consumers have awide choice along the spectrum of brand styles (]e.g.,full-flavor, light, ultra-light), but many individual brands of cigarettes havethe same nicotine yield.  If, as FDA alleges, smokers are simply smoking tosatisfy their "addiction" to nicotine, why does one brand sell substantiallybetter than another that yields the same amount of "tar" and nicotine to thesmoker?  Why do cigarettes have such a high brand loyalty?"fn751"  [359  <p>	The answer to both questions is quite simple, and it rebuts the Agency'sbelief that people do not smoke for the "taste characteristics of tobacco":360Although dozens of brands have identical "tar" and nicotine yields, each brandhas a unique combination of brand image and flavor, upon which smokersultimately base their choice of usual brand.  Thus, as researchers, includingDr.Henningfield, have concluded:  "][N]icotine yield is not astrong determinant of cigarette type/brand preference.""fn755"  [361  Cigarettes thus have a high brand loyaltybecause individual smokers experience and enjoy the desirable flavor attributespossessed by cigarettes of certain selected individual brands.<p>	Nevertheless, FDA attempts to minimize the important role of flavor tosmokers.  For example, the Agency describes the flavor of cigarette smoke withnegative connotations -- "harsh," "irritant," "unpleasant"362 -- to suggestthat no one would like the "flavor" of cigarette smoke.  FDA also claims that"flavor" plays only a secondary role in determining smoking behavior.  Thereported evidence, however, shows that FDA is wrong.<p>	]First, the concept of "flavor" (or "taste") is relatively complex.Although certain compounds evoke the classical sweet, salt, sour and bittertastes, the "flavor" of cigarette smoke -- like the flavor of other products --also comprises responses in the olfactory (aroma) and trigeminal sensorysystems ("throat grab").  One expert has described this phenomenon as appliedto cigarettes:<p>"The taste, pleasure, and satisfaction of a cigarette are a consequence of acomplex mixture of flavor, trigeminal sensation, and tactile effects.Definition of `cigarette taste' is difficult because of the very large numberof flavor notes which are a part of that taste.""fn757"  [363<p><p>In fact, research has demonstrated that nicotine in cigarette smoke providesolfactory (aroma) and trigeminal ("throat grab") stimulation that is enjoyed bysmokers.364<p>	]Second, although FDA emphasizes that the flavor of nicotine isharsh or irritating,"fn761"  [365 many foods --including vinegar, mustard, peppers, onions and radishes -- likewise possesscharacteristics and sensory attributes that are not commonly considered"pleasant" such as "pungent" or "bitter."366  Nonetheless, many people enjoythe taste of such foods.  Indeed, "A-1 Steak Sauce" is currently running anadvertisement in which a satisfied "customer" points to the back of his throat(where trigeminal nerve endings are located) and explains that he enjoys thepepper sauce because "it gets me right here."  <p>	]Third, research has shown that, contrary to FDA's implications,people do not smoke in spite of the flavor of cigarette smoke.  Rather,as researchers cited by FDA have stated, "cigarette smokers identify flavor asan important factor in the pleasure derived from smoking and for their choiceof cigarette brand.""fn763"  [367<p>	In fact, a number of studies have found that flavor sensations and othersensory responses to smoke in the nose, mouth and throat are important factorsdetermining whether people will smoke a cigarette.  For example,Drs.Levin, Behm, and Rose found that they could increase the smoker'sacceptance of cigarette substitutes, ]which did not containnicotine, merely by adding flavors (e.g., "menthol" and"mint") to the substitutes."fn764"  [368  <p>	The importance of flavor was also manifested in a 1990 study published byDrs.Boren, Stitzer, and Henningfield.  They had sought to determinewhether smokers' "brand loyalty" (buying and smoking only one brand ofcigarette for many years) was determined by the nicotine yield of the cigarettebrand.369  Eighteen smokers under double blind conditions were asked to choosefrom three research cigarettes with low (0.17 mg), medium (0.89 mg), and high(2.02mg) nicotine yields.  The researchers reported that the cigarettesall had "similar levels of other tobacco constituents."370 <p>	Contrary to the researchers' hypotheses, the study found that "[a]crosssubjects... the preferences which developed ]were notsignificantly related to nicotine yield....""fn767"  [371  Moreover, the "subjects' choicepreferences bore no clear relationship to the nicotine yield of their usualcigarette brand."372<p>	The authors concluded that <p>"]cigarette preference did not appear to result from preexistingindividual differences in preferred cigarette nicotine yield values becausethere was no consistent relationship between nicotine delivery ratings ofsubjects' usual brands and those of the cigarette types which they preferred inthe present study.""fn769"  [373  <p><p>The researchers concluded:  "]nicotine yield is not a strong determinantof cigarette type/brand preference.""fn773"  [374<p>	Researchers have also found that the sensory responses in the throatassociated with smoking are crucial factors in providing much of thesatisfaction from smoking.375  Conversely, the desire to smoke and thesatisfaction from smoking can be significantly reduced by blocking this sensoryeffect of cigarette smoke.  Studies have found that "blockade of most of thesensory qualities of smoke with lidocaine removed much of the satisfactionassociated with smoking."376<p>	Thus, as Dr.Rose has stated,<p>"[t]he view that inhalation of nicotine `boli' is responsible for the uniquelydesirable qualities of cigarettes to a smoker has been widely accepted]despite the absence of direct experimental support.  Theresults of our present study support an alternative account for the enjoymentand satisfaction reported by cigarette smokers, i.e., the conditionedreinforcing effects of the sensory feedback accompanying inhalation.  Whenthese cues were partially blocked (with local anesthesia) the satisfaction ofsmoking was blunted, despite the fact that equivalent boli of nicotine had beeninhaled.""fn779"  [377<p><p>	If the central effects of nicotine were the main reason for smoking, one wouldnot expect sensory stimuli to have such dramatic effects on smokingsatisfaction.  As Dr.Rose noted in another article, <p>"To the extent that smoking is a pharmacological habit, equivalent to nicotineself-administration,selectively removing the sensory qualities of smoke should not have a profoundimpact on the desire to light a cigarette."378 <p><p>Indeed, these findings<p>"underscore the similarity between cigarette smoking and other consummatorybehaviors such as eating and drinking, in which peripheral chemoreception playsan important role in satiety.  In contrast, self-administrationof other substances []e.g., heroin] often displays a lesscritical role for sensory cues associated with the route of ingestion.""fn785"  [379   <p><p>	Recently, NIDA conducted a study that compared the subjective effects of adenicotinized cigarette with those of regular cigarettes.  The researchersfound that "a ]de-nicotinized cigarette that did not increase plasmanicotine levels and had no cardiovascular effects [nonetheless] producedsubjective effects of liking and satisfaction.""fn788"  [380  The researchers concluded:]<p>"Taste and odor have long been understood to be important determinantsof smoking behavior....  Cigarette smoke delivers thousandsof compounds, including nicotine, that evoke strong conditioned associationsimportant for the maintenance of smoking.  Thus, both sensory aspects ofsmoking (e.g., taste, heat, odor, irritation), the conditioned stimuli, andnicotine delivery, the unconditioned stimulus, determine overall smokingbehavior.""fn791"  [381  ]<p><p>	In an effort to "explain away" the research that establishes the importance offlavor and other sensory aspects of smoking, FDA asserts the theory thatthese factors must act as "secondary" reinforcers."fn792"  [382  In an attempt to support this theory, FDArelies on three papers.  A careful reading of these papers, however,demonstrates that FDA has indefensibly converted what ]the authorsthemselves characterized as "theory" into an asserted fact.  In fact, theauthors of each paper expressly conclude that the secondaryreinforcement concept is only speculative."fn792"  [383<p>	For example, in 1993, Dr. Rose and his colleagues made the followingobservations:<p>"These results highlight the importance of sensory cues in the regulation ofsmoke intake and modulation of craving and suggest the clinical application oftechniques for providing relief of cigarette craving during smokingcessation.<p><p>	*  *  *<p><p>"Possibly the relevant sensory cues have become conditioned reinforcing stimulibecause they are usually correlated with nicotine intake and thereby produce aconditioned reduction in the desire to smoke.  Conceivably, sensory cues couldalso reduce craving through unconditioned mechanisms involving airway vagalreflexes.<p><p>	*  *  *<p><p>"Thus, the perception of adequate sensory feedback, whether in the oral ortracheobronchial regions, may be sufficient to limit smoking.  The probableimportance of sensory cues in the regulation of smoke intake may help resolvesome long-standing puzzles, including the finding that systemicallyadministered nicotine often has less effect on smoking behavior than one mightpredict."384<p><p>These hypotheses do not support the theory (presented by FDA as fact) that thesensory aspects of smoke are merely secondary to the pharmacological effects ofnicotine.  If anything, Dr. Rose and his colleagues have demonstrated thatsensory cues are critical to smoking satisfaction.  Their most recent findingscontinue to support this view.385]<h4>b.		Habit and Ritual</h4>	Smoking is also an habitual or "ritualistic" behavior, and "[a]ny attempt toexplain smoking merely as a nicotine dependence overlooks this dimension [ofsmoking behavior] entirely.""fn800"  [386  As oneresearcher recently stated:<p>"We should not neglect the complexity of behavior required by tobacco smoking.Behavior can, ]without any associated pharmacological reinforcement,be very compulsive and hard to abandon, e.g., nail biting.""fn801"  [387]<p><p>	There are a number of different aspects of the smoking "ritual":<p>"For instance, the cigarette smoked at breakfast time or during (and in orderto demonstrate) a work break undoubtedly has a ritualistic character.  Theseexamples are part of a normal, stable behavior and belong to our definition of'individual habits....'""fn802"  [388  <p><p>	Another article noted the important role that habit plays in defining smokingbehavior:<p>"Some people smoke for the pleasurable sensation gained from a cigarette, or asa `comfort habit' associated with the enjoyment of `handling' a cigarette.Having a cigarette can become a habit-- for instance a smoker mayroutinely have one with a cup of coffee or tea."389<p><p>	In effect, many smokers use smoking to "structure their daily life."390  Thishabit or ritual is not governed solely by the central nervous system effects ofnicotine.  For example, it was found in a 1993 study that the ritual in thesmoking habit determines the "favorite cigarette of the day," contrary to thehypothesis, deduced from a "nicotine addiction" theory, that the firstcigarette of the day (after a night of abstinence) would be the most preferred.The researchers found that a majority of smokers who were abstaining fromsmoking picked their "after-dinnercigarette"-- a cigarette not generally associated with "nicotinewithdrawal"-- as the cigarette they most missed; they did not pick the"first cigarette in the morning."391  Thus, when smokers "crave" a cigarette,"[i]t is conceivable that [the] mere termination of a behavior as repetitive assmoking could create an urge to sustain the behavior."392<p>	Another very recent study found that <p>"the reward value of smoking remains high ]even in the near absence ofnicotine availability and low task acceptability.  Together with the smallchanges in smoking topography, this points to the possibility that a fixedhabit of smoking at individually determined intervals constitutes an importantfactor beyond nicotine and taste for the maintenance of smokingbehavior.""fn811"  [393<p><p>In yet another recent study, the researchers noted that<p>"habituated temporal patterns play a role in cigarette smoking ]which isperhaps even more important than the need to maintain a constant plasmanicotine level.""fn815"  [394 <p><p>	The researchers concluded that<p>"taken together, these observations support the notion that ]thebehavioral aspects of smoking might be at least as important as nicotinefor the maintenance of the smoking rhythm.""fn816"  [395  <p>]<h4>c.		Social Aspects of Smoking</h4>	In addition to individualized habits, smoking plays a role in socialinteraction.  Many people smoke because they find that it facilitatessocializing and provides a social framework."fn817"  [396  One researcher has stated that "thephysical actions of holding the cigarettes..., tampingthe tobacco, striking matches, inhaling, and exhaling enables some persons tofeel comfortable in stressful situations."397  As stated recently,<p>"Perhaps the most underemphasized yet obvious reason why many smokers continueto smoke is that they derive pleasure from both the pharmacological effects ofsmoking and the social rituals that surround the act."398<p><p>Again, such factors are ignored by the "nicotine-addiction"hypothesis adopted as "fact" by the Agency.]<h3>4.	  Nicotine Intake and Cessation/Withdrawal</h3><b>	</b>	Further evidence that consumers do not smoke "nearly exclusively," oreven primarily, for the pharmacological effects of nicotine is found in studiesthat have considered nicotine intake or smoking amount as a predictor of asmoker's ability to quit.  As discussed in more detail below, most controlledstudies have failed to establish a correlation between nicotine intake andcessation success or withdrawal."fn821"  [399  It ishighly unlikely, therefore, that smoking behavior is "controlled" by nicotineor that consumers smoke "nearly exclusively" for the pharmacological effects ofnicotine.]<h2>J.	NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</h2>	<b>AND THE DESIRE TO SMOKE     </b><p><p>	FDA relies heavily upon studies regarding various nicotine replacementtherapies.  According to the Agency, these studies "support the conclusion thata high proportion of smokers are addicted [to nicotine].""fn832"  [400  The principal basis for this conclusionis the Agency's claim that nicotine replacement therapy in smokers "reducesrelapse rates."401<p>	]However, FDA has not provided the actual studies on which it reliesdespite specific requests by these commentors to do so.402  Because FDA hasimproperly relied on information which it has refused to place in the publicrecord, the data from these studies cannot form part of the record and must bedisregarded by the Agency."fn832"  [403  <p>	Nevertheless, we will comment generally on the issue of nicotine replacementstudies.  We first address nicotine replacement studies not relied upon by FDA.We then address the studies cited by the Agency.  Because we do not have accessto the complete data, this discussion is necessarily limited to the informationFDA has provided.<p>	Like all of the other "findings" in its Jurisdictional Analysis, FDA's use ofnicotine replacement studies is misleading and inaccurate.  Contrary to theAgency's spin on the facts, nicotine replacement studies show that smokers do]not smoke "nearly exclusively," or even primarily, for thepharmacological effects of nicotine.  <h3>1.	  Nicotine Replacement Therapies in General</h3>	Contrary to FDA's claims, a number of published studies report that nicotinereplacement has at most a marginaleffect on smoking behavior.  Thisfinding is significant because, if smoking behavior were controlled entirely,or even primarily, by nicotine's pharmacological effects, then providingnicotine to abstinent smokers should eliminate both their desire tosmoke and any "nicotine withdrawal" symptoms.  But that is not thefinding from the data.<p>	In one recent study, for example, subjects wearing nicotine patches smokedvirtually the same number of cigarettes as they had without the patch.  Theresearchers in that study concluded that "[t]he overall lack of effect ofnicotine patches on cigarette consumption is perhaps surprising and suggeststhat in regular smokers the lighting up of a cigarette is generally triggeredby cues other than low plasma nicotine levels.""fn834"  [404  <p>	In another recently published study, researchers found that the nicotine patchdid not have a significant effect on the smoker's subjective evaluation ofcigarette smoking.405  The researchers concluded that "smoking behavior isregulated by a complex array of physiologic and psychologic factors, includingplasma nicotine levels."406  <p>	The researchers further reported:<p>"[S]upplemental nicotine administration generally produced diminished smoking,although the effect was not robust.  Moreover, regulation of nicotine intakewas imperfect; ]regardless of the various plasma nicotine levels,smoking persisted at rates that increased plasma nicotine.  <p><p>	*     *     *<p><p>"These results and those of other studies emphasize that nicotine bloodlevels only partially regulate the behavior of smoking.""fn839"  [407  <p><p>Clearly, the pharmacological effects of nicotine are ]not the"nearly exclusive" reason for smoking.  <p>	Indeed, even when provided intravenous nicotine, some abstinent smokers stillwant to smoke."fn840"  [408  As Dr.Jarvik hasstated,<p>"experiments involving intravenous administration of nicotine do not duplicatethe effects of cigarette smoking nor do they produce a similar satisfaction insmokers.  Furthermore, they do not always produce a diminution in cigarettesmoking."409<p><p>	Further, the effects of nicotine replacement on "nicotine withdrawal" are alsolimited.  After reviewing several studies relating to smoking cessation,including those involving nicotine gum, Professor Collins, of the Institute forBehavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado, and a contributor to the]1988 Surgeon General's Report, concluded in 1990 that the<p>"findings are puzzling if the nicotine addiction theory is correct.  If humantobacco smokers are addicted to nicotine, partial reductions in blood nicotinelevels should reproducibly result in the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome;this syndrome should be more severe in totally abstinent individuals.Conversely, nicotine replacement should eliminate or minimize the mostsignificant withdrawal symptoms, especially craving.  As noted above, recentfindings do not uniformly reach these expectations; the data are not consistentfrom study to study.""fn847"  [410<p><p>	In a recent article, Tate ]et al. similarly noted that manynicotine replacement studies had found only a partial effect of the nicotinereplacement on purported "withdrawal symptoms":  "If nicotine is primary,then all symptoms should have been less severe when replacement nicotine wasadministered.""fn848"  [411  By contrast, all ofthe withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependentsubjects can be reversed by the administration of an opioid.412 <p>	Moreover, as a number of studies have demonstrated, the effects of nicotinegum have proven to be tied to the ]expectations of the smoker,rather than actual nicotine in the specific replacement therapy:<p>"Those subjects expecting nicotine gum reported a significant decrease inphysical symptoms, and significantly less smoking in the first week afterquitting....  Compared with the effects of expectancy, theactual gum that subjects received, either nicotine or placebo, appeared to haveno effect on either withdrawal symptoms or smoking behavior.""fn853"  [413  <p>]<h3>2.	  Studies Relied upon by FDA</h3>	Citing seven New Drug Applications ("NDAs") for nicotine replacement therapiesand certain studies submitted therein,"fn861"  [414FDA makes a number of statements about smokers in general.  For example, theAgency claims that these studies "support the conclusion that a high proportionof smokers are addicted."415  This and other broad conclusions made byFDA-- as well as FDA's interpretation of specific data-- are notsupported, and in some cases are actually contradicted, by the NDA studies.  <p>	]First, the Agency has refused to provide meaningful detail on thestudies and thus we and all other members of the public have been denied theright to provide meaningful comment on them.  On August31, 1995, wespecifically requested that FDA place in the record the studies and supportingdocumentation for all of the NDAs cited by FDA in its "JurisdictionalAnalysis"."fn861"  [416  FDA has refused to providethese materials.  As a result, neither the studies, the underlying data, northe analyses of the researchers who conducted the studies is available forreview.<p>	Instead, FDA has selectively placed limited portions of some (but not all) ofthe NDAs in this docket -- most of which are summaries of clinical studieswritten by FDA officials, rather than by the researchers who conducted thestudies.417  It is simply not proper to require the public to rely on FDA'ssecondhand summaries of data.  This is especially true in the case of thesenicotine replacement studies, which, for the most part, have never beenpublished and thus have never been subjected to independent peer review outsidethe NDA applicants -- who have an obvious conflict of interest in contendingthat their nicotine replacement therapy is effective -- and the Agency, whichhas approved these therapies and now seeks to use these studies as a basis toregulate tobacco products.  <p>	We have managed to obtain other relevant materials concerning some of thesestudies from other dockets.  Some of these materials -- such as statisticalreviews of the clinical studies conducted by FDA statisticians, which wereexcluded from this docket by FDA -- contain information that]contradicts the Agency's conclusions in its rulemaking notice.  Itis reasonable to believe that other relevant materials which FDA refuses todisclose will contain other information that undermines FDA's position.  Untilsuch materials are released, and we and other members of the public have had afair opportunity to review and comment upon them, these studies cannot beconsidered at all by the Agency in this rulemaking."fn861"  [418<p>	]Second, even FDA's summaries of these studies demonstrate that theAgency's attempt to draw general conclusions about the smoking population fromtheir reported results is invalid and inappropriate for a number of reasons.Most obviously, the subject populations were not representative of mostsmokers.  FDA acknowledges that the subjects of many of these studies wereselected specifically because they were deemed to be "highly dependent" onnicotine.  Most of the subjects smoked more than a pack of cigarettes per day.In fact, FDA itself concedes in its Clinical Study Summaries that some of thesestudies were deficient because all subjects smoked more than a pack ofcigarettes per day."fn862"  [419  Thus, a "finding"that a high proportion of dependence in a group of smokers who were selectedfor inclusion in a study sample specifically because they rated "high" on"dependency" tests is not surprising --but, just as clearly, a finding with respect to such a group cannot support aclaim that most smokers are "dependent."  <p>	Finally, none of the 19 nicotine replacement studies contained in the NDAs wasa large population study.  According to FDA, only two of the 19 had more than300 subjects, and 10 had fewer than 250 subjects.420  Clearly, the results ofthese limited studies are not applicable to the general smoking population anddo not support FDA's claim that a high proportion of smokers in general are"addicted" to nicotine.421  <p>	]Third, the cessation rates reported by the studies and the meaningof the data on cessation are questionable and do not support FDA's theory ofjurisdiction.  FDA claims that the results of the studies are "consistent" andthat the nicotine replacement therapies "reliably improved [the subjects']ability to stop smoking and to remain abstinent from cigarettes.""fn867"  [422  As shown below, however, the results ofthe studies are neither "consistent" nor "reliable."  The disparity in theresults of the studies suggests that factors other than nicotine are equal ormore important motivators than nicotine in either maintaining or quittingsmoking.  <p>	FDA also states that smokers "using nicotine replacement products (in thedosage range of 14 to 24 mg/nicotine per day) had an initial quit rate of about50%, twice that of smokers receiving placebo."423  FDA does not define "initialquit rate."  According to the Clinical Studies Summaries, however, only half ofthe studies using such nicotine replacement therapies had six week "quit rates"of 50percent for the active patch group.  More importantly,]initial quit rates are not indicative of the actual"success" of nicotine replacement therapies.  The long-termcessation rates for these studies were far less than 50percent.  In fact,only a small proportion of the smokers in these studies achieved long-termcessation even though they used nicotine replacement therapies.<p>	Again, these data suggest that for most smokers the absence or presence ofnicotine is not a decisive factor in maintaining or breaking their smokinghabit.  <p>	Further, the definitions of "success" or "quitting" used by these studies areambiguous and unreliable.  In many studies, a subject was considered to be"successful" if he or she was continuously abstinent for a period of 3 to 4weeks at any time in the study.  Thus, a "successful" subject couldsmoke for the first few weeks, quit for 3 to 4 weeks, and then begin again.FDA, itself, commented that this definition can lead to artificially highinitial quit rates:  <p>"[T]he initial two week `grace' period [i.e., the time period inwhich smoking was permitted] may create an artificial elevation of quitrates... when evaluating initial relapse rates, or could haveinfluenced the time course of other efficacy parameters.""fn867"  [424  <p><p>	In addition, the studies used only self-reportsand carbon monoxide validation (]i.e., measurements of CO atclinic visits) to determine whether the subjects actually abstained fromsmoking.  Self-reportingis notoriously unreliable, and CO measurements may not be accurate indicatorsof smoking, particularly when, as in most of these studies, the CO monitoringtakes place only every two to three weeks, which would allow subjects to smokein the intervening period without detection."fn867"  [425<p>	Finally, FDA does not provide necessary information regarding the "compliancestandard" for the studies.  In other words, for most of the studies, noinformation is provided about how the researchers determined whether a subjecthad followed instructions regarding the use of the nicotine replacementtherapy.  Whether the quit rates were the results of the use of nicotinereplacement therapies is thus unclear.<p>	]Fourth, in an effort to support its jurisdictional theories, FDAclaims that "[a]ll [participants] suffered withdrawal symptoms after smokingcessation."  In many studies, however, the issue of withdrawal was not evenaddressed-- at least not in the Clinical Study Summaries provided byFDA.  Indeed, the only "withdrawal symptom" that is discussed at length in thematerials provided by FDA is "craving," based on self-reportsof the subjects.  But, as discussed above, craving is not a valid indicator ofwithdrawal.  Further, as the studies themselves make clear, any "withdrawal"symptoms exhibited may be the result of factors other than nicotine.  Indeed,in one patient package insert approved by FDA, the manufacturer stated that:<p>"[R]eduction in craving, as with quit rate, is quite variable.  Thisvariability is presumed to be due to inherent differences in patientpopulations, e.g., patient motivation, concomitant illnesses,number of cigarettes smoked per day, number of years smoking, exposure to othersmokers, socioeconomic status, etc., as well as differences among theclinics.""fn871"  [426<p><p>	Finally, there is no indication in these studies that "withdrawal symptoms"caused subjects to resume smoking.  As noted above, studies have found thatcessation success is not inversely related to "withdrawal symptoms."<p>	Aside from these general problems, FDA has also mischaracterized specific datafrom the studies.  The following is a review of the individual studies based onthe data we have been able to review in the face of FDA's refusal to providemeaningful and complete data.   ]<h4>a.	  Nicorette Gum (2 mg) -NDA 18-612</h4><b>	</b>	FDA has refused to provide a single document relating to theNDA for this product.  Nevertheless, FDA's discussion in Appendix1regarding two studies suggests that these studies do not support FDA'sclaims."fn871"  [427]<h5>	(i)	  Christen Study</h5>	According to FDA, the Christen study consisted of only 191 subjects."fn871"  [428  No information is provided about thecharacteristics of the subject population, except that the subjects wereselected on the basis of their desire to quit smoking and that they had anaverage of 15-17 years smoking experience.  As noted above, smokers who seekprofessional help to stop smoking are not representative of the general smokingpopulation and often rate higher on scales of "dependence."  In the informationFDA has provided about the Christen Study, there is no indication of anypurported "withdrawal symptoms" or how many cigarettes the subjects smoked perday.  <p>	"Success" in this study was determined to be a four-weekperiod of abstinence during the first six weeks of the study.  In other words,subjects could have smoked during the first two weeks or last two weeks andstill be considered "successes."  FDA has not provided the necessaryinformation to confirm or refute this apparent deficiency in the study data.<p>	FDA claims that at six weeks 38percent of the subjects using the activegum had quit compared with 12percent using the placebo.  FDA has providedno information, however, as to the eventual long-term success of the subjects.Indeed, in other studies of the 2mg nicotine polacrilex, researchers havefound that smokers using the placebo have had similar success rates as smokersusing the active gum.429  <p>	Moreover, even FDA's figures show that 62percent of the subjects in the]Christen study had not quit, despite the use of the nicotine-replacementproduct.  Those smokers --nearly two-thirdsof the study population --plainly were not smoking to maintain a blood nicotine level.  The Christenstudy thus provides strong evidence against FDA's thesis that mostsmokers smoke to maintain an "addiction" to nicotine.<h5>(ii)	  Russell Study</h5><b>	</b>	According to FDA, there were only 116 subjects in this study."fn874"  [430  FDA has provided no information aboutwhether any of the subjects had "withdrawal symptoms" or how many cigarettesthe subjects smoked per day.  Further, the subject population is identifiedonly as "volunteers seeking to stop smoking."431  No information has beenprovided about the classification of "success."  It is impossible, therefore,to provide any analysis of the data; and FDA's claim that 48percent ofsubjects using the active gum met a one-monthabstinence rate, while 24percent of subjects who received the placebo hadquit, is thus meaningless.  ]<p><b>	</b>	Again, even FDA's figures show that 52percent of the subjectshad not quit, despite the use of the nicotine-replacementproduct.  Those smokers --more than half of the study population --plainly were not smoking to maintain a blood nicotine level.  The Russell studythus provides strong evidence against FDA's thesis that most smokers smoke tomaintain an "addiction" to nicotine.<h4>b.	  Nicorette Gum (4 mg) --NDA 20-066</h4><b>	</b>	FDA discusses two studies that compare a nicotine gum containing4mg of nicotine with gum containing 2mg.  However, relatively fewstudies have found that the 4mg gum results in higher success rates thanthe 2mg gum.  FDA, itself, has stated that "only one of the fourpublished studies [submitted by the manufacturer in theNDA]... provided evidence that the 4mg Nicopred wasbetter than the 2mg Nicopred in highly dependent smokers.""fn874"  [432  This result suggests that increasing thedose level of nicotine in the gum has little effect, and that abstinent smokersare less influenced by nicotine than by other factors involved in smokingbehavior.]<p><b>	</b>	Neither of the two studies (one published and one unpublished) citedby FDA provides data that support the Agency's contrary contention thatnicotine is the critical determinant in the smoking habit.  <h5>(i)	  Tonnesen (1988)</h5>	This study involved only 173 subjects who were "motivated to quit smoking.""fn874"  [433  The results of the study show an increasein quit rates among one subset of the subjects:  "highly dependent" smokers whoreceived gum containing 4mg of nicotine.  However, there was no placeboor control group among these so-called "highly dependent" smokers-- whichwas the only group of subjects in this study that showed a statisticallysignificant increase in rate of success.434  Moreover, after six weeks, thisgroup was no longer "blinded."  The quit rate, therefore, may be attributableto the subjects' knowledge that they were receiving active gum.<p>	Further, clinic visits to confirm "cessation" were held only at weeks0,1, 2, and 6 during the initial 6-week treatment period.  Smoking thus couldhave occurred during weeks 3-5.  Follow-up confirmation of "success" by COmonitoring was conducted only at 12 months and 24 months.  Thus, some of theparticipants could have smoked during the intervening time period withoutdetection.  <p>	Indeed, some of the participants in the "active treatment" group may not havebeen using the gum at all, further skewing the results:  "All subjects whoattended the first group session were included in our calculation of theresults of this study, even though some were absent from sessions and]some did not use the nicotine gum at all.""fn882"  [435<p>	FDA, itself, criticized the definition of "smoking cessation" used in thisstudy, and required the manufacturer to submit additional data:<p>"[T]he definition of smoking cessation used in [the Tonnesen] study was notcompatible to that used in the labeling of the currently marketed 2mgNicopred.  A meeting with the sponsor Kabi Pharmacia was held on 3/12/91.  Atthat meeting, the sponsor was informed of the deficiencies and was advised toprovide other data from either published or unpublished studies that comparedthe 4mg with the 2mg Nicopred gums.  Failing that, a new study willbe needed to provide the support of the 4mg Nicopred claim."436<p><p>	Finally, there is no information about "withdrawal."  Thus, FDA's claim thatall subjects in all studies exhibited "withdrawal"437 is simply not supportedby the data provided.  ]<h5>(ii)	  Merrell Dow Study</h5>	The subjects of this study -- one of the larger ones in terms of number ofparticipants -- were not representative of the general smoking population.  AsFDA, itself, has admitted, subjects were selected on the basis of highFagerstrom scores."fn885"  [438  In other words, thesubjects were selected specially because they were classified as "highlydependent smokers."439  Two-thirdsof the subjects smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day.440<p>	In any event, the results of this larger study do not show that the absence orpresence of nicotine is very important.  FDA reports that "of the 563 enrolledpatients, 56/184 were successful with placebo (30%), 62/190 with 2mg(32%), and 75/189 (39%) with 4mg."441  In its own review of this study,FDA acknowledged that these data ]"did not reveal any statisticallysignificant differences among treatment groups [i.e., the active patch groupand the placebo group] in either study group though there was a trend infavor of the Nicopred 4mg group for the overall results.""fn887"  [442  Indeed, these data suggest affirmativelythat even smokers classified as "highly dependent" do not smoke to maintainnicotine blood levels.<p>	When the 289 "compliant" subjects (]i.e., subjects who usedthe gum according to directions) were considered separately, there was areported statistically significant difference between the smokers who used2mg and 4mg gum.  But when the subjects are grouped according toindividual study/clinical centers, only two of six centers show a largeincrease in abstinent rates with the 4mg gum over the 2mg gum.  Theother four study centers show a higher or equal success rate for the 2mggum.  In fact, three of the six centers had higher or virtually equalsuccess rates for the placebo group.443  This result strongly suggests thatthe slight differences in success rates may have been attributable to factorsother than the nicotine in the gum, such as counseling provided at a specificclinic."fn887"  [444<p>	Once again, FDA's figures show that approximately two-thirdsof the treated subjects had not quit, despite the use of the nicotine-replacementproduct.  Those smokers, like their counterparts in the studies previouslydiscussed in this section, plainly were not smoking to maintain a bloodnicotine level.  The Merrell Dow study thus provides strong evidence]against FDA's thesis that most smokers smoke to maintain an"addiction" to nicotine.<p>	In its Evidence for Efficacy Review, FDA also stated that baseline CO leveland the number of attempts to quit "were slightly<p> lower in the 4mg group than in the 2mg group.  The impact ofthese two factors on the success rates were [sic] unknown.""fn891"  [445<p>	Further, this study lasted only six weeks-- far less than necessary todetermine any real effect of nicotine replacement therapy.  FDA noted thisdeficiency in the Evidence for Efficacy Review: "Shortcomings of the studydesign include... the lack of follow-upbeyond the 6 week study period."446  Moreover, "success" was defined ascomplete abstinence for only the last four weeks of the study; and, even forthat short period, there was no confirmation that the subjects were abstinent,other than self-reporting and two CO breath tests at weeks 4 and 6.  Thus, even"successful" subjects could have smoked throughout the study.<p>	Finally, although FDA claims that all subjects in all of the NDA studiesexhibited "withdrawal symptoms," there is no information about smokers in thisstudy experiencing any individual "withdrawal symptom" aside from"craving."]<h4>c.	  ProStep -NDA 19-983</h4><b>	</b>	The ProStep NDA provided FDA with four "efficacy trials."  All four ofthese studies had three limitations which make their results inapplicable tothe general smoking population.  First, the subject populations were limited topeople who smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day."fn892"  [447  Second, subjects were permitted to smokeduring the first two weeks of the six-weekstudies,448 which as discussed above, leads to inaccurate results.]<h5>(i)	  Study 88-01</h5>	This study compared a 22mg patch with a placebo.  This was only an80-subject study."fn893"  [449  Furthermore, although80 subjects were enrolled, only 74 completed week 6, and only 54 completed thefull 14 weeks.450<p>	In any event, this study ]contradicts FDA's statement that"[s]mokers using ... nicotine replacement products (in the dosagerange of 14 to 24mg/nicotine per day) had an initial quit rate of almost50%, twice that of smokers receiving placebo.""fn893"  [451  As even FDA states, the initial "quitrates" (weeks 3-6) for this study of a 22mg patch were only20percent for the active patch group, and 13percent for the placebogroup.452  The Agency does not try to reconcile these results with its claim ofa 50percent initial quit rate.  ]More importantly, the Agencyfails to mention that the difference between the quit rates for active andplacebo groups was not statistically significant.453<p>	FDA further claims that the "quit rates" at week 14 of the study(13percentvs. 8percent) were statistically significant,but FDA's own Clinical Study Summaries state that the difference between theactive and placebo groups was not statistically significant.454<p>	Once again, FDA's figures show that large numbers of the treated subjects hadnot quit, despite the use of the nicotine-replacementproduct --whether the percentage of treated nonquitters was 80percent or50percent.  Those smokers, like their counterparts in the studiespreviously discussed in this section, plainly were not smoking to maintain ablood nicotine level.  Study 88-01thus provides strong evidence against FDA's thesis that smokers smoke tomaintain an "addiction" to nicotine.<p>	There is no discussion of any reported "withdrawal symptoms" for this specificstudy.  Again, FDA's claim that all subjects in all studies exhibited"withdrawal" does not appear to be supported by the facts."fn893"  [455]<h5>(ii)	  Study 88-02</h5>	This study consisted of 263 subjects.  The study compared a 22mgnicotine patch with a placebo patch.<p>	Initial quit rates (at six weeks) are cited by FDA in Appendix1 as being15percent for ProStep and 11percent for placebo."fn894"  [456  However, FDA's Clinical Study Summariesstate that the quit rate was 15percent for the active patch group and12percent for the placebo group.457  These are certainly not the "50%initial quit rates" that FDA claims.  Moreover, although FDA claims in Appendix1 that this difference was statistically significant,458 the quit rates arevirtually identical.  According to the Clinical Study Summaries, which did notstate that this difference was statistically significant, the p-value was0.86.459 <p>	Indeed, the data from this study directly ]contradict FDA's claimthat the two-folddifference between active treatment and placebo was maintained throughout afull year of follow-up."fn894"  [460  In this study,the 52 week quit rates were ]lower for the group receiving theactive patch: 6percent active drug and 8percent placebo."fn894"  [461<p>	Here, too, the large number of subjects who were treated with a nicotine-replacementproduct and who nevertheless continued to smoke-- 85percent --directly contradicts FDA's claim that most smokers smoke to maintain a bloodnicotine level.  Study 88-02thus provides strong evidence ]against FDA's thesis that mostsmokers smoke to maintain an "addiction" to nicotine.<p>	Finally, as with Study 88-01, there were no reported "withdrawal symptoms" --and no support for FDA's claims that all subjects in all studies experienced"withdrawal."<h5>(iii)	  Study 90-01</h5>	FDA claims that this was a 235-patient study."fn894"  [462  Actually, 240 smokers]enrolled, but only 197 completed the 8-week study."fn894"  [463  The study compared a 22mg patchwith a placebo.  Subjects received nicotine replacement for only 8weeks,but were "followed-up"after the patch was removed.<p>	The initial quit rates for subjects receiving the active patch are much lowerthan FDA's claim of 50percent:464  The quit rates at six weeks were33percent for subjects with active patches and 15percent for theplacebo group.465  Further, as with the other ProStep studies, FDA fails tomention that subjects who smoked during the first two weeks of this study were]not considered failures.466  Thus, the quit rates may not measurecomplete abstinence.<p>	Contrary to FDA's statement that all patients in the study experiencedwithdrawal, the study actually reported that "severe withdrawal symptoms" werenoted in only a very small number of the subjects-- even in thosesubjects receiving the placebo.  The most frequent "symptoms" were"anxiety/nervousness" and "impatience/restlessness," which occurred in only15percent of the subjects receiving the placebo.  The only other"symptoms" reported as "severe" and occurring in 10percent or more ofeither the active or placebo groups were "awakening at night" (11percentin the active patch group) and "anger, irritability, and frustration"(10percent in the placebo group)."fn894"  [467Further, although "craving" was considered, it was measured solely by thesubjects' reported "desire to smoke."468<p>	Moreover, FDA stated:<p>"Lacking a weekly by-centerbreakdown of craving score, it cannot be assumed that a significant drug effectin craving exists independent of center."469<p><p>Thus, FDA's claim that all subjects exhibited withdrawal is apparently limitedto mild "symptoms" that may have been unrelated to nicotine and have had noimpact on the outcome of overall quit rates.<p>	Finally, yet again, two-thirdsof the treated subjects continued to smoke.  This study thus adds to theevidence that it is untrue that most smokers smoke to maintain blood nicotinelevels.]<h5>(iv)	  Study 90-03</h5>	FDA states that this was a six week, 260 patient study."fn898"  [470  In fact, this was an 8week study,in which 277subjects enrolled, but only 165 completed the full8weeks.471  <p>	The initial quit rate was not the 50percent claimed by the Agency:  Atweek6, 24percent of the active patch group and 15percent ofthe placebo group were abstinent.472  ]In fact, at week8, the quitrates were 15percent and 13percent, respectively; the differencebetween the rates was not statistically significant.473  (FDA does notreport the week 8 results in Appendix1.)  <p>	There were no "withdrawal symptoms" rated as "severe" by 10percent ormore of either the active or placebo patch groups."fn898"  [474  Further, a follow-up at 26 weeks showedthat 3percent of the active group ]and 7percent of theplacebo group had quit.  Again, the vast majority of treated smokerscontinued to smoke.  Thus, this study counts as evidence against FDA's position.<h4>d.	  Nicotrol -NDA 20-150</h4><h5>(i)	  Tonnesen Study</h5>	This study was conducted in Denmark, and thus may not be applicable to smokersin the United States."fn902"  [475  The study used a15mg patch and was conducted at a single center.476  The study consideredthe effect of the active patch for 12weeks.  <p>	The initial quit rate in this study-- 35percent for the activepatch477 -- is not the 50percent initial quit rate that FDA claimsnicotine replacement therapies (in the dosage range of 14 to24mg/nicotine per day) achieve.  Nor is that figure consistent with FDA'sclaim that most smokers smoke to maintain blood levels of nicotine.<p>	Further, the "success" rates may be inaccurate because "slips" were permitted:"Patients were withdrawn if they resumed smoking (]more than justslips) at some week after the first.""fn903"  [478  The definition of a "slip" is notprovided.  Moreover, "success" was defined as abstinence in the last five weeksof the first six weeks of the study.  Smoking thus was allowed during the firstweek.<p>	In addition, the long intervals between follow-ups(which took place at weeks1, 3, 6, and 12), make the results ambiguous atbest.  As FDA, itself, stated in its summary of this study:<p>"Follow-upwas not done weekly over the first six weeks.  Although self-reportingappeared to be reliable, ]additional CO measurements might havevalidated the success rate better.""fn903"  [479<p><p>	Compliance rates (]i.e., whether subjects actually wore thepatch) were low, yet there is no explanation as to how this phenomenon affectedthe outcome of the study."fn904"  [480  And nowithdrawal symptoms were reported or studied other than craving.  Finally, inan especially telling concession, FDA noted that "[a]lthough the reviewerslooked for evidence of dose-responsein the success rate, none could be found."481  Again, there is little or nosupport in this study for the Agency's nicotine-plasma thesis.]<h5>(ii)	  Sachs Study</h5>	FDA states that 215 subjects participated in this study."fn906"  [482  In reality, 220 people]started the study, but by the end of week 6, 19percent of theparticipants receiving active patches and 31percent receiving the placebohad dropped out.  By the end of week 12, the dropout rates were 24percentand 33percent, respectively."fn906"  [483  <p>	According to the Statistical Review (which was not provided by FDA), thisstudy "had a two-weekrun-inperiod during which subjects with poor motivation were weeded out."484  Thisloss of subjects, of course, would bias the outcome of the study.<p>	As in the Tonnesen study, "slips" apparently were allowed:  "Patients werewithdrawn if they resumed smoking (]more than just slips) at someweek after the first.""fn906"  [485  Moreover, follow-upswere not conducted for weeks4 and5.486  Thus, a subject could havesmoked during those weeks and still been classified as a successful quitter.As with the Tonnesen Study, FDA noted in its critique of this study that<p>"[f]ollow-upwas not done weekly over the first six weeks.  Although self-reportingappeared to be reliable, ]additional CO measurements might havevalidated the success rate better.""fn907"  [487<p><p>	It also appears that noncompliance (]i.e., failure to wearthe patch) was quite high.  Yet there is no indication whether someone whofailed to wear the patch would be considered a "success" or "failure."<p>	Finally, the only "withdrawal symptom" discussed was craving.  The measurementof craving was based solely on self-reportsof smokers and thus may not have been accurate.<h4>e.	  Habitrol -NDA 20-076</h4>	In the "Statistical Review" of the Habitrol studies (which was not put in therecord), the FDA reviewer made lengthy criticisms of the three Habitrolstudies.  Although the reviewer ultimately found that there was somestatistical significance in the results of the study, the criticism calls intoquestion the fundamental reliability of these studies and suggests that FDA cannot rely on them to draw conclusions about the general smoking population: <p>"The analyses and presentations of the three protocols by the sponsor should beconsidered as the best case scenario.  This is because there were manychanges and modifications of the protocols during the course of thestudies.  For example, the increase in sample size from 200 to 296 was amajor concern to this reviewer in terms of the interpretation of the results.The sponsor's explanation is not entirely satisfactory.  The original samplesize of 200 was carefully calculated based on 80% power of detecting a 20%difference in quit rates between [active patch] and [placebo].  The sponsorclaimed that no interim analysis was performed and decided to increase thesample size of 296 so that there would be sufficient number of patients withinthe time frame of the protocol.<p><p>"This reviewer found it difficult to understand the rationale unless therewas a belief that the observed difference (unknown during study) between[active patch] and [placebo] was smaller than expected.  If one limits theresults to the first 200 patients in each protocol, only Protocol 06 retainsthe statistically significant difference between [active patch] and[placebo].""fn908"  [488<p><p>	As discussed below, the mid-coursechange in population size had a significant impact on two of the studies.]<h5>(i)	  Study 06</h5>	FDA claims that there were 273 subjects in this study."fn909"  [489  In fact, only 209 completed week7and only 187 subjects completed the entire 10 week study.490  The subjects werenot representative of the general smoking population: subjects were selectedbecause they were classified as "highly dependent."491  Subjects also smoked atleast a pack of cigarettes per day.492  FDA, itself, criticized the studybecause of "the absence of subjects who smoked less than 1pack/day or whohad a Fagerstrom tolerance score &lt;6 at baseline."493 The study was only 10weeks long-- a fact that FDA also noted was a "limitation."494  <p>	Success was based on self-reportingof abstinence for any 4consecutive weeks during the first 7 weeks of thestudy and was confirmed by CO measurements.495  Subjects who smoked during theother 3 weeks could have been considered "successes."496<p>	As many as 17percent of the active patch group did not "comply" withinstructions.497  How this rate of noncompliance affected the outcome of thestudy, however, is simply not addressed.<p>	FDA cites statistics showing the percentage of subjects who were abstinent atcertain points in time (]e.g., week 3, week 4,week6)."fn916"  [498  These statistics showthat at the fourth week of the study, 50percent of the subjects who wereusing the active patch were abstinent, compared with 33percent of thesubjects who were using the placebo.  However, in the Clinical Study Summary,FDA]<b> </b>acknowledged that the 7 week quit rate was a more conservative(and, presumably, more accurate) measure of the quit rate.  That quit rate was39percent for the active patch group compared to 24percent for theplacebo group."fn916"  [499  Thus, once again, mostof the smokers receiving nicotine-replacementtherapy continued to smoke.  Plainly, contrary to FDA's position, these smokerswere not smoking to maintain blood nicotine levels.]<h5>(ii)	  Study 07</h5>	FDA claims that 243 subjects took part in this study."fn916"  [500  However, only 160 completed week7,and only 125 completed the full 10weeks.501<p>	As with Study06, the subjects of this study were not representative ofthe general smoking population-- the subjects were "highly dependent" andsmoked a pack or more per day.502  Indeed, as with Study06, FDA, itself,noted that this study was limited because of the failure to include subjectswho smoked less than one pack per day or had Fagerstrom scores of less than 6.<p>	Study07 was also limited to 10weeks.  In addition, as inStudy06, the "success" rate was based on self-reportswith periodic CO measurements, and was defined as 4weeks of abstinenceduring a 7 week period.<p>	According to the FDA's Clinical Study Summaries, the "success rate (anyconsecutive 4 of the first 7weeks per protocol) was 37% for [the activepatch] compared to 26% for [the] placebo...."503  This is notthe 50percent figure claimed by FDA.  Moreover, as with Study 06, themore "conservative" (and more accurate) quit rate measured at 7 weeks was32percent for the active patch and 21percent for the placebo.504None of these numbers comes close to supporting FDA's claim that smokers smoketo maintain an "addiction" to nicotine.<p>	Further, when subjects were grouped according to the four individual treatmentcenters which participated in the study, only two of the four groups had anysignificant increase in the quit rates of subjects receiving the active patchcompared to subjects receiving the placebo.  In fact, one treatment centergroup had ]higher quit rates for subjects using the placebo, andanother treatment center group had only a 1percent difference between thesubjects using the active patch and those using the placebo."fn919"  [505 <p>	At least 13percent of the active patch group did not comply with theinstructions to use the patch; but there is no indication how thisnoncompliance affected the outcome of the study.506  <p>	In the Statistical Review (which was not provided to the record by FDA), theFDA reviewer stated that "[t]he results of this protocol were not as strong asthose of Protocol 06 mainly due to the inconsistent finding of oneinvestigator."507  The reviewer also commented on the mid-studychange in population size:  "[i]f one had limited...theanalysis to the first 200 subjects as planned, the results would have beenfurther weakened."508<p>	Finally, as in so many of the other studies, the only "withdrawal symptom"mentioned in the Clinical Study Summary is "craving."]<h5>(iii)	  Study 08</h5>	FDA states that 276 subjects participated in this 10week study."fn922"  [509  In fact, only 193 completed week7and only 166 subjects completed the entire 10weeks.510  Further, like theother Habitrol studies, Study08 included as subjects only "highlydependent" smokers and smokers who smoked a pack or more of cigarettes perday-- subjects who plainly are not representative of the general smokingpopulation.511<p>	FDA states that the quit rates were "significantly greater [with the patch]than for placebo ]at 4 weeks in this study.""fn923"  [512  There are, however, two significantproblems with this claim.  ]First, at week4, the "quit rates"were 26percent and 16percent, respectively, which is not the50percent figure claimed by FDA.  Second, the 4week point isthe only point in time at which there was a statistically significantdifference between patch and placebo quit rates in this study.  As stated byFDA in the Clinical Study Summary, "although numerically superior throughWeek8, the differences in quit rates between [the patch and placebogroups] are statistically significant only at Week4.""fn923"  [513 <p>	The results show that at week10, 13percent of the subjects whoused the active patch and 11percent of the subjects who used the placebowere abstinent-- a statistically insignificant difference.  Further,using the study's own definition of "success"-- abstinence during "anyconsecutive 4 of the first 7weeks per protocol"-- only21percent of the active patch group and 12percent of the placebowere "successful."514  As with Studies 06 and 07, FDA noted that a more"conservative" quit rate measured at 7 weeks was 17percent for the groupreceiving the active patch and 13percent for the group receiving theplacebo.515]<p>	Again, FDA's 50percent initial quit rate claim -- and itssuggestion of a significant difference between active nicotine and placebotreatment -- are belied by the facts.<p>	In addition, the same problems concerning compliance rates and definition of"success" discussed above regarding Studies 06 and 07 are present in thisstudy.  In fact, in the Statistical Review (which was not provided to therecord by FDA), the Agency's reviewer wrote,<p>"[t]his protocol appeared to be quite sensitive to the different definitions ofsuccess.  For example, using the protocol definition of success, the differencein quit rates of [one] investigator... was 12% in favor of[active patch] but was 2% in favor of [placebo] instead with the modifieddefinition . . . Overall, the magnitude of difference was reduced from 10%to 4% in favor of [active patch], a non-significantdifference.""fn925"  [516<p><p>	As with the other studies, "craving" was the only reported "withdrawalsymptom."<p>	Finally, unlike the other two Habitrol studies, there was no "group therapy"or counseling for subjects in Study08.  The lower quit rates for thisstudy suggest that group therapy-- not nicotine replacement-- was asignificant reason for quit rates in these nicotine replacement studies.]<h4>f.	  Nicoderm -NDA 20-165</h4>	All participants in the Nicoderm studies discussed by FDA weresmokerswho smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day."fn925"  [517  As discussed above, FDA, itself, hascriticized studies limited to such smokers.  <p>	As in other studies, "success" was defined as total abstinence over the last4weeks of the study.  Smoking was permitted in the first two weeks.518FDA criticized this aspect of the studies:<p>"In Studies 010 and 011, ]the initial two week `grace' period may createan artificial elevation of quit rates at Week3 when evaluatinginitial relapse rates, or could have influenced the time course of otherefficacy parameters.""fn926"  [519<p><p>	Further, FDA, itself, has stated that Studies 010 and 011 were "limited"because "[t]hese studies were not designed to permit an assessment of thecontribution of the behavioral support program to the overall success rate orwhether some subset of patients might be as likely to quit without thebehavioral support program."520]<h5>(i)	  Study 010</h5><b>	</b>	FDA claims that 403 subjects finished week6 and were eligiblefor continuation."fn928"  [521  In fact, only 265were eligible for continuation.522  The subject population was notrepresentative of the general smoking population:  Subjects smoked from one totwo packs of cigarettes per day.523  ]<p><b>	</b>	Although "withdrawal" symptoms were reported by some of the subjects,there was "[n]o attempt ... to separate the signs and symptoms ofnicotine withdrawal from events relating to the adverse effects of the nicotinefrom the patch.""fn929"  [524]<h5>(ii)	  Study 011</h5><b>	</b>	FDA states that there were "390 evaluable patients" in this study."fn930"  [525  In fact, only 282 subjects completedweek6 (the primary efficacy period).526]<p><b>	</b>	Although "withdrawal symptoms" were reported by some subjectsthere is no indication that all subjects reported "withdrawal symptoms."Indeed, the only "symptom" discussed in detail in the Clinical Study Summarieswas craving, which a number of subjects did not report at all."fn930"  [527  In addition, as FDA stated, "[n]o attemptwas made to separate the signs and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal from eventsrelating to the adverse effects of nicotine from the patch."528  Finally, FDA'sown analysis notes that the "craving data support ]a hypothesis thatthe substitution of nicotine from the patch reduces withdrawal symptoms.""fn932"  [529  But, as FDA adds, "[t]here isconsiderably less dose response in this measure than in quitrate."530]<h5>(iii)	  Study 005</h5><b>	</b>	The subject population of this 155-subjectstudy consisted of "mostly male" patients with coronary artery disease, who onaverage were 50-60 years old, smoked an average of one and a half packs ofcigarettes per day, and had a 38-yearsmoking history."fn934"  [531  The subjects wereselected in part because they were "highly dependent."532  Clearly, the resultsof this study cannot be applied to the general smokingpopulation.533]<p><b>	</b>	FDA acknowledges that, although "withdrawalscores... trended higher for placebo patients," the results"were not significant.""fn938"  [534  Further, "[n]oattempt was made to separate the signs and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal fromevents relating to the adverse effects of the nicotine from thepatch."535]<h4>g.	  Nicotine Nasal Spray --NDA 20-385</h4><b>	</b>	According to FDA, nicotine nasal spray is the nicotine replacementtherapy that most closely resembles a cigarette "in terms of speed andintensity of nicotine absorption.""fn938"  [536  TheAgency has reviewed three "pivotal studies" regarding nicotine nasal spray.]Yet, FDA has not provided this docket with a single document relatingto this NDA.  It is thus impossible to provide meaningful comments on thesestudies, and the Agency may not rely upon them in any final rule. <p><b>	</b>	Nevertheless, the following general comments can be made about thesenicotine nasal spray studies based solely on the limited information providedby FDA:<p>(1)	  The subjects of the studies do not represent the general smokingpopulation:  FDA states that the subjects smoked 1 to 11/2 packs of cigarettesper day."fn938"  [537  <p>(2)	  The studies were small:  they consisted of fewer than 300 subjects.538<p>(3)	  Although initial 4-week quit rates appear to range from 49percentto 58percent in the subjects using the nasal spray (compared to21percent to 32percent in the placebo group), the quit rates at theend of one year ranged from only 24percent to 27percent for theactive group.539  Clearly, these studies show that smoking behavior is]not dominated by the effects of nicotine.  Indeed, these studiesare powerful evidence against FDA's claim that smokers smoke "nearlyexclusively" to maintain nicotine blood levels.<p><b>b.	</b>  <b>Fiore Meta-Analysis</b><p><b>	</b>	In addition to the studies submitted with the NDAs, FDA cites a meta-analysisby Fiore"fn941"  [540 to support the Agency's claimthat nicotine replacement studies find an "initial quit rate of about 50%,twice that of smokers receiving placebo."541  Fiore's meta-analysis does]not find comparable quit rates.  Rather, the analysis showed that"overall abstinence rates for the active patch were 27% (vs 13% for placebo) atthe end of treatment and 22% (vs 9% for placebo) at 6 months.""fn943"  [542  Individual studies reviewed in theanalysis found quit rates ranging from 14.4percent to 69percent foractive patch groups and 4.9percent to 51.2percent for placebogroups.543  ]<p><b>c.	</b>  <b>FDA's Meta-Analysis</b><p>	FDA concludes its discussion of the NDA studies with its own meta-analysisof the studies.  The Agency "pooled" the results of the studies to create agraph, which was subsequently published in the Federal Register, andpurports to show a continual increased quit rate for the nicotine replacementgroup compared to placebo over a one year period."fn946"  [544  This meta-analysisis misleading and scientifically inappropriate.<p>	]First, FDA has not provided the methodology used to conduct itsmeta-analysis. The weight given to each study (despite the differences in the length of thestudies, their "success" criteria, and population groups) is not made clear.FDA thus has failed to provide "sufficient details to permit scientificevaluation."  21C.F.R. [[section]]860.7(c)(2).  Therefore, theAgency has not subjected its meta-analysisto peer review or provided a meaningful opportunity for comment on its graph.As a matter of law, the results cannot be used in this rulemaking."fn946"  [545  <p>	]Second, a meta-analysisis appropriate only when the studies that are pooled are designed and conductedsimilarly.  As discussed above, the NDA studies had many differences in designand conduct-- e.g., with respect to the length of the studyand criteria for "success".  Some studies permitted smoking "slips"; others didnot.  Some studies required abstinence during a consecutive 4-week period;others required abstinence for longer periods.  Further, only a very fewstudies ran for a full year, and those that did find only a minimal differencebetween the quit rates for the active and placebo groups --and in some cases the placebo group had higher long-termquit rates than the active group.  These are not the results that FDA suggestsin its graph.  <p>	Third, a meta-analysisis less reliable where there are wide variations in the data from individualstudies.  As shown above, there are substantial disparities among the resultsof the individual studies.<p>	Fourth, even if one accepted the meta-analysisand assumed that the data represented the general smoking population (which, asdiscussed above, they do not), the results show that at most only a smallportion of people smoke to maintain blood nicotine levels: at 12 months,25percent of the subjects who used nicotine replacement had quit smoking,but 10percent of people who used the placebo had also quit.  Assumingarguendo that all of the 15percent difference representspeople who smoke solely or primarily for nicotine, that most assuredly is not"nearly exclusive" use of cigarettes to obtain nicotine.<p>	*          *          *<p>	Surely, if nicotine were the only, or even the primary, reason for smokingbehavior, nicotine replacement therapy would have much higher and much moreconsistent success rates.  The majority of smokers, however, either quitwithout nicotine replacement or continued to smoke despite nicotinereplacement.  These smokers cannot be considered "addicted" or "dependent on"nicotine.  The results of these studies thus show affirmatively that nicotineis not the principal determinant of smoking behavior.<h2>K.	THERE ARE NO DATA TO SUPPORT FDA'S POSITION THAT</h2><b>	THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN COMMERCIAL CIGARETTES CAUSE</b><p>	<b>"ADDICTION" OR HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL PHARMACOLOGICALEFFECT</b><p><p>	FDA proclaims that "[s]cientific studies demonstrate thattobacco products currently marketed in the United States contain and deliversufficient levels of nicotine to produce pharmacological effects on the centralnervous system.""fn947"  [546  FDA misses the point:As discussed above, even if FDA had evidence of therapeutic claims (which itdoes not), the issue here is not ]whether nicotine merely has someeffect on the structure or function of the body.  Rather, the issue is whethernicotine has a substantial effect.  Thus, establishing that a specificlevel of nicotine elicits any response is irrelevant to the issue of FDAjurisdiction."fn947"  [547]<h3>1.		Studies Cited by FDA for the Proposition That</h3><b>		Certain Amounts of Nicotine Produce "Pharmacological</b><p>		<b>Effects" Do Not Support FDAJurisdiction&nsp;</b><p><p>	FDA argues that commercial cigarettes yield enough nicotine to"produce a physiological response in the central nervous system.""fn947"  [548  In an attempt to support this claim, FDAcites a number of studies which purport to establish that specific amounts ofnicotine elicit certain physiological responses (such as changes in EEGreadings) or cause some measure of "reinforcement" in laboratory animals.  Thestudies FDA cites, however, do not establish that levels of nicotine have asubstantial effect on the structure or function of the body.  To the contrary,the studies merely show that, in a few limited circumstances, researchers havebeen able to determine a minimal response in laboratory animals and a smallnumber of human subjects to specific levels of nicotine.  <p>	For example, FDA cites one study for the proposition that the level ofnicotine necessary to produce "pharmacological effects" ]in humansis 0.18 mg."fn947"  [549  FDA does not explain whatit means by "pharmacological effects."  The study, however, was primarily areinforcement (or self-administration)experiment ]using laboratory animals.550  <p>	The animals in this study were four rhesus monkeys.  The monkeys "werepreviously experienced in self-administrationof drugs....""fn947"  [551  Asdiscussed above,552 such animals are more likely to "self-administer"substances than animals who have not been trained to perform in similarexperiments.  The researchers found that self-administrationmay occur in these trained animals at nicotine levels of 2.5ug/kg.553However, the researchers' conclusions regarding humans were based solely onassumptions:  <p>"[T]he dose to reinforce human smokers ]was simulated under theassumption that all factors correlate linearly.""fn952"  [554<p><p>That ]assumption, however, is incorrect.  The differences betweenRhesus monkeys and humans do not permit a valid "calculation" of the dose ofnicotine necessary to produce self-administrationin humans-- let alone the dose necessary to produce a "substantial"effect.  FDA's conclusion that 0.18mg of nicotine causes "pharmacologicaleffects" in humans thus is nothing more than an hypothesis. <p>	Further, as discussed above, the fact that, under specific conditions,laboratory animals may self-administernicotine does not mean that nicotine has a substantial effect on the body or is"addictive."  Indeed, the researchers cited by FDA, themselves, acknowledgedthat the "reinforcing effect" of nicotine was "substantially weaker than thatof the principal drugs of abuse, such as opiates or cocaine.""fn953"  [555<p>	FDA claims that another study found that the "minimal pharmacological dose [ofnicotine] was reported to be 0.2 mg for the average adult."  Again, however,the research does not support this broad claim.  To begin with, FDA does notdisclose that this study merely found that subjects in a nicotine nasal spraystudy were able to "identify" nicotine at a dose of 3.0 ug/kg.556  Theseresults do not establish that 0.2mg is the "minimal dose" of nicotine foran "average adult" to experience a "pharmacological effect" for a number ofreasons.<p>	]First, there is nothing in the study indicating that the subjectsrepresented the "average adult" -- whatever that is."fn957"  [557  Indeed, there were only 18 subjects, allof whom were smokers.558 <p>	]Second, 50percent of the male subjects were not ableto "identify" nicotine at the dose level of 3.0ug/kg.  The results, thus,were no greater than "chance."  Moreover, FDA does not explain how itdetermined that the male subjects who did not "identify" nicotine (50%of the male subjects) were not representative of the "average adult."  <p>	Third, as FDA acknowledged, only 30percent of the female subjectswere able to correctly "identify" the nicotine at 3.0ug/kg."fn960"  [559  This demonstrates a ]lack ofability to "identify" nicotine.<p>	Fourth, the ability of a person to "identify" nicotine in nasal spraydoes not represent a "substantial" effect on the structure or function of thebody-- and certainly does not demonstrate that nicotine is "addictive."Even the lead researcher in this study has conceded that the ability of asubject to "identify" a substance is not the equivalent of a finding that thesubstance produces "dependence.""fn960"  [560Further, any "identification" of nicotine in the nasal spray could well havebeen based on chemosensory perceptions (]i.e., trigeminal andodor responses) in the nose.  <p>	Finally, FDA cites a number of studies which claim to find that specificlevels of nicotine elicit certain EEG effects.  As discussed at length above,however, the ability of a substance to evoke EEG responses does not establishthat the substance has the requisite substantial effect on the structure orfunction of the body.<h3>2.		There Is No Valid Empirical Evidence</h3>		<b>Establishing an "Addictive" Level of Nicotine</b><p><p>	As FDA's Advisory Committee determined, there are currently no consistent datafrom controlled studies to support any "threshold" level for either nicotineyield per cigarette or total daily nicotine intake by a smoker as a meaningfulpredictor of "addiction"-- by any definition of that term.""fn961"  [561  ]<h4>a.		There Is No Valid and Consistent</h4><b>			Empirical Evidence That There Is a</b><p><b>			Correlation Between Nicotine Intake</b><p>			<b>and Cessation Success or Withdrawal</b><p><p>	If nicotine were the sole, or even the primary, reason forsmoking behavior, there should be a correlation between a smoker's nicotineintake and the smoker's ability to quit smoking.  Most controlled studiesfocusing on nicotine intake and cessation success/failure, however, havenot established such a correlation.  As a 1994 article in the Journalof the American Medical Association stated:<p>"Despite much research, accurate and consistent predictors of successfulsmoking cessation have not been identified.  Variables that have provenpredictive in some studies do not predict in others, and when predictiverelations are found, they are modest.""fn962"  [562<p><p>	That 1994 ]JAMA article went on to note that "measures that arehypothesized to reflect nicotine dependence... have predictedtreatment success weakly and inconsistently.""fn965"  [563  The authors further stated that theirown<p>"analyses cast some doubt on the ability of numerous accepted or hypothesizedmeasures of tobacco dependence to predict success or failure consistently forpatients using the nicotine patch.  ]Baseline indicators, such as thenumber of cigarettes smoked per day, Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnairescore, and years of smoking, were poorly and inconsistently correlated withsuccessful cessation.  Biochemical measures also fared poorly aspredictors: pretreatment expired CO value, pretreatment blood nicotineand cotinine levels, absolute blood nicotine and cotinine levels achievedon the nicotine patch, and the percentage replacement of pretreatmentnicotine or cotinine with nicotine patch therapy were poorly and inconsistentlycorrelated with successful smoking cessation.""fn966"  [564<p><p>	A number of other studies over the past decade have similarly concluded thatthe number of cigarettes smoked or overall nicotine intake is not related tocessation success/failure.565  For example, one 1993 study found that althoughheavier smokers may be more reluctant to quit, "once they make the attempt theyare as likely to succeed as lighter smokers, when other factors are keptconstant."566  Another 1992 study similarly found a "]complete lack ofpredictive power" for, among other things, "smoking duration andintensity.""fn982"  [567  A 1990 study found that"30% of both succeeders [successful quitters] and relapsers were heavysmokers."568  <p>	The absence of consistent empirical data correlating nicotine intake andcessation failure/success is also evident in the 1994 editorial by Drs.Benowitz and Henningfield in the ]New England Journal of Medicine,which, prior to the Advisory Committee meeting in August 1994, was a focus ofCommissioner Kessler's initiative against cigarettes."fn986"  [569  Drs.Benowitz and Henningfieldacknowledge that there are no data supporting such a threshold "dose" ofnicotine.  As they state in one of their "caveats",<p>"A threshold level for nicotine addiction is a ]theoretical conceptbased on observations in current smokers and studies of the bioavailability ofnicotine during smoking restriction.  That restricting levels of nicotinewould prevent addiction needs to be verified empirically.""fn987"  [570<p><p>Indeed, as Drs.Benowitz and Henningfield acknowledge, <p>"Of course, there is no sharply demarcated threshold level, and there are somepeople who smoke fewer than five cigarettes per day and have great difficultyin quitting and others who can smoke more than five cigarettes per day and quitwith ease."571  <p><p>	Thus, the empirical data do not support any "threshold" level of nicotine as ameaningful predictor of cessation success/failure, much less as a predictor ofnicotine "addiction."<p>	In addition, as discussed above, a number of studies have found that the levelof nicotine intake is not related to the "severity" of so-called "nicotinewithdrawal."572  For example, in 1992 Dr.Hughes found that, "as in mostprior studies..., withdrawal severity did notdiffer... between heavy and light smokers."573  Similarly, in1985 Drs. Hatsukami, Hughes, and Pickens found that there were "inconsistentrelationships between the various measures of nicotine intake and measures oftobacco withdrawal."574<p>	Given these data, there is no basis for determining that any specific level ofnicotine is "addictive"-- much less that ]all cigarette brandsdeliver "addictive" levels of nicotine.<h4>b.		The DAAC Concluded That a "Threshold"</h4>			<b>Dose of Nicotine Cannot Be Determined</b><p><p>	The issue before the DAAC on August2, 1994 was whether athreshold level or "addictive dose" of nicotine could be determined."fn1006"  [575  According to Commissioner Kessler, "ifsomething affects the structure and function of the body, if it's to beconsidered a drug, we need to ask the question, if there's information on thedose at which it affects the structure and function of the body."576  DespiteCommissioner Kessler's request, however, ]not a single member of theAdvisory Committee was able to determine a threshold level.<p>	First, the Advisory Committee members were asked whether there is "adaily dose of nicotine from cigarettes and other tobacco products below whichaddiction is very unlikely?  If so, what is that dose?"  The Committee,however, concluded that the data do not support any answer:<p>&#176;	"I'm uncomfortable with -- I didn't hear evidence that lets me answerthis question clearly.  My suspicion is that there probably is some sort ofthreshold dose for an individual below which dependent use is unlikely todevelop.""fn1008"  [577<p>]<p>&#176;	"And I think the data are not available yet to identify whether ornot the dose that's used by the long term chippers such as those Shiffman hasstudied will be predictive of a threshold dose for other individuals who may bepotential cigarette either users or dependent users.  So, whereas I thinkthere is most probably a dose for which an individual user will not progress todependent use, I don't think we have anywhere near the body of evidencenecessary to begin to talk about what that dose may be.""fn1009"  [578<p>]<p>&#176;	"The issue that concerns me isn't the information and the data in thestudies that I've heard, it's what I haven't heard.  That's why I'm notcomfortable making a decision here.  But I would like to add that I'm verysuspicious of arbitrary limitations.""fn1010"  [579<p>]<p>&#176;	"I basically concur with Dr.Young's remarks.  I think that thereprobably is a dose below which addiction is unlikely.  I don't know what thatdose is....""fn1011"  [580<p>]<p>&#176;	"I would have to concur with Dr.Young.  Although theoretically Iwould assume that there may be a dose, again I have not heard enough data totell me that there is or what that dose is; so I don't have enoughinformation to answer that question....  I have not heardenough or read information to tell me that such a dose exists.""fn1012"  [581<p><p>	In fact, Dr.Gerald acknowledged the complexity of the issue and statedthat "]years of study" probably would not resolve it:<p>"I believe there is, in fact, some threshold dose.  What that dose is, I don'tknow.  I would ask that the committee not hesitate to engage in years ofstudy to determine what that dose is.  I think it's important, becauseafter years of study we probably won't be that further ahead than we aretoday, to determine what a safe dose is in all the people all the timeunder all conditions.""fn1013"  [582<p><p>Dr.Meisch, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee agreed:<p><p>"My thought is that there is a subthreshold dose; that's true with many othermeasures in pharmacology, and ]I agree with many of my colleagues thatwe do not have at this point in time we do not have enough information tospecify what that is.""fn1014"  [583<p><p>	]Second, the Advisory Committee members were asked whether there is"a daily dose of nicotine from cigarettes and other tobaccoproducts... above which addiction is very likely?  If so,what is that dose?""fn1015"  [584  Again, theCommittee was unable to provide an answer:<p>"First of all, I'll answer the second part first:  ]Idon't know ofany dose at this point with the knowledge we have.585<p><p>	The DAAC thus recognized that the questions put to them on the supposed"threshold" amount of nicotine necessary to sustain some definition of"addiction" required substantial further analyses.  Nevertheless, the DAAC hasnot been convened to consider this issue further."fn1016"  [586  ]<h3>3.		Nicotine Yields from Currently</h3>		<b>Marketed Products</b>p><p>	In an obvious effort to explain away the fact that many smokers are quiteloyal to brands of cigarettes that yield very little nicotine, FDA claims thatmany smokers of low-yieldcigarettes actually obtain higher "doses" of nicotine than indicated by thepublished FTC numbers."fn1018"  [587  This argumentis based on the phenomenon commonly referred to as "compensation."  Indeed, theAgency claims that currently marketed cigarettes with an FTC yield of 1mgof nicotine can yield to the consumer a "dose" of nicotine ranging from 0.3 to3.2mg of nicotine. <p>	The sole support for this claim, however, is an "editorial" co-authored byDrs.Benowitz and Henningfield, in which the authors make the]unqualified assertion that <p>"[t]he variation in intake per cigarette is considerable...ranging from 0.3 to 3.2 mg... depending on how the cigaretteis smoked.""fn1021"  [588<p><p>According to Drs. Benowitz and Henningfield, therefore, a person who smokes acigarette that typically delivers about 1mg of nicotine can increase thenicotine yield of that cigarette to 3.2 mg -- an increase of220percent.<p>	This 220percent compensation assumption, however, is ]notbased on valid empirical data.  Rather, Drs.Benowitz and Henningfieldrefer to two articles authored by Dr.Benowitz as the sole support fortheir 220percent figure.  One of those articles reported that, undercertain test conditions, the nicotine derived by a group of smokers ranged from33percent to 155percent of the yields derived by the FTCmethod."fn1022"  [589  Quite apart from the fact thatthis range simply brackets the FTC-predicted yield and, in fact, averages to alittle ]less than the FTC number, the 155percentmaximum is less than half the 220percent figure used by Drs.Benowitz and Henningfield.  <p>	The other article authored by Dr.Benowitz (the "support" for the 220percent claim) does state that one person smoking a singlecigarette which yielded 1mg of nicotine as measured by the FTC methodapparently derived 3.2 mg of nicotine from that one cigarette (whileother smokers derived as little as .37mg from the 1mg cigarettethey were given to smoke).  But Dr.Benowitz, himself, acknowledged thatthe conditions of that particular study were extremely artificial and probablyresulted in an excessive amount of compensation:<p>"It is likely that the unusually high level of nicotine intake in oursubjects reflects the fact that the subjects (who had not smoked for theprevious 10-12hours) knew that they could smoke only one or two cigarettes during the next 12hours.  When access to cigarettes is restricted, cigarette smokers canincrease their per-cigarette smoke intake by threefold or greater.Presumably this is what was occurring in our cigarette-deprived volunteers,despite instructions to smoke naturally.  In addition, our subjects smokedthese cigarettes through a cigarette holder (part of the smoke dosimeter),which is an unnatural way to smoke and could have influenced smokingbehavior and nicotine intake.  Effects of tobacco abstinence, either beforetesting or anticipated after testing, and the use of cigarette holders onsmoking behavior should be considered by other investigators.""fn1023"  [590<p><p>	FDA -- and the courts which have reviewed its decisions -- have long warnedagainst the use of even a group of anecdotal reports.  It is therefore simplyabsurd for the Agency to attempt to formulate a ]general view ofsmokers' nicotine intake or the "yield" of cigarettes on a single report thatone smoker-- who had been deprived of cigarettes for 10-12 hoursand had been told that he would not be allowed to smoke another cigarette for12 more hours--might have derived an excessive amount of nicotineby smoking one cigarette in an "unnatural way."  In fact, the data donot support such an extreme view.  <h4>a.		If "Compensation" Occurs at All, It Is Typically</h4>			<b>Limited in Degree, and of ShortDuration</b><p><p>	To be sure, some researchers have contended that smokers "compensate"for lower yields by altering their puffing behavior in order to increase theyield of nicotine from low-yield cigarettes, by blocking ventilation holesplaced in filters to cause more smoke to be drawn per puff, or, in a few cases,by increasing the number of cigarettes smoked per day."fn1026"  [591  Yet, although studies examining"puffing" or ventilation holes may be able to measure smoking]behavior, they do not measure smokers' actual nicotine intake.Without accurate measurements of smoke absorption, it is difficult to gauge thedegree of compensation, if any. <p>	On this rather obvious point, even Commissioner Kessler agrees: "What'srelevant is how much nicotine and nicotine metabolites end up in the body'splasma when a human smokes.""fn1027"  [592  Thus,according to Commissioner Kessler and others, rather than measuring puffingbehavior, a more accurate way to determine whether "compensation" occurs is toconsider biological markers that have an association with nicotine, such ascotinine.593<p>	For a variety of reasons, the most commonly employed indicator of anindividual's absorption of nicotine has been the level of cotinine, ametabolite of nicotine, in his or her blood or plasma. The metabolism ofnicotine is complex, however, and the cotinine (or other nicotine metabolite)levels of different persons exposed to the same amount of nicotine may varysubstantially.  ]<h5>(i)	 	"Tar" and Nicotine Intake Decrease</h5><b>				When People Smoke Cigarettes with Lower</b><p>				<b>FTC MethodYields.&bsp;</b><p><p>	The most carefully conducted studies to date have tended to finddirect and linear relationships between actual intake and FTC method yield.Even those researchers who report finding some compensation conclude thatsmokers consume lower quantities of "tar" and nicotine when they smokecigarettes with lower yields as measured by the FTC method."fn1030"  [594 <p>	According to Dr.M.A.H. Russell, for example, despite some apparentcompensatory behavior by some smokers of lower-yieldcigarettes, "their intake of the three major smoke components [includingnicotine] [is] still lower [than that of smokers of higher-yieldcigarettes] ]to a statistically and clinically significantdegree.""fn1031"  [595  In other words, evensmokers who may appear partially to compensate while smoking lower-yieldcigarettes still have a significantly lower intake of "tar" and nicotine.596<p>	A 1992 study of the plasma cotinine levels of 125 smokers similarly showedthat cotinine levels varied directly with the yield of nicotine (as measured bya smoking machine) in the cigarettes they smoked.  "The findings revealed alinear correlation between daily nicotine intake and serum levels ofcotinine...."597  The study concluded that smokers didnot compensate when smoking low nicotine cigarettes and compensated onlypartially when smoking ultra-low-yieldbrands.598<p>	In 1988, Drs.Zacny and Stitzer conducted a brand-switching study tocompare the cotinine levels of smokers using high, medium, low, and ultra-low-yieldcigarettes, as measured by the FTC method.  The cotinine levels of the smokersof ultra-low-yieldcigarettes were significantly lower than the levels in smokers of medium-yieldcigarettes; and, in turn, the cotinine levels in the smokers of low-yieldcigarettes were significantly lower than the levels in smokers of high-yieldcigarettes.  Thus, it was apparent that smokers did not fully "compensate" forlower nicotine yields.599<p>	A 1990 study of 170 male smokers likewise found that plasma nicotine andcotinine concentrations "appeared to increase progressively with increasingnicotine yield of the cigarette."600  The study found "linear relationshipsbetween plasma nicotine or cotinine concentrations and the cigarette yield insmokers consuming filter cigarettes...."601  A 1986 studysimilarly found that the nicotine yield of cigarettes correlated significantlywith plasma cotinine levels; this correlation showed a linear relationshipbetween the reported FTC yield and the plasma cotinine measures.602]<h5>(ii)	  Compensation Is at Most</h5>				 <b>a Short-Term Phenomenon</b><p><p>	Most studies using cotinine as a biological marker have foundthat, although some smokers may vary their intake of tobacco smoke, it appearsthat "compensation" in these smokers occurs only partially-- if atall-- and then only for limited periods of time."fn1067"  [603  As even Drs.Benowitz andHenningfield -- perhaps the leading proponents of the "compensation" theorytoday -- have stated, compensation appears to be temporary:  <p>"[O]vercompensation (]i.e., inhaling more smoke fromlow-nicotine cigarettes than from higher-yield brands) appears, however, topersist only for days or weeks.  In long-term studies of carbon monoxideexposure after subjects switched to lower-yield cigarettes, compensatoryoversmoking appears not to persist.""fn1078"  [604<p><p>	Thus, even if there is some "compensation," a smoker reduces his actual intakeof nicotine after switching to a reduced-nicotinecigarette; and long-termuse of low-or ultra-low-yieldbrands of cigarettes thus cannot serve to maintain some "nicotine addiction."]<h5>(iii)	  Compensation May Occur for</h5>				  <b>"Tar," NotNicotine</b><p><p>	Finally, many so-called "compensation" studies are based on theassumption that smokers "compensate" solely to obtain higher yields ofnicotine.  Yet, researchers who have varied the yield of the tar, but notthe nicotine, of cigarettes have found that this assumption may not betrue.  For example, in one 1993 study, the authors switched 12 smokers frommedium-to low-yieldcigarettes.  The smokers compensated while smoking low tar/low nicotinecigarettes, but did not compensate while smoking medium tar/low nicotinecigarettes."fn1079"  [605  The authors concluded that"gustatory and olfactory sensations, which are supposed to be more dependent ontar than on nicotine yield, may play a greater role for the regulation ofsmoking behavior than hitherto believed."606  Indeed, the researchersconcluded, <p>"under the conditions of the present experiment, which allowed gooddifferentiation between the nicotine and tar yield effects of a cigarette, areduction in tar yield appeared to be more important for compensatory smokingbehavior than a reduction in nicotine yield."607  <p><p>Thus, even if compensation occurs, it has not been shown to be a productsolely, or even largely, of some need to regulate nicotine intake.]<h4>b.		Vent Blocking, If It Occurs at All, Is Not</h4>			<b>Used To Compensate for Lower Nicotine Yields</b><p><p>	In a further effort to avoid the obvious fact that many smokersare loyal to low-and ultra-low-yieldbrands, which yield very little nicotine, the Agency claims that the ventilated"filter design provides a means of compensating for reductions in nicotinedelivery" by the ability of smokers to block ventilation holes."fn1087"  [608 Relying on a single 1980 publication byKozlowski ]et al.609 FDA contends that "32 to 69% of low-tarcigarette smokers block the perforations in ventilated cigarettes.""fn1087"  [610  To support its claim, the Agencyselected the ]highest figures ever reported.  In addition, FDA'sclaim is not supported by Kozlowski's later work or by other published data.To the contrary, as discussed below, the available data show that ventblocking, if it occurs at all, is an inconsistent phenomenon in relatively fewsmokers.  Under no credible theory can vent blocking by a limited number ofsmokers be used to show that smokers smoke to maintain blood nicotine levels.<h5>(i)		The 1980 Kozlowski Paper Is Not the</h5><b>				Best Available Evidence Concerning Vent</b><p><b>Blockingnbsp;</b><p><p>	The 1980 study by Kozlowski et al., cited by FDA, apparently wasbased solely on interviews with an unknown number of smokers.  The authors didnot report any actual measurements or data.  The authors claimed that amanuscript documenting the study was in preparation, but no study with datamatching or supporting the "32 to 69percent" claim has ever beenpublished to our knowledge, and the authors make no reference to those figures,nor to such a manuscript in their later publications on the same topic.<p>	Indeed, a 1994 publication co-authored by Kozlowski further calls intoquestion the validity of the claims in the 1980 paper.  Specifically, the 1994publication states:<p>"previous research with ultralight cigarettes has demonstrated that somesmokers engage in vent blocking.  To date, no data exists on the prevalence ofvent blocking on light cigarettes.... ""fn1088"  [611<p><p>	It thus appears that Dr.Kozlowski's claim that "32 to 69% of low-tarsmokers block the perforations" -- the claim (based on unpublished data) whichthe Agency now eagerly embraces -- therefore must refer ]only toultra-light smokers, not to the broader range of all "low-tar"smokers.  Ultra-light (0-6 mg "tar") cigarettes made up 8.1percent of thecigarette market in 1980 and "light" (7 to 15 mg) cigarettes made up40.4percent of the market."fn1089"  [612Thus, even if Dr.Kozlowski's 32-69percent observation were valid --and there is no way to know since his data have never been published -- it atmost refers to a small number of ultra-low-"tar" smokers.  <p>		]<h5>(iii)	The Reported Incidence of Vent Blocking</h5>				<b>Is Much Lower Than That Claimed by FDA</b><p><p>	The intentional or unintentional blocking of ventilation holes duringsmoking is a phenomenon that could occur to some extent.  FDA attempts to playthe intentional or unintentional argument both ways by alleging that ventblockage is a means "of compensating for reductions in nicotine delivery," yetalso stating that "[t]he behavior is not unexpected because some smokers areunaware of these ventilation holes or their function, and because the holes aregenerally tiny ... and difficult for the smoker to see.""fn1090"  [613  The frequency or degree to which anyvent blocking occurs, however, is not clear; and conclusions regarding otherthan a very small percentage of smokers cannot be drawn from the reports in theliterature. <p>	Studies by Kozlowski and others subsequent to the 1980 paper cited by FDA showa far ]lower prevalence of vent blockage than estimated from the1980 Kozlowski interviews.  Table1 summarizes the results of fivepublished studies (those listed in the bibliography of the NCI Conference onthe FTC test method held in December 1994) in which "used" filters fromventilated cigarettes were categorized by visual inspection of the stainpatterns on the mouthends of filters:<p>	INSERT CHART<p>	The largest of these studies (Zacny et al.) examined 1631filters of ultra-low "tar" cigarettes.  The study found that "[o]nly 0.1% wereidentified as completely vent-blocked, whereas 72% were rated asunblocked.  The remaining 28% [of the filters] were rated as partially blocked(6%) or placed in a questionable category in which the discrimination betweenunblocked and partially blocked was difficult (22%).""fn1090"  [614  The authors noted that the"]present study provided little evidence for consistent ventblocking.""fn1091"  [615<p>	Combining the data from the above studies shows an overall range fromapproximately ]4percent of examined filters that were judgedby the researchers to be totally "blocked" to approximately29percent of filters that were judged partially "blocked."  FDAignored all of these published data and instead relied selectively and solelyon the unreliable 1980 Kozlowski article -- a report that the authors,themselves, apparently discount.  FDA's discussion does not represent a fair orimpartial consideration of the data.<h5>		(v)	The Determination of Vent Blocking in</h5><b>				Any Event Is Subject to Question and</b><p>				<b>Overestimates thePhenomenon</b><p><p>	The estimates of the incidence of vent blocking must also be considered inlight of the serious difficulties in measuring the phenomenon.  The authorscited in Table1 and others who have studied vent blocking admit todifficulties in observing vent blockage and categorizing "used" filters by thestain pattern:<p>"44% appeared partially blocked but were impossible to judge with anyconfidence....  Our sample was not drawn at random and ourmeasurement techniques are open to error.""fn1093"  [616 <p><p>	*    *    *<p><p>"The mean accuracy of correct labeling of the 10 unblocked cigarette buttswhich subjects smoked without a holder was only 37%, or little better thanchance....  82% of unblocked cigarettes smoked by subjectsthrough holders were correctly labelled ....  This findingunderscores the need for rigid control in the preparation and standardizationof cigarette butts in evaluating ventilation hole blockingaccuracy....  Holders may have affected smokingpatterns....  It is possible that, even with trainedraters, the detection of ventilation hole blocking in smokers may prove]too unreliable to be useful.""fn1096"  [617<p><p>Referring specifically to the 1980 Kozlowski article now cited by the Agency,Lombardo ]et al. report:<p>"Kozlowski et al. (1980) recently suggested that partial,complete and no blocking of ventilation holes can be readily discriminated bydistinctive stain patterns of tar deposits on cigarette butt ends.Unfortunately, their study did not empirically test this assertion.Furthermore, discriminability was predicted on the basis of machine smokedstain patterns rather than those of actual smokers.  This leads to questionsregarding whether individuals' idiosyncratic smoking topographies (Moss &amp;Prue, 1982) produce more variable and, therefore, less discriminable stainpatterns than machine smoked butts.  A second question raised ...involves the method of hole blocking.  Kozlowski et al.'s (1980)partially blocked cigarettes were blocked as if two opposing fingers covered50% of the holes.  However, during the course of smoking a cigarette, smokersmay switch the holes they cover as they move the cigaretteabout....""fn1097"  [618<p><p>	It is thus probable that all published data on vent blockage]overestimate the number of filters with blocked vents.  In anyevent, a better method of observing and measuring vent blockage is necessary tojustify any vent blockage claims.<h5>(vi)	  Difficulties in Data Interpretation</h5>				 <b>Further Undermine the Reliability</b><p>				 <b>of theResults&bsp;</b><p><p>	The methodologic difficulties do not stop there.  Any effort to drawconclusions about vent blocking is further limited by other difficulties indata interpretation.  The authors of the studies discussed above readilyacknowledge that there are a number of difficulties in conducting this type ofresearch.  <p>	Smokers obviously do not smoke each cigarette during the day in the same way.These facts raise a number of significant questions that must be addressedbefore attempting to draw conclusions from the published data:<p>&#176;	Would the subjects of the above-citedstudies have smoked the cigarettes differently if they had been alone in theirown living rooms rather than in a laboratory or other unfamiliar setting in thepresence of a stranger (i.e., the interviewer)?  The availabledata suggest that this factor may significantly influence the results.  Forexample, the Zacny study used filters from cigarettes that subjects wereallowed to smoke during their usual daily routine.  The findings of blockagesin that study were lower than the results of Kozlowski's 1980 interviews, andwere also lower than the results of other studies that did not allow smokers tofollow their daily routines.  <p><p>&#176;	Would the subjects have smoked the cigarettes differently if thecigarettes had been their own brands rather than the cigarette given to them?Again, an affirmative answer seems likely given that many of the subjects wereprovided cigarettes quite different from their own.<p><p>&#176;	How frequently does a "blocker" actually block the vents?<p><p>&#176;	Is every puff partially or completely blocked?<p><p>&#176;	Are some puffs blocked and others not?<p><p>	As illustrated by Table1 above, the published studies present thebehavior of a very small number of smokers; in some cases, only one filter persmoker was evaluated.  Without a larger sample size, it is impossible tocharacterize the findings as representative of the "normal" smoking behavior ofthe individuals who participated in these studies, much less representative ofsmokers in general.  <p>	*     *     *<p>	In sum, FDA's assertion, based on one unpublished report, "that 32 to69% of low-tar cigarette smokers""fn1098"  [619 blockthe ventilation holes of their cigarettes (a)does not fairly reflect oreven take into account the published literature; (b)is unlikely to becorrect given the subsequent work by Kozlowski and others on the subject, and(c)is much higher than the actual incidence, as found in other studies.FDA's sole reliance on the 1980 Kozlowski article is scientifically unsound,arbitrary and capricious. <p>	Although there is some anecdotal evidence that vent blocking occurs on alimited basis, there is ]no empirical evidence or scientific basisfor conclusions regarding the incidence in the smoking population as a whole.FDA cannot refute the basic fact recognized by the Surgeon General and others:filter ventilation is highly effective in reducing the yields of "tar" andnicotine in low "tar" cigarettes.<h4>c.	  Conclusion</h4><b>	</b>	To date, the scientific literature on compensation is limited andinconclusive.  The evidence shows that, to the extent compensation occurs atall, it is a limited and short-termphenomenon among a small group of smokers.  Whatever conclusions may ultimatelybe reached about compensation, the fact remains that during the past 40 yearsthere has been a proliferation of brands and styles at every point along the"tar" and nicotine spectrum as measured by the FTC method.  Many smokers havechosen to switch to lower yield cigarettes, and over the years, the averageyield of cigarettes generally has declined markedly."fn1098"  [620]<h2>L.	FDA's CLAIM THAT THE SALES-WEIGHTEDFTC</h2><b>	NICOTINE YIELDS HAVE INCREASED SINCE</b><p>	<b>1982 INDEPENDENTLY OF "TAR" IS MISLEADING</b><p><p>	As a result of the introduction and increased popularity of lowand ultra-lowbrands, the sales-weightednicotine yields, as reported by the FTC, have decreased substantially over thepast 40 years.  Nevertheless, FDA claims that "there is an apparent increase inthe sales-weighted FTC nicotine delivery ratings, for all cigarettes, since1982," and that "nicotine yields had the greatest increase in the ultra low-targroup.""fn1101"  [621  FDA characterizes theseassertions as "very important," because, according to the Agency, they provideevidence that cigarette manufacturers independently manipulate nicotine.622 <p>	FDA's analysis is flawed, and the Agency's conclusions are invalid, inaccurateand misleading.  Moreover, in attempting to cobble together its argument, FDAignores the long history of "tar" and nicotine reductions by the U.S. cigarettemanufacturers.  The fact is that from 1950 to the present, U.S. cigarettemanufacturers have reduced "tar" and nicotine yields by more than60percent.<p>	Further, the Agency has refused to provide the most important data it reliedupon and a meaningful explanation of how those data were derived and analyzed,including the cigarette sales figures.  On August31, 1995, and again onDecember 8, 1995, we specifically requested that FDA place in the record thisinformation.623  FDA has refused to provide these materials.624  As a result,we, and other members of the public, have been denied a fair opportunity toreview and comment upon the data, and the Agency's claims on this issue cannotbe considered by the Agency in this rulemaking.625]<h3>1.		FDA's Use of 1982 as Its Reference Year		Distorts Actual Trends in "Tar"and Nicotine</h3><b>Yields.                                     </b><p><p>	Remarkably, FDA criticizes cigarette manufacturers withoutrecognizing the significant reductions in "tar" and nicotine yields over thepast 40 years.  By contrast, the U.S. Surgeon General reported in 1981 that<p>"the yield of `tar' declined from 38mg in 1954 to 19mg in 1975,while that of nicotine declined from 2.3mg to 1.3mg per cigarette.The decline in both `tar' and nicotine approximated 50% over this 20-yearperiod....""fn1109"  [626  <p><p>As recently as late 1994 --after the Agency first disclosed its "tar" and nicotine increase theory --Drs. Ernst Wynder and Dietrich Hoffmann reported that "[s]ince 1955, the UnitedStates sales-weighted average smoke yields have declined from 38mg tarand 2.7mg nicotine/cigarette to 13.5 and 1.0mg, respectively."627<p>	FDA's deliberate choice of 1982 --a year when nicotine yields were unusually low --as its "reference" year distorts this long-term trend of decliningsales-weighted average "tar" and nicotine yields.628  Figure1 depicts thereduction in the sales-weighted average "tar" and nicotine yields from 1956through 1994.629  Clearly, sales-weighted "tar" and nicotine yields aresignificantly lower than in the past.  FDA's skewed snapshot would bemisleading -- even if the Agency's analysis passed muster.  As shown below,however, FDA's analysis does not pass muster.]<h3>2.		The FDA Uses Inaccurately Calculated</h3>		<b>Sales-Weighted Average Smoke Yields.</b><p><p>		Accurate calculations of sales-weighted average yields must be done on abrand-by-brand basis; that is, each cigarette brand must be matched with thesmoke yields and the market share or sales data associated with it for eachyear.  This approach was outlined as early as 1981 by the Surgeon General:"The sales-weighted average is derived from the "tar" or nicotine yield ofeach cigarette available in the United States, weighted by the numbersof packages of each brand sold annually.""fn1115"  [630<p>	FDA has inexplicably, and without scientific justification, failed to followthis simple, straightforward approach.631  FDA apparently made calculations forall brands combined and for various "tar" categories using ]categorymarket share data, i.e., the total market share (or volume) forall brands within a category, rather than the market share or sales data foreach brand."fn1116"  [632  This technique isinappropriate because it gives equal weight to all brands in a category.Brands with little or no market share are given the same weight as those brandsthat are major sellers; thus the so-called sales-weighted "tar" and nicotinevalues produced by FDA are ]not true "sales-weighted" averages ofthe cigarette market or the three "tar" categories shown by FDA in its graphs.<h3>3.		Changes in the Sales-WeightedYields of Individual</h3><b>		Categories Are the Result of Brand Shifting and</b><p><b>		Changes in Category Sales -- Not NicotineManipulation.</b><p><p>	FDA's analysis also fails to account for the fact that brands of cigarettesshift from one category to another --and, in doing so, may have a significant effect on the sales-weightedaverage of the category's nicotine yields.  Indeed, depending on the marketshares involved, the shifting between categories of different cigarette brandscan increase (or decrease) the sales-weighted averages of eachcategory.<p>	For example, when a brand at the lower-end of the high-"tar"category (which therefore made that category's sales-weighted average somewhatlower) decreases its yields and, therefore, moves into the higher-endof the low-"tar"category, the sales-weightedaverage of the low-"tar" category thereby increases.  At the same time, theaverage of the high-"tar"category (which no longer has that brand) increases as well, because only theother higher yield brands remain.  Thus, apparent increases inboth categories result entirely from a decrease in the actualyield of the shifting brand."fn1116"  [633<p>	The reason that the sales-weighted average "tar" and nicotine yields of theultra-low "tar" category have increased during this period is simple:  Moresuccessful brand styles are at the higher end of the "tar" range for thecategory, and the entry of these new brands accounts for a much higherpercentage of the category sales.<p>	The ultra-low "tar" category is unique because the distribution of brandstyles in that category has undergone dramatic changes since the late 1970s andearly 1980s.  For example, the FTC Report for brands manufactured in 1979listed 22 cigarette brand styles with less than 6mg "tar."  Only 9 ofthose brands had "tar" yields greater than 3mg, and those 9 accounted for50percent of category sales.  By 1982, the category included 51 brands.26brands in the category, representing 60percent of category sales,had "tar" levels greater than 3mg.  In 1989, 52ultra-low "tar"brands were included in the FTC Report, but 34 brands with FTC "tar" yieldsgreater than 3 mg accounted for almost 73percent of sales.  This changealone would account for the upward trend observed.<p>	The reported increase in the sales-weighted "tar" and nicotine yields of theultra-low "tar" category since 1982 thus is the result of changes in brandavailability and sales --not, as FDA contends, because of methods used to "maintain adequate nicotinedelivery from low-yield products."634  Further, the traditional classificationof cigarettes into categories by "tar" yields is vulnerable to shifts of brandstyles at the endpoints.  A major brand could shift from one category toanother, simply by a difference of 0.1 mg/cigarette, such as 15.5 mg to15.4mg, and have a significant impact on the sales-weighted average ofthe two categories involved.635  FDA has<p> failed to take these factors into account.]<h3>4.		There Are Other Flaws and Inconsistencies </h3>		<b>in the FDA's Analysis.                   </b><p><p>	Quite apart from the flaws in the methodology discussed above,FDA's misuse of the FTC's yield figures has apparently been compounded by othererrors, as well as by a misleading presentation of the data."fn1117"  [636]<h4>a.		FDA Relies on Data That Are Not Supported</h4>			<b>by FTC Reports.                          </b><p><p>	FDA identifies sales-weightedaverage smoke yields for all years from 1982 to 1991, and claims thatthe source for the numbers is the FTC."fn1119"  [637But the FTC's reports do not contain data that support all of the informationpresented by FDA.  A survey of the FTC reports raises serious questions aboutthe validity of FDA's claims and, again, demonstrates the vice in FDA's refusalto disclose the true source(s) of its data.<p>	FDA claims that ]sales-weightedaverage nicotine yields have increased since 1982.  To calculate a truesales-weightedaverage, however, smoke yield data must be matched with sales data for the yearin which the cigarettes were produced and sampled from the market.Table2 shows the dates when cigarettes were sampled from the market byFTC contractors, and the dates on which the FTC issued its report for thosecigarettes."fn1119"  [638  As the table shows, theFTC purchased market samples two different times during 1982, ]but didnot actually issue a report in calendar year 1982.  Reports containing thedata for the two 1982 samples were issued in 1983 and 1984.  It is not knownwhat FTC cigarette sample FDA attributed to calendar year 1982.  Similarly,the FTC did not sample the market in 1984 or 1985, and no FTC report was issuedfor cigarettes manufactured in 1986.  Yet, FDA shows sales-weighted averagesfor all of those years.<p>	The Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory ("TITL") historically has purchasedand tested cigarette market samples at the same time as the FTC.  TITL hasdocumented these samples by assigning a market sample number to each.According to TITL's records and market sample numbers, no cigarettes weresampled or tested in 1984 or 1985."fn1119"  [639FDA's source of data for 1984 and 1985 is thus unknown and suspect, especiallyin light of the "peaks" in 1985 data shown in the FDA graphs.  Clearly, FDA'srefusal to disclose this information makes it impossible to provide fullcomment on these data; and, therefore, the Agency may not rely on these data inthis rulemaking.]<h4>b.		FDA's Numbers of Observations Do Not</h4>			<b>Match Those in the FTCReports.</b><p><p>	Table 2 also shows the number of brands reported by the FTC ineach of its reports.  The column to the right of those numbers shows the numberof observations (brands) used by FDA in its calculation of sales-weightedaverages."fn1120"  [640  FDA apparently used fewerbrands for its 1990 and 1991 calculations than the FTC included in its reportsfor brands manufactured in those years.  Further, FDA acknowledges (but doesnot explain why) it deleted some brands in its calculations.641  For otheryears, it is apparent that FDA used ]more brands in its calculationsthan were reported by the FTC.  For example, the FTC report for 1988 brands,issued in 1990, includes data for 370 brands.  FDA indicates that 392 brandswere used for its 1988 calculations.  Again, FDA's source(s) and methodologyare suspect --and in any event, unknown.<h4>c.		FDA Sales Data Do Not Match Those of</h4>			<b>Maxwell and OtherSources.</b><p><p>	In addition, there are discrepancies between the sales figures(in billions of units) listed in FDA's "raw data" and those reported by theMaxwell Report, which are close approximations of those used by the tobaccoindustry.  For example, FDA shows total sales of 602.8 billion units for 1982;the 1982 Maxwell Report shows 1982 volume of 624.1 billion units."fn1121"  [642  Similar discrepancies exist between FDAand Maxwell volume data for 1983, 1984, and 1985.  Again, the Agency's refusalto disclose the sales data for the individual brands it used to calculate its"sales weighted" statistics precludes any reliance --by FDA or anyone else --on its "analysis."]<h4>d.		Normal Analytical Variation Exceeds</h4>			<b>Differences Cited byFDA.</b><p><p>	Finally, even if FDA's numbers were correct-- something weclearly dispute-- the very small "increase" in nicotine yields which theAgency believes it has detected over a nine-year period are actually soinsignificant that they could well be explained by simple analyticalvariations.<p>	For example, Table3 shows the results of a recent interlaboratory trialby TITL and the six major U.S. cigarette manufacturers."fn1124"  [643  TITL purchases and distributes to eachlaboratory cigarettes from various locations around the country.  Eachlaboratory tests each cigarette on four smoking ports, five cigarettes perport, every day over a 5-day period (100 cigarettes per sample total).  AsTable3 shows, the "differences" between the high and low sales-weightedaverage nicotine yields between 1982 and 1991, as reported by FDA, fall withinthe range of differences shown among laboratories testing different packages ofthe same cigarettes.644]<h4>e.		Conclusion</h4><p>	As shown above, many factors cast serious doubt on the reliability of FDA'sclaims regarding the sales-weighted average nicotine yields.  First,FDA's disregard of the contributions of individual cigarette brands incomputing sales-weightedaverages is a fatal flaw.  Second, there are other doubts as to FDA'sdata sources, including the sources of data for years in which no FTC sampleswere collected and other years for which no FTC report was issued, anddiscrepancies in sales data when FDA's figures are compared to those ofrecognized published sources. <p>	FDA's choice of the unusual year of 1982 as its base year ignores thelong-term decline in sales-weighted average "tar" and nicotine, and distortsthe more recent trends of those averages.  FDA also ignores the changes in thebrands and sales within the ultra-low "tar" category that account for theshifts in sales-weighted averages in that category. <p>	In sum, FDA can not escape the undisputed fact that the sales-weighted average"tar" and nicotine yields in cigarette smoke have decreased dramatically overthe last 40 years.  The U.S. Surgeon General and other independent researcherssuch as Drs. Ernst Wynder and Dietrich Hoffmann have confirmed that simplefact.  FDA has used incorrectly calculated data to exaggerate shifts insales-weighted average yields of "tar" and nicotine and to portray the flawedresults as evidence of "independent manipulation of nicotine."  Even apart fromFDA's refusal to permit the public to test its "analysis" by providing thenecessary data and a full description of its methodology --a posture unbecoming for any agency supposedly committed to the scientificprocess --FDA's flawed approach cannot serve as a basis for such conclusions.<p><H3><a href=vol4.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

INTRODUCTION</h2><tt>	As we have discussed in Volumes I and II of these comments, FDA has nojurisdiction over cigarettes marketed without therapeutic claims; and none ofthe manufacturers of cigarettes currently on the market makes any such claimsfor its products.  FDA's "findings," therefore, are legally irrelevant to theissue of whether the Agency has authority to regulate cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	Nevertheless, to provide a full record and to address the many inaccurateand misleading statements made by FDA, we comment on FDA's principal"scientific" arguments in "Nicotine In Cigarettes And Smokeless TobaccoProducts Is A Drug And These Products Are Nicotine Delivery Devices Under theFederal Food, Drug, And Cosmetic Act," 60Fed.Reg. 41,545-41,787(the "Jurisdictional Analysis").</tt> [1<p>	In this volume of our comments, we address FDA's claim that various aspects oftobacco growing, tobacco leaf purchasing, tobacco leaf blending, and cigarettedesign and manufacture support the Agency's attempt to regulate cigarettes.  Wewill demonstrate that FDA has made numerous assertions of "fact" which areeither unsupported or based on a mischaracterization of the scientificliterature or industry documents and practices.  A careful review of theAgency's "scientific" section of its Jurisdictional Analysis reveals that, evenapart from its legal invalidity, any assertion of jurisdiction based on these"findings" would be arbitrary and capricious.]<p><tt></tt><h2>N.

Introduction</h3><tt></tt><p><tt>	For many decades, the United States Department ofAgriculture ("USDA") has been intimately involved in all aspects of tobaccoagriculture.  During this same period, FDA has had no such involvementin tobacco agriculture.  It is, therefore, not surprising that FDA's review oftobacco agricultural practices in its "Jurisdictional Analysis" reflects bothignorance and naivete.  What is surprising -- and disturbing -- is that theAgency undertook such a limited review before making its totally unsupportedallegations that the cigarette manufacturers are "manipulating" the nicotinecontent of raw tobacco through some sort of arrangement with tens of thousandsof independent farmers.  The results of FDA's "analysis" and the Agency's"conclusions" are wrong and misleading. </tt><p><tt>	For example, FDA claims that the average nicotine content for "the mostwidely grown" American flue-cured tobaccos increased from 1.93% in 1955 to3.07% in 1980.</tt> [2  Even if one ignores theother deficiencies in the Agency's analysis and assertions, the fact is thatpublicly available information discussed below demonstrates that FDA is simplywrong.  To take just one example, the variety of flue-cured tobacco that wasmost widely grown in North Carolina in 1989,3 when cultivated in accordancewith the widely used agronomic practices (]<tt>e.g., plantdisease control, fertilization, weed control, topping, sucker control, andcuring) recommended by the State's Agriculture Extension-ResearchService ("State Extension-ResearchService")-- many of which FDA contends are designed to increase thenicotine content of the leaf --had an average nicotine content of 1.96%, which is virtuallyindistinguishable from FDA's 1955 number.  </tt><p><tt>	In fact, when all varieties tested in the crop performance are considered,the average nicotine level was 2.60% in 1954 and 2.58% in 1994.</tt>[4  Furthermore, the average nicotine content offlue-cured leaf grown in accordance with State Extension-ResearchService recommendations has ]<tt>decreased during the last 16 years.This decrease is correlated with increased farm yields (i.e.,more pounds of tobacco per acre) resulting from USDA and StateExtension-Research Service recommendations of improved agronomic practices andhigher yielding tobacco varieties.</tt><p><tt>	FDA is also wrong when it claims that cigarette manufacturers so controltobacco agriculture as to "manipulate nicotine independently of other tobaccocomponents to ensure that cigarettes contain sufficient nicotine to satisfysmokers."</tt> [5  The facts, which FDA eitherhas failed to develop or has ignored completely, refute this allegation.  <p>	Tobacco is an agricultural product.  It is grown from seeds developed byprivate and public breeders, including the USDA and State university research-extensionservices.  Tobacco is grown on thousands of farms throughout the United States,by thousands of farmers.  The type of tobacco (flue-cured, burley, etc.) grownin a particular area within the United States is specified by governmentregulations.  Soil characteristics, weather conditions, agronomic practices(such as those recommended by USDA and the State Extension-ResearchServices) and many other factors affect crop yield, appearance (color andtexture), taste characteristics and chemical characteristics (including thenicotine content of the leaf).  ]The cigarette manufacturers are purchasers, not growers, oftobacco in the United States.  Cigarette manufacturers do not control theprivate and public breeders who develop tobacco varieties for cultivation.  Themanufacturers do not control the thousands of individual farmers who select thevarieties of tobacco to be planted and the agronomic practices to be used.  Themanufacturers do not control the climatic, soil and other conditions underwhich tobacco is grown.</tt> [6  Finally, andmost assuredly, the manufacturers do not control the USDA or the various StateExtension-ResearchServices.  FDA offers no support at all for its assertion that cigarettemanufacturers can control the supply of tobacco (or its chemistry) availablefor purchase at auction.]<h3>2.		American-GrownTobaccos Have Not Undergone</h3><tt><b>		Cumulative Increases in Nicotine Content</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Since the 1950s                           </b></tt><p><tt></tt><h4>a.		The Authority Cited by FDA Does Not Support</h4><tt><b>			the Agency's Contention That American Grown</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Tobaccos Have Undergone Cumulative Increases</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>in Nicotine Content Since the 1950s         </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Ignoring the information available to it, FDA claims that"American tobaccos of all types have undergone cumulative increases in totalnicotine levels since the 1950's."</tt> [7  Insupport of this sweeping conclusion, the Agency relies on a]<tt>single article written by DeJong, a USDA employee, andpublished a decade ago.</tt> [8  <p>	FDA's misuse of this article is remarkable.  Quotations are incomplete and outof context; only information that advances FDA's agenda is presented, whileinconsistent or contradictory information is ignored; and the central thesesadvanced by the author, which flatly contradict the FDA's position, are omittedaltogether.9  <p>	Although DeJong's data suggest an increase (due to certain agronomicpractices) in nicotine levels in American tobaccos from 1955 to 1980, it is histhesis that this increase caused a ]<tt>decline in demand by themanufacturers for American-grown leaf, and an increase in demand for lowernicotine, foreign-grown leaf.  In other words, DeJong believed thatAmerican cigarette manufacturers were using greater quantities of foreign-grownleaf because it was lower in nicotine.10  DeJong also stated that thevery high nicotine content of American-grown tobaccos produced in dry growingseasons resulted in wholesale rejection of crops by the manufacturers.The DeJong article, therefore, flatly contradicts FDA's central claimthat a goal of American cigarette manufacturers is to increase the nicotinecontent of tobaccos available for use in cigarette manufacturing.</tt><p><tt>	FDA also cites DeJong for the proposition that the nicotine levels in "themost widely grown" American tobaccos increased almost 10% for burley (from2.91% to 3.18%) and more than 50% for flue-cured (from 1.93% to 3.07%) between1955 and 1980.</tt> [11  DeJong, however, doesnot indicate, as FDA implies, that his data relate to "the most widely grownAmerican tobaccos"-- nor does the source of DeJong's 1955 data, anarticle by Harlan and Moseley.12  In fact, in their article, Harlan and Moseleydescribed their 1955 data only as "Representative Analyses of CigaretteTobaccos."  The authors emphasize the large variations that occur among types,farms, and years.  <p>	Moreover, Harlan and Moseley's 1955 nicotine data are different from otherpublished data that were readily available to FDA.  Data published by NorthCarolina State University show that the average nicotine content for flue-curedtobacco grown in North Carolina under documented conditions and using Extension-ResearchServices-recommended agronomic practices was 2.46% in 1955,13 which isconsiderably higher than (but within one standard deviation of) Harlan andMoseley's reported value of 1.93%. <p>	DeJong's 1980 data were derived from a "collaborative project" to survey thechemical composition of tobaccos grown in different parts of the world.14Neither Harlan and Moseley nor DeJong provide information concerning thesampling methods, the source of the samples, how many samples were tested, thepercentage of the crop represented by each sample or any of the otherinformation necessary to determine what their numbers represent.  NeitherHarlan and Moseley nor DeJong state that the values they report represent "themost widely grown American tobaccos."  That assertion is made only by FDA -- anagency without any expertise in this area (and without any support for thatassertion).<p>	There is another fundamental flaw in FDA's analysis.  FDA compared data fromonly two years, 1955 and 1980.  This choice might be defensible if data fromthese years were the only available data, and if there were no reason to doubtthat these data were representative of other years.  Here, however, neither ofthose propositions is true.  ]<p><tt>	First, there is a large body of data available to FDA in thepublished literature.  Those data show wide variances in nicotine content formany years.  For example, a 1914 textbook reports nicotine content in "a verycommon tobacco" as high as 8%.</tt> [15Valleau reported in 1949 nicotine levels in burley tobacco as high as 4.5%.16Heggestead and Bowman (1953) reported nicotine levels for burley tobacco in1948 and 1950 in the range of 5%.17  In 1958 USDA reported average nicotinelevels above 4% for representative grades of the 1951 and 1952 crops ofburley.18  In addition, there is a vast amount of data concerning flue-curedtobacco available for the period 1954-1994, which FDA apparently did not evenbother to compile -- much less analyze.  We analyze those data below.  <p>	FDA's reliance on the DeJong data, together with the Agency's total failure toacknowledge contrary data from equally or more authoritative sources, reflectsa general strategy of selective and biased citation from the scientificliterature, which FDA has used throughout its "Jurisdictional Analysis."  Ourcomments demonstrate that, with respect to tobacco products, FDA's use of thescientific literature is untrustworthy. ]Second, FDA knows or should know that 1955 and 1980 were notrepresentative years in terms of the nicotine content of raw tobacco.  Indeed,FDA explicitly acknowledges elsewhere (though it misinterprets) the fact thatthe 1955 flue-curedcrop was unbalanced with a large proportion of low-nicotine "discount"varieties.</tt> [19  The year 1980 is likewisenot representative.  Since 1980, the average nicotine levels of flue-curedtobacco leaf cultivated in accordance with the practices recommended by theState Extension-ResearchServices have ]<tt>decreased to the point where, in 1994, nicotinelevels were approximately equal to the 1955 levels as reported byDeJong.</tt> [20  FDA's selection of 1955 and1980 as its points of comparison is biased, and a distortion of the universe ofrelevant data. ]<h4>b.

They are indefensible if one looks at the publicly availableinformation which FDA ignored when it issued its indictment of thousands ofpublic and private tobacco breeders, farmers and manufacturers.</tt><p><tt>	The North Carolina Official Variety Trials for flue-cured tobacco havebeen conducted annually since 1954 to provide information to growers and thetobacco industry on the performance of commercially available varieties offlue-cured tobacco.  Commercially available varieties are grown at fivedifferent test stations in North Carolina.  The agronomic practices used ingrowing the tobacco at the various locations are documented, as are theprevailing weather conditions and soil characteristics.</tt> [21  The resulting crop is evaluated for cropyield, quality, agronomic characteristics and disease resistance.  A number ofchemical characteristics, including nicotine content, are measured.  Thenicotine levels measured in these trials are representative of the levels thatwould be expected in a crop grown in accordance with State Extension-ResearchServices-recommended agronomic practices, under similar weather conditions.22The results of these trials have been published annually by North CarolinaState University since 1954 in a publication entitled "Measured CropPerformance."23<p>	We have summarized and tabulated the nicotine content data from the "MeasuredCrop Performance" reports.  We have also analyzed additional data from NorthCarolina State University on actual crop percentages for the period 1973 to1995.<p>	The nicotine level measurements reported in "Measured Crop Performance" wereentered into a database, sorted and analyzed.  A total of 3403 data points wereused in these calculations.  The following Tables and Figures were derived fromthe nicotine content data reported for the years 1954-1994.24<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table A presents the "raw" data, sorted by year andlocation.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Table B presents data, sorted by year and then by variety,on number of locations tested, average nicotine, minimum nicotine, and maximumnicotine, and the standard deviation for the nicotine levels of each varietytested, sorted by year.  </tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Table C presents the same data as Table B, but the dataare sorted by variety and then by year.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Table D shows, for each year, the total number oflocations tested, maximum nicotine level measured, minimum level measured, andaverage and standard deviation for all varieties combined.</tt><p><p><tt>Tables E through I constitute the best available estimates of thepercentage of the North Carolina crop represented by each of the varieties offlue-cured tobacco available to farmers in the years 1973, 1974 and 1979through 1994. </tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Table E shows the percentage of acreage for eachflue-cured variety planted in North Carolina for the years 1973-1974.</tt> [25 <p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table F shows the percentage of acreage for each flue-curedvariety planted in North Carolina for the years 1978-1979.</tt> [26 <p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table G provides crop percentage information for the years1979 through 1989.</tt> [27<p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table H presents information on the varieties of flue-curedtobacco that were actually grown by North Carolina farmers during the years1988 through 1990.  The table shows the results of a survey conducted byextension agents, based on seed sales within each county.</tt> [28 <p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table I contains the same information as Table H for the years1991 through 1995.</tt><p><p><tt>	The information contained in Tables A-D was combined with the informationin Tables E-I to calculate an estimate of the "weighted average" nicotinecontent of North Carolina-grown flue-cured leaf for the pertinent years.  Foreach year for which crop percentage for the varieties was available, theaverage nicotine content measured in the North Carolina Official Variety Trialsfor each variety was "weighted" by the percentage of the crop represented bythat variety.</tt> [29  Tables J-K show thecalculations and the results.<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Table J presents the calculation of the "weighted average"nicotine content for the North Carolina flue-cured crop for each year for whichcrop percentage data were available.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Table K shows the unweighted average and "weightedaverage" nicotine content of North Carolina-grown flue-cured tobacco from 1954to 1994, for all varieties combined, by year.</tt><p><p><tt>	Tables A, B and C demonstrate the predominant effect of weather, soilconditions, and agronomic practices on the nicotine content of tobacco leaf.Illustrative is K326, which was by far the most widely grown variety in thelast ten years.</tt> [30  Table C shows averagenicotine levels for K326, over all locations, ranging from a low of 1.96% in1989 to a high of 3.13% in 1983.  TableA shows that the minimum andmaximum nicotine levels measured at any one location for K326 between 1982 and1994 range from a low of 1.35% in Rocky Mount in 1991 to a high of 3.93% inOxford in 1983.  These wide fluctuations in the nicotine content of the samevariety of tobacco can be attributed only to factors other than plant genetics,such as weather, soil characteristics and agronomic practices (to the extentthat they varied among test locations).<p>	The data from Table K are charted in Figure 1, which shows the following:<p>	]&#176;<tt>	There was no significant change in nicotine levels from 1954to 1967, with the exception of 1956, when the nicotine levels droppedsignificantly,</tt> [31 and 1963, which wascomparatively high;<p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	There appears to be an increasing trend from 1967 to1977;</tt> [32 and<p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	There was then a sharp drop in 1978, followed by an apparentdecreasing trend to 1994,</tt> [33 with the1994 average being approximately equal to the 1954 level (2.58% vs. 2.60%,unweighted).<p><p>	As Figure 1 demonstrates, FDA's facile conclusion that cigarette manufacturershave acted to drive up the nicotine content of flue-cured leaf has no basis infact.  Indeed, the opposite conclusion would be reached if one were to focus onthe last 17 years.  <p>	Also noteworthy is the fact that the average nicotine level for the mostwidely grown variety of flue-cured tobacco for the last ten years, K326,34 hasbeen consistently ]<tt>lower than the unweighted average for allvarieties combined, although the difference is not statisticallysignificant.</tt> [35  If nicotine leveldictated which variety were to be grown, K326 would not have jumped from 22% ofthe market one year after its introduction in 1983, to more than 50% in 1989,and more than 60% in 1993.36  ]<h4>c.		There Is No Significant Trend in the</h4><tt><b>			Nicotine Content of Burley Tobacco</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Varieties                           </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Comparable data for burley tobacco varieties are notavailable because of the differences in the testing programs for the twotobacco types.  The majority of available burley nicotine values are found inthe documents related to the release of new varieties through the MinimumStandards Program ("MSP").  The MSPs for flue-curedand burley tobacco establish guidelines to ensure that new varieties are ofacceptable quality.  The burley variety testing program has emphasized yieldand agronomic characteristics; nicotine content has not been measured exceptfor "check" varieties and for new varieties in the year they werereleased.</tt> [37  The nicotine values areavailable from the on-farm tests for two check varieties from 1981 through 1994and for each new variety in the year it was released.38  <p>	Results of the on-farm tests where nicotine levels were measured are presentedin Table L and Figure 2.  An examination of these data do not indicate anysignificant trends in the nicotine content since 1981.  As with flue-curedtobacco, there are annual fluctuations due to growing conditions:  The levelsof nicotine in burley leaf are influenced by the same factors that areimportant for flue-cured tobacco, ]<tt>e.g., weather, soilcharacteristics and agronomic practices.  </tt><p><tt>	*          *          *</tt><p><tt>	In sum, the data do not support FDA's contention that the nicotine contentof American-grown tobaccos has increased significantly since 1955.  Nor do theyfurnish a basis for FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes.  </tt><p><tt>	Another branch of the federal government, the USDA, has been directlyinvolved in tobacco agriculture for more than forty years.  It has theexpertise in this area, which FDA lacks, and it has data in this area, whichFDA ignored.  Those data show a decreasing, not an increasing, trend inthe nicotine content of American-grown tobacco over the last 17 years. </tt><h3>3.

It evolved out of a cooperative program among breeders, tobaccocompanies, State Extension-ResearchServices in tobacco-producingstates, and the USDA.  The burley tobacco MSP was established in 1977.  It wasdeveloped by the "Burley Tobacco Quality Committee-- Varieties."Membership on this committee included tobacco companies, breeders (both publicand private), State Extension-ResearchServices agronomists (from Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee),two seed improvement associations, and others.  The purpose of the program was"to develop a uniform testing, evaluation and recommendation program involvingboth public and privately developed advanced breeding lines of burleytobacco."40<p>	By minimizing the role of the USDA, tobacco breeders, and State Extension-ResearchServices, FDA mischaracterizes the tobacco industry's41 participation in theseprograms as "controlling."42  By ignoring all other benchmarks foracceptability of new tobacco varieties and by misinterpreting the nicotinestandards applied in the MSPs, FDA invalidly and, in fact, incorrectly claimsthat the MSPs were designed to ensure that nicotine levels of U.S.-grown andmarketed tobacco do not fall below specified ranges.43  Finally, inself-contradictory fashion, FDA ]<tt>ignores the necessary effect ofthe nicotine standards applied in the MSPs when it claims that tobacco productmanufacturers have acted to develop and introduce high-nicotine varieties oftobacco for cultivation in the United States.</tt><p><tt>	Once again, FDA is demonstrably wrong on the facts.  As discussed below,the MSPs were not and are not controlled by the cigarettemanufacturers, and the purpose of the MSPs was not and is not tocontrol nicotine levels.  Furthermore, the MSPs do not maintain constant and"specified" nicotine levels.  Indeed, the MSPs have prevented andcontinue to prevent the introduction of high-nicotine varieties oftobacco for cultivation in the United States.</tt><p><tt>	The MSPs were developed in cooperation with, and are conducted with theactive participation of, the USDA.</tt> [44This fact alone belies FDA's contention that the manufacturers control theMSPs.  In addition, representatives of cigarette manufacturers comprise only aminority of the membership of the committees that set the rules and administerthe programs.<p>	The committee that administers the burley tobacco MSP has the following votingmembership:45<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Cigarette manufacturers:  1 vote each;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Leaf dealers:  1 vote each;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Tobacco Association of the UnitedStates:1vote;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Breeders and state coordinators:</tt> [46  1 vote each;<p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Extension agronomists from Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennesseeand Virginia:  1 vote each;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Kentucky Seed Improvement Association:  1 vote; and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Tennessee Crop Improvement Association:  1 vote. </tt><p><p><tt>	The Flue-Cured Tobacco Variety Evaluation Committee similarly had 25members in 1994.</tt> [47  Only five wererepresentatives of cigarette manufacturers, and two were leaf dealers (who buyfor the cigarette manufacturers).  The remaining 18 voting members representland-grant universities, public agencies, private and public seed growers, andother associations.48  Simple arithmetic demonstrates that the cigarettemanufacturers cannot "control" these programs.]<h4>b.		The Purpose of the MSPs Is To Increase and</h4><tt><b>			Maintain Quality of Tobacco and To Develop </b></tt><p><tt><b>			Varieties That Are Disease-Resistant and</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Have Higher Crop Yields</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA claims that "[o]ne key objective of the tobacco industry's involvementin the Minimum Standards Program appears to be to ensure that nicotine levelsin marketed tobacco do not fall below specified levels."</tt> [49  That conclusion is based on two falsepremises:  (1)that the flue-curedMSP was adopted in the 1950s in response to the emergence of low-nicotine"discount" varieties of tobacco50 "that failed to meet current industryspecifications established, among other things, to control the amount ofnicotine delivery when used in manufacturing filtered cigarettes,"51 and (2)that the key objective of the MSPs is to maintain nicotine levels.  Both theAgency's premises and its conclusion are wrong.<p>	FDA's assertion that the tobacco industry sought the elimination of "discount"varieties from the USDA price support program ]<tt>because of their lownicotine content is historically inaccurate.</tt> [52  The real history, as explained by the USDA,is quite different.<p>	A 1961 USDA publication53 explains that the so-called "discount" varietieswere originally developed ]<tt>in response to the cigarettemanufacturers' demand for milder, lower nicotine tobaccos:</tt><p><tt>"Several dry years in succession, combined with changes in agriculturalconditions, resulted in stronger, higher nicotine tobaccos produced and broughta demand from industry for milder tobaccos.  Three varieties, Coker 139, Coker140 and Dixie Bright 244, were produced by tobacco breeders and were expectedat the time of their introduction to be the salvation of the industry.  Thesevarieties proved to be highly acceptable to the farmer because they weremilder, were lower in nicotine, possessed acceptable disease resistance, hadcuring qualities which resulted in relatively higher Federal Grades, and gavehigh yields compared with standard varieties."</tt> [54<p><p>	These varieties, however, proved to be undesirable due to othercharacteristics such as flavor and aroma, and were too popular with farmers,resulting in an imbalance in the varieties (grade selection) of leaf available.Consequently, USDA developed the price support discount program -- for flue-curedtobacco only -- by modifying the existing price support program:<p>"The 3 new varieties proved to be so popular with the farmers thatapproximately 70 percent of the 1956 crop was estimated to consist of them.However, the new varieties proved to be `low to lacking in flavor and aroma,generally of light body, and . . . [poorly accepted in] the trade.'  Inaddition, the disproportionate amount of these varieties led to an unbalance inthe various quality factors available to buyers.  They were also especiallyundesirable to the foreign consumers, and it soon became obvious that somethingmust be done to place the industry on a sounder basis.<p><p>"After extensive consultation with the various segments of the industry, theUnited States Department of Agriculture on December 18, 1956, announced plansto reduce the 1957 crop support rates for the varieties Coker 139, Coker 140,and Dixie Bright 244 to 50 percent of the support rates for comparable gradesof other acceptable flue-cured varieties.  The three varieties were thus madediscount varieties.  The Department also announced plans for enforcement of theprice-support discount program."55<p><p>	USDA's account of the history of the price-support discount program makes itclear that the discount varieties were undesirable due to qualities such aspoor flavor, low aroma, and light body.  When they proved to be so popular withthe farmers that they comprised over 70% of the crop, something had to be doneto bring balance and leaf selectivity (]<tt>i.e., grades) tothe market.  Consequently, USDA --not the cigarette manufacturers --implemented the flue-curedprice-support discount program.</tt> [56USDA's account thus contradicts FDA's superficial, result-oriented andincorrect characterization of the price-support discount program.<p>	FDA's contention that the purpose of the MSPs is "to ensure that nicotinelevels in marketed tobacco do not fall below specified levels" is also wrong.The purpose of the MSPs is to improve the quality of tobacco leaf, and todevelop and maintain varieties that are disease-resistant and produce highercrop yields.<p>	The current guidelines for both the flue-cured and the burley MSPs requirethat new varieties be compared to the "check" varieties for numerousattributes.  There is no basis for FDA to conclude that any one factor (such asnicotine level) is the driving force behind these programs.<p>	Under the flue-cured MSP guidelines, new varieties are comparedto thestandard "check"57 varieties for the following attributes:58<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Chemical characteristics</tt> [59<p>		Soluble sugars:  ]<tt>+ 15%</tt><p><tt>		Total nitrogen:  + 10%</tt><p><p><tt>		Nicotine:  +15%, -20%</tt> [60<p><p>		Secondary alkaloids:  not to exceed 13% of the total alkaloids <p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Physical Characteristics</tt><p><p><tt>		The entry must be equal to or better than the check variety with respectto color, body, texture, moisture, filling value and usability.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Flavor of Smoke</tt><p><p><tt>		Smoke evaluations by independent laboratories (rejection based on two ormore independent laboratories rating as unsatisfactory).</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Other Characteristics</tt><p><p><tt>		The entry is measured for disease resistance as a marker of geneticstability, and is rejected if found to be segregating.</tt> [61  Although not criteria for rejection,agronomic yield, economic value, plant height, leaf number and days to flowerare also evaluated for each entry.62<p><p>	Under the burley MSP, new varieties are compared to the "check" varieties63for the following attributes:64<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Physical Characteristics</tt><p><p><tt>		The entry must be equal to or better than the "check" variety withrespect to percent usable leaf and leaf quality scores, color, texture andbody.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Chemical Composition</tt><p><p><tt>		Nicotine +15%, -20%</tt> [65<p>		Total Nitrogen + or - 10%<p>		Secondary alkaloids - not more than 20% of total alkaloids<p><p>	]&#176;<tt>	Smoke Panel Evaluation</tt><p><p><tt>		Evaluated by test panels for flavor and aroma.  Rejection based on 50% ormore of panels rejecting.</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Other Characteristics</tt><p><p><tt>		Yield and disease resistance are evaluated,</tt> [66 as well as plant height, number of leaves perplant and number of days to flower.67  Entries must be genetically stable andare rejected if found to be segregating.68<p><p>	Contrary to FDA's allegation that the MSPs have been concerned only withnicotine levels, the MSPs have made significant advances toward improving cropyield, leaf quality, and disease resistance.  For example, Bowman,]<tt>et al., found an annual estimated yield increase of 49.5kg/ha, of which 68% was attributable to improved agronomic practices and 32%was attributable to genetic improvement.</tt> [69  These researchers also found a genetic gainin yield of 14 kg/ha annually, which approached significance at the 0.05probability level, for the period following the implementation of the MSPprogram.70  Using similar comparisons, they found a highly significantimprovement in the quality of the new varieties as well as the check variety.The authors conclude,<p>"[t]hese analyses confirm a significant genetic contribution to improved leafyields of new cultivars. . . .  Data from the current study show thatleaf quality of new cultivars entered in the NC OVT, whether measured bynicotine, reducing sugars, and total nitrogen content, or manufacturerswillingness to pay a higher price for the tobacco, has been maintained andprobably improved . . . ."71<p><p>	The MSPs also have been successful in the area of disease resistance.  As USDAhas stated, "The incorporation of disease resistance into flue-cured tobaccohas always been a primary breeding objective in the development ofvarieties."72 USDA, extension, and other publications attest to the importanceof, and advances in, development of disease-resistant varieties for both flue-curedand burley tobacco.  <p>	For example, in a 1961 publication, USDA stated that no effective controlmeasures for brown spot disease were known.73  By 1976, the same bulletinrecommended use of tolerant varieties as a control measure.74  One of thearticles cited by FDA provides a good summary of the achievements of thebreeding programs in developing disease-resistant varieties as of 1978:<p>"In the past, much breeding work in tobacco has been conducted to producedisease-resistant cultivars with increased yields and acceptable quality.  Muchhas been accomplished and cultivars are available that have resistance to blackshank, bacterial wilt, ]<tt>Fusarium wilt, wild fire, blue mold,root-knot nematodes, tobacco mosaic virus, black root-rot, weather fleck,powdery mildew, potato virus Y and brown root-rot; cultivars are also availablethat have tolerance to brown spot."</tt> [75<p><p>The success of the breeding programs in developing disease-resistant varietiesof tobacco can hardly be disputed.<p>	*          *          *<p>	In summary, the new varieties breeding programs and the MSPs have madesignificant progress toward maintaining quality, improving yield and developingdisease-resistant varieties.  The success of the programs in achieving theirstated objectives refutes FDA's claim that they were actually designed toachieve a different purpose.  ]<h3>4.		The MSPs Are Not Designed To Maintain</h3><tt>		<b>Nicotine Above a "Specified" Level</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Only by ignoring all the other attributes assessed by the MSPs can FDAclaim that these programs were designed "to ensure that nicotine levels inmarketed tobacco do not fall below specified levels."</tt> [76  Even if one focuses solely on nicotinelevels, it is clear that the MSPs do not have, and have not had, the effect ofmaintaining nicotine levels above a specified "absolute" value.  The reason issimple:  The MSPs do not compare the nicotine level of the new varieties to aspecified absolute value; the standard for comparison is the average nicotinelevel produced by the "check varieties" in the MSP tests.  The average nicotinelevel of the "check varieties" in the MSP tests will vary from year to year, asa result of weather conditions, soil conditions and agronomic practices.Consequently, the "passing" nicotine levels for the new varieties tested in theMSP will also vary from year to year.  Clearly, the MSPs do ]<tt>notensure that nicotine content in tobacco plants does not fall below specificlevels. </tt><p><tt>	FDA's authority for the proposition that the MSPs ensure that nicotinelevels do not fall below a specified value, a letter from E.A. Wersman [sic,"Wernsman"] of North Carolina State University, does not support FDA'sposition.</tt> [77  Dr. Wernsman states that"because cured leaf of new cultivars must possess a nicotine concentrationwithin the range of 80% to 115% of that for longstanding check cultivarsevaluated in the same tests, the genetic basis for nicotine synthesiscapabilities for burley and flue-cured tobaccos have remained constant for manyyears."78  Quite apart from the fact that Dr.Wernsman noted that thedeviation acceptable from the check varieties is limited on the high side(+15%) even more stringently than on the low side (-20%),he does not say that the absolute nicotine ]<tt>levels of actualcrops have remained constant or in any way have been controlled by the MSPs.Rather, he says only that "nicotine synthesis capabilities" have remainedconstant.  This statement simply means that the genetic potentials fornicotine levels of the tobacco have remained constant.  Thus, Dr. Wernsman atmost supports only the conclusion that comparative nicotine levelsbetween the check varieties and new varieties have remainedconstant (i.e., within the range of +15% and -20%, which isspecified in the MSP standards).</tt><p><tt>	The fallacy of FDA's contention that the MSPs maintain absolute nicotinelevels above a "specified" level is demonstrated by the data presented inTables A, B, C, D, and L.  As discussed above, nicotine levels oftobacco leaf fluctuate significantly as a result of weather, soil conditions,and agronomic practices; and the nicotine levels of the same variety oftobacco can vary from location to location and year to year by 100% ormore.</tt> [79  <p>	Furthermore, the MSPs compare the nicotine levels of new varieties, not to a"specified" absolute level, but rather to the level produced by the checkvarieties in the MSP tests.  Consequently, from year to year, the nicotine]<tt>levels of the new varieties approved in the MSPs can varysignificantly.  For example, the Flue-Cured Tobacco MSP Committee Report for1977 states that the average nicotine level of the two check varieties in thesmall-plot tests was 3.98%,</tt> [80 and the1989 report shows that average nicotine content of the two check varieties inthe small-plot tests was 2.71%.81  Applying the flue-cured MSP criteria:<p>	-	in 1977 a new variety with a measured average nicotine level as high as4.58% (115% of the average of the two check varieties) would have "passed" (onthe high side) the nicotine standard in the small-plot tests, and a new varietywith a nicotine level below 3.18% (80% of the average of the two checkvarieties) would have failed on the low side;82<p><p>	-	in 1989, on the other hand, a new variety with a measured average nicotinelevel as low as 2.17% would have "passed" on the low side and a new varietywith a nicotine level higher than 3.12% would have failed on the high side.83<p><p>	It is obvious, therefore, that the MSPs are not used to "ensure that nicotinelevels in marketed tobacco do not fall below specified levels."  Plainly,]<tt>there are no specified levels. </tt><h3>5.		The MSPs Prevent the Introduction of </h3><tt><b>		High-Nicotine Varieties of Tobacco</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>for Cultivation in the United States</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's position that the MSPs were designed to maintain nicotinelevels is inconsistent with the Agency's claim that the industry abandonedinterest in the development of low-"tar"/low nicotine varieties and insteadturned to the development of higher nicotine varieties.</tt> [84  Without acknowledging the inconsistency, FDApurports to draw "support" for its claim that the cigarette manufacturers havedeveloped higher nicotine varieties from statements taken out of context and byincorrectly attributing to the cigarette manufacturers statements andactivities by others (including agents of the United States government).  <p>	FDA quotes an "expert in the field" as having stated in 1978 that "it may bedesirable to develop levels constant or develop lines higher in nicotine sothat when the tar and nicotine are reduced, there will still be enough nicotineleft to satisfy the smoker."85  The "expert in the field" was Dr. Chaplin, thenan employee of the USDA.86  Dr. Chaplin's suggestion was consistent with thoseof others (such as Dr. M. A. H. Russell) who recommended the development of low-"tar,"medium-nicotinecigarettes.87  <p>	Indeed, USDA followed up on this suggestion and conducted breeding research todevelop higher nicotine varieties of tobacco.88  USDA's research, however,never produced any commercial varieties of tobacco, and it was discontinuedafter Dr. Chaplin retired.89  Dr.Chaplin himself explained all of this toFDA personnel.  <p>	In a remarkable slight of hand, FDA also states that "the industry haselsewhere acknowledged that the role of American tobacco is to provide highlevels of nicotine in the finished product to offset the diluting effect ofbland foreign tobaccos and reconstituted tobacco sheet."90  In fact, thisso-called acknowledgment was not made by "the industry" -- as claimed byFDA-- but by DeJong, an employee of the USDA.  Moreover, DeJong expresslynoted that American cigarette manufacturers were using greater quantities offoreign-grown leaf ]<tt>because they were lower in nicotine -- aconclusion that directly contradicts FDA's theory.</tt> [91 <p>	FDA's supposition that "the industry" has acted to develop higher nicotinevarieties of tobacco for cultivation in the United States is simply false.Indeed, in 1953 and 1954 company representatives informed the University ofKentucky that the nicotine content in burley tobaccos had reached undesirablyhigh levels.92  <p>	Finally, as FDA acknowledges, the MSPs allow the average nicotine content ofnew varieties of tobacco to deviate upward from the average nicotine content ofthe check varieties by only 15% -- new varieties that produce a higher averagenicotine level are ]<tt>rejected.93  As long as the MSPs are ineffect, therefore, no significant genetically induced increase in the nicotinecontent of tobacco varieties available for cultivation in the United Statescould possibly take place.  Dr. Wernsman explained it well:  </tt><p><tt>"Because cured leaf of new leaf cultivars must possess a nicotineconcentration within the range of 80% to 115% of that for long standing checkcultivars evaluated in the same tests, the genetic basis for nicotine synthesiscapabilities for burley and flue-cured cultivars have remained constant formany years."</tt> [94  <p><p>	As discussed above, the empirical evidence concerning new varieties oftobaccos introduced since 1954 demonstrates that the breeding programs have]<tt>not resulted in the introduction of higher nicotine varietiesof tobacco, and that variations in the nicotine yield of the varieties grown inthe United States have been the result of weather and agronomicpractices.</tt> [95<p>	*          *          *<p>	In sum, the cigarette manufacturers do not control tobacco breeding programs;the breedings program and the MSPs are designed to improve leaf quality, cropyield and disease resistance.  Numerous varieties and germplasm lines have beenregistered by USDA and State Extension-ResearchServices researchers.  Those include KY14, one of the chief varieties forburley, and genotypes with improved yield potential and disease resistance.96FDA's claim that the cigarette manufacturers have controlled the breeding ofnew tobacco varieties to increase the nicotine level of American-grown tobaccoleaf thus is without any factual or other evidentiary basis.  Indeed, theAgency's claim is contrary to the facts.  The very MSPs which FDA allegesmaintain high levels of nicotine or increase these levels effectively]<tt>prevent the introduction of high-nicotine varieties of tobaccofor cultivation in the United States.  As demonstrated above, the averagenicotine content of American-grown, flue-cured tobaccos has decreased, notincreased, over the last 17 years.</tt><h3>6.		The Cigarette Manufacturers Do Not Control </h3><tt>		<b>Agronomic Practices To Increase Nicotine Levels</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's ignorance of American tobacco farming is reflected in its contentionthat cigarette manufacturers control the agronomic practices used by tobaccofarmers for the purpose of increasing the nicotine content of tobacco.  Thisproposition is absurd.  </tt><p><tt>	First, each of the practices cited by FDA has beenrecommended by the USDA and the State Extension-ResearchServices.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, although certain agronomic practices, such as nitrogenfertilization and sucker control, may incidentally affect nicotine content,they are not designed (or recommended by USDA) for that purpose.  Instead, eachof the practices has demonstrable agronomic benefits quite apart from nicotine.</tt><p><tt>	Third, FDA ignores many other agronomic practices, equally used bythe farmers, that tend to decrease the nicotine content of leaf,e.g., irrigation.</tt> [97]Finally, the recent downward trend in the nicotine content ofleaf has been attributed in large part to changes in agronomic practices.  TheAgency cannot rationally ascribe to such practices some alleged intent by themanufacturers to "manipulate" nicotine. </tt><h4>a.		The Cigarette Manufacturers Do Not</h4><tt><b>			Control the Selection of Agronomic</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Practices by TobaccoFarmers</b></tt><p><p><tt>	American cigarette manufacturers are buyers, not growers, of tobacco.  Thegrowers are tens of thousands of independent farmers.  Tobacco farmers receiveinformation and recommendations concerning agronomic practices from manysources and through several media, including:  USDA publications,</tt> [98 State Extension-ResearchServices,99 agricultural publications, books, media (radio and newspapers),manufacturers of agricultural chemicals, manufacturers of agriculturalequipment, and, to a limited extent, cigarette manufacturers.  The cigarettemanufacturers do not control the USDA, nor do they control the State Extension-ResearchServices, which are agencies of their respective State governments and work incooperation with the USDA.  The cigarette manufacturers likewise do not controlthe other, private sources of information available to farmers.  Nor do theycontrol the farmers' decisions.  Simply stated, the cigarette manufacturerscannot, and do not, dictate how farmers grow their crops.]<h4>b.		Each of the Practices Listed by FDA Has</h4><tt><b>			Been Recommended for Use by Tobacco</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Farmers in USDA Publications</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Each of the agronomic practices cited by FDA as alleged evidence ofnicotine manipulation by the manufacturers has, in fact, been actively promotedby the government of the United States.  The list that follows is only a sampleof the many publications in which USDA and State Extension-ResearchServices urged farmers to follow those practices.  </tt><p><tt><b>Nitrogen</b></tt><p><tt><b>fertilization</b>		United States Department of Agriculture.Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 245.Tobacco Production 1961, at 5, 7-9; 1976, at 5-6, 8-9.

Each of the Practices Listed by FDA Has</h4><tt><b>				Agronomic Benefits Totally Unrelated to</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Nicotine Content and Is Recommended for</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Reasons Unrelated to NicotineContent</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA's list of "nicotine enhancing" agronomic practices is apparently takenfrom two publications, Collins (1981)</tt> [100 and DeJong (1985).101  Both of thepublications note that the agronomic practices in question tend to increase thenicotine content of tobacco leaf.  Unlike FDA, however, neither author suggeststhat these agronomic practices are used ]<tt>for the purpose ofincreasing nicotine content.</tt> [102  Asdemonstrated below, each of the practices on FDA's list has agronomic benefitsunrelated to nicotine content, and is recommended to the farmers by USDA andState Extension-ResearchServices publications for reasons unrelated to nicotine.  ]<h5>(1)	  Nitrogen Fertilizers</h5><tt>	Nitrogen fertilizers are used on a wide array of agricultural products,including tobacco.  Nitrogen fertilizers increase crop yield, but only up to apoint.  Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers decreases the crop yield as wellas the quality of the leaf.</tt> [103  As onepublication states, "The supply of nitrogen must be controlled within narrowlimits; an adequate amount is required for good growth, but an excessive amountlowers quality."104  A State Extension-ResearchServices publication states: <p>"Nitrogen has a greater effect on tobacco yield and quality than any othernutrient.  Too little nitrogen will reduce yield and result in pale, slickcured leaf.  Too much nitrogen may increase yield slightly but may also makemechanical harvesting and curing more difficult, delay maturity, extend curingtime, and result in more unripe cured leaf.  Excessive nitrogen also stimulatessucker growth, which can lead to excessive use of maleic hydrazide (MH) andincrease problems with hornworms and aphids.  Nitrogen is also very leachable,and overapplication may contribute to groundwater contamination in areas withdeep, sandy soils."105<p><p>Because of the problems associated with excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers,the USDA, the State Extension-ResearchServices, and others (including at least one cigarette manufacturer) havecautioned against excessive use of nitrogen.106<p>	The fallacy of FDA's contention with respect to the use of nitrogenfertilizers is readily apparent.  If the cigarette manufacturers controlled thefarmers' sources of information, and if the primary purpose of nitrogenfertilizers were to increase nicotine content, farmers would not be advisedagainst excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers.  If "quality" were synonymouswith "nicotine content," farmers would not be advised that excessive amounts ofnitrogen fertilizers decrease the quality of tobacco leaf.<p>	The trends in the average nicotine content of flue-cured leaf (upward from themid-sixties to 1977, and downward after 1977) can be partially explained bychanges in the rate of application of nitrogen fertilizers.  In 1981, W.K.Collins noted that growers had increased the rate of nitrogen fertilization inthe preceding years, and that North Carolina tobacco fertilizer sales reportsindicated an average usage of over 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre in 1980.Collins also noted that growers were expected to reduce nitrogen fertilizationof the 1981 crop ]<tt>because of a comprehensive educational programabout problems associated with excess nitrogen availability.107  </tt><p><tt>	The USDA and State Extension-ResearchServices publications cited above constitute part of that "comprehensiveeducational program," which advised farmers to use between 50 and 80 pounds ofnitrogen per acre (rather than 100 pounds per acre), depending on soilconditions.  Significantly, the 1979 Tobacco Information publication of theNorth Carolina Agricultural Extension Service makes the followingcomments:</tt><p><tt>"In recent years there has been a trend toward increasing the rate ofnitrogen used on tobacco.  However, due to weather and over-adjustment forleaching, some growers found that they had used too much nitrogen in 1977.Excessive rates of nitrogen delay maturity, increases curing problems and makessucker control more difficult.  In 1978 a general reduction in nitrogen use ontobacco tended to contribute to an improvement in quality."</tt> [108  <p><p>	It is not a mere coincidence that 1977 is the year for which the highestnicotine content in flue-curedtobacco grown in the North Carolina Official Variety Trials (4.16%, unweighted)was reported by North Carolina State University, which was followed by animmediate and dramatic ]<tt>decrease in the nicotine content of theleaf in 1978 and subsequent years.</tt> [109According to DeJong, the high nicotine content of flue-cured tobacco in 1977,which was caused by the combination of very dry weather and excessive use ofnitrogen fertilizers, resulted in ]<tt>wholesale rejection of theflue-cured crop by buyers.</tt> [110  Inother words, the cigarette manufacturers ]<tt>would not buy thehigh-nicotine flue-cured tobacco produced in 1977.  Although FDA purportsto rely upon DeJong's article, the Agency ignores this fact.  </tt><p><tt>	In sum, there is no factual basis for FDA's assertion that cigarettemanufacturers have sought to increase the nicotine content of tobacco throughthe use of nitrogen fertilizers.</tt><h5>(2)	  Early Topping [111]</h5><tt>	Early topping increases crop yield --a goal of any farmer quite unrelated to nicotine.  The loss in crop yieldcaused by delaying topping beyond the early "button" stage for flue-curedtobacco is vividly demonstrated in a 1978 publication of the North CarolinaAgricultural Extension Service:  </tt><p><tt>"After tobacco plants reach the button stage yield potential of untoppedplants is reduced 1% per acre per day.  For many growers this is a reduction ofabout 25 pounds of cured leaf per acre per day.  But, early topping will keepthe yield up because plant resources go into leaf production rather than seedproduction."</tt> [112  <p><H3><a href=vol5.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

INTRODUCTION</h2><p><tt>	FDA relies on the medical device provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, andCosmetic Act (FDCA) to try to construct a wholly new scheme for regulatingcigarettes.  FDA's repeated references to provisions added by the 1976 MedicalDevice Amendments are not mere window dressing; they comprise the very heart ofthe Agency's unprecedented proposal.</tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to treat cigarettes as medical "devices" in order to regulatethem without banning them.  FDA has stated that, if cigarettes were subject tothe FDCA's requirements for drugs, they would be unapproved and would have tobe either (1)shown to be generally recognized as safe and effective or(2)shown to be safe and effective through a new drug application (NDA).60 Fed. Reg. 41,348; see 21 U.S.C. [[section]] 355.  FDA has determinedthat "neither of these outcomes can be viewed as a realistic possibility."  60Fed. Reg. 41,348.  Nevertheless, the Agency has also determined "that a ban onall tobacco products...would not be in the bestinterest of the public health at this time."  Id. at 41,349.  Thus, toachieve its goal of restricting the distribution of cigarettes to young people,without suddenly removing them from the market for adult smokers, the Agencyhas turned to the medical device provisions of the FDCA.  See id.at 41,349.</tt><p><tt>	What FDA has proposed, in both broad conception and its details, departsso sharply from the Agency's prior public statements about the purpose andmeaning of statutory provisions on which it relies that thoughtful analysisseems almost out of place.  Indeed, were it not for the proposal's profoundimpact, it would be difficult to take FDA seriously.  The Agency's treatment ofthe FDCA distorts the law's clear language, ignores requirements mandatorilyapplicable to all medical devices, and regularly fails to acknowledge when itscurrent interpretations of the law depart from positions that it has long heldand only recently endorsed.  </tt><p><tt>	This cavalier approach, of course, is entirely consistent with FDA'ssummary rejection, in Appendix6 to its "Jurisdictional Analysis," of themanufacturers' argument that Congress has not given FDA authority to regulatecigarettes.  This argument, elaborated more fully in Volume I of thesecomments, rests on several grounds:  Congress' adoption of laws regulatingcigarettes that accord FDA no role; Congress' repeated refusal to adoptproposed legislation that would confer jurisdiction on FDA; and the Agency'sown numerous statements to Congress (and the world) that it lacks jurisdictionover cigarettes.  In Appendix6, FDA dismisses all of these facts and thearguments based on them, without mentioning the many prior times that it hadaccepted the facts and agreed with the arguments.</tt><p><tt>	Apparently, FDA's strategy is to acknowledge no doubts about, orimpediments to, its proposal, to overlook any discrepancies between its currentviews and its own prior statements or the law as written, and to press aheadwith a proposal that it hopes will enjoy popular appeal regardless of its lackof legal support.  In this environment, what the law says, how Congressintended it to be used, and even what the Agency thought it meant last month orlast year are mere legal technicalities, to be ignored altogether or dismissedout of hand.</tt><p><tt>	FDA does not explain why it has adopted this cavalier approach, but onetheory fits the content of the Agency's proposal and the reasoning it hasadvanced to support it:  What FDA has put forward was not designed as abona fide proposal to implement existing law.  FDA's leaders areevidently convinced that the government must do more to curb smoking,especially among young people.  They have designed the sort of program thatthey apparently think is responsive to the problem.  They have reliedsubstantially on a report prepared by the Institute of Medicine, whose authorswent out of their way to avoid resolving the troublesome matter of statutoryauthority, but who nevertheless felt compelled to acknowledge that FDAregulation would be "incompatible" with the will of Congress.</tt>"#fn0" [1  <p>	Having designed their program, FDA's leaders must then have examined the lawthe Agency is responsible for administering.  At this juncture, most regulatorswould have paused, for, as these comments demonstrate, the FDCA affords nosupport for FDA's key proposals and squarely conflicts with other proposals.On this occasion, however, the Agency's leaders have put aside anydisappointment with the law's inadequacies.  They have simply reinterpretedstatutory provisions to make them helpful and ignored those that are obstaclesto their program.  The Agency is surprisingly forthright about its approach.At one point, it asserts:<p>"It is within FDA's discretionary power to determine which, if any, of theavailable regulatory authorities it will employ in the regulation of a product.]<tt>See Hecklerv. Chaney, 470 U.S 821 (1985)."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,348.  </tt><p><tt>	In other circumstances, the program FDA has designed would have been putforward by the Administration as proposed legislation.  That is, the programwould have become the Administration's blueprint for a new law.  Thereis no question that a new law would be required to impose the controls FDA hasconstructed.  Instead of appealing for congressional action, however, FDA hasadvanced its plan for cigarettes as a proposal to adopt regulations--regulations that purport to implement a law passed in 1976 to assure thatequipment used in the delivery of medical care is safe and effective.  This,however, is a charade:  What FDA is proposing to enact is nothing less than newlegislation.  FDA does not have this authority; only Congress does.</tt><p><tt>	In a bald effort to legitimize its policy agenda, FDA has recklesslydistorted its own authorizing statute.  It has tried to force cigarettes intothe FDCA's definition of a medical "device" --a category clearly unsuited to tobacco products.  In doing so, it has ignoredthe statutory definition of "device" and disregarded numerous statutoryprovisions which are mandatory for all medical devices.  In essence, FDA hasunlawfully selected only those provisions of the congressional scheme forregulating medical devices that serve the Agency's immediate purpose.  Perhapsmost significantly, in one breath FDA claims that cigarettes are not "safe" andin the next it crams them into a statutory framework that is designed to assurethat only "safe" medical devices are distributed.  This is a hopeless mismatch.That the Agency has had to resort to such contortions clearly demonstrates thatCongress never intended FDA to regulate cigarettes at all.</tt><p><tt>	The following sections detail FDA's pretense.  PartB demonstratesthat FDA's claim that cigarettes may be regulated as medical devices is bothinternally inconsistent and barred by the clear language of the FDCA.PartC critiques FDA's attempt to invoke the "restricted device" authorityof Section520(e) of the FDCA, and shows that this authority was meant topermit controls that confine complex modern medical equipment to use byproperly trained medical professionals and to settings that assure the safetyof patients.</tt>  [2  <p>	In the final analysis, it will be clear that the law on which FDA says itrelies accords the Agency no authority to regulate cigarettes in any fashion,and provides no support for the specific features of its proposed--unlawful-- regulations.]<p><tt></tt><h2>E.	CIGARETTES ARE NOT MEDICAL "DEVICES" </h2><tt>	<b>WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FDCA      </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to regulate cigarettes as medical devices based on itsassertions (1)that nicotine is a "drug" that affects the structure orfunction of the body by chemical means, and (2)that cigarettes are "drugdelivery systems whose purpose is to deliver nicotine to thebody... and, hence, are devices."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,346.  Thisproposal exceeds FDA's statutory authority and defies common sense.  </tt><p><tt>	First, FDA has ignored the legislative history of the FDCA and itsown precedents establishing that the term "device" includes only products withtherapeutic claims.  No such claims are made for cigarettes.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA may not regulate cigarettes as a "device" when it hasexpressly found that they achieve their primary intended purpose throughchemical means; that finding excludes cigarettes from the statutory definitionof "device."  </tt><p><tt>	Third, FDA has misconstrued the "combination product" provisions ofthe FDCA in claiming unfettered authority to regulate a drug delivery system aseither a "drug" or "device," or possibly both.</tt><h3>1.		A Product Must Be Intended for</h3><tt>		<b>Medical Use To Be a Medical "Device"</b></tt><p><tt>		</tt><p><tt>	FDA's entire scheme rests on its assertion that cigarettes aremedical "devices" under the FDCA.  In reaching this conclusion, theAgency ignores the fact that the device provisions of the Act apply only tomedical products-- products for which diagnostic or therapeuticclaims are made expressly or those few products whose intended medical use isobvious from their design, construction, or appearance.  The FDCA does notpermit FDA to regulate just any product that it chooses to call a "device," andit surely does not empower the Agency to regulate cigarettes-- for whichno medical claims are made and which have no obvious medical use.  </tt><p><tt>	Congress first authorized FDA to regulate medical devices in 1938.  The1938 Act defined "devices" as:</tt><p><tt>"instruments, apparatus, and contrivances... intended(1)for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or preventionof disease...; or (2)to affect the structure or anyfunction of the body...."</tt><p><p><tt>Former Section201(h), Pub.L. No.717, 52 Stat. 1041(June25, 1938).  The legislative history demonstrates that Congressintended the term "device" to apply only to products intended formedical purposes.</tt><p><tt>	The House report states that the 1938 Act "extends the scope of the law toinclude cosmetics, therapeutic devices, and certain drugs that nowescape regulation."  H.R.Rep. No.2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.2(1938) (emphasis added).  It further states:  "Therapeutic devices are broughtunder control."  Id<i>.</i>  On the floor of the House, the legislationwas described as providing "control over adulteration and misbranding ofcosmetics and therapeutic devices."  83 Cong. Rec.7774 (May31,1938) (Statement of Rep. Lea).</tt><p><tt>	The evolution of the inclusion of "devices" in the Act shows that both FDAand Congress intended to cover products offered for medical uses.  The initialproposal was to include "devices" within the definition of "drug," so that theterm "drug" would include "all substances, preparations, and devices" intendedfor use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or toaffect the structure or function of the body.  S.1944,[[section]]2(b) (June6, 1933); S.5, [[section]]201(b)(Jan.3, 1935).  Comments on the bill suggested it would be moreappropriate to have a subcategory of the "drug" definition limited to"therapeutic appliances."  Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics:  Hearings onS.5 Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Commerce, 74th Cong.,1st Sess.156 (March 1935) (Statement of Dr. William C. Woodward, AmericanMedical Association).  </tt><p><tt>	A later proposal was to add a separate statutory definition of the term"device."  Id. at 184 (Statement of Hugh Craig, Managing Editor, Oil,Paint, and Drug Reporter, and Associate Editor, The Druggists Circular).Walter Campbell, then head of FDA, testified that the latter proposal would"provide for jurisdiction over the innumerable devices to which therapeuticvirtues are ascribed" without contorting the drug definition.  Id. at352 (Statement of W.G.Campbell, Chief, Food and Drug Administration).  Asa result, the term "device," as defined above, was added to the FDCA.  Again,the purpose was to control "[d]angerous and worthless therapeuticdevices."  H.R.Rep. No.2755, 74th Cong., 2d Sess.3 (1936)(emphasis added).  Thus, under the 1938 Act, Congress authorized FDA toprohibit adulterated or misbranded medical devices.</tt>"#fn2" [3<p>	In 1976, Congress expanded FDA's authority over medical devices to includepremarket review authority (among other new controls).  That legislation, onwhich FDA's tobacco regulations purport to be based, was entitled the"]<tt>Medical Device Amendments of 1976" (emphasis added).</tt>"#fn5" [4  Even though cigarettes bear no medical claims,in proposing to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices" the Agency has ignoredthe legislation's limiting title, which evidences congressional intent.<p>	FDA has also ignored the legislative history of the 1976 Amendments, whichconfirms that Congress' concern was with products that purported to providemedical benefits.  For example, the House Report states:<p>"Although the fantastic claims made for many devices over the years may seemamusing and harmless, use of fraudulent devices can have serious healthconsequences.  Making unwarranted claims for a device, or recommending use inserious disease conditions, may induce a purchaser to forgo seeking timely andappropriate medical treatment."<p><p>H.R.Rep.

No.33, 94th Cong., 1st Sess.3(1975) (discussing "unwarranted claims" made for devices).</tt><p><tt>	The House and Senate reports discussed numerous examples of the "devices"that would be subject to regulation under the Act as amended; but they nowheremention cigarettes.  See H.R.Rep. No.853, supra, at6-9; S.Rep. No.33, supra, at 3-7.  This is hardly surprisingin light of FDA's repeated statements to Congress that it had no jurisdictionover cigarettes.  See Volume I of these comments.</tt><p><tt>	For example, in 1972, after Congress began consideration of legislationthat became the 1976 Amendments, FDA Commissioner CharlesC. Edwards,M.D., testified before a Senate subcommittee that FDA has no jurisdiction overcigarettes marketed without therapeutic claims:</tt><p><tt>"However, cigarettes recommended for smoking pleasure are beyond theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  In Federal TradeCommissionv. Liggett and Myers Tobacco Company (108F.Supp. 573, 1952), it was held that cigarettes are not drugs within themeaning of the act unless a therapeutic purpose is claimed."</tt><p><p><tt>Public Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971:  Hearings on S.1454Before the Consumer Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Commerce, 92d Cong., 2dSess.239 (1972) (Statement of Dr. Charles C. Edwards, Commissioner, Foodand Drug Administration) (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	FDA reiterated this interpretation in response to a petition submittedshortly after passage of the 1976 Amendments.  In 1977, Action on Smoking andHealth (ASH) petitioned FDA to regulate cigarettes containing nicotine asmedical "devices" within the meaning of FDCA [[section]]201(h),21U.S.C. [[section]]321(h).  On November25, 1980, FDAcategorically rejected that petition.  After reviewing the history of thedefinition of "device" set forth in the original FDCA of 1938 and theamendments made to the definition by the Medical Device Amendments of1976,</tt> [5 FDA stated its conclusions inunusually strong language:<p>"Specifically, ]<tt>there is no evidence in the legislative history thatCongress intended to include cigarettes within the definition of 'device'nor does the legislative history contain any discussion of a possibility thatcigarettes were 'devices' within the prior definition.</tt><p><p><tt>"The amendments were thoroughly considered, and the legislative historydiscusses the types of products intended to be regulated and the types ofhealth hazards with respect to which the amendments were intended to provideauthority.  Cigarettes are not mentioned even though Congress was aware of theconsiderable public discussion of the health hazards of cigarette smoking.It is, therefore, not reasonable to consider cigarettes as 'devices'when there was no discussion in the legislative history of congressional intentto provide jurisdiction over cigarettes or to provide authority suitable to theregulation of cigarettes.</tt><p><p><tt>	*       *       *</tt><p><p><tt>"FDA has, however, occasionally had evidence that cigarettes have beenrepresented as effective for the prevention or treatment of respiratory andother diseases or for weight reduction.  FDA has regarded cigarettes which wereso represented by manufacturers or vendors as 'drugs.'  See,e.g., United Statesv. 46Cartons... Fairfax Cigarettes, 113 F.Supp. 336(D.N.J. 1953); United Statesv. 354 BulkCartons... Trim Reducing-AidCigarettes, 178 F.Supp. 847 (D.N.J. 1959)."</tt>"#fn5" [6<p><p>	Thus, after a thorough review of the law on which the Agency now relies, FDArepudiated the very theory that it now embraces.  The Agency relied on twofactors:  (1)lack of any indication of congressional intent that FDAregulate cigarettes as "devices," and (2)lack of "authority suitable tothe regulation of cigarettes."  <p>	Moreover, FDA did not view the question of jurisdiction over cigarettes as"devices" as a close one.  The Agency's own words were:  "]<tt>Itis... not reasonable to consider cigarettes as'devices'..."  (emphasis added).</tt>"#fn5" [7  Of course, nothing in the legislative historyof the 1938 FDCA or the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 has changed since1980.8  In its current plans, however, FDA does not even mention, much lessattempt to respond to, its prior construction of the statute.<p>	In sum, the "device" definition in the FDCA is limited to medical products forwhich therapeutic or diagnostic uses are claimed.  To interpret the definitionwithout reference to this context would lead to absurd consequences neverintended by Congress.<p>	For example, if the statutory context were ignored, FDA could regulate gunsand bullets as "devices" because they are "intended to affect the structure orany function of the body of man or other animals."  FDA could regulate downjackets and flannel pajamas as "devices" because they help to maintain bodyheat during exposure to cold, since temperature regulation is a "function" ofthe body.  FDA could regulate boots and raincoats as "devices" because theykeep the body warm and dry and thus help "prevent...disease," such as frostbite.  FDA could regulate beach umbrellas as "devices"because they shield people from the heat of the sun and the potential for skincancer.  FDA could regulate bicycles or roller skates as "devices" becauseexercise is, or can affect, a function of the body.  The list of suchimprobable examples could go on and on.<p>	However, the FDCA-- and FDA as well-- do have limits.  Congressand the American public would be astounded if FDA tried to assert suchwide-ranging powers.  The reason that FDA could not lawfully claim]<tt>medical "device" jurisdiction over these products is that nomedical claims are made for them.  It would defy common sense toconsider any of them medical "devices" within the meaning of the FDCA.Similarly, it defies common sense to treat cigarettes as medical "devices" whenno medical claims are made for them.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has previously acknowledged that therapeutic claims arenecessary to bring a consumer product within the medical "device" definition.In 1988, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) asked FDA whether homeexercise equipment was a medical device under the FDCA.  FDA's Chief Counselresponded "that home exercise products for which no medical claims are madeshould be regulated as consumer products by CPSC."  Letter from ThomasScarlett, Chief Counsel, FDA, to JamesV. Lacy, Esq., General Counsel,CPSC 2 (May6, 1988).  However, FDA took the position that virtually thesame exercise equipment could be a medical device-- and wasclassified as a "device"-- if therapeutic claims were made for it, suchas "to redevelop muscles or restore motion to joints or for use as an adjuncttreatment for obesity."  Id.; see 21 C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]890.5350-890.5380.</tt>"#fn5" [9<p>	In this exchange FDA accepted the established rule that the physicalproperties or operating principles of a product do not determine whether it isa medical "device."  Both home exercise equipment and medical-purpose exerciseequipment affect the structure or functioning of the body-- indeed, theseeffects are precisely the reason why many people use home exerciseequipment-- but effects alone do not make the equipment a medical device.Rather, it is any representation of therapeutic effects that would causeequipment to be a medical "device."  Without such claims, the equipment ismerely a "consumer product."  This principle was confirmed in a recent courtdecision, ]<tt>United Statesv.<i> </i>Dynamic Classics,Ltd., Civ. No.94-397 (NHP) (Orders and Letter Opinions datedJune2, 1995, and August17, 1995) (not for publication).</tt>"#fn12" [10]<h3>2.		Cigarettes Are Not Medical "Devices"</h3><tt><b>		Because FDA Has Expressly Found That</b></tt><p><tt><b>		They Achieve Their Primary Intended </b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Purposes Through ChemicalMeans</b></tt><p><tt></tt><h4>a.		FDA Has Found That Cigarettes Affect</h4><tt><b>			a Structure or Function of the Body</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Only Through the Supposed </b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Pharmacological Effect of Nicotine </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's determination that a cigarette is a "device" is irreconcilable withthe text of FDCA [[section]]201(h).  Section201(h) provides that a"device" is an article which has the requisite intended use and </tt><p><tt>"which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemicalaction within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependentupon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intendedpurposes."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]321(h) (1994).</tt><p><tt>	Therefore, to be a "device" within the meaning of the FDCA, an articlemust satisfy three conditions:</tt><p><tt>(a)	it must have the requisite intended use;</tt><p><p><tt>(b)	it must "not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemicalaction..."; and</tt><p><p><tt>(c)	it must "not [be] dependent upon being metabolized for the achievementof its primary intended purposes."</tt><p><p><tt>If an article fails to satisfy any one of these three conditions, it is nota medical "device."  It may fall outside FDA's jurisdiction altogether, or itmay be a "drug," but it is not a "device."</tt><p><tt>	Of particular relevance in this proceeding is the fact that an articlethat achieves its primary intended purposes through chemical action is not,under the FDCA, a medical "device."  The legislative history of the MedicalDevice Amendments of 1976 emphasizes that the "chemical action" criterion wasintended to distinguish a "drug" from a "device":</tt><p><tt>"The Committee proposal amends the existing definition of 'device' insection201(h) of the Act to draw a clear distinction between a 'device'and a 'drug.'  The new definition retains (in somewhat more precise detail)provisions of existing law that a device is an article or component thereofwhich is (1)recognized in the official National Formulary or the UnitedStates Pharmacopeia, (2)intended for use in the diagnosis of disease orother conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention ofdisease in man or other animals, or (3)intended to affect the structureor any function of the body of man or other animals.  These characteristics,which also are used in the definition of a 'drug' in section201(g) of theAct, are modified by the proposed legislation to include the distinction thatan article is a device if it 'does not achieve any of its principal intendedpurposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animalsand [if it] is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of anyof its principal intended purposes.'  This distinction means that articlesdependent upon chemical action or being metabolized, and otherwise fallingwithin the definition of 'drug' in section201(p), are to be regulated asdrugs and not as devices."</tt><p><p><tt>H.R.Rep. No.853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.14 (1976) (bracketsin original; emphasis added).</tt>  [11<p>	Cigarettes do not satisfy the second prong of the "device" definition because,under FDA's analysis, cigarettes ]<tt>do achieve their primaryintended purposes through chemical action.  The Agency asserts that theresults of its "extensive investigation and comprehensive legal analysis""support a finding at this time that the nicotine incigarettes... is a drug within the meaning of the act becauseit is intended to affect the structure or function of the body and itachieves its intended effects through chemical action within the humanbody."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,346 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the premise of FDA'slegal analysis is that "cigarettes . . . 'affect the structure or any functionof the body' because they have pharmacological effects . . . ."  60 Fed. Reg.41,467.  FDA also states:  "In the case of cigarettes..., theprimary mode of action is that of a drug, due to thenicotine...."  Id. at 41,348.</tt><p><tt>	FDA does not assert that a cigarette is intended to achieve, or doesachieve, its primary intended effect on the structure or function of the bodyother than by means of the nicotine, which, the Agency says, achieves itssupposed intended purposes by chemical action.  Under FDA's analysis, all theintended effects or purposes of a cigarette are the intended effects orpurposes of the nicotine in the cigarette, and all of those intended effects orpurposes are achieved "through chemical action."  Thus, based on FDA's ownfindings, cigarettes fail the second statutory condition for being medical"devices."  Accordingly, FDA may not regulate them as medical devices.</tt>"#fn17" [12]<h4>b.		A Drug Delivery System Containing </h4><tt>			<b>a Drug Is a "Drug," Not a "Device"</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA asserts that cigarettes "are drug delivery systems," "in that theycontain a drug, nicotine," and "are used to deliver the drug to the site atwhich the drug will be absorbed into the body...."  60Fed. Reg. 41,347.  More specifically, FDA concludes that a "cigarette isanalogous to a metered-doseinhaler, an instrument that converts a drug into an aerosolized form forinhalation and delivery to the lungs for absorption into the bloodstream."Id.  Contrary to FDA's conclusion, these characterizations do not make acigarette a medical "device."</tt><p><tt>	A drug delivery system containing a drug is a "drug," not a "device."Such an article is a "drug" because the article as a whole satisfies thedefinition of "drug" in FDCA [[section]]201(g).  Because such an articleas a whole achieves its primary intended purposes by chemical action, it isexcluded as a whole from the definition of "device" in Section 201(h).</tt><p><tt>	Consistent with this analysis, FDA has long regulated drug deliverysystems containing drugs as "drugs."  FDA's own example makes the point.Products consisting of the drug albuterol with a metered aerosol deliverysystem or a nebulizer delivery system are regulated as drugs.  FDA, ApprovedDrug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations 3-8 (15th ed.1995).</tt> [13  Indeed, only five months beforeproposing that cigarettes be regulated as medical devices because, it says,they are like metered dose inhalers, FDA stated that a metered dose inhaler(MDI) system is a ]<tt>drug product:</tt><p><tt>"[A] MDI consists of the container, the valve, the actuator (mouthpiece),and the formulation [i.e., the drug substance].  These componentscollectively constitute the drug product that delivers the drug substance inthe desired form to the biological target."  60 Fed. Reg. 13,014, 13,016 (Mar.9, 1995).</tt><p><p><tt>	Likewise, nicotine patches (intended use:  smoking cessation) areregulated as drugs, not as "nicotine delivery devices."  FDA, Approved DrugProducts, supra, at 3-214.</tt>  [14<p>	When marijuana is smoked under authority from FDA for medical purposes inclinical investigations, it is a "drug," not a "device."15<p>	In several administrative actions-- involving products called "Favor,""New Chew," "Masterpiece Tobacs," "Nicorette," "Nic Stics," and "Ipco CreamySnuff"-- FDA has asserted jurisdiction over noncigarette,nicotine-containing products either as "drugs" (on the basis of medical claims)or as "foods" (based on their food-like characteristics).16  In]<tt>none of these instances has FDA even suggested the possibilitythat these products were "devices."  In proposing to regulate cigarettes as"devices," FDA ignores all these examples, which are contrary to its newposition.</tt><p><tt>	In 1987, FDA issued a "regulatory letter" to the manufacturer of "Favor.""Favor" was a "plug impregnated with a nicotine solution inserted within asmall tube corresponding in appearance to a conventional cigarette."  Letterfrom Daniel L. Michels to Jay Philip Ray (Feb. 9, 1987), FDA Docket Document8884.  The manufacturer had described the product as "a novel nicotine deliverysystem and a method of administering nicotine by inhalation of nicotine vapor."Id.  Favor "delivers an amount of nicotine per inhalation within a rangeof amounts delivered per inhalation for many conventional combustiblecigarettes."  Id.  FDA concluded that "Favor is a nicotine deliverysystem intended to satisfy a nicotine dependence and to affect the structureand one or more functions of the body... [and that because ofthose] intended uses, Favor is a 'drug' as defined within Section 201(g) of theFDCA."  Id.  FDA did not suggest that Favor was a "device."</tt><p><tt>	FDA has advised the proponent of a roll-ontransdermal applicator "which contains nicotine in the form of a liquified rawtobacco extract," to be sold under the trade name "FUTURE FREE" or "FREEDOM,"that the product is a "drug."  Letter from Kevin M. Budich, Compliance Officer,OTC Compliance Branch, Division of Drug Labeling Compliance, Center for DrugEvaluation and Research, FDA, to Jack R. Ormes, Esq. (Apr. 18, 1989), FDADocket Document 8889.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has advised the manufacturer of "TWENTY-TWOSMOKE-FREECIGARETTES" that its product, which "consists of a single 2-segmenthollow plastic tube .. . and is to be marketed in a package containing 5blister-packedtobacco 'plugs,' . . . [each] comprised of tobacco leaf, tobacco extract,nicotine, binders, and flavoring ingredients," is a "drug" within the meaningof the FDCA.  Letter from Kevin M. Budich, Compliance Officer, OTC ComplianceBranch, Division of Drug Labeling Compliance, Center for Drug Evaluation andResearch, FDA, to Dominic J. Biondi, President, Mechtronics Corporation (Apr.18, 1989), FDA Docket Document 8892.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has advised Ultratech Corporation that its "smokelesscigarette/tobacco square kit," consisting of "a number of small tobacco squaresmanufactured from standard reconstituted sheet tobacco," "a bottle containing asolution of glycerine and sodium bicarbonate (as a solvent/transfer medium),"and "cigarette filter material wrapped in flavored cigarette paper" is a "drug"within the meaning of the FDCA.  Letter from Kevin M. Budich, ComplianceOfficer, OTC Compliance Branch, Division of Drug Labeling Compliance, Centerfor Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, to DavidI. Rosen, UltratechCorporation  (July 21, 1992), FDA Docket Document 8888.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, there is currently pending before FDA a new drug applicationfor a nicotine nasal spray, "a self-administered product consisting of asolution of nicotine in water that is sprayed intranasally and absorbed in thenasal mucosa."  FDA Appendix 1, at A-74. Notably, the manufacturer of the inhaler did not submit a medical devicepremarket approval application to FDA; nor has FDA suggested that such anapplication be filed.  Moreover, FDA's Drug Abuse Advisory Committee (DAAC),which was convened to consider the abuse potential of nicotine nasal sprays,considers such products to be drugs.  See Transcript of the DrugAbuse Advisory Committee Meeting No. 27 (Aug. 1, 1994), at 1.  Further, theDAAC recommended that the nasal spray inhaler be scheduled under the ControlledSubstances Act (CSA).  DAAC Transcript (Aug. 1, 1994), at 230.  The CSAapplies to "drug[s] or other substance[s]," 21 U.S.C. [[section]]811(a);it does not purport to apply to devices.  Accordingly, both the manufacturer ofthe inhaler and FDA itself are treating nicotine nasal sprays as a "drug"rather than a "device."</tt><p><tt>	In other circumstances, FDA has determined that nicotine-containingortobacco-containingproductswere neither drugs nor devices.  In 1978, FDA consideredthe regulatory status of "New Chew," a chewing gum containing 1.4 mg. ofnicotine per stick.  FDA concluded:</tt><p><tt>"A chewing gum product containing 1.4 mg. nicotine per stick and labeledwith no therapeutic claims would not be considered a drug and therefore itwould not require clearance with the Bureau of Drugs."</tt><p><p><tt>Letter from Robert M. Montague, Assistant to the Director, Division of DrugLabeling Compliance, Bureau of Drugs, to Peter N. Georgiades (Jan. 23, 1978).The Agency also did not classify the product as a "device."  Instead, it notedthat, if the product were marketed as a chewing gum, it would be regulated as afood.  Id.  This decision reflects the controlling significance of amanufacturer's claims.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA reached similar conclusions ten years later with respect to"Masterpiece Tobacs," another chewing gum product, which contained tobacco.Letter from John M. Taylor, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, toStuart M. Pape, Esq. (Apr. 12, 1988).</tt>  [17<p>	Under FDA's current theory, both these products would be "nicotine deliverydevices" and therefore both "drugs" and "devices."  The fact that in 1978 and1988 FDA did not so view the products further demonstrates that the Agency'scurrent jurisdictional theory has no support in the law or in prior Agencyunderstanding of the law.<p>	Carried to its logical end, FDA's current theory would convert every drug intoa medical device.  Every final dosage formof a drug-- tablet,capsule, suppository, cream, gel, powder, aerosol, oral liquid suspension,injectable liquid, etc.-- can be viewed as an article consisting of(i)an active ingredient or drug, and (ii)inactive ingredients orcomponents constituting a ]<tt>system for delivery of the activeingredient to the appropriate part of the body.  For regulatory purposes, suchproducts uniformly are "drugs."  This is so even though such systems can behighly sophisticated, and can be the subject of patents apart from the activeingredient.</tt><p><tt>	It would be absurd for FDA to take the position that it can analyze everydrug in final dosage form as a "drug" plus a "device" and regulate it as both a"drug" and a medical "device."  Under such a position, every drug wouldbe subject to regulation as both a "drug" and a "device," despite Congress'enactment of separate statutory authorities for those two kinds ofproducts.</tt> [18  Yet, that is precisely whatFDA has proposed to do with respect to cigarettes.  Under the law, however, FDAmay not treat nicotine in cigarettes as an active drug ingredient and alsoregulate cigarettes as "devices."  If the nicotine in cigarettes is, indeed, a"drug," then the rest of the cigarette is merely a dosage form, not a"device."19<p>	Apart from the critical matter of intended use, a roll of tobacco containingnicotine, surrounded by paper with a filter at one end, is not analyticallydifferent from, for example, an active drug ingredient surrounded by a capsule.The capsule is not a "delivery system" but rather merely a dosage form.  Itwould defy Section201(h)-- as well as congressional intent andcommon sense-- to contend that the presence of the capsule makes thearticle a "device" as well as a "drug."  It similarly defies Section 201(h),congressional intent, and common sense to assert that the tobacco roll, paper,and filter make a cigarette a medical "device."  It cannot be correct that]<tt>every drug in final dosage form ready for use by a patient orconsumer is a medical "device" and subject to regulation as a medical "device"as well as to regulation as a "drug."</tt>  [20<p>	FDA's contrary argument is as follows:<p>"Based on the evidence now before the Agency, cigarettes...are drug delivery systems whose purpose is to deliver nicotine to the body in amanner in which it can be most readily absorbed by the consumer and, hence, aredevices."<p><p>60 Fed. Reg. 41,346.  This is the sum total of FDA's "reasoning" to support itsconclusion that cigarettes are "devices."  FDA thus merely asserts its desiredconclusion; it offers no ]<tt>reason why a drug in a dosage form isa "device."</tt><p><tt>	In an unprecedented, unexplained move, the Agency departs from its longhistory of regulating drug-containing delivery systems as "drugs," not"devices."  Moreover, FDA simply disregards the definitional requirement that adevice must "not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical actionwithin or on the body."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]331(h).  As has been saidabout FDA specifically, "the agency charged with enforcing the Act" cannot bepermitted "to redefine its terms."  United Statesv. Two PlasticDrums... Black Currant Oil..., 761F.Supp. at 74.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, even if FDA had shown that cigarettes satisfied the jurisdictionalrequirement of "intended use,"</tt>  [21 theyfail to satisfy the other requirements of Section 201(h) and therefore are not,and may not be regulated as, medical "devices."  ]<h4>c.		Cigarettes Are Not "Combination Products"</h4><tt>	FDA also asserts that cigarettes are "combination products,"i.e., that each cigarette is both a "drug" and a "device."  60Fed. Reg. 41,346-47.  Under the statutory definitions and FDA's own analysis,that assertion cannot be correct.</tt><p><tt>	As noted above, FDA has determined that a cigarette "achieves its intendedeffects through chemical action within the human body."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,346.That determination implies that a cigarette achieves its primaryintended purposes through chemical action.  An article that achieves itsprimary intended purposes through chemical action cannot satisfy thedefinition of "device" in Section 201(h).  An article that does not satisfy thestatutory definition of "device" is not a combination "drug" and"device."</tt><p><tt>	FDA's argument to the contrary cannot withstand analysis.  The Agencymakes three points.</tt>  [22  The first relatesto the definitions of "drug" and "device."  When the FDCA was enacted in 1938,the definition of "drug" in Section201(g) contained language thatexcluded devices; thus, the definition of "drug" and the definition of "device"were mutually exclusive.23  The Agency notes that such language was removed bythe Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA),24 so that the two definitions areno longer mutually exclusive.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,347.  FDA's second point is thatthe term "device" has been interpreted broadly by the courts.]<tt>Id.  Third, the Agency notes that it has regulated a variety ofarticles as devices.  Id.  These points, separately or together, do notmake cigarettes combination products.</tt><p><tt>	The SMDA's combination product provisions were Congress' response toadvances in biotechnology and medical technology beginning in the 1980s.  Withthese technological advances, an increasing number of therapeutic products weredeveloped that combined a biological product with a drug or a device, orcombined a drug component with a device component.  Examples of such productsare implantable drug pumps, and medical devices (such as orthopedic devices)impregnated with drugs or with licensed biologicals.  See S. Rep. No.513, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1990).  The statutory definitions of "drug" and"device" were mutually exclusive at that time, and thus uncertainty existed asto how FDA would regulate products with drug and device components.Manufacturers of such combination products were faced with regulatory delayswhile FDA tried to decide, on an ad hoc basis, which Center wouldregulate a particular combination product, and sometimes FDA subjected theproduct to dual premarketing reviews.  See id.</tt><p><tt>	In response to manufacturers' concerns about regulatory uncertainty anddelay, Congress enacted Section 503(g) of the FDCA, added by the Safe MedicalDevices Act of 1990, which directs FDA to regulate a combination productaccording to its "primary mode of action."</tt>"#fn36" [25  21 U.S.C. [[section]] 353(g)(1).  Congressalso amended the definitions of "drug" and "device" so that they are no longermutually exclusive, thus recognizing that one product can consist of both a"drug" and a "device" and be regulated according to its primary mode ofaction.<p>	The effect of the 1990 amendments to the definitions of "drug" and "device" isthat, where an article ]<tt>otherwise fits both thedefinition of "drug" and the definition of "device," it may beregulated as a combination drug/device product.  The amendments did not removeall definitional distinctions between "drugs" and "devices."  They did not makeevery "drug" a "device."</tt>  [26<p>	Most importantly, the 1990 amendments also did not make an article a "device"if it does not fit the definition in Section201(h).  Congress did notremove from Section201(h) the provision excluding from the definition of"device" articles that "achieve [their] primary intended purposes throughchemical action within or on the body."27  That language remains in thestatutory text, and it has a real effect:  It ]<tt>excludesfrom the definition of "device" articles that achieve theirprimary intended purposes through chemical action.</tt><p><tt>	The 1990 amendment to the "drug" definition in Section201(g)recognizes that there may be genuine drug/device combination products.  Forexample, an article is a device if it meets the definition of "device," whichmeans, among other things, that it does not achieve its primary intendedpurpose by chemical action.  The same article can also be a "drug" if itachieves a secondary-- but not itsprimary-- intended purpose by chemical action.</tt>"#fn53" [28  Such circumstances are not present here,however.  An article that achieves its primary intended purposes by chemicalaction, as FDA claims that a cigarette does, cannot be a "device."<p>	As to FDA's second point, the fact that the term "device" has been interpretedbroadly by the courts does not mean that an article which achieves its primaryintended purposes through chemical action is a "device."  No judicial oradministrative authority cited by FDA supports (or could support) ignoring theprovision of Section201(h) that a medical "device" may"]<tt>not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemicalaction."  Prior to FDA's assertion of "device" jurisdiction over cigarettes, nocourt, nor the Agency in any particular matter, had ever treated as a "device"a product that achieves its primary intended purposes through chemicalaction.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's third point-- that it has regulated a variety of products as"devices"-- while no doubt true, is in this context a nonsequitur.  None of the examples given by FDA involves an article thatachieves its primary intended purposes "through chemical action within or onthe body."  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,347.

FDA Does Not Have the Unfettered </h4><tt><b>			Discretion It Asserts To Choose </b></tt><p><tt>			<b>or Ignore Regulatory Requirements</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that, with respect to articles that are both drugs anddevices, it has complete discretion to decide which, if any, regulatoryauthorities to apply.  Apparently, under FDA's theory, the Agency must regulatea "drug" as Congress intended, and it must regulate a "device" as Congressintended; but, if an article is a "drug" and a "device," the Agency may exemptit from some or all of the mandatory provisions in the statute that Congressintended to apply to "drugs" and some or all of the mandatory provisions thatCongress intended to apply to "devices."</tt>"#fn59" [31<p>	This is truly a breathtaking, and wholly unprecedented, assertion of Agencyauthority to override the will of Congress.32  FDA has never before contendedthat it can regulate a "device" as a "drug," or a "drug" as a "device," or acombination any way it sees fit.  Moreover, whenever FDA has asserted authorityto disregard mandatory provisions of the FDCA, the courts have rejected itsactions.33<p>	The Medical Device Amendments of 1976-- while making device regulationmore comprehensive-- were intended to ]<tt>restrict andnarrow FDA's discretion to fashion regulatory requirements.  This intentwas articulated by RepresentativePaul Rogers, who, as Chairman of theHouse Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, was the principal author andHouse floor manager of the legislation.  In response to the charge that thelegislation would lead to more regulations and bureaucracy, he replied asfollows:</tt><p><tt>	"What we have done is write a bill specific enough so that we just do notturn over to a bureaucracy and allow them to write whatever and however theywant.</tt><p><p><tt>	*       *       *</tt><p><p><tt>	"...We do not turn over broad authority to the Food andDrug Administration and let them write regulations any way they want to.</tt><p><p><tt>	"We have been specific because we believe the Congress should write thelaw specifically.  The committee does not intend to allow regulatory agenciesto do anything they want to."</tt><p><p><tt>122 Cong. Rec.5851 (1976).</tt>  [34<p><p>	RepresentativeRogers' authoritative statement is diametrically opposedto FDA's assertion of unlimited discretion to draw upon the 1976 Amendments asa set of tools to construct a new regulatory program for cigarettes thatexceeds anything Congress contemplated-- for a product Congress neverintended FDA to regulate at all.<p>	Consistent with RepresentativeRogers' characterization, the medicaldevice provisions of the FDCA specify, and thus limit, FDA's discretion toexempt devices from specific statutory requirements.  Section520(a) ofthe FDCA provides:<p>	"Any requirement authorized by or under section351, 352, 360, or 360i[FDCA [[section]][[section]]501, 502, 510, or 519] of this titleapplicable to a device intended for human use ]<tt>shall apply tosuch device until the applicability of the requirement to the device has beenchanged by action taken under section360c, 360d, or 360e [FDCA[[section]][[section]]513, 514, or 515] of this title or undersubsection(g) of this section... ."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360j(a) (emphasis added).  </tt><p><tt>	This language does four things.  First, it gives FDA authority toexempt specific devices from specific statutory requirements(i.e., those imposed by or under Sections501, 502, 510, and519).  Second, it prescribes the procedure by which such exemptions areto be granted (i.e., by action under Sections 513, 514, 515, or520(g)).  Third, it unequivocally mandates that the requirements imposedby or under Sections501, 502, 510, or 519 shall continue to applyto a device, unless and until action under Sections 513, 514, 515, or 520(g)has been taken to confer an exemption.  Section520 thus expressly deniesFDA authority to waive those requirements by other means.  Fourth,Section 520(a) omits any grant to FDA of authority to waive other requirements,e.g., those imposed by Section513 (classification) andSection515 (premarket approval).</tt><p><tt>	FDA has not taken (or even proposed) any action under Sections513,514, 515, or 520(g) to exempt cigarettes-- even if they were medicaldevices-- from any requirement imposed by or under Sections501,502, 510, or 519.</tt> [35  Therefore, FDA hasno authority or discretion to waive any of those requirements.<p>	Two important conclusions follow from FDA's lack of authority to waive anyrequirement referred to in Section520(a) by any means other than theprocedure specified therein.  ]<tt>First, it shows that FDA does nothave anything like the broad discretion it asserts to choose among statutoryauthorities in its effort to construct a regulatory program for cigarettes.Second, it shows that FDA cannot escape the statutory contradictions andlegal inconsistencies created by its attempt to regulate cigarettes as medical"devices."  This latter point is explored further below, in Part C.5.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's discretion is further limited by Sections514(a)(2)(B)(v) and515(d)(1)(B)(ii), which prohibit the Agency from using product performancestandards or premarket approval of a device to restrict the sale, distribution,or use of devices except to the extent permitted by Section520(e).21U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]360d(a)(2)(B)(v),360e(d)(1)(B)(ii).</tt><p><tt>	Finally, FDA has been held not to have discretion to permit "massmarketing" of a "device" by "emasculat[ing]" statutory requirements.

Section 503(g) of the FDCA Does</h4><tt>			<b>Not Give FDA Such Discretion</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA's reliance on new Section503(g) as a grant of sweepingdiscretion to apply or ignore statutory requirements for articles that are botha "drug" and a "device" is misplaced.  The statute deals only with a matter ofinternal FDA management.  Moreover, it was intended to reduce, not enlarge,FDA's discretion.</tt><p><tt>	Section503(g) does not make an article a medical "device," a"drug," or both; and it does not create a new regulatory category ofcombination products.  Rather, it recognizes that some articles may satisfymore than one statutory definition, and that some clear rule is needed todetermine which administrative unit within FDA (the unit that regulates"drugs," the unit that regulates "devices," or the unit that regulatesbiological products) shall regulate, and review applications for approval of,such products.</tt><h5>(i)		The Text of Section503(g)</h5><tt>	Section503(g) provides:</tt><p><tt>"(1)  The Secretary shall designate a component of the Food and DrugAdministration to regulate products that constitute a combination of a drug,device, or biological product.  The Secretary shall determine the primary modeof action of the combination product.  If the Secretary determines that theprimary mode of action is that of--</tt><p><p><tt>	(A)	a drug (other than a biological product), the persons charged withpremarket review of drugs shall have primary jurisdiction, </tt><p><p><tt>	(B)	a device, the persons charged with premarket review of devices shallhave primary jurisdiction, or</tt><p><p><tt>	(C)	a biological product, the persons charged with premarket review ofbiological products shall have primary jurisdiction.</tt><p><p><tt>(2)	Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Secretary from using anyagency resources of the Food and Drug Administration necessary to ensureadequate review of the safety, effectiveness, or substantial equivalence of anarticle.</tt><p><p><tt>(3)	The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to implement marketclearance procedures in accordance with paragraphs(1)and (2)... ."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]353(g).  This statutory text makes severalpoints clear.</tt><p><tt>	First, all that Section503(g) addresses is the determinationof which FDA unit will regulate, and review an application for premarketapproval of, a product that falls within two or more product categories.Section503(g) does not address or affect the substantive statutoryprovisions that shall apply to such a product.</tt><p><tt>	Second, the statute diminishes FDA's discretion in assigningadministrative responsibility for premarket review of medical products.  Priorto Section 503(g), FDA exercised discretion in deciding which group (or groups)of Agency employees would regulate and conduct the premarket review (ormultiple reviews) of combination products.  Section503(g) takes away thatdiscretion.  Now, FDA is required to determine the "primary mode of action ofthe combination product."  21U.S.C. [[section]]353(g)(1).  Thatdetermination is not a matter of discretion or "policy," but rather ofobjective scientific assessment.</tt><p><tt>	Section503(g)(1)(A), (B), and (C) prescribe with exactitude whichunit within FDA is to regulate, and conduct the review of, a combinationproduct:  if the primary mode of action is that of a drug (other than abiological product), the drug group has jurisdiction; if the primary mode ofaction is that of a device, the device group has jurisdiction; if the primarymode of action is that of a biological product, the biological products grouphas jurisdiction.  That choice is not left to FDA.  FDA is flouting thiscongressional mandate by asserting that the primary mode of action ofcigarettes is that of a drug, and that, therefore, the drug group (CDER) willhave jurisdiction, and yet the Act's medical device authorities will apply.Congress did not intend to assign primary jurisdiction over a medical device toa group at FDA that knows little about the regulation of devices; indeed, asdiscussed below, the very purpose of Section503(g) was to prevent thiskind of mis-assignmentfrom occurring.</tt><p><tt>	Third, Section503(g) has no bearing on the meaning of theterm "drug" or on the meaning of the term "device."  It does not modify thedefinition of "drug" or the definition of "device."  It merely provides theframework for regulating articles that, independently of Section503(g),fall within two of the three jurisdictional categories:  drug, device, andbiological product.</tt><h5>(ii)		The Legislative History </h5><tt>				<b>of Section503(g)      </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The legislative history of Section503(g) does not support FDA'sclaim of expanded discretion to categorize an article as a "drug" or "device"or to select the regulatory authorities that will apply to an article.</tt><p><tt>	Section503(g) was enacted as part of Section16 of the SafeMedical Devices Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4511, 4526 (1990) ("SMDA").  Theprovisions of Section16 are currently codified in FDCA[[section]][[section]]503(g),201(g) and 201(h).</tt><p><tt>	Section16 originated in the Senate bill, S.3006, 101st Cong.,2d Sess. (1990).  There was no counterpart in the House bill, H.R.3095,101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989).</tt>  [36  Thepredecessor of the Senate bill was introduced by Senator Kennedy.  136 Cong.Rec. S12487-95 (daily ed. Aug.4, 1990).  The bill included, inSections19 and 20, predecessors of what became Sections19 and 20 inthe reported Senate bill and Sections16(a) and 16(b) in the enactedlegislation.  ]<tt>Id. at S12493.  Senator Kennedy commented onthese provisions:  "The bill improves efficiency in the FDA review process byproviding that the Secretary will require only one market clearance route forproducts which are combinations of devices, drugs, or biologics."  Id.at S12489.  Senator Dodd, a co-sponsor of the bill, commented to the sameeffect.  Id. at S12494.  Thus, the manifest purpose of the provisionswas not to expand FDA's powers or to enlarge the universe of combinationproducts, but rather to solve a problem of regulatory duplication by preventingFDA from requiring multiple "market clearance route[s]" for combinationproducts.</tt><p><tt>	Later, in urging acceptance of the Conference Report, Senator Kennedy, theSenate floor manager of the bill, stated:  "Recognizing the tremendous growthin biotechnology, the legislation streamlines regulatory review procedures forso-called combination products comprising any combination of drugs, devices orbiologics."  136 Cong. Rec. S17457 (daily ed. Oct.27, 1990).  SenatorDodd, see 136 Cong. Rec. S15210 (daily ed. Oct.12, 1990),observed:</tt><p><tt>"The legislation includes three unique provisions which recognize thetremendous growth in biotechnology and the new challenges of global competitionwhich will be brought about by the changes in the European Community in1992....  The legislation...streamlines the regulatory review procedures for so-called combination productscomprising any combination of drugs, devices, or biologics."</tt><p><p><tt>136 Cong. Rec. S17457 (daily ed. Oct.27, 1990).  Thus, the provisionsrelating to combination products were understood as addressing a problem thatprimarily affected the review of applications for approval of products thatwere both a biologic and a drug or device.</tt>"#fn79" [37<p>	The only other substantive comments on Section16 in the legislativehistory appear in the Senate Report.  The Senate bill included asSection19 what was enacted as Section16(b) (amendments to FDCA[[section]]201) and as Section20 what was enacted asSection16(a) (amendment adding Section503(g)).  Under "CommitteeViews," the Report states:<p>	"The Committee is aware of the difficulty under the present law in determiningthe jurisdictional base for regulating products that are comprised ofcombinations of drugs, devices, or biologics.  This provision will provide theSecretary with ]<tt>firm ground rules to direct productspromptly to that part of the FDA responsible for reviewing thearticle that provides the primary mode of action of the combinationproduct.  Various persons from industry have expressed the view that aweakness in FDA's premarket review process is the determination of how toregulate combination products.  This provision should assist the Secretary inavoiding delays in making that determination, and is important since morecombination products are coming before the agency for premarket review, forexample, devices impregnated with biologically-active materials, medicateddevices, implantable drug pumps and biological sensors, and therapeutic devicesused in conjunction with drugs for the extra-corporeal treatment ofdiseases.</tt><p><p><tt>	"The definitions of 'drug' and 'device' have been slightly altered toaccommodate the principle of section20.  Section19 amendssection201(g)(1)(D) by deleting from the drug definition the words 'butdoes not include devices or their components, parts, or accessories.'  Bydeleting this language, a product whose primary mode of action is attributableto a drug, but has a device component, may be reviewed under the Act's drugauthority.  Section19 also amends section201(h) to delete the words'any of' from the unnumbered paragraph following section201(h)(3).Additionally, the word 'primary' is substituted for the word 'principal' inthat same paragraph.  These changes are editorial and conform the devicedefinition to the language in section20."</tt><p><p><tt>S.Rep. No.513, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.30-31 (1990)(emphasis added).  The section-by-sectionanalysis similarly states:</tt><p><tt>	"Section20 amends section503 of the act and describes thegeneral procedures for determining the appropriate component of the FDA toreview premarket submissions for products that are comprised of any combinationof drugs, devices, or biologicals.  If the Secretary determines that theprimary mode of action of the combination product is associated with drugs,devices, or biologicals, then the Secretary shall assign to theorganizational unit within FDA, charged with the premarket review of theelement associated with the product's primary mode of action, theresponsibility to review the premarket submission of the combination product.However, the Secretary will retain the authority to use any FDA resourcesnecessary to ensure an adequate premarket review.  The section also requiresthe Secretary to promulgate regulations within one year of its enactment dateto implement procedures for facilitating the premarket review of combinationproducts.  Section20 also defines the terms 'biological product' and'market clearance,' as used within the section."</tt><p><p><tt>Id. at 42-43 (emphasis added).  </tt><p><tt>	The explanation in the Senate Report confirms the following points:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Section503(g) was intended to address a specificproblem brought to the Committee's attention by the regulated industry.Section503(g) was not enacted in response to a request by FDA foradditional authority or to create a new class of combination products.</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	The problem involved FDA's review of combination products;i.e., as a result of uncertainty about how such products were tobe reviewed and/or FDA's propensity to require review by two units, approvalsof such products were being unduly delayed.</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	The legislative solution was to establish "firm groundrules" for choosing one unit in FDA that would conduct the premarketreview of a combination product.  Thus, the section-by-sectionanalysis states:  "If the Secretary determines that the primary mode of actionof the combination product is associated with drugs, devices, or biologicals,then the Secretary shall assign to the organizational unit within FDA,charged with the premarket review of the element associated with the product'sprimary mode of action, the responsibility to review the premarket submissionof the combination product."  Id. (emphasis added).</tt>"#fn79" [38<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Congress understood that Section503(g) dealt only with"procedures for facilitating the premarket review of combination products," anddid not expand FDA's authority or discretion.  Id.  This was also FDA'scontemporaneous understanding, confirmed by its decision to promulgate theimplementing regulation without notice and comment by invoking theAdministrative Procedure Act's exceptions for rules "relating to agencymanagement" and "agency organization, procedure, or practice," 5U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]553(a)(2) and (b)(A).  See 56 Fed. Reg.58,754, 58,755 (1991).</tt><p><tt>	Based on the statutory text and this legislative history, several otherpoints are also clear:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	SMDA [[section]] 16 affected the definitions of "drug" and"device" only by removing the provision that made the categories of "drug" and"device" mutually exclusive and by making an "editorial" change in thedefinition of "device."  The SMDA did not define the term "combination," anddid not make it possible for an article to be a combination "drug/device"without satisfying the definitions of both "drug" and "device."  </tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	SMDA [[section]]16 left intact-- afterCongress focused on and made one "editorial" change in-- the language inSection201(h) that limits the term "device" to an article "which does notachieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on thebody of man or other animals."  If Congress had intended to give FDA discretionto regulate, under the medical device provisions, an article that doesachieve its primary purposes through chemical action, it easily could have, andcertainly would have, deleted that language; but it did not do so.</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	SMDA [[section]]16(a), codified asSection503(g), is chiefly concerned with designating the one unit withinFDA that will be responsible for reviewing the marketing application for acombination product.</tt>  [39  Where noapplication for premarket approval is at issue (as is the case withcigarettes), the problem that Section503(g) was intended to address doesnot arise, and the Section does not apply.<p>	]&#176;<tt>	If an article satisfies the separate "drug" and "device"definitions, it can be regulated by FDA as a "drug" and a"device"-- i.e., FDA can apply to it both "drug"authorities and "device" authorities (in accordance with statutory mandates,preconditions, and limitations).  If, however, an article does not satisfy bothdefinitions, Section503(g) does not authorize FDA to regulate the articleas if it did.  </tt><h4>c.

Reg. 41,348.  This claim isabsurd.</tt><p><tt>	Section3.2(e) merely defines the term "combination product."  Itdoes not modify the definition of "drug" or "device."  Indeed, 21C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]3.2(f) and (g), which immediately followSection3.2(e), expressly incorporate the statutory definitions of thoseterms.  Therefore, of course, those statutory definitions governSection3.2(e).  </tt><p><tt>	Section3.2(e) also does not confer any additional authority on FDA,but merely implements Section503(g).  In short, Section3.2(e) isnothing but a definition.  It has no operative provisions.  </tt><p><tt>	Moreover, Section3.2(e) was issued without notice and commentbecause, FDA claimed at the time, it affects only Agency management,organization, procedure, and practice.  See 21C.F.R.[[section]]3.1 (1995) ("This regulation relates to agency management andorganization"); 56 Fed. Reg. 58,754, 58,755 (1991).  Thus, FDA recognized thatSection3.2(e) has no substantive effect.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, it is frivolous for FDA to rely on this inconsequential regulatorydefinition in 21 C.F.R. [[section]] 3.2(e) to support its assertion of sweepingauthority to disregard mandatory statutory provisions governing the regulationof "drugs" and "devices" and to construct a wholly new regulatory system forcigarettes.</tt>  [40]<h4>d.		Hecklerv. Chaney Does Not Give</h4><tt><b>			FDA Discretion To Ignore Mandatory</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>StatutoryProvisions&nbs;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA invokes Hecklerv. Chaney, 470 U.S.821 (1985), for its bold claim that it has "discretionary power to determinewhich, if any, of the available regulatory authorities it will employ in theregulation of a product."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,348.  Chaney, however, dealswith Agency discretion in an entirely unrelated and very narrow context --whether to initiate enforcement action against violations of the Act.  It doesnot add to FDA's discretion in any other respect (e.g., creationof new regulatory programs, imposition of new regulatory requirements orprohibitions), and does not provide even tenuous support for FDA's novelassertion of discretion to regulate combination products however it seesfit.</tt><p><tt>	The Court's opinion in Chaney opens with a precise statement of thequestion presented:</tt><p><tt>"This case presents the question of the extent to which a decision of anadministrative agency to exercise its 'discretion' not to undertake certainenforcement actions is subject to judicial review under the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5U.S.C. [[section]]501 et seq.(APA)."</tt><p><p><tt>470 U.S. at 823.  Thus, the issue in Chaney was not how muchdiscretion agencies have to undertake enforcement actions, but rather whether adecision not to take certain enforcement action is judiciallyreviewable.  Chaney is irrelevant to this rulemaking because FDAdoes not contend, nor could it, that no judicial review is available of itsdecision to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes or of its decisions to invokecertain authorities and not others in its regulation of cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	In Chaney, FDA had been petitioned by state prisoners to takeenforcement action against the unapproved use of FDA-regulated drugs inexecutions by prison authorities pursuant to State law.  FDA declined to takesuch action, and the prisoners sued FDA.  They claimed that the Agency wasunder legal obligation to institute enforcement proceedings against what theyclaimed were clear violations of the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court's holding was precise and limited:</tt><p><tt>"We therefore conclude that the presumption that agency decisions not toinstitute proceedings are unreviewable under 5U.S.C.[[section]]701(a)(2) [of the APA] is not overcome by the enforcementprovisions of the FDCA.  The FDA's decision not to take the enforcement actionsrequested by respondents is therefore not subject to judicial review under theAPA.  The general exception to reviewability provided by[[section]]701(a)(2) for action 'committed to agency discretion' remainsa narrow one, [citation], but within that exception are included agencyrefusals to institute investigative or enforcement proceedings, unless Congresshas indicated otherwise."</tt><p><p><tt>Id. at 837-38.  </tt><p><tt>	Plainly, Hecklerv. Chaney has no bearing on the kindof discretion FDA now claims.  The issue in this rulemaking proceeding is notwhether a court can review a decision by FDA not to take enforcement action ina specific case.  Rather, the issue is whether FDA can create, without expresslegislative authorization, a wholly new regulatory scheme for cigarettes byselecting some regulatory authorities granted to it by Congress (for otherpurposes) and ignoring other provisions, including mandatory ones.Hecklerv. Chaney does not recognize any such authority.Indeed, the Supreme Court was careful to admonish that "Congress did not setagencies free to disregard legislative direction in the statutory scheme thatthe agency administers."  Id. at 833.</tt>"#fn90" [41<p>	*        *        *<p>	In sum, cigarettes cannot be medical devices.  Based on FDA's finding thatcigarettes produce a pharmacological effect in the body, they cannot be a"device" under Section 201(h).  Similarly, since their "primary mode ofaction," according to FDA, is a pharmacological effect of nicotine, even as acombination product cigarettes could not be governed by the device provisions,pursuant to the directive in Section 503(g).  Finally, FDA's assertion thatcigarettes containing nicotine should be regulated as drug-delivery "devices"is contrary to numerous precedents involving drug-delivery systems as well asnicotine-containing products.  <p>]<h2>F.

Reg. 41,349-50.</tt><p><tt>	In this one sentence, FDA concludes that no restrictions can be imposedwhich would provide reasonable assurance of the safety (or effectiveness) ofcigarettes for any person who does use them.  This conclusiondemonstrates that, even if FDA were able to treat cigarettes as medical"devices," it may not under the law regulate them as "restricted devices."</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, FDA intends to allow the continued sale of cigarettes over-the-counter(OTC), without the intervention of a health professional.  Cigarettes,therefore, cannot be "restricted" devices, because Congress did not intendSection520(e) to apply to purely OTC products.  </tt><p><tt>	Finally, even if cigarettes could be regulated as restricted medicaldevices, the specific restrictions FDA has proposed exceed its statutoryauthority under the FDCA.</tt><h3>1.		Section520(e) Only Permits FDA To Restrict</h3><tt><b>		Medical Devices To Use by or Under the Supervision</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>of Qualified Health Professionals      </b></tt><p><tt></tt><h4>a.		Statute and Legislative History</h4><p><tt>	Prior to the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, FDApromulgated a "prescription" device regulation.  21C.F.R.[[section]]801.109 (1995).  That regulation, still in effect, providesthat certain devices may be sold or distributed only to, or on the prescriptionor other order of, a licensed practitioner.  The regulation was based onSection502(f)(1), the same provision on which FDA had originally reliedto limit potent drugs to prescription sale.  The Agency's reasoning also wassimilar; i.e., that adequate directions for safe use of suchdevices by laypersons could not be written.  </tt><p><tt>	When Congress strengthened FDA's device regulatory controls in 1976, itadded Section520(e), the "restricted devices" authority.Section520(e)(1) provides:</tt><p><tt>"(1)	The Secretary may by regulation require that a device be restricted tosale, distribution, or use--</tt><p><p><tt>	(A)	only upon the written or oral authorization of a practitioner licensedby law to administer or use such device, or</tt><p><p><tt>	(B)	upon such other condition as the Secretary may prescribe in suchregulations,</tt><p><p><tt>if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateralmeasures necessary to its use, the Secretary determines that there cannototherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.  Nocondition prescribed under subparagraph(B) may restrict the use of adevice to persons with specific training or experience in its use or to personsfor use in certain facilities unless the Secretary determines that such arestriction is required for the safe and effective use of the device.  No suchcondition may exclude a person from using a device solely because the persondoes not have the training or experience to make him eligible for certificationby a certifying board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialtiesor has not been certified by such a Board.  A device subject to a regulationunder this subsection is a restricted device."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360j(e).  </tt><p><tt>	This statutory language clearly shows that the restricted devicesauthority was intended for (A)devices that, under the existingregulation, were limited to sale on the prescription of a licensed physician or(B) devices that would require other conditions to assure safe and effectiveuse.  The sort of conditions contemplated were restrictions limiting a deviceto use by professionals specifically trained in its use (including nurses orothers) or to use in specific medical settings.</tt><p><tt>	The House Committee report on the 1976 Amendments confirms thisinterpretation that "restricted devices" were not intended to be available tolaypersons, i.e., were devices limited to purchase or use by, orunder the supervision of, a health professional:</tt><p><tt>	"Restricted Devices-- Because of the sophistication andpotentially hazardous nature of some medical devices, the proposed legislationauthorizes the Secretary to require that the sale or distribution of a devicebe restricted if he determines that, because of its potentiality for harmfuleffect or the collateral measures necessary to its use, there cannot otherwisebe reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.  Under this provision(new section520(e) of the Act), such a device may be restricted to theextent that it may be sold or distributed only upon the oral or writtenauthorization of a practitioner licensed by law to administer or use thedevice, or upon such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, exceptthat no condition limiting the use of a device to categories of physiciansdefined by their training or experience may be imposed.</tt><p><p><tt>	"This provision supersedes and adds to existing authority utilized by theFood and Drug Administration to require that certain devices be dispensed onlyupon prescription.  (This authority is derived from section502(f) of theAct, which authorizes exemptions to the requirement that all devices bearadequate directions for use.  The Food and Drug Administration's contentionthat such an exemption may be conditioned upon the use of a device only by oron the order of a licensed practitioner has been upheld by the courts.)</tt><p><p><tt>	"In addition to authorizing the Secretary to limit a device toprescription status, conditions on sale or distribution could include use onlywithin hospitals or clinics.  Also, there are categories of healthprofessionals other than physicians that have unique skills appropriate to theuse of medical devices such that certain devices which would not beappropriate for use by the ordinary layman could be authorized for use bytrained nurses and technicians."</tt><p><p><tt>H.R.Rep. No.853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.24-25 (1976)(emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW), FDA's parent,held the same view.  It understood that the restrictions authorized to beimposed under clause(B) of Section520(e)(1) were those for medicalproducts that could not be used safely by laypersons-- and, indeed, couldnot be used appropriately by some professionals.  Undersecretary Margaret Lynchsubmitted this analysis of the House bill's version of Section520(e),which would have included a proviso forbidding FDA from restricting use of adevice to a subcategory of physicians:</tt><p><tt>"This provision [the proposed proviso] will seriously undermine theAgency's ability to reduce public exposure to medical devices that may beunsafe in the hands of practitioners who lack the training or experience to usethem.  Also, the effect... may be to discourage FDA approvalfor commercial marketing of products that will provide great benefits topatients when used by skilled practitioners, but which present unreasonablerisk to patients if used too widely by the untrained....This matter is a serious concern with the increasing sophistication of medicaldevices."</tt><p><p><tt>122 Cong. Rec.5854 (1976).</tt><p><tt>	The need for explicit restricted medical device authority was highlightedfor Congress by a lawsuit challenging FDA's methadone regulations, which wasdecided during the period the Medical Device Amendments were underconsideration.  In American Pharmaceutical Ass'nv.Weinberger, 377 F.Supp. 824, 831 (D.D.C. 1974), aff'd, 530F.2d 1054 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (per curiam), the court struck down FDA regulationsaimed at confining methadone distribution to approved drug treatment programs.In doing so, the court specifically rejected FDA's argument that its authorityto assure drug "safety" extended to restricting distribution of the drug (tohospital pharmacies and licensed drug treatment clinics) in order to secure itfrom misuse.  Id. at 828.  The court emphasized that the applicablesafety standard referred only to "the inherent safety of the drug when used inthe manner intended."  Id.42  </tt><p><tt>	Section520(e), adopted in the wake of the American PharmaceuticalAssociation decision, was thus intended to grant FDA authority to restrictthe distribution of medical devices to settings more limited than allphysicians (or all pharmacies) in which patient safety could be assured.</tt>"#fn93" [43<p>	Three congressional objectives are clear from the language ofSection520(e) and its legislative history.  ]<tt>First, therestricted device provisions were intended to permit regulation ofmedical equipment used in the delivery of medical care.Second, restricted status for a medical device was envisioned asanalogous to prescription status for a drug-- but with an importantdifference:  FDA was not limited to restricting sale to the order of a licensedphysician, as it was for drugs; the Agency could define the universe ofeligible professional users more narrowly.  Third, the only restrictionsauthorized, however, were those necessary to ensure that a device would be safeand effective for patients in whose treatment it was used.</tt><p><tt>	The fact that the contours of FDA's announced plans for cigarettes bear noresemblance to these purposes exposes the Agency's opportunistic exploitationof its restricted device authority to rationalize its wholly unrelated schemefor cigarettes.  Lacking genuine authority, FDA contorts the restricted deviceauthority beyond recognition in an effort to cover cigarettes-- a productthat has no role in the delivery of medical care, is (and will remain) soldexclusively over-the-counter,and for which the Agency would impose restrictions that it asserts would notassure the safety of any use of cigarettes.  The regulatory scheme the Agencyhas fabricated has no basis in the statute, and FDA lacks any power to adoptit.</tt><h4>b.		Administrative Precedents</h4><tt>	FDA has previously expressed an understanding of Section520(e) thatis at odds with its plans for cigarettes.  When the Agency first proposedregulations to implement Section520(e), it interpreted the statute asfollows:  "[R]estricted devices... can be used safely andeffectively only by, on the order of, or under the supervision of a healthprofessional."  45 Fed. Reg. 65,619, 65,620 (Oct. 3, 1980) (proposal withdrawnat 46 Fed. Reg. 57,569 (Nov. 24, 1981)).  </tt><p><tt>	Hearing aids are the only devices that FDA has thus far restricted byregulation under Section520(e).  See 21C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]801.420, 801.421 (1995).  One of the prescribedconditions for the sale of hearing aids is that the patient present to thehearing aid dispenser a written statement by a licensed physician that amedical evaluation has been performed and that the individual is a candidatefor a hearing aid.  However, an adult patient may waive the medical evaluationrequirement after receiving from the dispenser and executing a specifiedinformed consent form.  Id. [[section]]801.421(a).  Although themedical evaluation restriction does not require that a hearing aid beprescribed by a physician (see 42 Fed. Reg. 9286, 9288 (Feb. 15, 1977)),it does incorporate a health professional into the sale of the device.  Thewaiver provision likewise interposes a health professional-- the hearingaid dispenser-- who under the laws of most states must have been trainedto provide the relevant health-related information to the prospectivepurchaser.  As FDA stated:  "[T]he Commissioner regards the hearing aiddispenser as an important member of the hearing health care team, strategicallypositioned within the delivery system to provide the hearing aid user withessential services."  Id. at 9287.</tt><p><tt>	Hearing aids are thus not available to laypersons like food or over-the-counterdrugs.  The restrictions imposed by FDA are designed to assure the safety andeffectiveness of the device for the user.  In contrast, under FDA's plan toregulate cigarettes as restricted medical devices, cigarettes would continue tobe sold over-the-counter. Furthermore, none of FDA's restrictions is justified by the Agency as makingcigarettes safe (or effective) for those who do smoke.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, in both its 1977 regulations for hearing aids and its 1980 proposedrestricted device rule, FDA interpreted Section 520(e) as applicable only todevices sold, distributed, or used by or under the supervision of a healthprofessional.  We are aware of no instance in which FDA has taken the contraryposition, until the present plan to regulate cigarettes.  The Agency, ofcourse, has the burden of explaining and justifying such a reversal inpolicy.</tt>   [44  In its proposal, however, FDAdoes not even acknowledge, let alone attempt to justify, this reversal ofpolicy.<p>	In sum, the statutory language, legislative history, and Agency precedents allconfirm that the purpose of Section520(e) is to permit FDA to limitaccess to complicated or potentially dangerous devices to health professionalsor medical settings, when it finds that laypersons (or even some healthcarepractitioners) cannot use them effectively or safely without such intervention.FDA's plan to make cigarettes "restricted devices" bears no relation to thisstatutory purpose, and thus cigarettes cannot be regulated as "restricteddevices."]<h3>2.		FDA's Proposal Does Not Satisfy Section520(e)'s</h3><tt><b>		Threshold Requirement That Restrictions Must Make</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>a Device Safe for Its Intended Users</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Section520(e) authorizes FDA to issue regulations restricting "sale,distribution, or use" of a device "if, because of its potentiality forharmful effect or the collateral measures necessary to itsuse,... there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance ofits safety and effectiveness."  21U.S.C. [[section]]360j(e)(1)(emphasis added).  The statute thus mandates that any restrictions provide"reasonable assurance of [the device's] safety and effectiveness" when it isused in compliance with the restrictions imposed.  Congress' use of theterm "otherwise" makes it absolutely clear that FDA must find that, with therestrictions it proposes, a device will be safe for use.</tt><p><tt>	Section520(e) contemplates that some devices will be safe under someconditions but not under others, and that appropriate restrictions on theirsale, distribution, or use will prevent the unsafe uses and allow safe uses.However, FDA does not assert that its planned restrictions for cigarettes willmake them safe, reasonably safe, or indeed even less unsafe, for adults whochoose to smoke, as adults are permitted to do under the proposal.  To thecontrary, FDA has found that cigarettes "are plainly not safe."  60 Fed. Reg.41,349.  The very premise of the Agency's restrictions is that the only safecigarette is one that is not smoked.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that its goal is "preventing future users from becomingaddicted to tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,349.  It goes on to claim thatits restrictions on sales to young people and on "advertising that fostersappeal and creates a demand" for cigarettes "are therefore the appropriatetools to attain the goal of reasonable assurance of safety and effectivenessfor cigarettes..., even if the goal can only be reached overone or more generations."  Id.  This claim does not satisfy thethreshold requirement of Section520(e) for three reasons.</tt><p><tt>	First, "preventing future generations from using" a device (60 Fed.Reg. 41,350) that FDA believes is unsafe for all users is not a purpose thatSection520(e) authorizes FDA to pursue.  The restricted device provisionis intended to assure that any device to which it applies is safe, as well aseffective, for patients in whose medical treatment the device isused.</tt> [45<p>	FDA's analysis does not address the safety of cigarettes for persons who willstill be permitted to obtain them.  For smokers, FDA does not contend that itsconditions will provide greater "assurance of...safety"than do present marketing arrangements.  Nor does FDA's analysis address the]<tt>effectiveness of "restricted" cigarettes.  Thus, the proposedrestrictions are not aimed at providing "reasonable assuranceof...safety and effectiveness," which is a preconditionfor invoking the authority conferred by Section520(e).</tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA cannot justify its restrictions as a means of limitingaccess to cigarettes to the population segment for whom the Agency believes theproduct is safe and effective.  FDA has made clear its determination thatcigarettes are not safe for anyone, see 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349.  Thus, thisrationale is simply inapplicable.  Furthermore, in other cases where FDA hasconcluded that a medical product should not be available for all potentialusers within the target population, e.g., because they areuniquely vulnerable to its risks, the Agency has relied on label warnings andcontraindications, rather than prohibiting sale to specified consumers.</tt>"#fn103" [46  In such instances, FDA acknowledges that,though the product may present too great a risk to some potential users, itsbenefits exceed the risk for most users.  The Agency makes no such claim withrespect to cigarettes.]Third, FDA's suggestion that the relationship between itsproposed restrictions and the ultimate "safety" of cigarettes will be manifestonly after "one or more generations" --when, it apparently hypothesizes, no one will smoke --turns the FDCA concept of safety on its head.  FDA's theory, moreover, is toospeculative to support imposition of current restrictions.  "An administrator'sdecision under a regulatory statute, such as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,must be governed by an intelligible statutory principle."  NationalNutritional Foods Ass'n v. Mathews, 557 F.2d 325, 337 (2d Cir.1977).</tt><h3>3.		Section520(e) Does Not Authorize</h3><tt>		<b>Restrictions on Advertising or Promotion</b></tt><p><tt>		</tt><p><tt>	FDA has proposed unprecedented restrictions on the advertising andpromotion of cigarettes.  These include a requirement for black-and-white,text-onlyadvertising and prohibitions on the type and location of promotional materialsand events.  Attempting to justify these restrictions, FDA asserts thatSection520(e) may be interpreted to authorize restrictions on a device's"offering for sale (including inducements to sale)."  60Fed. Reg. 41,350.This pronouncement cannot withstand analysis.</tt><p><tt>	First, FDA ignores the plain language of Section520(e).  Thatprovision authorizes only restrictions on "sale, distribution, or use"; it doesnot include the words "offer for sale."  In contrast, Congress has used thevery words "offer for sale" elsewhere in the FDCA.  See,e.g., FDCA [[section]][[section]]301(m), 301(o), 503(c);21U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]331(m), 331(o), 353(c).  The obviousinference is that Congress did not intend in Section520(e) to permitrestrictions on the "offer for sale" of a medical device.  SeeFederal Trade Comm'n v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 514-15(1963); Bott v. American Hydrocarbon Corp., 458 F.2d 229, 233(5th Cir. 1972) ("When the legislature has carefully employed a term in onesection of a statute and has excluded it in another, it should not be impliedwhere excluded").</tt><p><tt>	Second, in Section 520(e)(2) Congress granted FDA authority torequire certain statements on the label of a restricted device, but thestatute says nothing about restrictions on advertising or promotion of arestricted device.  Rather, Congress provided very specific and limitedauthority in Section502(q), prohibiting false or misleading advertising,and Section502(r), prescribing certain statements in the advertising.21U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]352(q) and (r).  If Congress hadmeant to give FDA the broad authority over advertising and promotion ofrestricted devices that the Agency now claims, the narrow and specificauthorities regarding advertising in Section502 would be superfluous.The presence of these provisions in the FDCA is evidence that FDA'sinterpretation of Section520(e) is wrong.</tt>"#fn107" [47]Third, the interpretation of Section 520(e)(1)(B) is governedand limited by the rule of ejusdem generis.  The generalreference in Section520(e)(1)(B) to "other conditions" immediatelyfollows the specific reference in Section520(e)(1)(A) to "the written ororal authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to administer or use suchdevice."  The rule of ejusdem generis "limits general terms whichfollow specific ones to matters similar to those specified."  Gooch v.United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936).  "Under the ejusdemgeneris rule of construction the general words are confined to the classand may not be used to enlarge it."  Cleveland v. United States,329 U.S. 14, 18 (1946).  See generally 2A Norman J. Singer,Sutherland on Statutory Construction [[section]]47.17 (5th ed.1992).  The rule has been applied to limit the scope of a linguisticallysimilar provision in the FDCA.  See United States v. TwoPlastic Drums..., 984 F.2d 814, 817-18(7th Cir. 1993) (relying, in part, on ejusdem generis ininterpreting the term "or otherwise" in 21 U.S.C. [[section]] 321(s)).  Therule has also been held to limit the scope of a series of statutory termsending in a term including the words "or other."  E.g.,Nevada v. Herrington, 827 F.2d 1394, 1400 (9th Cir. 1987);Sacramento Regional Cty. Sanitation Dist. v. Reilly, 905 F.2d1262, 1270 (9th Cir. 1990).</tt><p><tt>	Thus, here, ejusdem generis limits the scope of "otherconditions" authorized by Section520(e)(1)(B) to restrictions similar innature to a prescription requirement, such as a restriction to use by aphysician or nurse or to use in particular kinds of medical institutions.  Suchrestrictions specify the medical circumstances in which the device is to beused in providing medical care to a patient.  It is plainly inconsistent withthe rule of ejusdem generis to expand the scope of "otherconditions" to provisions totally dissimilar to a prescription requirement --e.g., restrictions on advertising, restrictions on promotion, orrestrictions on product names.</tt><p><tt>	Fourth, the legislative history of Section520(e) does noteven hint at the kind of sweeping authority FDA now asserts.  As originallyproposed, the House and Senate bills authorized restrictions only on the "saleor distribution" of a device.  See H.R.11124, discussedin H.R.Rep. No.853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 24-25, 76 (1976);S.510, discussed in S.Rep. No.33, 94th Cong.,1st Sess.33 (1975) (proposed Section708).  The Conference Committeesubsequently expanded the provision to authorize restrictions on "use" as well.See H.R.Conf. Rep. No.1090, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.62(1976).  DHEW supported this expansion of Section520(e) authority toinclude restrictions on use.  See DHEW Analysis of H.R. 11244, at 122Cong. Rec. 5854 (1976).  Congress carefully delineated the three types ofrestrictions-- on sale, distribution, or use-- that FDA couldimpose under Section520(e).  Accordingly, the omission of "offer forsale" language demonstrates that neither Congress nor FDA (nor FDA's parentDepartment) contemplated that Section520(e) would authorize the kind ofrestrictions on any device that FDA proposes for cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	Congress clearly knew how to confer authority on FDA to regulate theadvertising of restricted devices if it had wished to do so.  Congress,however, chose not to do so, and FDA cannot administratively overrule or amendthat decision.  See Central Bank of Denverv. FirstInterstate Bank of Denver, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 1452 (1994) ("The factthat Congress chose to impose some forms of secondary liability [in theparticular statute at issue], but not others, indicates a deliberatecongressional choice with which the courts should not interfere.");Curtisv. United States, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 1736 (1994)("The language [in one provision of the federal criminal code] shows that whenCongress intended to authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions at thetime of sentencing, it knew how to do so.  Congress' omission of similarlanguage in [another section] indicates that it did not intend to givedefendants [that right].").</tt><p><tt>	FDA's new, self-aggrandizinginterpretation of Section520(e) also contradicts the interpretation itoffered in imposing restrictions on hearing aids.  There, FDA recognized thatSection502(r) of the FDCA gave it authority to regulate certain aspectsof the advertising of hearing aids.  The Agency acknowledged, however, that itsauthority is limited to the specific information listed in Section502(r),and that in all other respects the FTC retained jurisdiction over advertisingfor a restricted device.  As FDA stated:</tt><p><tt>"Section502(r) gives FDA jurisdiction for regulating certainspecified advertising of restricted devices, and the section concurrentlyremoves FTC authority to apply the sanctions of court injunction or criminalpenalties under sections12 through 15 of the Federal Trade Commission Actto prevent these acts.  . . .  Moreover, section502(r) does not extendto, or in any way limit, any other authority of FTC related to the regulationof the sale of devices, such as the authority provided to FTC undersection5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15U.S.C. 45) toprevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices."</tt><p><p><tt>42 Fed. Reg. 9286 (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	As FDA's preamble to the hearing aid regulation acknowledges,Section520(e) does not grant FDA any authority to regulate theadvertising of restricted devices, and Section502 only authorizes FDA toprohibit false or misleading advertising and to require the inclusion inadvertising of the items of information specified inSection502(r)-- specifically, (1)the device name, (2)abrief statement of the intended uses and relevant warnings, and (3),ifdetermined necessary after a hearing, a description of the device's components.21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(r).  None of these provisions gives FDAauthority to dictate the style or color or use of images in advertising of arestricted device, or to restrict the places where such advertising mayappear.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, there is no support for FDA's view that it can broadly regulateadvertising as an "implied" authority under the restricted device provision.FDA did not even put forward a plausible argument, let alone the compellingjustification that would be required to impose advertising controls that wouldimpinge on the First Amendment and on the clear authority of the FTC toregulate cigarette advertising.  See Volumes VII-IX of thesecomments.</tt><h3>4.		Section520(e) Restrictions May Not Extend</h3><tt><b>		to Matters Ancillary to Sale, Distribution,</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>or Use of the Physical Device Itself       </b></tt><p><tt>		</tt><p><tt>	FDA has announced a broad array of restrictions on cigarette promotion,including a ban on hats and tee-shirts bearing cigarette brand names,restrictions on the sponsorship of athletic, artistic and cultural events, andeven a mandatory industry-fundededucational program.  Not one of these can be justified as a restriction on the"sale, distribution, or use" of a device, as authorized bySection520(e)(1).</tt><p><tt>	First, as discussed above, FDA's assertion that Section520(e)authorizes restrictions on the "offering for sale" of a device is contrary tothe statutory language and legislative history.  Section520(e) doesnot authorize such restrictions.</tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA's previous interpretation was that Section520(e)only authorizes restrictions on the restricted device itself, and does notempower the Agency to regulate promotional matters ancillary to the device'smarketing and use.  In regulating hearing aids as restricted devices, FDAacknowledged that its "labeling regulations and restrictions on the sale ofhearing aids are only a partial solution to the problems in the hearing aidhealth care delivery system."  42Fed. Reg. 9286, 9287 (Feb.15,1977).  FDA then continued:  "The Commissioner notes, however, that the [FDCA]regulates the safety, effectiveness, and labeling of the hearing aiditself."  Id. (emphasis added).  For this reason, FDA concluded thatit could not prescribe competency standards for hearing health professionals(which were left to State licensing law); fix the price of hearing aids; orcontrol the promotional practices of hearing aid dispensers (which were left tothe FTC, e.g., in regulating trial-rentalperiods, purchase-optionplans, and "excessive and abusive sales practices").  See id. at9286, 9287.</tt> [48  <p>	In sum, for hearing aids, FDA correctly determined that underSection520(e) it could regulate only the sale and labeling of therestricted device itself.  Other practices were left to State law and to theFTC's general authority to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices underSection5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15U.S.C.[[section]]45.  ]<tt>See 42 Fed. Reg. 9286.</tt>"#fn125" [49<p>	The same understanding of Section520(e) would have to apply tocigarettes, even if cigarettes could be regulated as medical devices.  FDA maynot regulate attire, contests, athletic or cultural events, or the price ofcigarettes (]<tt>e.g., by mandating a minimum package size).These matters are not related to the "safety, effectiveness, and labeling ofthe [product] itself."  See 42 Fed. Reg. 9287.</tt><p><tt>	FDA may not invent authority that the FDCA does not confer simply becausethe Agency believes it would be good public policy.  The courts have rejectedprevious FDA efforts to impose restrictions on products to achieve policyobjectives for which clear statutory authority was lacking.  For example, whenFDA tried to restrict the channels of distribution of the drug methadone, thecourt concluded that FDA's well-intentionedprogram nonetheless exceeded its authority:</tt><p><tt>"It is undoubtedly true that methadone poses unique problems of medicaljudgment, law enforcement and public policy but this fact alone cannot justifya federal agency of specifically delimited jurisdiction from implementingequally unique control solutions not authorized by Congress."</tt><p><p><tt>	*        *        *</tt><p><p><tt>"Under these circumstances, the relative merits of FDA's plan to controlthe distribution of methadone, a controlled substance, must first be passedupon by Congress."</tt><p><p><tt>American Pharmaceutical Ass'n v.

This admonition applies forcefully to FDA's characterization ofcigarettes as restricted medical "devices."</tt><h3>5.		FDA's Decision To Regulate Cigarettes as</h3><tt><b>		Medical "Devices" Produces Untenable</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Conflicts with Other Statutory Provisions</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>		</tt><p><tt>	In 1980, FDA forthrightly acknowledged that the FDCA does not confer"authorities suitable to the regulation of cigarettes," from which fact itcorrectly inferred that it lacked jurisdiction over cigarettes.  SeePartB.1, supra.  FDA's decision, now, to regulate cigarettes asmedical "devices" is an attempt to force a square peg into a round hole.  Thecontortions and distortions that the Agency must go through in this exerciseprovide perhaps the clearest evidence-- as if any more were needed--that it has no legal authority to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices," oron any other basis.  </tt><p><tt>	To construct the program FDA considers appropriate, the Agency (1) createsconflicts with other statutes; (2) disregards mandatory provisions of the FDCA;and (3) produces a regulatory scheme never considered, much less authorized, byCongress.</tt><h4>a.		Conflicts with Other Statutes</h4><h5>(i)		Conflict with FCLAA Provision</h5><tt>				<b>Relating to Cigarette Labels </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA recognizes that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act,15U.S.C. [[section]]1334(a), preempts it from requiring anyadditional information on cigarette package labels.  "The proposed rule takesinto account the Federal preemption provision of the [FCLAA] and is consistentwith this statutory prohibition."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,352.  FDA apparentlybelieves that consistency can be achieved if it exempts cigarette packagelabels from all the requirements and restrictions that it proposes with respectto cigarette labeling and advertising.  Proposed 21C.F.R.[[section]]897.30(a); but see proposed 21C.F.R.[[section]]897.24 ("Established Names").  In its zeal to assertjurisdiction over cigarettes, however, FDA has ignored the workings of its ownstatute, the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	Cigarettes are marketed over-the-counter,and this is one of the few things FDA has no plans to change.  Four importantprovisions of the FDCA apply to the labeling of "drugs" and "devices" sold over-the-counter(OTC).</tt><p><tt>	First, Section502(f)(1) requires that the labeling of a"drug" or "device" bear "adequate directions for use."  21U.S.C.[[section]]352(f)(1).  The term "adequate directions for use" means"directions under which the layman can use a device safely and for the purposesfor which it is intended."  21C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]201.5,801.5.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, Section502(f)(2) requires that labeling bear "suchadequate warnings... against unsafe dosage or methods orduration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as arenecessary for the protection of users."  21U.S.C.[[section]]352(f)(2).  "[A]dequate warnings" are ones that, in thecircumstances, make a product safe.  </tt><p><tt>	Third, Section502(c) provides that all information requiredto appear on the label or labeling of an article must be "prominently placedthereon with such conspicuousness... and in such terms as torender it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual undercustomary conditions of purchase and use."  Id.[[section]]352(c).</tt><p><tt>	Fourth, a "drug" or "device" that violates any of the foregoingrequirements is "misbranded" under Section502 and is prohibited fromentering commerce.  FDCA [[section]]301(a), 21U.S.C.[[section]]331(a).</tt><p><tt>	In light of Section502(c), "adequate directions for use" and"adequate warnings" for an OTC device must be physically part of, or attachedto, the product package so that they will reach the consumer.</tt>"#fn125" [50  If adequate directions for safe use and/or"adequate warnings... necessary for the protection of users"cannot be provided on the device's label-- whether by reason of anotherstatute or, in FDA's view, the complexity of the scientific facts-- theFDCA does not permit that device to be marketed over-the-counter.<p>	If cigarettes are medical "devices"-- as FDA claims-- therequirements of adequate directions for use and adequate warnings apply.  Theabsence of such directions or warnings would make cigarettes unlawfulmisbranded products, banned from commerce.51 <p>	Section502(f) does not authorize any exemption from the requirement inSection502(f)(2) of adequate warnings.  Given its conclusions regardingthe health effects of cigarettes, FDA is necessarily of the view that thecongressionally prescribed warnings that now appear on cigarette packages areinadequate "for the protection of users"-- ]<tt>i.e.,that they do not make cigarettes safe for those who use them.  If FDA viewedthese warnings as adequate, it could not, and presumably would not,characterize cigarettes as "plainly not safe," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349; it wouldnot ascribe to cigarettes the current health effects discussed in the preamble,id. at 41,318-19; and its entire regulatory program would beunnecessary.</tt><p><tt>	Therefore, given the Agency's view that cigarettes are "plainly not safe"and that the current warnings on packages are inadequate "for the protection ofusers," there is an inescapable conflict between the FCLAA's prohibitionagainst any additional required warnings on cigarette packages and FDCA[[section]]502(f)(2)'s requirement of "adequate warnings ...for the protection of users."  </tt><p><tt>	A similar conflict exists with respect to the FDCA's requirement foradequate directions for use.  Given FDA's view of the health effects ofcigarettes, none of the current regulatory exemptions provided by 21 C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]801.109- 801.127 fromSection502(f)(1)'s requirement of adequate directions for use wouldapply.</tt> [52<p>	Section502(f) authorizes FDA, by regulation, to exempt medical devices(and drugs) from the requirement of adequate directions for use "where [suchrequirement]... is not necessary for the protection of thepublic health."  The plain meaning of that standard ("not necessary for theprotection of the public health") is that, in actual use, the product will besafe and the public health will be otherwise protected (because,]<tt>e.g., the product will be used only on the prescriptionof a physician).</tt> [53  Given FDA's view ofthe health effects of cigarettes, that standard could not be met.  It isinconceivable that Congress in Section502(f) authorized FDA to exempt aproduct from adequate directions for use because FDA was of the view thatadequate directions for safe use of the product could never be written.<p>	FDA may not rely on Section520(a) to exempt cigarettes from therequirement of adequate warnings and adequate directions for use.  FDA maywaive requirements of Section502 only by action under Sections513,514, 515, or 520(g)-- action that FDA has not proposed, much lesstaken-- and, given its views, could not take.  ]<tt>SeePartB.3.a, supra.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, given FDA's view of cigarettes, the only way, consistent withSections502(f)(1) and (2), that it could assert jurisdiction overcigarettes as medical "devices" and allow them to continue to be marketed wouldbe by requiring on or in cigarette packages additional information relating tosmoking and health sufficient, in FDA's view, to enable a layperson to use theproduct safely.  Any such information, even if it could be drafted, would beprecluded by the FCLAA.  15U.S.C. [[section]]1334(a).</tt><p><tt>	There is a more general objection to FDA's proposals.  Under the FDCA, FDAhas virtually plenary authority over device labels.  See FDCA[[section]]502, 21U.S.C. [[section]]352; 21C.F.R. Part801.  Indeed, the Agency's authority over labels is among its most importantauthorities with respect to medical devices.  FDA's admitted lack of authorityto regulate cigarette package labels to bring them into compliance withSections502(f)(1), (f)(2), and 502(c) exposes the conflict between itsclaim that cigarettes are medical "devices" and the clear language of theFCLAA.  This basic conflict confirms that Congress has not given FDA authorityto regulate cigarettes as medical "devices."</tt><h5>(ii)		Conflict with FCLAA Provision</h5><tt><b>				for Confidentiality of Cigarette</b></tt><p><tt><b>Ingredients&nbp;</b></tt><p><p><tt><b>				</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA acknowledges a conflict between FDCA [[section]]502(r)(2)and 15U.S.C. [[section]]1335a.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,338-39.  WhereasSection502(r)(2) authorizes FDA to require disclosure to consumers ofcomponents and ingredients of devices regulated under Section520(e), theFCLAA in Section1335a(a)(2)(A) requires that such information bedisclosed to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and that it bekept confidential.  Thus, even if FDA properly invoked Section520(e), itcould not exercise an authority Congress intended it to have for every deviceregulated under Section520(e).  This conflict is further evidence thatCongress did not intend FDA to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices."</tt><h4>b.		Disregard of Mandatory </h4><tt>			<b>Provisions of the FDCA</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Although FDA proposes to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices," it hasapparently decided to exempt cigarettes from many FDCA provisions that Congressmandated FDA to apply to "devices" generally.  FDA never discusses whythese sections need not apply, and even fails to acknowledge the existence ofsome of them.  The fact is that, if FDA applied these provisions, it would haveto ban cigarettes.  It is to avoid total prohibition that FDA presumably findsthese provisions unsuitable-- and inconvenient-- to discuss.  Oncemore, FDA's implicit acknowledgment that it lacks "suitable" tools</tt>"#fn138" [54 confirms that Congress has not given theAgency authority to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices."  ]<h5>(i)	  Device Classification</h5><tt>	Classification of a medical "device" is the "keystone" of the MedicalDevice Amendments of 1976;</tt> [55 the entiremodern structure of medical device regulation rests on it.<p>	Section 513(b)(1) of the FDCA, 21U.S.C. [[section]]360c(b)(1)(emphasis added), provides:<p>"For purposes of--<p><p>(A)	determining which devices intended for human use should be subject to therequirements of general controls, performance standards, or premarket approval,and<p><p>(B)	providing notice to the manufacturers and importers of such devices toenable them to prepare for the application of such requirements to devicesmanufactured or imported by them, <p><p>the Secretary ]<tt>shall classify all such devices (other thandevices classified by subsection(f)) into the classes established bysubsection(a)...."</tt>"#fn141" [56<p><p>Thus, FDA is legally obligated to classify a device.57  Yet, without  anydiscussion, the Agency bypasses the classification of cigarettes.58<p>	FDA's reasons for ignoring the statute's mandate are transparent andillegitimate.  Congress created three classes of medical devices.  ClassIis for a device "for which the controls authorized by or under [severalprovisions of the FDCA] are sufficient to provide reasonable assuranceof... safety and effectiveness...," and fora device that "does not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness orinjury."  FDCA [[section]]513(a)(1)(A), 21U.S.C.[[section]]360c(a)(1)(A).  Given the Agency's view that "tobacco productsare plainly not safe," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349 (]<tt>see alsoid. at 41,318-19), and cannot be made safe, id. at 41,352 n.6,cigarettes could not be classified into classI.</tt><p><tt>	ClassII is for a device "which cannot be classified as aclassI device because the general controls by themselves are insufficientto provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device,and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls toprovide such assurance."  FDCA [[section]] 513(a)(1)(B), 21U.S.C.[[section]]360c(a)(1)(B) (Supp. 1993).  Again, given FDA's view of thehealth effects of cigarettes, it could not classify cigarettes intoclassII.</tt><p><tt>	The remaining class is classIII.  Section513(a)provides:</tt><p><tt>"A device which because--</tt><p><p><tt>	"(i)  it (I)cannot be classified as a classI device becauseinsufficient information exists to determine that the application of generalcontrols are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of the device, and (II)cannot be classified as aclassII device because insufficient information exists to determine thatthe special controls described in subparagraph(B) would providereasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, and</tt><p><p><tt>	"(ii)-- (I)is purported or represented to be for a use insupporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantialimportance in preventing impairment of human health, or (II)presents apotential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,</tt><p><p><tt>	"is to be subject, in accordance with section515, to premarketapproval to provide reasonable assurance of its safety andeffectiveness."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360c(a)(1)(C) (West 1988 &amp; Supp. 1993).Section513(f)(1) further provides:</tt><p><tt>"Any device intended for human use which was not introduced or deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution beforeMay28, 1976 is classified in classIII unless--</tt><p><p><tt>	"(A)  the device--</tt><p><p><tt>		"(i)  is within a type of device (I)which was introduced ordelivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distributionbefore such date and which is to be classified pursuant to subsection(b)of this section, or (II)which was not so introduced or delivered beforesuch date and has been classified in classI or II, and</tt><p><p><tt>		"(ii)  is substantially equivalent to another device within such type,or</tt><p><p><tt>	"(B)  the Secretary in response to a petition submitted underparagraph(2) has classified such device in classI or II."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360c(f)(1).  </tt><p><tt>	Thus, cigarettes-- if they could be regulated as medicaldevices-- would automatically be classIII devices underSection513(f)(1).</tt> [59  If somehowSection513(f)(1) did not apply, FDA would have to classify cigarettesinto classIII because, on FDA's view of their health effects, cigarettesfit the criteria of Section513(a)(1)(C)(i) and (ii)(II).<p>	The result of classifying cigarettes into classIII, as the text ofSection513(a)(1)(C) makes explicit, is that they would be"subject... to premarket approval to provide reasonableassurance of...safety...."  21U.S.C. [[section]]360c(a)(1)(C).  Given FDA's view of the health effectsof cigarettes, there are no circumstances under which such assurance could beprovided.  Cigarettes-- all cigarettes-- would therefore have to bebanned.<p>	Thus, as FDA surely recognizes, if it adhered to the statute's mandate andclassified cigarettes, it would then have to ban them given its view of theirhealth effects.  However, FDA has no authority to exempt a device fromclassification.  FDA's recognition that it cannot comply with this mandatorystatutory provision is further evidence that Congress has not given the Agencyauthority to regulate cigarettes as medical "devices." ]<h5>(ii)	  Premarket Review</h5><tt>	With exceptions not here relevant, classIII devices must have apremarket approval from FDA before they are marketed.  FDCA[[section]]515(a), 21U.S.C. [[section]]360e(a).</tt>"#fn156" [60  Again, FDA is simply disregarding thisrequirement for cigarettes and claiming that it will instead use otherauthorities.  Undoubtedly FDA is taking this position because, given its viewof the health effects of cigarettes, the Agency believes that cigarettes couldnot satisfy the requirements for premarket approval and therefore could notlawfully be marketed.  <p>	FDA's arguments that it has authority to waive premarket approval arespecious.  The Agency's principal argument is that:<p>"While premarket approval of a device has generally been regarded as theregulatory control that provides the greatest assurance of safety andeffectiveness, on occasion the agency has chosen not to use premarket approvalfor critical devices that potentially raise significant safety and efficacyissues.  For example, the agency has announced that it will no longer enforcepremarket approval requirements for heart valve allografts.  See the FederalRegister of October14, 1994 (59 FR 52078).  FDA took this action afterconcluding that other regulatory controls would be more appropriate thanpremarket approval to provide reasonable assurance of the safety andeffectiveness of these products.  See also ]<tt>Hecklerv.Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985) (upholding agency's decision not to enforcepremarket approval requirements for use of prescription drugs for lethalinjection)."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,349.  </tt><p><tt>	This argument, however, takes no account of Congress' mandatory languagein Section515.  It also relies on precedents that bear no relevance tothis proceeding.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's decision to abandon its demand for premarket approval of heart valveallografts, 59 Fed. Reg. 52,078, 52,079 (Oct. 14, 1994), provides no supportfor FDA's decision not to require premarket review of cigarettes (or for anyother aspect of FDA's regulatory scheme for cigarettes).  FDA originallydeclared that heart valve allografts had been classified into classIII, aclassification that would have triggered a requirement for premarketapproval.</tt>"#fn156" [61  Later, after a courtsetback,62 the Agency entered into a settlement in which it agreed to classifythese devices into classII, for which premarket approval is not required.Thus, FDA's suspension of its decision to require approval for allograft valveswas a judicially sanctioned, temporary step pending downclassification.Furthermore, in announcing the settlement, FDA emphasized that heart valveallografts "remain subject to ]<tt>all other requirements applicableto medical devices."  59 Fed. Reg. 52,079 (emphasis added).  </tt><p><tt>	FDA has announced no plans to classify cigarettes intoclassII-- or indeed any class at all-- and it has not madethem "subject to all other requirements applicable to medical devices."  Inobvious defiance of the statute, FDA apparently intends to leave cigarettesunclassified and to exempt them from premarket review indefinitely.  FDA hasnever taken such a position with respect to any genuine medicaldevice.  </tt><p><tt>	The Agency's resort to Hecklerv. Chaney iscalculatedly misleading.  No issue of premarket approval (or "enforcement" of apremarket approval requirement) was presented by the facts, decided, or evenmentioned by the Supreme Court.  There was no applicable "premarket approvalrequirement" that was being violated or ignored, and none was referred to inthe Court's opinion.  The fact that the drugs involved were being used for apurpose FDA had not approved (i.e., for lethal injection) did notpresent an issue of FDA's authority to require or waive premarket approval.The only question before FDA was whether to take enforcement action to stop theuse of the drugs for that purpose.</tt>"#fn158" [63The only issue before the Court was whether FDA's decision not to takeenforcement action was judicially reviewable.  470 U.S. at821, 837-38;]<tt>see Part B.3.d, supra.</tt><p><tt>	FDA also argues that, under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 and theSafe Medical Devices Act of 1990, it has broad discretion to dispense withstatutory mandates, including premarket review, and to use whatever regulatorycontrols it chooses.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,349.  For the reasons stated in PartB.3.a, supra, this astonishing assertion is baseless.  Although Congresscalibrated mandatory controls to the risks associated with each class ofdevice, it did not empower FDA to disregard or revise the statutoryscheme.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, Congress intended that all classIII devices be subjected topremarket review, so that unsafe devices would not reach or remain on themarket.  FDA's recognition that premarket review is inappropriate forcigarettes is an admission that cigarettes may not lawfully be regulated asmedical "devices."</tt><h5>(iii)		Adequate Warnings for Protection of </h5><tt>					<b>Users and Adequate Directions for Use</b></tt><p><p><tt><b>					</b></tt><p><tt>	Adequate warnings for protection of users and, with limitedexceptions not relevant here, adequate directions for use (i.e.,directions for use sufficient to enable a layperson to use a device safely) arestatutorily mandated for devices.  See Part C.5.a, supra.  Inview of the FCLAA's requirements and given FDA's position on the health effectsof cigarettes, adequate warnings for protection of users and adequatedirections for use cannot, in FDA's view, be written for cigarettes.  FDA'sfailure to apply these requirements to cigarettes demonstrates that FDA'smedical "device" jurisdiction does not extend to cigarettes.</tt><h5>(iv)	  Reports by Manufacturers</h5><tt>	Section 519(a) of the FDCA directs FDA to issue regulations requiringmanufacturers of medical devices to report certain types of adverse events toFDA.  21U.S.C. [[section]]360i(a).  (Those regulations for medicaldevice reporting (MDR) appear at 21C.F.R. Part803.)  FDA, however,has proposed to exempt cigarette manufacturers from this statutoryobligation</tt><p><tt>"because the adverse health effects attributable tocigarettes... are extensive and well-documented, and theagency sees little benefit in requiring manufacturers and distributors of theseproducts to report such information to FDA."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,342.  </tt><p><tt>	The Agency cites no authority to exempt manufacturers ofcigarettes-- even if they were medical devices-- from the statutoryrequirement for medical device reporting.  Section519(c) authorizes FDAto issue a regulation to exempt classes of persons from MDR reportingrequirements where the Agency finds that such reporting "is not necessary to(A)assure that a device is not adulterated or misbranded or(B)otherwise to assure its safety and effectiveness."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]360i(c).  Given FDA's view that cigarettes "are plainly notsafe," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349, and its proposal to require additional healthwarnings for cigarettes, see proposed 21 C.F.R.[[section]]897.32(c) and 60 Fed. Reg. 41,338, the Agency's exemption forcigarette manufacturers cannot be reconciled with Section519(c).Furthermore, this would be the first time FDA had concluded that manufacturersof a "device" should be completely exempted from the Section519(a)reporting requirement.  </tt><p><tt>	Perhaps FDA should be congratulated for recognizing that this provision ofthe FDCA, which applies to all genuine medical devices, is not, to use its ownprior word, "suitable" for cigarettes.</tt>"#fn159" [64But the Agency ignores the proper inference to be drawn from this fact:Congress never intended that cigarettes should be regulated by FDA, much lessregulated as medical devices.]<h5>(v)	  Postmarket Surveillance</h5><tt>	Section522(a)(1) of the FDCA provides:  </tt><p><tt>"The Secretary shall require a manufacturer to conductpostmarket surveillance for any device of the manufacturer first introduced ordelivered for introduction into interstate commerce after January1, 1991,that--</tt><p><p><tt>	*       *       *</tt><p><p><tt>	(C)  potentially presents a serious risk to human health."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360l(a)(1) (emphasis added).  </tt><p><tt>	This provision, too, is mandatory and applicable to all medical devicesthat fit its terms.  FDA does not, however, plan to impose this requirement oncigarette manufacturers.  Presumably, the Agency's reasons are the same as itsreasons for not requiring reporting of adverse events, although it does notbother to mention, much less explain, its "waiver" of this requirement.Section522(a) is therefore another statutory requirement for medicaldevices that obviously is not suitable for cigarettes.</tt><h5>(vi)	  Device User Facility Reports</h5><tt>	FDCA [[section]]519(b)(1)(A) provides:</tt><p><tt>"Whenever a device user facility receives or otherwise becomes aware ofinformation that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused orcontributed to the death of a patient of the facility, the facility shall, assoon as practicable but not later than 10 working days after becoming aware ofthe information, report the information to the Secretary...."</tt>"#fn159" [65<p><p>21U.S.C. [[section]]360i(b)(1)(A).  The term "device user facility"means "a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, or outpatienttreatment facility which is not a physician's office."  FDCA[[section]]519(b)(5), 21U.S.C. [[section]]360i(b)(5).  FDAmay also expand the definition to include "an outpatient diagnostic facilitywhich is not a physician's office."  ]<tt>Id.</tt><p><tt>	FDA does not propose to require such user facility reports for cigarettes.FDA must recognize that Section519(b) is one more statutory mandate,applicable to devices generally, that is not "suitable" for cigarettes.</tt><h5>(vii)	  "Dangerous" Devices Are Misbranded</h5><tt>	FDCA [[section]]502(j) provides that a drug or device is misbranded(and therefore may not be lawfully marketed)</tt><p><tt>"[i]f it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or withthe frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labelingthereof."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]352(j).  FDA has said thatSection502(j) covers drugs </tt><p><tt>"whose toxic potentialities are such that they should not be used evenunder a physician's supervision....  The philosophybehind our position with respect to this class of drugs is that theirtherapeutic usefulness is either totally lacking or so minor in comparison tothe great harm which they are capable of causing that informed physicians wouldunder no circumstances employ these drugs.  In our opinion, no form of labelingcan be devised for these articles which will remove this danger.  Hence, anysale or the proffer for sale of these drugs under any labeling which offersthem for drug use automatically misbrands them."</tt><p><p><tt>FDA Trade Correspondence, TC-389 (Aug.6, 1942), A Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act Judicial Record 1938-1964 727 (FDLI;WeitzmanS.A., Murphy E.G., Mark N. eds. 1978).  This same reasoning isapplicable to medical devices within the scope of Section502(j).</tt><p><tt>	Plainly, Congress intended that a medical "device" that displays thecharacteristics described in Section502(j) should not be marketed.Equally plainly, FDA believes that cigarettes have those characteristics.  60Fed. Reg. 41,318-19.  Yet FDA plans to permit cigarette marketing to continueand altogether ignore this provision.</tt><p><tt>	Congress itself concluded that cigarettes should be officially labeled as"dangerous to... health."  The 1969 amendments to the FCLAArequired a new Surgeon General's warning:</tt><p><tt>"Warning:  The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking IsDangerous to Your Health."</tt><p><p><tt>Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub.L. No.91-222,[[section]]4, 84 Stat. 87, 88 (1970) (amending FCLAASection4).</tt>"#fn159" [66  Yet Congressundeniably intended that marketing of cigarettes should remain lawful.Congress never intended that cigarettes should be regulated under the FDCA andbe subject to banning under Section502(j).  <p>	Section502(j) does not permit FDA to take into account the kinds offactors that led Congress in 1969 (and since) to allow cigarettes to continueto be marketed.  ]<tt>See 15U.S.C. [[section]]1331(2)(protection of commerce and the national economy); Comprehensive SmokingEducation Act of 1984, Pub.L. No.98-474, Section2, 98 Stat.2200 (1984) ("to enable individuals to make informed decisions about smoking").FDA knows this, but it fails to draw the obvious inference from this conflictbetween the FDCA and congressional policy:  Congress did not intend cigarettesto be regulated by FDA as medical "devices"-- or, indeed, at all. </tt><h5>(viii)	  Mandatory Recall</h5><tt>	FDCA [[section]]518(e)(1) provides:</tt><p><tt>"If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that adevice intended for human use would cause serious, adverse health consequencesor death, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring the appropriateperson (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers ofthe device)--</tt><p><p><tt>	(A) to immediately cease distribution of such device, and</tt><p><p><tt>	(B) to immediately notify health professionals and device user facilitiesof the order and to instruct such professionals and facilities to cease use ofsuch device."</tt><p><p><tt>21U.S.C. [[section]]360h(e)(1) (emphasis added).  If FDA makesthe requisite finding-- "serious, adverse health consequences ordeath"-- with respect to a device, it must order an immediate cessationof distribution under Section518(e)(1).  Based on the same finding, andafter an opportunity for an administrative hearing, FDA may direct that already-distributedunits of the product be recalled.  FDA has already made the requisitefinding with respect to cigarettes, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,318-19, 41,349, 41,352 n.6,but the Agency nevertheless plans to disregard Section518(e)(1)'srequirements. </tt><p><tt>	There is a related statutory provision applicable to all medical devicesthat also is not "suitable" for cigarettes.  FDA's finding of "serious, adversehealth consequences or death" would also trigger the statutory requirement fortemporary suspension of a device's approved premarket approval application(PMA) under FDCA [[section]]515(e)(3), 21 U.S.C.[[section]]360e(e)(3).  This is further evidence of congressional intentthat premarket approval requirements would apply to devices with the healtheffects that FDA ascribes to cigarettes.  Yet FDA has chosen to ignore that"unsuitable" congressional mandate.</tt><p><tt>	That Section518(e) does not suit cigarettes is reinforced bySection518(e)(1)(B).  Congress plainly contemplated that the kinds ofdevices as to which the finding required by Section518(e)(1) would bemade would be devices used by health professionals.  See 21U.S.C.[[section]]360h(e)(l)(B) (FDA's order shall require manufacturers "toimmediately notify health professionals").  Congress never contemplated thatFDA would have occasion to make such a finding with respect to cigarettes, aproduct smokers use without intervention by health professionals.  </tt><h4>c.		FDA Has Created a Regulatory Scheme</h4><tt>			<b>Never Authorized byCongress</b></tt><p><p><tt>	The foregoing conflicts and discrepancies between FDA's proposals forcigarettes and the FDCA's requirements for genuine medical devices, when takentogether, convey a single unmistakable message:  FDA has asserted jurisdictionover, but is leaving on the market for the indefinite future under its ongoingsupervision, a product that, the Agency says, is "plainly not safe," 60 Fed.Reg. 41,349; cannot be made safe, id. at 41,352 n.6; and causes 400,000deaths a year, id. at 41,318.  FDA has chosen to regulate a class ofproducts it considers deadly, with a set of tools Congress designed forproducts-- genuine medical devices-- marketed to support andimprove health.</tt><p><tt>	The notion that Congress intended to allow FDA to assert jurisdiction oversuch a product, while allowing its marketing to continue, flies in the face ofnumerous provisions of the FDCA.  The authorities conveyed in the MedicalDevice Amendments of 1976 were granted "to assure the safety and effectivenessof medical devices intended for human use."  H.R.Rep. No.853, 94thCong., 2d Sess.3 (1976).  The House Committee that reported the billcharacterized it as "intended to assure that the public is protected fromunsafe and ineffective medical devices...."  Id.at 12.</tt>"#fn159" [67  Given the view of smoking thatCongress had already reflected in the Surgeon General's warning as amended in1970, and given FDA's current view on the health effects of smoking, it issimply preposterous for FDA to consider cigarettes medical "devices" for whichit can or will assure safe or effective use. <p>	Every one of the mandatory provisions that FDA is disregarding--classification, premarket review, adequate warnings, adequate directions foruse, postmarket surveillance, reports by manufacturers, user facility reports,dangerous devices, recall-- is intended to make medical devices safe.FDA disregards them, usually without explanation, because it wants to assertjurisdiction over, but leave on the market, a product that the Agency considersinevitably, unavoidably, and irremediably unsafe.68<p>	To achieve its objective of regulating but leaving on the market a product itconsiders unsafe, FDA has to stand the FDCA on its head and ignore or distortits provisions beyond recognition.  To keep on the market a product it hasdeclared unsafe, FDA has to construct, out of statutory provisions]<tt>intended by Congress for precisely the opposite purpose, a newregulatory scheme never contemplated, much less authorized by Congress.</tt><p><tt>	The crowning irony is that FDA does not say, or apparently believe, thatits proposed regulatory scheme will make any cigarette safe.  Nowhere in thehundreds of pages it has published in the Federal Register does FDAassert that cigarettes will, as a result of FDA regulation, become safe, moresafe, or more nearly safe for those who use them.  Nothing in the FDCA or itslegislative history remotely suggests that Congress ever intended FDA to createor operate such a bizarre regulatory scheme.</tt><p><H3><a href=vol6.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

We also showthat FDA has miscalculated the practical and economic impact of its proposedrules, overestimating the benefits and underestimating the costs.</tt><p><tt>	In furnishing these comments on the particular regulations proposed byFDA, we do not concede that the Agency has any authority to regulatecigarettes.  It does not.</tt><p><tt><b>	COMMENTS ON FDA'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS:</b></tt><p><tt><b>	PART 897</b></tt><p><tt><b>	            GENERAL COMMENTS           </b></tt><p><p><p><tt>	The cigarette manufacturers have actively supported, and will continueactively to support, appropriate efforts in the States to restrict youth accessto cigarettes.  Just last month, the nation's largest retailer and wholesalerassociations --with backing from the tobacco industry --announced the launch of their most ambitious effort to date to promotecompliance with State minimum sales-agelaws.  The program, which is expected to reach 300,000 retailers within thenext few months, will provide training and educational materials to retailersto prevent the sale of tobacco products to under-age customers.</tt>"#fn0" [1  This new initiative builds on previous effortson the part of the tobacco industry to keep tobacco out of the hands of youngpeople and to discourage youth smoking.2<p>	FDA's proposed rules, by contrast, would have little effect on tobacco use byyoung people.  They are beyond the Agency's statutory authority; areunjustified as a matter of policy; and would violate the Constitution.  Beforewe proceed to a detailed discussion of these points, however, a few generalobservations are in order.  Each of these observations is developed in detailin the course of these comments.]First, FDA insists that its proposed restrictions on sale anddistribution are intended to reduce tobacco use among young people.  Asdiscussed in our comments on SubpartB, however, the principal effect ofthese restrictions would be to make it significantly more difficult forretailers to sell cigarettes to adults, and significantly more difficultfor adults to purchase cigarettes.  At the same time, the proposedrestrictions ignore the central issue in reducing underage tobacco use:enforcement of existing state laws prohibiting the sale and distribution oftobacco products to minors.</tt><p><tt>	This issue was recognized as central by Congress in the ADAMHAReorganization Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-321,106 Stat. 323, 394 (1992).  In that legislation, Congress exercised its powerof the purse to promote more vigorous enforcement of State laws prohibiting thesale and distribution of tobacco products to minors.  Unaccountably, theDepartment of Health and Human Services ("HHS") has yet to complete arulemaking commenced over two years ago by the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration ("SAMHSA") to implement that legislation.See 58 Fed. Reg. 45,156 (Aug.26, 1993) (NPRM).  Rather thanimplement the ADAMHA legislation, HHS (through FDA) has now proposed sweepingand unprecedented controls, never approved by Congress, whose effect on tobaccouse by young people would be marginal at best, but whose impact on industry andadult smokers would be severe.  </tt><p><tt>	Congress' enactment of the ADAMHA legislation and its carefully craftedapproach to youth access demonstrates that FDA has no authority under the FDCAto establish its own regulatory program to address that same issue.  FDA'sproposed rules regarding sale and distribution thus are precluded by the ADAMHAstatute.</tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA insists that its advertising and labeling restric-tionsare intended to shield young people from the "attractive imagery" thatsupposedly influences or predisposes them to smoke.  However, as discussed inour comments on Subpart D, the principal effect of these restrictions would beto make it more difficult, and perhaps impossible, for cigarette manufacturersto advertise and promote their products to adults.  In so doing, FDAwould nullify the "comprehensive Federal program" established by Congress inthe Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act ("FCLAA").  See 15U.S.C. [[section]]1331 et seq.  The Agency's proposed rulesregarding cigarette advertising, promotion, and labeling are precluded byFCLAA.  At the same time, FDA has not demonstrated (and cannot demonstrate), asrequired by the Supreme Court's First Amendment decisions, that these proposedrules "will in fact" reduce tobacco use among persons under the age of18,</tt>"#fn4" [3 or even that these rules are likelyto have that effect.<p>	The fundamental premise of FDA's proposed rules-- that traditional formsof tobacco advertising and promotion influence or predispose young people touse tobacco-- is incorrect.  There is no convincing evidence that FDA'srestrictions, virtually all of which have been specifically rejected byCongress, are likely to reduce tobacco use by young people.  Those restrictionson advertising, promotion and labeling would violate the First Amendment andmany other constitutional and statutory provisions as well.]Third, FDA's program for providing "important information"regarding tobacco use to "users and potential users" of tobacco is unnecessaryand inappropriate.  As discussed in our comments on Subparts C and D,Americans-- young and old alike, smokers as well as nonsmokers--overwhelmingly believe that smoking is harmful.  Young people begin smoking notbecause they fail to appreciate the risks associated with smoking, or becausecigarette advertising and promotion induce them to begin.  They begin to smokebecause of family and peer influences and because of attitudes toward risk.The goal of discouraging tobacco use by young people would more rationally beaddressed by programs to help them resist peer pressure to smoke and byprograms generally addressing adolescent risk-taking behavior.  Instead, FDAhas chosen controls that are unlikely to have any effect on tobacco use byyoung people, but that would exceed FDA's statutory authority, contraveneFCLAA, subvert the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and violate theConstitution.</tt><p><tt>	Before turning to our comments on each of FDA's proposed regulations, weshow that Part 897 as a whole is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of1992 and the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, lies beyond thefederal power under the Commerce Clause, and violates the Tenth and NinthAmendments.  </tt><p><tt></tt><h1>I.

Specifically, in the ADAMHA legislation, Congress added a newSection1926 to the Public Health Service ("PHS") Act that requires eachState to develop and implement an effective program to keep tobacco productsout of the hands of minors as a condition on a State's receipt of its fullshare of federal block grants for the prevention and treatment of substanceabuse.  42U.S.C. [[section]]300x-26.  <p>	Section 1926 of the PHS Act requires that each State:  (1) have in effect alaw prohibiting the sale or distribution of tobacco products to anyone underage 18; (2)enforce that law "in a manner that can reasonably be expectedto reduce" minors' access to tobacco products; (3) "annually conduct random,unannounced inspections" of locations where tobacco products are sold ordistributed "to ensure compliance" with that law; and (4)report annuallyto HHS on the State's strategies, activities, and success in ensuringcompliance with that law.  ]<tt>Id.  Section 1926 also specifies thepenalties that apply when States fail to comply with these requirements.42U.S.C. [[section]]300x-26(c). </tt><p><tt>	The enactment of Section 1926 in July 1992 has produced results:  A totalof 30state legislatures have since passed additional laws to preventyouth access.</tt>"#fn11" [5  Every State now has alaw on its books prohibiting the sale and distribution of tobacco products topersons under the age of 18.  <p>	The youth access laws enacted by the States share many common elements, as dothe enforcement strategies the States pursue, but they are by no meansidentical.  All States, of course, prohibit the sale and distribution oftobacco products to persons under the age of 18.  Beyond that, each State hascrafted an approach that it considers appropriate in light of the particularcircumstances it faces.<p>	Thus, for example, some States have virtually banned the distribution of freetobacco samples; others have strictly limited the places where samples may bedistributed.  The States also have imposed a wide variety of restrictions onthe sale of cigarettes through vending machines-- some limiting cigarettevending machines to places inaccessible to persons under the age of 18, othersrequiring that vending machines in places accessible to such persons besupervised or equipped with electronic locking devices, or both.6  Some Statesalso prohibit the sale of single cigarettes, and some utilize licensingsanctions to promote retailer compliance with the minimum sales-age law.  SomeStates affirmatively require that proof of age be demanded from prospectivepurchasers in doubtful cases; other States do not impose such an affirmativerequirement, but specify that having demanded and being shown apparently validproof of age shall be a defense to a prosecution for selling to an underagepurchaser.  Some States permit local governments to supplement State law withadditional requirements and prohibitions; other States, adhering to a policy ofstatewide uniformity in this field, preclude supplemental local measures.<p>	This diversity is no accident.  There is no known single best approach topreventing youth access to tobacco products.  There are many possibleapproaches from which a State may choose to take account of the wide variety ofinterests affected.<p>	Laws regulating the sale and distribution of tobacco products affect thehundreds of thousands of small businesses that sell tobacco products.  Theyaffect hundreds of tobacco wholesalers, distributors, and vending machineoperators; law-enforcement agencies and other State and local authoritiescharged with ensuring compliance; and all adults who use tobacco products.Each State approaches the problem of youth access against the background of itsown history and culture.  Accordingly, each State's youth access law reflects acareful attempt to fashion an approach tailored to its unique circumstances.<p>	FDA claims that its proposed rules are "intended to support current State lawsregarding sales to minors."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,321.  In fact, FDA's rules wouldinstantly preempt a multitude of State and local laws regulating youth accessto tobacco products.  FDA admits as much by specifying that its proposal wouldpermit only those State and local laws that are at least as "stringent" as theAgency's rules.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,340.  FDA would thus negate the balance struckby each State in attempting to fashion its own means of addressing the problemof youth access, displacing those varied solutions with a one-size-fits-allapproach.  FDA's regulations would, for example, prevent States from emulatingthe successful approach to youth access used in Woodridge, Illinois, as well assuccessful programs in many other communities.<p>	FDA may not preempt any State laws, however, without first making a showing ofclear and manifest congressional intent to authorize its preemption of thoseState laws.  An intention to preempt the traditional police powers of theStates must be "clear and manifest."  ]<tt>See Ricev.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947); Florida Lime &amp;Avocado Growers, Inc.v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 146 (1963).  Wherea federal agency promulgates regulations that would preempt State law, theanalysis is the same:  "The critical question in any preemption analysis isalways whether Congress intended that federal regulation supersede state law"regarding the state authority at issue.  Louisiana Pub. Serv.Comm'nv. Federal Communications Comm'n, 476 U.S. 355, 369(1986).</tt><p><tt>	Far from evidencing any such clear and manifest intent to permit FDA topreempt State laws on youth access to tobacco, Congress in Section1926 ofthe PHS Act clearly affirmed that decisions about how best to reduce youthaccess to tobacco products rest squarely with the States.  Section1926precludes FDA from superimposing its own regime for regulating youth access onthe regimes enacted by the several States.  Because all of proposedPart897 constitutes an effort by FDA to reduce youth access to tobaccoproducts-- and, in particular, to effectuate the "national minimum salesage" that would be established by proposed Section 897.14(a)-- all ofPart897, and not only the SubpartB regulations specificallyaddressing sale and distribution, are precluded by Section 1926.</tt>"#fn14" [7<p>	It is true that, in general, State and local requirements that are differentfrom, or in addition to, requirements imposed by FDA with respect to a deviceare preempted.  FDCA [[section]]521(a), 21 U.S.C.[[section]]360k(a).  If cigarettes were devices and FDA had authority toregulate them as restricted devices, if the particular regulations FDA hasproposed were authorized by the FDCA, and if Section 1926 of the PHS Act hadnot been enacted, then FDA could impose those requirements with a preemptiveeffect.  However, for the reasons stated elsewhere in these comments,cigarettes are not devices, FDA does not have authority to regulate them asrestricted devices, and the proposed regulations are not authorized by theFDCA.<p>	More particularly, Section 1926 of the PHS Act precludes FDA's interpretationof Section 520(e) (or any other provision of the FDCA) as authorizing theproposed regulations.  The existence of Section 1926 demonstrates acongressional intent and policy to preserve, and to encourage the enforcementof, youth access restrictions adopted by individual States.  Preemption ofthose restrictions by a federal agency seeking to impose a single nationalsystem would be entirely inconsistent with that statute.  The preemptive effectthat would flow if the proposed regulations were authorized by Section 520(e)or other provisions of the FDCA demonstrates that the regulations are in fact]<tt>not authorized.  The general language of Section 520(e) or theFDCA as a whole cannot properly be interpreted to authorize FDA to take actiondiametrically opposed to action taken by Congress in a specific and more recentstatute.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, FDA's attempted reconstruction of Section 520(e) and the FDCA as awhole, and the regulations it has proposed pursuant to that reconstruction,are, themselves, precluded by Section 1926 of the PHS Act.</tt><p><h2>A.		Part 897 Impermissibly Abridges Power</h2><tt><b>		That Congress Has Expressly Recognized</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Belongs to theStates&nsp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Long before, and especially since, 1992, the States have been responsiblefor addressing youth access to tobacco products.  This is an area of regulationthat has been traditionally and exclusively a province of the States.  AlthoughFDA claims that its proposed rules would not preempt State laws that are atleast as "stringent" as its own rules, in fact FDA's plan would preemptnumerous State laws concerning, among other things, conditions of retail saleand distribution; the location and operation of tobacco vending machines; thedisplay of tobacco products at retail establishments; and enforcement of, andcompliance with, minimum sales-age laws.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, FDA would preempt the States and their political subdivisionsfrom deciding not to regulate certain aspects of commerce in tobaccoproducts.  For example, various States have considered, but none has adopted,legislation banning open-shelf tobacco product displays.  This is notsurprising given the scarcity of behind-the-counter space in many retailestablishments, and the fact that individual retailers can be expected to dealmore effectively than any bureaucrat with shoplifting from open-shelfdisplays.  FDA would nullify those State determinations by banning self-servicedisplays, and would negate the many local ordinances that have imposed displayrestrictions that stop short of outright bans, leaving intact only those localordinances at least as "stringent" as FDA's own proposed rules.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cannot show that Congress intended to allow it to preempt State lawsthat, in FDA's view, may not be "as stringent" as FDA's plans.  To thecontrary, Congress recently and expressly affirmed by statute that the entirefield of tobacco youth access regulation belongs to the States.  FDA may notenter that field by imposing any federal regulation of youth access to tobaccoproducts.  In Section 1926 of the PHS Act, Congress affirmed that it is theresponsibility of the States to enact and enforce laws that "can reasonably beexpected to reduce the extent to which tobacco products are available toindividuals under the age of 18."  Id. at[[section]]300x-26(b)(1).  </tt><p><tt>	Section1926 makes unmistakably clear Congress' intent that theStates have plenary responsibility-- and "maximum flexibility"</tt>"#fn17" [8-- in the area of youth access totobacco.  Indeed, in the legislative process that led to the enactment ofSection 1926 in 1992, Congress considered and rejected a variety of specificrequirements of the very type that FDA now proposes.<p>	In comments submitted to SAMHSA in connection with proposed regulationsimplementing Section1926, Representative Bliley, a principal party to thecongressional negotiations that produced Section 1926, reviewed the legislativehistory of that provision.  In those comments, he explained:<p>	"Just prior to agreement being reached, Rep. Waxman's staff offered a proposalthat would have required states to adopt laws that, among other things, wouldprohibit the possession or purchase of tobacco products by individuals underage 18, require retailers to display signs providing notice of the minimum saleage and demand proof of age from prospective purchasers, impose location andsupervision restrictions on the sale of tobacco products through vendingmachines, and require that local law enforcement authorities be authorized toenforce these laws.  Again, Rep. Waxman's staff was attempting to interjectproposals to broaden the Secretary's authority beyond the scope agreed to by amajority of the Subcommittee.  For this reason, the proposal was rejected bythe negotiators.<p><p>	"The ultimate agreement established the first national requirement for 18 asthe minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products.  Additionally, weestablished an enforcement mechanism so that there would be a reasonableexpectation that the availability of tobacco products to those under 18 wouldbe reduced, that states would conduct annual, random unannounced inspections toensure compliance, and that each state would file a report documenting effortsmentioned above.  This agreement reflects the intent of the negotiators tobalance the concern for keeping tobacco products out of the hands of personsunder 18 with the interests of sound public policy based on fairness,uniformity and federalism."9<p><p>	Congress thus specifically rejected efforts to impose federal youth accessrestrictions nearly identical to those that FDA has proposed, and opted insteadto give the States wide discretion to devise their own policies to reduce youthaccess to tobacco products.  In fact, Congress called upon States to report toHHS on the decisions ]<tt>the States make to "reduc[e] theavailability of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18." Section1926(b)(2)(B)(ii).  In no event does Section1926 contemplate that aState's decisions with respect to youth access to tobacco can be superseded orpreempted by federal administrative requirements.  </tt><p><tt>	The intent of Congress to reserve to the States the entire field ofregulation of youth access to tobacco is so plain that even HHS hasacknowledged it.  In proposing regulations under Section1926 of the PHSAct, HHS recognized that the power to regulate youth access to tobacco shouldbe left to the States, and that States should have "maximum flexibility" inexercising that power.  58 Fed. Reg. 45,156, 45,161 (Aug. 26, 1993).  HHS did"not propose specifying the provisions of the States' laws," but rather noted"that States remain free to devise any enforcement approaches that they findcost effective."  Id. at 45,156; 45,160.</tt><p><tt>	"[M]aximum flexibility" for the States is exactly what Section1926provides-- and exactly what FDA's proposed regulations would deny.  FDAobviously disagrees with the wide latitude that Congress accorded to the Statesin Section1926 and is attempting to negate that statute by preemptingState laws that it finds insufficiently "stringent."  The Supreme Court'spreemption decisions do not permit FDA to do so.</tt><p><h2>B.		Since the FDCA Broadly Preempts State Law on Medical</h2><tt><b>		Devices, Section1926 of the PHS Act Makes Clear</b></tt><p><tt><b>		That Congress Does Not Intend That FDA Regulate</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Tobacco Products as Medical Devices</b></tt><p><p><tt>	As discussed above, in Section1926 Congress clearly recognized thatthe States should be allowed to exercise broad power to regulate youth accessto tobacco products.  The FDCA, by contrast, significantly limits the States'role in the regulation of medical devices.  The fact that Congress wants theStates to regulate in an area in which FDA's proposed rules would preclude themfrom regulating, through the exercise of the Agency's restricted deviceauthority, further demonstrates that cigarettes cannot be regulated asrestricted medical devices.</tt><p><tt>	Section521(a) of the FDCA provides as follows:</tt><p><tt>"(a)	General Rule</tt><p><p><tt>Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or politicalsubdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to adevice intended for human use any requirement--</tt><p><p><tt>	(1)	which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicableunder this chapter to the device, and</tt><p><p><tt>	(2)	which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to anyother matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under thischapter."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360k(a).</tt><p><p><tt>Subsection (b) of that provision authorizes FDA to exempt frompreemption under Section521(a) a State or local requirement where theState or local government shows that the requirement is more stringent than thecorresponding federal requirement, or that compliance is "required bycompelling local conditions" and would "not cause the device to be in violationof any applicable requirement under this chapter."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]360k(b).</tt><p><tt>	In contrast with the FDCA's draconian preemption of State and localauthority over medical devices, Congress expressly provided inSection1926 of the PHS Act that each State is responsible for devisingthe means it considers most reasonable and appropriate to implementyouth access restrictions.  Thus Section1926 makes clear that cigarettescannot be regulated as medical devices.</tt><p><p><h2>C.		Even If Tobacco Products Could Be Regulated as Medical Devices, CongressHas Reserved to the States the Power To Decide How Youth Access to Such Alleged"Medical Devices" Should Be Regulated&nsp;      </h2><p><tt>	If tobacco products could be regulated as medical devices under the FDCA(and they cannot), State laws regulating youth access to tobacco products wouldbe preempted under FDCA [[section]] 521(a).  The FDCA would therefore be indirect conflict with Section1926 of the PHS Act, which expresslyrecognizes that such regulation is to be by the States.  The Supreme Court hasrepeatedly held that federal courts are loath to conclude that two federalstatutes conflict, see, e.g., Ruckelshausv.Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1017 (1984); and, as shown above,Section1926 is entirely consistent with the settled interpretation of theFDCA, which excludes tobacco products from FDA regulation.  </tt><p><tt>	A conflict between the FDCA and Section 1926 arises not from the text,legislative history, settled judicial and administrative interpretation andlongstanding congressional understanding of the FDCA, but only from FDA'sunprecedented and recently announced reinterpretation of the FDCA.  Even ifFDA's reinterpretation of the FDCA were otherwise a permissible one, and themedical device provisions of the FDCA and Section1926 thus came intoconflict, Congress's specific acceptance of the power of the States to decidehow to regulate youth access to tobacco products, as expressed in the 1992enactment of Section1926, would prevail over the general medical deviceprovisions of the FDCA, which, as shown in VolumeV of our comments, wereenacted prior to Section1926 and do not mention the issue of youth accessto tobacco products.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, as a result of Congress' clear expression of its intent inSection1926 that States decide how to regulate in this area, FDA wouldnot have power to preempt State laws even if tobacco products were"medical devices" (and they are not).  Like the Rural ElectrificationAdministration in Wabash Valley Power Ass'nv. RuralElectrification Admin., 988 F.2d 1480, 1485 (7th Cir. 1993), FDA "mustovercome two significant obstacles."  The Agency must show not only thattobacco products are medical "devices," but also that Congress has authorizedFDA, in its regulation of these alleged medical "devices," to preempt theStates in fashioning programs to address the issue of youth smoking.See id. at 1485-86.  FDA can make neither showing.</tt><p><h1>II.

FDA's proposed regulations are thereforeprecluded.</tt><p><tt>	Congress has repeatedly expressed its "clear mandate" that itremain the exclusive policymaking body with respect to health-based regulationof cigarette advertising, promotion, and labeling, and that any governmentalaction in these areas be dependent on "specific" congressionalauthorization:</tt><p><tt>"[T]he clear mandate of the Congress [is] that the basic regulation oftobacco and tobacco products is governed by the legislation dealing with thesubject, the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1969, and that anyfurther regulation in this sensitive and complex area must be reserved forspecific Congressional action."  S. Rep. No. 251, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 43(1976) (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>	When Congress enacted FCLAA in 1965, it did so with the express intentionof "establish[ing] a comprehensive Federal program to deal withcigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationshipbetween smoking and health."  15 U.S.C.

To the contrary, Congress made clear its intent to reserveto itself this area of cigarette regulation:</tt><p><tt>"The determination of appropriate remedial action in this area... is a responsibility which should be exercised by the Congressafter considering all facets of the problem."

The Court noted that its analysiscomported with FCLAA's stated purpose of preventing diverse and non-uniformcigarette regulations.

Specifically, the 1969amendments to FCLAA (1) made it unlawful to advertise cigarettes on televisionand radio after January1, 1971; (2)suspended, until July1,1971, the proposed FTC rulemaking relating to health warnings in cigaretteadvertising; (3) required the FTC to notify Congress of any ?proposedregulations after that date; and (4) prohibited the FTC from implementing suchregulations until six months after giving Congress notice "in order that theCongress may act if it so desires."  ]<tt>See H.R.

Congress saw no need to rein inclaimed regulatory authority by FDA because FDA had never claimed any suchauthority.  Indeed, during Congress' consideration of FCLAA, FDA had explicitlydisavowed to Congress that it had any such authority.<p>	When the legislation enacted in 1965 as FCLAA was proposed, the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare ("HEW," now HHS), the federal agency thenresponsible for administration of the FDCA and the Federal Hazardous SubstancesLabeling Act ("FHSLA"), responded to requests by Congress for commentsregarding the proposed legislation.  In its comments, HEW recognized its ownlack of authority (as well as FDA's) with respect to cigarette labeling andadvertising regulations.  In fact, HEW requested that Congress enact "specificlegislation" to "bring the labeling of cigarettes, by appropriate amendment,under [FHSLA]," and HEW suggested that FHSLA "be amended to authorize us, onthe basis of the current state of knowledge at any given time, to formulate byregulation an appropriate warning."  H.R. Rep. No. 449, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.10 (1965).  These suggestions were rejected by Congress when it enactedFCLAA.16  FDA therefore has a heavy burden to show that Congress neverthelessintended in 1969 to confer such authority upon the FDA when it amended FCLAA.There is not one word in the legislative history to support such a result.<p>	Even the FTC was precluded by the 1969 amendments from taking "any action"regarding health warnings in cigarette advertising prior to July1, 1971,and any such action was to be subject to review by Congress before takingeffect.  Pub. L. No.91-222, 79 Strat. 282, 283 (1970) (codified as 15U.S.C. [[section]]1333(a)).  In light of Congress' well-foundedbelief that FDA had no jurisdiction in this field, and in light of the strictlimitations Congress placed upon even the FTC's authority by the 1969amendments, it is preposterous to adopt FDA's theory that Congress somehowintended the 1969 amendments to FCLAA to ]<tt>open the field toregulation by the FDA.  Rather, the 1969 amendments confirm Congress' intent togrant only a limited and conditional authority to the FTC but otherwise toremain the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to health-based regulation ofcigarette labeling and advertising:</tt><p><tt>"It is obvious that if [the regulations proposed by the FCC and FTC] areallowed to go into effect ***they would have an impact onareas far beyond those intended by the Congress to be regulated by theseagencies.  The regulations raise basic constitutional questions and wouldaffect the growing, sale, and manufacturing of tobacco for cigarettes and thepersons involved in or affected by those activities.  These activities cutacross the whole spectrum of commercial and social life in the United States.It is therefore an area where the Congress, if anyone, must make policy.</tt><p><p><tt>	*    *    *</tt><p><p><tt>"Aside from the questions of constitutional and statutory law which the twoagencies' proposed rules raise, they are an assumption by these agencies ofpolicymaking with respect to a subject matter on which the Congress has madepolicy (see sec. 5(b) of the act), has stated its intention to be the exclusivepolicymaker on the subject matter, at least until July 1, 1969 (see sec. 10 ofthe act), and has given strong indication of its intention to continue to doso.</tt><p><p><tt>"Therefore, the committee feels that it is incumbent on the Congress to acton the reported legislation in order to prevent intrusion by [the FCC] and [theFTC] into basic areas of policymaking which it has reserved to itself."  H.R.Rep. No. 289, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5 (1969) (footnote omitted).</tt><p><p><tt>	Congress' reservation of virtually all aspects of the field of smoking andhealth is underscored both by the limited authority conferred on the FTC and bythe requirement that the FTC regularly report to Congress so that, if need be,further legislation could be enacted.  As originally promulgated,Section1337 of the Act required that HEW report to Congress annuallyregarding potential health consequences of smoking, and that the FTC provideannual reports on "current practices and methods of cigarette advertising andpromotion."  Congress further instructed each agency to include"recommendations for legislation" as each might deem appropriate.  Pub. L. No.89-92,[[section]] 5(d), 79 Stat. 282, 283 (1965) (current version at 15 U.S.C.[[section]] 1337).  These provisions remain in effect today.  FDA's proposedregulations ignore Congress' express definition of the role of federaladministrative agencies in regulating in these areas.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cannot point to any provision in FCLAA or in the legislative historythat contemplates its regulation of cigarette advertising, promotion, orlabeling.  Indeed, in view of HEW's prior comments on the 1965 legislation,Congress had no reason to believe that FDA would seek to expand itsbureaucratic reach to encompass cigarette advertising or promotion.  Contraryto FDA's argument, the reference in Section1334(b) to preemption of"State" (rather than "federal") requirements and prohibitions reflects(i)Congress' understanding (resting in part on FDA's own longstandinginterpretation of the FDCA) that the FTC was the sole federal agency that hadany health-based regulatory authority over cigarette advertising and promotion(including "labeling" as that term is used in the FDCA) and (ii)Congress'intent that, with that one exception, no State or federal agency was toexercise any such authority.</tt>"#fn35" [17<p>	The amendments respecting future activities of the FTC limited the FTC'sregulatory activities to the possible issuance of a trade regulation rulerequiring a health warning in cigarette advertising,18 and such action wasdeemed by Congress as establishing the ]<tt>only method by whichany federal agency could act with respect to regulation of cigaretteadvertising:</tt><p><tt>"The managers on the part of the House expect that the proceedingdescribed in section 7(a) of the conference agreement will be the only basis onwhich any Federal department or agency could require a statement relating tosmoking and health in cigarette advertising."  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 897,91st Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1970) (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>FDA completely disregards this dispositive expression of congressionalintent with respect to any additional regulation of advertising byany federal agency in connection with smoking and health.</tt><p><tt>	Further, the legislative history of the 1969 Act -- in particular, theevents leading up to an amendment adopted to meet the specific concern ofSenator Magnuson and others regarding cigarette advertising and young people --confirms that Congress viewed the FTC as the only federal agency withany authority in this field. </tt><p><tt>	As reported by the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee on June5, 1969, H.R. 6543 strengthened the package health warning (Section 4) andpostponed until July 1, 1975, the expiration of the ban on health warnings incigarette advertising (Section 10).  The language of the preemption provision(Section 5), as enacted in 1965, was unchanged in H.R. 6543.  See H.R.Rep. No. 289, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1969). </tt><p><tt>	Four members of the Committee, in two separate statements, indicated theirunderstanding that the preemption provision, as reported by the Committee,precluded limitations on cigarette advertising aimed at young people.  Rep.Kyros, urging that "the interests of young persons" be taken into account,proposed that H.R. 6543 be amended to give the FTC and the FCC "authority toenact, after notice and opportunity for hearing, reasonable regulations tolimit or prohibit advertising directed toward audiences composed substantiallyof persons under 21 years of age."  H.R. Rep. No. 289, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 27(1969) (additional comments of Rep. Kyros).  Rep. Kyros, who later wasappointed one of the House Managers, obviously recognized that the 1965 Act(and H.R. 6543) precluded such action by the FTC and the FCC, and anyother federal agency.  His proposal to remove that bar, however, was notaccepted.</tt><p><tt>	When H.R. 6543 was debated on the House floor, supporters as well asopponents viewed it as continuing to preempt all regulation of cigaretteadvertising by federal agencies and the States.  Thus, Rep.Quillen, asupporter of the bill, stated:  </tt><p><tt>"The purpose of the bill is to stiffen the warning currently required onall cigarette packages and to prohibit for an additional period of 6 years anyregulation or interference with tobacco advertising by any Federal or Stateregulatory agencies.</tt><p><p><tt>	*     *     *</tt><p><p><tt>"By extending the act, the bill effectively continues the currentabsolute prohibition placed upon all regulatory agencies, Federal andState.  None may interfere with or place any limitation upon cigaretteadvertising, nor can they require any other caution to be placed upon acigarette package than is already provided by the bill."  115 Cong. Rec. 16,159(1969) (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>	After the House passed H.R. 6543 on June 18, 1969,</tt>"#fn36" [19 the bill went to the Senate, where it wasreferred to the Commerce Committee.  The version of H.R. 6543 reported by theSenate Commerce Committee on December 5, 1969 strengthened the health warningon cigarette packages (Section 4), banned cigarette advertising on televisionand radio after January1, 1971 (Section 6) and barred the FTC fromundertaking to require health warnings in cigarette advertising for 18 monthsthereafter, until July 1, 1972 (Section 7(a)).  The bill also substantiallybroadened the second clause of the preemption provision, pertaining toadvertising, to specify that no other "requirements or prohibitions" based onsmoking and health could be imposed under State law "with respect to theadvertising or promotion of any cigarettes" (Section 5(b)).S.Rep.No.566, 91st Cong., 1st Sess.12 (1969).  It wasthis broader version of the preemption provision that ultimately was enacted.]<tt>See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 897, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 5(1970).</tt><p><tt>	Senator Magnuson, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, alongwith eight other members of the Committee, expressed concern about theprovision of the legislation that prohibited the FTC from undertaking torequire health warnings in cigarette advertising until July1, 1972.These nine Senators expressed concern that barring action by the FTC whilesimultaneously preempting the States would result in there being "no meaningfuldefense" against advertising "designed to make smoking appealing to youngpeople," because both the FTC and the States would be powerless to act.  S.Rep. No. 566, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 19-20 (1969) (individual views of SenatorsMagnuson, Pastore, Hart, Cannon, Moss, Long, Inouye, Tydings andGoodell).</tt>"#fn36" [20  Senators Magnuson andGoodell reiterated this concern on the Senate floor.  115 Cong.Rec.38,737-38 (1969).  Plainly, the Senators understood that, amongfederal agencies, only the FTC had any authority over cigarette advertising.They plainly understood, in other words, that the reference to "state law" inthis proposed preemption provision would not empower any federal agency otherthan the FTC.<p>	To meet the expressed concerns over the vacuum created by removal of the FTCfrom the field, H.R. 6543 was amended to shorten by one year (until July 1,1971) the period during which the FTC would be precluded from acting.]<tt>Id. at 38,740-42.  The amendment solved the concern of SenatorMagnuson and the eight other Senators who joined him that the federalgovernment, having precluded State and local regulation of cigaretteadvertising and promotion, should not tie its own hands by suspending FTCrulemaking for too long a period.  The amendment, however, confirms thatCongress did not consider FDA authorized to provide a "meaningful defense"against advertising "designed to make smoking appealing to young people," butinstead viewed the FTC as having, among federal agencies, exclusive authorityin this field.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's position requires it to argue that, as soon as the 1969 amendmentsto FCLAA became effective, it was free to exercise plenary power over allhealth-related aspects of cigarette advertising and promotion even thoughCongress would not permit the FTC to exercise even the limited authority itgave that agency until many months later.  FDA has offered not one word toexplain why Congress would have intended such a result.  It cannot.  In lightof the legislative history, it is preposterous to attribute any such intent toCongress.  </tt><p><tt>	In sum, given FCLAA's structure and statement of purpose, it would beabsurd to interpret Section 1334(b) in any other way than as precluding allhealth-based state and federal regulation over cigarette advertising andpromotion, save for the limited authority conferred on the Federal TradeCommission.  The statutory language, properly interpreted, thus expresslyprecludes FDA's proposed regulations, which are avowedly designed to imposerequirements and prohibitions based on smoking and health with respect to theadvertising, promotion, and labeling of cigarettes.</tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>	B.	FDA's Proposed Regulations Are Impliedly</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Precluded by the FCLAA                  </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The proposed FDA regulations are in any event impliedly precluded byFCLAA.  They are contrary to, and indeed would nullify, some of Congress' mostimportant objectives in enacting that statute.</tt>"#fn36" [21]<p><tt><b>		1.	The Proposed FDA Regulations Conflict with</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Congress' Purposes                        </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's proposed regulations would do more than conflict with Congress'purposes in enacting FCLAA.  They would in fact eviscerate the policies andobjectives of the comprehensive program established by Congress to deal withcigarette regulation.</tt><p><tt>	As enacted in 1965 and amended in 1969, the FCLAA left no room for doubtthat Congress intended to have the sole responsibility for prescribing a"comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertisingwith respect to any relationship between smoking and health" (15 U.S.C.[[section]] 1331).  This purpose was confirmed in the 1984 amendments to FCLAA,which replaced the package warning provisions of the 1969 amendments to Section1333 with a comprehensively prescribed series of warning requirements forcigarette packages, billboard advertisements, and all other advertisements.The amended Section 1333 contains additional provisions relating to theconspicuousness and format of the label and advertising warnings, and to therotation of the several prescribed warnings.</tt><p><tt>	These comprehensive statutory warning requirements, together with thecongressional declaration of policy and purpose in Section 1331, leave no roomwhatever for FDA, or any other federal agency, to propose an alternative orsupplementary scheme for the health-based regulation of the advertising,promotion, or labeling of cigarettes.  As last amended in 1984, Section 1331provides:</tt><p><tt>	"It is the policy of the Congress, and the purpose of this chapter, toestablish a comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling andadvertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,whereby--</tt><p><p><tt>		"(1) the public may be adequately informed about any adverse healtheffects of cigarette smoking by inclusion of warning notices on each package ofcigarettes and in each advertisement of cigarettes; and</tt><p><p><tt>		"(2) commerce and the national economy may be (A) protected to themaximum extent consistent with this declared policy and (B) not impeded bydiverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertisingregulations with respect to any relationship between smoking andhealth."</tt><p><p><tt>	Every aspect of this provision bespeaks an express and unmistakable intentthat the FCLAA regulatory scheme be the sole means for health-basedregulation of cigarette advertising.  Congress established a "comprehensiveFederal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising" wherebythe public would be "adequately informed" by "inclusion of warning notices oneach package of cigarettes and in each advertisement of cigarettes."Further, Congress declared its intent that commerce be protected and "notimpeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling andadvertising regulations with respect to any relationship betweensmoking and health."  (Emphasis added.)</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed scheme for regulation of the advertising, promotion andlabeling of cigarettes (including its proposed "national education campaign")flies in the face of this explicit congressional policy.  The comprehensiveadvertising and labeling program prescribed in FCLAA would unquestionably be"impeded" by the "diverse, nonuniform, and confusingcigarette...advertising regulations" proposed byFDA.</tt><p><tt>	FCLAA reflects a carefully crafted balance between informing the publicregarding the possible health risks of smoking and protecting what Congressdeemed to be an important part of the nation's commerce.  On the one hand,Congress imposed heavy and unprecedented burdens on the cigarettemanufacturers-- forbidding the manufacturers to advertise their productson radio and television (15 U.S.C. [[section]]1335), and requiringcigarette packages and other advertising to carry warnings prescribed byCongress (15 U.S.C. [[section]]1333).  On the other hand, Congress madeclear its intent to protect the national economy from the burdens of furtherhealth-based cigarette labeling and advertising restraints.  What Congress saidin 1969 concerning the then-proposedregulations of the FTC and FCC applies with even greater force to the FDA'sproposed regulations:</tt><p><tt>"The regulations raise basic constitutional questions and would affect thegrowing, sale, and manufacturing of tobacco for cigarettes and the personsinvolved in or affected by those activities.  These activities cut across thewhole spectrum of commercial and social life in the United States.  It istherefore an area where the Congress, if anyone, must make policy."  H.R. Rep.No. 289, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1969).</tt><p><p><tt>FDA's proposed regulations would make a shambles of this balance ofpurposes. </tt><p><tt>	First, there can be no question that the regulations are calculatedto have an enormous impact upon commerce in tobacco products.  That is theirvery purpose.  Congress intended, however, that the sole health-basedrestraints that were to be imposed upon that commerce were to be those providedin the Act --namely, a warning label that Congress itself crafted, a preclusion of broadcastadvertising, a limited authority to the FTC (superseded by statute in 1984) topropose regulations requiring the Congressional label to appear in advertisingand promotional materials and a provision for continuing monitoring of thehealth risks of smoking by Congress itself.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, although FDA contends that its regulations would "furtherCongressional intent" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,352), the regulations would, in fact,have the opposite effect.  The requirements and prohibitions contained in Part897 conflict directly with the regulatory scheme adopted by Congress and theresponsibilities delegated by Congress to the FTC.</tt>"#fn36" [22  Moreover, under Section897.42(a),discussed below and at greater length in the comments on SubpartE, FDAinvites the further creation of an entirely separate set of diverse,nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations byState and local authorities.<p>	As the Supreme Court in ]<tt>Cipollone confirmed (505 U.S. at 524),Congress intended to preempt the imposition of requirements and prohibitions oncigarette manufacturers based on claims that they should have provided"additional, or more clearly stated, warnings" in their cigarette advertisingor promotions.  Congress took it upon itself to evaluate the scientificevidence and to draft warnings that it deemed to be "adequate" in light of suchevidence.  15 U.S.C. [[section]]1331.  </tt><p><tt>	According to FDA, however, the new "brief statement" required by Section897.32(c) would contain "information regarding relevant warnings, precautions,side effects, and contraindications."  60Fed. Reg. 41,338.  The Agencyintends to take it upon itself to dictate the "exact language" of the newwarning statements "to ensure that this information is conveyed accurately andeffectively."  Id.  These new requirements are to be imposed despite theextensive consideration given by Congress to the development of an appropriateand effective program of rotating warnings on labels and advertising, and thedelicate balance of competing interests that Congress struck in establishingthat program.</tt>"#fn39" [23  By enacting its"comprehensive" federal program, which is designed to ensure that the public is"adequately" informed while protecting commerce and the national economy,Congress intended to preclude not only State authorities but also other federalagencies, such as FDA, from undermining its carefully crafted program.  FDA'sregulations, however, would do just that.<p>	Indeed, FDA's recent focus group report, 60 Fed. Reg. 61,670-79, highlightsthe inherent and fundamental conflict between FCLAA and FDA's proposedregulations.  In formulating its carefully balanced program, Congress gaveexhaustive and comprehensive consideration to the specific language, size,format, and placement of the federal warning labels.  Congress considered itswarnings to be adequate to inform the public of the potential health risks ofsmoking.  ]<tt>See 15 U.S.C. [[section]]1331.  Nevertheless,FDA apparently proposes to have all of these issues reweighed and the warningregime established by Congress reformulated, on the basis of a few groupdiscussions with a handful of teenagers.</tt><p><tt>	FDA explicitly seeks to justify its proposed regulations on the groundthat "the imagery used in industry advertising and promotional programsobscures adolescent perceptions of the significance of the associated healthrisks... of tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,361.According to FDA, the "attractive imagery" of cigarette advertising "overwhelmsthe government's health messages."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,329.</tt>"#fn49" [24  But Congress clearly intended FCLAA tosupersede the imposition of additional warning requirements based upon suchtheories.  FDA's complex new warning regime would defeat that undeniableintent. <p>	FDA's regulations would nullify the intent of Congress in other respects aswell.  As part of its comprehensive federal program, including a determinationto protect consumers from further health-basedadvertising controls, Congress concluded that nonbroadcast cigaretteadvertising, including outdoor billboard advertising, should remain lawful aslong as that advertising carries the congressionally mandated warnings.  15U.S.C. [[section]]1333.  Congress made this determination despiteassertions, similar to those by FDA, that cigarette advertising causes smokingto be associated with such positive attributes as contentment, glamor, romance,youth, and happiness.  Similarly, Congress has considered and rejectedproposals to limit cigarette advertising to a black-and-white"tombstone" format.  ]<tt>See, e.g., H.R. 5041, 101stCong., 2d Sess.11 (1990).</tt><p><tt>	Ignoring these congressional decisions, FDA has concluded that banningcertain outdoor advertising, including billboards (Section 897.30(b)), andlimiting other advertising to black text on a white background (Section897.32(a)) would be appropriate.  These drastic limitations on cigaretteadvertising are completely at odds with the comprehensive legislation enactedby Congress.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed regulations further conflict with Congress' decision todelegate limited regulatory authority to the FTC with respect to certainaspects of cigarette advertising.  Congress has never delegated to FDA anyauthority with respect to cigarette advertising, or any other matters relatingto cigarettes.  FDA's effort to usurp this authority by administrative fiat isunlawful and will result in the very evil that Congress intended to prevent:the adverse effect upon commerce caused by diverse, nonuniform, and confusingcigarette labeling and advertising regulations.  </tt><p><tt>	For example, the FTC, in the exercise of its statutory authority, hasissued consent orders holding that functional promotional items, such asashtrays, cigarette cases and lighters, and articles of clothing, may beprovided to consumers without carrying the congressional warning label.</tt>"#fn54" [25  Congress adopted these consent orders whenit amended FCLAA in 1984.26  Proposed Section 897.34 would prohibit completelythe use of promotional items such as those permitted under the consent ordersissued by the FTC and adopted by Congress.  <p>	Similarly, FDA's regulations would presumably prohibit many aspects of the"Joe Camel" advertising and promotional campaign, as well as many othercampaigns, despite the FTC's findings with regard to that campaign.27  Thus,under FDA's proposed regulations, cigarette manufacturers would be held toseparate and conflicting standards of conduct by different federal agencies, aresult that undermines a fundamental purpose of FCLAA. <p>	Conflicting, nonuniform, or at least duplicative, regulations are all butensured by FDA's proposed regulations.  In the first instance, the industrywould be required to provide one set of warnings on cigarette packages (thoserequired by Congress), entirely different sets of warnings in cigaretteadvertisements (those required by Congress ]<tt>and those prescribedby FDA) and another set in the "national educational campaigns," which themanufacturers would be compelled to sponsor.  Furthermore, all cigaretteadvertising would be subject not only to FTC oversight, as expresslycontemplated by Congress, but also to FDA scrutiny, pursuant toSection897.36, as well as the scrutiny of State and local governments,pursuant to proposed Section897.42(a).</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, Section897.36 provides its own prohibition against "false ormisleading" advertising, and is filled with vague and amorphous criteria.See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,339-40, 41,375.  A cigarette advertisementconsidered lawful under FTC standards might still violate FDA's regulationsbecause it "lacks fair balance" or because misleading representations are"suggested" by the "design" of the advertisement.  60Fed. Reg. 41,339.FCLAA was intended to prevent just such a crazy-quilt pattern of inconsistentregulation.</tt><p><tt>	Section897.42(a) exacerbates the conflict between FCLAA and FDA'sproposed regulations:</tt><p><tt>"In addition to the requirements imposed under this part,manufacturers...shall comply with any more stringentState or local requirements relating to the sale, distribution, labeling,advertising, or use of cigarettes...provided that thoseState or local requirements do not conflict with the requirements under thispart.  These more stringent State or local requirements are notpreempted...."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,375.</tt><p><p><tt>	This remarkable provision thus invites State and local governments to doprecisely what FCLAA expressly forbids.  Although FDA acknowledges thepreemptive force of Section1334(b) so far as State and local action isconcerned, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,352-53, FDA declares in Section897.42 that any"more stringent" State and local requirements "are not preempted" (by theFDCA).  Under the quoted language, all these "unpreempted" State and localrequirements would then automatically become FDA requirements, enforceable byFDA through civil penalties and other administrative remedies and by theU.S.Department of Justice in the federal courts.</tt><p><tt>	Needless to say, FDA has no authority to resuscitate statepower to impose restraints on advertising that Congress prohibited inFCLAA.  Congress has already made clear its intent to prohibit the very type ofdiverse and nonuniform regulations envisioned by FDA:</tt><p><tt>"[T]he bill [1969 Act] * * * [p]rohibits health-related regulation or prohibition of cigarette advertising by any State orlocal authority."  S.Rep. No. 566, 91st Cong., 1st Sess.1(1970).</tt><p><p><tt>	In sum, Section897.42 invites "diverse, nonuniform and confusing"requirements and prohibitions with respect to cigarette labeling andadvertising-- a result directly forbidden by Congress.  See 15U.S.C. [[section]]1331.  For all of these reasons, FCLAA precludes FDA'sproposed regulations pertaining to cigarette advertising, promotion, andlabeling.</tt><p><tt><b>		2.  FDA's Preemption Analysis Is Incorrect</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's analysis is apparently premised on the mistaken assumption that thejudicially developed doctrine of implied federal preemption of State and locallaws is directly applicable in assessing the relationship between inconsistentfederal statutes.  As a large body of case law makes clear, however, thedoctrine of implied federal preemption derives from the Supremacy Clause, whichprovides that the Constitution and laws of the United States shall be thesupreme law of the land "any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state tothe contrary," and from the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the States allpowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.  </tt><p><tt>	The Supremacy Clause and the Tenth Amendment of course have no applicationin determining the relationship between different federal statutes thatarguably overlap in their application to particular circumstances or issues.The sole statutory justification offered by FDA for its regulatory scheme isthe generic drug and device provisions of the FDCA.  Even if these generalstatutory provisions could be said to authorize the FDA regulations (which theydo not), they must clearly give way to the more specific comprehensive programestablished by Congress to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising withrespect to any relationship between smoking and health.  In particular, theymust give way to Congress' clearly articulated purpose to grant limitedresponsibility in this field only to the FTC.  The congressional declaration ofpolicy and purpose in Section 1331, and the detailed advertising and labelwarning provisions of Section 1333, are as specific and particular as Congresscould draw them.  FDA's reliance on the general-- and heretoforeinapplicable-- provisions of the FDCA (that neither in its text nor itslegislative history even mentions cigarettes, smoking, smoking and health, oryouth access) to establish a conflicting and necessarily confusing regulatoryscheme for cigarettes can only be seen as an unlawful effort to undermine thecongressional purpose in enacting FCLAA.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has sought to avoid the unmistakable congressional intent to establisha single and uniform regulatory program for cigarette advertising andpromotion, by relying on its own interpretation of the preemption language inSection 1334, and its own reading of the case law relating to implied federalpreemption of State law.  FDA's reliance on its variant reading of theimplied federal preemption cases is totally misplaced.  The Supremacy Clause,the Tenth Amendment, and the Court's desire to preserve the police power of theStates are the governing authorities in assessing inconsistencies between Stateand federal laws.  These authorities obviously have no direct application indetermining the interplay between two federal statutes.  In those instances,the Supreme Court has invariably determined that a specific statute--such as FCLAA-- must take precedence over, or be deemed an exception to,a general statute-- such as FDCA.  See, e.g.,Busicv. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980);Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 125 (1904);Townsend v. Little, 109 U.S. 504, 512 (1883).  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's position would be wrong even if an implied preemption analysis underthe Supremacy Clause were appropriate here.</tt>"#fn64" [28  FDA's central claim (based on its mistakennotion that Section1334(b) does not exclude FDA from the field) is thatan implied preemption analysis is prohibited when a statute contains an expresspreemption provision.  That argument was squarely rejected in]<tt>Freightliner Corp.v. Myrick, 115 S. Ct. 1483(1995):</tt><p><tt>"According to respondents and the Court of Appeals, Cipollone v.Liggett Group Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407(1992), held that implied pre-emptioncannot exist when Congress has chosen to include an express pre-emptionclause in a statute.  This argument is without merit.  </tt><p><p><tt>	*    *    *</tt><p><tt>	</tt><p><tt>"The fact that an express definition of the pre-emptivereach of a statute `implies'-- i.e. supports a reasonable inference--thatCongress did not intend to pre-emptother matters does not mean that the express clause entirely forecloses anypossibility of implied pre-emption. Indeed, just two paragraphs after the quoted passage in Cipollone, weengaged in a conflict pre-emptionanalysis of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 79 Stat. 282,as amended, 15 U.S.C. [[section]] 1331 et seq., and found `no general,inherent conflict between federal preemption of state warning requirements andthe continued vitality of state common law damages actions.'  505 U.S. at 518,112 S. Ct. at 2618."  115 S. Ct. at 1487-88. </tt><p><p><tt>	In Freightliner, the Court held that implied preemption arises froman "actual conflict"</tt>"#fn83" [29 with a federalstatute or when the "scope of a statute indicates that Congress intendedfederal law to occupy a field exclusively."  115 S. Ct. at 1487 (citing]<tt>English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 78-79(1990)).</tt><p><tt>	As the Court explained in Cipollone, the "ultimate touchstone ofpreemption analysis" is the "purpose of Congress."  505 U.S. at 516 (citingMalonev. White Motor Corp., 435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978)(quoting Retail Clerksv. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96,103 (1963))).  That purpose may be expressly stated in the statute's languageor implicitly contained in the Act's structure and purpose.  505 U.S. at 516(citing Jonesv. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 525(1977)).</tt><p><tt>	An analysis of Congress' purpose in enacting FCLAA leads inexorably to theconclusion that the FDA regulations would conflict with FCLAA's language,structure and legislative history.  Thus, they would be "preempted" even if itwere appropriate to apply the more demanding Supremacy Clause preemptionanalysis, with its strong presumption against preemption of state police power.The FDA regulations would gut the purposes and policies underlying FCLAA.  Theywould intrude upon matters that Congress has clearly reserved to itself or toother federal agencies, and would impose requirements and prohibitions oncommerce that directly conflict with the purposes of FCLAA.  Therefore, FDA'sregulations are precluded.</tt><p><h1>III.	PART 897 LIES BEYOND THE FEDERAL POWER </h1><tt><b>	UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND VIOLATES </b></tt><p><tt>	<b>THE TENTH AND NINTHAMENDMENTS</b></tt><p><p><h2>A.	  Commerce Clause</h2><tt>	The effect of Part 897 (specifically Section 897.14(a)) is to create anational minimum sales age; this, indeed, appears to be its purpose.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,314, 41,323.  All of the other proposed rules are intended toeffectuate that national minimum sales age See, e.g., 60Fed. Reg. 41,350.  Establishing a national minimum sales age, however, liesbeyond the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.  Part 897 asa whole therefore exceeds the federal commerce power.</tt><p><tt>	In fostering a "nationwide" twenty-one-year-old drinking age, Congress didnot legislate directly.  Instead, it conditioned receipt of federal highwayfunds on States' raising the drinking age.  23 U.S.C. [[section]]158.The Supreme Court upheld this measure as an exercise of Congress' spendingpower, but expressly refused to hold that Congress could enact such a measuredirectly.  South Dakotav. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206(1987).</tt><p><tt>	Because Part 897 is not linked to any expenditure of federal funds, itcannot rest upon Congress' power to tax and spend for the general welfare.  Theonly conceivable source of power for such a regulation would be Congress' powerto regulate interstate commerce.  FDA has asserted jurisdiction over cigarettesand smokeless tobacco under the "device" provisions of the FDCA, a law enactedpursuant to Congress' Commerce Clause power.  See United Statesv. Sullivan, 332 U.S. 689, 697 (1948); Chaney v. Heckler,718 F.2d 1174, 1181 (1983) ("FDCA is based on the Commerce power"),rev'd on other grounds, 470 U.S. 821 (1985).  Forboth of these reasons, we analyze the proposed regulations under the CommerceClause, which is the only federal power on which they could possibly bebased.</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court applies a two-pronged test in assessing theconstitutionality of a law enacted under the Commerce power.  First, theCourt will "defer to a congressional finding that a regulated activity affectsinterstate commerce if there is any rational basis for such a finding."Preseaultv. ICC, 494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990).  SeeUnited States v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 1630 (1995) (an activitymust "substantially affect" interstate commerce in order to be within Congress'power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause).  Second, the Court askswhether the legislation "is reasonably adapted to the end permitted by theConstitution."  Id.</tt><p><tt>	Here, of course, FDA is unable to point to any congressional findings atall.  In part, of course, this is because Part 897 is a regulation and not astatute.  More importantly, however, neither the text nor the legislativehistory of the FDCA, of FCLAA, nor of any other federal statute provides abasis for a finding that FDA has "device" jurisdiction over cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco products.  </tt><p><tt>	Although Congress has made clear in FCLAA-- for purposes of thatstatute-- that cigarette advertising, promotion and labeling are mattersaffecting "commerce and the national economy" (15 U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]1331, 1334), it also has made equally clear (asdiscussed above) that regulation of youth access is a matter of State concern.ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, Pub. L. No.102-321,106 Stat. 323 (1992); Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. No.91-222,84 Stat. 87 (1970); S. Rep. No.566, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1969)(State and local laws "with respect to...the sale ofcigarettes to minors" are not preempted by FCLAA).  FDA's about-faceon the question of its own jurisdiction over cigarettes leaves the recordbarren of the necessary congressional fact-finding required by the Constitutionto justify extension of federal power into the traditionally State-controlleddomain of tobacco sales.  </tt><p><tt>	Worse, FDA has not shown Part 897 to be reasonably adapted to somepermissible end.  Preseault, 494 U.S. at 17.  As one court has expressedit, this second prong of Commerce Clause analysis requires a determination"whether the specific activities... are those intended to bereached by Congress through the statute."  United Statesv.Holland, 373 F.Supp. 665, 673 (M.D. Fla. 1974) (citingPerezv. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971)).  </tt><p><tt>	As we demonstrate in Volume I of these comments, there is absolutely noevidence that Congress intended FDA to regulate cigarettes and smokelesstobacco, much less to impose controls of the radical type the Agency hasproposed.  Indeed, as discussed above, there is direct evidence of a contrarycongressional intent in FCLAA and the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992.  Inthe absence of support in the text or legislative history of the FDCA for theproposition that regulation of tobacco sales to minors is within FDA'sstatutory power, and in the face of strong, specific evidence that suchregulation is not within FDA's statutory power, the regulations lack afoundation in Congress' Commerce Clause power. </tt><p><tt>	Even if there were evidence that Congress contemplated regulation ofcigarettes, under the Supreme Court's recent holding in UnitedStatesv. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995), the proposed nationalminimum sales age clearly lies beyond Congress' commerce power and encroacheson the domain reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment.  The LopezCourt held that the commerce power, although it includes the power to regulate"those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce," 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30, does not extend to allow federal regulation of gun possessionnear schools, even assuming congressional findings that guns have been shippedin interstate commerce and that their presence near children or in schools hasultimately affected education and productivity nationally.  The subject of gunpossession near schools was one that might well call for regulation, the Courtpointed out, but that decision was for the States to make.</tt><p><tt>	The Lopez Court, in striking down the federal prohibition of gunpossession near schools, emphasized that "defining and enforcing the criminallaw" was primarily a function of the States.  115 S. Ct. at 1631 n.3.See id. at 1626 ("The powers delegated... tothe federal government are few and defined.  Those which are to remain in theState governments are numerous and indefinite.") (quoting The Federalist No.45 292-93(James Madison) (C. Rossiter ed., 1961)).  </tt><p><tt>	Similarly, any attempt by Congress to set federal rules for sales ofcigarettes within the States would exceed the powers granted to the federalgovernment and, as in Lopez, invade those reserved to the States.</tt>"#fn86" [30  <p>]<h2>B.		Tenth Amendment</h2><p><tt>	The Tenth Amendment serves as an independent brake on broad assertions offederal power that would interfere with areas of sovereignty traditionallyreserved to the States.  The authority of Congress to legislate in such areas"is an extraordinary power" and "a power that we must assume Congress does notexercise lightly."  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460(1991).  Congress did not exercise it here.  </tt><p><tt>	The Tenth Amendment can itself be a bar to federal legislation in areas ofintimate state concern.  "[T]he Tenth Amendment confirms that the power of theFederal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reservepower to the States.  The Tenth Amendment thus directs us todetermine... whether an incident of state sovereignty isprotected by a limitation on an Article I power."  New York v. UnitedStates, 505 U.S. 144, 157 (1992).</tt><p><tt>	Decisions about eligibility and maturity have traditionally been left tothe States, which have never resolved them identically.  States have decidedthe ages at which young persons may vote, serve on juries, drive automobiles,marry, enter binding contracts, testify, drink various kinds of alcoholicbeverages, and use tobacco products.  The policies set by the States on suchissues have varied.  A constitutional amendment was necessary to establish anationally uniform minimum voting age.  U.S. Const. amend. XXVI, becauseCongress did not have power to set a minimum age for State elections.Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 118 (1970).  When the federalgovernment sought to influence the minimum drinking age, as noted, it did soindirectly through conditional grants of federal highway funds; it did notattempt to dictate policy from the national level.  See SouthDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).</tt><p><tt>	FDA seeks to legislate a national minimum sales age for tobacco, which isan issue traditionally regulated by the states.  At the very least, Congress isrequired by the Tenth Amendment to speak clearly in the text of legislationwhen it wishes to invade or displace traditional State functions.  "[I]fCongress intends to alter the 'usual constitutional balance between the Statesand the Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so 'unmistakablyclear in the language of the statute.'"  Willv. Michigan Dep'tof State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989) (quoting Atascadero StateHosp.v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985)).  </tt><p><tt>	Determining the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco is a traditionalfunction of the States.  See, e.g., Act of July10,1901, 1901 Pa. Laws 638 (prohibiting the sale of "tobacco, in any form," to aperson under the age of 16).  The FDCA and its amendments do not containany statement empowering FDA to supplant or even supplement State powerin this area, and certainly do not contain the clear statement required by theTenth Amendment.  </tt><p><tt>	In its preamble to the proposed regulations, FDA argues for "constru[ing]the device definition broadly."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,347.  This self-aggrandizingapproach ignores the Tenth Amendment's requirement of explicit authorization.It flies in the face, moreover, of Congress' repeated rejection of regulationof cigarettes at all by FDA and of the very controls that FDA now proposes, andis inconsistent with Congress' affirmative recognition of State authority inthe ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992. </tt><p><tt>	The legislative branch has thus spoken on this issue, and FDA is trying tooverride the result it reached.</tt><p><tt></tt><h2>C.	  Ninth Amendment</h2><p><tt>	The Bill of Rights was adopted not only to make clear that Congress wasprohibited from legislating in certain ways and on certain subjects.  The NinthAmendment was included to make clear that the listing of prohibitions onfederal legislation is not exclusive-- that simply from the fact that aprohibition is not spelled out, federal power does not exist to legislate onall other subjects.  "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."U.S. Const. amend. IX.</tt><p><tt>	Tobacco was familiar and widely used in the States prior to theConstitution, and the notion that the federal government could restrict who maysmoke would surely have amazed the Founders.  The Ninth Amendment did notrestrict the States, whose regulations are not at issue here.  Barron v.Baltimore, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243, 247-48 (1833).  But whatever its reach,and whatever its applicability to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,the Ninth Amendment is an additional barrier to federal laws that wouldrestrict freedom of adults as well as others to use tobacco products.Cf. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484 (1965);see also id. at 486-94 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren,C.J., and Brennan, J., concurring); cf. also Hodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 447 (1990); Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 579 n.15 (1980) (plurality);Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 737 (1984) (Stevens, J.,concurring) (Ninth Amendment "goes to the very core of the constitutionalrelationship between the individual and governmental authority and, indeed,between sovereigns exercising authority over the individual."). </tt><p><tt><b>	COMMENTS ON FDA'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS:</b></tt><p><tt><b>	PART 897</b></tt><p><tt>	<b>     SUBPARTA--GENERAL PROVISIONS     </b></tt><p><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>[[section]] 897.1--Scope</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section897(a) states that Part 897 is intended "to establish theconditions" under which cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products shall be"sold, distributed, or used" under the restricted device and other provisionsof the FDCA.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	As discussed above in VolumeV, SectionC, FDA does not haveauthority to regulate cigarettes under the restricted device (or any other)provision of the FDCA.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]] 897.2--Purpose</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.2 states that FDA's purpose in establishing conditionsfor the sale, distribution, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoproducts is to reduce the number of individuals under the age of 18 who become"addicted to nicotine," and to provide "important information" regardingtobacco use to "users and potential users."</tt>"#fn87" [31<p>]<p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	As discussed in detail in these comments, the proposed rules will havelittle effect on tobacco use by young people, are beyond FDA's statutoryauthority, are unjustified as a matter of policy, and would violate theConstitution.

Reg.41,348.</tt><p><p><tt>	FDA does not describe the "evidence" to which it refers; in fact, therecord is barren of evidence regarding RYO tobacco.  FDA's profferedjustifications for asserting jurisdiction over cigarettes, moreover, do notapply to RYO tobacco.  FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over RYO tobacco isarbitrary and capricious.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]] 897.3(c)--Distributor</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.3(c) defines "distributor" to mean--</tt><p><tt>"any person who furthers the marketing of cigarettes or smokeless tobaccoproducts, whether domestic or imported, at any point from the original place ofmanufacture to the person who makes final delivery or sale to the ultimateuser, but who does not repackage or otherwise change the container, wrapper, orlabeling of the cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, or the package of thecigarettes or smokeless tobacco products."</tt><p><p><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	a.  This definition of "distributor" is unclear in at least threerespects.</tt><p><tt>	First, the meaning of the term "marketing," as used in thisdefinition, is unclear.  The term can mean any or all of the following:  (1)exposing for sale, (2) selling, (3) distributing (in the sense of physicallymoving the product from one place to another), or (4) advertising and promoting(i.e., what "marketing" departments are doing).  The scope of thedefinition of "distributor" depends on which of these activities, or whichcombination of these activities, FDA includes in the term "marketing."</tt><p><tt>	Second, the uncertainty with respect to the meaning of the term"marketing" as used in the definition (and thus the uncertainty with respect tothe scope of the proposed Section897.3(c)) is amplified when the text ofthe definition is compared to the texts of other definitions of "distributor"and related terms in FDA's regulations.  A series of related definitions inFDA's device tracking regulation, 21 C.F.R. [[section]] 821.3, provide:</tt><p><tt>"(h)  Distributor means any person who furthers thedistribution of a device from the original place of manufacture to theperson who makes delivery or sale to the ultimate user, i.e., the final ormultiple distributor....</tt><p><p><tt>"(i)  Final distributor means any person who distributes atracked device intended for use by a single patient over the useful life of thedevice to the patient.  This term includes, but is not limited to, licensedpractitioners, retail pharmacies, hospitals, and other types of device userfacilities.</tt><p><p><tt>"(j)  Distributes means any distribution of a tracked device[with certain inclusions and exclusions].</tt><p><p><tt>"(k)  Multiple distributor means any device user facility, rentalcompany, or any other entity that distributes a life-sustaining orlife-supporting device intended for use by more than one patient over theuseful life of the device."  (Emphases added.)</tt><p><p><tt>The definition of "distributor" in FDA's regulation on medical devicedistributor reporting, 21 C.F.R. [[section]] 804.3(d), provides:</tt><p><tt>"(d)  Distributor means any person, including any person who importsa device into the United States, who furthers the marketing of a devicefrom the original place of manufacture to the person who makes final deliveryor sale to the ultimate user."  (Emphasis added.)</tt><p><p><tt>Thus, in the corresponding places in the definitions of "distributor,"Section821.3(h) uses the term "distribution," whereasSection804.3(d) and Section897.3(c) use the term "marketing."  Onepossible implication of that difference in terminology is that FDA conceives of"marketing" as having a meaning that is broader than, or otherwise differentfrom, the meaning of "distribution."  The term "marketing" is not defined inSection804.3, nor in Section897.3.  Thus, the meaning of"marketing," and therefore also the meaning of "distributor" inSection804.3(d) and Section897.3(c), are unclear.</tt><p><tt>	Third, it is reasonably clear from the set of definitions inSection821.3 that the definition of "distributor" inSection821.3(h) does not include a retailer.  In Section821.3, aretailer presumably would be a "final distributor" or "multiple distributor."Whether the definitions of "distributor" in Section804.3(d) andSection897.3(c) include a retailer is unclear.  The answer to thatquestion depends, at least in part, on how the terms "furthers" and "marketing"are interpreted.  It is possible to read these words and, consequently, thesedefinitions narrowly as excluding retailers from the category of"distributors."  It is also possible, however, to read them broadly asincluding retailers as "distributors" (for example, on the ground thatretailers' promotional activities "further" the "marketing" of the article fromthe manufacturer to the retailers).</tt>"#fn90" [33<p>	b.  Assuming that Section897.3(c) is given the broadest possiblemeaning, the Agency's definition of "distributor" is manifestly overbroad.  Itmight be read to include --as persons "who further the marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoproducts" --literally everyone involved in the production, shipping, advertising orpromotion of cigarettes.  Such "distributors" could thus include, for example,cigarette manufacturers and their employees; truckers and shipping clerksinvolved in the physical movement of the product; advertising agencies; peopleinvolved in promotional activities and the manufacture of promotional materials(]<tt>e.g., race car drivers and ballet dancers in sponsoredevents); retailers and their employees; and conceivably even individuals who"deliver" cigarettes to social acquaintances or family members as "ultimateusers."  Including such persons and entities within the definition of"distributor" would, in turn, render them "responsible," underSection897.10, for ensuring that the cigarettes the "marketing" of whichthey "further" comply with "all applicable requirements" of Part 897.  Thatresult is absurd.  </tt><p><tt>	c.  Section897.3(c) is also unconstitutionally vague.  "It is abasic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if itsprohibitions are not clearly defined."  Graynedv. Rockford,408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  Clarity of definition is crucial to the noticerequirement, which is an essential part of fundamental fairness.  SeeConnallyv. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926).On the face of the definition, however, it is impossible to determine whether aperson becomes a "distributor"-- by "further[ing] the marketing" ofcigarettes-- if all that the person does is to advocate smoking,or the purchase of a particular brand of cigarettes through oralrecommendations.  "Advocacy" would seem to be within the common-sense meaningof the term "furthers."</tt>"#fn90" [34  <p>However, comprehensive, indiscriminate restrictions on such advocacy cannotsurvive First Amendment scrutiny.  ]<tt>NAACPv. Button,371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963); Nearv. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697(1931); see also Chicago Teachers Unionv.Hudson, 475 U.S. 292, 303 n.11 (1986).  </tt><p><tt>	The overbreadth and vagueness of the definition of "distributor" are notcured by reference to the subject matter and the entire text.  Indeed, theoverall nature of the proposed regulations only underscores the problematicnature of the definition:  Many of the other proposed regulations actuallycontain restrictions on expression, not merely the physical aspects ofdistribution.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction do not resolvethis vagueness problem.  Without greater clarity and specificity, thedefinition of "distributor" is unconstitutionally vague under the Due ProcessClause and the First Amendment.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]] 897.3(g)--Point of Sale</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.3(g) defines "point of sale" to mean "any location atwhich a consumer can purchase or otherwise obtain cigarettes or smokelesstobacco products for personal consumption."  </tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	Like Section897.3(b), this definition is unconstitutionally vagueand overbroad.  A person can "obtain" cigarettes from a social acquaintance ora family member in a private home or automobile or in any number of othersettings.  We assume that FDA does not intend to assert jurisdiction over, orimpose regulatory requirements with respect to, transfers of cigarettes betweenindividuals in private homes or other private settings.  Point of saleshould be limited to commercial establishments where tobacco products aresold in arm's-lengthcommercial transactions.  Any attempt by FDA to regulate other transfers wouldraise a host of constitutional, statutory, policy and practical issues.  Suchattempted regulation would, for example, violate the constitutional right toprivacy, as well as exceed the Agency's jurisdiction under the FDCA.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]] 897.3(h)--Retailer</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.3(h) defines "retailer" to mean "any person who sells ordistributes cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products to individuals forpersonal consumption."  </tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	This definition is similarly vague and overbroad.  Under this definition,a manufacturer or wholesaler that "distributes" complimentary cigarettes to itsemployees, or to guests at a private function, would be a "retailer," as wouldbe any individual who gives any other individual a cigarette.  The definitionalso might be construed to cover a cigarette manufacturer that gives cigarettesto business guests visiting its premises or to employees.  So broad adefinition of "retailer" would cause FDA's proposed regulatory scheme toviolate the constitutional right of privacy, and to exceed the Agency'sjurisdiction under the FDCA.</tt><p><tt><b>	COMMENTS ON FDA'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS:</b></tt><p><tt><b>	PART897</b></tt><p><tt><b>	SUBPARTB--SALE AND DISTRIBUTION</b></tt><p><tt><b>	    TO PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE   </b></tt><p><p><p><tt><b>[[section]]897.10--General Responsibilities ofManufacturers,</b></tt><p><tt><b>          Distributors, and Retailers               </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section897.10 would make each manufacturer, distributor, andretailer "responsible for ensuring that the cigarettes or smokeless tobaccoproducts it manufactures, labels, advertises, packages, distributes, sells, orotherwise holds for sale comply with all applicable requirements" ofPart897.  The commentary in the preamble on the proposed ruleacknowledges the extraordinary breadth of this provision.  It states that"[p]erhaps the most significant effect of the proposed rule with regard topotential legal liability is that manufacturers, as well as retailers anddistributors, could be held responsible for violations of the regulations."  60Fed.

It would seem to hold manufacturers and theiremployees legally responsible for ensuring that retailers comply with thehand-to-hand transaction requirement of Section897.14(b) and theprohibition against selling or distributing cigarettes from opened packages setforth in Section897.14(c).  It also would seem, for example, to requiremanufacturers and their employees to ensure that retailers comply withSection897.16(b)-(d),which would prohibit retailers from selling or distributing cigarette packagescontaining fewer than 20 in number, from selling in other than face-to-facetransactions, and from giving away free samples.  Finally, the regulation wouldseem to require manufacturers and their employees to ensure that retailerscomply with Section897.34(b), which would prohibit retailers fromoffering any "gift or item" to any person purchasing cigarettes inconsideration of furnishing evidence (such as proofs-of-purchaseor coupons) of such a purchase.</tt><p><tt>	Section897.10, if interpreted as drafted, appears to have the effectof subjecting manufacturers and their employees to civil or criminal liabilitybased on the failure of other persons (distributors and retailers) to complywith their obligations under the regulations.  The regulation would thus go farbeyond well-established limits on vicarious liability and strict criminalliability.  It is unauthorized by law and unconstitutional.</tt>"#fn91" [35<p>]<h3>1.		Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</h3><tt>	There is no authority in the FDCA for the vicarious liability that wouldbe imposed under Section897.10.  Nothing in the FDCA makes one partyliable for the acts of another, except where the first party has "caused" theviolation to occur.  Section301 of the FDCA, which sets forth the actsprohibited by the statute, states explicitly that "the following acts andthe causing thereof are prohibited."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]331(emphasis added).  Under Section301, a manufacturer cannot be heldlegally responsible for violations it did not cause, and which were committedby individuals or entities over which it had no legal or practicalauthority.</tt><p><tt>	An individual who violates the FDCA is potentially subject to criminalprosecution.  However, there is no precedent for the criminal liability thatFDA proposes in Section897.10.  To be convicted of a criminal violationof the FDCA, the defendant must have had at least a "responsible relationship"to the violation and must have had the authority to prevent the violation fromoccurring.  See United Statesv. Park, 421 U.S. 658,672 (1975) (holding that liability for offenses committed by a corporationextends to "those corporate agents [who are] vested with the responsibility,and power commensurate with that responsibility, to devise whatever measuresare necessary to ensure compliance with the Act [and thus] bear a `responsiblerelationship' to, or have a `responsible share' in, violations").  Although theFDCA has been held by the Supreme Court to impose on individuals strictliability, it does not impose on any person --corporate or individual --vicarious liability.  To extend liability where no "responsible relationship"exists would be to extend criminal liability well beyond the limits ofPark and the general law respecting vicarious liability.  </tt><p><tt>	Under the text of the FDCA, a party may be held civilly or criminallyliable for a violation only in three circumstance:  where the party (1)personally committed the violation (FDCA [[section]]301, 21U.S.C.[[section]]331), (2) personally caused the violation (FDCA[[section]]301, 21U.S.C. [[section]]331), or (3) had a"responsible relationship" to the violation as a result of the party'sauthority within an organization.  United States v. Park, 421U.S. 658, 672 (1975).  The first two circumstances apply to individuals ororganizations.  The third circumstance applies only to individuals.  Therationale of the Park doctrine has no relevance to the liability of anorganization; the doctrine has never been used against, and hasnever been thought to apply to, an organization.</tt><p><tt>	Under the FDCA as a matter of general principle, the liability of anorganization for committing or causing a violation depends solely andexclusively on the doctrine of respondeat superior.  Corporationsdo not act, and do not become subject to liability, through the acts ofindividuals or organizations who are not their employees, agents, orinstrumentalities.  "[T]he only way in which a corporation can act is throughthe individuals who act on its behalf."  United States v.Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 281 (1943) (emphasis added).  There isnothing in the text or legislative history of the FDA to suggest that Congressintended any different principle of corporate liability to apply or thatCongress intended to authorize FDA to make any different principle of corporateliability apply.</tt><p><tt>	A corporation is legally responsible only for acts of its employees,agents, or instrumentalities that occur in the course of their employment oragency or instrumental relationship and that are intended to benefit thecorporation.  See generally, e.g., KeatonW.P.Prosser &amp; Keaton on the Law of Torts [[section]][[section]]69-71(5th ed. 1984).</tt><p><tt>	The limitation of the bases of an organization's liability for the acts ofits employees, agents, and instrumentalities has deep roots in the common lawand in the principles of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due ProcessClause.  The broad expansion of corporate liability apparently proposed by FDAis flatly contrary to that doctrine and those principles.  Before anadministrative agency can take action so contrary to the basic norms of ourlegal system, it must have clearly expressed authorization from Congress.  FDAhas no such authorization here.</tt><p><tt>	FDA purports to find authority for the violations it would create in theFDCA's misbranding provision:</tt><p><tt>"Under section502(q)(2) of the [FDCA], a restricted device that issold, distributed, or used in violation of regulations prescribed undersection520(e) of the [FDCA] shall be deemed to be misbranded.  Therefore,nicotine-containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products that are marketedin violation of the proposed rule would be regarded by FDA as misbranded."  60Fed. Reg. 41,352.</tt><p><p><tt>	Causing a drug or device to be misbranded, or shipping a misbranded drugor device in interstate commerce, is a strict liability offense under the FDCA.21 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]331(a)-(c),(k), 333(a)(1).  See Park, 421 U.S. at 672-73 (criminal liabilitydoes not turn on awareness of some wrongdoing or conscious fraud) (citingUnited Statesv. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943));Novickiv. Cook, 946 F.2d 938, 942 (D.C. Cir. 1991)(Park determined that FDCA creates strict-liabilityoffenses for corporate officer).</tt><p><tt>	FDA, therefore, purports to create a new theory of vicarious liability,and to expand strict liability under the FDCA, through an increasinglyattenuated chain of statutory-regulatory propositions: (1)cigarettes area device; (2)misbranding of devices causes the devices to violate theFDCA; (3)sales to minors, sales by vending machines, sales from siteswith noncomplying displays, and sales that otherwise violate the proposedregulations, are all forms of misbranding; (4)manufacturers and theirofficers and employees should be held responsible for the actions or inactionsof retailers and their employees; therefore, (5)manufacturers can be heldvicariously liable for those actions or inactions, and officers and employeesof manufacturers can be held strictly liable for those actions or inactions --indeed, they can be sent to prison, even if they knew nothing about the actionsor inactions and had no authority to control them.</tt><p><tt>	This elongated chain of propositions, leading to vicarious civil liabilityor even criminal liability, is unprecedented and unsupportable under the FDCAor accepted legal principles.  The existence of a form of misbranding under theFDCA provides no statutory basis for the new classes of liability FDA purportsto create.  </tt><p><tt>	In addition, by requiring that tobacco manufacturers "ensure" thatretailers comply with its rules, FDA has impermissibly imposed on manufacturersnew legal responsibilities-- enforcement responsibilities.  Not only isthe delegation of such governmental responsibilities to private entitiesgenerally disfavored, but, in this instance, Congress has not authorized FDA toso delegate its enforcement responsibilities.  Even if Congress had done so,this particular delegation would be clearly excessive.  </tt><p><tt>	The FDCA does not authorize FDA to delegate its enforcementresponsibilities to private entities.  The FDCA grants the Secretary of Healthand Human Services the authority to conduct investigations "through officersand employees of the Department [of Health and Human Services] or through anyhealth, food, or drug officer or employee of anyState...duly commissioned by the Secretary as anofficer of the Department."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]372(a).  The FDCA alsoprovides that all proceedings to restrain violations of the Act must be broughtby the United States (or, in limited circumstances, by a State).  21 U.S.C.[[section]]337.  These provisions demonstrate that Congress contemplatedthe appropriate delegation of enforcement authority and even delegated some ofthat authority outside HHS.  However, no provision of the statute allowsfor delegation of enforcement responsibility to private entities.  When, as inthe FDCA, Congress has enacted a specific and detailed enforcement scheme,alternative schemes may not be created by implication.  SeeMassachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134,146-48(1985); Middlesex County Sewerage Auth.v. National Sea ClammersAss'n, 453 U.S. 1, 14-15(1981).  Furthermore, courts are reluctant to read into statutes broadauthority to delegate, absent clear proof of legislative intent to do so.See, e.g., Assiniboine and Sioux Tribesv.Board of Oil&amp; Gas, 792 F.2d 782, 796 (9th Cir. 1986).  FDA hasoffered no such proof of legislative intent.  By delegating enforcementresponsibility to private parties, Section897.10 exceeds FDA's statutoryauthority.</tt>"#fn94" [36<p>]<h3>2.		Unconstitutional</h3><tt>	Holding a cigarette manufacturer liable for the acts of retailers ordistributors-- who are neither agents nor employees of the manufacturer,and over whom the manufacturer has no legal or practical authority--violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  </tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court has held that a corporation's authority to deterwrongdoing by its agents and employees also establishes the constitutionallimits on imposing vicarious criminal liability on corporations.  In NewYork Cent.&amp; Hudson River R.R. Co.v. United States,212 U.S. 481 (1909), the Court applied the "principle governing civilliability" in holding that a corporation may be held criminally liable for theacts of an agent committed within the scope of employment pursuant to authoritydelegated by the corporation.  Id. at 494.  The Court reasoned thatimposing such liability for the crimes of those in whom the company "entrustedauthority to act" was necessary to ensure that corporations complied with thelaw.  Id. at 495-96.  Accord United Statesv.Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000, 1004 (9th Cir. 1972) (holdingCongress may constitutionally impose criminal liability on a business entityfor acts or omissions of its agents within the scope of their employment),cert. denied sub nom. Western Int'l HotelsCo.v. United States, 409 U.S. 1125 (1973).  Thus, vicariouscorporate liability is limited to respondeat superiorliability.</tt>"#fn94" [37<p>	As we show in more detail in the comments on Section897.12(b), cigarettemanufacturers have no legal power or authority over their customers --whether the customers are consumers, retailers, distributors or wholesalers --such as to provide a basis for FDA's proposed system of vicarious liability.They have not "entrusted authority to act" in them.  <p>	We know of no case in which vicarious liability was imposed on a corporationfor the acts of persons over whom it had no authority or control-- thatis, where the corporation had no legal authority to deter, prevent or remedythe violation or to punish the perpetrator.  That, however, is the very type ofvicarious liability that Section897.10 evidently would impose.<p>	Nor do the existing regulations cited by FDA in support ofSection897.10, ]<tt>see 60 Fed. Reg. 41,352, 41,474, offer anyprecedent for FDA's effort to establish the vicarious liability of cigarettemanufacturers with respect to entities and persons not acting under theirauthority or control.  Far from holding manufacturers responsible for allviolations committed by distributors and retailers, those regulations imposeadditional duties on manufacturers only to modify their products (as labeled)in response to the actions of others.  See, e.g., 21C.F.R. [[section]]201.128 (requiring a manufacturer to provide labelingof additional "intended uses" of drugs where it "knows, or has knowledge offacts that would give [it] notice," of additional claims made by distributorsand retailers); id. [[section]]801.4 (same requirement fordevices).</tt><p><tt>	Strict criminal liability under the FDCA permits an individual to be heldliable without proof of participation in, or knowledge of, the offense.  Suchliability without the traditional requirement of "mens rea,"however, is not vicarious.  It may constitutionally be imposed onlywhere the government proves that the defendant had "responsibility andauthority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly [to] correct,the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so."  Park, 421U.S. 658 at 674.</tt><p><tt>	The facts of Park illustrate the type of proof that is required.In Park, the government relied principally on two types of evidence:(1)evidence that violations had occurred, and (2)evidence of Park'sauthority (not merely his power) within the corporation.  The Supreme Courtdescribed the second kind of evidence as follows:</tt><p><tt>"The Government's final witness, Acme's vice president for legal affairsand assistant secretary, identified [Park] as the president and chief executiveofficer of the company and read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chiefexecutive officer.7/  He testified that respondent functioned bydelegating `normal operating duties,' including sanitation, but that heretained `certain things, which are the big, broad, principles of the operationof the company,' and had `the responsibility of seeing that they all worktogether.'"  </tt><p><p><tt>7/  "The bylaw provided in pertinent part:</tt><p><p><tt>	'The Chairman of the board of directors or the president shall be thechief executive officer of the company as the board of directors may from timeto time determine.  He shall, subject to the board of directors, have generaland active supervision of the affairs, business, offices and employees of thecompany....</tt><p><p><tt>	'He shall, from time to time, in his discretion or at the order of theboard, report the operations and affairs of the company.  He shall also performsuch other duties and have such other powers as may be assigned to him fromtime to time by the board of directors.'"  421 U.S. at 662-63 n.7.  </tt><p><p><tt>	As summarized and relied on by the Court, this evidence did not deal withPark's de facto influence among the employees of Acme, but ratherwith his legal authority over the employees and operations of thecorporation, as that authority was defined and assigned by the organic documentof the corporation.</tt><p><tt>	The Court in Park, summarizing decisions holding corporateofficials criminally liable without mens rea, observed:  "It wasenough in such cases that, by virtue of the relationship he bore to thecorporation, the agent had the power to prevent the act complained of."Id. at 671 (emphasis added).  The Court's reference to "power" was areference to power derived from "the relationship he bore to thecorporation"-- i.e., his authority.  The Court reiteratedthis point:  </tt><p><tt>"The requirements of foresight and vigilance imposed on responsiblecorporate agents... are no more stringent than the public hasa right to expect of those who voluntarily assume positions of authorityin business enterprises whose services and products affect the health and well-beingof the public that supports them."  Id. at 672 (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>The Court also stated:</tt><p><tt>"[T]he Government establishes a prima facie case when it introducesevidence sufficient to warrant a finding by the trier of facts that thedefendant had, by reason of his position in the corporation, responsibility andauthority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct,the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so.  The failure tofulfill the duty imposed by the interaction of the corporate agent'sauthority and the statute furnishes a sufficient causallink....  </tt><p><p><tt>	"Reading the entire charge [to the jury] satisfies us that the jury'sattention was adequately focused on the issue of respondent's authoritywith respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the allegedviolations."  Id. at 673-74(emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>	Strict liability under the FDCA, therefore, cannot be imposed where theprincipal has no legal power or authority over the violator or the transactionresulting in the violation.  Park, 421 U.S. at 673 (criminal liabilitywill not attach to corporate officer who is "powerless" to prevent or correctFDCA violation).  </tt><p><tt>	There is no document analogous to corporate bylaws that gives cigarettemanufacturers or their officers and employees authority to direct the conductof retailers or others in the distribution chain, or their employees, such thatthe Park doctrine would be applicable.  Park and its progenyprovide no support whatsoever for the liability proposed inSection897.10.</tt><p><tt>	In the jurisdictional analysis accompanying its proposed regulations, FDAasserts that the FDCA "imposes a strict liability standard...and assesses criminal liability even where there is no evidence of actualknowledge of the alleged conduct on the part of the corporate defendant.  60Fed. Reg. 41,473-74 (citing 21 U.S.C. [[section]]331; Park, 421U.S. at 670-73; United Statesv. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277,280-81 (1943)).  </tt><p><tt>	FDA states only one portion of the well-establishedstandard-- that strict liability crimes dispense with the traditionalrequirement of mens rea.  The Agency fails to mention thatPark and its progeny sanction the elimination of mens reaonly where the defendant stands in a responsible relation to the offense.  FDAdoes not cite a single case-- and we are aware of none-- thatsuggests that vicarious liability may be imposed on manufacturers, or thatstrict liability may be imposed on corporate officers where (1)they haveno legal authority over the violator, (2)they have no practicalability to deter, prevent or remedy the violations, or (3)the violatoracts for his own interest, not theirs.  To the contrary, if any one of thesethree conditions applies, there can be no liability.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to do here precisely what Park and its progenyprohibit:  to impose vicarious (and strict) liability on manufacturers andtheir officers and employees even where they have no legal authority to"prevent or correct" the violation.  Park, 421 U.S. at 673.  This strictliability provision thus would criminalize many circumstances in which it wouldbe literally impossible for the manufacturer's representative to prevent aretailer's infraction.  </tt><p><tt>	The legal authority to prevent or deter cannot be presumed, as FDA woulddo here:  "The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments setlimits upon the power ... to make the proof of one fact or group offacts evidence of the existence of the ultimate fact on which guilt ispredicated."  Totv. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 467(1943).  As one commentator has recently observed, "due process does not permitthe prosecution of an individual who can assert an objective impossibilitydefense."</tt>"#fn103" [38  Imposition of strictliability in a setting in which the liable party has no authority to preventthe infraction is utterly arbitrary because of the complete lack of connectionbetween the acts violative of the proposed law and the ultimate fact presumed(that the manufacturer or its officers or employees had a responsible relationto that sale).  Such a "presumption cannot be sustained if there be no rationalconnection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed."]<tt>Tot 319 U.S. at467-68.  There is no rational connectionhere, and imposing strict liability under these circumstances denies dueprocess.</tt><p><tt>	In short, Section897.10 would impose both vicarious liability onmanufacturers for acts of retailers and others without requiring thatmanufacturers exercise any authority over retailers' performance of theoffending acts, and strict criminal liability on the manufacturers and theirofficers and employees for conduct for which they did not stand in aresponsible relation.  Only one conclusion can be drawn fromSection897.10:  "[T]he real objective [of the regulation] is tostrengthen the arbitrary hand of the agency."  Amoco Oil Co.v.EPA, 543 F.2d 270, 275 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1976).  This proposed expansionof liability violates the Due Process Clause.</tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]]897.12--Additional Responsibilities ofManufacturers</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.12 would impose on manufacturers, in addition to theirother obligations under Part897, two further sets ofresponsibilities.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.12(a)--Removal of NoncomplyingItems</b></tt><p><tt>	This rule would require each manufacturer to remove, from each point ofsale, all manufacturer-ownedor manufacturer-supplieditems that do not comply with the requirements of Part897.  Under therule, manufacturers apparently would be required, inter alia, toseize and remove noncomplying display racks, clocks, and shopping carts, and toscrape noncomplying decals off doors, windows and cash registers, at retailstores, gas stations and the many other commercial establishments wherecigarettes are customarily sold.</tt>"#fn104" [39  <p>	Section897.12(a) thus would require manufacturers to enter upon thepremises of others and to seize property owned by and/or in the possession ofothers.  Moreover, unlike the inspection requirement of Section897.12(b),discussed below, the removal requirement of Section897.12(a) apparentlywould apply to manufacturers ]<tt>whether or not they visit theparticular retail location as part of their normal course of business, andwhether or not they visit retail locations at all in their normal courseof business.</tt>"#fn104" [40  <p>]<p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.12(a) plainly exceeds FDA's statutory authority.  UnderSection502(q) of the FDCA, a restricted device is misbranded if "it issold, distributed, or used in violation of regulations prescribed undersection520(e)."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(q).  Even if FDA hadauthority to regulate cigarettes as restricted medical devices (and it doesnot), and even if the format and content restrictions proposed for advertisingand labeling were within FDA's authority under Section520(e) (and theyare not), FDA still would have no authority to promulgate a regulationrequiring manufacturers to remove noncomplying promotional materials or otheritems that are present at points of sale.  FDA's only options to effect theremoval from commerce of "misbranded" cigarettes would be (1)torequest a voluntary recall (including a field correction of thelabeling), or (2)to recommend that the Department of Justice initiate anenforcement action under the FDCA, including seizure of the cigarettes orinjunction against future distribution of the misbranded items.  Compelledremoval of noncomplying promotional items is not a remedy available to FDAunder the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	The proposed requirement of removal of noncomplying items cannot beimposed as equivalent to the recall of a product or of its labeling.  FDA hasno general authority to order a recall.  The recall regulations in 21 C.F.R.Part7 are voluntary guidelines, not enforceable requirements.  The courtshave long held that the FDCA does not grant FDA general authority to requirerecalls of FDA-regulated products.  See, e.g., UnitedStatesv. C.E.B. Prods., Inc., 380 F.Supp. 664, 671-72(N.D. Ill. 1974).</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, FDA itself has no authority under the FDCA to remove, from thechannels of commerce, labeling that causes drugs or devices to becomeviolative, or the violative drugs or devices themselves.  Thus, FDA may not byregulation impose such a requirement on manufacturers.  Moreover, as explainedbelow, the promotional materials and other items at issue are notlabeling.</tt><p><tt>	In the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 ("SMDA"), Congress granted FDAspecific authority to require the recall of a medical device in certaincircumstances.  However, the recall authority conferred in the SMDA applies todevices, not to promotional or other items.  Moreover, that authoritycan be invoked only by issuance of an order, after an opportunity for aninformal hearing.  A removal regulation, like in Section897.12(a), wouldeliminate the statutorily prescribed opportunity for an individualized hearing.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, FDA may order a recall only after finding "that there is areasonable probability that a device intended for human use would cause seriousadverse health consequences or death."  FDCA [[section]]518(e)(1), 21U.S.C. [[section]]360h(e)(1).  On the one hand, FDA believes that allcigarettes meet this standard.  Thus, to invoke the mandatory recall authorityof Section518(e) would be tantamount to a ban on cigarettes for adultsmokers, an outcome that Congress clearly has never intended and that FDA haspurportedly rejected.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349 ("a ban would not be inthe best interest of the public health at this time").</tt><p><tt>	On the other hand, FDA cannot promulgate a regulation that presupposesthat a noncomplying statement on a display rack, clock or store window decal ona gas station causes the cigarettes dispensed at that gas station to present"serious health consequences", as opposed to cigarettes at a gas stationwithout any noncomplying statements.</tt><p><tt>	Section520(e) likewise provides no basis for imposing the proposedrequirements.  See generally VolumeV, SectionC,supra.  Section520(e) authorizes FDA to "require that a device berestricted to sale, distribution, or use" upon conditions designed to provide"reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness."  Requiring cigarettemanufacturers to remove promotional materials and other items from a point ofsale is neither designed nor intended to provide reasonable assurance of thesafety (or effectiveness) of any cigarettes for anyone who smokes them.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, FDA has no authority to require a manufacturer to remove from apoint of sale materials or items that the manufacturer does not own.  Thus, FDAcannot impose a requirement governing materials that are "manufacturer-supplied"but not manufacturer-owned. Manufacturer-supplied materials as to which ownership has passed to theretailer are no longer the manufacturer's property or responsibility.  Wherethe materials were lawful when provided, the manufacturer neither committed norcaused a violation of the FDCA at the time the materials were supplied forretail use.  Therefore, there is no legal basis for FDA to require amanufacturer to remove previously distributed items that FDA newly declares tobe noncomplying with previously nonexistent prohibitions.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the preamble to the proposed rule states that the removalprovisions also require manufacturers to remove "distributor-supplieditems."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,323 (emphasis added).  The additional burdenreferenced in the preamble is unexplained.  It does not matter whether somematerials owned by a retailer were supplied by a manufacturer ordistributor.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has no authority to compel manufacturers to become thieves ortrespassers, or to impose upon them the duties of unpaid police.  As we haveshown in our comments on Section 897.10, FDA has no authority under the FDCA toimpose-- and is barred by the Constitution from imposing--liability on manufacturers for violations committed by retailers.  There is nolegal basis for imposing vicarious liability for violations in whichmanufacturers had no role, and that were committed by persons over whommanufacturers had no authority and who also were not acting on their behalf orfor their benefit.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal of a recall-like,affirmative corrective program to remove promotional materials for cigarettesgoes to an extreme not previously encountered in FDA practice.  Indeed, it hasbeen standard FDA practice in imposing new labeling requirements to permitcontinued distribution of products that are on retail shelves, indistributions, or in inventory, and were manufactured before imposition of thenew requirement.</tt>"#fn107" [41  These noncompliantgoods are routinely left unaffected by the new requirement.  The retroactiveeffect of Section897.12(a) is contrary to this established FDA practice.It is also particularly inappropriate where the marketplace contains"noncomplying" materials only because the product at issue has never previouslybeen regulated by FDA at all, and the materials at issue have been in themarketplace, in compliance with applicable federal requirements, for decades.<p>	Moreover, even if FDA had the authority to regulate the activities ofretailers of cigarettes, and the authority to require the removal ordestruction of display racks, clocks, etc. --which it does not --its regulation should require such action solely by the retailers.  The Agencywould thereby avoid the potential for hostile encounters between manufacturers'representatives and retailers and the constitutional problems raised byimposing the removal duty on manufacturers.  <p>	In sum, any requirement that would make the cigarette manufacturersresponsible for removing materials from points of sale is unlawful.<p>	Section 897.12(a) is also unfair.  FDA places the number of retail outletsthat sell tobacco products over the counter at between 490,000 and 600,000.  60Fed. Reg. 41,365.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration ("SAMHSA"), relying on data from the 1992 Statistical Abstractof the United States, places the number at closer to one million.42  The largernumber presumably includes outlets that sell tobacco products but are notclassified as retail outlets in the sources relied upon by FDA.  If SAMSHA'sestimate is correct, then FDA has radically underestimated the costs and otherburdens of compliance with its proposed rules.  Even if the Agency's "smaller"number is correct, the burden of compliance would be staggering.  <p>	Dispatching employees to each of one half-million to one million retailoutlets to remove noncomplying items under Section897.12(a) would be amonumental task for any cigarette manufacturer.  For the smaller manufacturers,it would be a practical impossibility.  FDA "projects" that the manufacturerswould have to expend between $15million and $28million to removenoncomplying items.  60Fed. Reg. 41,359.  As shown in Volumes X and XI,]<tt>infra, FDA's estimates are absurdly low.  Among other things,they do not take account of innumerable labor-intensive activities such asdisconnecting wires from electrical fixtures, removing noncomplying decals fromwindows and doors, or disposing of noncomplying items, or workers' compensationand other liability costs.  The true burdens that the removal requirement wouldimpose on the manufacturers have been evaluated by independent experts and areaddressed in VolumesX and XI of these Comments, as is FDA's analysis ofthose burdens.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA blithely asserts that the requirement of Section897.12(a)"should not impose a significant burden on [the larger] manufacturers" because"the manufacturers are heavily involved in establishing and maintainingretailers' displays."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,323.</tt>"#fn109" [43  This is a ]<tt>nonsequitur.  Nothing in the display plans cited by FDA gives themanufacturer the right to remove the display.  Moreover, the fact that amanufacturer may be closely involved in establishing and maintaining retaildisplays does not give the manufacturer a possessory interest.  Obviously,"close involvement" does not establish that every retail outlet and gas stationis regularly visited by cigarette company representatives.  Nor can FDA merelyassume that manufacturers have, or decree that they shall have, authority toenter upon and remove another person's property. </tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.12(b)--Inspection and Compliance</b></tt><p><tt>	This rule would require that each manufacturer, through itsrepresentatives, whenever those representatives visit any point of sale intheir normal course of business, "visually inspect and ensure that the[sic] products are labeled, advertised, and distributed inaccordance with this part."  (Emphases added.)  Thepreamble is quite explicit about what this would entail:</tt><p><tt>"The manufacturer is responsible... for visuallyinspecting each retail establishment during any visit to such establishment, toensure that the [sic] products are appropriately labeled, advertised, and sold,or distributed.  Thus manufacturer inspections would be required during everybusiness visit to a tobacco-sellingoutlet by a manufacturer's representative."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,365.</tt><p><p><tt>FDA further notes that "[e]ach manufacturer's representative would have toreceive training on the requirements of the regulation and the new monitoringresponsibilities of their position."  Id. at 41,366.</tt><p><tt>	Section897.12(b) thus apparently would require tobacco manufacturersto police the retail outlets visited by their representatives.  A manufacturer(and the representative individually) presumably could be held civilly orcriminally liable for failing to ensure, for example, that a salesclerk doesnot sell cigarettes without demanding proof of age from a prospective purchaser(contrary to Section897.14(a)), sell cigarettes from opened packages(contrary to Section897.14(c)), keep tobacco products in a place directlyaccessible to customers or offer tobacco products for sale through a vendingmachine (contrary to Section897.16(c)), or offer gifts or other items inconsideration of the purchase of cigarettes (contrary toSection897.34(b)).</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the proposed regulation, as drafted, does not limit theresponsibilities of a manufacturer to ensuring compliance with respect to themanufacturer's own products.  The manufacturer's inspectionresponsibility is defined not in terms of "its products" but rather interms of "the products."  The rule thus could be read to require amanufacturer (and its representatives) to ensure compliance with respect toall brands of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products offeredfor sale or sold by the retailer.  Under such a reading, a cigarettemanufacturer (and its representatives) would be required to ensure compliancewith respect to smokeless tobacco products, and a smokeless tobacco productmanufacturer (and its representatives) would be required to ensure compliancewith respect to cigarettes.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b>  </tt><p><tt>	These controls exceed FDA's authority under the FDCA; they areunnecessary, impractical and unfair; they are also unconstitutional.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	1.</b>	<b>Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b><i></i></tt><p><tt><i></i>	There is no statutory authority for Section897.12(b), whichessentially would require manufacturers to do the job of FDA inspectors.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal also conflicts with the comprehensive statutory schemegoverning FDA inspections and related activities under Sections702, 703,and 704 of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]372-374. None of those statutory provisions authorizes FDA to require private partiesto conduct inspections of the facilities of others, or to require the owners ofthose facilities to submit to such private inspections.  HHS, and by delegationFDA, is authorized to conduct examinations and investigations underSection702 only through its own employees and through appropriatelycommissioned State and local employees.  No commissioning of private citizensis sanctioned under the FDCA.  Similarly, to make an inspection underSection704, the inspector must be an "officer or employee duly designatedby the Secretary," and in order to make a lawful entry, that person must haveappropriate FDA credentials and the authority to issue a notice of inspection.FDCA [[section]]704, 21 U.S.C. [[section]]374(a).  Cigarettemanufacturers' sales representatives are neither designated, credentialed norauthorized under the FDCA.  FDA cannot delegate inspection duties under theFDCA by promulgating regulations.  </tt><p><tt>	On those rare occasions where Congress has intended to authorize privateparties to survey facilities, it has done so explicitly.  For example, in theMammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA), 42 U.S.C.[[section]]263b, Congress required facilities that conduct mammographyactivities to provide proof of an on-site survey by a qualified medicalphysicist and certification that the facility meets the relevant qualitystandards.  Id. [[section]]263b(d)(1)(A)(iii) &amp; (f)(1)(E).The MQSA survey authority by a medical expert is radically different from thecompliance burdens FDA proposes to shift to cigarette manufacturers.  Under theMQSA, Congress did not require that anyone perform an inspection,nor did it conscript anyone into the FDA inspection business.  It merelyrequired that mammography facilities have surveys performed.  That is analogousto the SEC requiring companies to have audited financial statements.  Under theproposed regulation, by contrast, FDA is requiring manufacturers toperform inspections; it is conscripting them into the inspectionbusiness.  Even in the MQSA, Congress directed that inspections to determinecompliance should be conducted only by FDA or a State agency acting on FDA'sbehalf.  Id. [[section]]263b(g). </tt><p><tt>	FDA also lacks statutory authority for its unprecedented proposal inSection897.12(b) to require manufacturers to take on the role of an FDAcompliance officer by "ensur[ing] that... products [at apoint of sale] are labeled, advertised, and distributed in accordance with [FDArequirements]."  The FDCA imposes no duty on manufacturers of other products toensure that retailers or any other entities comply with regulatoryrequirements.  As shown in our comments on Section897.10, Congress hasnot authorized FDA to delegate its enforcement responsibilities to privateentities.  FDA cannot, by regulation, delegate those responsibilities.</tt><p><tt>	Section520(e) of the FDCA provides no such authority.  Requiringmanufacturers to "inspect" the premises of cigarette retailers cannot becharacterized as a "condition" relating to the "sale, distribution, or use" ofa medical device within the meaning of Section520(e).Section520(e) of the FDCA does not authorize FDA to conscript cigarettemanufacturers and their sales forces into doing FDA's work of law enforcement.</tt><p><tt>	The reference in Section520(e)(1)(B) to "other conditions" cannot beread as an open-endedauthority for FDA to impose whatever conditions may please its fancy.  Rather,that language must be interpreted in accordance with the principle ofejusdem generis to authorize only conditions similar in nature tothe prescription requirement authorized by Section520(e)(1)(A).Goochv. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936) (principle"limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to thosespecified").  Moreover, the legislative history of Section520(e) makes itclear that conditions similar in nature to a prescription requirement(e.g., restrictions to particular types of medical practitionersor to particular types of medical settings) are the only types of conditionsCongress intended to authorize in Section520(e)(1)(B).  SeeVolumeV, supra.  Plainly, a condition that manufacturers' salesrepresentatives become police officers or law-enforcement investigators forpurposes of enforcing the requirements that Part 897 imposes on retailers isnot similar in nature to a prescription requirement.</tt><p><tt>	The kind of authority FDA claims to have under Section520(e) isunprecedented in American law.</tt>"#fn110" [44  Weknow of no prior instance in which an administrative agency has assertedauthority to compel some private parties to perform law-enforcement functionswith respect to other private parties who were not in an employer-employeeor principal-agentrelationship with them.  Indeed, there is an Orwellian aspect to a governmentagency requiring some private parties to inspect and spy on other, independentprivate parties.  Section520(e) of the FDCA should not be read asconferring on FDA the authority to delegate its compliance oversightresponsibilities to members of a regulated industry unless Congress has madeits intention to confer such authority explicit in the text of the statute.Here, there is nothing whatever to suggest that Congress intended that FDAimplement Section520(e) by promulgating a regulation that delegates FDA'scompliance responsibilities.<p>]<p><tt><b>	2.</b>	<b>Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	The inspection responsibilities that manufacturers would berequired to shoulder under Section897.12(b) are objectionable on policygrounds for at least three reasons. </tt><p><tt>	First, sales representatives are not trained to serve as law-enforcement officers.  It is inappropriate, and potentially even dangerous, torequire them to serve that function.  In this regard, we refer FDA to the manycomments filed with SAMHSA, in connection with its proposed rules implementingSection1926 of the Public Health Service Act (see NPR, 58 Fed.Reg. 45,156 (Aug. 26, 1993)), objecting to the suggestion that undercover"sting" operations be conducted by private parties to test compliance withState minimum sales-agelaws.</tt>"#fn110" [45  Requiring manufacturers to"ensure" retailer compliance in the manner proposed by FDA would deputize salesrepresentatives as law-enforcementofficers, but without the powers of such officers, and without the legalprotections afforded to police officers and federal law enforcement agents.Efforts by thousands of sales representatives to remove violative displays inretail stores and other establishments, to prevent all sales by retailers tominors, or to prevent sales by retailers of "ones" or "fives" would certainlylead to confrontations between the manufacturers' sales/"police" force andretailers over whether certain practices or materials are violations of FDA'sregulations or not, and what remedy or relief is proper.  A manufacturer'ssales representative could not terminate the employment of a salesclerkdiscovered to have made an unauthorized sale.  The representative has noauthority to insist on an employee training program.  What if the clerkresisted the representative's efforts to remove a display set?  These issuesare very real and difficult even when encountered by authorized law-enforcementpersonnel.  FDA's efforts to deputize sales representatives are unfounded andcavalier.  Sales representatives should not be put in the untenable andprecarious position of being expected to enforce federal law under anycircumstances, but especially without the full training, tools, immunities, andprotections of law-enforcement officers.  ]<p><tt>	Second, as noted, the proposed regulation apparently doesnot limit the responsibilities of a manufacturer to its own products.  Rather,the larger manufacturers, whose representatives visit retail stores more oftenthan do the representatives of the smaller manufacturers, apparently would berequired to police retail sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoproducts on behalf of the entire industry.  This broad requirement is arbitraryand capricious, as well as patently unfair. </tt><p><tt>	Third, the inspection responsibility imposed by the rule would be amonumental burden.  FDA estimates that, after its rule took effect, tobaccoproducts still would be offered for sale at as many as 700,000 retail outlets.60 Fed. Reg. 41,365.  (This estimate assumes that the number of retail outletswill increase as a result of the vending machine ban.  As noted, supra,however, FDA's baseline estimate of the number of existing retail outlets maybe too low by half.)  FDA assumes that manufacturers' sales representativeswould need "little incremental time" to conduct "routine audits"; the Agencyestimates that "each audit would be accomplished by a relatively quickassessment that would take no more than 2 to 3 minutes."  Even on theseoptimistic assumptions, FDA estimates that the annual cost of the requiredinspections would amount to $3,250 per employee, for an annual industry costthat FDA estimates at $24million, plus another $1million fortraining costs.  Id.</tt><p><tt>	As detailed in the study by the Barents Group that accompanies thissubmission, in VolumeXI, and in the sectionof these commentsdevoted to FDA's analysis of the costs and benefits of its proposed rules,VolumeX, the real costs of FDA's proposed inspection requirements wouldvastly exceed the Agency's estimates.</tt>"#fn113" [46<p><p>]<p><tt><b>	3.</b>	<b>Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>		(a)	Holding Manufacturers Vicariously Liable for</b></tt><p><tt><b>			the Acts of Others over Whom They Have No </b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Authority Violates the Due Process Clause   </b></tt><p><p><tt>	As shown in the comments on Section897.10, holding a cigarettemanufacturer liable for the acts of persons who are not its employees, agents,or instrumentalities and over whom the manufacturer has no legal or practicalauthority, would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.Because Section 897.12(b) would require manufacturers to "ensure" thatdistributors and retailers comply with their legal obligations, that section,too, is an unconstitutional expansion of well-establishedlimits on vicarious liability.</tt><p><tt>	Retailers and distributors of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco productspurchase and resell for their own accounts the manufacturers' products.  Theyare not employees or agents or instrumentalities of manufacturers.Manufacturers, through a variety of voluntary industry initiatives, work topromote compliance by retailers with applicable state and local youth accesslaws; but manufacturers have no authority to control how those retailersconduct their businesses.  Manufacturers do not own or operate retaillocations.  They do not hire and fire the individuals who sell cigarettes tothe public, such as gas station employees, convenience store clerks, pharmacycashiers or supermarket checkout employees.  They have no authority to preventor stop retailers or their employees from violating a law or regulation.  Theyhave no authority to discipline or fire individuals if they do commit aviolation and could not force them to attend training programs designed toprevent or deter any violations.  Manufacturers are not liable for the acts ofretailers or distributors under a respondeat superior theory, anagency theory, or any other accepted vicarious liability theory.  See,e.g., Hullv. Eaton Corp., 825 F.2d 448,457-58 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (corporation not vicariously liable for the actions ofindependent dealer); Todd Farm Corp.v. Navistar Int'lCorp., 835 F.2d 1253, 1256 (8th Cir. 1987) (same).</tt>"#fn113" [47<p>	FDA cites no authority holding that vicarious liability properly may beimposed on a manufacturer for the actions of those who are not its employees,agents, or instrumentalities and over whom the manufacturer has no authority.Rather, in a futile effort to find support for the obligations that would beimposed by Section897.12(b), the Agency merely asserts that largemanufacturers "keep extremely detailed records about each retailer" and visitretailers as "part of their usual business practice."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,323.Based on those assertions, FDA makes the further startling assertion thatrequiring manufacturers to "monitor" retailers to assure the proper labeling,advertising, and distribution of its products would be "both feasible andreasonable."  ]<tt>Id.</tt><p><tt>	FDA is wrong.  Its regulations would not only create new and far-reachingresponsibilities for manufacturers (see Report of A.T. Kearney in VolumeXI); they would create responsibilities that manufacturers simply have noauthority to fulfill and therefore cannot fulfill.  </tt><p><tt>	The "usual business practice" to which FDA refers concerns instances inwhich manufacturers offer "promotional allowances" to retailers.  Pursuant to acontract, a retailer may receive monthly or yearly payments from a manufacturerfor prominently displaying that manufacturer's products, or for displayingsigns for a particular brand in certain locations in the store.  Somemanufacturers, through their field representatives, regularly visit retailoutlets and otherwise monitor compliance with the terms of the contract.  If aretailer does not fulfill his or her requirements, the retailer would notreceive the promotional allowance.  </tt><p><tt>	Obviously, just as a manufacturer can offer a promotional allowance, itmay withhold it, pursuant to contract, if the retailer fails to comply with therequirements of the promotional programs.  That, however, is a far cry from therequirements FDA now wants to impose on manufacturers.  The fact thatmanufacturers have a contractual right to monitor compliance with their ownpromotional programs does not mean that they have any authority to ensure thatretailers comply with FDA's proposed regulations.  </tt><p><tt>	Two examples demonstrate the problem.  First, unlike FDA'sinvestigators acting under Section704(a)(1) of the FDCA, manufacturers'representatives have no legal right to enter the premises of a retailer.  Eventhough retail stores are generally open to the public, if a retailer refusesentry to a manufacturer's representative, the retailer violates no law and noright of the representative, and the representative has no remedy.  Bycontrast, if a retailer refuses entry to an FDA inspector, the retailer can beprosecuted criminally.  See 21 U.S.C. [[section]]331(f).Similarly, if a retailer conditions permission to enter on an agreement by arepresentative not to perform a law-enforcementfunction, the retailer violates no law and no right of the representative, andthe representative has no remedy.</tt><p><tt>	Section 897.12(b) wholly ignores the protections afforded by the FDCA toparties whose premises are subject to inspection.  The original FDCA, enactedin 1938, did not give even FDA investigators a right of entry without consent.Rather, they were authorized to enter premises only "after first making requestand obtaining permission of the owner, operator, or custodian thereo[f]."  FDCASection704, 52 Stat. 1040, 1057 (1938).</tt>"#fn124" [48  FDA investigators were not given authorityto enter without consent until 1953.  ]<tt>See Pub. L. No.83-217,67 Stat. 476, 477 (1953) (amending Section704).</tt><p><tt>	Even today, amended Section704 authorizes inspection only afteradherence to certain statutory prerequisites:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the investigator entering must have been duly designatedby the Secretary;</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the investigator must present appropriate credentials(duly issued by FDA and in official form); and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	the investigator must present to the owner, operator, oragent in charge of the premises a written notice of inspection (in fact, a formissued by FDA).  See 21 U.S.C. [[section]]374(a).</tt><p><p><tt>	The requirement of due designation by the Secretary plainly is intended toprotect parties whose premises are entered without their consent by ensuringthat only persons with proper backgrounds, proper demeanors, and propertraining are permitted to exercise the extraordinary power to enter privatepremises without consent.  The credential requirement is plainly intended toprovide assurance that the person asserting the right to enter has, in fact,been duly designated by the Secretary.  The notice requirement is intended tomake clear that the purpose of entry is to conduct an inspection dulyauthorized by law.</tt><p><tt>	However responsible and reliable a manufacturer and its salesrepresentatives may be, no private party can create for property owners andoccupiers the protections of the provisions of Section704.  A propertyowner's trust in the Secretary (i.e., FDA) to make duedesignations, to issue credentials only to properly authorized personnel, andto require the presentation of proper notices of inspection is justified by ourdemocratic system of government, of which the Secretary and FDA are a part.  Nosimilar system applies in the private sector.  In contrast to the situationunder current Section704, owners and possessors of premises do not haveany obligation to permit entry by manufacturers' representatives for lawenforcement purposes.</tt><p><tt>	Second, without literally stationing a sales representative at thecheckout counter on a continuous basis (a large supermarket with multiplecheckout counters would presumably require multiple representatives), amanufacturer cannot fully monitor whether a retailer is complying with lawsprohibiting the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products to minors,with related laws concerning proof of age, and with miscellaneous other lawsadopted by State and local governments and incorporated into FDA regulations bySection 897.42(a).  Clearly, monitoring for the two or three minutes arepresentative may visit each week or month-- as FDA estimates themonitoring to take-- would be essentially worthless.  See VolumeXI of these comments.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cannot legitimately compel manufacturers to include in contracts withtheir customers provisions requiring the customers (and the customers'customers) to comply with FDA regulations.  Such an expansion of governmentalpower and of the vicarious liability of private parties would be unprecedentedin our law, unauthorized by Congress, unconstitutional, and dangerous.  Aregulatory requirement that a seller of a chattel impose in a contract with abuyer conditions on the resale of the chattel (even a condition limited tocompliance with law) would be an extraordinary assertion of power-- anextraordinary interference with private contracting-- by a federalagency.  If that kind of power exists, there is no principled limit on thekinds of provisions an agency could require.  The potential for interferencewith market mechanisms is enormous.</tt>"#fn124" [49<p>	FDA itself does not take action against every violation its investigatorsobserve during inspections.  Even FDA would say (]<tt>e.g.,at a congressional hearing) that it should not be held responsible forviolations committed by parties it regulates, and (e.g., in thecourts) that its individual enforcement decisions cannot be governed by anyfixed set of rules, that they are inherently discretionary in nature, and thatthey should not be reviewed by any other body.  SeeHecklerv. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985).  The sameconsiderations should persuade FDA not to impose on manufacturers a duty toenforce FDA requirements with respect to independent parties.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed rules do not, by their terms, require implementationthrough contracts.  Nor could FDA impose such a requirement.  Congress has notauthorized FDA to use its authority over certain kinds of products--foods, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics-- as a springboard forregulation of contractual and other relations among private parties.  Such anovel expansion of regulatory authority requires a clear delegation byCongress.  There is none here.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, even vigorous attempts to coerce compliance through terminationof business relations or contract remedies would not work.  FDA's rules, ifinterpreted as broadly as they read, would make a cigarette manufacturer liablefor violations by a wholesaler or retailer handling the manufacturer's product.The rule arguably also would make the manufacturer liable if a customer of theretailer gave a cigarette it manufactured to a minor in the customer's home(under FDA's definition, a "point of sale").  Is the manufacturer to terminatebusiness with or assert contract remedies against (1)the distributor orretailer, for a violation by the customer or (2)the distributor, for aviolation by the retailer?  Actual enforcement of the vicarious liabilityscheme proposed by FDA would be enormously, and unjustifiably, disruptive ofmarket mechanisms.</tt><p><tt>	Sections 897.10 and 897.12 coerce manufacturers to take enforcementmeasures with respect to acts, principally by retailers, that already violateState and local laws-- laws that are already the responsibility of Stateand local governments to enforce (as Congress recognized in the ADAMHAReorganization Act of 1992).  There is no precedent, and no justification, fora federal agency to shift to private parties the law-enforcementresponsibilities of local, State and federal governments.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, many retailers --we believe about half --are supplied not by manufacturers, but rather by independent distributors.Even if manufacturers somehow could stop particular distributors from sellingto a retailer, they could not prohibit the retailer from obtaining productsfrom another source and selling them.</tt>"#fn125" [50<p>	In short, FDA's proposed rules would impose civil and criminal liability onmanufacturers for violations by persons over whom they have no authority, andover whom any attempt to assert authority compelled by FDA would beunprecedented and unwise.  In the absence of such authority, imposition ofvicarious liability violates due process.]<p><tt><b>		(b)	Directing Manufacturers To Interfere with the</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Property and Activities of Other Private</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Persons Is Beyond the Authority of Congress</b></tt><p><p><tt>	There is no power in the Constitution for a federal agency toconscript private persons to act as law enforcement personnel, or to force themfor that purpose to be officers or employees of the United States.  TheConstitution left to the States undelegated "the control of the militia to theextent that such control was not taken away by the exercise by Congress of itspower to raise armies."  Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 383(1917).  Indeed, the constitutional allocation of military authority amongCongress and the States "diminished the occasion for the exertion by Congressof its military power beyond the strict necessities for its exercise."Id.  Thus, when the defense of the country is at stake, the SupremeCourt has held, Congress may exercise its power to raise armies underArticleI, [[section]]8, in order to conscript individuals formilitary service.  Id. at384.  Later Supreme Court interpretationof the Constitution's militia clauses confirms that unless state militiapersonnel also have a federal affiliation, they act pursuant to the "Authorityof training the Militia" that Article I, [[section]] 8 reserves to the States.See Perpichv. Department of Defense, 496 U.S. 334,348 (1990).  </tt><p><tt>	If Congress lacks the power to conscript for national defensemilitia members except in very limited constitutionally prescribedcircumstances, see Article I, [[section]] 8, it follows afortiori that Congress lacks power to conscript private citizens outsidethose circumstances.  If Congress itself cannot by statute force citizens tobecome federal law-enforcement personnel, certainly an agency may not doso by regulation.  Moreover, an agency cannot lawfully delegate its law-enforcementor other governmental responsibilities to private entities absent an expresspower to do so clearly set forth in its enabling statute.  The Constitutionsimply grants no federal power, in the Commerce Clause or elsewhere, to forcecitizens to become federal law-enforcement personnel and punish them if theyrefuse to do so.</tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]]897.14--Additional Responsibilities ofRetailers</b></tt><p><tt>	In addition to their other responsibilities under Part897, Section897.14 would impose on retailers three more sets of responsibilities.

As already discussed, however, FDA lacksauthority to regulate cigarettes as restricted devices.

Unauthorized by Statute and Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.14(b) exceeds FDA's authority under Section520(e)of the FDCA because it does not purport to provide reasonable assurance of thesafety and effectiveness of cigarettes for persons who purchase and smoke them.This proposal is also precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992 andexceeds the federal government's powers under the Commerce Clause.  Seesupra.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	2.  Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons discussed in greater detail in connection withSection897.16(c), the hand-to-hand requirement is not justified as ayouth access measure.  The requirement is arbitrary and capricious insofar asit would apply to transactions even in establishments where persons under theage of 18 are either rarely found or actually not permitted-- forexample, factories, offices, taverns and bars; its application to transactionsin such establishments has no relation to the goal of reducing youth access totobacco products.  FDA cannot justify-- and has not even offered anyjustification for-- a ban on open-shelf displays or vending machines insuch establishments.</tt><p><tt>	Even in establishments in which persons under the age of 18 are to befound, the rule is unnecessary as long as the proprietor or an employee of theproprietor monitors product displays and demands proof of age before making asale.  FDA has presented no persuasive data suggesting that such measures couldnot effectively prevent misuse of vending machines.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts, without explanation or reference to any supporting evidence,that "[r]equiring the retailer's employees to hand cigarettes or smokelesstobacco products to customers, after checking identification, has the practicaleffect of making access to such products more difficult for young people."  60Fed. Reg. 41,324.  FDA apparently assumes that the requirement will operate tomake retail salesclerks more conscientious about refusing sales to minors.  FDAsuggests, without offering any supporting evidence or explanation, that therequirement will promote verification of age by clerks.  Id. at41,315.</tt><p><tt>	This suggestion is fallacious.  In any establishment where tobaccoproducts are sold over the counter, the cashier is the key to preventing salesto persons under the age of 18.  If the cashier is trained to comply with theapplicable minimum sales-age law and demands proof of age in doubtful cases,that should be sufficient to prevent illegal sales to minors.  (The same pointapplies with respect to a clerk charged with supervising use of a vendingmachine.)  The additional requirement that all transactions be conductedhand-to-hand simply makes the sale of tobacco products to adultcustomers more inconvenient, as FDA recognizes in the case of its proposedvending machine ban.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,360.</tt><p><tt>	Less severe alternatives could accomplish the Agency's goal.  For example,SAMHSA has noted that the City of Woodridge, Illinois, "essentially endedillegal sales to minors, apparently by using a licensinglaw... and the part-time efforts of one policeofficer."</tt>"#fn128" [52  The controls utilized bythat city-- widely cited as a model for other communities, and cited asexemplary by FDA itself (60 Fed. Reg. 41,322, 41,362)-- reduced cigarettesales rates to minors "to a minimal level" ]<tt>while permitting tobaccoproducts to be sold through vending machines and kept in displays directlyaccessible to customers.53  The authors of an article reviewing theWoodridge experience state:</tt><p><tt>"[T]o our knowledge, Woodridge is the first community to successfullyreduce cigarette sales rates to minors to a minimal level as a result oflegislation.  The key elements of the legislation are vendor licensing, activecompliance checking, and penalties for merchant sales violations and minors'possession of cigarettes.  Second, the combined effects of this legislation anda community awareness of the problem of adolescent smoking have substantiallyreduced the frequency of adolescent experimentation with cigarettes and regularsmoking."</tt>"#fn129" [54<p><p>	Obviously, as SAMHSA recognized, "it would not be prudent to rely on theexperience of one community in setting a national policy."55  Nevertheless, theexperience of Woodridge shows that FDA's rush to a total ban on "impersonal"modes of sale is precipitous and not warranted by experience, and the fact isthat Woodridge is by no means the only community that has achieved successwithout resorting to such draconian measures.  It simply is not necessary toban "impersonal" modes of sale in order to reduce underage sales to "a minimallevel" and to reduce smoking among young people.  For FDA to preclude State andlocal governments from relying on less drastic controls, in lieu of bans onvending machines and self-service displays, is not supported by the evidence.(]<tt>See our further comments on proposed Section897.16(c),infra, with respect to vending machines and self-servicedisplays.)</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.14(c)--Sales from UnopenedPackages</b></tt><p><tt>	This subsectionwould prohibit retailers and their employees frombreaking open a cigarette package or smokeless tobacco product to sell ordistribute cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in quantities that aresmaller than the quantity contained in the package.</tt>"#fn130" [56<p>]<p><tt><b>COMMENT</b>  </tt><p><tt>	This is a prohibition that the cigarette manufacturers support in Stateyouth access legislation.

Tobacco products on which a trade orbrand name of a nontobacco product was in use on January 1, 1995(e.g., "Harley Davidson," "Cartier" and "Ritz" cigarettes) wouldbe exempted from this prohibition.  This is in essence an advertisingrestriction.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	This subsection exceeds FDA's statutory authority, lacks factual support,is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992 and the Federal CigaretteLabeling and Advertising Act, lies beyond the federal government's powers underthe Commerce Clause, and would violate the First and Fifth Amendments.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	1.	Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	Despite the misleading heading FDA has assigned toSection897.16 ("Conditions of manufacture, sale, and distribution"), thisregulation governing nontobacco trade names does not constitute a restrictionon the "sale, distribution or use" of cigarettes designed to provide"reasonable assurance of [their] safety or effectiveness."  Therefore, it isnot authorized by FDCA Section520(e).</tt><p><tt>	The regulation likewise is not authorized by FDCA Section502.Although a device is misbranded if its label fails to contain its "establishedname," FDA has no authority to regulate trade names.  See 21 U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]352(e), 358.  Under Section502(a), FDA couldregulate product names only if they are false or misleading, not because theyare "appealing."  </tt><p><tt>	The asserted purpose of the prohibition against nontobacco product namesis to "reduce the appeal of cigarettes... to people youngerthan 18."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,324.  Although the FDCA gives FDA substantialauthority to regulate medical device labeling, nothing in the Act authorizesthe Agency to impose requirements specifically aimed at "reduc[ing] the appeal"of a lawful product.  FDA simply has no authority to regulate on thatbasis.</tt><p><tt>	The suggestion that FDA can prohibit a trade or brand name-- or anyother label feature-- merely on the ground that it makes a productattractive is wholly unprecedented.  FDA's approach would be comparable toforbidding foods from bearing "appealing" names when they contain constituents,such as saturated fat, that FDA considers undesirable.  Even FDA's rigorousnutrient content and health claims regulations for foods under the NutritionLabeling and Education Act (NLEA) do not go that far.  The NLEA regulationsprevent trade or brand names from suggesting that a food possesses unsupportedhealth benefits; but nothing in those regulations prevents a lawful food,regardless of its composition, from bearing a name that appeals to consumers.See generally 21 C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]101.13,101.14 (1995).  </tt><p><tt>	In addition, the NLEA regulations are based not on FDA's generalmisbranding authority, but rather on new and specific statutory authority inthe NLEA for regulation of brand names.  21U.S.C.[[section]]343(r)(2)(C) &amp; (D).  FDA possesses no authority under theFDCA to confine manufacturers to product names that are deemed to beunappealing.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>	2.	Not Factually Supported</b></tt><p><tt>	This proposed rule would make it quite difficult for manufacturers tointroduce new brands, in view of the likelihood that any new tobacco producttrade name already belongs to the maker of some nontobacco product.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA suggests that the rule is necessary because the use of nontobaccoproduct trade or brand names on tobacco products can make tobacco use"appealing" to young people.  FDA apparently believes that a trade or brandname of a nontobacco product may conjure up "imagery" that appeals to youngpeople, and that using the name on a tobacco product therefore would"circumvent" the purpose of FDA's ban on image advertising for tobaccoproducts.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,324.  FDA, however, cites no evidence,empirical or otherwise, in support of this supposition.  For many reasons, thesupposition is not an adequate basis for regulation.</tt><p><tt>	First, FDA provides no evidence that the use of nontobacco productnames in fact "appeals" to young people.  For example, FDA's proposed ruleevidently was prompted by three cigarette brand names-- Harley-Davidson,Cartier, and Yves St.Laurent's Ritz.  However, FDA presents no evidencewhatever that these names, or cigarette brands bearing these names, have had aspecial appeal to people under 18 years of age.  FDA has no expertise thatwould support an "intuition" that those names have positive meaning or appealto persons under 18; nor is there anything in common experience to suggest thatsuch an "intuition" is likely to be correct.  In fact, the market share forthese three cigarette brands was never more than minuscule:  the most popularof the three in the first half of 1995 was Harley Davidson, which had a marketshare of 0.3 percent.</tt>"#fn131" [57  Cartier is nolonger on the market; and, to our knowledge, Yves St. Laurent's Ritz cigarettes(which are manufactured by a European cigarette maker) are not currentlydistributed in the United States.  Thus, Section897.16(a) is notsupported by evidence in the record.  The evidence, in fact, is to thecontrary.]Second, Section897.16(a) is grossly overbroad even as ameans of reducing the supposed appeal of cigarettes to young people.  It isoverbroad (and for that reason, among others, violates the First Amendment)because it is not limited to prohibiting nontobacco product names that have ademonstrated appeal, or even a likely appeal, to young people.  Rather, itapplies to all nontobacco product names, regardless of appeal toyoung people.  FDA cannot justify that broad reach.  SeeZaudererv. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626,638, 646 (1985) (prophylactic rules not permitted; First Amendment places uponregulator the burden of distinguishing the harmful from the harmless).</tt><p><tt>	Third, Section897.16(a) is irrational because it applies evento names of nontobacco products that would be completely unfamiliar to Americanyoung people because they are not used commercially in the United States.  Theprohibition ignores the fact that many names have been registered fornontobacco products but have never been used commercially anywhere in theworld.  The mere fact of registration provides no legitimate basis forprohibiting a cigarette manufacturer from using the name for a cigarette.Again, the rule's overbreadth in this regard renders it defective under theFirst Amendment.  See Ibanezv. Florida Dept. of Bus.&amp; Pro. Regulation, 114 S.Ct. 2084 (1994); Peelv.Attorney Registration Bd., 493 U.S. 803 (1989).</tt><p><tt>	The requirement of searching trademarks would impose an impossible burdenon tobacco trademark owners.  The provision does not limit the nontobacco marksto registered marks, so common law uses also would be included.  Accordingly, asmall businessman using a mark in a small town for a locally produced productwith narrow distribution could prevent the use of that mark on a tobaccoproduct, thereby overriding trademark law, which requires a likelihood ofconfusion to prevent use or registration.  Since tobacco manufacturers will notbe capable of ferreting out all nontobacco mark usage with reasonablecertitude, they could breach the regulation unknowingly.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>	3.

Unauthorized by Statute and Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	A minimum package size requirement cannot be justified underSection520(e), which only authorizes restrictions designed to providereasonable assurance that a device will be safe in its use.  The number ofcigarettes in a pack, or the number sold at one time, has nothing to do withthe assurance of safety of any cigarette in its use.  As a purported youthaccess measure, the proposed rule also is precluded by the ADAMHAReorganization Act of 1992, for the reasons given in the General Commentssection of this volume.  The proposed rule also exceeds the federal commercepower and the other constitutional limitations discussed in the GeneralComments section.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	2.	Not Factually Supported</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal to prohibit the sale or distribution of packages containingfewer than 20 cigarettes is unsupported by the evidence.  Indeed, some of thevery evidence relied on by FDA undercuts the rule.  The weaknesses in FDA'sasserted justifications for this rule merit a somewhat extended discussionbecause they are emblematic of the weaknesses in FDA's asserted justificationsfor all of the proposed rules.</tt><p><tt>	FDA identifies two cigarette brands that U.S. manufacturers currentlyoffer in packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes in this country.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,324.  These sales --of 10 cigarettes to a pack --have very localized and very limited distribution.</tt>"#fn132" [58  Moreover, FDA cites no evidence thatpersons under the age of 18 are purchasing these products, or that theseproducts are disproportionately popular among such persons.  In short,Section897.16(b) is proposed as a response to what is essentially ahypothetical problem.<p>	FDA suggests that packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes would carryspecial appeal for persons under the age of 18 because such packages "areeasier to conceal, and are less expensive, than full-size packs."  60 Fed. Reg.41,324.  FDA, however, cites no surveys of American teenagers to support thisassertion.<p>	FDA also suggests that establishing a minimum package size is desirable as ameans of keeping cigarettes too expensive for young people:  "Young people, whogenerally have little disposable income, can be particularly sensitive to theprice of cigarettes and may choose not to smoke as the price increases."  60Fed. Reg. 41,324.  If young people were particularly price sensitive, as FDAsuggests, they presumably would favor reduced-price brands rather than premiumbrands; but according to FDA when it is arguing for its restrictions onadvertising and promotion, young people in fact favor premium brands.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,332.59  FDA cannot have it both ways.<p>	Whatever may be the effect of price on the willingness or ability of youngpeople to purchase tobacco products, any such effect is surely irrelevant iftobacco products may not under State law be ]<tt>sold to youngpeople.  Moreover, FDA's suggestion that smaller packs should be banned becausetheir lower price makes them attractive to young people obviously underminesthe rationale for any decision to amend Section897.16(b) to prescribe amaximum package size, as FDA has indicated it is considering (60 Fed.Reg. 41,324).</tt><p><tt>	The effect of Section897.16(b) would be to prevent cigarettemanufacturers from offering smaller packages to adult consumers, shouldthere be a market for such smaller packages.  The proposed rule would therebydeny adult consumers who wish to smoke less the option of purchasing packagescontaining fewer cigarettes.  Such an outcome is not compatible with FDA'sassurances, echoed by President Clinton, that the Agency does not mean to"restrict the use of tobacco products by adults."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,314.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cites three studies of purchases of so-called "kiddie packs" by youngpeople in Australia and Nova Scotia.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,324.  These studies donot provide a competent basis for FDA's proposed minimum package-sizerule.</tt><p><tt><b>		(a)</b>  <b>The Wilson Study</b></tt><p><tt>	The 1987 Australian study by Wilson et al. ("the Wilson study") reportedthat two cigarette brands offered in packages of 15 cigarettes ("15's") weremore popular with 14- and 15-year-old schoolchildren than with adults in theAdelaide metropolitan area in South Australia.</tt>"#fn146" [60  However, there is no reason to assume thatthe study's conclusion regarding the relative popularity of these brands among14- and 15-year-oldsis valid.  ]First, the authors acknowledged that they could offer noassurance that their 14- and 15-year-old population sample was representative.The authors stated that, "because resources were insufficient to conduct apopulation based probability sample," they had resorted to "a sample ofconvenience" to determine the extent to which 14- and 15-year-olds purchased15's and the reasons why they purchased 15's.  That is, the authors used astheir sample the population that happened to be nearest at hand.  Bydefinition, a "sample of convenience" is not representative, and results drawnfrom a "sample of convenience" are not projectable.</tt>"#fn147" [61  ]Second, the authors admitted that the comparison was based onresults drawn from two different population samples.  To make the desiredcomparison with adult purchase patterns, the authors compared the results drawnfrom their "sample of convenience" with the results drawn from an entirelydifferent survey of adults, conducted by others, utilizing a different samplingmethodology.  Comparisons of results from different surveys of differentpopulations are likely to be invalid.  </tt><p><tt>	The Wilson study apparently is the source of FDA's suggestion that smallerpackages appeal to young people because they are less expensive and more"concealable."  It is not clear, however, that the study actually supports thatsuggestion.  First, it is unclear whether the 15's actually were sold insmaller packages or, if so, whether the difference in size was enough to matterfrom the standpoint of "concealability."  Second, it is not clear thatthe study reported the reasons given for purchasing 15's by youths who weresmokers and actually purchased 15's.  Curiously, the number of youths inthe study giving reasons for purchasing 15's (153) exceeded the number ofyouths who reported that they had purchased 15's (148).  Thus, it is possiblethat all of the youths in the study were asked why they might purchase15's, regardless of whether they did so and regardless of whether they wereeven smokers.</tt>"#fn151" [62  If this were so, itwould be impossible to draw any conclusions as to why even those youths in the"sample of convenience" who actually purchased 15's did so.<p>	It should be noted, finally, that among the 14- and 15-year-olds in thesample, "price" was the leading reason given for purchasing 15's (67.3percent), but "concealability" was only a distant second (13.7 percent), while"]<tt>reducing smoking" was a close third (10.5 percent).  Thesmoking-reductionreason is not one that FDA chose to mention, presumably because that point doesnot support the imposition of a minimum-packagesize.  </tt><p><tt><b>		(b)  The Hill Study</b></tt><p><tt>	The 1987 Australian study by Hill et al. ("the Hill study") is cited byFDA for two findings-- that 15's were more popular among 12-year-oldsthan among 17-year-olds, and that "older children" preferred packages of 25cigarettes.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,324.  In fact, the study reported that acrossall age groups in the 12- to 17-year-old population sample, themost popular package size was 25 cigarettes (42 percent), and the nextmost popular package size was 30 cigarettes.  The study reported that onlyone-fifth of the sample smoked15's.</tt>"#fn153" [63<p>	Although the study did report that the preference this sample demonstrated for15's was inversely proportional to age, the study also noted that the youngestage group had shown the greatest decline in smoking prevalence in the period]<tt>following the introduction of 15's.</tt>"#fn154" [64  This fact suggests that smaller packagesare associated with less youth smoking, rather than more.  Finally, Hill'ssuggestion that price and concealability make smaller packages appealing toyounger smokers is inconsistent with the study's finding that packages of 25and 30 cigarettes were the most common among all age groups,]<tt>including the youngest.</tt>"#fn154" [65]<p><tt><b>		(c)  The Nova Scotia Study</b></tt><p><tt>	The 1990 study by the Nova Scotia Council on Smoking and Health ("the NovaScotia study") reported that 49 percent of the sixth-graders who identifiedthemselves as "current smokers" said they usually purchased 15's.</tt>"#fn155" [66  Apart from the issues raised by theabsurdly small size of this population sample (37 students) and the other studylimitations acknowledged by the Council itself, the Council simply]<tt>asserted that 15's were popular with younger smokers becausethey are "more affordable" and "more convenient."  </tt><p><tt>	Significantly, although the study reported that only 20 percent of thetwelfth-graders who identified themselves as "current smokers" usuallypurchased 15's (as compared to 49 percent of the sixth-graders), the study alsoreported that the twelfth-graderswere four times as likely as the sixth-graders to purchase singlecigarettes.  If price and "concealability" were the key factors for youngpeople, those in the youngest age group would surely be purchasing singlecigarettes, not 15's.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, the studies cited by FDA do not provide factual support forproposed Section 897.16(b).</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.16(c)--Vending Machines, Self-Service</b></tt><p><tt><b>	             Displays, Mail-Order Sales, and Other</b></tt><p><tt>	             <b>"Impersonal" Modes of Sale</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section897.16(c) provides:</tt><p><p><tt>	"Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products may be sold only in a direct,face-to-faceexchange between the retailer and the consumer.

According to Sheldon Silver ofthe National Automatic Merchandising Association ("NAMA"):<p>"[M]ost of the vending machines that sell cigarettes today arein... bars and taverns, or in restaurants where there is alock out device or in plants and offices and factories where teenagers do notfrequent.

In the teeth of the Surgeon General's observation that "little isknown" about the effectiveness of policies short of vending machinebans,</tt>"#fn167" [70 FDA arbitrarily rejects lessdrastic alternatives that are at hand.<p>	FDA rests its proposed vending machine ban on two kinds of evidence--surveys in which young people were asked where they have purchased or wherethey do purchase cigarettes (in which some young people reported that they havepurchased or do purchase cigarettes from vending machines); and numerousstudies designed to determine the extent to which young people]<tt>could purchase cigarettes from vending machines in variouslocations if they tried.  </tt><p><tt>	According to FDA, the first set of surveys shows that some young peopleindeed purchase cigarettes from vending machines,</tt>"#fn168" [71 and the second set of studies demonstratesthat young people in general have little difficulty buying cigarettes fromvending machines, regardless of whether the vending machines are required to beequipped with a locking device, and regardless of whether the vending machinesare in "adults-only" locations.<p>	It is on the basis of these latter studies-- which purport to assess"purchasability"72 rather than to describe actual purchasing patterns--that FDA concludes that "State and local laws restricting placement of, orrequiring locking devices on, vending machines appear to be ineffective," andthat a vending machine ban is the only "practical" solution.  60 Fed. Reg.41,325.  These studies, however, do not support FDA's conclusion or a generalvending machine ban.]<b>Locking Devices</b>.  Locking devices are mechanisms thatrequire an employee to activate the vending machine prior to each use byoperating an electronic switch.  FDA cited only one study-- a studyconducted in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1990 ("the St. Paul study")-- asaddressing the efficacy of a vending machine locking-device requirement.</tt>"#fn172" [73  The Institute of Medicine cited this samestudy as the basis for its conclusion that locking devices are an inadequatecontrol.74  <p>	FDA may not base a general judgment about the efficacy of locking devices, andproceed immediately to a total nationwide ban, on the basis of an asserted lackof demonstrated effect, based on the results of a single study involving asingle city.75  Indeed, the much-touted tobacco sales ordinance in Woodridge,Illinois, where illegal tobacco sales to minors were reduced "from 83 percentto zero," ]<tt>included a locking-device requirement rather than aban on cigarette vending machines.</tt>"#fn174" [76<p>	On its own terms, moreover, the St. Paul study does not support a generalvending machine ban.  ]<tt>First, notwithstanding FDA's pessimisticreading of the study's results, both the Surgeon General and SAMHSA have readthe study results differently.  Both have hailed the study as showing thatinstallation of locking devices on vending machines can "significantly reduce"youth access.</tt>"#fn175" [77 ]Second, the study's authors indicated that enforcement of theapplicable state minimum sales-age law in public locations in St. Paulgenerally was lax (at best) at the time of the study, so that some retail salespersonnel subject to the locking-devicerequirement apparently were themselves lax in avoiding illegal sales to minors.The study did not address the efficacy of a locking-device requirement in thecontext of conscientious enforcement of applicable minimum sales-agelaws.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the vending machines in the study did not includemachines located in private businesses such as industrial plants and officeswith no public access and a fortiori no youth access.  In fact,as noted above, nearly 40 percent of all cigarette vending machines are locatedin such businesses.  Thus, the study cannot be the basis for anyregulation addressing vending machines in such locations.  A study purportingto address the efficacy of locking devices in places open to the general publiccannot form the basis of a rule regulating vending machines in places to whichthe public does not have access.</tt>"#fn176" [78  <p>	Locking-device and other supervision requirements are not self-enforcing.Just as State and local authorities also must police over-the-counter sales toensure compliance by retailers with minimum sales-age laws, so thoseauthorities must police vending machine sales-- including denial ofaccess to minors-- by those who maintain vending machines in locationsopen to the public.  As the Inspector General of the Department of Health andHuman Services observed in a 1992 report, "[s]upervision of vending machinesrequires the same enforcement efforts as over-the-counter sales."79  As theauthors of one youth-accessstudy cited by FDA stated with respect to vending machines:<p>"Indoctrination for license holders on the content of the laws, the importanceof compliance, and techniques for active intervention, is clearly in order.Education alone, however, will likely be ineffective and our results also callfor systematic enforcement of tobacco laws, which together with education cansignificantly reduce sales to minors."80<p><p>To judge the efficacy of mechanical or other vending machine access controls inthe absence of active law-enforcement efforts is arbitrary and capricious.  <p>	As the authors of the St. Paul study observed, "[v]ery little is known aboutthe effectiveness of locking devices in limiting minors' ability to purchasecigarettes."81  Nevertheless, FDA does cite one other study (albeit in adifferent context) that suggests that locking-devicerequirements ]<tt>can be effective in preventing youth access tovending machines.  That study involved purchase attempts at vending machineslocated in business establishments open to the public in Arlington, Texas, in1993.</tt>"#fn182" [82  In the Texas study, the singlevending machine equipped with a locking device was the one machine from whichminors were ]<tt>not able to purchase cigarettes.  Although FDAcited this study (60 Fed. Reg. at 41,342 n.45), it chose not to mentionthis fact-- presumably because, like the Woodridge precedent, itfailed to support the proposed rule.</tt><p><tt>	<b>Adults-Only Locations</b>.  The studies cited by FDA assessing"purchasability" in "adults-only" locations likewise do not support a generalvending machine ban.  First, with one possible exception, it does notappear that any of these studies addressed "purchasability" inindustrial plants and private offices, which account for about 40 percent ofall cigarette vending machines.</tt>"#fn187" [83]<tt>Second, the fact that minors may have been able to purchasecigarettes from vending machines in "adult" establishments (such as cocktaillounges and bars) as part of studies designed to test "purchasability" is not asufficient basis for rulemaking if minors in fact either do not or seldomattempt to purchase cigarettes from vending machines in such establishments inthe real world.</tt>"#fn192" [84  FDA has presented --and the record contains-- no data on actual purchases by persons under 18at such establishments.  These studies also do not address the penalties towhich merchants would be subject for selling cigarettes to minors.  It istherefore impossible to determine, based on these studies, whether merchantshad sufficient incentives to enforce existing laws and ordinances.<p>	FDA claims that banning vending machines is "consistent" with recommendationsfrom the Institute of Medicine, the Public Health Service, a working group ofState Attorneys General, and the Inspector General of HHS.  60 Fed. Reg.41,325.  This claim is misleading.  The Inspector General of HHS, whileidentifying vending machine bans as an "option" that States might choose toreduce underage smoking, did not make recommendations.85  IOM, whilerecommending a vending machine ban, also agreed that less restrictivealternatives to a complete ban might be acceptable "if shown to beeffective."86  The Public Health Service, commenting on a "model" youth accesslaw it developed that did include a vending machine ban, neverthelessrecommended that States "carefully examine" options short of a complete ban:<p>"This is another area where states should examine options carefully; allowingsales in places not legally open to minors, or use of store-controlledelectronic enabling devices, may be acceptable alternatives."87  <p><p>	Similarly, although the Working Group of State Attorneys General recommendedbanning vending machines, its recommendation applied ]<tt>only tovending machines in retail stores; and the Working Group also endorsed lockingdevices as a less drastic control.</tt>"#fn198" [88Noting that 21 States have already adopted laws "restricting ]<tt>oreliminating" vending machines, the Working Group recommended that the remainingStates take "similar action."</tt>"#fn199" [89<p>	SAMHSA, in its proposed rules implementing Section1926 of the PublicHealth Service Act, notably did ]<tt>not recommend that the Statesban vending machines.  It suggested only that the States would face significantchallenges in complying with Section 1926 unless they adopted "controls ontobacco vending machines in locations accessible to minors."  58 Fed.Reg. 45,156, 45,161 (Aug.26, 1993) (emphasis added).  FDA, in its zeal,has taken with respect to vending machines a position more extreme than that ofany of these organizations.  </tt><p><tt>	It is a strength, not a weakness, of our federal system that in areasentrusted to their care, States will experiment with a broad range ofregulatory approaches.  As Justice Brandeis wrote, "[i]t is one of the happyincidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if itscitizens choose, serve as a laboratory;  and try novel social and economicexperiments without risk to the rest of the country."  New State IceCo.v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,dissenting).  Without any clear authorization from Congress, in the teeth ofevidence that Congress intended the States to have flexibility to devisetheir own solutions, in the absence of evidence supporting a one-size-fits-allapproach, and with arrogance unsupported by any superior expertise orexperience, FDA would prevent States from experimenting with alternativeapproaches to vending machine regulation.</tt><p><tt>	FDA also suggests that all vending machines should be banned because, itspeculates, persons under the age of 18 will increasingly attempt to purchasecigarettes from such machines as merchants make it increasingly difficult forsuch persons to purchase cigarettes over the counter.  60 Fed. Reg.41,325.</tt>"#fn200" [90  Again, this possibility doesnot support any action with respect to vending machines in establishments thatare not open to the public, and it does not support a vending machine ban inestablishments open to the public so long as the machines are supervised.Ensuring that those charged with supervising vending machines in establishmentsopen to the public do not permit them to be used by persons under the age of 18requires the same conscientious policing by State and local authorities as isrequired to ensure that salesclerks in retail outlets do not sell cigarettes tominors over the counter.<p>	FDA asserts, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that a total ban on vendingmachines would entail less of a "regulatory burden" than more narrowly drawnrestrictions.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,325.  The Agency's preference for banningvending machines in lieu of regulating them mocks the national demand for lessgovernment and is surely little comfort to vending machine companies who standto lose significant revenues from cigarette sales to adult consumers, andequally little comfort to those adult consumers who will be inconvenienced bythe ban.  <p>	Total revenue from cigarette vending machine sales was estimated at$624million in 1993 by one source, and at $2.2 billion by another.91Vending machine revenues from cigarette sales may be declining, but thebusiness is still very important to vending machine operators, approximatelythree-quarters of whom have revenues of under $1million.92  As]<tt>Vending Times recently commented:</tt><p><tt>"Cigarette vending remains a valuable service to locations catering tosmokers but not wishing to confront the difficulties of handling tobaccoproducts, and will undoubtedly remain viable as long as it ispermitted."</tt>"#fn206" [93<p><p>	Finally, FDA suggests that it is legitimate to ban cigarette vending machinesbecause they are disappearing anyway, and a ban therefore would merely hastenthe inevitable.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,325.  In making this suggestion, FDA cites thelowest estimate of the number of cigarette vending machines in the UnitedStates in 1993-- 182,000-- rather than the higher estimate of480,000 supported by Census Bureau data and other industry sources.]<tt>See supra.  In any event, FDA's argument is a nonsequitur.  Trends in cigarette vending machine sales may be pertinent toan assessment of the costs of the proposed ban, but cannot themselves serve asa substantive justification for it.</tt><p><tt>	FDA also implies, incorrectly, that vending machine operators will be ableto substitute other products for cigarettes.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,325.  Asdiscussed above, nearly 80percent of all cigarette vending machines arelocated in factories or offices or in "adults only" locations such as bars.  Insuch establishments, if a demand exists for vending-machine products other thancigarettes, simple economics suggests that such demand already is being met.Thus, contrary to FDA's suggestion, cigarette vending machine operatorsgenerally will not be able to substitute other products.  Seeinfra.</tt><p><tt>	The goal of curbing youth access would be met by State and local lawsrequiring proper supervision of vending machines in locations that minorstypically frequent.  That goal does not justify banning vending machines(including those that are properly supervised or are located in places thatminors do not typically frequent).  FDA's proposed ban on cigarette vendingmachines is not supported by the Agency's purported rationale, is not supportedby the evidence in the record, and is arbitrary and capricious.</tt><p><tt><b>		(b)  "Self-Service" Displays</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.16(c) would also prohibit cigarettes and smokelesstobacco products from being kept in displays that are directly accessible tocustomers.  FDA suggests that banning such open or "self-service" displays isjustified (1) as a means of "increas[ing] the direct interaction between thesalesclerk and the underage customer," (2) as a means of keeping young peoplefrom obtaining tobacco products by theft, and (3) as a means of "`reinforc[ing]the message that tobacco products are not in the same class as candy or potatochips.'"  60 Fed. Reg. 41,325 (quoting Institute of Medicine.  Growing UpTobacco Free 215 (1994)).  In fact, the prohibition is not justified on anyof these grounds, especially in light of the burden on retailers and adultconsumers that the prohibition would entail.  Moreover, FDA failed to considerobvious alternatives short of banning open-shelf displays that would satisfyany legitimate youth-accessconcern.  Therefore, Section897.16(c) is arbitrary and capricious.</tt><p><tt><b>			(i)  FDA's Asserted Justifications</b></tt><p><tt>	<b>Increased Interaction</b>.  If a salesclerk is required to handthe product to the customer, there obviously will be more "interaction" betweenthe two than if the customer need only tender payment.  The question is whetherthis additional "interaction" is necessary to ensure, or would materiallyenhance, compliance by the salesclerk with the minimum sales-agelaw.  FDA has not established either proposition.</tt><p><tt>	The IOM, on which FDA relies, asserted that requiring an underage customerto ask the clerk for the product "increases the chance that a clerk will noticethat the customer is underage and will refuse to conduct the sale."</tt>"#fn207" [94  This is sheer speculation.  Neither the IOMnor FDA cites any data that support it.  It is not self-evident that a clerk ismore likely to "notice" a customer's age if the customer asks for the productthan if the customer "only" tenders payment and asks the clerk to make thesale.  A requirement that the clerk demand proof of age in doubtful casesshould provide all the "interaction" that is required to avoid sales tominors.95<p>	FDA cites only one actual study in support of its view that banningself-service displays would reduce illegal sales to minors-- againrelying, as it did in the case of the proposed vending machine ban, on a singlestudy to support a rule with nationwide impact, and ignoring such contraryevidence as the experience of Woodridge, Illinois under an ordinance permittingopen-shelfdisplays.  <p>	The study cited by FDA, as described in summary fashion in a "position paper"by a Northern California antismoking group, involved a before-and-after surveyin five communities.96  According to the write-up, prior to the adoption of aself-service display ban in each community, minors were sent into all retailoutlets in the community to test compliance with the State minimum sales-agelaw.  Thereafter, every six months for two years following the adoption of thedisplay ban, minors were again sent into all retail outlets to test compliance.The study reported increased compliance with the minimum sales-age lawfollowing adoption of the display bans.<p>	Even taking its results at face value, this study cannot be consideredsufficient to support a national rule.  ]<tt>First, it cannot bediscerned from the "position paper" whether the display-ban ordinances adoptedin these communities contained any other provisions that independently wouldhave led to enhanced compliance with the minimum sales-age law.  Second,the "position paper" does not disclose whether the retailers were told of thecompliance testing operation either before or after the fact.  Knowledge thatthey were being (or had been) targeted for "buying attempt surveys" wouldsurely have made the retailers more vigilant about ensuring compliance,regardless of how their products were displayed.  Third, it is quitepossible that it was the fact of the adoption of new tobacco control ordinances(and the new penalties prescribed for violations), rather than the particularrestrictions the ordinances imposed, that made retailers more vigilant inensuring compliance.  See discussion supra (discussingrelationship of community awareness of problem to compliance in Woodridge).Here, as elsewhere, where it suits its purpose, FDA relies on a "report lackingthe details which permit scientific evaluation," 21 C.F.R.[[section]]314.126(e) (1995); see also 21 C.F.R.[[section]]860.7(c)(2) (1995).</tt><p><tt>	In sum, this was not a controlled study.  The conclusion asserted reflectsthe well-knownfallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Thereis no indication that any effort was made to prevent bias, that the study hasbeen subjected to peer review, or that it had been published in a scientificjournal.  Because there was no control group, no statistical analysis of thereported results is possible.  In any other context, FDA would never regard asingle study of this sort as proof of the effectiveness of an intervention.See 21 C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]314.126, 860.7(c)(1995).</tt><p><tt>	<b>Preventing Theft</b>.  FDA's suggestion that self-servicedisplays should be banned as a means of preventing children from shopliftingtobacco products is one of the more remarkable justifications offered by theAgency in this rulemaking.  It presupposes that retailers themselves areinsufficiently motivated, or are unable, to identify the most appropriate meansof preventing theft in their own establishments.  Notwithstanding FDA's stance,courts have long been unwilling to conclude, "contrary to all humanexperience," that companies are incapable of acting "in their ownself-interest."  United Statesv. E.I. DuPont deNemours&amp; Co., 366 U.S. 316, 332 (1961).</tt>"#fn213" [97<p>	FDA cites two other papers in support of its shoplifting rationale.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,343 n.65.  One of these papers, however, offers no additional evidenceregarding pilferage, but simply cites the same Cummings study.98  The otherpaper offers no evidence at all that banning self-service displays is needed toprevent shoplifting.  To the contrary, the paper notes that "many retailers"address shoplifting concerns by keeping single packages of cigarettes notbehind the counter, but "at the register."99  FDA neglects to mention thishighly relevant fact, choosing instead to highlight the Working Group'sendorsement of self-service display bans.  ]<b>Sending a "Message" About Tobacco Products</b>.  FDA has noauthority to regulate the manner in which a product is displayed for thepurpose of communicating a "message" about how that product should beperceived.  Nothing in the FDCA authorizes FDA to take any action with respectto a lawful product on that basis.</tt><p><tt>	FDA offers no evidence, moreover, to support the notion that children oradults consider tobacco products to be "`in the same class as candy or potatochips.'"  The IOM, from which FDA borrowed this colorful quotation, offered nosuch evidence.  On FDA's logic, open-shelf displays of beer or wine in retailstores also should be banned-- in order to send a similar "message" aboutthose age-restrictedproducts.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, as discussed elsewhere in these comments, the message FDA wantsto send has already been sent, received, and understood.  There is no evidencethat young people believe that cigarettes are akin to "candy and potatochips."</tt><p><tt><b>			(ii)  Burdens</b></tt><p><tt>	As discussed in our cost-benefit analysis in VolumeX and in theBarents Group economic study in VolumeXI, FDA downplays the severehardships to retailers that would result from a ban on self-servicedisplays of cigarettes.  In many stores, the proposed ban would requireextensive physical renovations to accommodate behind-the-counter displays.  Therequired renovations would be costly and inconvenient-- and possiblyprohibitively expensive or even physically impossible.  At a minimum, banningself-service displays would drastically limit the quantity and variety oftobacco products carried-- an effect with substantial implications forconsumer choice and competition among the cigarette manufacturers.  Such a banmight well require retailers to hire additional employees to staff the new"tobacco corner."  New physical layouts would have to be designed toaccommodate cartons.  Finally, the ban would deprive merchants of significantrevenues they receive from tobacco companies for commercially valuable floorspace-- revenues likewise received from makers of other consumerproducts, including other age-restricted products such as beer and wine.  Amandated reduction in demand for such floor space inevitably would reduce therevenues received by retailers.</tt><p><tt><b>			(iii)  Alternatives</b></tt><p><tt>	Dozens of communities around the country-- from New England toCalifornia-- have rejected self-service display bans in favor of lessdrastic, but entirely effective, measures --measures that FDA did not even consider, as it was required to do underExecutive Order12,866 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (Pub. L.104-4).  </tt><p><tt>	These measures typically require cigarette package displays to be keptwithin a specified distance of the cash register, or in the cashier's line ofsight, so as to ensure proper monitoring of the displays.</tt>"#fn218" [100  They typically do not restrict placementof cigarette cartons, which even the proponents of display restrictionsacknowledge do not present significant shoplifting issues.  FDA did not evenconsider these alternatives, however, presumably because anything short of aban would not send what FDA holds to be the politically correct "message."<p>	The goal of curbing youth access would be adequately served by State and locallaws requiring retailers to post conspicuous signs stating that the sale oftobacco products to persons under the age of 18 is prohibited (which signswould send the message FDA desires), by requiring retailers to train theirsalesclerks to observe the prohibition against underage sales, by requiringsalesclerks to demand proof of age from prospective purchasers in doubtfulcases, and by making the enforcement of minimum sales-age laws a priority forState and local law-enforcement authorities.  The goal of curbing youth accessto tobacco products is ]<tt>not served by forcing retailers to keepall tobacco products behind the counter.</tt>"#fn218" [101  ]<p><tt><b>		(c)  Mail-Order Sales</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.16(c) also would prohibit mail-order sales of tobaccoproducts and redemption of mail-order coupons.</tt>"#fn219" [102  Noting that mail-order sale anddistribution provide no "face-to-face interaction to verify the age of theconsumer," and asserting that the current industry practice requires only thatthe customer certify in writing that he or she is at least 21 years old, FDAstates that a prohibition on mail-order sales would significantly reduce accessto cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products by persons under the age of 18.60 Fed. Reg. 41,325-26.<p>	Such a ban on mail-ordersales of cigarettes is beyond FDA's statutory authority.  In effect, FDAproposes to declare cigarettes to be nonmailable matter.  NeitherSection520(e) nor any other provision of the FDCA gives FDA authority toregulate the mails or to determine what matter is mailable.  Congress has notexcluded cigarettes from the mail.  In addition, Congress has recognized, inthe Prescription Drug Marketing Act, that the U.S. Postal Service and othercommon carriers are appropriate for the distribution of prescription drugsamples, which are limited by law to distribution to authorized persons.]<tt>See 21 U.S.C. [[section]]353(d)(2).  Finally, whereCongress has determined that certain products should not be shipped through themail for purposes of protecting the public health, it has specificallylegislated to that effect.  See Drug and Household Substance Mailing Actof 1990, 39 U.S.C. [[section]]3001(f)-(g).  Accordingly, FDA'sprohibition on mail order of cigarettes would be unauthorized and contrary tolaw.  </tt><p><tt>	The proposed ban also is unwarranted.  Again, FDA offers no evidence of anactual problem that its rule is designed to meet.  The Agency cites no studiesfinding that any appreciable number of persons under the age of 18 actually usethe mails to obtain cigarettes.  Indeed, the Institute of Medicine acknowledgesthat "[t]he extent of mail-order purchase of tobacco products by minors is notknown."</tt>"#fn219" [103  In fact, mail-order salesaccount for only a tiny fraction of cigarettes sold, and there is no evidencethat mail-order sales present a significant youth access issue.  FDA has notestablished that a problem exists that warrants a ban on mail-ordersales.104<p>	Moreover, the Agency has failed to consider obvious, less restrictivealternatives.  If the industry's current practice of requiring customers tocertify in writing that they are at least 21 years of age is deemed aninsufficient safeguard against underage access, alternatives short ofprohibiting mail distribution are available.  One mail-order house, forexample, ensures that minors cannot make purchases by requiring customers topay by check or credit card.105  Manufacturers could be required to maintainrecords evidencing their compliance with these proof-of-age requirements.  FDAdid not even consider such alternatives.]<p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>	3.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt><b>		(a)  Commerce Clause/Tenth and Ninth Amendments</b></tt><p><tt>	The proposed ban on vending machines and self-servicedisplays set forth in Section897.16(c) exceeds federal authority underthe Commerce Clause and the Tenth and Ninth Amendments, for the reasons setforth in the General Comments section.</tt><p><tt><b>		(b)  Takings Clause</b></tt>"#fn222" [106<p>	The proposed ban on vending machines and self-servicedisplays set forth in Section 897.16(c) violates the Takings Clause of theFifth Amendment, which provides:  "[N]or shall private property be taken forpublic use, without just compensation."

Under Section897.16(c), the ownersof every cigarette vending machine now in operation would be deprived of theeconomic use of their property.

Monsanto, 467 U.S. 986, 1005 (1984).See Penn Central Transp. Co.v. New York City, 438U.S. 104, 124 (1978).  Based on decades of experience, vending machine ownersreasonably expect that their machines may be used to sell legal products suchas cigarettes.  Such individuals have investedmillions of dollars inthese machines, and in some cases, rely on cigarette sales for theirlivelihoods.</tt>"#fn243" [109  Jack Kerner, member ofthe Amusement and Music Operators Association and president of Melo-ToneVending (which operates 1500 cigarette vending machines), has stated that theproposed regulation "is going to destroy" cigarette vending machine owners.<p>	Section897.16(c)'s interference with the reasonable investment-backedexpectations of vending machine owners alone suffices to effect a taking.  FDA,however, is also targeting a small class of property owners to bear the cost ofthe proposed regulation.  A taking has occurred where regulations interferewith the property rights of a narrow group of owners.  ]<tt>See,e.g., A.A. Profiles, Inc.v. City of Ft.Lauderdale, 850 F.2d 1483 (11th Cir. 1988) (narrow infringement on privateproperty was impermissible where, to achieve its objectives, city had othernonconfiscatory avenues available that would spread cost among the public),cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1020 (1989); Wheelerv.Pleasant Grove, 664 F.2d 99, 100 (5th Cir. 1981) (ordinance targeted atparticular holder of building permit was confiscatory in nature and acompensable taking), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 973 (1982).Section897.16(c) indisputably is targeted at operators of cigarettevending machines; it does not impose comparable burdens on those who sellcigarettes over the counter.  That additional fact militates in favor of afinding that, if adopted, Section897.167(c) would give rise to acompensable taking.  </tt><p><tt><b>			(iii)	FDA's Assertion That Vending Machines May</b></tt><p><tt><b>					Be Converted to Other Uses Is Irrelevant</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>and Factually Incorrect                  </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's assertion that the proposed regulation would not effect a takingbecause the vending machines "would continue to have economic value if theywere modified for other uses," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,358, ignores establishedstandards for determining when a taking has occurred.  In addition, FDA'sargument is unsupported as a matter of fact.  </tt><p><tt>	First, FDA's assumption that cigarette vending machines are readilyconvertible to other uses is not sustained by any factual finding or evidencein the administrative record.  To justify its argument for convertibility, FDArelies only on a one-sentence excerpt from the Vending Times.Id.  Even this "evidence," however, fails to bolster FDA's conclusion.The Vending Times excerpt refers to a recent trend in the vendingmachine industry toward using glass-frontmachines, which it says are convertible to other uses.  FDA says nothing aboutthe convertibility of the hundreds of thousands of non-glass-frontmachines already in use around the nation.  In fact, the use of glass-frontcigarette vending machines is a relatively recent development.  "Regularcigarette vendors" continue to use other types of vending machines.</tt>"#fn244" [110  <p>	In any event, the fact that some vending machines might continue to retainsome economic value is of little consequence.  The proposed regulation wouldgive owners who sell cigarettes through vending machines few choices.  In manycases, they will have to sell these machines for scrap.  Alternatively, iftheir machines are convertible, they may be able to sell them atbargain-basement prices to vendors of candy or other products, who probablywould take advantage of the glut caused when cigarette vendors become desperateto sell their now-useless machines.  <p>	If unable to sell their machines, cigarette vending machine owners would haveto incur considerable out-of-pocketexpense to convert these machines (assuming conversion is even possible) toenter into a new market, in which they may have little or no experience.  Somevendors, for example, focus their business exclusively in bars and taverns, andderive a substantial portion of their revenue from the sale of a limited numberof products, including cigarettes.  These "street vendors" tend to be smallbusiness people, and would suffer severe harm from the rule.  <p>	Indeed, FDA's own economic impact analysis states:  "The proposed prohibitionof vending sales would require these firms to ]<tt>develop newmarkets to replace these sales revenues."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,369 (emphasisadded).  Plainly, markets that must be "develop[ed]" do not now exist.</tt><p><tt>	Imagining or inventing some other hypothetical use for the property doesnot enable the government to evade its responsibility to compensate individualsfor takings.  Similarly, FDA's musings regarding "other uses" and "new markets"for the vending machines do not vitiate the fact that Section897.16(c)would effect a taking.</tt>"#fn246" [111  Indeed, theTakings Clause would have little meaning if all that was required of thegovernment was to conjure up some alternative use of the affected property --without regard to whether such alternative use was realistic or feasible forthe property owner.  Yet this is precisely what FDA seeks to do in justifyingSection897.16(c).  ]<p><tt><b>			(iv)	The Proposed Regulation Is Overbroad,</b></tt><p><tt><b>				and Effects a Taking at Least of Those</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Vending Machines to Which Minors Have</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Little or No Access                   </b></tt><p><p><tt>	In assessing whether a governmental action constitutes a taking, courtslook to whether the action "substantially advance[s]" a legitimate publicpurpose.  See Nollanv. California Coastal Comm'n,483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987).  Further, the infringement on private property mustbe "roughly proportional" to the degree to which the public interest ishindered by unfettered use of that property.  See Dolanv.City of Tigard, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 2319 (1994) (requiring "roughproportionality" between burden placed on private property and degree to whichpublic interest is impinged on by unfettered use of private property).  </tt><p><tt>	Here, the stated purpose is reducing smoking by minors.  The proposedregulation, however, targets all vending machines, regardless oflocation or accessibility to minors, and regardless of degree of supervision.As noted above, a significant number of cigarette vending machines are locatedin areas not frequented by minors.  </tt><p><tt>	By imposing a sweeping ban on cigarette vending machines that does notdistinguish between machines in locations frequented by minors(e.g., shopping malls) and those in locations frequented only byadults (e.g., bars), or between those in publicly accessiblelocations that are supervised and those that are not, the regulation fails therequirement that the infringement on property substantially advance alegitimate public purpose.  See Dolan, 114 S. Ct. at 2319;Nollan, 483 U.S. at 834.  Banning cigarette vending machines from placesthat minors do not frequent, or from places where they are closely supervised,will not substantially advance the goal of reducing smoking by minors.</tt><p><tt>	It is highly unlikely that cigarette vending machines in bars, taverns,business offices, factories, or other locations where minors are not permittedplay any role, let alone a substantial role, in youth smoking.  BecauseSection897.16(c) lacks a proportional or even a substantial relationshipto its stated public purpose, it would effect a taking with respect to machinesthat are inaccessible to minors.</tt><p><tt><b>			(v)	The Proposed Regulation Destroys</b></tt><p><tt><b>				the Contractual Rights of Cigarette</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Vending Machine Owners             </b></tt><p><p><tt>	In addition to effecting a taking of hundreds of thousands of vendingmachines, Section897.16(c) would also destroy the proprietary interest ofvending machine owners in their contractual arrangements with a wide variety ofproperty owners and occupiers, including the valuable consideration paid tosuch owners and occupiers.  The value of such consideration would be includedin the calculation of compensation due to vending machine owners.</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, the destruction of these contracts, and the loss of theconsideration paid thereon, may constitute a taking independent of thedestruction or diminution of value of the vending machines.</tt>"#fn251" [112  In any event, FDA has failed to meet itsobligation under Executive Order 12,630, Section3(a) to "be sensitive to,anticipate and account for" these potential burdens on the public fisc.  <p>	Cigarette vending machine owners enter into contracts with property owners andoccupiers to place their machines on the owners' or occupiers' premises.Vending machine owners have paid valuable consideration in exchange for theright to sell their products on the premises.

FDAasserts that "[s]elf-servicedisplays, in many instances, could be moved, adapted, or locked to comply withthe requirement of direct transfer from retailers to consumers.  Thus, likevending machines, self-servicedisplays would retain their utility rather than los[e] their value."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,358.  This is sheer speculation; it is also wrong.  The complianceaudit performed by A.T.Kearney, see Volume XI, found that severaltypes of self-servicedisplays could not be moved or locked.  And FDA never explains how self-servicedisplays could be "adapted" to other uses.  </tt><p><tt>	Even if FDA is correct in asserting that some displays "could be moved,adapted, or locked" to comply with the proposed requirement, 60 Fed. Reg.41,358, it is undeniable that many owners of such displays would find itprohibitively expensive or even physically impossible to do so.  SeeVolumes X and XI, infra.  Unable to convert their signs, shelving,display cases, and display materials to other uses, these owners would have nochoice but to discard them.  The proposed ban would thus deprive many owners ofself-servicedisplays of all beneficial use of their property, resulting in a takingper se.  See Lucasv. South CarolinaCoastal Council, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 2893 (1992); see alsoArmstrongv. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960) (theTakings Clause is intended "to bar Government from forcing some people alone tobear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by thepublic as a whole").</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.16(d)--Free Samples</b></tt>"#fn262" [114<p>	Section897.16(d) would prohibit the distribution of free samples ofcigarettes or smokeless tobacco products.

Moreover, because a priceregulation does not limit the categories of persons to whom, or the categoriesof places where, the product may be distributed or sold, or the identities ofusers, a ban on free samples is not a restriction on "sale, distribution, oruse" within the meaning of Section520(e).<p>	Accordingly, this proposed regulation is unlawful.  <p>]<p><tt><b>	2.  Precluded by ADAMHA and FCLAA</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons discussed in the General Comments section,Section897.16(d) is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act and theFederal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.  See Federal TradeCommission, Report to Congress for 1993 Pursuant to the Federal CigaretteLabeling and Advertising Act (1995) (including sampling among other formsof cigarette advertising and promotion as to which the Commission is requiredto report under 15 U.S.C. [[section]]1337).</tt><p><p><tt><b>	3.</b>  <b>Not Factually Supported</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA offers no evidence of an actual problem that its proposed ban onsampling is designed to meet.  The proposed rule is grossly overbroad to theextent that it could be interpreted to prohibit gifts of complimentary packagesto employees and trade customers, or to guests and visitors attending sponsoredevents.  Moreover, the distribution of cigarette samples to members of thepublic as a form of product promotion, while still valued by most of thecigarette manufacturers as a means of introducing adult smokers to new brandsand reintroducing them to old ones, is not extensively utilized.  In 1993, thelatest year for which industrywide figures are available, cigarette samplingaccounted for only 0.7 percent of the total spent on cigarette advertising andpromotion-- down from a high of 7.9 percent in 1982.</tt>"#fn264" [116  <p>	In part, the steep decline reflected in the 1993 number was the result ofstrict new limitations on sampling adopted by the cigarette manufacturers inDecember 1990 as part of a broad package of industry initiatives to reduceyouth access to tobacco products.  Before December 1990, the cigarettemanufacturers' voluntary code prohibited sampling within two blocks of anycenter of youth activities, prohibited the distribution of samples to personsunder the age of 21, and required samplers to demand proof of age in doubtfulcases.  As amended in December 1990, the ]<tt>CigaretteAdvertising and Promotion Code now provides the following additionalproscription:</tt><p><tt>"Sampling shall not be conducted in or on public streets, sidewalks orparks, except in places that are open only to persons to whom cigaretteslawfully may be sold."  </tt><p><p><tt>	FDA is seemingly unaware of the restrictive nature of the cigarettemanufacturers' voluntary code.  FDA claims that "many youngpeople... receive free samples" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,326;see also id. at 41,315), but the single source cited forthis assertion is the 1989 report of the Surgeon General.  That report, ofcourse, predates the limitation on sampling adopted by the cigarettemanufacturers in 1990.  Even so, FDA has overstated the Surgeon General'sviews.  The Surgeon General did not say that "many children" receive freesamples; she said that "[c]hildren also obtain cigarettes...as free samples."</tt>"#fn265" [117  Many of thespecific scenarios that FDA offers as forming the basis for its sampling banare already precluded by the Code.118  <p>	A similar problem is presented by FDA's reliance on the Institute ofMedicine's discussion of sampling.  ]<tt>See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,326.IOM's discussion of the tobacco industry's "voluntary code" describes a"crowded public place" scenario,</tt>"#fn272" [119drawn from the 1988 Davis and Jason study, which has been rendered obsolete forthe cigarette manufacturers by the 1990 change in their voluntary code.  TheIOM's entire discussion in this regard, which FDA quotes at length, istherefore inapposite with respect to the cigarette manufacturers.<p>	FDA has offered no sufficient justification for prohibiting the distributionof cigarette samples.  As applied to the cigarette manufacturers, the ban is asolution in search of a problem.  Its principal effect would be to preventcigarette samples from being distributed to adults, and it would (if broadlyinterpreted) prohibit the gift of complimentary packages in business, trade, orsimilar settings that do not raise the issue the rule is meant to address.  <p>]<p><tt><b>	4.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	Sampling has been held to be a form of commercial speech protected by theFirst Amendment.  See Board of Trusteesv. Fox, 492U.S. 469 (1989) ("Tupperware parties" constitute commercial speech protected bythe First Amendment).  To justify restrictions on commercial speech under theFirst Amendment, the government "'must demonstrate that the harms it recitesare real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a materialdegree.'"

FDAhas not demonstrated, and cannot demonstrate, that cigarette sampling presentsa real problem of youth access, or that a ban on cigarette sampling is requiredto address any youth-accessissue that may be presented in unusual cases.  For these reasons, the proposedban on cigarette sampling would violate the First Amendment.

See60 Fed. Reg. 41,326.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that this regulation is designed to implementSection502(e)(2) of the FDCA.  In fact, the regulation is precluded bythe ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992 (as discussed in the General Commentssection), is unnecessary, and would produce anomalous results.  </tt><p><tt>	First, cigarettes already are required to be labeled "cigarettes"under regulations adopted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmspursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.  See 27 C.F.R.[[section]]270.215 (1995).</tt>"#fn273" [120Consumers certainly do not need yet another product identification to tell themthat what they have in hand is cigarettes.  There is no evidence that anyone isconfused <p>about what is inside currently distributed packages of cigarettes."Cigarettes" is already the common and usual name for the product.  There is noneed to designate an "established name."]Second, as noted above, Section897.3(a) apparently woulddefine "cigarettes" to include little cigars.  Under BATF regulations, however,little cigars must be labeled either "small cigars" or "little cigars."See 27 C.F.R. [[section]] 270.214(c) (1995).  Thus, the same package oflittle cigars that must be labeled "small cigars" or "little cigars" (undercurrent BATF regulations) would also have to carry the established name of"cigarettes" (under the proposed FDA regulation).  Such a conflicting labelingrequirement is absurd, and would create confusion where none now exists.Moreover, since little cigars are not cigarettes, compelling littlecigar manufacturers to call them "cigarettes" is arbitrary and capricious.Finally, the rule would force manufacturers of little cigars to violate yetanother proposed rule, Section897.36, which prohibits "false ormisleading" labeling or advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoproducts.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]] 897.29--Educational Programs Concerning Cigarettesand</b></tt><p><tt>          <b>Smokeless Tobacco Products</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Section897.29 would require each cigarette andsmokeless tobacco product manufacturer to establish and maintain "an effectivenational public educational program to discourage persons under 18 years of agefrom using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products."  Each manufacturer wouldbe required to allocate for such a program an amount proportionate to its shareof total advertising and promotional expenditures for the most recent yearreported by all manufacturers to the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to theFCLAA and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986.The "total amount" to be spent on the program would be $150 million per year,and the "major portion" of the program must appear on television.  FDAevidently envisions a separate program by each manufacturer.</tt><p><tt>	FDA contemplates that 80 percent of the $150million would be spenton television messages and the remaining 20 percent on messages in other media,"with emphasis on radio and outdoor advertising."  See 60 Fed. Reg.41,328.  FDA's discussion of the basis for its $150million figuresuggests that this amount includes only the cost of air time oradvertising space.  It does not appear, therefore, that the $150 million wouldinclude the costs associated with producing the messages, conducting semiannualtracking studies, or preparing the quarterly analyses the Agency says might berequired to fulfill the manufacturers' obligation "to report on theeffectiveness of the program."  See id.121</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA's stated goal is "to combat the attractive imagery fostered by decadesof tobacco advertising," and the Agency characterizes the educational programas a "remedy."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,326, 41,351.  Even if advertising imagery wereshown to make smoking attractive to young people, FDA has no authority and nolegal grounds under Section502, or any other FDCA provision, to impose a"remedy" or "corrective educational program" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,328), where theprior advertising was not unlawful and the product was not, at the time, evensubject to regulation under the FDCA.  In essence, FDA seeks to establish anex post facto penalty to "remedy" conduct that was notunlawful and that violated no one's legal rights at the time it was undertaken.The Agency has not cited a single precedent for such action.Section897.29 is contrary to the FDCA and is precluded by the ADAMHAlegislation and the FCLAA (for the reasons discussed in the General Commentssection).  It is also unwarranted and unconstitutional.</tt><p><h3>3.	  Unauthorized by Statute</h3><tt>	FDA has no authority under the FDCA to require even a properly regulatedcompany to pay money for any purpose-- even for continuingviolations of the FDCA-- except when special legislation has conferredsuch authority on FDA in specified circumstances.  No such special legislationauthorizes FDA's proposed requirement that cigarette manufacturers pay for anational educational program.</tt><p><tt>	For example, to require private firms to pay for FDA to hire additionalemployees to review new drug applications --a task plainly within FDA's core mission --the Agency went to Congress for legislation requiring firms submitting suchapplications to pay user fees; and Congress enacted such legislation.See Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-571,106 Stat. 4491 (1992).  Similarly, in its 1995 budget submission to Congress,FDA asked for legislation to establish user fees for reviews of applicationsfor approval of medical devices.  See Agriculture, Rural Development,Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1996:Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Appropriations, 104thCong., 1st Sess. 760-78(1995).  Congress has not yet enacted a statute authorizing medical device userfees.  Consequently, FDA has no authority to require payment of them.  To ourknowledge, neither FDA nor anyone else has ever suggested that the Agency mayimpose such fees without congressional authorization.</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, special legislation was needed to authorize FDA to impose civilpenalties on device manufacturers and manufacturers of generic drugs for humanuse.  See Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 [[section]]17,Pub.L. No.101-629, 104Stat. 4511, 4526 (1990); Generic DrugEnforcement Act of 1992 [[section]]3, Pub.L. No.102-282,106Stat. 149, 159 (1992).  Absent such specific legislation, FDA has noauthority-- under the FDCA or otherwise-- to impose civilpenalties.  Thus, it may not impose penalties against manufacturers of pioneer(i.e., nongeneric) drugs for human or veterinary use, genericdrugs for veterinary use, foods, or cosmetics because no civil penaltiesauthority has been conferred by Congress.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, even where the actions of manufacturers (i.e.,submissions of new drug applications) create a burden on FDA and themanufacturer directly benefits from FDA's actions (i.e., fromFDA's approval of their applications), FDA cannot impose a correspondingcompensatory financial obligation on the manufacturers.  Similarly, even when amanufacturer violates the FDCA, FDA cannot impose a civil monetary penalty.  Insum, without special legislation, FDA has no authority to command a regulatedcompany to pay money for any purpose.</tt><p><tt>	The basis for imposing a financial requirement on cigarette manufacturersis clearly much weaker than the bases FDA advanced to Congress in support ofuser fees and civil penalties.  Here, cigarette manufacturers have not imposedany administrative burden on FDA, do not receive any benefit from FDA'sactions, and have not violated the FDCA.  The dispositive consideration,however, is that Congress has not enacted any special legislation authorizingFDA to impose any financial requirement on cigarette manufacturers.  Therefore,FDA has no such authority.</tt><p><tt>	Nor is there any statutory basis, or any precedent, for FDA's plan torequire cigarette manufacturers to undertake a national public educationprogram to discourage the use of their own products.  The Agencydescribes the program as a "corrective educational program" aimed at"combat[ting] the effects of the pervasive and positive imagery that has fordecades helped to foster a youth market for tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg.41,326, 41,328.  However, FDA's reliance on FDCA Sections520(e), 502, and201(n) to support this proposal, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,351, is unavailing.  </tt><p><tt>	The Agency cannot rely on Section520(e) because no aspect of theproposed educational program can reasonably be characterized as a restrictionon the "sale, distribution, or use" of a medical device.  Furthermore, sincethe program cannot be justified as a Section520(e) restriction, theAgency may not invoke the misbranding provision ofSection502(q)(2).</tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to mandate, on a prescribed schedule, televised messages,radio messages, and outdoor advertising, with a required content intended todiscourage youth smoking.  FDA claims there is a precedent for such action:  Itasserts that it has imposed "a similar educational requirement for hearingaids," which are restricted devices.  60Fed. Reg. 41,351.  That assertionis manifestly incorrect.</tt><p><tt>	No television, radio, billboard or any other advertising is required withrespect to hearing aids.  No messages intended to discourage use are mandated.Nothing remotely akin to FDA's proposed national educational program isprescribed.  </tt><p><tt>	Instead, FDA has specified requirements for the labeling of thedevices (i.e., the User Instructional Brochure), and has mandatedthat the labeling be made available in direct and immediate connection with andprior to the sale of the device to the potential user.  Moreover, this labelingphysically accompanies the hearing aid and is provided directly by thedispenser of the hearing aid to the customer.  See 21 C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]801.420, 801.421 (1995).  Thus, these are labelingrequirements under FDCA Section502 and conditions for sale underSection520(e) that are aimed at ensuring the safe and effective use ofthe device by the identified potential user.  </tt><p><tt>	In contrast, Section897.29 would mandate a nationwide educationalprogram, aired to the general public--i.e., personshaving no connection with any particular sales transaction-- in an effortto prevent the program's intended audience (persons under the age of 18)from becoming or continuing to be users.  FDA's program is notintended to promote safe and effective use of cigarettes by currentsmokers.</tt><p><tt>	More generally, Section520(e) cannot properly be read as authorizingFDA to impose, as a condition on the distribution or sale of a product toperson A, that a manufacturer provide to person B informationintended to discourage person B from using the product.  In the nearly90 years of food and drug law, there is no precedent for such arequirement.</tt><p><tt>	In 1976, Congress did, indeed, address FDA's authority with respect to theadvertising of restricted devices, and in Section502(r) it gave FDAcertain new authority over such advertising.  Section502(r), however,does not include any authority to require advertising.  It is simplyinconceivable that a device-- even a restricted device-- could bemisbranded under any provision of Section502 because it was notadvertised (or because it was not the subject of advertising ontelevision or radio, or because additional advertising with respect to it wasnot placed on television, radio, and billboards).</tt>"#fn274" [122<p>	Where a device is safe for use by people of type]<tt>A(e.g., adults or cardiologists) but not safe for use by people oftypeB (e.g., children or family physicians),Congress intended and authorized FDA to use tools other than mandatoryadvertising (which Congress never even considered) to prevent use by people oftypeB (for example, by imposing a prescription requirement andadvising physicians through labeling that the device is not safe for people oftypeB, or by directly restricting distribution, sale, and use tohospitals).  There is no evidence that Congress intended that FDA haveauthority to address that kind of problem by requiring a regulated party to payfor an advertising program.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cites, as supposed precedents, its requirements for "specified userinformation" for other devices, including the Shiley heart valve, siliconebreast implants, and certain childhood immunizations.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,351.Again, the "specified user information" in these situations is labelingaccompanying the product, not a nationwide educational program on televisionand radio addressed to an audience most of whom have no intent to use thereferenced product.  The required user information cited by FDA is directed topersons who have been individually identified by physicians as patients forwhom the products are indicated and likely to provide a medical benefit; andthe purpose of the labeling is to make a product safe for its actualusers or to give them information about an existing health condition, notto discourage them from future use.  Thus, these "precedents" provide nosupport whatever for FDA's proposed national advertising program to discouragea target audience from using cigarettes at all.  </tt><p><tt>	Nothing in Section502(q) authorizes a requirement of the type FDAhas proposed.  Section502(q) provides that the advertising of arestricted device cannot be false or misleading in any particular.  FDA thus isauthorized to assure that the content of advertising that the manufacturerchooses to disseminate is truthful and not misleading.  FDA does notpropose to require the cigarette manufacturers to include the specifiededucational messages in their advertising as a means of ensuring truthfulness.Indeed, cigarettes may not be advertised on television or radio, 15 U.S.C.[[section]]1335, so the proposed mandatory television and radio messagescould not be justified as a necessary part of an "advertising" message ineither of those media under either Section502(q) or Section201(n).</tt><p><tt>	Section502(r) requires the advertising of a restricted device tocontain a brief statement of "the intended uses of the device and relevantwarnings."  21U.S.C. [[section]]352(r)(2).  Again, this requirementapplies to any advertising the manufacturer chooses to disseminate.  Itis not a basis to affirmatively require advertising or any other publicstatement.  Moreover, because cigarettes cannot be advertised on television orradio, FDA's proposed educational program cannot be justified underSection502(r) on this basis either.  </tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the brief statement's purpose is to reflect a fair balancebetween a product's benefits (indications, intended uses) and its risks(relevant warnings).  21 C.F.R. [[section]]202.1(e)(5)(ii) (1995).  Anypresentation of "benefits" of cigarettes on television or radio by themanufacturers would constitute "advertising" and would violate 15U.S.C.[[section]]1335.  Therefore no "brief statement" could properly bepresented.  The advertising FDA proposes to require would thus not be a "briefstatement," and therefore authority for the proposed requirement cannot befound in Section502(r).</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal that cigarette manufacturers select "messages maintained byFDA" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,327) is likewise entirely without legal basis.Section502(r) authorizes FDA to require advertising to include onlydefined categories of information, and not more.  Although in certain cases FDAmay review advertising, it cannot dictate or require advertising.  For example,under Section502(r), FDA may require prior approval "of the content ofany advertisement" of a restricted device, but only "in extraordinarycircumstances."  However, even if cigarettes presented an extraordinarycircumstance-- which they do not-- FDA may not mandate anadvertising program.  It can only review and approve an advertisement a companymay chose to put forward.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, Section 201(n) cannot support a requirement for an affirmativepublic education program.  Section201(n) is not a grant of authority toFDA.  Rather, it defines the scope of circumstances, most notably omissions ofmaterial fact, that FDA may evaluate in determining whether a product'slabeling or advertising is misleading.  It lists these representations andomissions that are to "be taken into account."  Moreover, Section201(n)comes into play only when a product "is alleged to be misbranded" because ofmisleading labeling or advertising.  There is no underlying alleged misbrandingconcerning cigarette advertising or promotions.  </tt><p><tt>	Never before has FDA suggested that it may compel a manufacturer todisseminate over communications media that reach the general public messagesdiscouraging the use of a lawful product to counter "positive" imagery used inproduct advertising.  Although a few FDA-regulated companies have agreed toconduct "corrective advertising programs" to correct violations of FDArequirements, there has been no predicate violation here, and the cigarettecompanies have not agreed to undertake a "voluntary" program.  FDA purports toimpose it as a legal requirement.  Such a requirement is unauthorized by theFDCA and unprecedented in the history of food and drug law.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA has no authority, in any circumstance, to require correctiveadvertising, even to remedy past false or misleading advertising.  The schemeof remedies authorized by the FDCA with respect to drugs and devices is setforth in FDCA [[section]][[section]]301-307,516, 518, 21 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]331-337,360f, 360h (1994).  Where an FDA-regulatedfirm has disseminated false or misleading advertising or has otherwise violatedthe statute, FDA's remedies are the ones specified in those provisions of thestatute --and those provisions do not include mandatory corrective advertising.  FDA hasnever before even tried to order corrective advertising.</tt><p><tt>	Even the Federal Trade Commission's corrective advertising doctrine hasnever been construed to deal with imagery, as FDA proposes to do.  The courtshave held that the Federal Trade Commission's corrective advertising orders maynot go "beyond elimination of the specific misrepresentations which were made[or] beyond what in fairness could be deemed necessary to deter future unlawfulconduct."  Standard Oil Co.v. FTC, 577 F.2d 653, 662 (9thCir. 1978).  "A remedy for deceptive advertising which is broader than isnecessary to prevent future deception or correct past deception isimpermissible under the First Amendment."  Encyclopedia Britannica,Inc.v. FTC, 605F.2d 964, 972 (7th Cir. 1979),cert. denied, 445 U.S. 934 (1980).  See alsoBeneficial Corp.v. FTC, 542 F.2d 611, 618-20 (3d Cir.1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 983 (1977).  </tt><p><tt>	Thus, for example, in 1977 the D.C. Circuit modified a "corrective"advertising order issued by the FTC because the self-criticism that the FTC hadordered the advertiser to include in its future advertising could not bejustified.  Warner-Lambert Co.v. FTC, 562 F.2d 749, 763(D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 950 (1978).  InNational Comm'n on Egg Nutritionv. FTC, 570 F.2d 157 (7thCir. 1977), cert.<i> </i>denied, 439 U.S. 821 (1978), the SeventhCircuit similarly invalidated another FTC affirmative disclosure order becauseit was "broader than. . . necessary to prevent... orcorrect the effects of past deception."  570F.2d at 164.  Seealso United Statesv. NSPE, 555F.2d 978, 984(D.C. Cir. 1977), aff'd on other grounds,435U.S. 679, 686 n.8 (1978).  </tt><p><tt>	Tobacco product advertising is not deceptive merely by virtue of thethemes and images it employs.</tt>"#fn278" [123Moreover, statutory health warnings appear on tobacco product packages and intobacco product advertising.  These health messages are declared to be"adequate" as a matter of federal law.  ]<tt>See 15 U.S.C.[[section]]1331.  No advertising could be less "deceptive" thanadvertising required to carry government-mandatedmessages such as those required in tobacco product advertising.  As the NinthCircuit ruled in an opinion by then-JudgeAnthony M. Kennedy, "there is no deception... unless thepublic holds a belief contrary to material facts not disclosed."FTCv. Simeon Management Corp., 532F.2d 708, 716 (9thCir. 1976) (emphasis added).  As discussed above, virtually all Americans,young and old alike, believe smoking is dangerous.</tt><p><tt>	Even if FDA had authority to require corrective advertising (and it doesnot), it could not order such advertising here.  Corrective advertising may notbe required where, as here, it is not "reasonably related" to some violation ofa statute.  See ITT Continental Baking Co.v. FTC,532 F.2d 207, 220 (2d Cir. 1976) (setting aside portions of an overbroad FTCcease and desist order directed at advertiser).  The perpetual, image-based,counteradvertising campaign envisioned in Section897.29 is not reasonablyrelated to any act that is unlawful under the FDCA (or that was unlawful whenundertaken).  The "correction" is required even if a manufacturer has in thepast never violated any provision of the FDCA and obeys all of FDA's proposedrules in the future.</tt><p><tt>	As one court has said in rejecting the FTC's claim of such authority toimpose open-ended obligations:</tt><p><tt>"Even if we give effect to the broadest possible concept of the powerconferred by the Congress upon the Commission, we do not think that the [FTC]has the power... to do whatever is considered by it to begood and beneficial.  The task assigned it by Congress is specific, and it hasno other authority in respect to this subject."  Albertyv.FTC, 182 F.2d 36, 38-39 (D.C. Cir. 1949), cert. denied,340 U.S. 818 (1950).</tt><p><p><tt>That court therefore struck down an FTC requirement that a drugmanufacturer provide additional information about the limitations on thebenefits of its product.  </tt><p><tt>	In so doing, the Alberty court recognized the implications of theFTC's assertion of power to require disclosures unrelated to a violation of thelaw.  The court held:</tt><p><tt>"If [the FTC] has this power, it could, if it chose, require an advertiserof a breakfast food rich in iron to state not only that the food is good forthose deficient in iron but also that iron deficiency is less frequent thanother ills and that for these others the advertised food is valueless; andsimilarly through the long list of foods, drugs, and drinks good for one or afew of the ills of men but not for all."  Id. at 39.</tt><p><p><tt>This statement applies with equal (indeed, greater) force to FDA, whichlacks any authority to order corrective advertising.  </tt><p><tt>	The unprecedented authority FDA asserts in its proposal to requireantismoking advertising is truly astonishing.  Advertising for FDA-regulatedproducts commonly utilizes positive imagery.</tt>"#fn292" [124  By FDA's reasoning, it could requiremanufacturers of any product the Agency deems to be overused or lacking insocial utility to disseminate "corrective" messages to discourage product use.By this logic, the Agency could require producers of potato chips and jellybeans to pay for advertising discouraging the use of ]<tt>theirproducts, since these foods are lacking in nutritional value and are promotedby manufacturers using positive imagery.  See 21 C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]101.14 (a)(5), (e)(3), (e)(6) (1995).  Indeed, FDAcould use this rationale to require any manufacturer of any FDA-regulatedproduct to undertake educational programs.  Such a requirement is unsupportedby the statute.</tt>"#fn296" [125<p>	The fact that sales of cigarettes to persons under age 18 are unlawful underState law does not provide FDA with authority to require cigarettemanufacturers to pay for advertising to discourage such purchases.  Noprovision in the FDCA authorizes FDA to require regulated firms to pay foradvertising to discourage unlawful use of, or other unlawful activities inconnection with, their products.  Two examples make the point.<p>	Some drugs regulated by FDA are subject to severe restrictions under theControlled Substances Act ("CSA"), 21 U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]801n-904.  Yet FDA has no authority to requiremanufacturers of controlled substances to pay for advertising to discouragedistribution, sale, or use of their products in violation of the CSA.  <p>	Diversion of drugs regulated by FDA from their proper channels of distributionviolates FDCA Section 503(c)-(e). 21 U.S.C. [[section]]353(c)-(e)(1994).  FDA has no authority to require manufacturers of drugs to pay foradvertising to discourage diversion or distribution, sale, or use of drugs thathave been diverted.<p>	Even if it could be found that image advertising by a manufacturer hadinfluenced individuals to engage such illegal (or disapproved) conduct, FDAwould still have no authority to require corrective advertising by themanufacturer; and it would have no basis for any action against themanufacturer under the FDCA unless the image advertising caused the product toviolate the misbranding provisions of the FDCA.<p>	As discussed above, in the case of cigarettes Congress has carefullyconsidered the amount and types of messages that manufacturers may be requiredto disseminate.  In enacting the FCLAA, Congress determined that theappropriate way to address that issue is to require a federally mandatedwarning label on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising.  Indeed, theFCLAA and the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act (and similar federalstatutes) preclude Section897.29.  The specificity with which Congresshas acted with respect to this precise issue bars FDA and any othergovernmental agency from relying on general authority to impose an additional"solution."  ]<tt>Railway Labor Executives Ass'nv.

FDA's attempts to invoke past labeling requirements to justifySection897.29 are unavailing.  Such a regulation falls far outside thepurposes of the FDCA and the boundaries of FDA's authority.</tt>"#fn302" [126  <p>]<h3>4.	  Unjustified</h3><tt>	As discussed in our General Comments section, the cigarette manufacturers,individually and through The Tobacco Institute, have undertaken a variety ofeducational programs aimed at discouraging underage smoking.  Unlike themessage FDA seeks to convey, however, the ultimate message of the industry'sprograms has not been that no one should ever smoke, but that smoking isinappropriate behavior for persons under the age of 18.  Of course, unlike theprogram FDA seeks to impose, the industry programs are voluntary.</tt><p><tt>	In any event, a public educational campaign is unnecessary to persuadeyoung people of the health risks associated with smoking.  More than 15 yearsago, the Surgeon General stated, "[b]y the time they reach seventh grade, thevast majority of children believe smoking is dangerous to one's health."</tt>"#fn317" [127  Of 895 children and adolescents questionedin a 1981-1982survey, over 98 percent said they believe smoking is harmful and "named one ormore body parts that are adversely affected by smoking."128  More recentsurveys confirm that this remains true today.  The 1992 Gallup Report, Teen-AgeAttitudes and Behavior Concerning Tobacco, reports that 99 percent of all teensbelieve that smoking is harmful to their health.129  Adolescents actuallybelieve smoking to be more dangerous than the Surgeon General maintains.130  Areport prepared for the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at ColumbiaUniversity concluded:  "American children and their elders agree:  Cigarettesmoking poses a serious health threat, and those who smoke do so at their ownperil... ."  The concerted anti-smokingcampaign of the last two decades seems to have successfully stigmatizedsmoking.131<p>	A new national program, predominantly using television, is not necessary toconvey to young people the message that smoking is inappropriate behavior forpersons under the age of 18.  Antismoking messages are taught to our nation'schildren at every level in school.  A 1989 survey by the National School BoardsAssociation found districtwide antismoking programs in 78 percent of the highschools, 81 percent of the middle and junior high schools, and 75 percent ofthe elementary schools.  According to NSBA, this represents a "significantincrease" since 1986.132<p>	FDA's rationale for its proposed requirement is defective in severaladditional ways.]<h4>(a)	  FDA overstates the likely effects of its proposed antismoking campaign.</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA points to the antismoking advertising campaigns undertakenpursuant to the Fairness Doctrine, and campaigns undertaken by California,Vermont, and Greece, as demonstrating the effectiveness of such programs.  Withthe possible exception of the Vermont campaign (which was not statewide),however, in each case the evidence is inconclusive or actually contrary toFDA's view.  </tt><h6>a.	  Fairness Doctrine.  Citing an analysis performed by William L. Simonich,"#fn325" [133 FDA claims that per capita cigaretteconsumption in the United States declined 7.0 percent between 1967 and 1970,and that 6.2 percent of the decline is "attributable" to the antismokingtelevision advertisements that were run during that period under the FairnessDoctrine.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,327.134  ]</h6><tt>	As Simonich himself noted, however, researchers in the field are splitalmost evenly on whether Fairness Doctrine antismoking advertising wassignificantly associated with declining consumption.</tt>"#fn328" [135  FDA does not acknowledge, much lessaddress, the equivocal nature of this research; instead, the Agency simplycredited the results that furnished a rationale for its proposal.  Asdemonstrated in the Barents Study, moreover, Simonich's own data, properlyinterpreted, do not show that Fairness Doctrine advertising accounted for morethan a 0.4 percent decline in consumption (out of a total decline of 7percent).136  Taken as a whole, therefore, Simonich's analysis does not meetFDA's general standard for a showing of effectiveness.  ]<tt>See 21C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]314.126, 860.7 (standards of scientificevidence to show the effectiveness of an intervention).</tt><p><tt>	The Agency suggests that these same Fairness Doctrine advertisements alsowere responsible for a decline in smoking rates among adolescents during thatperiod.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,327.  However, according to the Surgeon General, thepercentage of "current regular smokers" among teenage males (ages 12 to 18)actually increased between 1968 and 1970, the period during which theFairness Doctrine antismoking advertising was broadcast.</tt>"#fn339" [137  The percentage of "current regularsmokers" among teenage females (ages 12 to 18) ]<tt>similarlyincreased between 1968 and 1970, and among older teenage females (ages 15to 18) smoking prevalence continued to increase between 1970 and 1972.</tt>"#fn342" [138  FDA's basic premise in relying on theFairness Doctrine experience-- that it was associated with a decline inyouth smoking-- is unfounded.<p>	Even the researchers cited by FDA in this connection questioned whetherantismoking advertising could be effective in reducing teenage smoking afterthe end of the initial period, when "the rate of change in antismokinginformation is extremely large."139   The researchers cautioned that, after the"initial shock" caused by the messages, the impact of antismoking messages onteenagers is subject to diminishing returns.140  In view of the pervasivenessof the antismoking messages that reach young people today in school andelsewhere, it seems highly unlikely that a new television campaign would havethe effect predicted by FDA.]<h6>b.	  California.  FDA also relies on California's experience as support for theeducational program required in proposed Section897.29.  60 Fed. Reg.41,327.  California's experience, however, actually confirms that televisedantismoking campaigns do not influence youth smoking.</h6><tt><b>	</b>	Between 1989 and 1994, the State spent $72.9 million onhard-hitting antismoking media campaigns.</tt>"#fn345" [141  According to a 1994 report prepared forthe California Department of Health Services, "[t]he size and scope of theCalifornia antitobacco mass media campaign is unprecedented in the field ofhealth promotion."142  Despite this barrage, 12- to 17-year-oldsmoking prevalence remained steady between 1990 and 1993, and actually]<tt>increased from 9.1percent in 1993 to 10.9 percent in1994-- a 20 percent increase in a single year.</tt>"#fn348" [143]<tt></tt><h6>c.	  Greece.  FDA claims that a government antismoking campaign in Greece inthe late 1970s, which included as one component an antismoking television andradio campaign, virtually halted the increase in per capita cigaretteconsumption during the two years in which the campaign was conducted.60Fed. Reg. 41,327."#fn356" [144  According tothe researchers cited by FDA, consumption again began to rise after thecampaign was abandoned.  As noted, however, the antismoking television andradio campaign was only one element of a broader campaign, and therefore it isnot possible to say what impact (if any) the media campaign's introduction (orits termination) had on consumption.  Yet, again, FDA relies on a causalinference that is scientifically unwarranted.  In no other circumstances wouldFDA conclude that an intervention was effective on the basis of such flimsydata and slipshod analysis.]</h6><tt>	On this, as on other topics addressed in this rulemaking, the Agency'scharacterization of reports of scientific studies is often incomplete andmisleading.  The Agency disregards reports of studies that do not support itsproposals (just as it disregards legal authorities that are contrary to, orotherwise do not support, its legal position).  Where reports do contain somefindings or conclusions that support the Agency's position, the Agency selectsthose findings or conclusions and disregards others that limit or qualify them.In citing and discussing studies, the Agency fails to mention obviousmethodological deficiencies in the studies it relies on (e.g.,lack of a control group, lack of measures to prevent bias), and in someinstances it places reliance on studies that are obviously biased, based onfallacious reasoning, based on an unrepresentative sample, or otherwise flawed.Moreover, the Agency extrapolates from, and generalizes the results of, studiesfar beyond what their circumstances warrant; and, in interpreting studies, itdiscusses and adopts only interpretations that support its position withouteven considering other interpretations that are equally or moreplausible.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, contrary to its usual practice, the Agency's use of the scientificliterature in this rulemaking reflects not a fair-minded, impartial analysis,but rather a biased and selective review driven by a demand to support apredetermined position.  By this approach, the Agency jeopardizes itsscientific credibility.</tt><p><tt>	None of the studies FDA relies on to show the effectiveness of a nationaleducational program in reducing the rate of smoking by youths comes close tosatisfying FDA's own standards for an adequate and well-controlledstudy or for valid scientific evidence used to show the effectiveness of anintervention.  See 21 C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]314.126, 860.7(1995).  FDA has refrained from subjecting these studies to the kind ofrigorous and critical scrutiny that it routinely applies to studies relied onby regulated firms to show the effectiveness of interventions involving theirproducts, or to other studies submitted to the Agency for consideration inregulatory decisionmaking.</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, in several instances the authors of these studies have reachedconclusions contrary to the inferences the Agency asserts the studies support,and the Agency simply disregards those conclusions.  In several instances, theAgency disregards limitations, qualifications or uncertainties stated by thestudies' authors with respect to conclusions that the Agency relies on.Moreover, the Agency disregards established empirical facts which must be takeninto account in order properly and fairly to assess the reported results of thestudies.</tt><h4>	(c)	  FDA does not seriously attempt to justify the $150 million price tag forthe proposed educational program.  </h4><tt>	The $150 million price tag FDA attaches to its proposed educationalprogram is three times the $50 million amount that was deemed"sufficient" for a similar program under legislation sponsored by SenatorKennedy and approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1990and 1991.</tt>"#fn358" [145  Senator Kennedy's programpresupposed, moreover, that "image" advertising would continue to be allowed.<p>	FDA plainly recognizes the need to justify its $150 million figure, but thatfigure, in truth, appears to have been picked out of a hat.  It reflects alegislative and political judgment, not the application of technical expertisepursuant to a statutory standard.

Reg. 41,328.  FDA, however, does not provide any source forthis "estimate," but indicates merely that it was derived from the cost ofcommercial air time during that period.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,327.</tt>"#fn359" [146  Under the Fairness Doctrine, however,broadcasters who accepted cigarette advertisements were required to providefree air time to broadcast antismoking messages.147  Neither the cigarettemanufacturers nor the antismoking groups were required to pay for the broadcastof the antismoking messages.<p>	FDA offers no support for its crucial, but unstated, assumption that thecommercial value of the air time provided for the Fairness Doctrine antismokingmessages is the appropriate benchmark (subject to adjustments for inflation)for the requirements it plans to impose.  Indeed, FDA's reliance on FairnessDoctrine antismoking advertising as a precedent is misplaced.  The FairnessDoctrine is scarcely more of a precedent than the Monroe Doctrine for therequirement that FDA has proposed.]First, the Fairness Doctrine referred to the obligation ofbroadcasters to present "contrasting viewpoints" on controversialissues, in view of their statutory status as "public fiduciaries" obliged tobroadcast in the public interest.  Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of theCommission's Rules and Regulations Concerning the General Fairness DoctrineObligation of Licensees, 102 F.C.C.2d 142, 146-47 (1985) ("1985 FairnessReport").  See, e.g., Friends of the Earth v.FCC, 449 F.2d 1164, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 1971); Banzhaf v. FCC,405 F.2d 1082, 1086 (D.C. Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 842(1969).  The doctrine did not refer to some obligation of advertisers to"counteract" the putative influence of their own advertising.</tt><p><tt>	Second, the Fairness Doctrine required broadcasters to presentopposing sides of a controversial issue only if they broadcast one side oranother.  If they did not broadcast one, they did not have to broadcast anyothers.  1985 Fairness Report, 102 F.C.C.2d at 142, 159-61. Thus, when cigarette advertising was banned, the Fairness Doctrine no longerrequired the broadcasters to air antismoking messages.  The fact thatcigarettes continued to be advertised in other media cannot justify, byreference to the Fairness Doctrine, FDA's requirement that antismoking messagesagain be broadcast on television and radio.</tt>"#fn361" [148]Third, as an obligation imposed on broadcasters to present"contrasting views," the Fairness Doctrine was held not to constitute anunconstitutional interference with editorial freedom because of the specialstatus of the broadcast media under the First Amendment.  See RedLion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969).  The FirstAmendment otherwise has been held not to permit government to require privateparties to carry the messages of other private parties against their will,Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), orto speak against their will, e.g., Pacific Gas&amp;Electric Co.v. Public Utility Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 13(1986); Ibanezv. Florida Bd. of Accountancy, 114S.Ct. 2084 (1994), except to prevent or remedy deception.  SeeVirginia State Bd. of Pharmacyv. Virginia Citizens ConsumerCouncil, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771-72 n.24 (1976); In re R.M.J., 455U.S. 191, 201 (1982); Zauderer re Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471U.S. 626, 651 (1985).  FDA does not attempt to justify, and could not justify,Section 897.29 as a means of preventing or remedying deception.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.  Syracuse PeaceCouncil v. WTUH, 2 F.C.C. Rcd. 5043 (1987), aff'd sub.nom. Syracuse Peace Council v. FCC, 867 F.2d 654 (D.C.Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1019 (1990).  Citing thechanges in the electronic media marketplace, the FCC ruled that the FairnessDoctrine "violates the First Amendment and contravenes the public interest."  2F.C.C. Rcd. 5043, at [[paragraph]]2.  FDA now proposes to require thecigarette manufacturers to pay for the antismoking messages in a retroactiveapplication of a doctrine that the FCC itself rejected on First Amendmentgrounds-- a doctrine originally applied to broadcasters only because oftheir special status under the First Amendment.</tt><p><tt>	In any event, the $75 million in air time supposedly provided bybroadcasters each year pursuant to the Fairness Doctrine appears to be utterlyunrelated to the $150 million proposed by FDA for its program.  FDA does saythat the $75 million worth of air time supposedly provided each year in thelate 1960s "translates" into $290 million in 1994 dollars.  The Agency thenmerely offers the ipse dixit that "approximately half thatamount, or $150 million a year," would "ensure an effective program."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,328.  There is no scientific basis for that assertion.  The Agency, inshort, offers nothing in support of its $150 million figure beyond its ownassertion that this is the right amount.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, FDA provides no scientifically rigorous criteria for"effectiveness," as it would for any other intervention it was assessing.  Itoffers no scientifically valid justification for the proposed campaign as anecessary addition to the proposed initiatives to reduce youth access and theproposed restrictions on advertising and production.  Indeed, FDA plainly hasno clear idea of the separate contributions it expects its individualinitiatives to make to the overall goal of reducing smoking by youth.  Instead,the Agency is imposing on private parties multiple costs and burdens in thehope that somehow they will contribute to the overall goal.  </tt><p><tt>	In our constitutional system, the democratically elected Congress and theState legislatures have the authority to impose costs and burdens on such abasis, but an unelected regulatory agency does not.  This lack of authority isespecially glaring where, as here, the agency is acting without specificstatutory guidance or findings and without an ascertainable statutorystandard.</tt><h4>(d)	  The funding formula for Section897.29 functions as a penalty forcurrent advertising.</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA's proposal would allow a manufacturer to avoid the obligationto contribute to the Agency's program by forgoing advertising and promotion,and to shift all the costs of the program to manufacturers that continued toengage in such activities.  The funding formula thus is structured to be, ineffect, a tax levied directly, explicitly and solely on current expendituresfor lawful advertising and promotion to adults, and would function as a penaltyfor engaging in such advertising and promotion (as well as functioning, inconcept, as a penalty for having engaged in advertising and promotion in thepast).  Moreover, such current expenditures do not necessarily bear anyrelation to past image advertising or to responsibility for contributing to the"image" of smoking that FDA says it seeks to counter.  Thus, FDA has notestablished in the record any rational connection between the past conduct ofindividual companies and the present and future costs to them of theadvertising program FDA proposes.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b></tt><h3>5.	  Unconstitutional</h3><tt>	FDA may not force the cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers toconduct and pay for such a program.  </tt><p><tt>	The Agency's attempt to expropriate millions of dollars from manufacturersto fund antitobacco campaigns violates the First Amendment and the FifthAmendment.  The proposal is also a blatant attempt to do indirectly what theAgency cannot do directly.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA has no authority to collect private monies from private parties tofund the Agency's own activities.  FDA also has no authority to levy taxes.Furthermore, in the absence of specific authorizing legislation, FDA may notlevy civil penalties.</tt>"#fn365" [149  <p>	Here, however, rather than ask Congress to appropriate the funds-- theonly constitutionally permissible mechanism for accomplishing its desiredgoal-- FDA seeks unconstitutionally to evade the limits on its access topublic money by ordering private citizens to fund its projects directly.  ]<h4>(a)	  First Amendment</h4><tt>	For the reasons stated in greater detail in the memorandum prepared byFloyd Abrams, Esq., and John Donnellan, Esq., which accompanies and is a partof these comments (see VolumeIX), Section897.29 wouldviolate the First Amendment.</tt><p><tt>	Section 897.32(c) would violate the First Amendment because its purposeand function are not to prevent cigarette advertising from being deceptive, butinstead to compel cigarette manufacturers to provide a vehicle fordisseminating FDA-sponsored antismoking messages.  In effect, Section 897.29 isa complement to Section 897.32(c).  Section 897.32(c) would require cigarettemanufacturers to propagandize against the use of their products within the fourcorners of their advertising; Section 897.29 would require the manufacturers topropagandize against the use of their products in stand-alonemessages.</tt><p><tt>	Both requirements would violate the First Amendment.  Indeed, the SecondCircuit has commented on "the patent First Amendment problems" presented by aNew York City ordinance that, just like proposed Section 897.29, would haveconditioned the right to advertise cigarettes on the advertiser's willingnessto run additional antismoking messages.  Vango Media, Inc. v. City ofNew York, 34 F.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir. 1994).</tt><p><tt>	As discussed above, the Supreme Court has long held that speech can becompelled only to prevent or remedy deception.  See Virginia StateBoard of Pharmacy, 425 U.S. 748, 771-72n.24 (1976) (state may "require that a commercial message appear in such aform, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, asare necessary to prevent its being deceptive") (emphasis added); Inre R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191, 201 (1982) ("warning or disclaimer might beappropriately required...in order to dissipate thepossibility of consumer confusion or deception") (emphasis added);Ibanez v. Florida Board of Accountancy, 114 S. Ct. 2084, 2090(1994) (reserving judgment whether, on another record, the challenged compelledspeech might be justified "as an appropriately tailored check against deceptionor confusion") (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	The Court has also repeatedly held that the First Amendment protectsprivate parties --including corporations --from being forced to disseminate messages of others against their wishes.See Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Public UtilitiesComm'n, 475 U.S. 1 (1986).</tt>"#fn366" [150  TheFirst Amendment protects "both the right to speak freely and the right torefrain from speaking at all."  ]<tt>Wooley v. Maynard, 430U.S. 705, 714 (1977).</tt>"#fn375" [151  It protects aprivate speaker from being forced to disseminate not only hostile ideologies,but also hostile facts.  ]<tt>See Riley v. NationalFederation of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 797-98(1988); see also Ibanez, supra, 114 S. Ct. 2084(1994); Hurley v. Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group,115 S. Ct. 2338, 2347 (1995).</tt>"#fn379" [152<p>	Finally, but not least, Section 897.29 constitutes an impermissible tax onconstitutionally protected speech, based solely on the content of the speech.]<tt>See Grosjeanv. American Press Co., 297 U.S.233, 245-50(1936); Minneapolis Star Tribune Co.v. Minnesota Comm'r ofRevenue, 460 U.S. 575, 581-85(1983); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.v. Ragland, 481 U.S.221, 227-31(1987); Simon &amp; Schusterv. New York State Crime VictimsBd., 502 U.S. 105, 115-16 (1991).  </tt><h4>(b)	  Uncompensated Taking-- Fifth Amendment</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Section897.29 would work an unconstitutional taking ofprivate property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.The proposed rule is a particularly egregious example of FDA's failure toconduct a takings-sensitive analysis of its proposed regulations as required byExecutive Order 12,630, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (1988).  Indeed, FDA does not evencomment on this proposed regulation's interference with constitutionallyprotected property rights.  Whether characterized as a confiscation of privatemonies or as a destruction of the economically beneficial use of the funds ofmanufacturers, Section897.29 is a taking per se.153</tt><h6>a.		FDA's Expropriation of $150 Million</h6><tt>				<b>Constitutes a Per Se Taking        </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section897.29 effectively seizes the private monies of manufacturersin order to accomplish FDA's purposes.  The regulation dictates in detail howmanufacturers are to dispose of $150 million of their funds.  This wouldconstitute a complete confiscation of the funds, no less than if FDA were toexpropriate the funds from manufacturers' bank accounts and spend the moneyitself.  In either case, the Agency has assumed complete and permanent controlof the property.</tt><p><tt>	The seizure of private funds such as that effected by the Agency'sregulation constitutes a per se taking.  In Webb's FabulousPharmaciesv. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155 (1980), the Supreme Courtaddressed the constitutionality of a State law that permitted a county to claimfor itself the interest that had accrued on certain private funds deposited inthe registry of a local court.  The Court held that the county's seizure ofthese monies represented a "forced contribution" by those citizens who haddeposited funds in the registry, and therefore was an unconstitutional takingwithout compensation.  Significantly, the Court compared the taking of theaccrued interest to a form of physical invasion.  Id. at 163-64.</tt><p><tt>	Courts have long recognized that a taking occurs where a regulation can becharacterized as a physical invasion or confiscation of property.Nollanv. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 832(1987); Kaiser Aetnav. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80(1979).  Judicial scrutiny of such intrusions onto property has traditionallybeen severe, and courts now consider such an intrusion a per setaking.  No additional analysis is required.  Section 897.29 constitutes justsuch a taking.  See<i> </i>Lorettov. TeleprompterManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 426 (1982).  </tt><h6>b.		Destroying the Economically Beneficial</h6><tt><b>				Use of $150 Million Constitutes a </b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Per Se Taking                         </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Like other governmental intrusions that constitute an invasion orconfiscation, regulations that destroy the economically beneficial use ofproperty are considered takings per se.  In such circumstances,compensation is required "without case-specific inquiry into the publicinterest advanced" in support of the regulation.  See<i></i>Lucasv. South Carolina Coastal Council,112S.Ct. 2886, 2893 (1992).</tt><p><tt>	The Court has found a taking in cases where a regulation has imposed onproperty rights in far less intrusive ways than the complete expropriation thatwould be effected by Section897.29.  For example, in KaiserAetnav. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), a U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers regulation effected an unconstitutional taking perse where it permitted the public access to a pond that had, for theprevious decade, been available only to particular residents.Section897.29 goes far beyond the infringement in Kaiser Aetna.FDA would not merely impose limitations on how manufacturers may spendtheir funds; it actually would dictate in precise detail how they mustspend those funds.</tt>"#fn384" [154<p>	If Section897.29 is not struck down on First Amendment or other grounds,the cost of the proposed antismoking campaign ultimately would be borne by thetaxpayers, who would be forced to pay just compensation under the TakingsClause to the manufacturers, indirectly, for the cost of the campaign.  Asdiscussed ]<tt>infra, if FDA wishes taxpayers to finance a $150million antitobacco campaign, it must ask Congress to appropriate funds forsuch an effort.  It may not through a regulatory requirement demand that thesefunds be spent for the FDA-designatedpurpose.</tt><h4>(c)	  Impermissible Tax-- Article I, [[section]][[section]]7, 8</h4><tt>	FDA's attempt through Section897.29 to raise $150 million per yearto finance the Agency's desired antitobacco campaign violates ArticleI ofthe U.S. Constitution.  ArticleI vests the power to tax solely in onebody:  Congress.  U.S. Const. art.I, [[section]]8 ("The Congressshall have Power to lay and collect Taxes.").  FDA has no authority, eitherunder the Constitution or the FDCA, to levy taxes or otherwise raise revenues.Accordingly, FDA's attempt to tax manufacturers based on the amount eachcompany spends on advertising is unconstitutional.  </tt><p><tt>	Congress has carefully regulated the fees and charges that FDA and otheragencies may impose.  To illustrate, Congress has provided that any feescharged by regulatory agencies must "be fair and equitable."  They must takeinto consideration "cost to the Government" and the "value to therecipient."  31 U.S.C. [[section]]483(a). In interpreting thisstatute, the Supreme Court has held that the imposition of a fee "connotes abenefit" to the one on whom the fee is imposed.  The Court further concludedthat any attempt to levy fees based on "public policy or interest served" isconstitutionally impermissible, as it would place an agency "far from itscustomary orbit" and into a revenue-seeking role "in the manner of anAppropriations Committee of the House."  See<i> </i>National CableTelevision Ass'n, Inc.v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 341(1974).   </tt><p><tt>	Even if, contrary to fact, the Agency had some colorable argument thatsome portion of the Agency's assessment is in the nature of a fee for benefits,such an argument would be legally insufficient to support this exaction.  TheSupreme Court has held that "Congress must indicate clearly its intention todelegate to the Executive the discretionary authority to recover administrativecosts not inuring directly to the benefit of regulated parties."Skinnerv. Mid America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 224(1989).  It is presumed that Congress did not intend to delegate such taxingauthority to the Executive Branch.  Therefore, courts require a cleardemonstration of congressional intent to authorize such taxation, and anagency's claim that it may impose such taxation is not entitled to deferenceunder Chevronv. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  SeeUnited Statesv. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., 2 F.3d 1265, 1274 n.14(3d Cir 1993).  Here, there is not the slightest indication of any suchcongressional intent.  </tt><p><tt>	Merely to state the program's purpose as described in Section 897.29(a)("to discourage persons under 18years of age from using cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco products") is to confirm that the exaction is unrelated toany "benefit" conferred on manufacturers by the Agency-- or to anystatutory violation purportedly committed by the manufacturers.  To thecontrary, FDA ties the imposition of the $150 million tax solely to its own"policy goals."  </tt><p><tt>	For example, FDA justifies its proposed regulation by citing societaltrends in per capita cigarette consumption, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,327, as well asresearch studies conducted in the United States and in other countriesregarding the supposed effects of counter-advertisingon youth smoking.  Id.  FDA even relies on the results of publiclyfunded antitobacco programs conducted by public health agencies.  FDA suggeststhat these agencies be consulted during the implementation of the proposedindustry-fundedprogram.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,327-28.  These facts demonstrate that FDA sees itsproposed manufacturer-funded program fulfilling the same functions as publiclyfunded antismoking campaigns.  None was funded from such private monies, muchless from coerced expenditures.</tt><p><tt>	Nor may FDA argue that a power to tax was somehow delegated to it byCongress.  There is no indication that Congress intended FDA to have broadtaxing power to implement its view of the public good.  Further, even if itcould be argued that Congress had delegated taxing authority to FDA, such adelegation would, itself, be unconstitutional.  See<i> </i>PanamaRef. Co.v. Ryan Amazon Petroleum Corp., 293 U.S. 388, 421(1935) ("The Congress manifestly is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer toothers the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested.").</tt><h4>(d)		Impermissible Appropriation--</h4><tt>			<b>ArticleI, [[section]] 9 (and 31 U.S.C. [[section]]3302)</b></tt><p><p><tt>	In addition to its other constitutional flaws, the provision wouldviolate the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, ArticleI,[[section]] 9, cl. 7, which provides:  "No money shall be drawn from theTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."  That clausedenies Executive Branch agencies the power to fund programs without acongressional appropriation.  Cincinnati Soap Co.v. UnitedStates, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937); Knotev. UnitedStates, 95 U.S. 149, 154 (1877); Brashearv. Mason, 47U.S. 92, 101 (1848).</tt><p><tt>	It is not within FDA's congressionally authorized power to command privatecompanies to pay money; but, even if it were, FDA still would be obliged todeposit such funds, unless Congress had otherwise provided, in the Treasury.See 31 U.S.C. [[section]] 3302(b); General Accounting Office,Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 1-3,6-106,6-107,6-112(2d ed. 1991).  Funds in the Treasury may not be withdrawn for any purposeexcept by act of Congress appropriating them.  Cincinnati Soap Co.,supra; see also<i> </i>OPMv. Richmond,496 U.S. 414 (1990); United Statesv. MacCollom, 426 U.S.317, 321 (1976).  This constitutional restriction on executive agencies assuresthat they do not conduct activities not authorized by their appropriations.Stith.  <i>Congress' Power of the Purse</i>. Yale L.J. 97:1343, 1356(1988).</tt><p><tt>	Section897.29, purporting to circumvent Congress by exacting fundsand then requiring their expenditure as directed by FDA, thus plainly violatesthe Appropriations Clause as well as 31 U.S.C.

As discussed below in SectionB, theparticular rules proposed in Subpart D are precluded by the ADAMHAReorganization Act of 1992 and the Federal Cigarette Labeling and AdvertisingAct ("FCLAA"), are contrary to law, violate the First Amendment, and sufferfrom other constitutional defects.</tt><p><p><tt><b>A.	Proposed Subpart D Exceeds FDA's Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	<b>Under theFDCA&nbs;</b></tt><p><p><tt><b>	1.	FDCA Sections 520(e) and 502 Do Not</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Authorize FDA's Proposed Advertising</b></tt><p><tt><b>Regulations&nbp;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDCA Section520(e)(1) provides that FDA "may by regulationrequire that a device be restricted to sale, distribution, or use" upon certainconditions.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360j(e)(1).  As detailed inVolumeV of these comments, the Act's language and legislative historydemonstrate that the authorized restrictions under subsection (e)(1) apply onlyto the physical articles of device, that is, to their sale (e.g.,upon prescription), their physical movement in distribution(e.g., shipment only to hospitals or clinics), and their use(e.g., by physicians or authorized health personnel).</tt><p><tt>	FDA nevertheless asserts that Section520(e) authorizes restrictionson a device's "offering for sale (including inducements to sale)," and tries tojustify its advertising and labeling restrictions on this basis.  60 Fed. Reg.41,350.  Congress, however, did not use the words "offer for sale" inSection520(e).  </tt><p><tt>	Neither the text nor the legislative history of Section520(e)mentions restrictions on labeling or advertising, but rather only those on thesale, distribution, or use of the physical article.  See[[section]]520(e); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1090, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 61-62(1976); H.R. Rep. No. 853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 24-25, 76 (1976).  Further,although Section520(e)(2) authorizes FDA to require certain statements onthe label of a restricted device, Section520(e) does not refer toeither the labeling or the advertising of a device.</tt>"fn0" [1  Accordingly, Section520(e) provides nolegal basis for regulations restricting the "offering for sale," labeling, oradvertising of a restricted device.<p>	FDCA Section502 does confer on FDA certain authority to regulate thelabeling and advertising of restricted devices, but that authority does notsupport FDA's proposals.  Section502(q)(1) simply prohibits "false ormisleading" advertising.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(q)(1).  It does notauthorize FDA to mandate or proscribe certain types of advertising or places ofadvertising, or to impose conditions for the purpose of making advertisingunattractive or ineffective.  In addition, it provides no authority to regulatelabeling.  <p>	Section502(q)(2) declares a device misbranded if it is sold,distributed, or used in violation of a ]<tt>valid regulation issuedunder Section520(e).  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(q)(2).Section502(q)(2) provides no independent authority to regulate labelingor advertising, and it cannot validate an attempted restriction that is notauthorized by Section520(e).  </tt><p><tt>	Section502(r) applies to advertising and other descriptive printedmatter, but it expressly does not apply to labeling.  21U.S.C.[[section]]352(r).  Section502(r) is limited in scope:  It only(1)requires advertising to include the device's established name;(2)requires advertising to include a brief statement of intended uses andrelevant warnings, precautions, side effects, and contraindications; and(3)authorizes FDA to require, where necessary to protect the publichealth, that advertising include a full description of the device's componentsor formula of ingredients.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(r).  Section 502(r)further provides that FDA cannot require prior approval of the content of anadvertisement except in "extraordinary circumstances."  Thus, Section 502(r)provides no authority for the restrictions FDA proposes in SubpartD ofthe regulations.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, since Congress in the FCLAA spoke with such particularity as tothe content of cigarette advertising and other descriptive printed matterrelating to cigarettes, and in the FDCA did not grant authority to FDA tospecify the content, place, or manner of advertising of any restricted device,Section502(r) cannot be interpreted as authorizing the cigaretteadvertising restrictions proposed by FDA.</tt><p><tt>	Section 201(n) of the FDCA authorizes FDA to consider whetherrepresentations made or suggested by statement, word, or design render aproduct's labeling or advertising misleading because of the failure to revealfacts material to such representations or to the consequences of the conditionsof use prescribed in the labeling or advertising.  21 U.S.C.[[section]]321(n).  Section201(n)-- which appears in thedefinitional section of the FDCA-- is not a separate grant of authority.It merely specifies the circumstances FDA may evaluate if a product is allegedto be misbranded.</tt><p><tt>	Section201(n) cannot be read to authorize FDA to prohibit entirelythe use of color, pictorial representations, or designs in product advertisingin the absence of evidence that they are inherently misleading.  Sections502(a) and 201(n) prohibit only advertising content or graphics that are falseor misleading.  Yet FDA's proposed regulations go far beyond this statutorylimitation on the Agency's authority even over products that, unlikecigarettes, are within its purview.  Advertising is not misleading simplybecause it is appealing; and being appealing does not constitute the omissionof a material fact.</tt>"fn2" [2<p>	In sum, device manufacturers can prepare and disseminate advertising and otherprinted matter with content, design, and imagery of their own choosing, limitedonly by the specific mandates or prohibitions of the FDCA.  None of thestatutory mandates or prohibitions support the kinds of advertisingrestrictions that FDA has proposed for cigarettes in this rule.]<p><tt><b>	2.	FDA Has Expanded the Scope of </b></tt><p><tt>		<b>"Labeling" Beyond Statutory Limits</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Under Section897.30(a)(2), FDA plans to regulate, on the pretextthat they are "labeling" under the FDCA, all "entries and teams in sponsoredevents" bearing "any . . . indicia of tobacco product identification."  Theproposal would thus reach those who may bear no more than a logo or symbol andwho provide no specific product information.  Section 897.30(a)(2) would applywhether or not any products were sold or distributed at the sponsored events.The preamble makes clear that FDA believes it has been given statutoryauthority to regulate, as "labeling," </tt><p><tt>"all commercial uses of the brand name of a product (alone or inconjunction with other words), logo, symbol, motto, selling message, or anyother indicia of product identification similar or identical to that used forany brand of cigarette."  60Fed. Reg. 41,334.  </tt><p><p><tt>	The Agency blurs the distinctions between advertising and "labeling," andbetween promotional material and "labeling"; and it would unlawfully regulateadvertisements and promotional materials as "labeling."  Labeling, advertising,and promotional material are not coextensive.  Only material that serves thefunction of labeling can be regulated as "labeling" under the FDCA:  </tt><p><tt>"Labeling does not include every writing which bears some relation to theproduct . . .  [The line] must be drawn in terms of the function served by thewriting."  United Statesv. 24 Bottles * * * Sterling Vinegarand Honey, 338 F.2d 157, 158-59 (2d Cir. 1964). </tt><p><p><tt>	Section201(m) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. [[section]]321(m),defines labeling as "all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter(1) upon any article . . . or (2) accompanying such article."  (Emphasisadded.)  The Supreme Court has held that, although an item need not physicallyaccompany a product to qualify as "labeling," there must be at least a "textualrelationship" to the product.  Kordelv. United States, 335U.S. 345, 350 (1948).  For such a "textual relationship" to exist, the materialmust be used in the sale of the product to "supplement" or "explain" theproduct "in the manner that a committee report of the Congress accompanies abill."   Id.  See also United Statesv.Urbuteit, 335 U.S. 355, 357 (1948) (holding that leaflets that did notphysically accompany devices were "labeling" where they "explained theusefulness of the device...").  The Court in Kordelheld that literature was "labeling" where it provided product information"constitut[ing] an essential supplement to the label attached to the package,"and was disseminated through the same commercial channel as the product.  335U.S. at 348.  See also United Statesv.Diapulse, 389 F.2d 612, 616 (2d Cir. 1968).</tt>"fn16" [3<p>	Thus, a mere brand name or logo, symbol or motto ]<tt>withoutexplanatory text does not constitute labeling.  As Section201(m) wasexplicated in Kordel, a product logo on a baseball cap is not"labeling," nor is a calling card that includes a brand name, nor is a race caror mug with a product symbol.  In these examples, the requisite "textualrelationship" is absent.  A logo or product name or symbol on a racing car orbaseball cap does not "explain" the use of a cigarette.  "Labeling" refers tomaterials that are "descriptive of" the product.  21C.F.R.[[section]]202.1(l)(2).  Brand logos, racing cars, and baseball caps donot describe the product or inform people how to use it.  Thus, they are not"labeling" under the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, like the product, labeling must be destined for thepurchaser's use.  To constitute "labeling," the item in question and theproduct must have "a common destination in that both [are] intended to cometogether. . . [as] interlocking units of a distributional scheme theobjective of which [is the] ultimate association and distribution together."United Statesv. 7 Jugs *** Dr.Salsbury'sRakos, 53 F. Supp. 746, 755 (D. Minn. 1944); United Statesv.Diapulse Mfg. Corp., 269 F. Supp. 162, 165 (D. Conn. 1967) ("the crucialfactor" is that the literature and product have "a common origin and commondestination" and are "interdependent"), aff'd, 389 F.2d 612 (2d Cir.1968).  See also United Statesv. ResearchLabs., 126 F.2d 42, 45 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 317U.S.656 (1942).</tt><p><tt>	For this independent reason, as well, racing cars, caps, tee shirts, mugs,and other items are not labeling:  They generally do not "accompany" cigarettesfrom manufacturer to smoker.  For example, racing cars and cigarettes do nothave a common origin; they generally do not travel together; and they do nothave a common destination.  Racing cars do not, in any sense of the wordrecognized in Kordel or in the jurisprudence of Section201(m),"accompany" cigarettes from the manufacturer to the smoker.  </tt><p><tt>	Advertisements may constitute labeling under the FDCA only when they havea "textual relationship" to the product itself and serve the purposes oflabeling, for potential or actual consumers of the product, by supplementing orexplaining information about the use of the product.  Information that merelyreminds the public generally of the product's existence is not"labeling."</tt>"fn18" [4  <p>]<p><tt><b>	B.

Reg. 41,356, 41,329), altering social"attitudes" towards smoking (id. at 41,315, 41,329), and delegitimizingand ultimately bringing about the demise of smoking as a social custom.  In sodoing, the regulations would impermissibly "reduce the adult population... to reading only what is fit for children."  Butler v.Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957).  For the reasons discussed ingreater detail in Volume IX of these comments, restricting or compelling speechby the cigarette manufacturers in the service of such objectives, and in such amanner, is impermissible under the First Amendment--wholly apartfrom the inability of the proposed regulations to pass muster under the testestablished by Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. PublicService Commission, 447 U.S. 557 (1980), for restrictions on commercialspeech.</tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>	3.

Fane, 113 S.Ct. 1792, 1798 (1993).  Inthe specific context of commercial speech, the Court has also stated that "thegovernment may not 'reduce the adult population... to readingonly what is fit for children.'"  Bolgerv. Youngs Drug Prods.Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983) (quoting Butlerv.Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957)).  The Court has squarely rejectedthe idea that the government has broader latitude under the First Amendment toregulate advertising for tobacco or alcoholic beverages than it has to regulateother commercial speech.  Rubinv. Coors Brewing Co., 115S.Ct. 1585, 1589-90 n.2 (1995).</tt><p><tt>	Under the First Amendment, commercial speech can be banned only ifit is "false, deceptive, or misleading."  Ibanezv. FloridaDep't of Business&amp; Professional Regulation, 114 S.Ct. 2084,2088 (1994).  Cigarette advertising, per se, is not "false,deceptive, or misleading," and therefore cannot be banned.  Commercial speechthat is not "false, deceptive, or misleading" may be restricted, "butonly if the State shows that the restriction directly and materially advances asubstantial state interest in a manner no more extensive than necessary toserve that interest."  Id.</tt><p><tt>	In Coors, the Court described this efficacy test as a "critical"requirement.  115 S.Ct. at 1592.  The government's burden is quitesubstantial:</tt><p><tt>"This burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, agovernmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech mustdemonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restrictionwill in fact alleviate them to a material degree."  Edenfield,113 S.Ct. at 1800 (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>	For the reasons discussed in this Volume, FDA has not demonstrated--and cannot demonstrate-- that its proposed restrictions on cigaretteadvertising, promotion and labeling "will in fact" reduce smoking among youngpeople "to a material degree."  Its restrictions also cannot be defended as a"narrowly tailored" means of discouraging smoking by young people.  Thereclearly are "less intrusive" alternatives to the severe restrictions onadvertising, promotion and labeling that FDA has proposed which would advanceFDA's goal without abridging First Amendment rights -- most notably,enforcement of the State-lawrestrictions on youth access that Congress sought to encourage in Section 1926of the Public Health Service Act, enacted as part of the ADAMHA ReorganizationAct of 1992.  See, e.g., Coors, 115 S.Ct. at1593; City of Cincinnativ. Discovery Network, Inc., 113S.Ct. 1505, 1510 n.13 (1993).  The Department of Health and HumanServices has stated that "eliminating virtually all sales [of tobacco products]to young people under youth access laws does not even present particularlydifficult enforcement problems."</tt>"fn20" [5  <p>	In ]<tt>Posadasv. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S.328 (1986), the Court, for a variety of reasons peculiar to that case, requiredcomparatively little from the government by way of justification in upholding aban on casino advertising directed at residents of Puerto Rico.  Subsequentdecisions such as Coors, Edenfield, and Ibanez, whichemphasize the heavy burden of justification borne by the government when itattempts to restrict commercial speech, confirm that Posadas wasaberrational in this regard, and is not good law beyond its specific facts.See also Florida Barv. Went For It, Inc., 115S.Ct. 2371 (1995); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.v.FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 129 (1989) ("Deference to a legislative findingcannot limit judicial inquiry when First Amendment rights are atstake.").</tt><p><tt>	As a general matter, under the Administrative Procedure Act courts do notdefer to agency actions when those actions are "contrary to constitutionalright, power, privilege or immunity."  5U.S.C. [[section]] 706(2)(B).When agency action threatens or impairs a constitutional right, a court willreview the agency's action de novo.  Western Energy Co.v.Dep't of Interior, 932 F.2d 807, 809 (9th Cir. 1991).</tt>"fn20" [6  In reviewing restrictions on commercialspeech, courts examine with special vigor, and show especially little deferenceto, the judgments of administrative bodies when First Amendment rights are atstake.  This vigor is consistently seen in Supreme Court decisions, whetherthey affirm or strike down the administrative restriction, and is also evidentin recent circuit court decisions.<p>	In ]<tt>Edenfield, for example, the Court invalidated a ban on in-personsolicitations imposed by the Florida Board of Accountancy.  The Court held theban unconstitutional because the agency did not offer any supporting studies orother evidence that the ban would advance the State's asserted interests.  113S. Ct. at 1800.  Indeed, the Court noted that the studies the agency offered infact contradicted the agency's position.  Id. at 1801.  In manyinstances that is true here as well.</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, in Florida Bar, the Supreme Court applied the CentralHudson test to regulations of direct-mailsolicitation imposed by the Florida bar.  Far from merely concluding that theban was "reasonable," the Court carefully reviewed the statistical andanecdotal evidence compiled by the State bar to justify the regulation.Florida Bar, 115 S. Ct. at 2377-78. Accord Ibanez, 114S. Ct. at 2091 (overturning reprimand ofattorney for false advertising where agency could not establish that restrictedspeech was misleading); Peelv. Attorney Registration &amp;Disciplinary Comm'n of Ill., 496 U.S. 91, 106-11 (1990) (same).</tt><p><tt>	Two recent cases in the Ninth Circuit have also applied the CentralHudson test rigorously when reviewing regulations by the Department ofAgriculture ("USDA") that impaired rights of commercial speech.  SeeWileman Bros. &amp; Elliott, Inc.v. Espy, 58 F.3d 1367 (9thCir. 1995); Cal-Almond,Inc.v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 14 F.3d 429 (9th Cir. 1993).  Inboth cases, growers and producers challenged USDA regulations that requiredthem to contribute money to generic advertising programs intended by the agencyto benefit them.  The growers and producers alleged that the program deprivedthem of advertising resources they could put to better use.  58 F.3d at 1377;14 F.3d at 438-39&amp; n.10.</tt><p><tt>	In Cal-Almond,the court noted that USDA had the burden of proving that its regulationsdirectly advanced the asserted interest of increasing consumption of almonds,and that deference was inappropriate.  14 F.3d at 437.  USDA relied on the court-approvedadage that advertising increases consumption.  While acknowledging the generalacceptance of this proposition, the court ruled against USDA because it did notoffer any evidence that its generic advertising program was more effective thanalternatives for increasing consumption.  Id. at 439.  The WilemanBros. court relied on Cal-Almond to arrive at the same result withrespect to USDA regulations regarding advertising of peaches and nectarines.58 F.3d at 1378-79.</tt><p><tt>	In all of the above cases, the courts appeared to engage in a morethorough analysis of the regulation than has sometimes been the case when alegislative enactment was under attack.  For this reason, FDA's proposedrestrictions on advertising and promotion are especially vulnerable toinvalidation under the First Amendment.  </tt><p><tt><b>		b.	The Supreme Court Has Rejected FDA's "Greater-Includes-the-Lesser"Rationale for SubpartD's Restrictions on CommercialSpeech</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA frames its justification for broad regulation of cigarette advertisingand promotion in the most sweeping terms:</tt><p><tt>"The agency believes that, because it could have banned the sale ordistribution of the product, or banned certain of the marketing and promotionalpractices of the tobacco industry, the lesser steps of regulating labeling andadvertising and requiring manufacturers to fund a government approvededucational campaign are reasonable."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,355.</tt><p><p><tt>	In support of this claim, FDA cites the following statement fromPosadas:</tt><p><tt>"[I]t is precisely because the government could have enacted awholesale prohibition of the underlying conduct that it is permissible for thegovernment to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct, butreducing the demand through restrictions on advertising."  Id. at 346(emphasis in original).  </tt><p><p><tt>	Such "greater power includes the lesser power" argument, moreover, cannotjustify these proposed regulations.</tt><p><tt>	First, this type of argument is contrary to established food anddrug law.  The fact that FDA could withdraw approval of methadone did not saveits ("lesser") regulation restricting the distribution of methadone.American Pharmaceutical Ass'nv. Mathews, 530 F.2d 1054(D.C. Cir. 1976), aff'g per curiam onopinion below, 377 F. Supp. 824, 830-31 (D.D.C. 1974).Similarly, from the fact that FDA can approve or refuse to approve anapplication for approval of OTC sale of a new drug, it does not follow that theAgency can regulate the advertising of the drug.  McNeilab, Inc.v.Heckler, Food &amp; Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH) [[paragraph]]38,317,at 39,788-89(D.D.C. 1985).  As a matter of construction of the FDCA, the fact that FDA hasa "greater" power with respect to a product does not entail that it also has a"lesser" power with respect to it.  FDA has only the powers delegated to it byCongress.</tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA's argument is constitutionally unsound.  Although theargument purports to justify speech restrictions and compelled speech, theargument is fundamentally at odds with the Central Hudson framework,within which commercial speech restrictions must be evaluated.	Although thefour-part Central Hudson test is recognized as the centerpiece ofcommercial speech analysis, FDA's crude greater-power/lesser-power rationalewould gut that test.  For if, as FDA would have it, any speechrestriction is permissible if the Agency could have banned the underlyingproduct, then there is simply no need to conduct steps (3) and (4) of theCentral Hudson analysis-- and step (2) may be dispensable as well.Under FDA's reasoning, everything is brutally simple:  The power to ban theproduct includes indiscriminate power to regulate commercial speech promotingthat product.  Any speech restriction (including an outright ban on alladvertising) would, by definition, be a "less intrusive step" than "enact[ing]a wholesale prohibition of the underlying conduct."  Posadas, 478 U.S.at 346.  Under FDA's analysis, there would be no need to examine the otherthree factors.  If FDA is correct that it has the lesser power to regulate asit sees fit, then Central Hudson's substantial-purpose,direct-advancement,and narrow-tailoringrequirements would disappear.  However, as the Supreme Court reaffirmed lastTerm in Rubinv. Coors Brewing Co., 115 S.Ct. 1585(1995), that simply is not the law.</tt><p><tt>	In Rubinv. Coors, the Court specifically rejected anargument very like the one proffered by FDA here.  In Rubin thegovernment, relying on Posadas, sought a more deferential standard ofreview for its statutory alcohol-labeling requirement.  The Court, however,rejected the argument that a less stringent test applies when the governmentseeks to discourage activities such as alcohol consumption.  Id. at1589-90 n.2.  Instead, the Court held that the four-pronged CentralHudson test remains the standard.  Id.  The Court dismissed a greater-power-includes-the-lesser-powerargument indistinguishable from the one on which FDA relies.  Id.

The argument's sweeping self-validationwould permit patently unfair and arbitrary discrimination by governmentregulation.  In the advertising context, the power to ban cigarettes altogetherpresumably would include the lesser power to regulate advertising by forbiddingall cigarette companies but one to advertise.  This kind of regulatorydiscrimination cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.  If the governmentallows a type of expression generally, the First and Fifth Amendments placelimits on government regulation of subsets of that expression.  It is no wonderthat the Supreme Court, itself, in a case decided two years afterPosadas, described the greater-power-includes-the-lesserargument as "discredited."  See City of Lakewoodv.

No empiricalresearch has been able to show that aggregate brand advertising leads togreater total tobacco consumption.  Nor has anything been found to suggest thatadvertising entices nonsmokers, young people in particular, into becomingsmokers.  It follows, therefore, that there can be no evidence showing that aban on advertising would result in reduced tobacco consumption and fewer newsmokers."</tt>"fn29" [8<p><p>	At the same conference, Professor James L. Hamilton of Wayne State Universitystated that advertising bans "have not been an effective policy for reducingcigarette smoking."9  Dr.Hamilton explained that cigarette advertising is"a competitive weapon" and "has not been used as a means for expanding [the]market."10<p>	In the 20 years since, this view that advertising does not prompt new, and "inparticular" young, consumers to smoke has been studied and confirmed time andagain.  For example, The Ontario Task Force on Smoking acknowledged in 1982that "[n]o persuasive empirical evidence exists" to support the contention thatadvertising is a significant determinant of smoking.11  <p>	Michael Pertschuk, the former Chairman of the FTC who now helps direct theAdvocacy Institute--an antismoking lobbying group-- and who urgedPresident Clinton to approve action by FDA to restrict cigarette advertising,12stated in 1983 that "[n]o one really pretends that advertising isa...major determinant of smoking in this country or anyother."13<p>	Elizabeth Whelan of the American Council on Science and Health stated in 1985that an advertising ban would "probably not" reduce cigarette consumption inthe United States.14<p>	In 1989, then-U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, M.D., acknowledged thatcigarette advertising and promotion have not been shown to increase the levelof tobacco consumption.  As he stated:<p>"There is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public thatprovides a definitive answer to the basic question of whether advertising andpromotion increase the level of tobacco consumption."15<p><p>	In 1990, the Legislative Council of the Western Australian Parliament,although stating that advertising "might" influence some young people, concededthat ]<tt>evidence of such an effect was absent:</tt><p><tt>"After receiving evidence from people eminent in relevant fields ofresearch, the Committee is forced to the conclusion that no compelling evidencehas been presented that advertising causes people, and in particular youngpeople, to begin smoking."</tt>"fn37" [16<p>]<p><tt><b>			(2)	Acknowledgments by Government Officials,</b></tt><p><tt><b>				University Researchers, and Antismoking</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Advocates That Family and Peer Influences</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Are the Major Determinants of Youth Smoking</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Government researchers in the United States and many othercountries have likewise recognized that family and friends are the primaryinfluences on smoking by young people.  Advertising has not been found to havea major role.  Many studies confirm that adolescents' smoking behavior isprincipally influenced by family members and peers.</tt>"fn38" [17<p>	In 1969, data gathered for the American Cancer Society demonstrated that"[p]ersons in the environment are clearly very important in shaping smokingbehavior:  Where parents or other frequently seen adults smoke, youngsters aremore likely to take up the habit. ...  Most influential of all seemto be friends."18<p>	In 1983, Dr.Mortimer Lipsett, the Director of the U.S. NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development, testified that "[t]he mostforceful determinants of smoking [by young people] are parents, peers, andolder siblings."19  Dr.Lipsett also noted:  <p>"If one parent smokes, the child is ]<tt>twice as likely to smoke asone reared in a nonsmoking household.  If both parents or one parent and anolder sibling smoke, the chances become four to one.  If the child'sbest friend smokes, there is a 90 percent probability that the childwill smoke too."</tt>"fn40" [20<p><p>	Researchers looking at the long-term correlation of factors provide furthersupport for the thesis that peers are the most dominant influence in youthsmoking.21  These findings are not limited to the United States, butreflecta worldwide phenomenon.<p>	Monique B&eacute;gin, then Canada's Minister of National Health and Welfare,stressed in a 1983 address that "[t]he people who most influence a child tostart smoking are his or her friends and family."22  In Canada, a 1987 studyfound that peer influences on smoking increase during adolescence whereasparental influences remain constant.  The number of smoking friends and thepercentage of older siblings who smoked were found to be "'consistent andpowerful' predictors of future smoking," with respect to both initialexperimentation and the transition to becoming a regular smoker.23Dr.M.J. Ashley of the University of Toronto similarly reported in 1983that Canadian boys and girls whose fathers or mothers smoke are significantlymore likely to smoke than Canadian boys and girls whose fathers and mothers donot.24<p>	A 1991 study of 11-to 15-year-oldsin European Community member nations found consistent influences toward smokingacross cultures.25  Peer group environment was the most significant factor inthe decision to smoke, followed by family environment, interaction withfriends, schooling, and a host of other factors.  Advertising was reported toplay a role in only one-thirdof the countries studied, and the reported influence of advertising was foundto be far below that of factors such as peer and family influence.26<p>	Studies conducted in 1975 and 1980 in Norway showed that where both parentssmoked, and they permitted their children to smoke, about 67 percent of the15-year-old boys and 78percent of the girls were daily smokers.  Whereneither parent smoked, and the children were not permitted to smoke, thefigures fell to 9 percent for boys and 11 percent for girls.27<p>	Studies reported in the ]<tt>British Journal of Addiction in 1991and 1992 likewise emphasize the key role of parents and family development injuvenile smoking decisions.</tt>"fn54" [28  Thesestudies found that nonsmokers with siblings who smoked were much more likely tostart smoking than were those with nonsmoking siblings.  Advertising, bycontrast, is not mentioned as a significant factor in either the initiation orthe maintenance of juvenile smoking.<p>	A 1988 study of Japanese youth showed that an individual's smoking behaviorwas "most strongly related" to peer smoking behavior, and that parental andsibling smoking, educational aspiration and attitude toward prohibitions onyouth smoking also were significantly related to smoking behavior.29<p>	A 1995 study by Fergusson, et al.,30 analyzed the correlation between earlysmoking experimentation and smoking at age 16 years, among a group of 735 urbanNew Zealand children who had been tracked from birth.  The authors concludedthat peer groups were the primary pathway linking early smoking experimentationto later smoking.  The evidence gathered suggested that children who engaged inearly smoking experimentation tended to affiliate with adolescent peer groupswhose members smoked.  In turn, these peer group affiliations reinforcedpreexisting tendencies to cigarette smoking. <p>	A 1990 study for the government of Hong Kong similarly found that theprevalence of youth smoking "is significantly related to family smokinghabits."  The author noted that smoking mothers and sisters are particularlysignificant factors "in eastern society where parental supervision is very muchexercised by female members of the family."31<p>	The World Helath Organization's ("WHO") regional director for Europe likewisehas reiterated that "smoking among children and adolescents is heavily linkedto the smoking behavior of parents."32<p>	A 1992 report by the U.K. Department of Health stated that, although somesurveys suggest that awareness and approval of cigarette advertising isassociated with youth smoking, "other factors such as the smoking behavior ofparents and siblings are more important, and it is possible that those childrenwho react most positively to advertising are already disposed to smoke."33<p>	A further report by the U.K. Department of Health on smoking prevalence amongadolescents in the United Kingdom (England, Wales, and Scotland) found thatsiblings' smoking behavior was even more influential on adolescents than thesmoking habits of their parents.34  Conversely, the survey found, havingnonsmoking siblings at home appeared to influence adolescents]<tt>not to smoke.  In addition, the survey found that 75 percent ofadolescents who were regular smokers said that all or most of their friendssmoked.</tt><p><tt>	In 1993, a team of U.S. researchers noted their finding that formersmoking and current smoking by parents are important indicators of adolescenttobacco use.  The researchers stated that "the results of this studydemonstrate, once again, the strength of the link between parents' and theiradolescents' smoking."</tt>"fn66" [35<p>	British researchers examining the attitudes of very young children and thesmoking behavior of their parents concluded that "[w]hat has unquestionablyemerged from this research is that children as young as three ARE STRONGLYINFLUENCED by the role model of adult smoking; daily contact with a parent whosmokes is consistent with a child having positive attitudes towardssmoking."36<p>	A study of South Korean youth determined that "[p]erceived peer use was thestrongest predictor of cigarette smoking for boys and girls."37<p>	A 1994 study of adolescent smoking in Australia determined that the "primarymotivation to take up smoking and to keep smoking through the school years, isprimarily ]<tt>social definition - peer identity ('where Ifit in'), self image ('who I am') and acquiring power('defiance/rebellion')."</tt>"fn69" [38<p>	Reviewing a recent survey of youth and parental smoking behavior in LosAngeles, one researcher found it "surprising that national health lobbies andofficials recently downplayed parental smoking as a promoter of youth smoking"and instead have emphasized influences external to the home.39  The 1995 LosAngeles survey found that 60percent of youth who smoked "came from theminority of the households which contained a smoking parent."40  In contrast,given the universal exposure of youth to tobacco advertising, "[i]t is unlikely... that this factor would explain much, if any, of the variance inyouth smoking unexplained by parental smoking."41  The researcher concludedthat "[t]he increasing politicization of national health policies should notmislead health educators [with respect] to the reality that the biggestinfluences on, and most accurate predictors of, youth behavior, includingsmoking, remain the behavior of parents and other adults around them."42<p>	Another recent study examined the influence of more general parentalpractices, in addition to parental smoking behavior, and found that youngpeople are more likely to smoke when parental monitoring is inadequate.43  Suchinadequate monitoring often results from family conflict and lack of parentalinvolvement.<p>	Children, themselves, report that peer pressure and parents' smoking are theprincipal factors influencing them to smoke.  The vast majority of high schoolstudents responding to a survey in Florida stated that peer pressure, notadvertising, was the most important factor influencing students' smoking.44<p>	Researchers examining influences on American adolescent smoking behavior atspecific age levels concluded that "[t]he smoking behavior of best friendsturned out to be the strongest social environmental risk factor for both maleand female adolescent smoking throughout the 14-to 18-year-oldage levels."45<p>	The results of the teenage focus groups conducted for FDA in connection withits consideration of an additional health warning for cigarette advertising areconsistent with this research.  Peer pressure headed the list of reasons forstarting to smoke given by the teenage participants, according to FDA and MacroInternational.  60 Fed. Reg. 61,670, 61,673 (Dec.1, 1995).  This isconfirmed by a review of the transcripts of the focus groups provided byFDA.46<p>	In addition, underage smoking has been identified as one symptom of moregeneral risk-takingbehavior.47  As a 1993 study in the ]<tt>Journal of School Healthnoted:</tt><p><tt>	"Some studies suggest cigarette-smoking youth may be more likely to takerisks of all types....  One study linked cigarettesmoking with early age of sexual intercourse and with failure to make timelyuse of contraceptives, supporting the risk-takinghypothesis."</tt>"fn96" [48<p><p>	According to research conducted in 1989 by the National Center for HealthStatistics:  "[C]ompared with other teenagers, proportionately about twice asmany youths who smoked had been in fights, had ridden a motorcycle or minibike,or enjoyed risky activities now and then."49 ]<p><tt><b>			(3)  WHO Cross-Country Research</b></tt><p><tt>	The decisive influence of family and peers on youth smoking is supportedby a four-country survey conducted in 1983-1984by WHO, the results of which were published in 1986:</tt><p><tt>"When young people start smoking, the most important predictor is thesmoking behavior and smoking-related activities of 'significantothers'."</tt>"fn102" [50<p><p>	The WHO survey concluded that "[t]he strongest statistical relationships arefound with the smoking habits of the best friend."51  The survey also foundthat smoking among schoolchildren is "strongly related to the number of smokersin the family."52  The researchers found "]<tt>no systematicdifferences" between the smoking behavior of young people in countrieswhere tobacco advertising is completely banned and in countries where it isnot.</tt>"fn108" [53<p>	In an update focusing on the prevalence of youth smoking among schoolchildrenin 1986-1987, Aar&oslash; and two colleagues reaffirmed the results of theearlier study.54  They found, in general, that the countries with the highestincidence of youth smoking are those in which tobacco advertising is banned,whereas the countries with the lowest incidence of youth smoking are those inwhich some tobacco advertising is permitted.<p>	In both Finland and Norway, tobacco advertising had been banned for more thana decade at the time of the study.

The Hong Kong study confirmedthat parents and peer group are the most significant influences on youthsmoking.58<p>	In Singapore, where tobacco product advertising has been banned since 1970,the Health Ministry claimed that smoking among 15-to 19-year-oldboys jumped from 5.5 percent in 1987 to 12.3 percent in 1991, and that smokingamong 15-to 19-year-oldgirls increased during the same period from 0.1 percent to 0.7percent.59]<p><tt><b>			(4)  The Scandinavian Experience</b></tt><p><tt><b>				(a)  Finland</b></tt><p><tt>	In Finland, tobacco product advertising has been banned completelysince 1978.

According to their own smaller study,G&ouml;testam and G&ouml;testam reported that 43percent of adultNorwegians were daily smokers in 1979, and 48percent were daily smokersin 1989.

Howard Beales III, Associate Professor for StrategicManagement and Public Policy at George Washington University, conducted a majoranalysis of the determinants of teen smoking.</tt>"fn133" [73  Professor Beales used ordered logisticregression analyses to examine two sets of government data:  a 1990 survey of5040 teens, age 12-17, conducted for the California Department of Health, andthe 1989 national Teenage Attitudes and Practice Survey (TAPS I), conducted forthe Centers for Disease Control, using data from 9,965 teens, age 11-19.  Afteranalyzing the substantial body of data on teen smoking habits, attitudes, andbehavior in TAPS I, Professor Beales concluded:<p>"The most important variables determining teenage smoking behavior are thosereflecting the behavior of peers.  Teens are more likely to smoke if most oftheir acquaintances smoke, and more likely to smoke the more of their bestfriends smoke."74<p><p>	Professor Beales also measured the effect of advertising expenditures--both total industry advertising expenditures and advertising expenditures forthe most popular brands-- on teen smoking behavior.  He concluded:<p>"The data are consistent with the hypothesis that advertising expenditures haveno influence on teenage decisions about smoking.  They cannot, of course, provethat hypothesis.  Certainly, however, the data provide no evidence to supportthe notion that advertising has an important or powerful effect on teenagers'decisions."75<p><p>	Finally, Professor Beales analyzed whether advertising affects teens'perceptions of the benefits of smoking and thus might have an indirect effecton teenage smoking decisions.  Again, his analysis found no appreciableeffect.76  Professor Beales' study is the best available evidence of therelationship between advertising and teenage smoking decisions.  ProfessorBeales recently confirmed his original analysis using the 1993 TAPS data (TAPSII).77  <p>	Also instructive is the testimony in 1986 before the House Subcommittee onHealth and the Environment by Dr.Roger D. Blackwell, Professor ofMarketing at Ohio State University, and Dr.Scott Ward, Professor ofMarketing at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.78Dr.Blackwell explained:<p>"From his parents a child acquires basic attitudes toward smoking.  The morethe parents smoke, the more likely the child will smoke; the more the parentsdiscourage smoking the less likely the child will smoke.<p><p>"Friends also play a significant role in the youngster's decision to trysmoking and become a smoker.  And so does the image of 'the smoker' that mostchildren develop.  Children report a distinct image of the stereotypicalsmoker, and it is not the flattering image that anti-tobacco advocatesattribute to cigarette advertising.<p><p>"The stereotypical smoker is viewed by children as less educationallysuccessful, less healthy, and 'tougher' than the stereotypicalnonsmoker-- and nonsmokers generally view other nonsmokers as moredesirable to have as friends than smokers.<p><p>"None of the research suggests that advertising influences children to viewsmoking in a positive light-- we are talking about not intent but actualresponse among the children.  To the contrary, the research that is availablerevealed in young people a skepticism and distaste for cigaretteadvertising."79  <p><p>	Dr.Blackwell's observations on children's skepticism are alsocorroborated by other findings on how children view television commercials forall kinds of products-- and television has been characterized as themedium having the greatest influence with young people.80<p>	These conclusions coincide with those of a 16-country study by the Children'sResearch Unit (CRU) of London, ]<tt>Juvenile Smoking Initiation &amp;Advertising (March 1989).</tt>"fn146" [81  Inall countries surveyed, the chances of a child smoking were low in a householdwhere there were no other smokers.82  <p>	Studies indicating that young smokers may "like" cigarette advertisements donot imply any "cause and effect" relationship between cigarette advertising andsmoking.83  At most, they merely confirm that those who smoke are more likelyto pay attention to ads and hold positive attitudes or brand preferences thanthose who do not.84  <p>	A survey by RBL Research International points out that children have highlevels of awareness even of products in which they have no consumerinterest-- and that this does not establish that an advertising messagehas been accepted by them:  "[A]dvertising recall and popularity cannot betaken by themselves as evidence of advertising effectiveness or ofunintentional advertising influence."85  Indeed, RBL found that those childrenwho had higher recognition of cigarette advertisements were ]<tt>notmore likely to have tried smoking.</tt>"fn163" [86RBL also found it probable that the main determinants of smoking behavior aresituational and social factors rather than advertising.87<p>	A recent study of U.S. children age three to eight found that althoughawareness of advertising symbols such as "Joe Camel" was high, such recognitiondid not translate into a positive attitude towards smoking.88  This study foundthat, regardless of recognition of Joe Camel, 96percent of the childrensurveyed disliked cigarettes, 97percent reported that cigarettes are "badfor you," and ]<tt>zero percent of the children identifiedcigarettes as appropriate for children.  The author concluded:</tt><p><tt>"To equate high awareness with positive attitudes or the intent to consumethe product . . . is to make a giant leap of logic and to grossly underestimatethe abilities of young children to think critically, engage inperspective-taking, and make value judgments."</tt>"fn166" [89<p><p>	Other recent studies also show that young people with high recognition ofcigarette advertising actually dislike smoking.90  In a study of the effects ofcartoon trade characters on product recognition and attitude among children,Richard Mizerski refutes the contention that high levels of characterrecognition translate into positive attitude toward a product.  The studyinvolved a review of the attitudes of children age three to six with regard totrade characters such as Joe Camel, Tony the Tiger, and Charley the Tuna.91<p>	High levels of product and trade character recognition were found, includingthe association of Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man with cigarettes.  Moreover,the recognition of selected trade characters tended to increase with the age ofthe child.  The level of recognition and favorable attitude toward the productwere positively associated with age, except for cigarettes and matches.  Theattitudes toward cigarettes and matches were negatively associated with age.<p>	Furthermore, on the basis of the data, the author posits that:<p>"it is possible that frequent exposure to cigarettes in this negative contextcould prompt negative effect toward that product.  This could happen with orwithout trade character use and its high recognition; and high recognition of atrade character could intensify the negative effect."92<p><p>	Thus, contrary to FDA's position, high rates of character recognition do nottranslate into strong favorable attitudes toward cigarettes.]<p><tt><b>		b.	The Evidence Cited by FDA Does Not Support</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>the Proposed Advertising Restrictions </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	To support its proposed regulations -- and without taking account of theforegoing evidence -- FDA cites numerous studies regarding the purportedinfluence of cigarette advertising on smoking by young people.  Relying on the1994 Surgeon General's Report, the Institute of Medicine report, and othersources, FDA contends that young people's awareness about, recognition of, andattitudes toward cigarette advertising play a significant "contributory role"in smoking initiation and usage patterns.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.</tt><p><tt>	The body of "evidence" on which FDA relies, however, simply does notestablish that these factors play any significant role in youth smokingdecisions.  The studies, many of which are fraught with serious methodologicalshortcomings, do not provide the "missing link" between (1)measures ofperception of advertising and (2)the decision to smoke.  In fact, much ofFDA's purported evidence actually contradicts such a causal connection.</tt><p><tt>	FDA builds its case on studies reporting (1)that young people areaware of cigarette advertising, brands, and logos; (2)that adolescentsmokers tend to be more adept than adolescent nonsmokers at recalling andrecognizing cigarette advertisements and slogans in which product and brandinformation has been removed; (3)that teen smokers report higher rates ofexposure to cigarette ads than teens who do not smoke; (4)that adolescentsmokers are more likely than adolescent nonsmokers to "like" cigaretteadvertisements; (5)that children who eventually declare an intention tosmoke are more aware of cigarette advertisements than are other children, andhave more favorable attitudes towards cigarette advertisements than do otherchildren, even before they declare such an intention; (6)that adolescentsmokers tend to overestimate smoking prevalence at higher rates than doadolescent nonsmokers; (7)that greater exposure to cigarette advertisingcorrelates positively with smoking overestimation; and (8)that teens tendto prefer the most heavily advertised cigarette brands.</tt><p><tt>	Each of these conclusions is based upon some correlation among measuredvariables.  However, none establishes (or logically implies) thatadvertising causes young people to begin to smoke -- the point criticalto FDA's case.  Each of the studies cited by FDA scores "zero" in this regard,and even though FDA may cite 50 such studies, as though to suggest a mountainof evidence in support of its conclusions, 50 times "zero" is still "zero."FDA's conclusions about advertising and smoking by young people rest entirelyon a tangle of non sequiturs.</tt><p><tt>	Adolescents as a whole may well be "aware" of cigarette advertising, butsmokers appear to be no more and no less "aware" of such advertising than dononsmokers.  Teen smokers may be better at recognizing and recalling cigaretteadvertisements and slogans with missing information than their nonsmokingpeers, but there is no reason to infer from this that advertising influencedtheir decision to smoke.  It is at least as likely, and probably more so, thatteens who smoke began paying greater attention to cigarette advertising onlyafter initiating smoking or becoming interested in starting.  As with adultsmokers, other factors, such as peer and family smoking, can also lead youthsand adolescents to be more aware of and regard tobacco advertising favorably.Thus, mere correlations among smoking behavior and advertising exposure,recall, recognition, and attitudes are readily explained by otherconsiderations.</tt><p><tt>	Overestimation of smoking prevalence also says nothing about causation.Even if advertising caused teens to overestimate smoking prevalence, it cannotbe said to explain decisions to smoke.  Finally, the fact that teens purchaseheavily advertised brands says nothing about their decisions to smoke in thefirst place.  Teens who smoke can be expected to use cigarette advertising justas adults do, to obtain brand-distinguishinginformation.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's theory of causation hinges upon the "compelling evidence" supposedlydelivered by the entire "body" of scientific literature.  The cited studies,however, are replete with acknowledgments from the authors that their researchdoes not establish a causal relationship.  None of these studiesestablishes causation.  Reliance upon these studies as a group provides no moreevidence of causation than reliance upon each one individually.  Even the IOMand Surgeon General's Reports admit their inability to establishcausation.</tt><p><tt><b>			(1)  IOM Report</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA relies heavily on the IOM Report to support its argument thatcigarette advertising causes young people to begin smoking.  See,e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  The IOM Report, however, and thestudies upon which it and FDA rely, admit that they are unable toestablish causality.  IOM acknowledges that present scientific and statisticalmethods do not establish a causal relationship between advertising and smokingbehavior.  Even weak surrogates for causality, e.g.,"predisposition" or "favorable conditioning," are not established by thematerials FDA relies on.</tt><p><tt><b>				(a)	The IOM Report Acknowledges the Lack</b></tt><p><tt><b>					of Evidence of a Causal Relationship</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Between Advertising and Smoking     </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	IOM and FDA rely on studies of advertising recall, advertisingrecognition, and self-reported advertising exposure to support their assertionsthat cigarette advertising influences adolescents.</tt>"fn174" [93  According to IOM, this body of researchshows that "young people who maintain an interest in smoking retain moreinformation from cigarette ads."94  Even IOM, however, does not contend thatattention to advertising causes young people to begin smoking.  Indeed, IOMnotes that "[c]hoices to smoke are often spontaneous and based on psychologicaland social processes of identification, individuation, and differentiation.The effect of advertising is complex, and measuring the relative magnitude ofany one type of influence on human behavior in isolation from other influencesis difficult."95<p>	Indeed, the IOM recognizes that the research it cites does ]<tt>notshow that advertising in any way causes smoking behavior.  IOM reports that itsconclusion that young people interested in smoking retain more information fromcigarette ads "has been used to imply that there is a causal link betweenconsumption and exposure to advertising, as well as between recognition of adsand smoking behavior."</tt>"fn180" [96  Accordingto IOM, however, "[t]his leap in the interpretation of the data isquestionable."97  IOM explains that it "is not known at present ...whether youths already interested in smoking become more attentive toadvertisements or whether advertisements lead youths to become more interestedin smoking."98  ]<tt>See also pp. 123-124 (discussingpossibility that smokers are more attentive to cigarette advertising than arenonsmokers).

Many econometric studies address thepurported relationship between cigarette advertising prevalence and consumptionpatterns.  Such studies generally compare advertising expenditures (a proxy foradvertising prevalence) to aggregate consumption data.  IOM acknowledges thatsuch studies are imprecise and therefore of limited utility:</tt><p><tt>"It is unrealistic to expect that studies correlating trends in tobaccoconsumption with aggregate expenditures on advertising can provide meaningfulinsight about the influence of advertising on tobacco use by children andyouths.

Tye, on whose research the IOMand FDA rely.100  Tye reviews and critiques numerous econometric studies of therelationship between advertising and cigarette consumption.  Tye's conclusionon the utility of econometric analysis is similar to IOM's:<p>"There are problems with using...[econometric] studiesto predict the impact of a total elimination of advertising and promotion."101<p><p>Econometric techniques are used to estimate the impact of marginal incrementsof advertising expenditures on incremental demand.  As Tye noted, this led Cox(another researcher) to conclude that they are "irrelevant for the purpose ofevaluating the effect of comprehensive legislative controls on advertising andpromotion."102<p>	Thus, by IOM's own admission, the utility of using econometric analysis tolink advertising to consumption patterns is limited.  The specific economicstudies FDA relies on are discussed below.103]<p><tt><b>				(c)	FDA Misstates IOM's Conclusion</b></tt><p><tt><b>					Regarding Evidence of a Causal</b></tt><p><tt><b>					Relationship Between Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>and Smoking Initiation          </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA cites the IOM Report for the proposition that "there is sufficientevidence to conclude that advertising and labeling play a significant andimportant contributory role in a young person's decision to use cigarettes."60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  This statement mischaracterizes IOM's conclusion.</tt><p><tt>	Contrary to FDA's suggestion, IOM does not reach a scientific conclusionthat there is substantial evidence that advertising actually influences youngpeople to begin smoking.  Rather, IOM makes a policy judgment that, in order towarrant advertising restrictions, it is not necessary to presentdefinitive evidence of an actual cause-and-effectrelationship.</tt>"fn188" [104  IOM suggests,instead, that, it is necessary to show only that features of advertising"]<tt>have the natural tendency to encourage" youths tosmoke.</tt>"fn188" [105  This assertion reflectsIOM's public policy view that, rather than target known causes of smoking, itis legitimate to target factors that, regardless of their actual impact, lendthemselves more readily to regulatory supervision.<p>	Moreover, IOM's weak conclusion that cigarette advertising "tends" toencourage young people to begin smoking is wholly suppositional, assuming itsown conclusion.  IOM presents mere theories regarding the messages conveyed bycigarette advertising, and it acknowledges that insufficient evidence existsregarding actual perceptions, interpretations, and use of these messages andimagery in cigarette advertisements.106  ]<p><tt><b>			(2)  The 1994 Surgeon General's Report</b></tt><p><tt>	Citing the 1994 Surgeon General's Report,</tt>"fn192" [107 FDA asserts that "studies offer acompelling argument for the mediated relationship of cigarette advertising andadolescent smoking."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  The Surgeon General's Report,however, rested that conclusion on studies that were not capable of determiningwhether advertising causes children (or anyone else) to begin smoking.  Betterdesigned research, such as that of Professor Beales, shows that the criticalinfluences on youth smoking decisions are the behavior of peers and familymembers and young people's perceptions of the costs and benefits ofsmoking.108<p>	The Surgeon General's Report, as well as the studies upon which it and FDArely, admit that they do not address causation of actual smoking.  The SurgeonGeneral clearly was aware that existing research does not demonstrate thepurported causal relationship between advertising and smoking initiation.Indeed, the report acknowledges that "no longitudinal study of the directrelationship of cigarette advertising to smoking initiation has been reportedin the literature."109<p>	Like the IOM, the Surgeon General and FDA rely on studies of advertisingrecall, advertising recognition, and self-reported advertising exposure tosupport their assertion of a "mediated" relationship between cigaretteadvertising and adolescent smoking.110  The Surgeon General's Reportcharacterizes this same research as showing that "young people are aware of,and respond to, cigarette advertising."111  <p>	Although the studies arguably indicate that young people are]<tt>aware of advertising for tobacco products, they do not showthat young people "respond" to those advertisements beyond being able torecall brand names and advertising slogans.  This kind of "response" isnot sufficient to support FDA's proposed restrictions on cigarette advertising,promotion and labeling.  Consciousness of cigarette advertising itself cannotbe considered "harmful."  In none of the studies cited by the SurgeonGeneral is there any actual indication that advertising influences young peopleto smoke.  None of the studies shows, and none is designed to enable one toinfer, a causal relationship between advertising and the initiation of smoking.</tt><p><tt><b>			(3)	The Studies Cited by FDA on</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Advertising Recall, Approval, and</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Young People's Response to Cigarette</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Ads Do Not Demonstrate Causation    </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA claims:  "Many studies have shown that young people are aware of,respond favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising."</tt>"fn203" [112  This is an artfully crafted, butfundamentally misleading, statement.  It insinuates, but stops short ofasserting, that cigarette advertising influences young people to smoke.  <p>	Being "aware" of advertising (in the sense of being conscious of it), having a"favorable response" to advertising (in the sense of liking the advertising),and being "influenced by" advertising (in the sense of having]<tt>some reaction to it) are not remotely the same as beinginfluenced by cigarette advertising to smoke.  Indeed, all of these supposed"effects" of advertising can occur without any smoking at all.  FDA's failureto disclose the limits of the studies' actual findings -- and, in particular,the studies' uniform failure to demonstrate that advertising causes anyone tosmoke -- is an omission that makes FDA's entire discussion misleading.</tt><p><tt>	FDA cites in support of its conclusion of causality the IOM Report, the1994 Surgeon General's Report, and studies by Pierce and Tye.</tt>"fn203" [113  Misleadingly, the Agency lumps togetherthe distinct concepts of advertising "awareness," "favorable response," and"influence."114  The Agency fails to identify the studies that ostensiblysupport the assertion of "influence," the only component of FDA's statementthat even arguably can be tied to causation of smoking.  ]<tt>Noneof the studies cited by FDA establishes that cigarette advertising "influences"youths to begin smoking.</tt>"fn205" [115]First, as noted, the IOM Report does not indicate that youthare influenced by cigarette advertising.  What the IOM actually says isthat "[s]everal studies have shown a positive correlation between adolescents'ability to recall a particular advertisement, logo, or brand insignia andsmoking intent, initiation, or level of smoking."</tt>"fn205" [116  This statement does not indicate whichway the causal arrow points.<p>	Moreover, the studies IOM cites in support of its statement117 themselves failto provide evidence to support FDA's position.  The Aitken study says nothingabout advertising's influence on youth.118  The Goldstein study measures onlythe possible impact of smoking behavior on advertising recognition, and doesnot mention the subject of advertising's influence on youth smoking.  The 1994Pierce Study of the California Tobacco Control Program shows, at most, thatyoung people are ]<tt>aware of cigarette advertising; and the 1991Pierce Study attempts-- in an intellectual sleight of hand-- toequate advertising recall with appeal or effectiveness.  Even ifPierce's faulty equation were correct, an advertisement's "appeal" or"effectiveness" is still entirely distinct from causation of actualsmoking.</tt><p><tt>	Second, as noted above, the Surgeon General's Report, like the IOMReport, does not indicate that young people are influenced by cigaretteadvertising.  The Surgeon General's Report assembles and summarizes numerousother studies on the following topics: young people's "exposure" toadvertising, their "opinions" on cigarette advertising and smoking behaviors;their "responses" to different types of cigarette advertisements</tt>"fn209" [119; "humor" in advertising; their"responses" to some specific advertising campaigns; and their "self-image" andits "implications" for tobacco use.  Noticeably absent from this long list isany supposed causation by cigarette advertising of smoking by young people.]Third, the Tye article</tt>"fn211" [120 is less a "study" than a review ofexisting research and commentary.  With regard to any effect of cigaretteadvertising on adolescents' decisions to smoke, Tye, unlike the studies citedby FDA, actually describes the manner in which cigarette advertising supposedlyinfluences adolescents:  <p>"Many of the lifestyles glamorized in cigarette advertising today, likemotorcycle and automobile racing, surfers and beach parties, hang-gliders andmountain-climbers, are those most aspired to by adolescents.  According toadvertising industry critic William Myers, cigarette marketers 'prey on theinsecurity' of adolescents by targeting them with smoking role models."121<p><p>Tye's explanation for adolescents' smoking behavior is purely speculative.  Heprovides no empirical evidence to support his assumptions regardingadolescents' perceptions of, and reliance on, cigarette advertising.  Rather,he merely assumes that adolescents interpret cigarette advertisements like the"advertising industry critic" whom the study quotes.<p>	Finally, FDA cites Pierce's 1994 study of the California Tobacco ControlProgram in support of its proposition that cigarette advertising somehow"influences" adolescents.  As mentioned above, this portion of the study shows,at most, that young people are aware of cigarette advertising; it does not evenpurport to address the issue of "influences."122]<p><tt><b>			(4)	FDA's "Evidence" Regarding Advertising</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Recall, Approval of Advertising, and</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Young People's Response to Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Does Not Support FDA's ProposedRegulations</b></tt><p><p><tt>	In support of its claim that young people are aware of cigaretteadvertisements, FDA cites two findings from a 1992 Gallup survey</tt>"fn215" [123:  (1) half of the adolescent respondentscould identify the brand name associated with one of four cigarette slogans,and (2) 87 percent of adolescents surveyed could recall seeing one or morecigarette advertisements.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.<p>	The Gallup survey findings, however, do not establish a link betweenadvertising recognition or recall and ]<tt>smoking behavior.  Infact, the Gallup survey findings are inconsistent with any such causalconnection.  To take the Camel slogan as just one example, the survey foundthat teens' ability to match the "Smooth Character" slogan with the Camel brandis high in all regions of the country, ranging from a low of 33.5 percent inthe South to a high of 36.2 percent in the West.  Camel's market share amongteen smokers, however, exhibits much greater variation-- from 4.9 percentin the East (where 33.9 percent of teens match the slogan correctly) to 36.3percent in the West.  Thus, there is no apparent relationship between teens'ability to match the Camel slogan and their decisions about what brand tosmoke.  The data suggest that, in the East, the vast majority of teens who canmatch the slogan choose some other brand to smoke.</tt><p><tt>	The finding that 87 percent of adolescents surveyed could recall seeingone or more tobacco advertisements is also inconsistent with FDA's theory.  Therecall for Camel advertising was about the same for smokers (60percent)and nonsmokers (57percent), and was far greater than Camel'smarket share.  Thus, there is not even a meaningful correlation betweenCamel advertising recall and smoking behavior.  The mere fact that 87 percentof the adolescents could recall seeing a tobacco advertisement, when no morethan a small fraction of all teens are classified as smokers,</tt>"fn216" [124 further undermines FDA's attempt to linkrecall with smoking behavior.<p>	FDA also cites several studies for the proposition that "children who smokeare more likely to correctly identify cigarette advertisements and slogans inwhich the product names have been removed than are non-smokers."125  Not onlydo these studies contain significant flaws; but, as their authors acknowledge,none of them suggests that awareness of cigarette advertising, brand names, orlogos ]<tt>causes children to smoke or to increase cigarette usage.It is just as likely (indeed intuitively more likely) that being smokerscaused study subjects to have heightened awareness of cigarette advertising.</tt><p><tt><b>				1.  Chapman &amp; Fitzgerald</b>  (60 Fed. Reg.41,332)</tt><p><p><tt>	The first of the studies cited as evidence that awareness of advertisingis correlated with smoking was a 1980 survey by Chapman and Fitzgerald of 1195secondary school students in Sydney, Australia.</tt>"fn220" [126  The authors tested three hypotheses.First, they found that 7th and 8th graders who smoked were approximately twiceas likely as nonsmokers of the same age to be able to identify cigaretteadvertisements and ad slogans.  Second, they reported that "heavy" smokers weremore likely to prefer a specific brand of cigarette.  These apparent resultsled the authors to suggest that developing a brand preference is part of one'ssmoking "career."  The third hypothesis-- that the ads recognized most byparticipants would be those for brands most used by them-- could not beestablished from the study.<p>	The Chapman and Fitzgerald survey suffers from a number of significantdeficiencies.  First, and most importantly, although the study reports acorrelation between smoking status and ad recognition, the results do notdemonstrate any causal relationship between the two variables.127  The authors,themselves, admit as much:  "The role played by advertising in the decision tosmoke clearly needs refining conceptually so the appropriate questions may beasked in research."128  <p>	Aitken and Eadie admit that finding a relationship between ad recognition andsmoking status<p>"[does] not necessarily mean that advertising plays an important part ininducing children to start smoking.  Cause-and-effectrelationships are always difficult to disentangle.  For example, children maybecome more aware and appreciative of cigarette advertising]<tt>after they start smoking."</tt>"fn224" [129<p><p>FDA therefore cannot rely on this study to establish causation.<p>	In addition, the authors failed to control for variance among prioradvertising exposure levels.  This failure renders their conclusions relatingto ad recognition invalid.  Ad recognition may well be a function more of priorexposure to ads than of current smoking behavior.130  Moreover, because thesample was not entirely representative of the relevant population(overrepresenting females and 8th graders), or entirely random, the conclusionsdrawn from it are subject to important limitations.  The number of studentssurveyed within each school varied based upon individual teacher participation.The authors commented:  "Any conclusions arising from the study may not warrantgeneralization to school children at large but to school children with teachersinterested in running such a [health education] program."  Finally, the surveydefined a "smoker" as someone who had "smoked within the last four weeks."]<p><tt><b>				2.  Aitken &amp; Eadie</b>  (60 Fed. Reg. 41,332)</tt><p><tt>	A second survey cited by FDA for the proposition that children who smokeare more likely to correctly identify cigarette ads suffers from the sameinability to demonstrate any causal connection.  In 1988, Aitken and Eadieinterviewed 848 Glasgow, Scotland adolescents between the ages of 11 and14.</tt>"fn225" [131  Spurred in part by theChapman and Fitzgerald research, the authors conducted a more rigorous study todetermine whether underage smokers' increased ability to recognize or identifycigarette advertising is independent of important influences on underagesmoking.  Although the authors found that the differences between underagesmokers and nonsmokers in ad recognition capabilities were independent of otherfactors, this conclusion is not relevant to the causation issue.  As noted,Aitken and Eadie acknowledged that their survey was designed to testcorrelation, and thus cannot be used by FDA to establish causation.132  ]<p><tt><b>				3.  Goldstein et al.</b>  (60 Fed.

As the authors of the study admit:<p>"[T]he data do not identify which is cause and which is effect.  It could beargued that smokers simply pay more attention to cigarette advertising as partof the brand selection process or that smokers are more likely to recognizetheir own brands....  Our study provides some of the firstevidence for a relationship between these variables.  Further research will benecessary to determine if advertising is causally related to adolescentsmoking."134<p><p>	The Goldstein study, moreover, suffers from serious methodological defects.It involved a convenience (rather than a random) sample of students at oneprivate high school.  Participants were predominantly white and upper-middleclass.  Thus, they were not representative of the overall high schoolpopulation.  In addition, because the sample of 306 students included 61 highschool seniors, many of whom were likely to be 18 years old (and possiblyolder), responses cannot be said to represent only "children" or "underage"smokers.  To the contrary, because 11th and 12th graders comprised well overhalf of the "regular smoker" group, it is likely that this group (at leastamong the seniors) included participants age 18 and above.]<p><tt><b>				4.  Botvin et al.</b>  (60 Fed.

If thatwere the case, that would support the consistency theory idea that peopleselectively attend to information that is consonant with their personalbehavior."</tt>"fn231" [136<p><p>	The authors surveyed 602 junior high school students from four middle-class,suburban schools in the spring of 1986.  Students were asked a series ofquestions about their background, smoking knowledge, and smoking behavior.They were also queried as to their level of exposure to cigarette print ads.An "exposure" scale was developed based on the frequency of respondents'exposure to certain periodicals containing cigarette ads and their review ofcigarette ads contained within each periodical.  Correlations were computedbetween advertisement exposure and demographic, psychosocial, social influence,and smoking knowledge variables.  In addition, several multiple regressionanalyses were used to examine the role of cigarette advertising in promotingand supporting cigarette smoking.  The most important predictor of cigarettesmoking was friends' smoking behavior.  Advertising exposure scored a distantsecond, just ahead of several other variables tested.137<p>	As with the ad recognition studies, the Botvin study suffers from severalsignificant limitations.  ]First, as discussed in greater detail below, relianceupon the participants' own estimate of their exposure to advertising issuspect, because smokers are more likely to notice cigarette advertisementsthan are nonsmokers.</tt>"fn234" [138  Thus, actual]<tt>exposure rates for smokers may not be significantly differentfrom those for nonsmokers.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, because the majority of participants in the study werewhite, middle-class adolescents, the findings cannot be generalized to otherpopulations.

The authors hypothesized that (1)experimentation with cigarettes would prompt subjects to attend to, and retaininformation from, cigarette ads, and (2) exposure to cigarette ads, mediated bythe depth to which information from those ads was processed, would promptsubjects to experiment with cigarettes.  <p>	Adolescent subjects144 were shown a series of magazine and newspaperadvertisements for cigarettes, alcohol and perfume from which product and brandidentifying information had been removed.  For each ad, respondents were askedwhether they recalled having ever seen the ad before.  They were then asked todetermine whether the ad was for cigarettes, alcohol, or perfume.  Finally,depending upon their response to the second question, they were shown a list of20brands and asked to indicate which brand was being advertised.  Datawere also collected on respondents' current and past smoking behavior, certaindemographic characteristics, and total exposure to magazines and newspapers.<p>	The authors performed a number of regression analyses to examine therelationship among four dependent variables (overall ad recognition, product-typerecognition, individual brand recognition, and smoking status) and sixindependent variables (overall magazine exposure, gender, grade group, stimulusset (ads shown), school district, and socioeconomic status).  They concludedthat adolescents who had experimented with cigarettes were better able torecognize advertised products than those who had not, and that subjects whowere better at recognizing advertising brands were more likely to haveexperimented with cigarettes.  According to the authors, these results(particularly the latter) are ]<tt>consistent with their thesis thatadvertising exposure can affect smoking behavior.</tt><p><tt>	Contrary to FDA's summary of the Klitzner study, however, its results donot show causality, and the authors did not claim otherwise.  Theymerely fail to disprove the authors' hypotheses.  In fact, Klitzner et al.explicitly warn against the sort of assertions of causality made by FDA.  "Inany cross-sectionalstudy it is impossible to directly test the causal relationships between anyset of variables.  The temporal information necessary to establish antecedentcauses is not available."</tt>"fn251" [145Additionally, "it is important to note that inferring causal relationships fromcorrelation data is, in general, a risky enterprise.  For any single set ofcorrelational data there is an infinite variety of causal models which may beinferred to generate it."146  In other words, the study can at best be viewedas not inconsistent with the authors' hypotheses.  The results do not prove (oreven demonstrate) causation, and would also be consistent with a large numberof alternative explanatory models.<p>	Moreover, given the severe limitations of the study, as discussed below, it isunlikely that the results are useful at all.]First, the study fails to account satisfactorily for therelative influence of other predictors of experimentation with smoking, such asparental and peer modeling, attitudes towards smoking, and so on.  This failureprecludes comparisons of the relative contribution of advertising exposure withthose of other possible determinants.  Thus, the study fails to take adequateaccount of the likelihood that a subject who, for other reasons, iscontemplating experimentation would retain more information from cigaretteadvertisements prior to beginning actual experimentation.  Indeed, the authorsthemselves admit that the variable they chose did not enable them to accountfor the influence of other predictors of smoking experimentation.</tt>"fn253" [147]Second, the measure of advertising exposure was notcontemporaneous with the subjects' experimentation with smoking.  Subjects mayhave experimented with cigarettes some years before their involvement in thestudy.  The advertisements used in the study, then, would not be those to whichthey were exposed at the time of their initial experimentation.  Moreover, thecognitive retention measures taken of the subjects at the time of the studymight well differ from those at the time of smoking initiation.</tt><p><tt>	Third, the study makes a major methodological error.  Smokingstatus was defined as a binary variable, which had a value of 1 if anindividual had ever smoked a cigarette, and was 0 otherwise:</tt><p><tt>"It was assumed that mere interest in cigarette smoking (reflected in evenbrief occasions of cigarette use) was sufficient to indicate some influence ofcigarette advertising upon smoking behavior."</tt>"fn254" [148<p><p>In other words, if a subject had ]<tt>ever smoked a single cigarettein the past, he was considered a smoker, and therefore was considered to havebeen influenced by cigarette ads shown by the authors at the time of thesurvey.  The authors assume that the number of current advertisementexposures as measured in the study is the same as the amount of advertisingthat subjects were exposed to at the time they first experimented withcigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	The authors admit that use of this binary variable to measure smokingstatus "was not optimal."</tt>"fn255" [149Especially given that over 1/2 (53 percent) of the "smokers" identified by thisvariable did not consider themselves "smokers" at the time the survey wastaken, this mistake renders the study's results meaningless.]<p><tt><b>				2.

First,the authors incorrectly categorized individuals into comparison groups.  Sevensubjects who stated at the first interview that they "didn't know" whether theywould smoke when older, indicated one year later that they "wouldsmoke."</tt>"fn260" [155  Although theseindividuals displayed a "more positive" intention, they were not included inthe "more positive" group.156  Instead, they were classified as part of thecontrol group against which those with "more negative" intentions arecompared.157  Similarly, five individuals who indicated that they "would smoke"at the time of the first interview changed their answer to "don't know" in thesecond survey, a "more negative" intention.158  Yet they were left out of theauthors' "more negative" group.159  On this basis alone, the study's resultsshould be discarded:  arbitrary classifications or exclusions of data destroythe validity and reliability of a study.<p>	Second, the statistical methods employed by the authors are inappropriate toanalyze the data collected.  Aitken, et al. seek to explain the factorsunderlying a subject's change in intention (the dependent variable).  Althoughthe authors employ standard multiple regression techniques to analyze theirdata, they use a binary variable (]<tt>i.e. --either a "1" or a "0") to measure change in smoking intention.  The use of abinary dependent variable with standard multiple regression techniques has beenshown to produce unreliable results.  In other words, the statistical teststhat the authors use to determine whether a correlation exists between a changein intention to smoke and cigarette advertising are not valid to measure such arelationship.</tt>"fn265" [160  Thus, the authors'conclusions are based on faulty statistical results.<p>	Even if the study's methods were valid, however, the authors' conclusions arenot proven by their results.  At most, their findings demonstrate only acorrelation.  Although this correlation is not ]<tt>inconsistentwith the authors' causal claims, it does not establish them.  The data showthat correctly identifying cigarette advertising is not the only factorcorrelated with a positive change in smoking intention; statisticallysignificant correlations also exist for prior smoking, having friends whosmoke, socioeconomic status, and age.</tt>"fn266" [161  Thus, other variables can explain thereported changes in intention.]<p><tt><b>				3.  O'Connell et al.</b>  (60 Fed. Reg.41,332)</tt><p><tt>	This study reports a correlation between adolescents'smoking behavior and their attitudes toward cigarette advertising.</tt>"fn267" [162  Teens who smoke are more likely to"approve" of cigarette advertisements.163  From this, the authors state: "Ourdata suggest to us that intervention in the field of cigarette advertising maybe the most direct and effective means of reducing the prevalence of smoking inchildren."  ]<tt>Id<i>.</i> at 230.  This statement implies thatcigarette advertising causes children to start smoking.  However, such aconclusion is not supported by the data.</tt><p><tt>	In fact, the authors themselves admit that the data do not enable them "toidentify which is the antecedent factor (approval of advertising or smokingbehavior)."  Id<i>.</i>  Thus, an alternate interpretation of the datais that children begin to approve of cigarette advertising only after theystart smoking (for whatever reason).  This seems to be a plausible explanationof the data:  It is entirely commonplace for people to approve of theadvertising of products or services that they use themselves.</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, it is entirely plausible that all or most of the correlation isexplained by common dependence on an independent, third variable.  For example,if antismoking parents instill in their children antismoking attitudes, thechildren are likely not to smoke and are also likely to have a negative view ofsmoking and of cigarette advertisements.  For these children, the correlationbetween not smoking and a negative view of cigarette advertisements is due, notto any causal connection between those two variables, but to the causal effectof an independent, third variable -- parental influence.  Similarly, parentswho are indifferent toward smoking and cigarette ads, or who themselves smokeand are favorably disposed to such ads, are likely to instill in their childrensimilar attitudes and similar behavior with respect to cigarettes.  Thus, inchildren of all three types of parents, smoking behavior will be correlatedwith attitude toward cigarette advertisements.  That correlation will notresult from any causal relationship between those two variables, but from theircommon dependence on an independent, third variable.  For example, healthylawns are likely to be correlated with sidewalks that are frequently wet; buthealthy lawns do not cause sidewalks to be wet, and wet sidewalks do not causelawns to be healthy; rather, lawns are healthy and sidewalks are frequently wetin places where it frequently rains.</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, even if approval of advertising were shown to be theantecedent factor, causation still cannot be shown based on the data in thisstudy.  Because the various indicators have not been isolated, it is impossibleto show which factors might act as influences on a child's smoking behaviorindependent of the other factors.  The data the authors give in Table 1 intheir article can be interpreted in a slightly different way that makes itpossible to compare those data to the data in Table 2 in their article in ameaningful manner:</tt><p><tt>	<b>Table 1</b></tt>"fn272" [164]<b>Attitudes of 273 "Regular" Smokers</b></tt><p><tt> Approval of	Number of	  Percentage of</tt><p><tt>Cigarette Ads?

Furthermore, it follows that nearlyall (perhaps, all) of the regular smokers who approve of cigarette advertisinghave friends who smoke.  Interpreting the data in this manner leads to theconclusion that having friends who smoke is strongly correlated with (a)approval of cigarette advertising and (b) smoking.  Even if the approval ofcigarette advertising precedes smoking, no causal link between theadvertisement and the smoking is shown; rather, the friends' smoking causesboth phenomena, each of which is independent of the other.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the authors state that in an earlier study they found that "anoverwhelming proportion" of the children who claimed to smoke claimed to smokeonly one brand.</tt>"fn272" [166  From this findingthey concluded:  "This suggests to us that cigarette advertising plays a majorrole in encouraging children to commence and continue smoking."167  Theconclusion, however, does not follow because (1)influences other thanadvertising may account for brand loyalty (]<tt>e.g., thebrand smoked by friends or parents; the brand available from the child's(illicit) source of supply) and (2)a finding that advertising accountedfor brand loyalty would say nothing about the influence of advertising on thebasic decision to smoke or to continue smoking.</tt>"fn274" [168  For example, it is implausible thatautomobile advertising is what causes 16-year-olds to want to drive -- that, ifsuch advertising were banned, they would not want to drive.  Similarly, thefact that advertising for Ford or Chevrolet may strengthen "brand loyalty" doesnot suggest that such advertising creates the desire to drive. ]<p><tt><b>				4.  Alexander et al.</b>  (60 Fed. Reg. 41,332)</tt><p><tt>	This study was conducted as a follow-up to the O'Connell study discussedabove, and suffers from similar limitations.  One year after the initial study,the authors surveyed the same group of Australian students tested.</tt>"fn274" [169  The respondents were classified intofour categories:  (1) original nonsmokers who remained nonsmokers;(2)original nonsmokers who adopted smoking during the interval period;(3) original smokers who remained smokers; and (4) original smokers who quitduring the interval period.  After demonstrating that several variables,including whether the respondent approved of cigarette advertising, werecorrelated with smoking behavior, the authors concluded that "legislationbanning the advertising of cigarettes is required to counter the predisposingand reinforcing effects of this advertising on children."170<p>	This conclusion, however, is without support.  Although the study employedboth regression and variance analysis to establish correlations between smokingbehavior over time and a number of variables, including approval of cigaretteadvertising, it offered no evidence of causation.  Children who approved ofcigarette ads were reportedly more likely to begin smoking and less likely toquit smoking than their counterparts who disapproved; but this differencesimply does not establish a causal role for advertising.  Again, thesevariables are very likely to be mutually independent but jointly dependent onother independent variables such as the influence of parents and peers.  Ingeneral, actual and imminent users of any product are more likely to recognizeand approve of its advertising.  Yet this fact does not yield the conclusionthat advertising "causes" a person to begin to use, or to continue using, aproduct.  <p>	The authors also fail to address the relatively simple notion that approval ofcigarette advertising might be dependent upon preestablished feelings about (orexperience with) cigarette usage, rather than the reverse.  It is a matter ofcommon sense that adolescents with positive, preexisting feelings about (and/orexperiences with) cigarettes are more likely to approve of cigaretteadvertising, and that those with negative feelings and/or experiences are morelikely to disapprove.  It follows that those in the former category would alsobe more likely to begin or continue smoking, and that those in the latter groupwould be more inclined to refrain from and/or quit smoking.  Thus, as noted inthe discussion above, advertising approval is likely to be correlated with (andeven dependent upon) a host of other variables that affect smoking behavior.Thus, the positive correlation does not establish a causal relationship.<p>	In addition, other factors such as age group, having friends who smoke, andhaving siblings who smoke, were more significantly correlated with smokingstatus than were attitudes toward advertising.  If anything, the study wouldseem to reflect the power of age, family background, and peer pressure asinfluences on smoking, rather than any causal effect of advertising.]<p><tt><b>			(6)	 FDA's "Evidence" Concerning</b></tt><p><tt><b>				 Overestimation of Smoking Prevalence</b></tt><p><tt>				 <b>Does Not Support Its ProposedRegulations</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA next asserts that "overestimating smoking prevalence appears to be avery strong predictor of smoking initiation" and that "adolescent smokers aremore likely to overestimate the prevalence than adolescent non-smokers."  60Fed.

The Agency further suggests thatadvertising plays a role in the overestimation of smoking prevalence.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,332.  The objective of Chassin and Collins was to determine whichfactors correlate most strongly with smoking initiation and increases insmoking.  To do so, they studied teenagers at different "stages" of smokingbehavior (]<tt>i.e., nonsmoking, trying, and regular smoking)to determine which factors correlated with progression from one stage to thenext.

Their analyses and conclusions focusedonly on those subjects who progressed from being nonsmokers to being "triers,"or from being triers to smoking regularly, during the course of each study.<p>	Chassin studied middle and high school students who, over a one-yearperiod, either first tried smoking or progressed from having only tried toregular smoking.173  Chassin found that, in general, the "attitudinal" and"personality" variables correlated most strongly with smoking behavior forsubjects who increased from "triers" to regular smokers.174  "Environmental"and "personality" variables correlated most strongly with smokinginitiation.175<p>	Collins' study was similar to Chassin's.  Collins questioned approximately3000 seventh graders about their smoking behavior three times over asixteen-month period.176  Collins then regressed the subjects' smoking behaviorat each time period against five independent variables.177  Collins' resultswere consistent with Chassin's.  Not surprisingly, Collins found that the factthat a subject smoked at one time was the factor most strongly correlated withsmoking at the subsequent time.178  "Social disapproval," "risktaking/rebelliousness," and "perceived smoking prevalence" together contributedto predict smoking at the second period.179  "Risk taking/rebelliousness" and"perceived smoking prevalence" also predicted smoking at the third period."180Overall, Collins found significant statistical correlations between escalationin smoking behavior and each of the other variables ]<tt>except"consequences from smoking."</tt>"fn289" [181<p>	Chassin's and Collins' findings do not support either FDA's overall argumentor its assertion with respect to overestimation of smoking prevalence.  Asdiscussed below, there are five principal flaws that undermine these studies asbeing supportive of FDA's position.  First, and most important, these studiesdo not measure causation.  Second, contrary to FDA's assertion, these studiesdo not measure "overestimation" of smoking prevalence.  Third, Collins'variable that incorporated smoking prevalence estimates also reflected otherdata, which are not relevant to FDA's argument.  Similarly, Chassin'sconclusions regarding prevalence estimates also reflected data not relevant toFDA's assertion.  Prevalence estimates comprised only part of a "cluster" ofvariables Chassin refers to collectively in her conclusions as "environmental"factors.  Fourth, FDA ignores Chassin's and Collins' consistent findings thatfactors other than smoking prevalence estimates correlate strongly withincreases in smoking.  Finally, each study has design and methodologicaldeficiencies that undermine the reliability and applicability of itsresults.]<p><tt><b>				(a)  "Longitudinal" Studies Do Not</b></tt><p><tt>				     <b>Measure Causality            </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Chassin and Collins do not show a causal relationship betweensubjects' smoking prevalence estimates and increases in smoking behavior.Multiple regression analysis does not, and cannot, show that various factors(independent variables) cause any change in smoking behavior (the dependentvariable).  Regression analysis merely demonstrates that a correlation exists.For example, Chassin found a statistically significant correlationbetween a subject's positive attitude toward smoking and the subject's smokinginitiation.  This does not mean, however, that the subject's attitudecaused the subject to begin smoking.  The subject could have made thedecision to smoke based on entirely different factors, such as the fact thathis or her friends or parents smoked, or that the subject wanted to behave in a"risky" or "rebellious" manner.  Neither Chassin nor Collins attempts to studythe actual decision-making process involved in adolescents' decisions to beginsmoking or to become regular smokers.</tt><p><tt>	A related problem with these studies is that several of the variablesChassin and Collins tested are interrelated and/or interdependent.  Forexample, it is obvious that adolescents whose friends smoke are likely to havemore positive attitudes toward smoking than adolescents who are never exposedto smoking.  A subject who has a positive attitude toward smoking is morelikely than one with a negative attitude toward smoking to have friends whosmoke, and if so is more likely to take up smoking.  Moreover, the subject'sown smoking may reinforce his or her attitude toward smoking, as a means of"justifying" his or her behavior (see discussion of Sherman below).  Atbest, researchers can determine that smokers and those intending to smoke arelikely to exhibit a number of related characteristics.  </tt><p><tt>	The problem of interrelated and interdependent variables also applies tothe causes and/or effects of smoking prevalence estimates.  Some researchershave suggested that smokers tend to overestimate smoking prevalence, simplybecause smokers see and associate with other smokers.</tt>"fn290" [182  It is therefore likely that adolescents'preexisting association with smokers (parents, older siblings, older friends)or their own smoking naturally "causes" them to overestimate smokingprevalence.  This conclusion contradicts FDA's assertion that overestimation insome way "causes" smoking initiation and escalation.]<p><tt><b>				(b)	Chassin and Collins Do Not Measure "Overestimation" ofSmoking Prevalence</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Contrary to FDA's assertion, Chassin and Collins did not measureoverestimation of smoking prevalence.

Because of the manner in which Collins and Chassin developedvariables and presented their conclusions, the correlation between smokingbehavior and smoking prevalence estimates is even weaker than these studiessuggest.</tt><p><tt>	FDA is apparently relying upon Collins' finding that a positivecorrelation existed between subjects' estimations of smoking prevalence("perceived smoking prevalence") and their smoking behavior.  The "perceivedsmoking prevalence" variable, however, reflects subjects' estimates of societalsmoking prevalence as well as the level of smoking the subject perceived in hisor her own social environment.</tt>"fn292" [185"Perceived smoking prevalence" reflected subjects' responses to questionsregarding their friends' smoking habits and smoking among adults the subjectsknew and/or admired,186 in addition to estimates of smoking in general.  Onlythree of the nine questions upon which Collins based "perceived smokingprevalence" addressed subjects' estimates of smoking levels among individuals]<tt>outside the subject's immediate environment.</tt>"fn293" [187<p>	Chassin, unlike Collins, developed individual variables that reflectedsubjects' estimates of smoking prevalence among adults, teenagers, andstudents.  For example, a single variable reflected a subject's estimate of thenumber of adult men, out of 100, who smoke.188  However, Chassin expressed mostof her conclusions in terms of "clusters," or groups, of variables.  Inaddition to regressing smoking behavior against the individual variables,Chassin regressed smoking behavior against these clusters of related variables.One cluster, for example, consisted of the eight "environmental" variables(which included smoking prevalence estimates).  Chassin's conclusion that"environmental" factors contributed to subjects' smoking initiation reflectsthese subjects' exposure to "smoking models."189  The actual correlation ofsmoking behavior with smoking prevalence is therefore relatively weaker thanChassin suggests.<p>	In the end, the whole issue of advertising and overestimation of smokingprevalence is a red herring.  Why should anyone care whether young peopleoverestimate smoking prevalence?  Could anyone seriously suggest thatoverestimation is an independent variable?  Or that it ]<tt>causesyoung people to smoke?  It requires a far stretch of the imagination to suggestthat overestimation would exist independent of direct experience with parents,friends, or other close associates who smoke.</tt><p><tt>	A more plausible explanation is that young people whose parents or friendssmoke are themselves more likely (1)to smoke, (2)to pay attentionto advertising, and, it seems highly likely, (3)to over-estimatesmoking prevalence -- because people around them smoke.  The variablesof (1)smoking behavior, (2)attention to advertising, and(3)view of smoking prevalence, therefore, all correlate because they arevery strongly influenced by an independent variable -- influence of parentsor friends.  Thus, even if the studies cited by FDA demonstrated acorrelation between smoking status and overestimation of smoking behavior, thatcorrelation is irrelevant to the issue in the rulemaking.</tt><p><tt>	It cannot seriously be suggested that advertising causes young people tooverestimate prevalence.  No one advertises playing baseball.  If father,mother, and older siblings all play baseball, junior will overestimate theprevalence of baseball playing.  If Mom and Aunt Sally both have red hair,junior will overestimate the prevalence of red hair.  Suburban childrenprobably overestimate the prevalence of living in a house rather than anapartment.  Urban children probably overestimate the prevalence of apartments.All without any significant influence of advertising.</tt><p><tt><b>				(d)	FDA Ignores the Factors Found To Correlate</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Most Strongly with Smoking Behavior       </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA ignores the conclusion of Chassin and Collins that certain"personality" traits and exposure to smokers are the factors that correlatemost strongly with increases in subjects' smoking behavior-- a findingthat places Chassin and Collins, in this respect, well within the mainstream ofopinion.  These personality-related factors included Collins' measures ofsubjects' tendency to take risks or rebel against authority and theirperception of the risks associated with smoking.

Sussman'sobjective was to determine the causes -- not the effects-- ofadolescents' overestimates of smoking prevalence.  FDA, however, is attemptingto show that exposure to cigarette advertising causes overestimation of smokingprevalence, and that such overestimation causes smoking.

The study concludes that the two factors moststrongly correlated with the tendency to overestimate smoking prevalence are(1) exposure to persons who smoke (including oneself), and (2) a desire tojustify one's own so-called "deviant" behavior.204  (Sherman's regressionanalysis and the variables used are discussed below in this Volume.)<p>	Although Sherman's study appears to support FDA's assertion that adolescentsoverestimate smoking prevalence more than do adults, the totality of Sherman'sconclusions regarding adolescent and adult overestimation of smoking prevalenceis that:<p>"Adolescents who smoked estimated significantly higher numbers of smokers thandid adolescents who did not smoke.  In contrast, adult smokers and nonsmokersdid not differ in their prevalence estimates.  However, both adults andadolescents greatly overestimated the actual population smoking rates."205<p><p>None of these conclusions, of course, relates to causation of smoking.Moreover, the study's methodology was flawed, thereby undermining thereliability of its findings.

In derivingsmoking prevalence estimates, Sherman did not distinguish between "trying" and"regular smoking."

The Surgeon General also doesnot address whether Finnish children receive any information on smokingprevalence at school.

Botvin's Study of Exposure to Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Does Not Support FDA's Argument</b></tt><p><p><tt>	The Surgeon General also relies on Botvin to support the proposition thata relationship exists between cigarette advertising exposure and overestimationof smoking prevalence.</tt>"fn317" [213  Botvinstudied 602 seventh-and eighth-gradersto determine which factors correlate with smoking behavior.214  Botvin reportedthat a positive correlation exists between exposure to advertising andestimates of smoking prevalence.  His results, however, provide little supportfor the Surgeon General's position, and now FDA's position, for at least threereasons.<p>	First, Botvin did not actually measure "overestimation" of smoking prevalence.Rather, he measured subjects' perceptions of smoking among peers and adults.Botvin measured these perceptions by using subjects' estimates, which rangedfrom "none" to "all."  Botvin found that subjects who reported higher exposureto cigarette advertisements made higher estimates of peer and adult smokingthan did subjects who reported lower levels of advertising exposure.  The studygave no indication, however, that these estimates were in fact]<tt>overestimates.  To the extent that subjects based estimates ontheir direct experience with, and exposure to, smoking and smokers, theseestimates were likely realistic and relatively accurate.</tt><p><tt>	Second, the results do not show a causal relationship between advertisingexposure and smoking estimates.  In fact, Botvin points out the problem of"selective attention."</tt>"fn319" [215  "Selectiveattention" refers to the phenomenon, noted above, that smokers or potentialsmokers pay more attention to cigarette advertisements than do individuals withno intention of, or interest in, smoking.  Botvin also states that, althoughhis findings support the hypothesis that "cigarette advertising plays a role inthe smoking initiation process," the findings are merely "suggestive."216Individuals who make high estimates of smoking prevalence (namely, smokers andindividuals whose peers and family members smoke) are likely to be more awareof, or "tuned in" to, cigarette advertisements.<p>	Finally, an additional and related problem is the potential inaccuracy thatresults from relying on self-reported cigarette advertising exposure.Self-reported exposure to advertising is neither objective nor an independentfactor.<p>	Individuals who either smoke or are generally more aware of, or exposed to,smoking are likely to remember and report seeing more cigarette advertisementsas discussed above.  Different individuals may be "exposed" to the same numberof advertisements, but because of their "selective attention" to differentsubjects, an individual who generally is less exposed to and aware of and hasless interest in smoking is likely to report a lower level of cigaretteadvertising exposure.  However, individuals who already smoke, who alreadyintend to smoke, or who have generally positive attitudes toward smoking arealso the individuals who tend to make higher smoking prevalence estimates.217No causal relationships among these variables, however, has been proven.]<p><tt><b>			(11)	The Cited Studies Do Not Demonstrate</b></tt><p><tt><b>				a Causal Relationship Between Either</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Exposure to Advertising or</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Overestimation of Smoking Prevalence</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>and Intentions To Smoke             </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA relies upon Sherman (discussed above) to support its assertion thatoverestimation of smoking prevalence is positively correlated with intentionsto smoke.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  However, although this study may provide weaksupport for FDA's assertion about intentions to smoke, a positive correlationbetween these two factors is not evidence of a causal relationship betweenoverestimation of prevalence and intent to smoke.</tt><p><tt>	Sherman's study is cross-sectional, and his objective was to determine thecauses of overestimation.  To that end, he tested the hypothesis--suggested by other researchers as well as by common sense-- that anadolescent's positive attitude toward smoking, exposure to smokers, and ownsmoking behavior cause him or her to overestimate societal smoking prevalence.Clearly, these variables are all interrelated.  Indeed, the preponderance ofresearch on the causes of adolescent smoking suggests that exposure to smokersamong one's family and peers is the overwhelming cause of youth smokinginitiation.</tt><p><tt>	Sherman studied the correlation (for adolescents and adults) betweenoverestimation of smoking prevalence and four factors:  "selective exposure,""motivational distortion," "causal attributions," and "behavioralconformity."</tt>"fn321" [218  The "selectiveexposure" variable reflects the theory that "subjects' estimates of smokingprevalence should be related to the number of significant people in theirimmediate social environment who smoke."219  The "motivational distortion"factor reflects an individual's "need to justify" his or her behavioral choicesthat may be considered "negative or deviant" (such as the choice to smoke).220The "causal attribution" theory posits that "since actors attribute their ownbehavior to situational causes, they will see the same forces as influencinglarge numbers of other people....  Therefore, actorswill judge that there are relatively many people who share their beliefs orbehaviors."221  The "behavior conformity" theory is that when individuals judgea particular behavior to be "widespread and commonly acceptable," they willshape their behavior to that "perceived majority."222<p>	Sherman regressed nonsmoking adolescents' prevalence estimates against thesubjects' behavioral intentions to determine whether prevalence estimatespredicted "their behavioral intentions about smoking in the future."223  Theresult showed a statistically significant but weak correlation betweenprevalence estimates and behavioral intentions.224  <p>	More importantly, however, Sherman asked his subjects to estimate smokingprevalence among schoolmates.  He thus instructed them to base their estimateson their direct experience, rather than on more generalized perceptions.  Thereis no reason to believe that exposure to, or prevalence of, cigaretteadvertising would have any effect on estimates of smoking among one's friendsand acquaintances.  It is misleading for FDA to rely on these data to arguethat cigarette advertising affects prevalence estimates.  In addition to beingweak, however, Sherman's results are not suited for FDA's use for at least tworeasons.]First, Sherman did not use "overestimation" of societalsmoking prevalence to perform his regression analyses.  Although he noted thatadolescents overestimated smoking prevalence, he obtained his variables byasking subjects to estimate smoking prevalence among boys, girls, and adults,with questions such as "[o]ut of every 100 boys in your school, how many ofthem smoke cigarettes?"</tt>"fn328" [225  Shermanscaled the responses on a seven-point scale ranging from "less than 10 percent"to "86 to 100 percent."226  This measurement does not in any way measure]<tt>overestimation.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, the correlation between prevalence estimates and intentionsto smoke is even weaker than the statistical correlation suggests.  InSherman's "behavioral intentions" variable, "intentions to smoke" were only onecomponent.</tt>"fn330" [227  Sherman's result was astatistically significant, but weak, correlation between the variables.228  Theactual predictive effect of "intentions to smoke" is impossible to determinebecause the value representing smoking intentions was combined with otherbehavioral factors.]<p><tt><b>			(12)	FDA's "Evidence" That Youth Brand </b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Choices Are Related to Advertising</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA next turns to evidence suggesting that (1)adolescents tend tosmoke the most heavily advertised brands and (2)the market share forthese brands among adolescent smokers is greater than the market share forthese brands among adult smokers.  60 Fed.

From these twopropositions, FDA reasons that advertising has a distinct influence onadolescents' smoking decisions and that restricting advertising will reducethat influence.  60 Fed.

Therefore, the CDC Studydoes not establish even that changes in adolescent brand preference arecorrelated with changes in advertising expenditures, much less that changes inadvertising expenditures cause changes in adolescent brand preferences.It is not clear from the CDC Study, moreover, whether the changes inadvertising expenditures for any of the three brands preceded or followed thechanges in adolescent brand preference.</tt><p><tt><b>				2.  The Goldstein Study</b></tt><p><tt>	Goldstein studied a sample of 306 ninth-through twelfth-gradestudents at a single private high school.

Although Goldstein noted that]<tt>other research has found that adolescents smoke a smallernumber of different brands than do adults, Goldstein tested only thecorrelation between adolescent smoking and advertising recognition.  He did notknow which brands the adolescents in his study smoked.</tt><p><tt>	More significantly, Goldstein's study does not demonstrate anyrelationship between advertising recognition or brand choice and the decisionto begin smoking.  As the author states, arguably "smokers simply pay moreattention to cigarette advertising as part of the brand selection processor...are more likely to recognize their ownbrands."</tt>"fn338" [234  Alternatively, assuggested by Botvin, smokers may be more aware of and more likely to remembercigarette advertisements in general than are nonsmokers.235  Goldstein himselfnoted that "[f]urther research will be needed to determine if brand preferenceis a marker for identifying those students at risk for developing more regularsmoking habits."236  Given these limitations, FDA cannot rely upon Goldstein'sstudy of adolescents' advertising and logo recognition to support its generalassertion that adolescents' choices of cigarette brands are directly related tothe amount and kind of advertising to which they are exposed.237    ]<p><tt><b>			(13)	FDA's Reliance upon Studies Evaluating</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Effects of "Joe Camel" and "Reg"</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Advertising Campaigns Is Misplaced    </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The FTC, after an exhaustive investigation, found no link between the JoeCamel campaign and increased smoking among young people.

Reg. 41,333.  In support of itsthesis, FDA cites two articles that appeared in the 1991 Journal of theAmerican Medical Association-- the "Pierce study" and the "Fischerstudy."</tt>"fn342" [240  According to the Piercestudy, teenagers were twice as likely as adults to identify Camel cigarettes asbeing one of the two most advertised brands.241  Again, however, this studyfails to establish any relationship between perceiving that a cigarette brandis heavily advertised (or simply naming a brand) and a decision to smoke.Indeed, the study did not even measure exposure to advertising.  Instead, itassumed that subjects had seen (and remembered) cigarette advertising, and thenasked them to give a best estimate about the relative frequency of advertisingfor different brands.  Thus, it measured the participants' judgment as to thebrand of cigarettes most advertised.<p>	The weaknesses in the relationship between judgments about relative amounts ofadvertising and brand choice are apparent in Pierce's data for Marlboro.  Amongteens, 41.8percent identify Marlboro as the most heavily advertisedbrand, but 55percent of boys and 64percent of girls report thatthey smoke Marlboro.  Further, boys are more likely to identify Marlboro asmost advertised, but girls are more likely to smoke Marlboro.  The only thingthat the Pierce study does demonstrate is that Camel and Marlboro were thoughtto be the most advertised brands among all respondent age groups.  This resultproves nothing.  In fact, the Beales study242 demonstrates that teens who thinkCamel is the most advertised brand, correctly or incorrectly, are not morelikely to smoke than teens identifying another brand, rightly or wrongly.<p>	Moreover, although Pierce employs a representative sample of California, hisconclusions are based largely on a comparison of California data from 1990 withnational data from 1986.  That comparison is invalid because Camel had aconsiderably larger market share in California than it did nationwide, bothbefore and after its "Smooth Character" campaign.  In 1987, Camel's Californiamarket share was approximately 63 percent greater than its national share.This inapt comparison results in deceptive "growth rates," when, in fact,Camel's California market share actually declined slightly between 1987 and1990.243<p>	FDA also cites the Pierce study finding that over 34 percent of 12- to13-year-old California children could name a brand of advertised cigarettes.60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  As discussed above, however, brand recognition or recallis not causally related to teen smoking initiation.<p>	The Fischer study measured recognition of product logos among 229 preschoolchildren from 3 to 6 years old.  Specifically, FDA cites the study's findingthat 30 percent of 3-year-oldsand 90 percent of 6-year-oldscorrectly matched Joe Camel with a picture of a cigarette.  60 Fed. Reg.41,333.  Awareness of brand logos, however, says nothing about desire for aproduct, much less the likelihood of future purchases of the product.  <p>	Children and adults recognize a large number of brands they do not use.  Infact, a study conducted by Richard Mizerski demonstrates that children whorecognized Joe Camel were more likely to ]<tt>dislike cigarettesthan children who did not recognize Joe Camel.</tt>"fn344" [244  <p>	Recognition of all trade characters except the Marlboro cowboy wassignificantly related to age, with older children better able to match thecharacter and the product.  For cereals, hamburgers, and the Disney Channel,attitudes toward the product were also positively related to age -- that is,older children were both more likely to recognize the trade character and morelikely to like the product.  Contrary to FDA's theory, however, for Joe Camel,while older children were significantly more likely to recognize Joe Camel (bymatching him with a cigarette), they were actually less likely to likecigarettes.245  Indeed, ]<tt>at every age, children who recognizedJoe Camel were more likely to dislike cigarettes than children who didnot recognize Joe Camel.  Professor Goff's statement is very critical of theFDA's superficial conclusions about the effect of imagery on youth smoking:"such research never establishes a link between logo recognition by childrenwith positive affect for the product, let alone product purchase oruse."</tt>"fn346" [246<p>	FDA also fails to assess parental intervention.  A recent study247 shows thatparents use Joe Camel to "teach and reinforce their children's views about thenegative effects of smoking."  The trade character has even been used byparents who believe their children are unaware of Joe Camel.  Thus, althoughrecognition may be high, awareness of Joe Camel cannot be positively related tosmoking.<p>	Finally, the Pierce and Fischer studies both fail to meet even minimumstandards for scientific research, and have been strongly criticized bycredible researchers, all of whom have expressed major concerns about thequality, validity, and reliability of the studies.248  The researchers whoreviewed the studies were particularly concerned by the "advocacy position"taken by the authors.<p>		In support of its hypothesis that the Camel campaign has influenced teens'decisions to begin smoking, FDA claims that Camel's<p>popularity among underage smokers rose substantially after the campaign began,while the brand's share of the adult market remained steady.  FDA cites anumber of studies in an attempt to support this claim.249  Contrary to FDA'sview, however, the 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Survey ("TAPS II")demonstrates that the brand's popularity among underage smokers has increasedat a ]<tt>lower rate than its share of young adult smokers,18-22 years old.  That young adult segment was the campaign's intended audienceand is the appropriate and fair market with which to make such a comparison.</tt><p><tt><b>				2.</b>  <b>The "Reg" Promotional Campaign</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that cigarette advertising campaigns can have a "profoundeffect" on the youth "market," and that "promotional campaigns can be extremelyeffective with young people."</tt>"fn349" [250  Inan attempt to support this assertion, FDA discusses Imperial Tobacco's "Reg"advertising campaign ("the Reg Campaign").  The Reg Campaign featured acharacter named "Reg," whom FDA describes as "flippant and humorous."251  Theadvertisements, according to the adults who conducted the study, portrayed Regas a "humorous," "entertaining" and "down-to-earth" character, who mockedserious issues, including antismoking campaigns.252]<p><tt><b>					(a)	FDA's Claim That the "Reg" Campaign</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Was Particularly Effective with</b></tt><p><tt><b>						British Adolescents Is Based on</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Unreliable Evidence and Is Not</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Applicable to American Adolescents </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA cites a British study on the Reg Campaign performed by the Universityof Stratchclyde's Centre for Social Marketing</tt>"fn350" [253 to support its assertion.  The objectiveof the Stratchclyde Study was to determine the effects and appeal of the RegCampaign among British teenagers and adults.  The Study relied on bothquantitative and qualitative data.  Quantitative data on smoking levels amongBritish adults and teenagers were obtained from three separate nationalsurveys.254  Qualitative data regarding teenagers' and adults' reactions to theReg Campaign were obtained through group discussions, in which participantswere divided into small groups according to age.255  The study reached twogeneral conclusions:  (1)the Reg Campaign was more "effective" withteenagers than with adults; and (2)the campaign positively affectedsmoking initiation among teenagers.]<p><tt><b>					(b)  Weaknesses of the Stratchclyde Study</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA misunderstands the Stratchclyde Study, and the Agency's reliance onthe study is misplaced for several reasons.  </tt><p><tt>	First, FDA's comments suggest that a causal link was shown betweenrecognition of the Reg advertisements and teenagers' tendency to begin smoking.FDA asserts that "[t]eenagers who liked the [Reg Campaign] advertisements weremore likely to smoke."</tt>"fn353" [256 <p>	Responses obtained during the study suggest, however, that, to the extent thatany "causal" relationship exists, being a smoker "caused" or enabled subjectsto recognize and enjoy the Reg advertisements, not the other way around.  Forexample, the study concluded that, although "some of the nonsmoking 12-to-15-year-oldsand almost all the 10 to 11-year-oldswere struggling to understand the creative content of the adverts, particularlythe humour...many of the older and smoking respondentsdid understand the humor, and this contributed to their enjoyment of thecampaign."257  <p>	Other responses suggested (to the study's authors) that the Reg Campaign'sappeal to smokers lay in the fact that Reg provided a means of "justifying"smoking.  For example, Reg supposedly "mocked" antismoking efforts258 andconveyed the message to smokers that they did not need to have a good reasonfor smoking.259  The authors claimed that this message "struck a welcome chordwith youngsters, who felt increasingly persecuted for smoking," and that Regtransmitted "empathetic messages to young people."260  The authors also statedthat "Reg provided the adolescents with an ally against all the antismokingpressure and propaganda, even more than other cigarette advertising."261  <p>	These conclusions suggest, however, only that the Reg Campaign would have beenmore appealing to smokers than to nonsmokers, whether adolescents or adults.Nothing in the study supports the conclusion that the campaign influencedanyone to begin smoking.  ]Second, the Stratchclyde Study measured "recognition" in ahighly suggestive manner that was likely to yield disparate results betweenteenagers and adults.  The Study obtained recognition rates for the Regadvertisements by showing subjects an example of a Reg advertisement and askingwhether they had seen it or a similar advertisement.</tt>"fn356" [262  The reported recognition rates werehigh:  After being shown a Reg advertisement, 91 percent of 11- to15-year-olds, 55 percent of 9-and 10-year-olds, and 52 percent of adults (age 32 to 55) recognized theadvertisement.  ]<tt>Id<i>.</i> at 934.  The rates for teenagers andadolescents, however, likely resulted from the suggestive method in which thedata were obtained.  </tt><p><tt>	The subjects were shown the advertisements prior to being questioned.  Inaddition, the teenage and other younger subjects-- but not theadults-- were engaged in a series of games that involved matchingproducts and slogans, describing advertisements and products, and designingtheir own cigarette advertisements.</tt>"fn357" [263  By these means, the teenagers were"warmed up" or "taught" to recognize cigarette advertisements.  <p>	Moreover, since this preparation at least suggested to the subjects that theresearch involved cigarettes and advertising, teenagers and younger childrenmay have felt that responding positively (]<tt>i.e., thatthey had seen the ads) was the "correct" response.</tt>"fn359" [264  They therefore may have been more likelyto give positive responses than if they had not been so prepared.  By contrast,the group discussions with adults involved far less suggestion.  The adultdiscussions did not include the preliminary "games."265  Moreover, even thoughthe adults, like the children, were shown the Reg ads, and even if the adultsknew the study involved cigarette advertising, it is logical to assume thatadults would not feel as pressured as would children to give the "correct"answer.]Third, the nature of the Reg Campaign and the Britishteenagers' responses to it suggest that the results of the Stratchclyde Studyare not relevant to cigarette advertising in the United States.  The studysuggests that much of the Reg Campaign's supposed appeal to teenagers was dueto the fact that teenagers could relate to Reg --that Reg was "down to earth" and similar to people they knew.  For example, 14-and 15-year-old female smokers described Reg as "a man aged 18-20 who mighttake them out and who would be fun, fairly ordinary, and make badjokes...much like the boys they already knew."</tt>"fn360" [266  Responses also suggest that teenagersliked Regal cigarettes specifically because of the brand's "ordinary" and "downto earth" image, while "[o]ther brands tended to be rejected as toopretentious."267  <p>	Antismoking advocates commonly describe U.S. cigarette advertising, bycontrast, as conveying idealized individuals and lifestyles to whichadolescents can only aspire.  For example, Cohen characterizes U.S. cigaretteadvertising as "link[ing] smoking to success, social acceptance, sophisticationand a desirable and up-to-date lifestyle."268  The IOM Report similarlycontends that "[c]igarette advertisements capitalize on the disparity betweenan ideal and actual self-image and imply that smoking may close the gap,"269and that cigarette advertising "engages the consumer in a fantasy and invitesthe consumer to participate."270  These characterizations of U.S. cigaretteadvertising contrast markedly with the Reg Campaign, which apparently appealedto adolescents because of the ordinariness that it was said to associate withsmoking, along with its lack of pretension, glamour, and idealism.]<p><tt><b>			(14)  Conclusion</b></tt><p><tt>	On the whole, the studies cited by FDA for the proposition thatadvertising causes children to begin smoking do not address that issue and,even on their own terms, lack analytical rigor.  Even taken at face value, theydo not support the conclusions FDA advances.  Given the demonstrated role thatparents and other role models play in smoking by young people, the absence ofreal evidence that advertising has any significant effect in this regard, andthe lack of a reduction in smoking by youth in countries that have banned orseverely restricted cigarette advertising, there is no good reason to believethat FDA's proposed regulations relating to cigarette advertising would reducesmoking among young people.</tt><p><tt><b>		c.	Cigarette Advertising Does Not Cause Increased</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Smoking; Rather It Promotes Brand Choice, and </b></tt><p><tt><b>			a "Text-Only"Format Would Make Cigarette</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Advertising Invisible to Adults</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's contention that cigarette advertising-- especially "image"advertising-- influences young people to smoke overlooks the function ofadvertising in a "mature" product market such as the market for cigarettes,toothpaste, laundry detergent or automobiles.</tt>"fn368" [271  As the President's Council of EconomicAdvisors has stated:<p>"There is little evidence that advertising results in additional smoking.  Aswith many products, [cigarette] advertising mainly shifts consumers amongbrands."272<p><p>	In a mature product market, where the product category is long-establishedand awareness of the product category is universal, advertising generally doesnot operate to increase overall demand, among either young people or adults.Advertising operates, instead, to maintain or expand market share]<tt>within the product category-- to maintain the loyalty ofconsumers who already use the brand being advertised and to switch consumerswho use other brands.</tt>"fn369" [273<p>	To be successful, brand advertising must overcome two hurdles:  it mustattract the viewer's attention, and it must distinguish the advertised brandfrom the multitude of others on the market.  To break through the "clutter"that exists in the advertising marketplace, advertisers must frequently employvivid settings, bold graphic designs, and memorable brand slogans.  To separatethe advertised brand from its competitors, an advertiser must create a distinct"personality" for the brand.  Advertising that is prohibited from using colors,imagery, and graphics would be tantamount to no advertising at all.  Suchadvertisements would not attract the attention of smokers or distinguish onebrand from another.<p>	Allowing conventional image advertising only in selected "adult" publications,as FDA proposes, while prohibiting it in all other media, would leave cigarettemanufacturers only a token ability to advertise their products.  They would notbe able to communicate effectively with all the adults they reach now.<p>	FDA calls the amount spent on cigarette advertising and promotion "the mostcompelling piece of evidence" supporting its proposed restrictions on cigaretteadvertising and promotion.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,329.  It is not at all surprising,however, that cigarette manufacturers spend large sums to expand or to maintaintheir market share.  In the United States, with a total cigarette market ofover $45 billion, a single market-sharepoint was worth $450 million in sales in 1994; and, as discussed below,]<tt>one out of every four customers may switch among brands in anyparticular year.  Given the size of the market, the amounts spent bytobacco manufacturers on advertising are neither extraordinary norself-damning.</tt><p><tt>	The pages that follow discuss the nature of advertising in a mature marketand the function and value of image advertising.  Following that discussion, wedemonstrate that FDA exaggerates the impact of advertising.</tt><p><tt><b>			(1)	The Distinction Between "New" and</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>"Mature" Product Markets         </b></tt><p><p><tt>	All companies, cigarette manufacturers included, use advertising topromote their products.  Much advertising, including cigarette advertising,neither is intended to increase, nor has the effect of increasing, the numberof people who use the "product category."  Instead, advertising is used toserve disparate objectives, depending on whether the product category is "new"or "mature," and depending on whether the product category is in competitionwith other product categories.</tt>"fn370" [274<p>	In the case of a new product category (examples from the last two decadesmight include videocassette recorders, compact disc players, personal computersand cellular telephones), advertising attempts to inform people about generalproduct category attributes and benefits.  Because the product category is new,advertising functions as a means by which consumers learn that the productcategory exists and how it might be useful to them.  At this stage, advertisingpromotes demand for the product ]<tt>category in the course ofpromoting demand for particular brands-- although, of course, alladvertisers ultimately are interested in promoting their brands againstcompeting brands.</tt><p><tt>	As awareness of the product category spreads, advertising matters less andless in stimulating aggregate demand.  In fact, demand flattens because fewpeople remain who have not either (1)tried the product category andbecome settled users or (2) decided that they have no interest in trying theproduct category.  Consumers no longer need advertising to appreciate theexistence of telephones, gasoline, television, soft drinks, laundry detergent,toothpaste or mouthwash.  </tt><p><tt>	The aim and effect of advertising for such "mature" product categories isto promote particular brands of the product, not to promote the productcategory itself.  Many studies have found that advertising in suchmarkets-- including the cigarette market-- is not significantlyrelated to aggregate product demand.</tt>"fn377" [275  Even the IOM Report, upon which FDArelies heavily, acknowledges the lack of a relationship between aggregatecigarette demand and advertising and promotional expenditures.276  <p>	There is an exception to this rule.  Even after a product category has"matured" and advertising is no longer necessary to create awareness of theproduct, the product category may be in direct competition with other productcategories.  Electricity competes in some countries with natural gas.  Milkcompetes with soft drinks and other beverages.  In such cases, it is notuncommon to see advertisements that promote a product category rather than aparticular product brand.  <p>	However, cigarettes, like soap, are not in competition with other productcategories, and one never sees an advertisement promoting cigarettes or soap assuch.  Instead, one sees only advertisements promoting particular brands ofcigarettes or soap.  Each company that makes one of these products uses thecriterion of increased sales of its brand, not increased sales in the category,when evaluating its advertising's effectiveness.277<p>	FDA contends that cigarettes are not a "mature" market, so far as young peopleare concerned.  The Agency asserts that "[m]arket expansion, in the sense ofnew customers entering the market, must occur to maintain total tobacco salesand avoid a significant market decline."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,331.  This assertionreflects a misunderstanding of what it means for a product category to be"mature."  <p>	Every "mature" product category has first-time buyers.  Consumers who neverbefore purchased a home, a car, a television set, a washing machine, laundrydetergent or a cigarette will decide to do so.  Cigarette manufacturers are nomore dependent on new customers than are manufacturers of automobiles, soaps,dentures, etc.  <p>	Young people necessarily are new to all of these markets as purchasers.  Thatdoes not mean, however, that they lack awareness of the product category orattitudes toward the product category.  Young people are aware of laundrydetergent and cigarettes long before they reach maturity because older peoplearound them use those products.  Awareness of cigarettes is, in fact, sowidespread that they are the very model of a "mature" product category.  Thus,FDA is simply wrong in its view that cigarettes are not a mature market becausenew customers are needed.  FDA simply misunderstands the nature of matureproduct markets.]<p><tt><b>			(2)	The Primary Objectives of Advertising</b></tt><p><tt><b>				in "Mature" Product Markets Is To </b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Promote Sales of a Particular Brand</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even though advertising will not influence the absolute size of themarket, the incentive to advertise particular brands of a mature product issubstantial, in this country and abroad.  In 1994, the U.S. cigarette markethad annual sales of about $45.0 billion, the market in Japan had sales of $37.8billion (at 1994 exchange rates), and Germany had sales of $22.4 billion (at1994 exchange rates).  Gaining, or equally important, preserving,a single market-share point thus meant garnering $450 million in U.S. sales,$378 million in Japanese sales, and $224 million in German sales.</tt>"fn400" [278  <p>	Moreover, as FDA acknowledges (60 Fed. Reg. 41,330), more than one out ofevery four U.S. smokers --29 percent --may switch among brands in any given year.279  Despite this robust level ofbrand switching,280 the Agency asserts that brand loyalty is "particularlystrong for tobacco products" compared to other consumer products.  60 Fed. Reg.41,330.  Even if this were true, it would suggest only that cigaretteadvertising is particularly effective in protecting market share.  Ifrelatively few smokers permanently switch brands each year, the amount spentper smoker to ]<tt>prevent brand switching-- that is, toencourage brand loyalty-- is relatively low and plainly justifies theinvestment; it is not "wasteful" as FDA suggests.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.</tt><p><tt>	For a firm with a large market share, advertising is rational as a meansto try to preserve (as well as increase) that share against competitors.  For afirm with a small market share, advertising is rational as a means to try toincrease (as well as preserve) that share at the expense of the competitors.In a competitive market, where any firm has an incentive to advertise (topreserve or increase share), other firms have a corresponding incentive toadvertise to overcome competitors' advertising.  All firms, of course, haveincentives both to preserve whatever share they have and to increase thatshare.  Bans or restrictions on advertising thus stifle a principal means ofcompetition within a market, and tend to preserve existing market shares, atthe expense of consumers.</tt><p><tt>	Successful brand promotion in a mature product market must overcome twohurdles.  First, the advertising must attract the viewer's attention.Second, and no less important, the advertising must distinguish theadvertised brand from the multitude of other brands on the market.  Thelong-term success of a brand depends on "building the ... mostsharply defined personality for [the] brand."</tt>"fn402" [281  In short, both the advertisement itselfand the advertised brand must stand out from the crowd.  <p>	Cigarette manufacturers face a unique set of limitations in this regard intheir brand advertising.  ]<tt>First is the sheer number ofcompeting brands.  In the United States, there currently are more than 300cigarette brands on the market.</tt>"fn403" [282]<tt>Second, the media to which cigarette advertising is restrictedin this country-- the print media (including outdoor)-- arerelatively inefficient vehicles for advertising.</tt>"fn404" [283  ]<tt>Third, advertisementsfor cigarettes in the print media draw even less attention than printmedia advertisements for other product categories.  As Young &amp; Moschis haveobserved:  </tt><p><tt>"It is generally acknowledged that in a typical magazine environment an'average' advertisement receives approximately three seconds of viewingtime....  Cigarette advertisements receive the leastamount of viewing time of any major print advertising category.  This isbecause the typical cigarette advertisement is a quintessential 'reminder'advertisement-- it grabs your attention, you see the picture and you goon to the next page.  It is extremely rare for a cigarette advertisement tohold a viewer's attention for more than a couple of seconds."</tt>"fn405" [284  <p><p>	Without acknowledging such limitations, FDA merely recites, mantra-like, theamount and dollar value of advertising for tobacco products.  FDA asserts:<p>"The first and foremost compelling piece of evidence supporting restrictions oncigarette and smokeless tobacco product labeling, advertising, and promotion isthat these products are among the most heavily advertised products in America."60 Fed. Reg. 41,329.  <p><p>	This assertion is not only a ]<tt>non sequitur; its premiseis also factually incorrect.  A 1994 Advertising Age survey of the 200most heavily advertised brands in the country listed only three cigarettebrands, with only one of those in the top 100.  This survey also ranked the topten industries in terms of advertising expenditures; tobacco did not appear onthis list.</tt>"fn406" [285  In fact, cigarettesranked ]<tt>twenty-first in advertising expenditures in 1993--behind such consumer product categories as retail; automotive; foods;toiletries and cosmetics; drugs and remedies; candy, snacks and soft drinks;apparel; sporting goods, toys and games; publishing and media; beer and wine;household equipment and supplies; soaps, cleansers and polishes; electronicentertainment; and jewelry and cameras.  Advertising Age, Advertising FactBook (Jan.2, 1995).  </tt><p><tt>	The 1994 Surgeon General's Report, on which FDA relies, stated thatcigarette advertising and promotional expenditures for 1990 madecigarettes "the second most promoted consumer product (afterautomobiles) in the United States."  1994 Surgeon General's Report at 160(emphasis added).  The Surgeon General, who did not identify her source forthis claim, thus was referring to the amount spent by cigarette manufacturersin 1990 on advertising and promotion, and thus was comparing thecigarette manufacturers' combined advertising and promotionalexpenditures against other manufacturers' advertising expendituresalone.286  Such an apples-and-orangescomparison obviously misrepresents the relative spending of cigarettemanufacturers on advertising.  </tt><p><tt>	In 1993, advertising expenditures (newspapers, magazines, outdoor,transit, point-of-sale,etc.) accounted for less than 20percent of total cigaretteadvertising and promotional expenditures.  Federal Trade Commission, Reportto Congress for 1993 18 (1995).  Two types of promotional expendituresaccounted for 66percent of all cigarette advertising andpromotional expenditures:40percent for promotional allowancespaid to retailers (for premium shelf space and the like), and 26percentfor coupons and retail value-addedpromotions offered to customers.  Id.  Although FDA has other objectionsto open-shelfdisplays and price promotions, the amount spent on these promotionalactivities cannot be used to support the Agency's contention that the level ofcigarette advertising expenditures, by itself, justifies regulation.Nor can FDA argue that these promotional expenditures influence young people'sattitudes toward smoking or decisions whether to smoke.</tt><p><tt><b>				(a)  Attracting Viewer Attention</b></tt><p><tt>	Advertisers typically use attractive models in attractive settings topromote their products.  Such images are used to sell brands of everything fromfloor polish to toothpaste.  In using attractive models in attractive settings,however, advertisers are not attempting to persuade consumers that scrubbingfloors or gargling is somehow attractive.  The goal is to catch the viewer'sattention for the particular advertised brand.  </tt><p><tt>	Consumers are exposed to countless advertisements each day in a variety ofmedia.  On television, as many as 20 minutes of each broadcast hour may beconsumed by commercials, and advertisements account for more pages than text inmost newspapers and magazines.  The result is "commercial clutter."  As oneadvertising executive has stated:</tt><p><tt>"Hardly anyone in the advertising business would disagree that clutter is aproblem.  As consumers are bombarded by more and more advertising messages, itbecomes more and more difficult for advertising messages to getthrough."</tt>"fn407" [287<p><p>	Research shows that "about 13percent of magazine ads are totally missedby the reader, largely because of ad clutter,"288 and that "readers are totallyignoring 40percent of advertised names."289  It also has been reportedthat "[s]ome 85percent of magazine readers do not remember seeing theaverage advertisement."290  According to Richard Vaughn, two advertisedproducts in the same commodity group, using the same size space, can differ byas much as 12 to 1 in their ability to command attention and register theproduct's brand name.291  <p>	A number of studies have demonstrated that various measures of advertising"impact"-- such as recall and positive attitudes-- decrease as theamount of "clutter" increases in the media environment.  Viewer attention is alimited resource, and advertisers compete intensely for it.  The ability togain consumer attention, other things being equal, often is weakest in "mature"product markets because consumers are so familiar with the advertised product.Thus, advertising expenditures often must be higher in mature markets than in"new" or emerging markets if advertising is to achieve the same level ofattention.292  Every advertiser therefore seeks the most effective meansavailable to get its particular message noticed.293  ]<p><tt><b>				(b)  Audience Segmentation</b></tt><p><tt>	Broadly speaking, an advertiser in a "mature" product market can promote aparticular brand in one of two ways.  The advertiser can point to objectivecharacteristics of the brand that make that brand superior to other brands, orthe advertiser can identify the brand subjectively as the brand that isdesirable.</tt><p><tt>	There are many product categories in which an advertiser can point toobjective characteristics of a brand that distinguish it from competing brands.One make of automobile may have better mileage or require fewer repairs thananother, and of course automobiles vary dramatically in price.  Similarly,laboratory studies may in fact show that some antacids work faster and moreeffectively than others.  Cigarette advertisements also can point to the tasteof a particular brand, its type of filter, length, or "tar" ratings.  When suchobjective characteristics allow an advertiser to distinguish its brand fromothers, the advertiser is likely to stress those characteristics in theadvertising.  </tt><p><tt>	In many cases, however, brands are more or less interchangeable in"objective" terms.  Most cigarette brands, like most soft drinks and soaps, aremore difficult to distinguish from many others of the same type on the basis ofobjective characteristics.  An advertiser attempting to promote among users ofthe product category a brand that is less readily distinguishable from otherbrands therefore tries a different approach.  The advertiser aims to promoteits brand with particular groups of consumers within the product category bysaying, in effect, "If you are this kind of person, BrandX is for you; ifyou are that kind of person, BrandY is for you."  The advertiser, inother words, chooses a particular group of consumers within the productcategory to whom to direct the message, and tailors the message in a way thatis more likely to strike a responsive chord with that group.  Thus, it is notthe advertisement that "shapes" the consumers; it is the consumers (those inthe audience who already use the mature product category) that "shape" theadvertisement.  </tt><p><tt>	This is the principle of audience segmentation.  Regardless of theproduct, individuals tend to cluster in "taste cultures."  It is to thesegroupings that advertisers direct their messages-- particularly in matureproduct categories in which objective differentiation of the constituentproduct brands may be difficult.  That approach (objective differentiation) isnot cost-effective; and it is particularly inefficient when manyinterchangeable brands of a product are competing for a share of the market.</tt><p><tt>	Cigarette advertising is "targeted" to adult smokers.  Smokers, likeconsumers of other products, however, are not an undifferentiated mass.  Allsorts of people are smokers.  Cigarette manufacturers, like manufacturers inother highly competitive markets, tailor their brand messages to those whoconsume their products.  This approach is essential to the task ofdistinguishing the advertised brand from the many of other brands on themarket.  </tt><p><tt>	All advertising seeks to portray the brand being advertised in a"positive" manner, and cigarette advertising is no different in this regard.Not surprisingly, people in cigarette advertisements often appear to beenjoying themselves and taking pleasure in smoking.  Similarly, many cigaretteadvertisements depict attractive people, but that is about the onlygeneralization one can make.  Sometimes the people portrayed are confirmedindividualists; sometimes they are emphatically sociable creatures.  Thevarious cigarette manufacturers, like advertisers of soaps and colognes,attempt to attract the attention of each of these audiences.  In addressingtheir advertising to particular audiences, and in seeking to gain theirattention and preference, cigarette manufacturers are not aiming to recruit newsmokers, young or old.  They are doing exactly what other advertisersdo-- and must do-- to engage in brand competition.</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, some of the very research FDA relies upon expressly recognizedthat consumers in fact "shape" advertising.</tt>[294  For example, according to Olson, theappeal of a product depends on the objective and subjective attributesconsumers perceive the product to have.295  Some of the research also focuseson the idea that consumers have a "self image" that they wish to convey toothers.296  Advertising often attempts to appeal to users of the productcategory in terms of that self-image. <p>	FDA cites a study by Michael Solomon for the proposition that products serveas "props" that direct the consumer's behavior.297  Although Solomon does notpurport to address the direct effects of advertising, he posits that aconsumer's choice of props depends on "[t]he symbolism embedded" in theproduct.  This hypothesis, although interesting, cannot explain why thestrongest predictor of smoking by young people is the example of "significantothers," not advertising, and why smoking rates among young people in manycountries without cigarette advertising are higher than are smoking rates amongyoung people in this country.  It may or may not be the case that consumersform an "image" of a product based on, among other things, "stereotypes of thegeneralized or typical user," as Sirgy suggests.298  However, as discussedabove, the negative image that children in fact have of smokers299 is]<tt>not the glamorous image supposedly conveyed by cigaretteadvertising.</tt>"fn434" [300  This cleardifference between the image of the smoker projected by cigaretteadvertisements and the actual image of the smoker that children express toresearchers is, by itself, powerful evidence that cigarette advertising doesnot cause children to smoke:  cigarette advertising does not even instill inchildren a favorable view of smokers.]<p><tt><b>				(c)  Consumer Response to Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA overestimates the power of advertising.  Although the Agency's view ofadvertising is one that prevailed in advertising theory earlier in thiscentury, it has since been discredited.  Consumers, young and old alike, arefar more sophisticated and discriminating in their responses to advertisingthan FDA supposes.</tt>"fn437" [301  <p>	Once, it was thought that advertising had a direct and powerful effect onconsumers.  It was believed that advertisers would say, "Buy Brand X because itis superior to Brand Y"; and, if the advertisement was clever enough, theconsumer would buy the advertised brand.  In reality, however, the world doesnot operate in the way described by this "one-way flow" model.  <p>	Advertisers realize that simply disseminating a commercial message does notensure that it will be noticed.  They also learned that, even when noticed,commercial messages were not necessarily retained; and that, even when viewersfound a particular advertisement memorable, they did not always remember whatbrand was being advertised.302  Moreover, even when consumers did remember anadvertisement, as well as the name of the advertised brand, there was noguarantee that they would have any interest in buying the brand or even aproduct within the product category.  <p>	The failure of consumers to provide a Pavlovian response stems from the factthat people are not hapless recipients of advertising.303  Rather, when they donotice advertising, they are active participants who ignore, selectively attendto, laugh, counterargue, forget, or say "no" to an advertisement.304Individual audience members are the sum of myriad experiences and beliefs, andthey evaluate commercial messages not in a vacuum but in the context of theirlives.305<p>	Communication, in short, is an interactive process; the consumer does notautomatically respond to every ad independent of prior attitudes about theproduct.  As Professor Ragsdale points out:<p>"[I]t is highly unlikely that cigarette advertising plays a role in ateenager's beginning to smoke.... There is absolutely nobasis in either theory, research or common sense to believe that somehowadvertising insidiously advances to the fore and overwhelms these otherinfluences."306<p><p>	Even children are not as uncritical of, and vulnerable to, advertising as FDAimplies.307  As discussed above, for example, the mere recognition ofadvertising symbols by children does not translate into a positive attitudetoward the advertised product, as FDA assumes.  Such a "giant leap of logic... grossly underestimate[s] the ability of young children to thinkcritically, engage in perspective-taking, and make value judgments."308<p>	Counterarguments are a pervasive part of the exchange between advertiser andconsumer.  One may resist the most appealing advertisement for a high-fatice cream because one is on a diet.  One may resist a clever advertisement fora foreign automobile because one believes that domestic-made cars are morereliable or because one is pleased with the performance of one's own car.  Onemay decide against chewing gum-- despite the attractive, happy people whoinhabit gum advertisements-- because one thinks that chewing gum isannoying.  This kind of counterargument goes on all the time, most often in theform of an internalized debate.  <p>	What is distinctive about the counterargumentation that occurs in the case ofcigarettes is that no viewer (young or old) can possibly avoid thecounterargument.  The antitobacco point of view is one of the most widelydisseminated consumer messages in the world.  Indeed, in the United States, asin most countries, cigarette advertising carries health warnings.  Everycigarette advertisement is a reminder of the smoking and health controversy,and contains its own counterargument.  Without acknowledging the pervasivenessof consumer messages against smoking, FDA expresses its concern that tobaccoadvertising "overwhelms the government's health messages."  60 Fed. Reg.41,329.  Such a concern is a constitutionally illegitimate basis forrestricting cigarette advertising; in any event the concern is unwarranted.Studies show that, even among children, awareness of antismoking healthwarnings is nearly universal and greater than recognition of cigarettebrands.309  ]<p><tt><b>		d.

The body of literature upon which FDA relies consistsof studies related to advertising, marketing, and consumer behavior, the IOMReport on youth smoking, certain tobacco marketing plans, and an affidavit of apurported cigarette marketing "expert" (which the court to which it wassubmitted found unpersuasive).312<p>	The advertising and consumer behavior studies cited by FDA address the purposeof imagery in advertising and how imagery appeals to consumers.  Of thesestudies, however, only two specifically address cigarette advertising.313These two studies, as well as the IOM Report, also discuss the purported roleof "psychosocial factors" in influencing adolescents' smoking behavior.  Theexpert's affidavit and the IOM Report purport to describe how the"pervasiveness and magnitude" of cigarette advertising influence adolescents.The material relied on by FDA does not support its proposed advertisingrestrictions, for several reasons.  <p>	Most notably, the research cited by FDA lacks empirical evidence supportingthe Agency's arguments on the effects of ]<tt>imagery.  The IOMReport and the other works FDA cites make assumptions as to how the images incigarette advertising are perceived, but, as discussed below, they present noevidence of adolescents' actual perceptions of that imagery.  The IOMalso claims that empirical evidence supports a positive correlation betweenadvertising recall and smoking initiation, intent to smoke, and level ofsmoking.</tt>"fn477" [314  Nowhere, however, doesFDA or the IOM explain how advertising recall in any way causes smoking.  Infact, the studies discussed above suggest that causality flows, if at all, inthe opposite direction.315  FDA also mischaracterizes the research byoverstating the importance of imagery in the decision to begin smoking.Finally, FDA's assumptions regarding the appeal of advertising to young peopleare inconsistent with the research FDA cites in support of otherpropositions.]<p><tt><b>			(1)  Lack of Empirical Evidence</b></tt><p><tt>	The most obvious failing of this literature is the lack of empiricalevidence.  The IOM Report even acknowledges the lack of empirical data in thisarea.  It states that it is necessary to conduct "[r]esearch . . . that issensitive to youth's responses to advertising and promotional messages . . .and that assesses the success as well as the failure of advertisingcampaigns."</tt>"fn478" [316  <p>	FDA's arguments focus specifically on adolescents' supposed perceptions of theimagery found in cigarette advertisements, their supposed incorporation ofthese perceptions into their own experience, and the supposed decisionmakingprocesses that lead adolescents to begin smoking.  ]<tt>The literature,however, offers no evidence that adolescents actually perceive imagery or makedecisions in the manner FDA suggests.  FDA and the researchers simply relyon their own perceptions of the messages contained in this imagery anddescribe how, in their view, adolescents "must" perceive, process, and basedecisions upon this information.  </tt><p><tt>	The studies cited by FDA describe the supposed attractiveness of cigaretteadvertisements portraying adults and young adults.</tt>"fn479" [317  The opinions of the adult researchers onwhose work FDA relies regarding the attractiveness of various images may bequite different from those of typical adolescents.  Neither FDA nor the studiesit cites provide any evidence that adolescents themselves perceive cigaretteadvertisements in the manner described.  The IOM, for example, simply assumesthat children and youth want to "emulate" the "young adults" depicted incigarette ads.318  Another study cites an "industry critic" as stating that"cigarette marketers 'prey on the insecurity' of adolescents by targeting themwith smoking ]<tt>role models.'"</tt>"fn483" [319  We know these are "role models,"however, only because the industry critic has determined that they are.  We donot have ]<tt>evidence or data showing that adolescents viewthem or treat them as role models.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has presented no empirical evidence that potential adolescent smokersview the people in cigarette ads as "role models" or models of adult behavior.It is entirely possible that adolescents perceive the depicted images entirelydifferently than do market researchers.  In fact, at least one study points outthat perceptions of imagery and products are highly individualized.</tt>"fn483" [320  For example, a researcher couldinterpret a typical advertisement as portraying "attractive, healthy,successful young adults enjoying the beach."  An adolescent might just as welldescribe the same advertisement as portraying "rich yuppie snobs who think --mistakenly --that they're incredibly cool."  Even if adolescents did perceive cigaretteadvertisements as glamorizing smokers or smoking, the great weight of theevidence, as discussed above, is that adolescents themselves decisively rejectthat view of smokers and smoking.<p>	FDA again ignores the empirical evidence that does exist concerning thefactors that "predict" smoking behavior.  As discussed earlier in thesecomments, research shows consistently that smoking among peers and familymembers is the factor that correlates most strongly and consistently withsmoking behavior.  As also discussed earlier, the principal function ofadvertising is to create favorable brand attitudes.  That is, in a maturemarket such as the market for cigarettes, advertising seeks to create imagesthat consumers associate with the particular brand, rather than with theproduct category as a whole.321]<p><tt><b>			(2)	Function of Imagery in Brand Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA overstates the influence of imagery on teens' decisions tobegin smoking.  The research FDA cites speaks, at most, to the role of imageryin brand choice decisions.</tt>"fn489" [322]<p><tt><b>			(3)	FDA's Argument Is Inconsistent with the </b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Known Characteristics of AdolescentSmokers</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's underlying argument regarding the use of imagery is that adolescentslook to ads to determine what is "normative" or "socially acceptable" adultbehavior, or what type of behavior will enable them to "fit in" with theirpeers.  This desire to conform to the view of society, however, is inconsistentwith empirical evidence regarding adolescent smokers.  </tt><p><tt>	Both Chassin and Collins, upon whom FDA relies,</tt>"fn492" [323 found that among the factors thatcorrelated most strongly with increases in smoking behavior were particularpersonality traits.324  Chassin and Collins found that the adolescents who weremost likely to be smokers were those who were particularly "prone to deviantbehavior," who were "rebellious," who were highly tolerant of "deviant"behavior among others, and who were not "motivated to conform" with authorityfigures.325<p>	It is counterintuitive that nonconformist, rebellious adolescents fittingthese profiles would want to conform to what advertising portrays as"mainstream" or desirable.  ]<p><tt><b>			(4)	FDA's Reliance on a Stage-Based Model</b></tt><p><tt><b>				of Smoking Behavior Does Not</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Advance Its Argument That Advertising</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Contributes to Youth SmokingDecisions</b></tt><p><p><tt>	To support its belief that cigarette advertising "can play animportant role in a youth's decision to use tobacco," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,329(emphasis added), FDA also relies on a stage-based model of smoking behavior,in tandem with the suggestion that "psychosocial" factors</tt>326 play a role in smoking initiation.  60Fed. Reg. 41,329-30.  A stage-based model attempts to break down the process ofsmoking behavior into a number of discrete segments, differentiated by the timeorder in which they occur.  <p>	Such a model of smoking behavior is critical to FDA's argument.  Yet none ofthe studies cited regarding the stage-based model even attempts to prove thevalidity of such a model.327  Rather, they cite to other studies or simplyposit the model as a given.  Moreover, none of the cited studies agrees withany of the others regarding the "stages" of smoking and what the supposedstages are.328    <p>	In its effort to read substance into the stage-based model of smoking, FDAcites to the 1994 Surgeon General's Report for the proposition that "manybehavioral and personal characteristics influence an adolescent's decision touse cigarettes."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,330.  Few would dispute that proposition.Furthermore, citing Joel Cohen, FDA asserts that cognitive factors, such as afeeling of personal invulnerability, also play a role.329  60 Fed. Reg. 41,330.FDA, however, then leaps to the conclusion-- indeed, it is mereassertion-- that "[t]obacco advertising plays on these feelings andexploits these adolescent vulnerabilities."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,330.  No evidenceis adduced in support of that proposition.  Apart from snippets from tobaccocompany market research, which discuss the attitudes of young adult smokers,not adolescents, and do not describe any particular advertisements at all, FDAoffers no studies that even arguably suggest, let alone prove, itsassertion.330<p>	Buried within FDA's analysis of smoking stages is a reference to the effect ofthe age of smoking "onset" on the likelihood of becoming a regular smoker.  Thecontention that the earlier the age of "onset," the greater the chance ofbecoming a regular smoker, is maintained in only one cited study.331  AlthoughFDA attempts to use this study in its discussion of a stage-basedmodel of smoking behavior, the study itself does not make use of such a model,and its invocation by FDA, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,330, is therefore inapposite.  <p>	The cited study involved a sample of young adults (post-highschool) who had been surveyed some 5-8 years earlier as "adolescents" (6th to12th grade) regarding smoking behavior.  The authors reported that subjects whobegan smoking at earlier grade levels were more likely to report regularsmoking behavior as adults.  However, even though the authors recognized that avariety of causal models might be capable of explaining their findings, thestudy fails to control for other significant variables, such as the current ageof the "adult" subject.  <p>	In analyzing the 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Survey ("TAPS II"),Professor Howard Beales found that current age and duration of smoking, ratherthan age of onset, were better predictors of regular smoking behavior.332Because age of onset is closely related to duration, tests analyzing it tend topick up duration effects.  Beales concludes that measuring pure duration,rather than age of onset, better explains the TAPS II data.  Moreover, Bealesfound that current age is an even stronger predictor than either duration orage of onset.  Thus, the value of the Chassin study cited by FDA isquestionable at best.<p>	Furthermore, the study has a number of methodological flaws, including ageographically and racially isolated sample,333 an ambiguously described samplesize,334 and a suspect self-reporting method.335]<p><tt><b>			(5)	Young People Are Not Peculiarly </b></tt><p><tt>				<b>"Vulnerable" to Image Advertising</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA asserts that "several studies show how strongly images appeal to youngpeople"; and, on this basis, the Agency maintains that a ban on visual imageryis warranted.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,335.  Implicit in the Agency's position is theproposition that visual images appeal more strongly to adolescents than toadults, that adolescents are more susceptible to the effects of visual imageryin advertisements than adults are, or that appeal of advertisements translatesinto a decision to start smoking.  A review of the seven studies FDA cites,however, reveals that only two involve "young people's" attitudes toward visualimagery in advertising.  Five of the cited studies do not support the point atall, but rather stand for the uncontroversial proposition that visual imageryhelps advertisers distinguish their message from the clutter of otheradvertisements which confront adult consumers.</tt>"fn519" [336  Of the two remaining studies, neithersupports FDA's proposition that visual imagery is more forceful in its appealto adolescents than to adults.337<p>	The first of the two studies (from 1976) involving "young people" does noteven purport to study adolescents.338  In fact, the study participants were all11 years old or younger, and the majority were less than eight years old.Although FDA attempts to enlist this study in support of its position thatimagery has a unique effect on "young people," the trend in the data reportedindicates that any purely visual effect has begun to taper off by the timechildren reach 11 years old.  Absent other data to the contrary, this trend canonly be expected to continue into adolescence.  Thus, the study underminesFDA's main point.  <p>	Furthermore, the study was conducted with reference to advertisements forcereal, a product with which the young children could be expected to befamiliar and be active consumers.  Any extrapolation from familiar products toless familiar products not used by 11-year-oldchildren and younger is purely speculative.  When these problems are consideredin light of the fact that most of the children in the study were in the earlystages of learning to read, the value of the study is severely compromised.<p>	The second study purports to show that adolescents prefer advertisements withparticular imagery, namely cartoon characters, to advertisements with livemodels or text only.339  The study's finding that advertising using images andcolors was more likeable than text-only advertisements is scarcely surprising.In the final analysis, this study at most stands for the proposition thatadolescents, like adults, prefer visually attractive advertisements, not thatvisually attractive advertisements appeal more strongly to adolescents than toadults, ]<tt>or that they are related to initiation of smokingbehavior. </tt><p><tt><b>		e.

In support of this hypothesis, FDA cites two memoranda fromReynolds division sales managers suggesting that sales personnel considermarketing efforts in locations near high schools and colleges.  When Reynoldslearned of these two memoranda (the discovery of the first prompted an internalinvestigation that led to the discovery of the second), the company immediatelydisavowed them, countermanded the erroneous memos, and disciplined the writersfor violating company policy.</tt>"fn526" [340Nonetheless, FDA relies on these two memoranda as the sole support for itsclaim that "high school students were part of [Reynolds'] marketing strategy."60 Fed. Reg. 41,330.<p>	Clearly, two memoranda written by Reynolds employees do not constitutecompetent evidence of a company's "marketing strategy" (much less an entireindustry's), particularly where the company expressly countermanded them.

The evidence fails todemonstrate a causal connection between advertising and juvenile smoking.347Indeed, the 1994 ]<tt>Surgeon General's Report acknowledges thatthere is no research directly linking cigarette advertising to smokinginitiation.</tt>"fn559" [348<p>	To support its contention that the industry regards "as essential" theacquisition of a "starter" market, consisting primarily of teens, FDA relies ona document from a Canadian cigarette company, as though that were probative.60 Fed. Reg. 41,331.  The Agency quotes from an Imperial Tobacco Limited (ITL)document stating that the "industry is dominated by the companies who respondmost effectively to the needs of younger smokers."  ]<tt>Id.349Presumably, the "industry" and company responses referred to were those inCanada rather than the United States.  Moreover, although FDA attaches sinistermotives to this quoted language, it is entirely legal for tobacco companies tomarket cigarettes to "younger smokers" if they are of legal age.  In Canada,the legal age was 16 in most provinces at the time the ITL document wasprepared.</tt><p><tt>	Younger smokers of legal age are the intended audience forsome cigarette advertising.  These smokers are still in the process ofestablishing their usual brand.  Regardless of the spin FDA attempts to placeon the ITL document, the document itself describes marketing objectives gearedtoward younger and older people who were already smokers and is not aboutinitiating underage teens into the cigarette market, as FDA claims.  It speaksof the "needs of younger smokers" (emphasis added), not underagesmokers or potential smokers, or, as FDA would like the reader toassume, persons not of legal age.</tt><p><tt>	In a further effort to support its hypothesis that manufacturers know"that they need to develop advertising and other promotional activities thatappeal to young people," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,331, FDA cites a document indicatingthat, in 1986, ITL investigated attitudes about smoking among people age 15 andolder.  The Agency also cites to attitudinal research conducted in 1987, onpeople age 15 to 24, by the Creative Research Group Limited, a market researchfirm.  The research company, however, undertook this research on its owninitiative, in an attempt to market its services to prospective clients,unsolicited by any cigarette manufacturers.  The research, moreover, did notrelate to any aspect of the U.S. population or market.  This research, ofcourse, was conducted in Canada, at a time when, in 10 of the 12 Canadianprovinces and territories, the legal age for purchasing tobacco products was16.</tt>"fn560" [350  <p>	Ultimately, RJR-MacDonaldsubscribed to the research service offered by the company, but only after itspecifically instructed the company:  "[O]ur industry does not market itsproducts to those aged under 18.  Could you, therefore, please ensure that inyour analysis and reporting you focus your attention on the 18-24age group."351  <p>	This letter presumably was available to FDA, but FDA chose to ignore it.<p>	The Agency focuses on two sentences in a 12-page]<tt>1969 Philip Morris research paper, and claims that the paperfocuses on the reasons young people start to smoke.  In fact, the researchpaper considers why smokers continue to smoke in the face of the healthrisks associated with smoking.  The paper's discussions focus almostexclusively on smoking preferences and rationales for continued smoking.No amount of massaging can make the paper support the Agency's conclusion that"cigarette manufacturers know that young people are vital to their markets."60 Fed. Reg. 41,332.  FDA's use of a 1969 research paper --more than 26 years old --to support what it claims are 1995 marketing practices is an arbitrary andcapricious act of desperation.</tt><p><tt><b>			(2)  Advertising and Women</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA contends that cigarette advertising was responsible for an increase insmoking among young women.  As evidence for this claim, FDA relies on the 1994study by Pierce et al. of women's smoking patterns.</tt>"fn573" [352  In particular, FDA cites the study'scontention that advertising for women's brands (Virginia Slims, Silva Thins,and Eve) was positively associated with the increase in smoking initiationrates among girls, aged 12 to 17 years old, from 1967 to 1973.  60 Fed. Reg.41,333.<p>	This study, however, is flawed.  In fact, a full consideration of the dataconsulted in the study suggests conclusions opposite to those reached by theauthors.  ]<p><tt>	First, even though advertising data were readily available,the study did not examine any aspect of the actual advertising campaigns atissue.  Rather, the authors reviewed data on cigarette sales for the threebrands (which accounted for less than 3 percent of the total market) and simplyassumed that advertising caused the sales.  Additionally, the authors offer noexplanation for why such a small segment of the market (less than3percent) could be expected to affect overall initiation rates.</tt>"fn574" [353]Second, the study failed to consider obvious alternativeexplanations for its central findings-- namely, the disintegration oftraditional gender-basedstereotypes in this country at that time.  As Professor Michael Schudson of theUniversity of California has stated:</tt><p><tt>"It is more accurate to observe that smoking among women led cigarettecompanies to advertise to the 'female market' than to suggest that theadvertising created the market in the first place."</tt>"fn576" [354<p>]Finally, the methodology the study uses also undermines itsreliability.  The smoking initiation data (gathered by the National HealthInterview Surveys ("NHIS")) are fundamentally unreliable, for two reasons.First, the NHIS relied on respondents' memories of their smoking behavior,asking respondents to think back 10, 20, 30, or even 40 years to remember theexact age at which they began smoking regularly.  Not only are these estimateslikely to reflect inaccurate memories, but they could also have fallen victimto substantial revisionism.  Second, the NHIS asked respondents to state whenthey began smoking "fairly regularly."  Such a measure is almost entirelysubjective and, in any event, does not measure smoking initiation (which Pierceclaims to have studied).  Even if the data show that the studied advertisingcampaigns corresponded with increased rates of regular smoking among women, theresult says nothing about the impact of advertising on smokinginitiation -- the behavior relevant to FDA.</tt><p><tt><b>		f.

In general, however, onefinds no such relation.  Indeed, one sometimes finds just the opposite.Whether considered from the standpoint of per capita consumption or thepercentage of smokers, tobacco product consumption appears to be higher in manycountries where advertising is forbidden than in several countries whereadvertising is allowed.  Even more significantly, tobacco productconsumption-- both among adults and young people-- has beendeclining in a number of countries where advertising is permitted, whileincreasing in several countries where advertising is prohibited.</tt><p><tt>	The fact is that, in the mature market for cigarettes, advertising andoverall consumption are unrelated.  The evidence from around the worldindicates that banning cigarette advertising in a country that has permitted itdoes not affect consumption trends in that country.  As the U.S. President'sCouncil of Economic Advisers has stated, "[E]vidence from other countriessuggests that banning tobacco product advertising has not discouragedsmoking."</tt>"fn577" [355]<p><tt><b>			(1)	Trends in Smoking Among Young People </b></tt><p><tt><b>				in Scandinavia                      </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Finland and Norway have banned cigarette advertising, and Sweden hasseverely restricted such advertising.  However, as discussed inSectionB(5)(a)(4), supra, evidence from these countries suggeststhat these measures have been ineffective in reducing smoking among their youngpeople.  Tobacco use among teenagers in Finland and Sweden has been increasing,not decreasing, for more than a decade following the imposition of advertisingrestrictions.  In Norway, authors of studies in the Journal of the NorwegianMedical Association (1990)</tt>"fn579" [356and]<tt><i> </i>Psychological Reports (1992)</tt>"fn580" [357 have concluded that the advertising banin that country has had no discernible effect on the incidence of smoking.358The evidence discussed earlier merits more extended review here.]<p><tt><b>				(a)  Finland</b></tt><p><tt>	In Finland, tobacco product advertising has been banned completely since1978.  Nevertheless, University of Helsinki researchers found that smokingamong juveniles increased after imposition of the ban.</tt>"fn582" [359  <p>	This increase was in sharp contrast to the trend in smoking incidence amongthe same age group before the ban, which had been declining sharply.  Inparticular, the incidence of smoking among 12- to 18-year-oldsof both sexes had been declining sharply in the period preceding the ban in1978, but generally stabilized between 1979 and 1985.  Then, between 1985 and1987, the evidence showed "a clear increase in smoking...among adolescents."  <p>	The researchers noted that the increase had been greatest among girls aged 16to 18-- from 25 percent in 1979-1985 to 32 percent in 1985-1987.

Theauthors reported that daily smoking among adult men increased from 35 percentin 1988 to 36 percent in 1990, and daily smoking among adult women increasedfrom 20 percent to 21 percent in the same period.  The authors stated that"[t]he greatest increase in smoking over [the] two-year period appears to beamong young men."  More generally, the authors stated that smoking increased inFinland until 1976, two years before tobacco product advertising was banned.Then, <p>"the consumption of tobacco products, and smoking among young people started tofall.  However, in the mid 1980's the figures once more started to rise, and onthe basis of the situation of the early 1990's, smoking does not appear to bedecreasing at the moment."<p><p>As researchers again noted in a 1992 article, "]<tt>[i]t has been foundthat both smoking and drinking have increased among teenagers in Finland sincethe mid-1980s."</tt>"fn585" [361<p>	In 1994, Statistics Finland prepared a report for the Ministry of SocialAffairs and Health based on surveys covering the period 1980 through 1993.362One of these surveys found a slight increase in the proportion of daily smokersin the overall adult population (from 25percent in 1979 to27percent in 1993), and another found a slight decrease (from27percent to 24percent).  <p>	In sum, Finland's ban on cigarette advertising since 1978 has not resulted ina decrease in smoking, and, indeed, has not prevented an increase.]<p><tt><b>				(b)  Sweden</b></tt><p><tt>	In Sweden, tobacco advertising has been severely restricted since 1979.Tobacco advertising is prohibited on television, radio, public transportation,posters and in the cinema.  Some advertising in the print media has continuedto be permitted, but illustrations have been confined to the product pack andtrademark without decorative embellishment, and the text has been limited to"objective" information about the product's nature and properties.  Yet,smoking among 16-year-old males, which had dropped from above 40 percent in1971 to 20 percent in 1979, increased to at least 23 percent in 1982.  Duringthe same period, the incidence of smoking among 13-year-old males rose fromabout 5 percent to over 8 percent.  Following a brief, subsequent decline,smoking began to increase again in 1984.</tt>"fn587" [363  As antitobacco researchers from Swedenacknowledged in 1990, "]<tt>tobacco use is once more on the rise in theyounger age groups in Sweden."</tt>"fn588" [364<p>	In sum, Sweden's severe restrictions on cigarette advertising since 1979 didnot result in a decrease in smoking and, indeed, have not prevented an increase"in the younger age groups."]<p><tt><b>				(c)  Norway</b></tt><p><tt>	In Norway, tobacco product advertising has been banned since 1975.  Yet,according to a study in the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Associationby researchers at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Medicine,University of Trondheim, &Ouml;stmarka Hospital, the total incidence of dailysmoking among Norwegian adults (defined as persons 15 years of age and older)remained essentially unchanged between 1979 (38 percent) and 1989 (36percent).</tt>"fn589" [365<p>	G&ouml;testam and G&ouml;testam have suggested that these national data, whichwere from the Norwegian National Tobacco Council, may have understated thepercentage of adult daily smokers in 1979 and 1989, and may have misstated theactual trend.  According to their own, smaller study, G&ouml;testam andG&ouml;testam reported that 43 percent of adult Norwegians were daily smokersin 1979 and 48 percent were daily smokers in 1989.  Another survey, by theHaukeland Hospital in Bergen, found 44percent of younger adults, aged 20to 44, were daily smokers in 1992, up slightly from 43percent in 1987.366<p>	Whichever data are used, if the incidence of smoking among children 15 yearsof age or younger had declined significantly since 1975, smoking incidenceamong persons 15 years of age and older presumably would have fallen, as thejuvenile population grew into adulthood.  As noted, it did not.  Reviewing theimpact of the 1975 ban, G&ouml;testam and G&ouml;testam, in an exchange ofcorrespondence with Dr.Bjartveit, concluded that:  "]<tt>Eventhough the law to stop tobacco advertising has a meaningful content, we cannotsee that it has had a fundamental effect upon the sale or use oftobacco."</tt>"fn592" [367<p>	As the authors also observed, smoking incidence in 1987 remained higher inNorway than in the United States or Great Britain; between 1977 and 1987,smoking incidence declined more slowly in Norway than in the United States orGreat Britain; and smoking incidence among women in Norway increased duringthis period (from 29.7 percent to 33.3 percent).<p>	Further assessing the hypotheses that an advertising ban leads to reducedtobacco sales and to reduced smoking G&ouml;testam and G&ouml;testam concludedin a 1992 article that reviewed consumption statistics:  "The results supportedneither hypothesis!"  Noting as well that annual adult (over age 15) per capitaconsumption has increased from 2.08 kg. in 1981 to 2.14 kg. in 1990, theyreiterated:  "]<tt>The enacted legislation does not seem to haveaffected either tobacco sale or number of regular smokers inNorway."</tt>"fn592" [368<p>	Consistent with this conclusion, a team of antitobacco researchers told the7th World Conference on Tobacco and Health in 1991:<p>"Although Norway, in many respects, has been a pioneer in the campaign againsttobacco, ]<tt>the prevalence of smoking in Norway has changed verylittle during the last eight years. ...  [T]he prevalence ofdaily smoking among men was reduced from 52% in 1973-1974 to 40% in 1981.  Thispercentage has remained nearly constant since then.  Among women, theprevalence rate of regular smoking has been constant, about 32-33% since 1973.. . .</tt><p><p><tt>"During the period when the prevalence of regular smoking was constant inNorway, the prevalence of regular smoking in the USA was reduced by between 1/3and 1/4."</tt>"fn593" [369 <p><p>	As mentioned, some who favor tobacco advertising bans claim that smoking among13- to 15-year-oldNorwegian schoolchildren has declined sharply since advertising was banned in1975, reversing a supposedly upward trend.370  Even these antismokingadvocates, however, acknowledge studies indicating that youth smoking alreadyhad peaked by 1974, ]<tt>before tobacco advertising wasbanned.</tt>"fn596" [371  <p>	It is not even clear that the incidence of smoking in this age group]<tt>was on the rise when the advertising ban was imposed.  Althoughthe incidence of smoking in this age group was reportedly higher in 1975 thanin 1963, no one can say whether the incidence of smoking in this age grouppeaked before 1975 and already was declining when advertising was banned in1975, since "no nationwide schoolchildren study was performed between 1963 and1975.  Thus, the incidence of smoking in this age group may well have peaked asearly as 1970 when the incidence of adult smoking also peaked beforedeclining."</tt>"fn599" [372  As Aar&oslash; andothers have noted:  <p>"There was no nation-wide study of smoking among schoolchildren in Norwaybetween 1963 and 1975.  Accordingly it is not known whether the increase indaily smokers among children of both sexes ... occurred evenlythroughout the ... period or whether the trend may have reached apeak and culminated some time between the two dates."373<p><p>	Since the social acceptability of smoking has been decreasing, it is possiblethat the more recent schoolchildren studies reflected "underreporting" ofsmoking rather than the stated decline in smoking.  Also, it may be significantthat the 1957 and 1963 data and the 1975-1985 schoolchildren data werecollected by different organizations.  The two sets of data relied on byDr.Bjartveit therefore simply may not be comparable.  <p>	Finally, the Chief of the Tobacco Products Unit in Canada questioned thereliability of the studies cited by Dr.Bjartveit on the ground that thosestudies were "based on small samples of a rather narrow age range."374  TheNorway data, he said, do not offer "compelling evidence that banning tobaccoproduct advertising reduces either smoking by youth or overall tobaccoconsumption."  ]<p><tt><b>			(2)  Cross-Country Surveys</b></tt><p><tt>	If advertising were a significant influence on smoking among juveniles,one would expect juvenile smoking to be higher where tobacco advertising ispermitted than where it is not.  However, a seminal World Health Organization("WHO") survey found "no systematic differences" between juvenile smoking incountries such as Norway and Finland, where tobacco advertising is completelybanned, and in countries such as Austria and England, where it is not.</tt>"fn602" [375  Indeed, the WHO survey and the threeChildren's Research Unit ("CRU") studies found that the number of young peoplewho smoke is higher or as high in many countries where advertising is banned ascompared to countries where it is permitted.376<p>	In Finland, for example, where tobacco advertising has been banned completelysince 1978, the WHO survey found that 30 percent of 15-year-old schoolboyssmoked weekly; while in Austria, where print-media and outdoor advertising werepermitted, the WHO survey found that only 17 percent of 15-year-old schoolboyssmoked weekly.377  In both Norway, where tobacco advertising has been bannedcompletely since 1975, and the United Kingdom, where print-media and outdooradvertising continued to be permitted, 23 percent of 15-year-old schoolboyswere found to smoke weekly.378<p>	Similarly, a 16-country study by the CRU in 1989 found that the proportion of11- to 15-year-oldswho claimed to smoke regularly was significantly higher in Norway(13percent) and Sweden (10percent) than in Spain (7percent),where only minimal advertising restrictions were in effect, and far higher thanin either Hong Kong (3percent), where few tobacco advertising controlsexisted, or Kenya (less than 0.5percent), which had no restrictions.379In Norway, 36 percent of all 15-year-olds claimed to smoke regularly in 1987,whereas in Spain the figure was 27 percent.  In Hong Kong, the figure was 11percent.380  <p>	In Norway, of course, the subjects of the CRU 16-country study were too youngto have been influenced by cigarette advertising-- or the "climate" thatit allegedly fosters-- before the ban was imposed in 1975.  Indeed, someof the subjects of the study had not even been born.  By contrast, all of thesubjects of the CRU study in Spain and Hong Kong had grown up in the presenceof cigarette advertising.  Yet, the incidence of smoking among the juvenilesstudied in Spain and Hong Kong was lower by far than the incidence of smokingamong juveniles in Norway.  <p>	In Singapore, where tobacco product advertising has been banned since 1970,the Health Ministry claimed that smoking among 15- to 19-year-oldboys jumped from 5.5 percent in 1987 to 12.3 percent in 1991, and that smokingamong 15- to 19-year-oldgirls increased during the same period from 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent.381<p>	In sum, although all these countries have very different tobacco advertisingcontrols-- ranging from minimal controls to significant restrictions or acomplete ban -- one could ]<tt>not predict which country has thelowest incidence of juvenile smoking.  Clearly, factors other than tobaccoadvertising and its regulation must have played the key roles in juvenilesmoking initiation and incidence in these countries.  </tt><p><tt><b>			(3)	Tobacco Product Advertising and </b></tt><p><tt><b>				Smoking by Adults</b></tt><p><p><tt>	The evidence from around the world indicates that tobacco productconsumption by adults is similarly unaffected by advertising controls.  For themost part, the consumption trends in evidence before controls were imposedremained unchanged after controls were imposed.  Among some countries, as willbe seen, adult consumption levels are higher where advertising is forbiddenthan where it is allowed.  The effect of advertising controls on adultconsumption can be assessed from the standpoint of adult per capita consumptionor the incidence of smoking among adults.  From either standpoint, the resultsare the same.</tt><p><tt>	In Canada, despite a 1989 advertising ban that only recently wasinvalidated as unconstitutional, smoking prevalence has not changed in recentyears.  Health Canada has reported that current smoking among the totalpopulation was 31 percent in 1991 and the same in 1994.</tt>"fn614" [382  Among young people aged 15 to 19, HealthCanada found that smoking prevalence had ]<tt>increased from 23percent in 1991 to 27 percent in 1994.  </tt><p><tt>	In Australia, numerous restrictions (short of a ban) were imposed onadvertising in 1987, but these have had no apparent effect on consumption.  In1994, the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, Australia reported that smokingamong 12-to 17-year-oldshad declined from 1984 to 1987, changed insignificantly from 1987 to 1990, thenincreased from 1990 to 1993.</tt>"fn615" [383  Anassessment of consumption and advertising expenditures collected before andafter the partial restrictions were imposed on advertising concluded that"there is no clear evidence that aggregate advertising expenditure has anyeffect on total cigarette sales in Australia."384<p>	Major cross-country studies disclose similar findings.  A 16-country study ofeight former Soviet-bloc and eight free-marketcountries disclosed that smoking increased-- sharply in somecases-- between 1970 and 1984 in the Soviet-bloc countries, even thoughadvertising did not exist during this period.385  In Eastern Europeancountries, data from the WHO indicate that sales of cigarettes rose betweenfour and 22 percent from 1975 to 1989 even though advertising ingeneral-- including cigarette advertising-- was not permitted.386In Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, per capita consumption ofcigarettes declined significantly during the same period.387<p>	In the eight free-market countries, consumption trends were not substantiallyaffected by tobacco product advertising bans or strict controls.  In Italy, forexample, where advertising was banned in 1962, adult per capita consumptionincreased from a base of 100 in 1960/65 to 182 in 1984.388  In Singapore, adultper capita consumption increased from a base of 100 when advertising was bannedin 1970 to 112 in 1984 (though per capita consumption apparently has sincedeclined).389  And in Iceland, adult per capita consumption increased from abase of 100 in 1971, when advertising was banned, to 113 in 1984.390  Theimposition of advertising controls in these countries plainly did not achievethe intended purpose of reducing cigarette consumption.<p>	R. Masironi published a table showing yearly cigarette consumption per adultin 122 countries for 1985-1988.391  Masironi's table is striking because,judging by per capita consumption, one could not guess which countries allowedtobacco advertising and which did not.  His table shows many countries wheretobacco advertising was allowed, ]<tt>and in many countries where itwas banned, as having the highest per capita consumption levels:</tt><p><tt>		Country	Level</tt>"fn625" [392<p><p>		Cyprus	4050 <p>		Cuba	3920<p>		Poland	3300<p>		Japan	3270<p>		Hungary	3260<p>		Iceland	3100<p>		Greece	3040<p>		Yugoslavia	3000<p><p>	Masironi linked smoking levels to income.  Subdividing the countries, he notedthat the upper tertile (more than 2600 cigarettes per adult per year) includedcountries like the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and some Europeancountries, while the lowest tertile (up to 1300 cigarettes per year per adult)included the poorest countries of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa andSoutheast Asia.  The medium tertile included the remaining countries.393<p>	A 1993 study examining data on annual tobacco consumption in 22 OECD countriesfrom 1964 to 1990 also concluded that advertising bans did not reduceconsumption.394  That study found that advertising bans in Iceland, Norway,Finland, Italy, and Portugal had no negative effects on consumption.395]<p><tt><b>			(4)  Studies on Advertising Bans Cited by FDA</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA attempts to support its proposed restrictions on advertising contentby drawing on a number of studies which, the Agency says, provide quantitativesupport for the proposition that advertising restrictions affect tobaccoconsumption generally, and youth consumption in particular.  60 Fed.

The studies upon which FDA relies, however, provide neither "insight"nor "evidence confirming advertising's effects on tobacco consumption," as FDAcontends.  </tt><p><tt>	All of the quantitative studies contain basic methodological deficiencies,and several studies fail to control for factors that are known to beinfluential in smoking initiation, such as peer and family influences.  Asdiscussed below, the most prominent of these studies-- the New ZealandToxic Substances Board Study-- was found to be biased and so flawed as tobe unreliable by the trial court in the Canadian advertising case.</tt><p><tt><b>				1.	The New Zealand Government Toxic</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Substances Board ("TSB") Study</b></tt>"fn628" [396<p><p>	The FDA notes that a study commissioned by the New Zealand governmentconcluded that "the greater a government's degree of control over tobaccopromotion, the greater the annual average fall in tobacco consumption."397  Thestudy also concluded that "there is evidence of a relationship betweenstringent government restrictions on tobacco promotion and reduced uptake onsmoking among young people."398  <p>	The TSB study suffers from a variety of defects that undermine itsconclusions.  As the trial court in the Canadian advertising ban case noted,the TSB Study approaches its subject seeking to further an explicitly politicalagenda.  This result-oriented approach is the antithesis of objective science,and thus the Study's probative value was nullified.  As explained in detailbelow, the Study's lack of objectivity was manifested by a misuse ofmethodology in the collection and selective use of data, and a failure toaccount for other obvious societal explanations for the supposed drop-off intobacco consumption.<p>	TSB collected data on tobacco promotion and consumption for the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, as well asSingapore, for the period 1970 to 1986.399  Data on promotion and consumptionin nine East European countries were collected for the period 1980 to 1986.400In total, data were collected from 23 OECD countries, Singapore, and 9 easternEuropean countries (a total of 33).  The TSB scored each country, for eachyear, on the level of advertising restrictions placed on tobacco promotion.401Countries then were grouped into one of five categories:  total ban for healthreasons; total ban for political reasons; promotion allowed in a few media;promotion allowed in most media; and promotion allowed in all media.402  Theaverage score for each group was calculated.403  Trends in tobacco consumptionand percentage of adults smoking across the various policy groups werecompared.  The report stated that, in comparing changes in consumption andnumbers of smokers across different policy options, income level and real pricewere controlled.404  <p>	The TSB reported that per capita tobacco consumption declined 1.6 percent peryear in countries where a total ban for health reasons had been put intoeffect, compared to a 1.7 percent increase in those countries where promotionwas allowed in all media.405  The report also reported a 3.6 percent averageannual decline in the fraction of adults who smoked in countries where therewas a total ban, as compared to a drop of 1.2 percent, on average, in thosecountries where tobacco promotion was unrestricted.406<p>	The TSB report was entered into evidence in the recent Canadian case reviewingthe constitutionality of the Canadian Tobacco Products Control Act.]<tt>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. The Attorney General of Canada.407After hearing the testimony of the Canadian government's expert witness, Dr.Jeffrey Harris, and upon reviewing the TSB report for himself, the trial courthad this to say:</tt><p><tt>"With respect to the T.S.B.

Report, as anextrinsic document, is of no probative value."</tt>"fn639" [408<p><p>	FDA surely was aware of the trial court's rejection of the TSB report.  TheAgency chose, however, to rely on that report without even acknowledging thetrial court's conclusions.  <p>	The Canadian court's observations are borne out by a careful analysis of thestudy, as explained below.]<p><tt><b>					(a)	Methodological Flaws</b></tt><p><tt>	The TSB engaged in a selective use of data to support its conclusion thatthe annual rates of decline in the percentage of adults smoking was greatest inthe "total ban" countries.</tt><p><tt>	The table below illustrates the basis for the TSB conclusion.</tt>"fn641" [409<pre>										Annual %<p>	Country and 		Years	% Who Smoke	Change<p>	Year of Ban		Surveyed	Begin   End	Country	Group<p><p>	Iceland (1972)		1985-86	40.0	   36.2	-9.5<p>	Finland (1978)		1978-86	25.8	   25.5	-0.1		-3.6<p>	Norway (1975)		1973-86	41.5	   34.5	-1.1<p>	Portugal (1983)	1983-1984	na	   23.5	na<p></pre>	The rate of change for the entire group over a period spanning more than a]<tt>decade (-3.6 percent) is driven by an extraordinarily high rateof smoking cessation in Iceland in one year (9.5 percent).

Thus, the data cannot properly be averaged.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the ad ban in Iceland came into effect 13 years prior to theperiod studied.  It is wholly unrealistic simply to assume that the Icelandicdata for 1985-86 accurately represent that country's rate of change over theentire period from 1972 to 1986 (an assumption that implies more than 100percent of Icelandic adults were smokers in 1972), and absurd to assume that a40 percent reduction in 1985-86was caused by a ban imposed in 1972.  Indeed, it is not credible that anadvertising restriction would have a continuing effect --indeed, a continuing measurable effect --13 years later.  </tt><p><tt><b>					(b)	Errors in Collection and Sorting</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>of Data                         </b></tt><p><p><tt>	There are a number of errors in the TSB report that, when corrected, castdoubt on the TSB's conclusion that increasing government restrictions ontobacco promotion and advertising has a significant effect on consumption.  Forexample, the TSB characterizes Portugal as a "total ban" country, and reportsthat Portugal experienced a 5.1 percent annual decline in tobacco consumptionfor the years 1983 to 1986.</tt>"fn641" [410  Dr.Jeffrey Harris, a well-knownantismoking advocate and the Canadian government's chief expert, testified thathe considered more accurate information suggesting that the actual decline was1.7 percent.411  It also became clear that Portugal had been mischaracterizedas a "total ban" country, because it had a lower advertising restriction scorethan Sweden and a score identical to that of Italy, both characterized ascountries where promotion was allowed in "few media."  Had Portugal beencharacterized correctly as a "few media" country, the results using the NZTSBmethodology would have shown a smaller rate of decrease in the total bancountries than in countries that allow tobacco promotion in most media.412<p>	Moreover, countries that changed their tobacco promotion policy over timeappear in more than one group.  An example is Portugal, which is shown as a"promotion allowed in all media" country for the years 1970 to 1982, and,apparently incorrectly, as a "total ban" country for the years 1983-1986.Italy and France also appear in two groups, reflecting their advertisingrestriction at different times.413  However, the same is not true for Finland,Iceland, and Norway, all of which imposed a ban during the study period.  Nodata are given for these countries for the time period prior to the ban.  Othersources indicate that the rate of decline in these countries was no greaterafter the ban than before it.414  By selectively leaving these countries out,the TSB guaranteed its result.<p>	These errors caused significant overstatement of rates of smoking decline inad ban countries.  Accordingly, they seriously undermined the validity of thestudy's results.  <p>	As the Canadian Superior Court concluded about the analysis of data from theNZTSB by Dr. Harris, "the input data used . . . were unreliable and that hismethodology led necessarily to the desired result."415]<p><tt><b>					(c)	Drop-offsin Consumption and the</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Number of Smokers May Be Related</b></tt><p><tt><b>						to Events Other Than Legislated Restrictions</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The authors of the TSB study also did not account for the possibility thatany drop-off in tobacco consumption (or the number of smokers) was due toindependent factors occurring contemporaneously with the government's enactmentof advertising controls.  Total bans at the time of the TSB study had beenenacted in Iceland (1972), Finland (1978), Norway (1975) and (according to theauthors of the report) Portugal (1983).  In democratic countries, the veryprocess of enacting legislation is likely to lead to greater public focus onthe health risks associated with smoking.  In fact, the TSB concluded that"Whatever the reason for the ban, it seems that the public needs to receive aclear 'don't smoke' message . . . to ensure a decrease in tobaccoconsumption."</tt>"fn653" [416  It is certainlypossible that any drop-off in tobacco consumption or the number of smokers wasdue to reactions to these perceived dangers.417<p>	Although FDA states that the TSB controlled for the level of health educationin its comparison, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,333, the authors of the TSB report do notprovide any evidence of having done so, nor do they indicate how they wouldcontrol for this qualitative variable.  Realistically, the authors at mostcould simply distinguish between countries with health education and thosewithout.  They could not be confident of doing any more.418FDA'sassertion, therefore, is simply incorrect.  <p>	Further, the report did not discuss the effect of changing social moresregarding smoking on the governments' ability to impose controls or otherwisearrogate power.  It is entirely possible that societal opprobrium is a factorin the level of tobacco consumption, and that government restrictions are an]<tt>effect of declining demand for tobacco products, not, as thereports suggests, the cause or a cause of that declining demand.</tt><p><tt><b>				2.	The Laugesen and Meads Study on Tobacco </b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Consumption in the OECD ("L&amp;MStudy")</b></tt>"fn661" [419<p><p>	FDA suggests that a study by Laugesen and Meads confirms the findings of theTSB that prohibitions on advertising in most or all media result in more rapiddeclines in tobacco consumption.420  In fact, Laugesen was the scientificeditor for the TSB, and the article apparently relies heavily on the datacollected by the TSB.  As discussed above, those data were flawed, andcontained serious errors.  Moreover, the L&amp;M study suffers from amethodological error so basic that it renders the study unintelligible.Consequently, its results cannot fairly be read as confirming the TSB"findings."<p>	The authors postulated a relationship where tobacco consumption per adult wasdependent on a number of variables, such as the real price of tobacco products,real income per capita, the number of females in the work force,421 and thelevel of advertising restrictions in place within a country.422  They created acountry-by-country, year-by-year advertising restriction score for each of 23OECD countries.423<p>	The authors concluded that, since 1973, tobacco advertising restrictions havebeen associated with lower tobacco consumption, and suggested that theimposition of a total advertising ban would result in a significant reductionin tobacco consumption.  Prior to 1973, however, the study found thatadvertising restrictions led to ]<tt>increased tobacco consumption.This result is fundamentally at odds with FDA's theory.</tt><p><tt>	However, L&amp;M's advertising restriction score is conceptuallydeficient.  Whether a country imposes an advertising ban, requires warnings oncigarette packages, or permits advertising but requires the display of healthwarnings are qualitative choices.  Moreover, prohibiting advertising andrequiring warnings may have fundamentally different effects.  Because L&amp;Mcombined these two different policies, it is impossible to tell which policiesare responsible for the desired effect.  The United States, for example, had arestriction of 5 instead of 3 points from warning requirements and 2 pointsfrom the broadcast ad ban.  U.S. studies, however, have attributed consumptiondeclines to diffusion of information, finding no effects of the broadcast adban.</tt>"fn665" [424  Diffusion of informationwould also have a growing effect over time, which is exactly what L&amp;M find.Because L&amp;M combine different policies in the "score," their results areworthless.425  Assigning a "scaled score" to such a variable will biasresults.<p>	As an example, assume that a country has the choice of imposing:  (a) acomplete ad ban; (b) a ban on nonprint media advertising; (c) a ban ontelevision ads only; or (d) no ban.  Standard regression techniques can testthe predictive value of each of these independent variables separately.  Foreach variable, researchers would assign a value of ]<tt>either "1"or "0" depending upon whether the subject country employed thatparticular type of ban or not.  However, if researchers attempted to assign"scores" of "3" to complete ban countries, "2" to partial ban countries, and"1" to no ban countries, their assumption that complete bans are 3 times moreeffective than no bans, that partial bans are 2 times more effective than nobans, etc., would be built into the model.  Thus, the model would embody valuejudgments about the very effects it was designed to test.  Only if eachvariable is treated separately as an independent either/or variable willthe regression work properly.</tt><p><tt>	Laugesen and Meads allowed their qualitative "score" to enter in 20possible ways.

The British Health Department Report (the </b></tt><p><tt>					<b>"British Study")</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA also tries to support its call for greater advertising restrictionswith the results of a review of the literature conducted by the BritishDepartment of Health.</tt>"fn674" [426  FDA citesthisreview as providing evidence that "restrictions canhaveanimportant effect on total consumption"427 and for"inferential evidence of similar positive effects on youth smoking."428  <p>	To determine the effects of an advertising ban on consumption, the authorsconducted their own studies on three countries (New Zealand, Norway andCanada), and relied on a published study concerning Finland's experience with aban.  To determine the effects of advertising on consumption of tobaccoproducts, the authors reviewed some of the existing literature on therelationship between advertising and consumption.  The study concluded thatadvertising has a positive effect on consumption.]<p><tt><b>					(a)	The Findings Do Not Indicate That</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Advertising Restrictions Affect</b></tt><p><tt><b>Consumption&nbp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA makes the unsupportable claim that the British report found thatadvertising restrictions have had an effect on tobacco consumption.  Theauthors reviewed a study</tt>"fn676" [429explaining that, when Finland introduced a ban on tobacco advertising, thegovernment also undertook a number of other measures, such as restrictions onsmoking in public places, a prohibition on sales to 16-year-olds,and an expansion of its antismoking policy that included mandated healtheducation.  Thus, the authors themselves state that "[a]ny test of theeffectiveness of the Act inevitably amounts to a test of the whole range ofmeasures and not simply the advertising ban."430    <p>	Similarly, when Norway passed its Tobacco Act (1975) banning all advertising,it also introduced health education measures, health warnings on tobaccopackaging, and restrictions on the sale of tobacco to young people.431  Thus,any relationship between consumption of tobacco products and the Act may beattributable to the collective effect of these measures, not just theadvertising ban.  From the British report, it is impossible to determine whichof these various measures had an effect on smoking by youth.  The Britishauthors are aware of this fact; they note that their regression analysis testssimply for the response to the Act, not its specific provisions.432  FDAdisregards that crucial qualification.  This methodological flaw and others inthe British Study are pervasive and render the Study unreliable.<p>	The flaws in the British Study include:  the use of uncontrolled data,rendering proof of causation impossible433; the failure to include relevantinformation, such as the unrepresentative nature of the population of smokersin the United Kingdom434; and the failure to account for different situationsin different countries at different times.435  One commentator has stated thatthe cumulative effects of these flaws is the result that the Study "does notprovide a firm scientific basis for any change in public policy in relation tothe advertising of tobacco products."436]<p><tt><b>					(b)	The Authors' Conclusions Are Based on Data Collected over aShort Time Period</b></tt><p><p><tt>	The findings concerning Canada and New Zealand were heavily qualified bythe researchers.  They noted that a ban had been in effect for a very shorttime in these countries:  less than two years in Canada, only six months in NewZealand.</tt>"fn684" [437  Thus, considerablecaution is needed in relying on these results.438  Further, the authors failedto include income as an independent variable in their study.  This failure mayhave seriously biased the results because real income was falling in Canada atthe time the ban went into effect.439  Results from New Zealand are also highlyspeculative because the British authors could not determine, with any rigor,how the change in consumption was related to rising real tobacco prices andfalling real incomes.440  As noted, the prevalence of smoking among 15-to 19-year-oldsin Canada ]<tt>increased between 1991 and 1994, after cigaretteadvertising was banned.</tt><p><H3><a href=vol7b.htm><I>Volume Seven continued</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.
